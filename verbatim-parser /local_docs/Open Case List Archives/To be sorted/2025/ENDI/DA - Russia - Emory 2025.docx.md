[**[US and Russian officials]{.mark}** have [**identified** the
**Arctic** as a possible area for]{.mark} [economic
cooperation]{.mark},]{.underline} according to people familiar with the
situation, [[part of the broader detente]{.mark} President Donald
[**Trump** is **pursuing with Moscow**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Discussions]{.mark} have **[included]{.mark}** **[natural
resources]{.mark} [exploration]{.mark}** and **[trade
routes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, said the people, who asked not to be
identified as the discussions are private and at an early stage.
[Cooperation over [energy exploration]{.mark} is also seen as a goal by
the US, one of the people said.]{.underline}

The topic emerged as **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has aggressively
**pursued** an **end to the war in Ukraine,**]{.underline} [[including
direct talks]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's President
Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both sides have recently
signaled that they're open to business ventures and cooperation,
alarming European and NATO allies, which have sought to isolate Moscow
since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

US and Russian officials plan to meet in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss
restoring embassy staffing levels, according to Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov.

As the world fixates on the battlefields of Ukraine and the volatile
Middle East, a quieter but no less consequential struggle is unfolding
in the Arctic. [[Washington's]{.mark} latest
[maneuver]{.mark}---planning [to acquire]{.mark}
**[icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} from Finland
**[[amid]{.underline}]{.mark}** what some call [[an "**Arctic
crisis**]{.mark}"---[signals a **bold**]{.mark} **[escalation]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the **polar region** in the context of
**[competition]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **Beijing** and
**[Moscow]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[This move]{.underline}, paired with the Danish Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen's recent trip to Greenland, and President Donald Trump's
proposed energy sanctions targeting Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG)
expansion (if he doesn't change his mind), reveals a troubling pattern:
once again, this [has everything to do with the US-led [NATO's]{.mark}
**relentless** [push to **encircle Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even
at the risk of **[igniting a new]{.mark} [geopolitical
flashpoint]{.mark}**]{.underline} (even if Trump seems to be "turning
his back" to the Alliance).

[[The Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} far from being a frozen backwater,
[is poised to become the [next]{.mark} major [arena of **U.S.-Russian
contention**]{.mark}---a development that exposes **Trump's
America**]{.underline} **[imperial ambitions]{.underline}** [and
undermines claims of "**isolationism**" or of **fostering peace** and
**stability** for that matter.]{.underline} Ironically, we now have an
American president openly threatening (with annexation) the sovereignty
of NATO European "ally", Denmark, over the issue of Greenland.

The icebreaker deal with Finland is no mere logistical upgrade. Trump
has framed it as a critical step "amid Arctic security concerns," with
Washington aiming to bolster its polar presence against Russia's
formidable fleet of over 36 icebreakers. One should pay attention also
to the trilateral ICE Pact with Canada and Finland; expert Daniel
McVicar (Research Director at White House Writers Group), predicts Trump
will expand it to counter "Russian influence."

Meanwhile, the Danish Prime Minister's visit to Greenland, underscores
Washington's broader strategy to secure strategic footholds in the
region. Greenland, a Danish territory, has long been a target of Trump's
fixation---he recently reiterated his desire to "get Greenland," ---a
notion Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a "serious" U.S.
intent. These moves are not about defense; they are about dominance.

Trump's proposed energy sanctions, exceeding the scope of the 2019
measures, aim to choke Russia's LNG ambitions, which are deeply tied to
the Arctic. Russia's Northern Sea Route, a thawing shipping lane along
its Arctic coast, promises to redirect energy exports to Asia,
circumventing Western chokeholds like the Suez Canal. By targeting this
lifeline, the U.S. seeks to kneecap Moscow's economic resilience---a
tactic less about security and more about maintaining American hegemony.
[The region's vast untapped resources]{.underline}, from oil and gas to
rare earth minerals, [only **heighten** the **stakes**]{.underline}. One
may recall that the U.S. (then still under President Joe Biden, mind
you) has already claimed a "huge portion of the ocean floor" from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic, a unilateral grab that flouts
international norms and highlights the American expansionist ethos.

Increasingly warm temperatures in the Arctic region, which facilitate
navigation, present a significant opportunity for the liquefied natural
gas industry, among other benefits, hence the strategic importance of
that area. Additionally (and relatedly), still during Biden's
administration, tensions have escalated in the Gulf of Finland. It's
worth noting that NATO's further expansion under Biden, incorporating
Sweden and Finland, has extended the Alliance's territory all the way to
Russia's eastern Arctic flank (the Bering Strait), thus leaving Russia
as the sole non-NATO country in the Arctic. This is the context for
Trump's Greenland and Arctic "obsession".

[NATO's cheerleaders might argue that all of this is a necessary
response to Russian "**aggression**."]{.underline} After all, they
claim, Moscow has militarized its Arctic frontier, with nuclear-powered
icebreakers and new combat vessels like the Ivan Papanin. [But this
narrative conveniently **ignores [NATO's]{.mark}** own [**history** of
**provocations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The alliance's **eastward
creep**---absorbing **Finland** and **Sweden**---has turned the **Gulf
of Finland** into a potential "**site of new conflict**," as I've
written before.]{.underline}

Finland's integration into the ICE Pact and its icebreaker expertise,
means that the Nordic country, once a neutral asset, now serves NATO's
agenda---even when the incumbent American President is accused of
"abandoning" the transatlantic alliance. [This shift [has strained
**Arctic cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with Russia excluded from
regional forums like the **Arctic Council** since **2022**]{.underline}.
[[Far from **stabilizing** the **region**, the **U**nited **S**tates
**actions** are **fracturing it**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Greenland obsession epitomizes this overreach. Trump's fixation,
dismissed as eccentric in 2019, now aligns with a calculated NATO
strategy, even while Trumps go as far as to threaten a member ally such
as the Kingdom of Denmark. One may very well describe it as "part of a
scramble for the Arctic," (as Al-Jazeera called it) given Greenland's
strategic position astride key shipping routes and its mineral wealth.

Denmark is ramping up its Arctic defenses, yet its sovereignty over
Greenland is increasingly a bargaining chip in Washington's game.
Putin's remarks at an Arctic conference underscore Moscow's alarm: the
U.S. isn't just eyeing territory---it's projecting power into Russia's
backyard. This isn't deterrence; it's encirclement.

One must ask: who benefits from this Arctic gambit? Certainly not the
global commons. The ICE Pact and sanctions risk escalating tensions in a
region where cooperation---on climate, shipping, and resource
management---once held promise. [Even from an American perspective,
Russia's exclusion from Arctic dialogue pushes Moscow toward
China]{.underline} (the exact opposite of what Trump supposedly is
trying to achieve by means of a so-called "reverse Kissinger" strategy),
in a context of a New Cold War, thereby [forming a counter bloc that
could **destabilize the polar balance further**]{.underline}. China's
"Polar Silk Road" ambitions, paired with Russia's icebreaking prowess,
challenge NATO's aggressive dominance, yet the alliance's
response---more militarization, more sanctions---only deepens the
divide.

The Arctic should not be NATO's next frontier. Its transformation into a
geopolitical chessboard reflects the alliance's Cold War reflexes,
ill-suited to an emerging multipolar world. [[Trump's icebreaker
push]{.underline}]{.mark} and energy sanctions
**[[may]{.underline}]{.mark}** bolster U.S. leverage, but they also
[**[invite retaliation]{.mark}**---perhaps in the Gulf of Finland, or
through Russia's LNG pivot to Asia.]{.underline} [To recap, the **U.S.
claims** vast **swathes** of **seabed**, NATO tightens its grip on
Greenland, and Finland's shipyards churn out tools of confrontation.
[**This isn't security**---it's a **recipe for
conflict**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[A saner approach]{.mark} [would]{.mark} **[prioritize
de-escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[**reintegrating Russia** into
Arctic]{.mark} [forums]{.mark}, negotiating resource-sharing pacts, and
curbing NATO's northward sprawl. [The **Arctic's future hinges**]{.mark}
[on **cooperation**]{.mark}, **[not conquest]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Yet as Washington]{.mark} **[doubles down]{.mark}**, dragging its
allies along, [the ice grows thinner]{.mark}---both literally and
figuratively]{.underline}. In fact, [[the next **U.S.-Russian clash**
may erupt]{.mark} not [in]{.mark} Ukraine or Syria, but rather in [the
**frozen north**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [[where **NATO's hubris**
could **spark a fire no icebreaker can
extinguish.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Impact: US-Russia relations solve [extinction]{.underline}. Maintaining friendly relations over the Arctic is key.

[[US-Russia talks]{.underline}]{.mark} in Saudi Arabia and the
Trump-Putin phone call [[signal]{.mark} a possible negotiation for peace
in Ukraine and **new [opportunities]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
countries' [relations, **including** in the **Arctic
region**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, warming four times faster than the
rest of the world, [[may be]{.mark} the [key]{.mark} region for the
**US** and **Russia** [to **advance cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[US-Russia rapprochement]{.underline}**]{.mark} [may]{.underline}
[broadly benefit the world by [**bringing an end** to the **disastrous
war** in **Ukraine** and **reducing** the **risk of nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.underline}
**[existential]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[environmental **issues**]{.mark}
still [**demand attention**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, **[Kirill
Dmitriev]{.underline}**, [CEO of the **Russian Direct Investment
Fund**]{.underline}, [named the region as a potential setting for
US-Russia cooperation]{.underline}: "[We need to pursue **joint
projects**]{.underline}, [including, for example, in the]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline}." The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for
cooperation as the two sides have explicitly expressed interest in
exploring cooperation in energy, investment, and geopolitical issues.
Western sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation
in the Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for
Arctic shipping. US officials now see Arctic cooperation as a potential
means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is
clear that many [are **interested** in **diverse forms** of **Arctic**
**cooperation**,]{.underline} from cultural diplomacy that celebrates
the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering
Strait, [to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate
hazards faced by both nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however,
are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[[The announced plan]{.mark} [to revamp]{.mark} diplomatic
[relations]{.mark} and restore the staff of the]{.underline} [countries'
diplomatic missions]{.underline} [will significantly **[reduce]{.mark}**
[the **current obstacles** to US-**Russia scientific cooperation** in
the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By making it easier to issue visas
and travel between the two countries, [Americans and
Russians]{.underline} [will]{.underline} again [be able to]{.underline}
[conduct joint research]{.underline}, expeditions, [and scientific
conferences]{.underline} and build models to better understand the
unfolding climate emergency. [Scientific cooperation]{.underline} to
understand the changes affecting sea ice, permafrost, ecosystems, and
local communities [has been blunted by the **political fallout** of the
**war** in **Ukraine**.]{.underline}

[**[Cooperation]{.underline}** [in the Arctic can help **build regional
stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly,
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[cooperation]{.underline}** [will
**build trust**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[between the **US**]{.underline}
[and **Russia** that could]{.underline}]{.mark} [**complement** or
[**spill over** into other **crucial fields** of **cooperation** such as
**arms** **control**, **Middle East peace**, and **global
health**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
[nuclear war between the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark},
despite horrific casualties, [neither country's population is likely to
be completely destroyed **by the direct effects of the
blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The aftermath could be
**much worse**]{.underline}: the [burning]{.underline} of [flammable
materials could send massive amounts of smoke into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause sustained
global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption -- **[a
[nuclear winter]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to one model 9 , [an
all-out exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop
in global temperatures of around 8°C, making it **[impossible to grow
food]{.mark} for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave some
survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but they
would be in a very precarious situation and the [**threat of
extinction**]{.mark} from other sources **[would be great]{.mark}**. An
exchange on this scale is **[only possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[**between the US and Russia** who have]{.mark} more than [90% of the
world's]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, with stockpiles
of around 4,500 warheads each, although many are not operationally
deployed.11 Some models suggest that even [a small [regional nuclear
war]{.mark} involving 100 nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a
nuclear winter serious enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people
[at risk]{.underline} of starvation,12 [though this]{.underline}
estimate **[might be pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale
[are **unlikely to lead to**]{.mark}]{.underline} outright **[human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns. [It
is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
**existential risk from nuclear war**]{.underline} over the next
century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence intervals.
According to many experts, [the most likely nuclear war]{.underline} at
present [is between India and Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given
the relatively modest size of their arsenals, the [risk of]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark} is **plausibly [greater]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a
conflict between [the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Tensions between these countries have increased in recent years and it
seems unreasonable to rule out the possibility of them rising further in
the future.

[[The world's ability to muddle through]{.mark} the next phase of
international [**tensions** without]{.mark}]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
**[major crisis]{.underline}**, [and to prevent such a crisis from
escalating to **[nuclear Armageddon]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [is in
doubt]{.underline}]{.mark}. Falling dominoes The [evidence of
arms-control disintegration is obvious and nowadays broadly discussed
among states]{.underline}, within the world's professional community and
mass media. Still, the array of emerging systemic crises is worth
examining. The United States' and Russia's withdrawal from the 1987
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty appears virtually
inevitable. Given the US renunciation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty in 2002, this would remove the remaining cornerstone of the
nuclear-arms-reduction regime launched by the 1991 Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START I). Eight years have passed since Russia and the
United States have discussed any option for the START follow-on
agreement -- the longest pause in strategic-arms talks for 50 years.
Although both parties fulfilled their reduction obligations under the
current New START by the February 2018 deadline (albeit with a number of
reservations from Russia), the treaty will expire in 2021. The chances
for successful negotiations on a new agreement after the abrogation of
the INF Treaty, and given deep disagreements between the two parties on
ballistic-missile defence (BMD) and other important issues, are bleak
indeed. Meanwhile, Washington has been reluctant to extend New START to
2026 under the terms of the treaty, though Russia nowadays tepidly
favours such an extension. [[Against]{.mark} this [background of]{.mark}
the apparent [abandonment of]{.mark} bilateral nuclear [arms control,
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [are entering a **new**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[cycle of the **[arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unprecedentedly, [it
will include competition not only in **offensive nuclear weaponry** but
also in offensive and defensive non-nuclear strategic and medium-range
weapons, as well as in the development of **space** weapons and
**cyber** warfare. [Russia has been modernising]{.mark} its strategic
triad for more than a decade, deploying and developing two
new]{.underline} intercontinental-ballistic-missile
(**[[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) systems (the SS-27 Mod 2/3 Yars
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} SS-29 Sarmat), one submarine-launched
ballistic-missile (**[[SLBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [system]{.underline}
(the SS-N-32 Bulava-30), two heavy-bomber systems (the Tu-160M Blackjack
and PAK DA), and long-range nuclear and dual-purpose air-, ground- and
sea-launched cruise missiles (the Kh 102/101 (AS-23A/B), 9M2729 (SSC-8)
and 3M14 (SS-N-30), respectively). Russia is also developing and
deploying a new generation of nuclear and dual-purpose weapon systems
unveiled in Putin's 1 March 2018 address: the Avangard strategic nuclear
boost-glide hypersonic system; Poseidon long-range, high-speed,
nuclear-propelled and nuclear-armed heavy torpedoes; Burevestnik
nuclear-powered intercontinental nuclear cruise missiles; Kinzhal
air-launched hypersonic middle-range missiles; and a number of other
sub-strategic nuclear and dual-purpose systems.6 [Given the probable
demise of the INF Treaty, intermediate-range land-based Kalibr-type
cruise missiles and [hypersonic missiles may be
deployed]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Indeed, the US government has alleged
that Russia has already deployed a ground-launched cruise missile
similar to the Kalibr 3M14.) The United States, for its part, is
developing strategic systems for limited nuclear strikes. These include
Trident-2 SLBMs with low-yield W-76-2 warheads, B-61-12 variable-yield
gravity bombs for heavy bombers and tactical-strike aircraft, long-range
stand-off air-launched nuclear cruise missiles, and nuclear sea-based
cruise missiles. The pending US withdrawal from the INF Treaty has lent
further momentum to the development of land-based medium-range cruise,
ballistic and hypersonic systems. In the longer term, beginning in the
mid-2020s, the United States plans to modernise its whole strategic
triad, replacing heavy bombers, ICBMs and nuclear submarines with
SLBMs.7 Unlike the Cold War version, [[the new **nuclear arms race**
will be **multilateral**]{.underline}, [involving]{.underline}]{.mark}
[states such as]{.underline} **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[Israel]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [as
well as the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Russia. [The]{.mark} intensification of
the [arms race would]{.mark} undoubtedly [undermine]{.mark} the nuclear
**[non-proliferation]{.mark} regime**]{.underline}. The review
conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2015 ended in
failure, and the next conference in 2020 is likely to fail as well. The
nuclear-weapons states have reneged on their obligation under the NPT's
Article VI to 'undertake to pursue negotiations in good faith on
effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an
early date and to nuclear disarmament'. Further aggravations include the
US withdrawal from the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal on the Iranian
atomic programme, the deadlock over the concept of a zone free of
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, and the deep split
between nuclear and non-nuclear NPT states over the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons approved by the UN General Assembly on 6
July 2017.8 The probable degradation of NPT norms will prevent the
treaty from effectively addressing the challenges of the significant
future growth of the world's atomic energy and trade in nuclear
materials and technologies. As a consequence, the line between peaceful
and military use of nuclear energy through the nuclear fuel cycle will
become even blurrier. [[The]{.mark} new cycle of the [arms race]{.mark}
among nuclear-weapons states [will]{.mark} probably [encourage]{.mark} a
new round of [nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration: [**Iran** and **Saudi
Arabia** could]{.mark} well [join]{.mark} the nuclear club, [as could
**Brazil**]{.mark}, **[Egypt]{.mark}**, **[Japan]{.mark}**,
**[Nigeria]{.mark}**, **[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea**, [**Taiwan** and
**Turkey**]{.mark}, among others. [This would]{.mark} eventually [seal
the fate]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the]{.underline} Comprehensive Nuclear
Test-Ban Treaty (**[[CTBT]{.underline}]{.mark}**), which for 23 years
has not entered into legal force because of the refusal of the United
States and several other nations to ratify it. [Under the thunder of

**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty, on which negotiations have been

I was here last week to interview Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at
the Tikvah Israel Security Conclave. The interview, available on the
Journal's website, combined a tour d'horizon of Mr. Netanyahu's view of
world politics with some candid reflections on the history of Zionism.
As for the rest of the conference, I came away thinking that [[the U.S.
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [**much [close]{.mark}**r [to]{.mark} getting
involved in]{.underline} **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nother
[**[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East war]{.mark}** than]{.underline}
**[most]{.underline}** in Washington [**understand**, and]{.underline}
that **[minimizing]{.underline}** [this danger requires]{.underline}
**[rapid]{.underline}** and sweeping **[policy change]{.underline}**
from an administration still struggling to comprehend the most serious
international crisis since the late 1930s.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [came to office with an
elegant]{.underline} and cohesive geopolitical [strategy]{.underline}.
It would address the China challenge by driving wedges between China and
its fellow revisionist powers. It would park Russia by accommodating
Vladimir Putin and stabilize the Middle East by reviving the nuclear
deal with Iran even as it pursued aggressive trade and security policies
to limit China's rise.

From the outset, [the administration knew that the American-led world
system was in trouble, but it **underestimated**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[severity of the threat]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[misunderstood its causes]{.underline}**. To its
credit, Team Biden saw the China challenge clearly from day one, but
failed to understand how weak the foundations of American power had
become or how far the revisionist powers---China, Russia, Iran and
hangers-on such as Venezuela and Syria---were willing to cooperate to
weaken an American hegemony they both resented and despised.

Two years later, the Biden administration is struggling to manage the
failure of its original design. Its aggressive rhetoric and policy
toward China have intensified China's hostility, but instead of facing
an isolated China in an otherwise calm world, the administration faces
simultaneous confrontations in Europe and the Far East. Russia isn't
parked, Iran isn't pacified, and the three revisionists are coordinating
their strategy and messaging to an unprecedented degree.

Worse, **[[Iran's]{.underline}]{.mark}** [inexorable march]{.underline}
toward nuclear weapons, [combined with its]{.underline} deepening
[**[partnership]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} [**Russia**,
is]{.underline} **[driving]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[Middle East]{.underline}** **[steadily [closer]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[to a **war** that]{.underline}]{.mark} is [likely to]{.underline}
**[[engage the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}**---one that the Biden
administration desperately wants to avoid.

[For]{.underline} Mr. **[Putin]{.underline}**, [a]{.underline} **[major
military confrontation in the Middle East]{.underline}** [would be
an]{.underline} **[unmitigated blessing]{.underline}**. **[[Oil]{.mark}
prices]{.underline}** [[would]{.underline}
**[spike]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, filling]{.underline} **[Moscow's
coffers]{.underline}** [and intensifying]{.underline}
**[pressures]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} [**Europe**. [The Pentagon
would]{.mark} have]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[[split]{.underline}]{.mark}** available
**[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** between Ukraine and Middle East
allies. [The balance in]{.underline} the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** Strait
[would]{.underline} significantly **[shift]{.underline}** in China's
favor. [Spiking energy prices would boost]{.underline}
**[inflation]{.underline}** in the U.S. just as Mr. Biden tries to
persuade antiwar Democrats to support another American military venture
in the Middle East.

And while in a perfect world Russia might oppose an Iranian nuclear
weapon, under current [[circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark}---in which
Mr. Putin desperately needs Iran to help disrupt American strategy---Mr.
Putin might well decide to help Iran cross the nuclear threshold.

But the Russian dictator doesn't need to go that far. Simply by
increasing Iranian military capabilities that limit Israel's ability to
attack Iran's nuclear facilities, Mr. Putin [[could]{.underline}
**[force Israel]{.underline}** [into]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} **[[pre-emptive strike]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that
would set off a]{.underline} **[regional war]{.underline}**.

The U.S. can't compel Iran and Russia to avoid actions that trigger a
new Middle East war, but strong policy on our part still might deter
them. Unfortunately for the Biden administration, that involves
precisely the kind of hawkish Middle East posture that many
Democrats---including senior Biden officials---viscerally loathe. The
American approach to Saudi Arabia will have to move from a fist bump to
wholehearted embrace. Drone attacks and other provocations by Iran and
its allies against the Saudis, Emiratis and their neighbors will have to
be met with the kind of American military response that leaves no doubt
of our determination to prevail.

[[The best way to]{.underline} **[avoid war]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, and
to]{.underline} **[minimize]{.underline}** **[direct]{.underline}**
American [engagement should war **break out**, [is
to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[ensure]{.underline}** [that our]{.underline}
Middle East **[allies]{.underline}** [have the]{.underline} [**power to

INTRODUCTION: FORCE IF NECESSARY BUT NOT NECESSARILY FORCE

[**The world appears unhinged**. [Instability from]{.mark} the [**Middle
East**, **Caucasus**, **Africa**, and **Central America** to
**Asia**]{.mark} abound]{.underline}. The Study of Terrorism and
Response to Terrorism database identified fewer than 300 major terrorist
incidents between 1998 and 2004 in the Middle East and North Africa. In
2013, they listed 4,650 such incidents.1 Quieter cracks tear at the
fabric of South America and parts of Asia. Although geographically
distinct, [many of these [areas of instability]{.mark}]{.underline}
share underlying causes that [give rise to threats to the]{.underline}
United States and [the **global community**]{.underline}.

Human-generated causes include corruption, poor governance, absence of
the rule of law, violence, gross human rights abuses, climate change,
environmental degradation, a weak civil society, and a lack of
professional capabilities across skill sets within the government
departments needed to effectively manage the operations of a well-run
state.2 Natural causes include disasters, disease, demographic changes,
and limited access to the resources essential for life.

[When]{.underline} these human or natural [causes]{.underline} create
conditions that [[result in poor provision of]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
unequal access to essential services, such as water, food, shelter,
[[health services]{.underline}]{.mark}, education, and economic
opportunity, [[people lose confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in government
and hope for their children and their future. [They
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} restless, demonstrate, can become
[[violent]{.mark} [and overthrow]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as the self-immolation of
Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian cart vendor, which sparked 35 more
selfimmolations by extralegal businessmen and started the Arab Spring),
[or]{.underline} can [result in mass migrations]{.underline}.3 Desperate
human security, [conditions create desperate people **undermining
stability**]{.underline} and creating even more demands from host nation
governments and governments in neighboring states.

Although force and counter terrorism programs are sometimes needed to
address security threats, [enormous opportunities are available to use
nonkinetic capabilitie]{.underline}s within the Department of Defense
(DoD), Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development,
other U.S. Government agencies, and civilian organizations [to address
the underlying causes of instability. **[Global health diplomacy]{.mark}
is an underutilized strategic asset to do this**]{.underline}. At a far
lower cost, [it will save lives, decrease economic losses, reduce the
need for kinetic military operations, increase security cooperation,
improve diplomatic relations, encourage trade, and **create the
foundations for longterm stability**]{.underline}.

HEALTH IS A NATIONAL SECURITY IMPERATIVE---DISTANT HEALTH THREATS ARE
GLOBAL THREATS

[Health is a national security imperative. The]{.underline} second- and
thirdorder [effects of a]{.underline} strategic health or [global health
issue that severely impacts]{.underline} and overwhelms the stability of
[a far-distant nation can have **broad and multiplying effects**
that]{.underline} transcend boundaries and can [become]{.underline}
regional and **[global security threats]{.underline}**. When human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome first started
to be seen in the United States, there were U.S. leaders that were not
too concerned about its impact on the general public, alluding to the
fact that it was a disease that mostly affected the four H's:
homosexuals, heroin addicts, hemophiliacs, and Haitians.4 From its first
known cases in 1981 up to 2013, human immunodeficiency virus has
infected almost 78 million people and killed about 39 million.5 The
Chernobyl power plant accident that occurred on October 26, 1986, was a
catastrophic nuclear accident. Several studies have been done to
estimate the increase in health effects and cancer-related morbidity and
mortality in Europe.6 Communicable diseases can be easily carried from a
distant area of the world to a teeming metropolis within 24 hours
because of the ease and affordability of plane travel. The
interconnectedness of countries as a result of trade has its
drawbacks--- biological or chemical contamination of food or products
commonly occur across oceans and continents.7

Noncommunicable diseases are also affecting not just high income
countries but also low-to-middle income countries. Ubiquitous exports of
fast-food meals, high-fructose drinks, and salty, fried foods have
contributed to a tremendous increase in obesity and hypertension.8 Obese
and sedentary populations negatively impact the workforce of a nation
and its productivity. The offices of military personnel and readiness
cite obesity as the number one disqualifying reason for new recruits.9
Twenty seven percent of the U.S. young adults are not fit to serve in
the military.10

Addiction to illegal drugs is an important global health threat. The
problems created by the manufacture of opium in Afghanistan,
methamphetamine in Mexico, and cocaine in Peru and Columbia create
tremendous and devastating health effects, loss of productivity, social
disruptions, breed corruption in a nation's military and police forces,
and create turbulent violence all along its wake, both in the countries
manufacturing the drugs and the countries importing them.

Weather forecasters often discuss the multiplying effects that the
fluttering of a butterfly's wings in one country may have on the
regional weather of another distant country. Global health professionals
and more and more of our military and political leaders are now
concerned that the disease that we see in a child in Africa or a pig in
Asia may have tremendous impacts on the public health, economic
productivity, military readiness, and strategic security interests of
their nation. In addition, a weak health and political system anywhere
can be a threat everywhere.

LINKAGES: GLOBAL HEALTH, SECURITY, AND STRATEGIC CHALLENGES

Global health encompasses the basic needs required for human security:
respect for people's universal rights, personal protection, the rule of
law, access to food, water, health care, education, basic
infrastructure, and shelter.11 Their absence leaves populations
vulnerable to the depredations of insurgent groups and corrupt, venal
cabals that can hijack a region or state for the benefit of themselves
and a select group of people. This creates an environment of the
privileged and abused, the included and excluded, and an environment
ripe for insecurity and conflict.12

For a nation to provide the environment where people's basic needs can
be met requires capabilities within their governing infrastructure and
communities. This includes management, finance, education, social
sciences, law,medicine, [public health]{.underline}, engineering,
veterinary medicine, agronomy, and more. Their [absence
\[undermines\]]{.underline} ~~cripples~~ [a nation's ability to support
a foundation for]{.underline} human security and
[stability]{.underline}, inhibits its ability to thrive in good times,
and respond effectively to natural and man-made threats in bad times.
[It breeds corruption, poverty, poor health outcomes, spread of lethal
diseases, gross human rights abuses and conflict. This we have seen
played out with grim efficiency in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria,
Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic,
Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria, Honduras, and beyond. All have had
**disastrous regional effects**]{.underline}, many have created direct
threats to U.S. interests.

Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was borne out of the brutal kleptocracy
of Assad's Syria and a destructive government in Iraq. Al-Shabaab was
created in the failed state of Somalia. Boko Haram grew in the destitute
and neglected regions of northern Nigeria. Al Qaeda and the Taliban
secured a haven in the lawless western regions of Pakistan. Weak
governments in Central America created a fertile ground for organized
criminal gangs to terrorize the populace and profiteer off the illegal
drug trade that destroys lives, and drives people to desperately flee
northward into the United States.

Insurgencies, terrorist organizations, and other nonstate actors thrive
in the presence of an incompetent or abusive state government that
violates segments of its citizenry and fails to provide an environment
where peoples' rights are protected and their basic needs met. These
groups divine counter narratives that take advantage of people's lack of
hope and fears. They create a refuge and an outlet for people's rage.
Such messages and place of belonging can be a powerfulmagnet for youths,
the poor, and the disenfranchised,who see little hope in the future.
Security threats are not only manmade but also can come from nature. The
international community's failure to dramatically reduce our carbon
footprint leaves us vulnerable to an increasing number of extreme
weather events that threaten everything from coastal communities to food
and water security. This will amplify existing tensions over natural
resources and could result in the forced migrations of massive numbers
of vulnerable people. The world's population is expected to reach 9
billion by 2030. The growth will primarily occur in cities in the
developing world most of which already have fractured or nonexistent
infrastructure. Climate change will have a dramatic effect on densely
populated poor urban areas, especially those in arid zones and in
littoral areas. This is a recipe for disaster.

Environmental degradation is also increasing the spread of infectious
diseases and facilitating zoonoses to jump the species barrier and
infect humans. The Ebola outbreak, like severe acute respiratory
syndrome and H1N1 before it, is part of a long list of diseases that
have infected humans from an animal reservoir with devastating impact.
Many zoonoses exist and more will come. Using history's guide, the next
pandemic will likely be a zoonotic agent. Recognizing this, the United
States last year led the creation of the Global Health Security Agenda
to prevent, detect, and respond to deadly disease outbreaks.13 Though
accepted by many countries, it has been implemented by few. No amount of
force can resolve these challenges. [However, global health
diplomacy]{.underline}, exercised through civil-military and
military-military programs, [is a promising strategic tool that should
be employed to address]{.underline} these wicked strategic or [global
health problems and improve]{.underline} domestic and [international
security]{.underline}.

AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT

Despite a growing level of interest in academia and government agencies,
there is little agreement on how to define "global health diplomacy."14
Michaud defined it as "international diplomatic activities that
(directly or indirectly) address issues of global health importance, and
is concerned with how and why global health issues play out in a foreign
policy context."14 The World Health Organization (WHO) states that it
"brings together the disciplines of public health, international
affairs, management, law, and economics, and focuses on negotiations
that shape and manage the global policy environment for health."15 We
summarize global health diplomacy as the application of a broad range of
skill sets to cooperatively improve human security throughout the world.
A vital area of focus must be to strengthen public service, governance
capabilities, and civil society in unstable regions. Doing so will
enable nations to create an environment where their citizens' basic
needs can be met, universal rights respected, and the ability to hold a
government to account, secure. This includes building and retaining
capabilities to manage effective, noncorrupt, justice, finance, health,
education, defense, public works, and environmental departments. The
absence of these structures cripples a country's ability to govern
itself and leaves it vulnerable to the causes of instability, both human
and natural.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, **by virtue of its
[strengths]{.mark} across diplomacy, defense, development, trade, and
its inherent domestic civilian capabilities**, [has an opportunity to
**exercise its leadership**]{.mark} and **mobilize these assets**. Using
[global health diplomacy]{.mark} to comprehensively strengthen public
service and governance capabilities has been chronically neglected by
the international development community. It **[needs a leader]{.mark}**
[to start this process]{.mark} and the United States has the **ability**
and **authority** to do so in the national and international
interest]{.underline}.

[[Discussions]{.mark} have **[included]{.mark}** **[natural

identified as the discussions are private and at an early stage.
[Cooperation over [energy exploration]{.mark} is also seen as a goal by
the US, one of the people said.]{.underline}

The topic emerged as **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has aggressively
**pursued** an **end to the war in Ukraine,**]{.underline} [[including
direct talks]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's President
Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both sides have recently
signaled that they're open to business ventures and cooperation,
alarming European and NATO allies, which have sought to isolate Moscow
since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

US and Russian officials plan to meet in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss
restoring embassy staffing levels, according to Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov.

#### Russia is [open]{.underline} to a bigger role in Arctic cooperation, but it's [contingent]{.underline} on the US [backing off]{.underline} unilateral competition.

[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[on **ensuring**]{.mark} [**stability**
in the **Arctic region**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Russia's embassy in

\"Russia assumes that security in the Arctic should be built by joint
efforts of countries of the region through dialogue and cooperation.
[[Russia is open to cooperation]{.mark} with the US [on a **mutually

the embassy said amid reports of a visit by the American delegation to

president also commented on Washington's plans to gain control over
Greenland, noting that it was a matter for the two sovereign states -
Denmark and the United States - to decide. It \"has no relation\" to
Russia, Putin added.

#### US-Russia relations are [rebounding]{.underline} post-Biden. The Arctic is key.

\"Russia and US eye joint Arctic energy projects after Saudi talks.\"

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-saudi-arctic-energy-rdif-ukraine-russia-capital/

[[**Russia** and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
**[discussed]{.mark}** possible [**cooperation** on energy
projects]{.mark} [in **the Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} at a meeting in
Saudi Arabia Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO.

Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment
Fund (RDIF), said the economic conversations had been about broad
strokes, but that the two sides had discussed some "specific areas of
cooperation."

"It was more a general discussion --- maybe joint projects in the
Arctic. We specifically discussed the Arctic," Dmitriev said by phone as
he boarded a flight home after the talks in Riyadh.

The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst
and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and
Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine's future
without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies.

For his part, **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[aims to expand
**American influence**]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, having
repeatedly mused about acquiring Greenland from Denmark --- and has
refused to rule out using military force or economic coercion to seize
control of the massive island with its vast mineral wealth and key
strategic location.

U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian state oil major
Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic, but pulled out
in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in response to
Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Dmitriev was part of [a Russian delegation]{.underline} that included
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri
Ushakov and was in Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine.
Tuesday's talks were the first contact between officials from the two
sides following a call between Trump and Putin last week.

He [commented on the [economic **track of the
talks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which he [**described** as
**good**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but declined to go into detail on the
political discussions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S.
delegation, accompanied by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and
Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

"[**[Positive]{.mark}** [after]{.mark} the **[Biden]{.mark}
administration** [destroyed all of the **communication**, **destroyed**
all of the **discussion**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the
RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around \$300 billion as a result of
leaving Russia following Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022.

"[There is an understanding that [bad relations between Russia and the
U.S. actually]{.mark} [cost]{.mark} a lot to [American business]{.mark},
and there are ways to have productive cooperation **benefit** both
**Russia** and **the U.S.**"]{.underline} he said.

"I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going
forward, but I think [**[joint investments]{.mark}** between
Russia]{.underline} [and the U.S. [are **now more likely**]{.mark}
[after this **meeting than before**]{.mark},]{.underline}" he added.

[On next steps, [Dmitriev]{.mark} said the two sides had [**agreed to
set up working groups** and have **regular high-level
contacts**]{.mark}.]{.underline} No further meetings have yet been
scheduled.

The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on
projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign
fund was sidelined following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as
foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia.
Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a
statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

Affairs Council. \"Is global ice-breaker race imminent?.\" Global Times.

[The looming ice-breaker race is not as spectacular as the
aircraft-carrier race, which is in full swing already]{.underline}. And
yet, [such a race]{.underline} is likely to have significant detrimental
implications for the future of the Arctic. It [might inadvertently lead
to more tensions and **even** to **direct conflicts**]{.underline},
particularly if it overlaps with enhanced military activities in the
region. One can mention, for instance, that in early 2024, NATO
conducted its Nordic Response exercises involving about 50 military
vessels, more than 110 aircraft, 20,000 servicemen from 14 countries.
Later, Canada announced that it was going to purchase 12 modern
submarines specifically designed to operate in the Arctic region.

[The **good news**, however, is that [the **West** might have a
**deficit of material**]{.mark} [**resources** and **political
will**]{.mark} [to **wage** a **large-scale ice-breaker race** with
**Moscow** and **Beijing**. ]{.mark}]{.underline}One can recall that the
fuss about the US lagging behind Russia and China in the Arctic region
repeats itself every couple of years. [[The last ice-breaker fever took
place under]{.underline}]{.mark} former US president Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There was much speculation about how
Washington could bring its presence in the High North to a new level.
However, [[nothing much has really happened since
then]{.underline}]{.mark} - the new Invincible Armada has never
materialized[. [It cannot]{.underline}]{.mark} [fully [be ruled out
that]{.mark} exposed to harsh **economic** and **political

[One can argue that there is **nothing wrong** with **international
competition**]{.underline}, [including in the **ice-breaker building
industry**]{.underline}. However, the devil is in the details. **[[For
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[building ice-breakers is not a matter

**economic necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Out of the overall 4
million people who currently reside north of the Arctic Circle,
approximately half live in Russia. [The]{.underline} [largest Arctic
cities also happen to be Russian]{.underline} - Murmansk, Norilsk,
Vorkuta, to mention a few. [[The]{.underline}
[country]{.underline}]{.mark} [desperately [needs]{.mark} to keep
all-season **[communication]{.mark}** [lines in

fully **operational fleet** of ice-**breakers** is a]{.mark} **[natural
way]{.mark}** to **keep these lines open**]{.underline}; all available
alternatives offered by ground or air transportation would be much more
expensive.

As for Beijing, it released its Arctic Policy paper in 2018, in which
China was positioned as a \"Near-Arctic State.\" It is a major
stakeholder in the North, but its interests are confined mostly to
potential energy and other resource exploration as well as
transportation and wild-life preservation.

**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** [began reinvesting in **Arctic affairs

in asserting complete control over the **Arctic Zone** of the **Russian

through interdiction capabilities away from the Russian Arctic, and
protecting perceived vital interests along the Northern Sea Route (NSR).
Russia has been rapidly militarizing NSR approaches, especially across
critical choke points,10 and modernizing local infrastructure.11

Under the impact of climate change, more waters and coastlines in and
close to the AZRF and the NSR are becoming accessible. [[In Moscow's

[[The Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline} [has rapidly [emerged as a
**strategically** critical **geopolitical zone,**]{.mark}]{.underline}
driven largely by significant environmental changes that have unveiled
new economic and security opportunities. [With melting ice opening
access to vast reserves of]{.underline} oil, natural gas, and
**[minerals]{.underline}**, alongside emerging maritime routes like the
Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, [the **region** has become
[**increasingly contested** by **major global
powers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Under the Trump administration, U.S.
policy towards the Arctic was assertively **reshaped**, prioritizing
**energy independence**, national security, and **economic
deregulation**]{.underline}. [These shifts highlight broader strategic
ambitions while simultaneously sparking debates around **environmental
sustainability**, diplomatic cooperation, and **geopolitical
stability**.]{.underline}

The **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration's [[policy]{.mark}
[reflected a **clear emphasis** on exploiting the **Arctic's**]{.mark}
**[economic potential]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through resource
extraction and **increased commercial** **shipping**.]{.underline}
However, such a focus drew significant criticism from environmentalists
and indigenous communities, concerned about the irreversible ecological
impacts and acceleration of climate change due to aggressive development
strategies. The administration's rollback of environmental protections
to facilitate drilling operations underscored its prioritization of
short-term economic benefits over long-term ecological sustainability.

A particularly striking illustration of Trump's Arctic strategy was his
repeated interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark, first expressed
publicly in 2019 and reiterated again more recently in 2025. This highly
controversial proposal highlighted Greenland's strategic importance,
particularly its potential as a base for military and economic
expansion, reflecting Trump's broader ambition to assert American
dominance in the region. Greenland's leadership swiftly and firmly
rejected the proposal, underscoring the significance of national
sovereignty and self-determination. This diplomatic tension illuminated
broader sensitivities and complexities in Arctic geopolitics, including
issues of sovereignty, national identity, and resource nationalism.

[[The administration's]{.mark} [focus]{.mark} also significantly
[addressed]{.mark} **[national security]{.mark} concerns** arising from
**increased Russian military activities** and strategic advancements in
the Arctic.]{.underline} In response, [the U.S. [**intensified** its
**military presence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[investing heavily
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**essential [infrastructure]{.mark}**
[like]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[icebreakers]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
surveillance systems. [[Trump]{.mark}-era]{.underline}
[[rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark} consistently
**[[emphasized]{.underline}]{.mark}** the need for American leadership
in safeguarding national interests, framing [the Arctic as a critical
arena for geopolitical [competition]{.mark}, particularly **[against
Russian]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Chinese
**[[ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

However, critics argued that [the **[Trump]{.mark}** [administration's
**largely unilateral**]{.mark}]{.underline} and [short-**sighted
[economic]{.mark}** [approach]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**risked
destabilizing**]{.mark} established [multilateral frameworks]{.mark}
[such as the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These
frameworks]{.underline} historically [facilitated]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} among Arctic nations, providing a balanced
mechanism for managing shared resources, mitigating environmental risks,
and **[reducing geopolitical tensions]{.underline}**. [[Trump's reduced
**commitment** to such cooperative]{.mark} [frameworks]{.mark} [risked
alienating traditional allies and **intensifying regional rivalries**,
**potentially undermining long-term stability.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The economic opportunities presented by the Arctic region are
undoubtedly significant, particularly regarding shorter shipping routes
and abundant natural resources. Nonetheless, the risks posed by rapid
development without robust environmental safeguards are equally
substantial. The potential for ecological disasters, acceleration of
global climate impacts, and disruption of local indigenous communities'
livelihoods remain critical concerns. Additionally, heightened
geopolitical competition absent meaningful diplomatic engagement could
escalate tensions, increasing instability within the region.

Trump-era Arctic policy thus exemplifies a broader geopolitical
challenge: balancing immediate economic and national security interests
with the imperative for sustainable development and cooperative
international relations. As the Arctic continues to evolve due to
climate change and geopolitical pressures, it becomes increasingly
crucial for policymakers to adopt balanced, sustainable strategies.
These should emphasize not only resource management but also meaningful
engagement with indigenous communities, enhanced diplomatic
collaboration, and comprehensive environmental stewardship.

Ultimately, [the growing strategic importance of the Arctic in a new
Trump era underscores critical lessons in **geopolitical
decision-making**]{.underline}. Future policy must reconcile short-term
national ambitions with the long-term demands of ecological
sustainability and international cooperation. An integrated and nuanced
approach is essential to navigating the complex opportunities and
challenges emerging from this dynamically evolving region.

coastline. Not only is the Passage very complicated for navigation, it
is also a matter of a long-term dispute between Washington and Ottawa -
the Canadian government considers the Passage as a part of Canadian
internal waters, while the US claims that this is an international
strait allowing free and unencumbered navigation. In any case, [it is
hard to imagine that either the US]{.underline}, or Canada, or any other
nation, [will invest dozens of billions of taxpayers\' dollars in trying

What are the stakes for **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

On December 11, speaking at the convention for the development of key
residential areas in the Arctic region, Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**
[explicitly [stated]{.mark} that the "[**development** of the **Arctic**
is an **undisputed**]{.mark} [**priority** for the **Russian
Federation**]{.mark}]{.underline}" due to its colossal geo-economic
potential as well as a factor of Russia\'s national security and
defence.

In my view, however, [[for Russia]{.mark} the value of [the Arctic
region]{.mark} well [exceeds]{.mark} **geo-economic interests** and
rather **illusory [security concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In the
**light** of **Russia\'s**]{.underline} [post-2014 transformation
translated into re-emerging neo-imperial expansionism[, it is clear that
the **Arctic** has **transformed** into a **fundamental pillar** of
Russia\'s **statehood** and **national identity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
At this juncture it is worth remembering that in 2015---after Kremlin\'s
neo-colonial territorial grab in Ukraine and initiation of the new
chapter of "adventures" on the Middle East---Russia officially stepped
forward with a territorial claim in the Arctic, giving a new breath to
the idea of "Arctic exceptionalism".

Thus, [one might theorize that [**prospective** **geopolitical
defeat**]{.mark}]{.underline}(s) [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}---in addition to overall humiliating course
of Russia\'s war in Ukraine, economic stagnation and traces of political

Meanwhile, [the **Arctic region** boasts **rich natural
resources**]{.underline}. It holds about 13% of the world\'s oil, 30% of
the natural gas, 25% of the coal, [and a significant amount of rare
minerals.]{.underline} [In December]{.underline} 2023, [[the US
unilaterally]{.mark} [announced]{.mark} its [**claims** to extend its
**continental** **shelf**]{.mark} in the **Arctic Ocean** and **other
regions**]{.underline}. [It is widely believed that the **move** is
**primarily [driven]{.mark}** [by a **desire** to access]{.mark} the
**rich [mineral resources]{.mark}** in the **region**,]{.underline}
[particularly **lithium** for **battery manufacturing** and
**tellurium**]{.underline} [for solar **panel production**]{.underline}.
According to RIA Novosti, the Arctic Ocean seabed is estimated to
contain resources equivalent to 83 billion tons of standard fuel. [The
possibility of discovering new large-scale oil and gas reserves in
unexplored]{.underline} continental shelf [areas is also **very
high**]{.underline}. However, [[the **unilateral pursuit** of]{.mark}
its **[interests]{.mark}** [by the **US undermines**]{.mark} the
**peace** and [**stability** of the **Arctic**
]{.mark}**region**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Its **behavior** is

and [**contradicts** the **trend** of **peace** and

Peace and stability in the Arctic provide a significant guarantee for

Take 2: With Russia effectively banished from Arctic cooperation, there
has been increasing media attention on the expansion of military
facilities, the testing of new weapons, military exercises, and even
statements about nuclear weapons use in the Arctic. Both sides -- NATO
states and Russia -- contribute to these frightening news developments.
[Representatives of the Russian military state that Russia's
militarization policy in the **Arctic** is a response to the buildup of
**NATO's active presence** in the region, claiming these
**developments** as an **hostile threat** to **national
security**]{.underline}. However, there is no smoke without fire.
[**Circumpolar states**, including NATO members, have witnessed Russia's
**growing militarization** of the region for **several
years**.]{.underline} [Concerns regarding Russian activity in the High
North have grown as a result of the country's aggressive and
unpredictable behavior, particularly after the invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. Provocative moves such as the recent test-launch
of a hypersonic Zircon cruise missile in the Barents Sea and the
nuclearisation of the Kola Peninsula are indeed alarming. The resulting
backlash, including the entry of Sweden and Finland into NATO, certainly
does not help in putting out the flames. To choose a strategy of
[**confrontation** **undermines** all existing and future **initiatives
for Arctic development**, **science**, and **environmental protection**.
Such an **irreversible turn** would have an irreparable negative impact

Partly in response to all this activity, the United States is rebuilding
its own military capabilities in the region, which have atrophied since
the end of the Cold War. Besides tracking Russian submarines near the
GIUK gap, Washington has stepped up its strategic air patrols off the
coast of Siberia to probe Russian defense systems and gather other
intelligence. The **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration also
[[plans to build]{.mark} a **fleet of [icebreakers]{.mark}** to **carry
out** what it has **referred** to as "**national** and **economic
security** **missions**"]{.underline} in the **[Arctic]{.underline}**.
[**Additional investments** will likely be necessary down
the]{.underline} line, both [[to police]{.mark} **[commercial
activities]{.mark}** along the **Alaskan coast** and throughout the U.S.
**exclusive economic zone**]{.underline} and to defend the country's
commitment to freedom of navigation in the polar region.

[[Neither side's actions are **necessarily**]{.underline}
**[aggressive]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in nature,]{.underline} nor do
they portend an impending geopolitical fight over who controls the
region. In fact, Russia's military buildup has taken place solely in
areas where its legal authority is undisputed. Submarine and aircraft
activity near the GIUK gap and off the Alaskan coast is a part of
Russia's global strategy to deter potential military attacks and not
focused on the Arctic per se. Much the same is true of U.S. actions in
and around the region.

[[At a time of **deepening distrust**]{.mark} between the United States
and Russia, however, the]{.underline} [danger is that [**even actions**
taken for **legitimate security** **reasons**]{.mark} [could
spark]{.mark} **[unnecessary geopolitical
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Hard-liners]{.mark}** in **both

competition]{.mark}**, and because the overall state of U.S.-Russian
relations is]{.underline} **[so dismal]{.underline}**, [they are
**gaining traction**]{.underline}. It is not difficult to imagine an
incident that would further reinforce their views. Russia, for example,
considers the Northern Sea Route to be within its territorial waters,
whereas the United States maintains that the passage is in international
waters. Should Washington insist on carrying out freedom-of-navigation
exercises there (as it did in May in the Barents Sea, at the western end
of the maritime route through Russian waters), [a [**standoff** with
**Russia**, even a **military clash**, **might
ensue.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

regarding future **developments**, and thus [created a **security

strategy paper of November 2020, Sweden identified a "new military
dynamic in the Arctic region."¹⁶⁴ Swedish Defence Minister Peter
Hultqvist explained that an "armed attack on Sweden \[...\] could not be
excluded," thereby justifying his country's military rearmament. From
2021 to 2025 defence spending will rise by 40 percent, and even by 85
percent compared to 2014 levels.¹⁶⁵ [[Amidst security dilemmas]{.mark},
[insecure countries]{.mark} typically [**react** by]{.mark} [feeling
**obliged** to **strengthen their military
capabilities**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [[This creates a **spiral
of**]{.mark} **[competition for power]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} ultimately
[leads to a **reduction**]{.mark}, **rather** than
**increase**,]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[security]{.mark}** of all
**involved actors**]{.underline}.¹⁶⁶ The US and other NATO members have
already given partial responses to the question of how to react to
Russia's increased engagement in the Arctic-North Atlantic region.
However, [the measures they have applied]{.underline} --
**[namely]{.underline}** rearmament, exercises, and
[redeployment]{.underline} [of]{.underline} operational
**[resources]{.underline}** -- must be embedded in a well-balanced
combination of deterrence, defence, and dialogue.

[[As **activities**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} **competition**
for **[access to]{.mark}** and **influence** in [the **Arctic
increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[so the need for]{.mark}
[mechanisms]{.mark} also grows [that]{.mark} can [overcome
tensions]{.mark}, maintain dialogue, [and **improve
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Without such a framework, ther[e is
a risk that a **misunderstanding** or **misperception**]{.mark}
[following an **accident** could **escalate** into an **unintended armed
conflict**]{.mark}. It is therefore essential for **Arctic countries**
to conduct a **dialogue** on **issues** of **military
security**.]{.underline} If this exchange is then institutionalised, it
is more likely that the intentions behind individual states' Arctic
security policy become more transparent. [Ideally, this would defuse the
security dilemma for all those involved, slow down the build-up of
military capacities, and create the foundations for a future security
architecture.]{.underline}

Arctic that together account for 45 percent of the country's production
capacity. An assessment by the Arctic Council in 2017 came to similar
conclusions. Sure enough, this June, a large storage tank filled with
diesel fuel collapsed after thawing permafrost caused its foundation to
sink. The accident caused an Exxon Valdez--sized oil spill that has
spread to the nearby Lake Pyasino and possibly the Pyasina River, which
flows into the Arctic Ocean.

continue to pursue a largely collaborative approach to nonproliferation,
the future of that collaboration **looks increasingly
questionable**]{.underline} for reasons having to do with internal
developments (especially in the United States) and larger global shifts.
[The international [community]{.mark} has done a decent job of
[preventing]{.mark} horizontal nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration.
This]{.underline} relative [success has [resulted
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the presence of legal, political, and
normative barriers in the Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) framework; the
United States' ability to make allies feel secure enough not to pursue
nuclear capabilities; and [the [sense]{.mark} that clandestine nuclear
[development will be caught]{.mark}---**largely [because the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia have]{.mark} historically
[been united]{.mark} in opposing nuclear weapons** programs of both
friendly and hostile regimes. That shared commitment, however, **appears
increasingly open to question.**]{.underline} Participants identified
several reasons why continued U.S.-Russian collaboration around
nonproliferation appears uncertain. These include Washington's mounting
estrangement from the international system and multilateral
agreements---a phenomenon that the Trump administration has accelerated
but not created. Views of the international order have become bogged
down in partisan politics in the United States, which makes it more
difficult for the United States to adopt positions enjoying bipartisan
consensus---and for other states to trust that U.S. commitments (such as
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran) will endure across
administrations. Increased U.S. insularity could also weaken the
effectiveness of U.S. sanctions and other coercive measures aimed at
countering proliferation, especially as steps by Russia and others to
bypass the U.S.-dominated global financial architecture continue.
[Growing [U.S.-Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} (and U.S.-China)
[[competition could]{.mark} **itself [jeopardize coop]{.mark}eration [on
nonprolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} as well. [The danger of
nonproliferation taking a backseat to other policy
objectives]{.underline} (as has already been the case with regard to
India and Pakistan) [could grow as Washington and Moscow come to **focus
more on great power competition.** Increasing competition]{.underline}
also [makes it more difficult for the United States and Russia to
negotiate new agreements related to arms control and nonproliferation
**at a time [when more states are challenging]{.mark} the strictures of
[the NPT]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Many states, including rising "middle
powers," believe the United States and Russia have not lived up to their
NPT commitments to reduce their own nuclear arsenals. Perception that
the current system is unjust will push more of these middle powers to
develop nuclear programs.

in less than two years. Unlike during the Cold War, when generations
lived under threat of a nuclear Armageddon, the two militaries are
barely on speaking terms. \"[During the Cold War, we understood each
other\'s signals. We talked]{.underline},\" says the top NATO commander
in Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is about to retire.
\"I\'m concerned that we don\'t know them as well today.\" Scaparrotti,
in his role as [Supreme Allied Commander
Europe](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/03/05/top-us-general-seeks-more-troops-warships-in-europe-to-counter-russia/),
has met only twice with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian
general staff, but has spoken to him by phone a number of other times.
\"I personally think [[communication is]{.mark} a very **[important part
of deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Scaparrotti said, referring to
the idea that adversaries who know each other\'s capabilities and
intentions are less likely to fall into conflict. \"So, I think [we
should have more communication [with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
[would ensure that we understand each other and why we are doing what
we\'re doing]{.underline}.\" He added: \"It doesn\'t have to be a lot.\"
The United States and Russia, which together control more than 90
percent of the world\'s nuclear weapons, say that in August they will
leave the 1987 treaty that banned an entire class of nuclear weapons.
And there appears to be little prospect of extending the 2010 New
[Start](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/04/14/the-chill-in-us-russia-relations-has-some-worried-about-stumbling-into-a-military-conflict/)
treaty that limits each side\'s strategic nuclear weapons. After a
period of post-Cold War cooperation on nuclear security and other
defense issues, [the relationship between Washington and Moscow took a
nosedive]{.underline}, particularly [after Russian forces entered the
former Soviet republic of Georgia]{.underline} in 2008. Tensions spiked
with Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and its [military
intervention in eastern
Ukraine](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/26/russias-conflict-with-ukraine-an-explainer/).
In response, Congress in 2016 severely limited military cooperation with
Russia. The law prohibits \"military-to-military cooperation\" until the
secretary of defense certifies that Russia \"has ceased its occupation
of Ukrainian territory\" and \"aggressive activities.\" The law was
amended last year to state that it does not limit military talks aimed
at \"reducing the risk of conflict.\" [Relations frayed even further
amid U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election]{.underline}, although President Donald Trump has
doubted Russian complicity in what U.S. intelligence agencies assert was
an effort by Moscow to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House.
After a [Helsinki summit with
Putin](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/07/18/trump-backs-down-under-fire-clarifies-on-russia-meddling/)
in July, Trump publicly accepted the Kremlin leader's denial of
interference. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said in an interview Friday that Russian behavior is to blame
for the strained relationship. \"It\'s very difficult for us to have
normal relationships with a country that has not behaved normally over
the last few years,\" Dunford said. \"There are [major [issues that
affect our bilateral relationship that have to be
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}, to include where Russia has violated
international laws, norms and standards.\" Dunford said he speaks
regularly with Gerasimov, his Russian counterpart, and the two sides
talk on other levels. \"I\'m [satisfied right now with our
[military-to-military communication]{.mark} to **[maintain a]{.mark}
degree of [transparency]{.mark}** [that **mitigates**]{.mark} **the risk
of [miscalculation]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" he said. \"I think we have
a framework within to manage a crisis, should one occur, at the senior
military-to-military level.\" James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral
who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013, says the
West must confront Russia where necessary, including on its
interventions in Ukraine and Syria. But he believes there room for
cooperation on multiple fronts, including [the
Arctic](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/04/04/with-missiles-pointing-out-to-sea-northern-clover-stakes-russian-claim-on-arctic-waters/)
and arms control. \"We are **[in danger of stumbling backward into a
Cold War that is to no one\'s advantage]{.underline}**,\" he said in an
[email](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/04/14/the-chill-in-us-russia-relations-has-some-worried-about-stumbling-into-a-military-conflict/)
exchange. \"Without steady, political-level engagement between the
defense establishments, the risk of a true new Cold War rises
steadily.\" No one is predicting a deliberate Russian act of war in
Europe, but [the decline in regular talks is a worry to
many.]{.underline} Moscow says it is ready to talk. \"[[**Russia remains
open** for]{.mark} interaction aimed at [de-escalating tension,
**restoring mutual trust**, **preventing any
misinterpretations**]{.mark} of one another\'s intentions, [and
**reducing**]{.mark} **the [risk of]{.mark} dangerous
[incidents]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said in a statement last week in response to NATO\'s 70th
anniversary celebration. Sam Nunn, who served in the Senate as a
Democrat from Georgia from 1972 to 1997, argues that dialogue with
Russia is too important to set aside, even if it carries domestic
political risk. \"You can\'t call time out,\" he said in an interview.
\"[The nuclear issues go on, and they\'re getting more
dangerous]{.underline}.\" Nunn co-wrote an opinion piece with former
Secretary of State George Shultz and former Defense Secretary William
Perry arguing that the [[U.S.]{.mark} and its allies [and Russia]{.mark}
are [caught in a \"policy incapacity]{.mark} ~~paralysis~~\" [that could
lead to]{.mark} a military confrontation and potentially the [first use
of nuclear weapons]{.mark} since the U.S. bombed Japan in August
1945.]{.underline} \"A bold policy shift is needed,\" they wrote in the
Wall Street Journal on Thursday, \"to support a strategic re-engagement
with Russia and walk back from this perilous precipice. Otherwise, our
nations may soon be entrenched in a nuclear standoff more precarious,
disorienting and economically costly than the Cold War.\" A group of
U.S., Canadian, European and Russian security experts and former
officials in February issued a call for talks with Russia on crisis
management. \"The [**[risks of mutual misunderstanding]{.mark}** and
**[unintended signals]{.mark} that stem [from]{.mark} an [absence of
dialogue]{.mark}** relating to crisis management]{.underline} \... are
real,\" the Euro-Atlantic Security Leadership Group said in a statement.
It said this [could lead to conventional war with Russia or, in a
worst-case scenario]{.underline}, "the **[potential for [nuclear
threats, or even nuclear use, where millions could be killed in
minutes]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

Russia\'s annexation of [**Crimea** and]{.underline} subsequent war in
eastern **[Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014 has [ignited]{.underline} a
fierce international [**debate** on]{.underline} how to view [Russia\'s
foreign policy. Much]{.underline} of the discussion [has focused on
[Russia\'s]{.mark} alleged ['**revisionist
position**']{.mark}]{.underline} towards the present international
system, which Russia considers too Western dominated, and Russia\'s
supposed 'assertiveness' or 'aggressiveness' (Bartles & McDermott, 2014;
Illarionov, 2014; Kasparov, 2015; Piontkovsky, 2015). [Some]{.underline}
scholars [point out that]{.underline} the annexation of [Crimea
and]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine is a '**game
changer**']{.underline}, arguing that the West must re-assess its threat
perception and change its policy vis-à-vis Russia in a more firm
direction (Center for Militære Studier, 2014; House of Commons Defence
Committee, 2014). Other scholars argue that what we are experiencing is
a New Cold War between Russia and the West (Legvold, 2014; Lucas, 2015).
Part of this debate has focused on Russia\'s alleged breaking or bending
of international rules and concepts (Allison, 2014; Kupfer & Waal, 2015;
Lamont, 2014). Others argue that what we see is a 'resumption of
great-power rivalry' (Trenin, 2014), a 'return of geopolitics' (Kotkin,
2016; Mead, 2014; Mearsheimer, 2014). [The debate is further influenced
by the war in **Syria**, where Russia is described as establishing
itself as 'a player']{.underline} in the Syrian crisis or as a 'key
regional player' (Kozhanov, 2015) in the wider Middle East. A move from
Putin that once again has caught Washington 'off-guard' and essentially
forces the USA and the West 'to get real' about Russia and forego any
plans of another 'reset' (Stent, 2016). [Another general
argument]{.underline} in the debate [has been to highlight a **supposed
trend** towards a **narrowing** of the circle]{.underline} of people
[around Putin]{.underline} to mere yes-men, ridding him of critical
advice (Galeotti & Judah, 2014; Judah, 2014). Other scholars highlight
that 'the chaotic manner in which the operation in Crimea unfolded
belies any concerted plan for territorial revanche' as a sign of 'a
leader who is increasingly prone to risky gambles and to grabbing
short-run tactical advantages' (Treisman, 2016, p. 48), and who 'is
about immediate tactics, not long-term strategy' (Marten, 2015, p. 191).
[The impression left]{.underline} from these most valid accounts [is a
Russia that **must be confronted** and **balanced** because of its
**assertive**, **aggressive** and **revisionist** stand. A country which
one **cannot cooperate** with but must **balance**]{.underline} because
of its rule-changing and destabilising behaviour. [And a Russian leader
who is **short sighted**, **unpredictable** and **gambling** with the
future of his country]{.underline}, who takes all of the important
decisions on foreign policy on his own without consulting more than a
handful of trusted advisors and friends.

[But [if one takes a]{.mark} **closer [look]{.mark}** [at]{.mark}
Russia\'s policy vis-à-vis [the **Arctic**, Russia **does not
look**]{.mark} **like a [revisionist]{.mark} power**. [It looks]{.mark}
more [like a **s**]{.mark}**tatus [quo power]{.mark}**
[following]{.mark} a **well-[established]{.mark} long-term
[strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [[Russia]{.mark} has
**[followed]{.mark}** the '[rules]{.mark} of the game' in the **Arctic**
-- while]{.underline} all the time ['**breaking** the rules of the game'
in **Ukraine**. Russia has been [a]{.mark} **constructive
[supporter]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark} Arctic [Council and]{.mark} the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and it has **strictly [followed]{.mark}**
the process of [delineation of]{.mark} the undersea
[territory]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic [[under]{.mark} the
auspices of]{.underline} the United Nations Convention of the Law of the
Sea (**[[UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}**) -- of which it (the Soviet
Union) has been a signatory member since 1982 -- [and **met deadlines**
and **requirements** of]{.underline} the UN Committee on the Limits of
the Continental Shelf (**[[CLCS]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [[It **has
not**]{.mark} **bullied** or **[threatened]{.mark}** its
[neighbours]{.mark} and fellow members of the Arctic Council. **How can
this be explained** if Russia\'s behaviour is increasingly
confrontational, rule breaking and assertive?]{.underline} Is it just a
matter of time -- a period of 'quite before the storm' -- until Russia
is strong enough to use its steady growing military power in the Arctic
for breaking rules and making territorial gains in that area as well? Or
is Russia actually engaging in a rule-governed behaviour that is
non-assertive and non-revisionist, at least in the Arctic? And what
implications, if any, might this have on other policy areas? Are there
other areas where we might cooperate rather than confront Russia?

In explaining the lack of spillover from the war in Ukraine so far some
scholars underline the effects of international organisations and
regimes in the Arctic (Ikonen, 2015). Some are more sceptical of what
the future brings and suggests establishing new, or enhanced,
institutions in the Arctic, especially concerning security issues
(Conley & Rohloff, 2015). Others focus on structural factors and point
to the lack of conflicting national interests between the Arctic coastal
states in explaining the apparent lack of spillover from the war in
Ukraine and point to the mutual coexistence of 'moderate military
build-up combined with enhanced diplomatic accommodation' in the Arctic
(Kristensen & Sakstrup, 2016). Some scholars are sceptical of the
alleged acceleration of Russia\'s military and security posture in the
Arctic (Zysk, 2015), others downplay its importance (Konyshev &
Sergunin, 2014). Somewhat [**less studied** are the **[domestic
pressures]{.mark}** that [form]{.mark}]{.underline} parts of the
[[Russian Arctic policy]{.mark}, and]{.underline} in most cases
[scholars focus on **materialistic** rather than **idealistic**
factors]{.underline} (Berzina, 2015; Laruelle, 2011, 2012, 2014a). This
paper will contribute to discussions on the idealist (or discursive)
side of the domestic factors which form foreign policy. Thus, the essay
seeks to study Russia\'s own debate on the Arctic in order to draw the
boundaries or the frame of future Russian policies vis-à-vis the Arctic
that are logically possible and politically plausible.

We will address two general hypotheses. First, [Russia\'s
decision-making process concerning Arctic affairs is to a large extent
**exempt** from]{.underline} the general centralisation of
decision-making that seems to have hit [other policy areas, such
as]{.underline} the decision to invade **[Ukraine]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, [the decision-making process is **institutionalised** and
seems to be **less dependent** on personal links]{.underline}. Second,
[Russia\'s]{.underline} public [debate on the Arctic is]{.underline}
mainly **[divided]{.underline}** in two overall discourses. These
discourses are based on the basic assumptions of -- or at least
assumptions that are very similar to -- the two theoretical schools of
thought within international relations (IR), namely:
IR-realism/geopolitics and IR-liberalism. Whether behind these two ways
of discussing Russia\'s policy in the Arctic (and the world) there are
underlying forms of discourse is outside the scope of this article. The
discourses could be considered to be close to the centuries-old debate
about Russia\'s relationship with the West, above all the debate between
Zapadniki (Westernisers) and Slavophiles (see, for example, Neumann
1996). On one side, there is IR-realism/geopolitics inspired discourse,
which at times is strongly patriotic and partially coloured by national
romantic rhetoric. Within the concept of IR-realism here we include both
neorealism and realism (also called classic realism), understood as the
two schools within international political theory that are characterised
by (among others) the theorists Kenneth Waltz (neorealism) and Henry
Morgenthau (realism) (see Morgenthau 1948; Waltz 1979). The concept of
geopolitics is based upon the views of, for example, Mackinder (1904)
and Russian geopoliticians such as Alexander Dugin and Alexander
Prokhanov, who are, to a large extent, inspired by the pre-war German
geopolitical traditions of Karl Haushofer, Carl Schmitt and Rudolf
Kjellén. This discourse focuses on the need for a security-based,
unilateralist approach to the Arctic. It is based on balance of power
logic (zero-sum game) and parts of it are permeated with notions such as
'conquest', 'exploring', 'Russia\'s greatness', 'revival' and
'sovereignty'. On the other side, there is an IR-liberalism discourse,
which aspires to accommodate international law, first and foremost the
UNCLOS framework and the CLCS process. The term IR-liberalism includes
liberalism, idealism or utopianism (the latter term is used mainly by
critics), as well as more modern movements such as liberal
institutionalism (see Jackson & Sørensen, 2007; Wæver, 1992). Here the
emphasis is on institutionalism, regimes and economic development,
rather than democracy and democratic peace theory. The proponents of
this discourse view IR generally and policies in the Arctic region
especially as a plus-sum game, where all actors -- and especially Russia
-- stand to gain more from cooperation and peaceful competition than
from unilateralist action and balance of power dynamics. Here the
language used is far more technocratic, legalistic or mercantile, with
an emphasis on terms such as 'scientific' and 'research'. There are a
number of references to international law, such as UNCLOS and especially
the CLCS process, as well as a number of joint effort and cooperative
expressions, for example, 'joint venture', 'public--private
partnerships', 'cooperation' and 'productive cooperation'.

[Accurate threat assessment is **vital** to the formulation of foreign
policy]{.underline}. Across centuries of political and technological
change, the giants of strategy---from Sun-tzu and Thucydides to Carl von
Clausewitz and George Kennan---warned against exaggerating threats and
ignoring their geopolitical context. Still, **[ideologically driven
[threat inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}**---from a phantom Vietnamese
attack in the Gulf of Tonkin to nonexistent Iraqi nuclear and chemical
weapons---[has **repeatedly** [led the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[into]{.mark} **costly
[quagmires]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite this history, [the country is
again on the brink of an **ideologically driven
blunder**]{.underline}---this time [[in the]{.mark}
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[For **over a decade**, defense [hawks]{.mark} have been
[sound]{.mark}ing an [alarm over Russia's]{.mark} **supposed military
[superiority]{.mark}** and **incipient aggression** in the
region]{.underline}. [Previous U.S. presidents **resisted the bait**,
avoiding confrontation and embracing cooperation through
the]{.underline} multinational **[Arctic Council]{.underline}**
established after the end of the Cold War. [They knew that Russia's
[forces]{.mark} in the region [were **defensive**]{.mark}**ly
structured** [and **weaker**]{.mark} than they were before the Soviet
collapse in 1991, despite efforts to rebuild them]{.underline} that
began in the mid-2000s. Previous U.S. presidents also knew that U.S. and
NATO forces had the clear upper hand in the Arctic and that [predictions
of Russian aggression were mainly **threat-mongering** by armchair
analysts and vested political interests]{.underline}.

[But]{.underline} the administration of U.S. President Donald
[[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline} recently **[[embraced]{.mark} Arctic
[alarmism]{.mark}]{.underline}** with a vengeance. [It has stoked fears
of Russian and Chinese "**aggression**," **trashed** the Arctic
Council's delicate diplomacy, and adopted a **new confrontational
posture**]{.underline}. In so doing, [it joins the alarmists
in]{.underline} three serious mistakes: [the failure to **assess
specific threats accurately**, the failure to consider an adversary's
forces in **relation** to those of the United States and its allies, and
the failure to evaluate the **broader strategic
landscape**]{.underline}---the political, economic, and environmental
factors beyond the battlefield. Violation of these three pillars of
careful threat assessment is [drawing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [toward]{.underline} an **[unnecessary
confrontation]{.underline}** in a region where the real enemy isn't Cold
War ghosts but looming environmental disaster.

THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCURACY

[A staple of the new Arctic alarmism is [the "**icebreaker
gap**"]{.mark}---the notion that Russia's large fleet of icebreaking
vessels poses a threat of naval aggression]{.underline}. Alarmists
invoke [the term]{.underline} seemingly unaware that it [[echoes]{.mark}
the so-called **bomber** and **missile gaps** of the 1950s and
1960s---**[false claims]{.mark}** of Soviet nuclear superiority that
justified an **expensive** and **precarious** nuclear arms
race]{.underline}. In fact, [[Russia's]{.mark} icebreaker [fleet
performs]{.mark} **overwhelmingly [civilian
missions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And [given that [Russia has **ten
times** as much]{.mark} Arctic [coastline]{.mark} as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[and is]{.mark} roughly [**50
times** as]{.mark} economically [dependent on the region]{.mark}, it
would be **strange indeed** if Russia's icebreaker fleet were **not**
far larger than the U.S. fleet]{.underline}.

[Handwringing over the icebreaker gap also suggests a **lack of
understanding** about what these vessels actually do. Russia's
icebreakers perform]{.underline} the same **[coast guard
functions]{.underline}** as Canadian, Norwegian, and U.S. ships:
[search-and-rescue missions, antismuggling operations, oil-spill
responses, and supply deliveries for research stations and remote
coastal communities. They also escort cargo vessels]{.underline} across
the ice-choked Northern Sea Route that links Europe and Asia. [Some
Russian icebreakers do seasonally escort naval vessels into or out of
port]{.underline} through treacherous icy waters, [but [this
reflects]{.mark} a **[weakness]{.mark}**, not a strength. Three of the
[Russia]{.mark}n navy's fleets]{.underline}---the Baltic, Black Sea, and
Pacific fleets---[can [access the high seas only via narrow "**choke
points**"]{.mark} where enemies **closely track them**. The]{.underline}
fourth, Russia's [Northern Fleet]{.underline}, [faces the additional
burden of enduring a brutal]{.underline}, months-long [Arctic winter
during which Russian ships can pick their way to safer seas only in the
wake of a plodding icebreaker. U.S. warships face **no such
challenges**]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, [some Arctic alarmists advocate the creation of a
**large** and even **nuclear-powered** U.S. icebreaker
fleet]{.underline} that could escort U.S. Navy warships into combat on
the polar icecap. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, has argued
that "the highways of the Arctic are paved by icebreakers. . . . Russia
has superhighways, and we have dirt roads." [Claims like this reveal
**ignorance** of how icebreakers actually function]{.underline}.
Churning through pack ice more than three feet thick, [an icebreaker
leaves a narrow path choked with jagged floes]{.underline} (one cubic
meter of ice weighs nearly 2,000 pounds). [[The]{.mark} steel plating of
a U.S. [Navy]{.mark} destroyer is **less than one-half-inch
thick**]{.underline}. Even a polar-rated cargo ship has a more
ice-resistant hull. [If a destroyer treats this ice-clogged channel as a
superhighway, it [runs the risk of a]{.mark} **deadly
[collision]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [ships are limited to the
speed of their escorts]{.underline}, which plow through three to six
feet of ice at under ten nautical miles per hour, even in good weather.
In severe weather---fierce winds and powerful waves that encase the
ship's deck and superstructure in ice---progress slows to a crawl. [The
United States' fast, stealthy, thin-hulled warships would become
**sitting ducks**]{.underline}.

[Some Arctic hawks tout [Russia]{.mark}'s so-called combat icebreaker as
a **unique threat**]{.underline}---a ship "built specifically for Arctic
fighting." [But the]{.underline} recently launched Ivan [Papanin
**hardly represents**]{.underline} an **[escalation]{.underline}** in
the Arctic arms race [since it [was modeled on]{.mark} **existing [NATO
vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline} [such]{.mark} as Norway's Svalbard, in
service since 2002[. It also resembles]{.underline} the
**[Danish]{.underline}** Knud Rasmussen--class [ships]{.underline} that
have been deployed since 2008. [Other similar]{.underline} offshore
patrol [vessels include **Finland's**]{.underline} Pohjanmaa-class [and
**Canada's**]{.underline} Harry DeWolf--class ships. [All]{.underline}
are roughly 300 feet long, cruise at 20 knots, can break three feet of
ice, and [carry]{.underline} multiple [weapons]{.underline}. [All are
also designed for Coast Guard--type]{.underline} patrol and
search-and-rescue [missions, as well as possible armed
conflict]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} Ivan [Papanin]{.underline} is
Russia's first in this category and [differs mainly in that [it
is]{.mark} **still [not operational]{.mark}**. Behind schedule and
already outnumbered, it **hardly lives up** to its billing]{.underline}
by one analyst [as]{.underline} "[Russia's Trump Card]{.underline} in
the Battle for the Arctic."

BALANCE OF FORCES

If [fears]{.underline} of an icebreaker gap stem in part from an
exaggeration [of Russian [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, they [also
reflect a failure to evaluate such capabilities in **relation** to U.S.
and allied forces. The mere number of Russian ships or planes **[means
little]{.mark} in isolation**. What counts is how those forces **stack
up** against their potential opponents]{.underline}. Throughout the Cold
War, [[U.S. assessments]{.mark} not only **[exaggerated the]{.mark}
total [number]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Soviet bombers and missiles [but
[also]{.mark} often **[ignored]{.mark}** the United States'
[countervailing forces---which were]{.mark} nearly always
**[more]{.mark} accurate**, **reliable**, and **technologically
[advanced]{.mark}**. In today's Arctic, alarmists highlight
[Russia']{.mark}s assets while **omitting similar scrutiny** of U.S. and
NATO forces]{.underline}. For example, alarmists note that Russia's
Arctic-based Northern Fleet is its navy's largest. But [the entire
Northern [Fleet]{.mark} still [has **fewer than 40**]{.mark} surface
ships---half of which date to the Cold War]{.underline}. Now, [subtract
smaller coastal-patrol craft and what remains are **barely a dozen**
major combatants. A **host of problems** from faulty turbines to
obsolete air-defense systems have delayed newer Russian ships from
entering service. The same problems plague Russia's submarine fleet,
which is **consistently outclassed** by the U.S. Navy's
modern]{.underline} torpedo and cruise-missile-firing attack
[submarines]{.underline}.

By contrast, the recent Trident Juncture exercise brought 65 U.S. and
NATO ships to the Arctic and involved the first transit of a U.S.
aircraft carrier across the Arctic Circle since 1991. In a crisis, NATO
could surge far more naval power to the region, vastly outmatching the
Russians. This power includes ballistic missile subs recently adapted to
launch cruise missiles and deploy special forces. [Despite U.S. fears of
Russian submarines infiltrating Scandinavian waters, it is the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [that now has greater
sub-based land-attack capabilities]{.underline}.

[A **similar mismatch exists** when it comes to Arctic air power.
Alarmists hype the threat posed by]{.underline} some dozen
[["**airbases**"]{.underline}]{.mark} that Russia has built or reopened
after 20 years of abandonment. [But these outposts are better described
as **airstrips**]{.underline}. Manned by small crews, [none of them is
capable of hosting **even a single squadron** of fighter
jets]{.underline}. Instead, [they mainly support antiair and antiship
batteries---early-warning radars and short-range missiles designed to
**[defend]{.mark}** approaches to [Russian territory]{.mark}. Russian
fighter [jets]{.mark}]{.underline} still deploy from the same distant
mainland bases that they did 30 years ago and, due to a modest in-air
refueling capability, [[have a **limited**]{.mark} **combat
[radius]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a result, [the Russian air force
offers a **formidable defense** against any intruder, but it is neither
**structured** nor **based** for major offensive
operations]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, the United States and NATO can summon several hundred stealth
F-22 and F-35 fighters for long-range Arctic missions.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its part, [still [has **no**]{.mark}
**stealth fighters** with similar [ability to penetrate air
defenses]{.mark}. Both in the air and at sea, it is the United States
and its [allies]{.mark} that [possess]{.mark} the **[greater Arctic
power-projection]{.mark} capability**]{.underline}.

STRATEGIC CONTEXT

[Cold War era [threat inflation was driven by]{.mark} a [belief in
a]{.mark} **relentless [Kremlin]{.mark} strategy for world
[domination]{.mark}**[. The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**discounted
evidence** tha]{.mark}t]{.underline} by the 1970s, [the Soviet
[leadership had grown]{.mark} **deeply [conservative]{.mark}**---afraid
of U.S. military and technological might, seeking **not to advance** but
merely to **shore up** its tottering global positions---in favor of
**dire assessments** of Soviet readiness to launch a major
war]{.underline}. Today, [the belief in]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [**Putin's unrelenting hostility** fuels an **exaggeration** of
Russia's strength and aggressive design]{.underline}.

[Alarmists **consistently shade facts** to fit this narrative: Russian
bombers intercepted by NATO fighters]{.underline} near Alaskan or
Norwegian airspace [are practicing **bombing runs**, while U.S. bombers
intercepted by Russian fighters]{.underline} close to Russian airspace
in the Baltic or Black Seas [are on "**training missions**." Russian
amphibious exercises in the Arctic are **offensive**, but similar
U.S.-NATO maneuvers are **defensive**. Some even see a Russian attack on
the Baltics or Norway---**virtually inconceivable**, as it would bring
swift]{.underline} military as well as political and economic
[ruin---as]{.underline} a **[realistic]{.underline}** possibility. [Such
[exaggeration]{.mark} in turn **[fuels]{.mark} the cycle** of
[buildup]{.mark} and counterbuildup]{.underline}.

[[A]{.mark} more [realistic approach]{.mark}]{.underline} to assessing
Russia's Arctic policy [**does not ignore** Russia's recent military
buildup but]{.underline} places it in context. That [means]{.underline},
first of all, [acknowledging that the balance of forces still **strongly
favors** the West. This]{.underline} approach [also [recognizes]{.mark}
**25 [years of]{.mark} Russian [coop]{.mark}eration** in the Arctic,
[including]{.mark} Moscow's [**constructive role** on the Arctic
Council]{.mark} and **fealty** to the principle that territorial
disputes can be settled only through the UN Law of the Sea
process]{.underline}. (The only Arctic nation that has not acceded to
the Law of the Sea is the United States.) Above all, [[realists
appreciate Russia's **emotional** and **economic stake**]{.mark} as an
Arctic nation and understand that bluster aimed at a domestic audience
reflects not **strength** but **insecurity**]{.underline}.

COLD WAR REDUX

[Arctic alarmism]{.underline} began over a decade ago with fears of a
Russian "grab" for the North Pole's undersea riches. Today, that alarm
[has shifted to fears of Russia's ability to **push NATO out** of the
region. [Russia's]{.mark} coastal [defenses are
described]{.mark}]{.underline} in think tank analyses
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} "core components of [an **[anti-access/area
denial]{.mark} bubble**]{.underline}" [while their naval deployments
pose "a **direct challenge** to]{.underline} transatlantic sea lines of
communication that are essential to [Allied reinforcement of
Europe]{.underline} in the event of any major conflict." [This is **Cold
War--style threat inflation**, as [Russia's]{.mark} air-defense radars
and [missiles]{.mark} simply [**do not approach** such
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The possibility of Russia]{.mark}'s
tiny fleet [charging into]{.mark} the North Atlantic to attack
[NATO]{.mark} reinforcements during a major war [is
**suicidal**]{.mark}**ly**, **apocalyptically remote**]{.underline}.

[[A **more realistic concern** is]{.mark} not that [Russia]{.mark} will
**gain** complete dominance but that NATO will **lose** it. Moscow's
modest buildup could **threaten NATO's ability** to keep the Russian
navy contained in its home Arctic waters and block it from transiting
the]{.underline}
[G]{.underline}reenland-[I]{.underline}celand-[U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom [Gap]{.underline}. [NATO has historically
controlled this choke point]{.underline}, allowing it to project power
freely in those waters. Now, [Russia has begun **[pushing
back]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like China in its coastal waters---though
less aggressively---[Russia is]{.underline} essentially [saying, "Your
air force will not dominate our skies without **challenge**, nor will
your]{.underline} carriers and cruise-missile-firing [submarines
approach our shores with **impunity**." [The **real**]{.mark}
**strategic [choice]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} whether to seek an
**[accommodation]{.mark}** that permits some measure of mutual security
[or]{.mark} to insist on continued U.S.-NATO dominance and [risk
**escalating**]{.mark} **Arctic [confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Russia Deterrence Turn\-\--2AC

#### Arctic deterrence is failing now. Building new icebreakers is key to deter Russia.

Roger **Wicker 22**. US Senator. \"To Deter Arctic Aggression, Build the
Polar Fleet We Need.\" RealClearDefense. 10-27-2022.
https://www.realcleardefense.com/2022/10/27/to_deter_arctic_aggression_build_the_polar_fleet_we_need_861459.html

Winter is coming early this year in the Arctic. Last month, a Chinese
and Russian joint surface action group came within 75 nautical miles of
Kiska Island, Alaska. In response, the Coast Guard mobilized a patrol to
monitor the ships as they approached American home waters. A year prior,
several Chinese warships had entered the U.S. exclusive economic zone
off Alaska.

[These **repeated tests** of **American resolve** so close to our
**shores** should **set off alarm** **bells** in
**Washington**]{.underline}. Our two greatest adversaries, **[China and
Russia]{.underline}**, [are now cooperating on the **high seas** to
**challenge** our **presence** in the **region**.]{.underline}

[Chinese and Russian attempts to gain superiority in the Arctic are not
new]{.underline}. In 2015, five Chinese vessels marked President Barack
Obama's visit to the Bering Sea with battle drills off the Alaskan
coast. [Russia has long maintained a strong military presence in the
**Arctic**, even after the **end** of the **Cold War**.]{.underline}

[What is different now, however, is that [our **rivals' power
projection**]{.mark} in the polar regions [is **outpacing our
own**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a self-described "near-Arctic power,"
China has been working to build a "Polar Silk Road" of economic and
military infrastructure across the Arctic. Meanwhile, [[**Russia** is
developing]{.mark} its **already-[formidable capabilities]{.mark}** [to
disrupt freedom of **navigation** and **U.S.
operations.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[If China and Russia reach their goals, [the Arctic will emerge as a
central theater in our]{.mark} [**respective**
**competitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Alaska]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[vital]{.underline}]{.mark} location [[for
monitoring]{.mark} Chinese and [Russian]{.mark} **[missile
forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [Arctic's]{.mark} natural
characteristics also make it [ripe for **space**]{.mark}
**[launch]{.mark}**, **[reconnaissance]{.mark}**, and energy resource
capture]{.underline}. [Losing **the upper hand** in the]{.underline}
[Arctic could result in our **exclusion** from the **region militarily**
and economically]{.underline} --- an ominous prospect, given the
trajectory of American relations with Russia and China.

The United States has already been caught flat-footed, as we have
invested relatively little in our Arctic forces. For example, [[the
combined **icebreaker fleets**]{.mark} of our [adversaries **outpace**
ours by more than]{.mark} **[25 to 1.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[U.S. leaders simply have not met the Arctic challenge,]{.underline} and
we are only beginning to confront this reality now. In recent months,
the Biden Administration has created new posts at the Pentagon and State
Department to address Arctic security. And more recently, the White
House rolled out a comprehensive political-military strategy for the
Arctic, which includes a call for a greater military presence in the
region.

[Our core challenge, however, is that the U.S. defense industrial base
will essentially be starting from scratch to field these
capabilities]{.underline}. Decades of low investment in icebreakers from
the federal government has left U.S. shipbuilders unprepared to service
even the best defense strategy. Today, only one shipyard in the United
States is building polar icebreakers, and we are set to add just three
of these crucial ships by 2030. [[Without **sustained investment** in
these **capabilities**]{.mark}, [there is little hope of maintaining
**long-term U.S. power** in the **region**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Congress has worked to authorize funding for a twelfth national security
cutter in this year's defense bill, but much more needs to be done. [[We
need to **expand** the **icebreaker program**]{.mark} and substantially
increase the budget for U.S. Northern Command]{.underline}, which would
give planners the tools they need to navigate this unstable strategic
environment.

Russia and China's latest target, Kiska Island, became known during
World War II as one of few U.S. territories ever to be occupied by a
foreign nation. Japanese control of the island came to an end in 1943
when Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and his cruisers expelled the Japanese.
Since then, U.S. forces have continued a proud tradition of Arctic
operations, including the first deployment of a nuclear submarine in
1954.

It appears Kiska --- and indeed the United States --- is once again
coming under threat from a Pacific power. [[The **moment** demands that
we **unleash the full might** of our **defense industrial base**
to]{.mark} [**secure our foothold** in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [As the proverbial winter with

### \-\--Expansionism Impact\-\--2AC

#### Giving in to Russian expansionism guarantees [nuclear war]{.underline} and [wildfire proliferation]{.underline} globally. 

Dr. Stephen R. **Shalom 22**. PhD in Political Science from Boston
University, professor of political science at William Paterson
University, \"Ukraine and the Dangers of Nuclear War\",
<https://newpol.org/ukraine-and-the-dangers-of-nuclear-war/>

Returning to the initial question, [should the peace movement demand
that the United States and NATO stop arming Ukraine so as to avoid
provoking Russia]{.underline}? Sometimes it makes sense to give in to an
unjust aggressor if the consequences of not doing so are potential
extermination. If a villain points a gun at our heads and demands we
drop our weapons, we reluctantly do so.

Of course, **[Putin]{.underline}** -- unlike the hypothetical villain
--- [knows that it is not just his adversary who]{.underline} [will
suffer the consequences if he **pulls the trigger**]{.underline}. In
June 2021, Putin joined Biden in reaffirming "the principle that a
nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought." But might Putin be
crazy enough to start a nuclear war that would destroy Russia too? And
does that mean that even the remote chance of nuclear war requires us to
accede to Putin's demands to stop arming Ukraine or imposing sanctions?

[The problem with [succumbing to Putin's demands is]{.mark} that **doing
so** is **[not]{.mark}** necessarily [the best way to]{.mark}
**[minimize]{.mark}** the **dangers of [nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because a rational leader would not
undertake a policy whose costs outweighed the benefits, sometimes
leaders bluff, feigning that they are willing to face costs far greater
than warranted in order to intimidate their adversaries into surrender.
**[Surrender]{.underline}** here, however, [can **increase** the
**prospects** of **nuclear war going forward.**]{.underline}

One of the foremost advocates of this nuclear bluffing strategy was
Richard Nixon. As he explained his approach to his White House chief of
staff H. R. Haldeman, I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North
Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything
to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, 'for God's sake,
you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when
he's angry --- and he has his hand on the nuclear button' and Ho Chi
Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Nixon and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger tried to carry
out this strategy in October 1969, hoping to frighten the Soviet Union
into pressing North Vietnam to accept American terms. On October 6,
Kissinger ordered the secretary of defense to conduct a "series of
increased alert measures designed to convey to the Soviets an increasing
readiness by U.S. strategic forces." The next week, the Strategic Air
Command put on alert 176 bombers and 189 refueling tankers. Nixon met
with the Soviet ambassador, displaying, according to an impressed
Kissinger, the "guts of a riverboat gambler." On October 26, the
Strategic Air Command flew six armed B-52 bombers over Alaska. But,
despite the intimidation, Moscow did not compel Hanoi to surrender --
and (fortunately) nor did Soviet leaders panic and launch a preemptive
strike on the United States.

The political science literature shows that the madman strategy
generally doesn't work. The biggest problem with the strategy is, in the
words of Stephen Walt, an advocate of realism in international
relations:

> When other states deal with a powerful but unpredictable leader, they
> may tread carefully but they aren't going to make big concessions.
> After all, if a madman is dangerous now, doing anything that makes
> them more powerful just makes them more dangerous later. [Appeasement
> is sometimes a smart diplomatic strategy, but only if one believes
> that making concessions will **remove grievances**, reduce
> **suspicions**, make the other side more **benign**, and allow
> mutually beneficial relations to emerge]{.underline}.

Imagine what would happen if Washington responded to Putin's nuclear
bluster by stopping its weapons supplies to Ukraine or lifting its
sanctions.

The Kremlin, now with a proven method of getting its way, could then
demand surrender from Georgia and Moldova, two former Soviet republics
where Russian troops currently hold contested territory. And when the
United States and NATO refused to provide arms to these governments
(because, after all, one doesn't want to risk nuclear war), the two
countries would have little option but to submit. But why stop there? If
Russia then demanded (with appropriate rhetoric and missile tests) that
NATO troops be removed from the Baltic states, would it be worth risking
madman Putin escalating to nuclear war? So best comply. And if it then
further demanded that no NATO arms be provided to these former
components of the Soviet Union, again, why provoke the Bear? But [at
some point]{.underline}, [either Moscow or Washington will
miscalculate]{.underline} -- [will NATO back down? is Russia
bluffing]{.underline}? --- [and we'll be in the **midst** of a **nuclear
war.**]{.underline}

And Putin wouldn't be the only one to try to take advantage of this
strategy. [Would **[his success]{.mark}** [encourage other nuclear
bullies]{.mark}]{.underline}? [Might **[Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline}
then [make **demands** of Iran, to which Tehran would have to give in
lest it **face** **Armageddon**]{.underline}? [Might **[China]{.mark}**
demand that the United States stop]{.underline} [arming]{.underline} and
even trading with **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, [facilitating a bloodless
conquest?]{.underline} [Might **[North Korea]{.mark}** demand that South
Korea and Japan subsidize its economy?]{.underline}

But [[giving in]{.mark} to Putin's threats wouldn't only encourage
**continuing acts of nuclear extortion**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}
[[would]{.mark} also **[provoke]{.mark}** the potential [victims]{.mark}
of this **extortion** [to rush to **acquire** **nuclear arms**]{.mark}
of their own as a means of self-protection]{.underline}. [**[South
Korea]{.underline}**, **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[Japan]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[UAE]{.underline}**, **[Qatar]{.underline}**, **[Egypt]{.underline}**,
[[and others]{.mark} [would]{.mark} **inevitably** [**seek**]{.mark} to
become **nuclear weapons states**]{.underline} (if they are not already
doing so). Some experts have claimed that widespread nuclear
proliferation would be great, because no one would ever go to war again,
fearing nuclear retaliation. But as most analysts understand, **[[the
risks of accidental]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[inadvertent]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}
**[escalatory]{.underline}** [[war]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[or]{.underline} **[terrorism]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [or]{.underline}
**[sabotage]{.underline}** [[increases **exponentially**]{.mark} with
the number of **nuclear weapons states.**]{.underline}

To be sure, [the historical record suggests that nuclear arms have not
been very successful as a coercive tool]{.underline}. (Consider that
possession of nuclear weapons didn't allow the United States to prevail
in Vietnam or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.) But if nuclear threats
gave the Russians a victory in Ukraine (for that's what a cut-off of
Western military supplies would mean), the calculus would change
dramatically. Nuclear weapons expert Todd Sechser has observed:

> Russia has given us a vivid reminder that [nuclear weapons are not a
> magic wand]{.underline}. As the war began, Vladimir
> [Putin]{.underline} made several nuclear threats -- both explicit and
> implied. But [the fear of nuclear escalation has not **intimidated**
> **Ukraine** into **submission**]{.underline}. [Nor have these

> Ukraine]{.underline}. If anything, Putin's nuclear bellicosity has

> thrown a spotlight on the political limits of nuclear weapons, and
> dictators with nuclear ambitions should take note.

If instead, NATO had given in or gives in to Putin's demands, the
lessons for leaders with nuclear ambitions would be rather different.

**[Appeasement]{.underline}**, then, [has its dangers]{.underline},
[setting off dynamics that might **increase** rather than]{.underline}
**[decrease]{.underline}** **[the risks of nuclear war]{.underline}**.
But military build-up and the logic of deterrence have their dangers as
well, as we know from many historical examples. International relations
scholars and peace researchers has long identified the "security
dilemma" as a major cause of war: when one country takes steps to
increase its own security that in turn decrease the security of its
adversaries, the resulting countermoves end up reducing everyone's
security. (The eastward expansion of NATO was a classic example of this
dynamic.) So [while it would make good **sense** to call for the
**scal**ing **back** of **aid** to Ukraine if there were a **real
danger** of nuclear war]{.underline}, [**[giving in to Russian
demands]{.mark}** if [they were a **bluff**]{.mark}
**[might]{.mark}**]{.underline} actually [**[increase]{.mark}** [the
dangers of]{.mark} **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

AZRF = Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation

**[[Deterring Russia's aggressive posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In the European High North, the protection of the AZRF and NSR is
achieved through the Soviet-inherited Bastion defense concept. Bastion
is a multi-domain, multilayered "protective dome" of air defense, sea
denial, coastal defense systems, and domain awareness capabilities
located along critical choke points of the AZRF.79 It aims to heavily
deny adversary military operations and degrade the operating environment
at sea, in the air, and in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Bastion is designed to ensure the safety and survivability of the
sea-based, second-strike nuclear deterrent deployed with the Northern
Fleet on the Kola Peninsula as well as on the Kamchatka Peninsula with
the Pacific Fleet. A major concern is also the protection of the
air-based nuclear deterrent that can be deployed throughout the network
of bases across the AZRF, critical energy infrastructure on the Yamal
Peninsula and beyond, as well as the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the
Arkhangelsk Oblast.

Beyond the AZRF, [[**Russia** is seeking to extend **interdiction
capabilities**]{.mark} away from the Arctic itself]{.underline} and
deeper into NATO and allied territories. [**Moscow** essentially wants
to create more **defense in depth** by extending out-of-area denial
capabilities on both sides of the Arctic as well as across North Pole
approaches]{.underline}.80

[[**Russia's regional military posture** is increasing **risks**]{.mark}
[linked to]{.mark} horizontal [escalation]{.mark} to and [from the
**Arctic theater**]{.mark} to **regional theaters** of
**operation**]{.underline}.81 If [it remains unlikely that a conflict
directly **erupt** in the **Arctic** and **about the
Arctic**]{.underline}, [[escalation in other theaters]{.mark} [such as
the]{.mark} **[Baltic]{.mark} Sea** and the **North Atlantic** as well
as **Northeast Asia** and the **Sea of Japan** [could spill]{.mark}over
over **[into]{.mark}** and through **both sides of [the Arctic]{.mark}
itself.**]{.underline}82

[**[Russian behavior]{.mark}** [and the **risk** of
**miscalculation**]{.mark} [could]{.mark} [place]{.mark} **regional
NATO** and [**US assets** in **dangerous
situations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Several]{.mark} US and NATO
[military assets could be]{.mark}]{.underline} theoretically [[at risk
from **Russian long-range missile systems**]{.mark} and **air
capabilities**]{.underline}83 --- [[especially]{.mark}
[considering]{.mark} the extension of [Arctic
runways]{.mark}]{.underline} in coastal airfields [as well as the range
extension of **Russian tactical aviation**]{.underline}.84 These assets
include the US Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, the US naval air
station at Keflavík in Iceland, the Pituffik space base in Greenland,
the Bodø air station in Norway, and theUS theater missile defense
systems in Northeast Asia.85

Despite this situation, deterrence against the Kremlin's ambitions of
denial must factor in that Moscow does not have the assets or the
capabilities to conduct interdiction operations beyond the AZRF.
Regardless of Russian messaging, [[Moscow should not be allowed to
believe it can close off **critical Arctic choke points** in the
**Bering Sea** or]{.underline} [the **High North**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(GIUK-GIN-Bear gaps)86 or that Russian forces could interdict US and
NATO access to the North Atlantic SLOC through long-range and standoff
systems. In other words, deterrence should focus on "bursting the
Bastion bubble" and deny Russia the ability to message regional
superiority that it can conduct "SLOC interdiction operations.

### Russia Deterrence Turn\-\--1AR

#### Russia [exploits]{.underline} a lack of American presence. The plan is necessary to increase deterrence.

Foundation For American Innovation. 9-19-2024.
https://www.thefai.org/posts/confronting-america-s-polar-icebreaker-gap

[[The **Arctic**]{.mark} [is]{.mark} no longer just a **frozen
expanse**---it is **[quickly becoming a geopolitical
hotspot]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As its ice diminishes, its economic
potential has increased. Arctic shipping routes between the Atlantic and
Pacific offer the potential to reduce travel times by up to 40%, and the
area is estimated to contain 13% of the world's undiscovered oil and 30%
of its untapped natural gas reserves. However, [far [less]{.mark}
[attention]{.mark} has been [given to]{.mark} what is required for
successful **[U.S. deterrence]{.mark}** in the Arctic, **[particularly
in countering Russia's assertiveness]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[The Arctic is **particularly valuable** for **America's
competitors**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Russia has used the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} (NSR) [to bypass the West\'s \$60-per-barrel oil
price cap]{.underline}. In 2023, a record 80% of Russian oil exports
were shipped via non-G7 tankers, avoiding the cap, with exports to China
rising by 23% since the invasion of Ukraine. Oil shipments along the NSR
have also surged, growing from zero before the war to over ten in 2023.
[Given the Arctic\'s strategic]{.underline} economic and **[military
importance]{.underline}**, the U[.S. must bolster its **infrastructure**
and military **capabilities** for **successful deterrence**, which it
currently lacks.]{.underline}

During his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier
this year, General Gregory M. Guillot, the Commander of the U.S.
Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), warned that "we're severely outnumbered"
and have limited "freedom of maneuver" in the Arctic. [[The numbers
**concerning icebreakers**]{.mark}, which are [crucial for **enabling
naval forces** to **navigate ice-covered waters**]{.mark}, [are]{.mark}
**particularly [stark]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Compared to Russia's
seven **nuclear-powered** and thirty diesel-powered
icebreakers]{.underline}, [the **U.S. operates** only **two
diesel-powered icebreakers**]{.underline}. Since the Polar Sea, one of
the U.S.'s two heavy polar icebreakers, suffered an engine casualty in
2010, the Coast Guard has relied on the Polar Star as its sole
operational heavy icebreaker.

Meanwhile, [**[Russia]{.underline}** [continues to **expand its
icebreaker**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**fleet** to reinforce its regional
**dominance**]{.underline}. Through its Project 22220 initiative,
[Russia is developing at least six **nuclear-powered
icebreakers**]{.underline}: three already built, a fourth under
construction, and two more in development. [[Decades]{.mark} of
sustained investment [have given Russia a **commanding** **presence** in
the Arctic---one that the **U.S. is currently unprepared to
counter.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Delays and rising costs have beset efforts to modernize its Arctic
icebreaker fleet. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program won't deliver
its first icebreaker ready until 2029. Unresolved design issues and
rising material and labor costs have increased the price of the first
three ships by 39 percent. As a result, the Coast Guard must spend \$15
million per year to repair the aging Polar Star, which first entered
service in 1976. The U.S. Coast Guard assessed that America needs at
least eight icebreakers -- four heavy and four medium ships -- for its
future polar missions. Without a shift in Arctic policy, the U.S. and
its allies may struggle to counter Russia's increasing influence.

Such a shift will require collaboration. Currently, the U.S. ranks 19th
in global shipbuilding. Increased coordination with allies is essential
to reduce costs, accelerate production, and innovate. In July 2024, the
U.S., Canada, and Finland launched the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
(ICE Pact) to pool resources and enhance polar capabilities. While the
ICE Pact is a key step in strengthening the West\'s Arctic strategy,
further cooperation with NATO allies is needed, especially as a Pentagon
report from July 2024 warned of growing Arctic ties between Russia and
China.

[Long-term icebreaker needs cannot be met without greater shipbuilding
cooperation with allies]{.underline}. Two existing laws prevent the
Coast Guard from building vessels or major components in foreign
shipbuilding ports. The President can authorize an exception if it is in
the national security interest -- and this clearly is. Both Canada and
Finland are close NATO allies with a shared interest in countering
Russian power in the Arctic. If the President is serious about closing
the force projection gap, exemptions to allow shipbuilding collaboration
with our allies will be necessary.

[In addition to icebreaker production, increased **military
cooperation** with allies is crucial for **effective
deterrence**]{.underline}. Access to Alaska's Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base has enabled the U.S. and
its allies to conduct joint military exercises, such as the Arctic
Defender exercise in July 2024, which involved approximately 500
personnel from the U.S., Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France.
Expanding exercises like Arctic Defender -- particularly among other
Arctic nations -- would further bolster interoperability, improve
operational readiness, and communicate collective resolve to deter
adversaries.

The Coast Guard should also collaborate with commercial companies to
expedite the design and construction of additional icebreakers. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office found that delays in the Polar Security
Cutter program were caused by beginning construction before the design
was completed. Partnering with the private sector could streamline the
process and accelerate production. While the U.S. ordered its first
commercial icebreaker last month, more are needed to close the
icebreaker gap. Alaska's congressional delegation secured \$125 million
in funding for this purchase, but broader congressional support is
essential to meet the full scope of Arctic security needs.

[Polar ice may diminish, but tension over the Arctic will only increase
as its strategic value grows]{.underline}. On September 10, 2024, Russia
and China began a massive week-long \"Ocean-24\" joint naval exercise
covering the Arctic Ocean, indicating that their growing alignment may

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [[**Failing** to **establish**]{.mark} a surface
[presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [with]{.mark} [icebreakers could yield
an "**asymmetric equalizer**]{.mark}" [for
**adversaries**]{.mark},]{.underline} [a risk that becomes **more
imminent** as **polar ice melts** and access to the **Arctic
increases**.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, "the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it, however serendipitously." [[**Russia** and
**China**]{.mark} [are]{.mark} actively [moving]{.mark} the [Great Power

[**[Russia]{.mark}** [is arming its icebreakers with **anti-ship

nations are regularly patrolling the **Arctic** seas **with
icebreakers**]{.underline}, [and heavily investing in **nuclear
technology** for these **vessels**]{.underline}. While icebreakers are
certainly necessary for the Coast Guard's missions---including search
and rescue, navigation, environmental protection, interdiction, and ice
operations---[**[Russia]{.mark} and China** have [**embraced
icebreakers** as dual-use]{.mark} [assets]{.mark} that **squarely
address** the **Navy's purpose**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the Navy and
Air Force's existing **submarine** and **aircraft presence** in the
Arctic is inadequate for the Great Power Competition]{.underline}.
[[Submarines and aircraft]{.mark} alone [cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}

are **paramount** for]{.mark} **[successfully deterring Russia's

respond to specific missions.

[[NATO and allies must define what **capabilities** they **will require

across the NATO 7 nations critical capabilities gaps abound, in cold
weather hardware, ice-strengthened assets, ice-capable ships with
anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities,129 infrastructure suited
for effective early warning threat detection systems and air defense,130
radar coverage and aerial domain awareness, subsea sensing, and
Arctic-related logistics and resupplies, among others.

An essential part of the US DoD Arctic strategy's "monitor-and-respond"
approach is to enhance US Arctic capabilities in critical areas such as
domain awareness and dedicated cold weather equipment.50 [Yet the US and
the Arctic 7 as a whole have a low **starting point** in terms of cold

In fact, while Trump criticizes his predecessors for mishandling Russia,
he risks overlooking the lessons of previous U.S. administrations.
[Those who believed that]{.underline} **[[normalizing
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** and engaging constructively [with
**Moscow** would [lead to peace]{.mark} were **[proven
wrong]{.mark}**.]{.underline} From George W.
**[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Barack
**[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[each]{.mark}

invading [[Georgia]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2008 [and
[then]{.mark}]{.underline} annexing [[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2014. By repeating this mistake, [the [U.S]{.mark}. may inadvertently
**[enable Russia]{.mark}** [to achieve its]{.mark} strategic
[goals]{.mark}, **[undermining]{.mark}** the **security of
[Europe]{.mark}** [and the]{.mark} **broader [international
order]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Putin's desire to speak directly to his U.S. counterparts reflects his
desire to return to a model of great-power politics, where the United
States and Russia can negotiate as equals and agree on spheres of
influence. [[Putin]{.mark} [sees]{.mark} [Russia as a global power with
a]{.mark} **[legitimate right]{.mark}** [to **dominate the

Similarly, Trump has shown signs of an expansionist mindset, aiming to
assert U.S. dominance through both military and economic power. He has
suggested using military force to secure control over the Panama Canal
and Greenland, as well as using economic coercion to gain control of
Canada. While the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration [risks

Finally, [with its [attacks on **Ukraine**]{.mark}, Russia has
[**officially debunked** the]{.mark}]{.underline} oft-repeated
[[narrative]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[its]{.underline}]{.mark}
economic [[interests]{.mark} guarantee its participation [in
preserving]{.mark} regional **[peace]{.mark}** and **stability**.
[Moscow has **long harbored grand designs** of developing its]{.mark}
vast **[Arctic coastline]{.mark}** and extracting **more** of the
resources found off them]{.underline}. As a result, many believed it
would have an interest in maintaining peace and stability in the Arctic,
so that it could attract foreign investment to these projects and
increase cargo traffic in the Northern Sea Route. But [[it's
**hard**]{.underline}]{.mark} to believe in this logic, or [[to take
**comfort** in reports of Russia's]{.mark} relatively **[restrained
conduct]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}, at a time [[when its
government has **substantially increased** its **military
assets**]{.mark} in the region [and]{.mark}]{.underline} when Russian
President Vladimir [[Putin is **openly threatening
war**]{.underline}]{.mark} if other states cross his red lines.

The West's unease on these points can be seen clearly in its
surprisingly robust and united effort to pull the plug on the Russian
economy by imposing coordinated sanctions on its key sectors. However,
Western leaders will also need to grapple with another dimension of
great-power politics as they attempt to isolate Moscow: the
inevitability of greater Chinese presence in the Arctic, and, more
broadly, the presence of other non-Arctic states.

As Western capital and technologies depart from Russia's energy sector,
[Moscow will be **more prone** to cooperate with **Beijing**
on]{.underline} developing [its Arctic resources, an outcome that would
further complicate Arctic governance]{.underline} by directly exposing
it to the dynamics of the U.S.-China great-power rivalry. And if Beijing
increases its commercial stakes in the Arctic, that would also make it
harder for the U.S. to denounce China's once-ridiculed narrative that it
is a "near-Arctic" state that should be included in any regional
agenda-setting initiatives.

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the
[U.S. and Russian militaries]{.mark} [have]{.mark} **[for
decades]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[been]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very
[careful]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} [directly
shooting]{.mark} at one another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it
might end.]{.underline}** Q: [Are we close to full-scale world
war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No. The U.S. has **not
attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not attacked** the
U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely likely at this
point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of [Russian military
strikes]{.mark} on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is there a more likely course
of Russian retaliation against the U.S.? D\'Anieri: [Such an attack
[must be]{.mark} regarded as **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If such an attack were to
take place, [the U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely seek to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in a way that is]{.mark}
**[proportional]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[but **not
escalatory**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [[**Uncertainty** about]{.mark}
what would lead to]{.underline} [**[escalation]{.underline}**
[explains]{.underline}]{.mark} [[why]{.mark} the [U.S. and Russia
take]{.mark}]{.underline} **[such [care]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
avoid]{.mark} direct [combat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as they
**support competing sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has
sought to intervene in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will
continue to do so. One might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not
seen them thus far in this war. That suggests the [[Russians
understand]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} **[too are
vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also quite likely that [with
Russian forces already **overextended** fighting against **Ukraine**,
[Russian leaders realize]{.mark} that a [**second major conflict** is
not in their interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} Q: Checking in at 14 months,
how heavy is the cost of war for Russia, in terms of the human toll and
economics? Has Russia made resource and allocation adjustments in the
past months that will allow it to sustain these losses? D\'Anieri:
Russia's recent war efforts appear to be unsustainable. They have lost
large numbers of soldiers and expended significant amounts of
ammunition, such that commanders in the field are complaining about
shortages and are suggesting that they may soon have to switch from
offense to defense, which is less costly in terms of people and
materiel. Overall, the Russian economy is holding up. Growth is very
slow, and shortages of various imported goods are mounting, but there
are no signs that economic factors will severely constrain the war
effort any time soon. However, it would appear that [before the Russian
military could undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline},
[a significant **program of recruitment**,]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}**, [and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need
to take place]{.underline}. [It appears that [Russia **cannot
retake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the offensive in

[The downturn in relations between the West and Russia]{.underline} in
recent years, which some describe as a new Cold War (Legvold, 2016),
[has led to]{.underline} **[renewed concern]{.underline}** [about the
possibility of major war]{.underline} in Europe. Since the conflict over
Ukraine in 2014, most of the institutional ties between the West and
Russia that were put in place in the 1990s and 2000s have been frozen or
abandoned, the United States and the European Union (EU) have imposed
financial and other sanctions on Russia, and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Russia have intensified military deployments and
planning for a possible war with one another. [Russian and Western
military activities have resulted in a significant increase in close
military encounters]{.underline} in the air and at sea, which analysts
fear could trigger an unintended conflict (Frear et al., 2014; Raynova
and Kulesa, 2018). Some observers have warned of scenarios involving war
between Russia and NATO which could escalate to the use of nuclear
weapons (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2016; Shirreff, 2016).
[Drawing on the **growing literature**]{.underline} [on the conditions
of peace between states]{.underline}, as well as Gaddis' Cold War long
peace thesis (Gaddis, 1986, 1991), [this article assesses the prospects
for war and peace]{.underline} between Russia and the West in Europe in
the 2020s and beyond. The first section of the article reviews the
literature on the sources of peace between states, identifying those
factors most relevant to contemporary Western-Russian relations in
Europe. The next section shows how the contested nature of Europe's
post-Cold War order has created an enduring source of tensions and
potential conflict between the West and Russia. The following sections
examine three factors that I argue make [[war]{.mark} [between]{.mark}
[the West and Russia]{.mark} in Europe [unlikely]{.mark}:]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[contemporary European [balance of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [which is best characterised
as]{.underline} [modified bipolarity]{.underline} and
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} important **[[stabilising]{.mark}
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [[the]{.mark}
continuing]{.underline} **[[pacifying]{.mark}
[impact]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of nuclear]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark};
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[relationship]{.underline}** [between Russia and the West,
which]{.underline} [is best understood as one of
**[interdependence]{.mark}**]{.underline} (rather than simple Western
dependence on Russia). Combined with two things that have not changed --
[[the]{.underline} **[deterrent impact]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[of
the]{.mark} likely]{.underline} [[consequences]{.mark} of **any
[extended conventional war]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the
**[reduced risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} surprise or
[pre-emptive attack]{.mark} arising [from]{.mark} the development of
**[reconnaissance satellites]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [[these
factors]{.mark} are **significant forces** likely to **[impose
caution]{.mark}** on Russian and Western leaders and thus act
as]{.underline} [important]{.underline} **[bulwarks against the
risk]{.underline}** [of war between Russia and the West.]{.underline}
This article also examines Western and Russian behaviour in crises
involving the use of force since the end of the Cold War, showing that,
[**despite** divergent positions]{.underline} [and resulting
tensions]{.underline}, [[there]{.mark} [have]{.mark} also
[been]{.mark}]{.underline} **[important [elements of
restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[mutual
[communication]{.mark}]{.underline}** [by both the West and Russia in
such crises]{.underline} -- [[suggesting]{.mark} that [both]{.mark}
sides [are **aware of the risks**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of escalation
and have **taken steps to avoid war**]{.underline}. The possibility of
war between Russia and the West in Europe should not be entirely
discounted and governments should work to maintain channels of
communication and establish confidence-building measures (European
Leadership Network, 2020). Nonetheless, [[despite]{.mark} the serious
[downturn]{.mark} [in]{.mark} Russo-Western
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years, [[one can
be]{.underline}]{.mark} cautiously **[[optimistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} directly against
the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not even be
seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine Lawlor,
senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the Study
of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's military
movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would love]{.mark} it
[if]{.mark} Western [leaders believed]{.mark} that [he might]{.mark}. He
is many things, [but **he is not suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Lawlor says. She adds that Putin ultimately does not want war with NATO
-- particularly given the current state of the Russian army. "[He
couldn't even win a conventional war in Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's
references to potential nuclear war]{.mark} serve as an extension of
capitalizing on Russia's limited economic and military resources to bend
others' will. It's [a tactic the Russian leader has
**accelerated**]{.mark}]{.underline} since first invading Ukraine in
2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the former core of the Soviet Union
as nothing more than a "regional power." The method has worked to some
degree, most visibly by [isolating Germany from its traditional ironclad
allies in the
West](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-09-13/ukraine-chides-germany-for-inaction-as-it-routs-russian-forces)
due to Berlin's protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid
to Ukraine's military. And it has effectively raised concern among
experts who specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be
dangerous to assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says
Jon Wolfsthal, a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group
Global Zero and a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which
annually publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of
nuclear war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United
States Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in
deterrence does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the
lessons of history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is
fragile and can fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on
Putin grow, the concern is that he will not think clearly or may put
more emphasis on survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on
alliances or friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to [90
seconds to
midnight](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-01-24/doomsday-clock-moves-to-90-seconds-to-midnight-as-nuclear-threat-rises)
in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical annihilation,
than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear war from
Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease and climate
volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds that the
primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia -- chiefly
economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin takes
seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war crimes and
is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with a number
of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says. "If there
is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's possible use
of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not been visibly
communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates." Others believe
that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}
mostly [[exposes the extent to which the]{.mark} embattled Russian
[leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark} new sources of
**[leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that leverage is what
he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement that he would
suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the last nuclear
arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What [this
is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a former
top National Security Council official for European affairs, now senior
policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.
"For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s strategy has been to seek
leverage on the West to end its support to Ukraine]{.underline} and
suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to Russia." "This is another
ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like much Russian food, it is
lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests that Putin thinks he can
trade on the promise of resuming Russia's obligations to the treaty to
convince the U.S. to cease its support for Ukraine's goals in the war
and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains. "In that sense, [the
announcement is a big deal symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says,
adding that Secretary of State Antony Blinken was right to call the
statement "unfortunate and irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to
invade Ukraine, [Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence
are]{.mark} **rapidly [dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more
surprisingly, are now exposed as ineffectual. European countries that
previously relied heavily on flows of Russian energy -- particularly
natural gas -- have defied expectations and survived winter so far
without supplies from Moscow. The [endemic rot of
corruption](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-08-31/how-russian-corruption-is-foiling-putins-army-in-ukraine)
within its Ministry of Defense has become widely exposed. Its
conventional military has suffered a string of [embarrassing defeats on
the
battlefield](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/putin-forced-to-address-embarrassing-failures-in-russias-conscription-process),
including during [the beginning of an ongoing
offensive](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2023-02-16/russian-offensive-in-ukraine-begins-with-series-of-failures)
that Russia believed would shift momentum in its favor. The Institute
for the Study of War, like several other private intelligence firms,
believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more as an information
operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's partners in Europe
from providing additional military aid that could be considered
escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated tanks. He has
had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy to provide
Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to remain off the
table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly zone, which
Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit Russia's
ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from the skies.
And while American officials publicly say the course of the war is up to
the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the suggestion that
Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Russia in
2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of providing
weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What Putin also has
in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of some key figures
in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed their perspective
on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent years. With Moscow
once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and more recently
viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an empire by force
at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of Trump finds itself
with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army engaged in a ground
war and being routed by a foreign army without the loss of a single
American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of the commitment.
What that means in the course of a presidential campaign that
prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, [where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons
use](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-06-27/pentagon-blasts-putins-cavalier-nuclear-saber-rattling-as-russia-seeks-new-advantages-in-ukraine).
[With[in Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the [lack of
confidence]{.mark} Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would [comply with their
directives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-putin-orders-a-nuke-will-his-generals-obey/2022/10/19/b5ecd7f4-4f6b-11ed-ada8-04e6e6bf8b19_story.html).
[Using [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy lines
that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is [Russian
forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "[You have to think about the human response to nuclear
use]{.underline}," she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian
soldier who witnesses a rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward
the front lines. "[The symbolism is really important in that the
Russians may assume it would have a devastating effect on the
morale]{.underline} of the surviving Ukrainian forces," Lawlor says.
["At this stage in the war, though, it's not even under consideration
because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations]{.underline}." At least some of those who have engaged with
Putin directly agree. Former Prime Minister [[Boris
Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark} revealed earlier this month that he had
received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He threatened me at
one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt you, but with a
missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something like that. Jolly,"
the conservative politician [told](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64397745)
the BBC. [Johnson]{.underline} later explained to Fox News that he
believed that what Putin was "trying to do was creep me out ... trying
to reduce it to a story about a nuclear standoff between Russia and
NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that [**Putin understands** the **devastating
effect** on **Russia** if it were to launch nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### US-Russia tensions are [high now]{.underline}.

J.J. **Green 25**. National Security Correspondent. \"Analysis: Trump
signals impending shift on Russia amid escalating tensions.\" WTOP News.
5-28-2025.
https://wtop.com/j-j-green-national/2025/05/analysis-trump-signals-impending-shift-on-russia-amid-escalating-tensions/

During a revealing moment at an Oval Office news conference Wednesday,
President Donald [**[Trump]{.underline}** [said a]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[decision]{.mark} point [on **U.S.-Russia relations** is
**coming**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and soon.

When asked directly about Russia's recent aggression and the prospects
for diplomacy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump responded
cryptically: "I'll let you know in about two weeks. Within two weeks,
we're going to find out very soon. We're going to find out whether or
not he's tapping us along or not. And if he is, we'll respond a little
bit differently, but it'll take about a week and a half, two weeks."

This comment --- at once vague and ominous --- raises multiple questions
about what intelligence or diplomatic efforts are unfolding behind the
scenes. It also reinforces Trump's characteristic posture of
unpredictability on foreign affairs, particularly with adversaries such
as Putin.

Decoding the message

[Trump's language]{.underline}, [while **noncommittal** on
**details**]{.underline}, [strongly implies that he believes [Putin may
be **manipulating**]{.mark} **current [diplomatic]{.mark}**
[**overtures**]{.mark} for **strategic gain**]{.underline} --- [possibly
[using ceasefire talks to **stall or distract**]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
**battlefield developments** in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
phrase "tapping us along" refers to a similar comment he made a month
ago, suggesting the Kremlin is pretending to engage while preparing
further escalations.

His mention of a two-week timeline suggests that some type of
assessment, perhaps political or intelligence, may be forthcoming, or
that a deadline has been set internally --- possibly to judge whether
Russia will engage in proposed peace talks in Istanbul on June 2 in good
faith.

Strategic implications

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a post on Truth Social over the
weekend, [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} after three massive Russian
airstrikes in Ukraine[, "I've always had a very good relationship with
Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} of Russia]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
something has happened to him. He [[has **gone absolutely
CRAZY**!"]{.underline}]{.mark}

Responding to subsequent Kremlin comments calling him "emotional," Trump
shot back, saying Putin was "playing with fire."

[[His remarks could **signal** an **ultimatum** to Putin]{.mark} ---
demanding **tangible results** or facing **tougher U.S.
responses**]{.underline} [--- while also [serving as a **warning to
allies** and adversaries that **America's patience**]{.mark} [with
Russia's **escalating aggression** is]{.mark} [**nearing** its
**limit**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Trump's vague yet pointed comments suggest a consequential moment is
approaching. Whether it's a shift toward a tougher posture, a diplomatic
pivot or merely rhetorical posturing remains to be seen.

[But [with **tensions rising** and **Moscow showing no sign of backing
down**]{.mark}, [the next]{.mark} [two weeks]{.mark} [may]{.mark} reveal
more than just [Trump's intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Factor in
Germany's bold move to deliver major new military aid to Ukraine, and
the strategic balance in Europe could be reshaped, which sends an
unmistakable message to Moscow: **The window to get on the right side of
history is rapidly closing.**]{.underline}

Steve **Rosenberg 25**. Journalist for BBC news. \"Trump is taking
US-Russia relations on a rollercoaster ride.\" BBC. 4-4-2025.
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27yqld0qpo

[[When Trump returned]{.underline}]{.mark} to the White House in
January, his direction of travel was clear: [[he set out **to repair
relations** with **Russia**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[There were Trump/Putin phone calls, **high-level US-Russia
negotiations**]{.underline}. At one point Washington voted with Moscow
against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in
Russia\'s war against Ukraine.

Whenever the Trump administration exerted pressure, it was always on
Kyiv, never on the Kremlin.

[But a **week** or so ago the **rollercoaster ride began**.]{.underline}

[[**Trump** made it known he was **angry** **with**]{.underline}]{.mark}
the Russian president\'s comments

After Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** had proposed replacing
President Volodymyr Zelensky\'s administration with \"external
governance\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, President Trump
made it known that he was \"angry\" with Putin.

[\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were
said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky]{.underline},\"
Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when \[Putin\] considers Zelensky
not credible, he\'s supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you
like him or you don\'t like him.\"

After a day playing golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander
Stubb, told the Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is
also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with
Russia.\"

[**[Trump threatened]{.mark}** to impose **[secondary tariffs]{.mark}**
of up to **50% [on Russian oil exports]{.mark}** if **Russia** was found
to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal.]{.underline}

[A bi-partisan group of US senators has gone even further.]{.underline}

[They\'ve drawn up a bill that would impose 500% secondary tariffs on
countries that purchase **Russian oil,** gas and other
resources.]{.underline}

[Up to this point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in
relations between Moscow and Washington]{.underline}. The Nezavisimaya
Gazeta newspaper last month ran a headline stating that US and Russian
officials had \"started speaking the same language\".

**[[This week things changed.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

On Wednesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper accused the Trump
administration of \"administrative insanity... inexperience...
immaturity\".

It criticised the administration\'s \"bragging and arrogance\" and \"its
desire to declare \'huge breakthroughs\' when the first steps have
barely been taken\".

The same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On Ukraine talks,
[[Donald\'s mood changes as often as the wind.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Signs]{.mark}, perhaps, of a [**cold wind** blowing between **Moscow**
and **Washington**?]{.mark}]{.underline}

And yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs this week, Russia
wasn\'t on the list.

Instead, US authorities had organised a sanctions waiver for a key
Kremlin official: Putin\'s foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

Dmitriev flew into Washington for talks with the Trump administration.

[A sign, perhaps, of Russia and America getting on with the business
of... getting along?]{.underline}

But on Friday, another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a
meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.

\"President [[**Trump\'s** not going to **fall into the trap** of
**endless negotiations** about **negotiations**]{.underline}]{.mark},\"
said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether
Russia is serious about peace or not.\"

\"If they\'re not,\" he continued, \"then we\'ll have to re-evaluate
where we stand and what we do moving forward about it.\"

This followed criticism of Russia by America\'s Nato allies. UK Foreign
Secretary David Lammy said Putin \"continues to obfuscate, continues to
drag his feet\".

\"He could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine... We
see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.\"

Earlier on Friday there were rumours that Trump and Putin were about to
speak again on the phone. These were followed by more rumours: the White
House had changed its mind.

The Kremlin said that there were no plans for a conversation.

But there are reports that American companies are planning to take part
in this year\'s St Petersburg Economic Forum.

Okay. Stop the ride. I need to get off.

My conclusions from all of this.

[Trying to follow each twist and turn on the US-Russia rollercoaster can
leave you giddy and confused.]{.underline}

Sometimes it\'s better observing from a distance. [It often helps in
order to **identify the bigger picture.**]{.underline}

Which is this: [for months Donald Trump\'s team avoided criticising
Putin and Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

Key White House officials, like special envoy Steve Witkoff, have
repeatedly embraced and repeated Kremlin talking points. True,
Washington says it\'s growing impatient with Russia and has threatened
tougher sanctions on Moscow. But it hasn\'t imposed any. Not yet.

Will it?

[Is the Trump administration **prepared** to **pressure Moscow** into
ending the war? And would the Kremlin allow itself to be pressured into
doing so?]{.underline}

It\'s a key question as Russia\'s war on Ukraine continues.

#### Ukraine [crushes]{.underline} any chance for effective diplomacy. 

Vladimir **Isachenkov 23**, Correspondent for the Associated Press,
"Russian diplomat says U.S.-Russia relations are in an "unprecedented
crisis"", PBS News Hour, 2/9/23,
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/russian-diplomat-says-u-s-russia-relations-are-in-an-unprecedented-crisis

MOSCOW (AP) --- [Russia-U.S. **[relations]{.mark}** are [in a state of
**"unprecedented crisis"** without]{.mark}]{.underline} any [**sign** of
**[improvement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a senior Russian diplomat said
Thursday.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov argued that [the White House's
[emphasis on]{.mark} increasing]{.underline} weapons [supplies to
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} to ensure Russia's defeat [[leaves no
room for **diplomacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"[I don't see any prospect for a productive **political** and
**diplomatic process**]{.underline}," Ryabkov said at a briefing. "We
have a very deep and unprecedented crisis in Russia-U.S. relations. The
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[has driven them into a
**deadlock**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Ryabkov warned that the U.S. and its allies must carefully assess the
risks stemming from supplying increasingly powerful Western weapons to
Ukraine.

"The Americans need to thoroughly and deeply weigh the risks linked to
their unabashedly cavalier course," he said.

Ryabkov noted that [Moscow doesn't **trust** Western **statements**
about self-imposed **restrictions**]{.underline} on a range of weapons
supplied to Ukraine [in order to avoid **escalation**]{.underline},
adding that [such assurances in the past have served as **cover** for a
**steady expansion**]{.underline} of the assortment of arms deliveries.

"We don't see any sign of reason in any of the NATO and EU members'
capitals," Ryabkov said. "What they are doing isn't going to strengthen
their security."

He rejected the U.S. argument that Russia's refusal to allow the
resumption of inspections of its nuclear facilities represents a breach
of the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact
between the two countries.

The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than
1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.
The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify
compliance.

Just days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia
and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.

Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START
since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused
to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact's future.
Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations
under the treaty.

The U.S. State Department last week said that Russia's refusal to allow
the inspections "prevents the United States from exercising important
rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian
nuclear arms control." It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors
from conducting inspections of the U.S. facilities.

Ryabkov on Thursday insisted that Russia has continued to comply with
the treaty and exchange information in accordance with it. "We adhere to
the treaty and observe its provisions," he said.

At the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow's view that resuming inspections
wasn't possible in the current environment.

Ryabkov's comments followed a Russian Foreign Ministry's statement
declaring that [it was [**impossible** to **maintain "business as
usual"**]{.mark} with Washington [at a time when "the U.S.
has]{.mark}]{.underline} effectively [[unleashed a]{.underline}]{.mark}
total [[**hybrid war** against **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
fraught with a real danger of a direct military confrontation between
the two nuclear powers."

banned countries from testing nuclear weapons under water and in the

States and the Soviet Union were the two countries that wrote most of
the treaty text and haggled over the details. [This [happened a year
after the Cuban Missile Crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, when the two

[Five years later, the two]{.underline} adversaries --- alarmed by the

The important lesson is that two **[[countries don't need]{.mark} to
have [good relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nor do national leaders
even need to like one another, [**for their governments [to work

[The critical reason]{.underline} that [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Russia are not cooperating to
resolve]{.underline} some of [the world's]{.underline} most [pressing
security problems]{.underline} right now [is that [they have **few

Canada and other Western nations.

[In Ukraine, the Kremlin seems to be committed to maintaining a
situation where]{.underline} the government in [Kiev cannot seek deeper
relations with the **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [or
NATO without tacit Russian approval]{.underline}. At most, the United
States and Russia can only agree to contain the war in eastern Ukraine,
and fundamentally disagree about on what terms it should end.

[On]{.underline} the **[[Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**n Peninsula, [there

In Syria, there is a glimmer of hope that the two governments could work
together to expel ISIS from the country. That is only now possible
because Russia has secured its major interest­ --- a Kremlin-friendly
Baathist government in Aleppo --- thanks to the United States, which
worked to topple the Assad government. But divergent Russian and
American goals for the future of Syria once ISIS is finally defeated
will ensure the two governments return to being at loggerheads.

John **Mueller 20**. Senior fellow at the Cato Institute and member of

University, 6-24-2020. \"Nuclear Alarmism: Proliferation and
Terrorism,\"
https://www.cato.org/publications/nuclear-alarmism-proliferation-terrorism.

Nuclear Proliferation

In an influential book, Graham Allison argues that "no new nuclear
weapons states" should be a prime foreign policy principle, and analyst
Joseph Cirincione very much agrees, insisting that nonproliferation
should be "our number one national‐​security priority."5

[There are good reasons to avoid alarmism]{.underline} in this area,
however. First, [the [pace of]{.mark} nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[has been far slower than]{.mark}
has been commonly [predicted]{.mark}]{.underline} primarily because the
weapons convey little advantage to their possessor. Second, [the
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline} of such proliferation that has taken
place [[have been **substantially benign**]{.underline}]{.mark}: those
who have acquired the weapons have "used" them simply to stoke their
egos or to deter real or imagined threats.6

And thirdly, the costs of anti‐​proliferation policy have been very
substantial: the number of people who have died as a consequence of
dedicated efforts to contain nuclear proliferation runs well into six
figures.

Pace

**[[Alarmists have been wrong for decades]{.mark} about the pace of
nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**. [[Dozens of technologically
capable countries have considered]{.mark} obtaining nuclear [arsenals,
but very few have done]{.mark} so.]{.underline} Indeed, as Jacques
Hymans has pointed out, [even supposedly optimistic forecasts about
nuclear dispersion have proved to be too pessimistic]{.underline}.7
Thus, in 1958, the National Planning Association predicted "a rapid rise
in the number of atomic powers ... by the mid‐​1960s."8 A few years
later, C. P. Snow sagely predicted, "Within, at the most, six years,
China and several other states \[will\] have a stock of nuclear bombs,"
and John Kennedy observed that there might be "ten, fifteen, twenty"
countries with a nuclear capacity by 1964.9

As part of that forecasting, it has generally been assumed that nuclear
weapons would be important status --- or virility --- symbols;
therefore, all advanced countries would want to have them in order to
show how "powerful" they were. Thus, France's de Gaulle opined in the
1960s, "No country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself
independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the possession of
nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the hierarchy of
international prestige."10 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who
describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years that Germany
and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear
weapons.11 Such punditry has gone astray in part because the pundits
insist on extrapolating from the wrong cases. A more pertinent prototype
would have been Canada, a country that could easily have had nuclear
weapons by the 1960s but declined to make the effort.12 In fact, [over
the decades, a huge number of countries capable of developing nuclear
weapons have neglected even to consider the opportunity --- for example,
Canada, Italy, and Norway --- even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South
Korea, and Taiwan have backed away from or reversed nuclear weapons
programs, and Belarus, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have
actually surrendered or dismantled an existing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}.13 Some of that reduction is no doubt due to the
hostility of the nuclear nations, but even without that, the Canadian
case seems to have proved to have rather general relevance.

To begin with, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [there is no "technological
imperative" for countries to obtain nuclear weapons once they have
achieved the technical capacity to do so.]{.underline}14 Moreover, like
military prowess in general, [the weapons have not proved to be crucial
status symbols.]{.underline} As Robert Jervis has observed, "India,
China, and Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack by
developing nuclear weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have
increased their general prestige or influence."15 How much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a
great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held
5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much less if they had none?
Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic
growth? Or with its Olympics? As Jennifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe
observe, "Germany, like its erstwhile Axis ally, Japan, has become
powerful because of its economic might rather than its military might,
and its renunciation of nuclear weapons may even have reinforced its
prestige."16

**[[Decades of alarmist predictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[about]{.mark} prolif]{.underline}eration [[chains, cascades, dominoes,
waves, avalanches, epidemics, and points of no return have proved to be
**faulty**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [prolif]{.underline}eration of
nuclear weapons [has been far slower than routinely
expected]{.underline} [because, [insofar as most leaders]{.mark} of most
countries ([even rogue ones) have considered]{.mark} acquiring the
[weapons, they have come to appreciate]{.mark} several [defects]{.mark}:
the weapons are dangerous, distasteful, costly, and likely to rile the
neighbors]{.underline}. Moreover, [as Jacques Hymans has demonstrated,
[the weapons have also been exceedingly difficult to
obtain]{.mark}]{.underline} for administratively dysfunctional countries
like Iran.17

Consequences

[Although we have now suffered through two‐​thirds of a century during
which there has been great hysteria about the disasters inherent in
nuclear proliferation, the consequences of the proliferation that has
occurred have been **substantially benign**]{.underline}. [[The few
countries to which the weapons have proliferated have quietly kept them
in storage]{.underline}]{.mark} and haven't even found much benefit in
rattling them from time to time. And even the deterrence value of the
weapons has been questionable --- the major Cold War participants, for
example, scarcely needed visions of mushroom clouds to conclude that any
replication of World War II, with or without nuclear weapons, was a
decidedly bad idea.18

Moreover, [[there has never been a]{.mark} militarily
[compelling]{.mark} --- or even minimally sensible --- [reason to use
the weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly because of an inability
to identify suitable targets or ones that could not be attacked about as
effectively by conventional munitions. And it is difficult to see how
nuclear weapons benefited their possessors in specific military
ventures. Israel's presumed nuclear weapons did not restrain the Arabs
from attacking in 1973, nor did Britain's prevent Argentina's seizure of
the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of thousands of nuclear
weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied forces did not cause
Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of Kuwait in 1990. Nor
did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or
Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.

[Proliferation [alarmists]{.mark}]{.underline} may occasionally grant
that countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter real or
perceived threats. But many go on to [[argue]{.mark} that the [newly
nuclear]{.mark} [country]{.mark} [will]{.mark}]{.underline} then
[[use]{.mark} its nuclear [weapons to dominate]{.mark} the
area]{.underline}. That argument was repeatedly used with dramatic
urgency for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is
now being applied to Iran.

[Exactly [how that]{.mark} domination business [is to be carried out is
never made clear]{.mark}]{.underline}.19 But the notion apparently is
that should an atomic Iraq (in earlier fantasies) or North Korea or Iran
(in present ones) rattle the occasional rocket, other countries in the
area, suitably intimidated, would supinely bow to its demands. Far more
likely, [any [threatened states]{.mark} will [make common cause]{.mark}
with each other and with other concerned countries [against the
threatening neighbor]{.mark}]{.underline}. It thus seems overwhelmingly
likely that if a nuclear Iran brandishes its weapons to intimidate
others or to get its way, it will find that those threatened, rather
than capitulating to its blandishments or rushing off to build a
compensating arsenal of their own, will ally with others (including
conceivably Israel) to stand up to the intimidation --- rather in the
way they coalesced into an alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

[[It is]{.mark} sometimes [said]{.mark}, or implied, that proliferation
has had little consequence because [the only countries to
possess]{.mark} nuclear [weapons have had rational leaders. But
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[weapons have proliferated to **large,
important countries run by unchallenged monsters**]{.underline}]{.mark}
who, at the time they acquired the bombs, were certifiably deranged:
Josef Stalin, who in 1949 was planning to change the climate of the
Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, and Mao Zedong, who in 1964 had
just carried out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an
artificial famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished.20 It is
incumbent on those who strongly oppose an Iranian bomb to demonstrate
that the regime there is daffier than these.

[The few countries to have acquired nuclear weapons programs seem to
have done so sometimes as an ego trip for current leaders
and]{.underline}, more urgently (or perhaps merely in addition), as an
effort [to deter a potential attack on themselves]{.underline}: China to
deter the United States and the Soviet Union, Israel to deter various
enemy nations in the neighborhood, India to deter China, Pakistan to
deter India, and now North Korea to deter the United States and maybe
others.21 Insofar as nuclear proliferation is a response to perceived
threat, it follows that one way to reduce the likelihood of such
countries' going nuclear is a simple one: stop threatening them.

[Could this lead to "**World War III**"]{.underline} if the United
States, China and Russia support opposite sides of the conflict?

Clary: I think this is already the status quo in the broad geopolitical
tensions between Iran and Israel. The U.S. generally backs Israel for
better or worse due to historical ties and shared values/interests, and
China and Russia generally back Iran. But [[in the event of a **larger
regional war**]{.mark} between Iran and Israel, [it would **unlikely**
draw in]{.mark}]{.underline} any direct [military [response from
**China** or **Russia**]{.mark} --- I don't expect this to be a catalyst
for a much **larger conflict**]{.underline}. Of course, [[**China** and
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark} have an incentive to continue to back
Iran, if for no other reason than it is a friend in the region to both
and that it is a thorn in the United States' side, financially and
politically (i.e. protecting the country from punishment in the United
Nations Security Council for example), but [[like the
U.S.]{.underline},]{.mark} they likely [[have a preference to
**prevent**]{.mark} this [conflict from **escalating** to a
larger]{.mark} direct [war]{.mark}]{.underline} between Israel and Iran.

White: My sense is that Russia would back Iran because Iran is already
supporting Russia by giving it military material, like drones, to use in
Ukraine. Russia already supplies Iran with some advanced equipment like
air defense systems, and Iran and Russia both support the Assad regime
in Syria. But [I see [Russia]{.mark} as **much [more focused]{.mark}**
[on **Ukraine**]{.mark}, and [China]{.mark} more than anything
[wants]{.mark}]{.underline} a steady supply of

Does Disaster Diplomacy Work?

Disasters place human suffering on display---of friends and enemies
alike. As part of the common human spirit, we often hope that, no matter
who is troubled by calamity, we would be moved to help and that help
would be graciously accepted. That process turns out to be tricky in
international politics, when countries experience cataclysms and
multilateral relations determine who provides and who accepts
humanitarian aid. [[Research]{.mark} into 'disaster diplomacy'
[investigates]{.mark}]{.underline} this topic.

Disaster diplomacy investigates how and why disaster-related activities
do and do not influence conflict and cooperation (Kelman, 2012). The key
phrase is 'disaster-related activities' covering (i) pre-disaster
efforts including prevention, preparedness, planning, and damage
mitigation, and (ii) post-disaster actions including response,
reconstruction, and recovery. Disaster diplomacy case studies are not
just about what happens when a volcano erupts in a war zone (Klimesova,
2011) or when enemies consider sending and accepting humanitarian aid
(Akcinaroglu et al., 2011). They also examine the situation before a
disaster manifests, such as how a flood warning system could potentially
bring together communities (Ahmad and Ahmed, 2003) or [[how
**vaccination**]{.mark} **campaigns** [might generate]{.mark} lasting
[ceasefires]{.mark} (Hotez, 2010)]{.underline}.

[[Based on]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[empirical
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of case studies, [[the]{.mark} overall
[conclusion]{.mark}]{.underline} from disaster diplomacy [[is]{.mark}
that]{.underline} disaster-related [[activities do **not**
create]{.mark} new initiatives in achieving [peace]{.mark} or reducing
conflict]{.underline}, but a diplomatic process with pre-existing
conditions can be catalysed or supported (Kelman, 2012). If that
catalysis occurs, then the disaster-related activities influence
diplomacy in the short-term, but not in the long-term.

In the short-term, over weeks and months, all forms of disaster-related
activities have the potential to affect diplomacy, such as by spurring
it on or by providing a space in which peace efforts can be pursued. For
that to occur, a pre-existing basis must exist for the reconciliation.
This could be ongoing negotiations, formal or informal cultural
connections, or trade links. [**[Even over the short-term]{.mark}**,
disaster [diplomacy is not]{.mark} necessarily [successful]{.mark},
since disaster-related [activities]{.mark} can sometimes foment conflict
and reduce diplomatic opportunities---or [have **no impact**]{.mark}
**at all** on peace and conflict]{.underline}. Irrespective of what
happens over the short-term, over longer time periods, [[non-disaster
factors have a **more significant impact**]{.mark} on diplomacy than
disaster-related activities. [Examples]{.mark}]{.underline} of
non-disaster factors [[are]{.mark} leadership changes, **[mutual
distrust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, belief that an **[[historical
grievance]{.underline}]{.mark}** should supersede current humanitarian
considerations, [[or]{.mark} a [desire for conflict due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[advantages]{.mark} gained]{.underline}
from it.

[These [conclusions have been **corroborated through case
studies**]{.mark}]{.underline} covering inter-state conflict,
intra-state conflict, disaster risk reduction, disaster response,
bilateral relations, and multilateral relations. The analysis and
conclusions have been extended to sub-national case studies, including
para-diplomacy (international relations conducted by non-sovereign
jurisdictions) and non-state-level relations and conflicts. Thus far,
the evidence shows that disaster diplomacy has the potential (not
inevitability) for improving inter-state, and other, relations only in
the short-term and only if a non-disaster-related pre-existing basis is
available.

Case Study 1: The 26 December 2004 Earthquake and Tsunami

On 26 December 2004, a large-magnitude, shallow earthquake shook Aceh,
Indonesia, causing tsunamis which raced across the Indian Ocean,
inundating communities in more than a dozen countries around Asia and
Africa. The two countries with the highest death tolls, Indonesia and
Sri Lanka, were each embroiled in long-standing, internal political
conflicts which had been particularly violent over the previous three
decades. Aceh, Indonesia, and eastern Sri Lanka were particularly badly
hit by the tsunami and were also centres for the violence.

Consequently, clear disaster diplomacy opportunities emerged. Both areas
sorely needed major efforts at post-conflict and post-tsunami
reconstruction, neither of which could be completed by the local or
national authorities alone. With a large international presence, with
the world watching as survivors were assisted, and with the need for
extensive efforts to clean up and rebuild from the waves and the wounds,
would this disaster bring the warring parties together and reconstruct a
society alongside the infrastructure?

Amidst the international humanitarian response, the Indonesian
government and militants in Aceh negotiated for and eventually signed a
peace deal on 15 August 2005. Despite violence flaring on occasion and,
still ten years after, many aspects of the post-tsunami and
post-conflict reconstruction being unresolved or incomplete, the peace
is lasting in Aceh. Surely this is a classic case of disaster diplomacy
succeeding?

The answer is 'no' because negotiations had started between the two
parties on 24 December 2004, just 48 hours before the earthquake and
tsunami (Gaillard et al., 2008). There is no doubt that the catastrophe
provided a diplomatic space in which peace could succeed if the parties
involved sought that. We will never know if the ongoing negotiations
would have succeeded in the absence of a disaster, as many previous
efforts had failed. But when the shaking and waves struck Aceh, the
conflicting parties were already in the process of reducing conflict and
aiming for long-term peace. Consequently, the disaster could be used as
an excuse to achieve their long-term goal of an agreement if they wanted
it---and that happened (see also Enia, 2008; Klimesova, 2011; Le Billon
and Waizenegger, 2007).

Simultaneously in Sri Lanka, distribution of the humanitarian aid,
access to areas in the north and east of the country which were not
under government control, and perceptions that people affected in the
south were not being treated fairly led to a spiralling of the violent
and non-violent conflict. Deals were reached and then broken or
overturned. In November 2005, Sri Lanka elected a hard-line president
who campaigned on pursuing military means for ending the conflict. That
was achieved in 2009, when Sri Lanka's military could finally declare
that they had ended the armed struggle against Colombo. An uneasy peace
continues in Sri Lanka.

Why did disaster diplomacy never take off in Sri Lanka? The major
parties involved had other reasons for not seeking peace, with examples
being the personal power given by continuing the conflict, concern that
dealing with the violent parties in the north and east would legitimise
them, and mistrust of the other side (see also Beardsley and McQuinn,
2009; Hyndman, 2011; Wickremesinghe, 2006). These aspects dominated
efforts at conflict resolution through disaster response and further
hindered distribution of post-tsunami aid.

Case Study 2: Low-lying Islands under Climate Change

Contemporary climate change is causing major impacts for communities of
low-lying island atolls such as in Papua New Guinea, the Maldives, and
Tuvalu. While no certainty exists of island disappearance or islander
evacuation (Kelman, 2014; Webb and Kench, 2010), some communities, such
as on the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea, have been forced to move
due to climate change (Connell, 1997). This situation has led to a
discourse of so-called 'climate refugees' who are said to be waiting in
huge hordes to invade other countries, leading to massive 'climate
conflict'---a discourse which is politically constructed and so far
unsupported by empirical evidence (Hartmann, 2010; Kelman, 2014).

Nonetheless, the possibility remains that numerous island communities
might need to leave due to climate change impacts, ranging from lack of
freshwater and diminishing food supplies to coral reef deaths and
sea-level rise. In planning for potential movement, negotiating with
other countries is necessary regarding who pays for moving, where to
resettle, and how to govern the migrants. Given the global political
ramifications of answering these questions and the depth to which
identities, cultures, and countries are being affected, it would seem to
have strong potential for bringing countries together to seek a common
good from the global challenge of climate change to which all of
humanity has contributed.

Yet climate change diplomacy has not yet succeeded. The climate change
negotiations under United Nations auspices---the annual United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties---is
wracked by major disagreements and political conflict. So far, a
lasting, legally binding agreement on stemming climate change causes and
dealing with its consequences has not emerged, despite twenty years of
meetings. Island governments and islanders, frustrated by the lack of
progress and worried about the increasingly visible impacts of climate
change on their communities and countries, are instead pursuing
initiatives of their own, rather than waiting for the world to come
together over climate change.

One such initiative is Many Strong Voices, which is about developing and
implementing collaborative and strategic actions on climate change for
the Arctic and small island developing states (SIDS). Recognising the
need to act for themselves irrespective of the global political conflict
over dealing with climate change, the Arctic and SIDS peoples are
pursuing climate change adaptation (one subset of disaster risk
reduction) for themselves on their own terms, especially seeking their
own choices and pathways for potential migration (Kelman, 2010; McNamara
and Gibson, 2009). That is difficult, given their small populations and
often limited resources, meaning that they are using their 'Many Strong
Voices' to seek external support---which so far remains limited.

This case study illustrates the disaster diplomacy pattern. Despite a
long lead-time and a global political mechanism for addressing climate
change, agreement has thus far not been reached, forcing those affected
to address disaster risk reduction on their own. Even with a
pre-existing basis in the form a negotiating forum, trying to prevent
disaster emerging from the hazard driver of climate change has not yet
catalysed climate change diplomacy.

The Disaster Diplomacy Process

The disaster diplomacy analyses demonstrate that, [[fundamentally,
disa]{.mark}ster-related [activities are **not a high**]{.mark}
**political [priority]{.mark}**. **Perceived historic wrongs** and
**[domestic politics]{.mark}** can **[outweigh]{.mark}** accepting
[assistance, as]{.mark} shown by [Cuba's refusal]{.mark} to accept
American aid]{.underline} during the 1998 drought and the USA's refusal
to accept Cuba's, Venezuela's, and Iran's offers of aid following
Hurricane Katrina in 2005. [Gaining and retaining political [power can
supersede peace, demonstrated by **Ethiopia's and Eritrea's
intransigence**]{.mark} to link drought relief to conflict resolution
from 1998-2000]{.underline}.

Such examples emerge from national governments, mainly decisions made by
Heads of State, Heads of Government, and their administrations. There
might yet be hope for disaster diplomacy when considering diplomacy
tracks beyond government-to-government relations. Glantz (2000) details
the long history of Cuban and American weather and climate scientists
collaborating while Fidel Castro led Cuba. These collaborations fed into
disaster risk reduction and occurred most likely because the governments
were not aware of them. Ker-Lindsay (2007) explains how the media and
vociferous grassroots expectations fuelled Greece-Turkey earthquake
diplomacy after lethal tremors struck each country three weeks apart in
1999. He then examines how the push from below nearly derailed the
careful, measured approaches towards rapprochement which the elites in
each country had been enacting before the disasters.

The complex web of interactions involving all disaster and diplomacy
activities means that [any [linear analysis of correlations]{.mark} and
connections [is]{.mark} likely to be **[flawed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
given starting point for analysing disaster diplomacy does not
necessarily give a specific, predictable outcome for a case study. Given
the importance of pre-existing conditions in determining whether or not
disaster diplomacy becomes even a short-term catalyst, it is hard to
determine where the starting point for analysis should be.

Consequently, disaster diplomacy is best viewed as a long-running
process with multiple parties interacting, rather than as a snapshot
phenomenon which either works or does not work. Disaster-related
activities are indeed one influence amongst many on all forms of
diplomacy, but trade, resource management, sports, culture,
personalities, domestic politics, and non-domestic politics are also
major influences.

The diplomacy tracks to emphasise are choices, deliberate or
inadvertent, by all parties, including politicians, civil servants, the
media, business leaders, movie and sports stars, and grassroots
movements (amongst others). Similarly, the disaster-related activities
to pursue are choices. Combining disaster-related and diplomatic-related
activities therefore becomes a complex combination of choices and
actions by a complex combination of parties. If someone or a group
decides that disaster diplomacy is desirable, then actively lobbying
for, supporting, and implementing it are pathways to follow. If someone
or a group decides that disaster diplomacy is not desirable, then
actively lobbying against it and undermining efforts for it are pathways
to follow.

Attempting to influence disaster diplomacy pathways could backfire. A
leader, upon being informed about how to implement disaster diplomacy,
could decide that linking disaster-related activities and conflict
resolution is not wanted and, consequently, might stop disaster risk
reduction programmes or avoid humanitarian relief. Open attempts at
reconciliation which are rebuffed by the other side would prove to be a
political nightmare. Openly blocking disaster diplomacy could polarise
others who then become determined to make it succeed.

An overarching challenge is that disaster diplomacy might be attractive
because it appears to be a quick fix for solving conflict. [[It is
**naïve** to expect]{.mark} that [decades]{.mark} or centuries [of
differences]{.mark} could be [overcome overnight]{.mark}, simply because
a tornado destroyed a town or a multinational building code was
promulgated]{.underline}. In contrast, it is a truism that successfully
dealing with both disaster and diplomacy are long-term processes,
requiring thoughtful, careful steps, whilst ensuring that all key
parties continue to be on board to support the long-term goals and to
serve mutual interests---at least, in theory. In practice, too much of
diplomacy and disaster-related activities is done reactively with
limited planning---which could mean that a disaster diplomacy case study
might eventually succeed through luck.

Because, in the end, the scientific truism holds that absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence. [**[No successful
examples]{.mark}** of new diplomacy based only on disaster-related
activities [have]{.mark} yet [been identified]{.mark},]{.underline} but
many historical archives have not been explored while future disaster
risk reduction or disasters could overturn the current conclusions.
Nonetheless, for the moment, [the [evidence]{.mark} available
[shows]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [that [disaster diplomacy is
**not**]{.mark} **an [effective]{.mark} way** for improving inter-state
relations]{.underline}, but also that disaster diplomacy should not be
relied on to be effective for improving any relations over the long
term.
