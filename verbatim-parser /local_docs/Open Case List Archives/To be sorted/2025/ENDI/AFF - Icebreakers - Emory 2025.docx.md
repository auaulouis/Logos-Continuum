The annual 'Operation Deep Freeze' is one of the world's great feats of
maritime endeavour. But [[the Stars and Stripes is]{.underline} [a
**rare sight** in **icy waters** of the **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and Antarctic. [[The **Polar Star** is the]{.mark} **[only operational
heavy icebreaker]{.mark}** that [the]{.mark} United States **[Coast
Guard possesses]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"[The US has a **very small fleet** of [icebreakers]{.mark}, **one
heavy** and **two medium**, and they're **[old]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
really [spend]{.mark} a **lot of [time in
maintenance]{.mark}**]{.underline}," says Cynthia Cook, director of the
Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS). "[[We have]{.mark} **relatively few** ---
**[fewer than we need."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Donald [**[Trump]{.underline}** [agrees]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [US [president plans to order 48
**icebreakers**]{.mark} to help dramatically **expand** the US
**presence** in the increasingly contested **polar
regions.**]{.underline} Russia already has world-leading icebreaker
capabilities, while China is taking a growing interest in the Arctic and
its mineral riches.

[B[ut **no American shipyard** has **built** a **heavy icebreaker in
decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [A [programme to construct
three such vessels]{.mark}, known as Polar Security Cutters, was
approved in Mr Trump's first term, but [is **years behind schedule** and
**significantly over budget**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This reflects a **much wider malaise** in **American**
**shipbuilding**]{.underline}. The US built 5% of the world's
ocean-going commercial ships in the 1970s. Today, the figure is 0.1%.
The protectionist Jones Act of 1920, which requires vessels sailing
between US ports to be built domestically, has done little to help US
shipbuilding remain globally significant.

#### Last summer, the US signed an agreement called the [ICE Pact]{.underline} to buy icebreakers from [Canada and Finland]{.underline}. But that effort faces barriers, and even if successful, it won't [solve the need]{.underline} for American-made ships.

[But [as they approach the massive task of **rebuilding**]{.mark}
[America's maritime strength,]{.mark} **[policymakers]{.mark}** [face
**uncomfortable choices**. Do **they prioritise ships**, or
**shipbuilding**]{.mark}?]{.underline} [[The fastest way to acquire
**new vessels**]{.mark} [is to **order** from **allied**]{.mark}
**[countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [such as **South Korea** and
**Japan**]{.underline}, which boast the strongest shipbuilding
industries outside China. [Investing in domestic shipbuilding, by
contrast, would create **far more jobs** and help **restore** the
**country's industrial base**, but would take much **longer** to
**accomplish**.]{.underline}

How the administration resolves this dilemma will have drastic
implications for global trade and geopolitics.

Breaking the ice

[[As the US begins the journey towards **reviving its shipbuilding
industry**, **icebreakers are top of the to-do
list**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In the icebreaker industry, however, it is not China that occupies top
position --- but Finland.]{.underline} The Nordic nation's prowess with
icebreakers is perhaps not surprising, given that its ports freeze solid
each winter. Today, Finland designs 80% of the world's icebreakers and
builds more than 60%.

[The sudden surge in US interest in icebreakers could therefore provide
an enormous boon for Finnish industry.]{.underline}

"I have never seen this level of interest in icebreakers globally," says
Mika Hovilainen, CEO of Aker Arctic, a Finnish company that designs and
tests icebreakers. It is a time of "dramatic change" in the industry, he
explains. Finland's shipyards lost one of their leading customers when
it became unacceptable to deliver vessels to Russia after it invaded
Ukraine. But demand for icebreakers on the other side of the Atlantic
could more than compensate for this loss.

Finland's expertise with icebreakers was one of the arguments used to
justify its admission to Nato in 2023. [[Last]{.mark} [July]{.mark},
[the US and Canada agreed to]{.mark} establish an Icebreaker
Collaboration Effort --- known as [the **ICE Pact**]{.mark} --- [with
**Finland**]{.mark}, [in which the three countries will
co-operate]{.mark} [in **sharing expertise** and
**resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[**It remains** to be seen if]{.mark} Mr **[Trump]{.mark}**
[will]{.mark} **fully [support the ICE Pact]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Collaborating]{.mark} [with allies may]{.mark} seem to [contradict his
'**America First'** **philosophy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Indeed, in
announcing]{.underline} [his plan for 48 new US icebreakers]{.underline}
in March, [the president took a potshot against Canada, a **country** he
**hopes to annex**.]{.underline}

"We're going to order 48, and Canada wants to be part of the deal," said
Mr Trump. "I say, 'You got to get your own icebreakers. I mean, if
you're a state, you can be part of the deal, but if you're a separate
country, you've got to get your own icebreakers.'"

Collaboration

Mr [Trump has been **more positive** about the **US relationship** with
**Finland**]{.underline}, however. In late March, he hosted Finnish
president Alexander Stubb for a game of golf, posting on social media
afterwards that the US and Finland would work together on the "purchase
and development" of icebreakers.

[[Ordering icebreakers]{.mark} directly [from Finland would **require a
change to regulations** that]{.mark}]{.underline} [require US Navy and
[Coast Guard **vessels**]{.mark} to [be **built
domestically**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finland's ICE Pact coordinator
Reko-Antti Suojanen tells fDi Intelligence that a "relaxation" in these
regulations is "the only way to come to our common goals."

[[There is support]{.mark} in the US Congress [for reforms that would
allow the US to work with]{.mark} [allies to speed-up naval
construction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Republican senators Mike Lee and John
Curtis introduced legislation in February that would allow the US Navy
and Coast Guard to order vessels from allied countries, if the cost is
cheaper than it would be from a US shipyard.

[[But these **proposals** will have to **contend with fears** that
**closer collaboration could** **further weaken** the **US shipbuilding
industry**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Meanwhile, [Canada and Finland have been working collaboratively since
even before]{.underline} [the **ICE Pact** was **signed**]{.underline}.
Helsinki Shipyard, a world leader in icebreaker construction, was
acquired by Canada-based Group Davie in 2023, having previously been
under Russian ownership. In March, the Canadian government awarded a
C\$3.25bn (\$2.27bn) heavy icebreaker contract to Davie. Construction
will begin at Helsinki Shipyard and be completed at Lévis in Quebec.

The project will be "an excellent showcase of what can be achieved if
there is a well-functioning national co-operation in place", says Kim
Salmi, managing director of Helsinki Shipyard.

He adds that his company has "unique expertise" in icebreaker
construction. "No other shipyard in the world has delivered as many
icebreaking vessels as we have."

"We are also able to build ice-going vessels with the fastest schedule
on the market, in 36 months or quicker depending on requirements."

#### The plan solves. Rather than relying on allied ships, the US should construct its own [nuclear-powered]{.underline} icebreakers which provide [better]{.underline} and [more reliable]{.underline} access to the Arctic.

\"Securing the north: Expanding the United States' icebreaker fleet.\"
Military Times. 1-26-2022.
https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2022/01/26/securing-the-north-expanding-the-united-states-icebreaker-fleet/

[One of [the **biggest challenges**]{.mark} [facing]{.mark} [the United
States' **capability**]{.mark} and capacity [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**defend** its **interests**]{.mark} in the far north [is the **dearth
of icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Icebreakers]{.underline} are
imperative to the national security of the United States and its Arctic
territories. Their [importance is]{.underline} also [growing due to the
continued **melting** of the **polar ice caps**]{.underline}, [the
encroachment of non-Arctic nations to the region]{.underline}, including
China, [and heightened tensions over]{.underline} pre-existing
[territorial disputes]{.underline} [and new economic opportunities in
the]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline}. However, [**despite** their
**importance**, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' **[fleet]{.mark}**
of icebreakers [has been **severely neglected**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[Icebreakers are indispensable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[for]{.mark} a **multitude**
of **reasons**]{.underline}. Not only do they keep trade routes free
from winter sea ice and escort shipping vessels safely through
ice-covered passages, but they also help supply winter bases, oil rigs,
drill sites, and scientific missions with the necessary equipment and
cargo year-round. With the retreating northern ice caps, global shipping
is increasingly using northern routes for Asia to European trade
bypassing the Panama and Suez canal. These shifts can drastically cut
shipping times but also allow nations with a significant arctic fleet to
hold global trade at risk.

[The icebreakers also serve the vitally important role of [protecting
**energy**]{.mark} **claims** [and]{.mark} **keeping
[fisheries]{.mark}** from **foreign exploitation**]{.underline}. The
U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic holds over 90 billion
barrels of oil and 1,669 trillion cubic feet of gas, the majority of
which is commercially viable. Additionally, Arctic fisheries offer a
vast, and growing, source of wealth for Arctic nations --- the average
annual catch value is estimated at over \$500 million, another incentive
for non-arctic states to encroach on the region. Just last year a
massive Chinese fishing fleet encroached on U.S. territorial waters with
no regard for international law or sustainable fishing regulations.

**[Icebreakers]{.underline}** often [serve as [moving research
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} and [platforms]{.underline} with teams
[[conducting **scientific research**]{.mark} in the Arctic, including
vital **climate change-focused**]{.underline} **[research]{.underline}**
[helping to tackle one of the **region's largest threats**]{.underline}.
The simple presence of icebreakers in the Arctic also sends an important
message to potential adversarial nations showcasing the United States'
readiness and willingness to defend its interests in the region.

[Despite these growing needs, [the U.S. Coast Guard currently **only
operates two** **icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Polar Star
(already 10 years over its 30-year life expectancy) and Healy (which
suffered an electrical fire in 2020 and was only recently repaired),
both diesel-powered. The only other two U.S.-based icebreakers are
privately owned or operated by the University of Alaska.

In comparison, China operates two (and is developing a third), while
Russia's armed forces operate at least 46 --- including three that are
nuclear-powered, extending both their power and durability. These
numbers do not take into account those currently under construction or
planned, and both nations are investing heavily in expanding their
fleets. Russia has also re-militarized a dozen Cold War-era arctic bases
to expand its naval presence in the region and to use as berths for its
numerous active icebreakers.

**[[NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region, [such as **Norway
and Canada**]{.underline}, [also [own icebreaker
fleets]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, **[[none of them are
nuclear-powered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Norway's fleet is focused
on]{.underline} [territorial defense]{.underline} against increasingly
aggressive Russian incursions while Canada's fleet is currently
comprised of smaller vessels focusing on scientific research and search
and rescue efforts. Thus, [[the U.S. cannot]{.mark} [rely on its
**Northern**]{.mark} or **European**]{.underline} [**[allies]{.mark}**
for **defense posturing** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [This lack of a
substantial U.S. fleet of]{.underline} [icebreakers, the absence of
**nuclear-powered** **vessels**, and **reliance** on allied]{.underline}
**[icebreaker]{.underline}** [posturing in the region is a **major
flaw** in the US national security strategy]{.underline} and defensive
umbrella, [which needs to be addressed as **quickly as
possible**]{.underline} and is an important strategic investment the
United States needs to make immediately.

Currently, the two Coast Guard icebreakers fall under the jurisdiction
of the Department of Homeland Security whose budget is anemic compared
to the Department of Defense. [The Coast Guard does not have the budget
to obtain enough]{.underline} [icebreakers to **contest Russian** or
**Chinese** presence in the Arctic]{.underline} --- [each heavy
icebreaker has an **average cost** of approximately \$800
million]{.underline}. While, accumulating the same number of icebreakers
as Russia is unnecessary, moving forward all potential solutions to
securing America's North requires the purchase of icebreakers,
regardless of their status: new or used. Coast Guard Commandant Karl
Schultz has stated that "a fleet of nine U.S.-flagged icebreakers" would
be sufficient to meet our economic and security needs in the far north.

Thankfully, Congress has already initiated expanding America's arctic
security program by authorizing the construction of six new Polar
Security Cutters (PSCs), three heavy and three medium icebreakers.
However, it is only actively funding the first four.

The next vital step to securing the North is to fully fund and expedite
the construction of these six PSCs, especially given the fact that the
first PSC is currently planned to be delivered only in late 2024 if it
stays on schedule. This is extremely important as expanding the current
fleet's missions comes with opportunity costs, thus necessitating a
larger fleet to be able to cover all possible icebreaker missions in the
region.

[[A]{.mark}nother [longer-term option]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can
also be done simultaneously to the PSC program, [[is to increase]{.mark}
the available [funding for the **Coast Guard**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[specifically [focused on **Arctic security**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**establish** **partnerships**]{.mark} with
**private corporations** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**design** and
**construct** the United States' first **nuclear-powered icebreaking
vessel**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While more expensive, [**[nuclear
icebreakers]{.mark}** [come with many]{.mark} [benefits]{.mark} over
diesel-powered vessels]{.underline}, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark}
[both]{.underline} **[[longevity]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[range]{.mark}**, [and **power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including
increasingly vital, **soft power**. [With]{.mark} the additional range
and longevity of [nuclear icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline} [[comes a
reduced need fo]{.mark}r the United States to build [**expensive** and
**difficult**]{.mark} to **maintain [arctic bases]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[--- the icebreakers become de facto **mobile bases**.]{.underline}
Additionally, [the nuclear-powered ships can conduct **longer** and
**more missions**, **cementing U.S. positioning in the
region**.]{.underline}

A different and swifter approach would involve working with the
Department of the Navy to authorize the purchase of an icebreaker under
the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. This would not only expand the Navy's
mission to include patrolling of the far North but could also lead to
involving NATO forces in the region. This would also be a welcome step
to counteract Russia's recent decision to establish a new Arctic fleet
within their navy, acting as a strong signal of America's willingness
and readiness to defend its northern territories and those of its
allies.

Regardless which option is given the go-ahead, it would also be
beneficial to simultaneously encourage the development or purchase of
private icebreakers, whether by corporations or public institutions. For
example, there is also an existing U.S. icebreaker available for
purchase, the Aiviq, currently owned by Edison Chouest Offshore, valued
at only \$150 million. There are also ships in Finland available for
lease that could fill gaps until the PSCs come online. The private
purchase and leasing options would maximize the United States' presence
in the region.

[[For the United States to remain]{.mark} economically]{.underline} and
militarily [[competitive]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and maintain its territorial integrity in
the region[, [it requires a substantial fleet of new, **advanced**, and
**durable icebreakers**, as **soon as possible**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The first vital step is to fully fund and expedite the construction of
the currently authorized six PSCs. These will enable the United States
to continue to secure the freedom of the seas, ensure its national
security, and expand economic and academic opportunities to its
institutions in the region and beyond.

#### Icebreakers are key. They give the US a chance to develop a [world-class]{.underline} shipbuilding industry it [can't]{.underline} find in other sectors.

The **[Biden]{.underline}** administration previously [identified
**icebreaker ships** as a **promising**]{.underline} **[starting
point]{.underline}**, [and I would **expect continuity
here**]{.underline}. [In addition to the geopolitical]{.underline}
[**importance** of the **Arctic**]{.underline}, [[it may be easier for
the US to compete in markets for]{.mark} **relatively [specialised
vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline} [--- [such as **icebreakers**]{.mark} ---
[where **price** and **quantity** are not]{.mark} [the only
factors]{.mark} that [buyers]{.mark} typically
[consider]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[benefits to starting
from]{.mark} **virtually [zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The need to
construct]{.mark} [new facilities is an opportunity to
**deploy**]{.mark} at scale the most **[advanced manufacturing]{.mark}
[technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It should also be easier to
optimise the co-location of new **commercial** and **defence production
facilities**, rather than deal with **stranded** legacy **assets**.
[This presents an **opportunity**]{.mark} [to build a **larger
manufacturing ecosystem**]{.mark} that includes the **adjacent
technologies**, supply chains and applications required for any shipyard
to operate effectively.]{.underline}

Ultimately, however, the shipbuilding industry is a game of competitive
subsidisation. The major shipbuilding nations provide considerable
support to their industries, and Michael Lind has recently shown how the
elimination of subsidies under the Reagan administration resulted in the
precipitous decline of US shipyards despite the Jones Act.

With that in mind, [US [policymakers]{.mark} [will need to **consider**
more **robust forms of**]{.mark} **[investment
support]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[in addition to]{.mark} the
**[measures]{.mark}** **already [announced]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} **administration**]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline}
**[shipyards]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the vessels they produce
[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} ample [[opportunities
for]{.underline}]{.mark} [[creative]{.underline}]{.mark} public-private
financing structures as well [as **[procurement]{.mark}** and
**contracting [mechanisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[America]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} somehow [managed to financially engineer seemingly]{.mark}
[everything except]{.mark} **critical [national security]{.mark}**
[**supply chains**]{.mark} and **technologies**; [**shipbuilding**
offers a **chance to rectify that**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### [Robust shipbuilding]{.underline} is [necessary]{.underline} for [naval dominance]{.underline}.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), ranking member of the Armed Services
Committee, wants you to be as alarmed as he is about this: [If
[deterrence]{.mark}, which [failed]{.mark} regarding
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**, [fails]{.mark} regarding
**[Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, this might be because adversaries
understand that U.S. [[leaders]{.mark} have [allowed]{.mark} the
nation's **[defense]{.mark} industrial [base]{.mark}** to
[become]{.mark} **shockingly [short]{.mark}** [of **capacities**]{.mark}
[commensurate with]{.mark} the world's multiplying
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The U.S. [Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
the nation's **[[principal means of power
projection]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [the answer to the "**tyranny of
distance**" in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} --- is Wicker's foremost
concern. [Production of stealthy, lethal **attack
submarines**]{.underline}, which Wicker calls "[the **crown jewels** of
U.S. military power]{.underline}," [should]{.underline}, he says, **[be
doubled]{.underline}**. [The Navy has only 49, and Wicker says nearly 40
percent cannot be deployed because of **maintenance
delays**]{.underline}. So, crews endure grueling operation tempos.
Retention falls. [Just to fulfill the 2021 AUKUS]{.underline}
(Australia, United Kingdom, United States) [commitment without reducing
the U.S. supply of attack submarines]{.underline}, [U.S. production
would have to be 2.3 to 2.5 submarines a year]{.underline}. Since before
the AUKUS agreement, Congress has been providing funds for two a year,
but **[only 1.2 are being built]{.underline}**. Today's total U.S. fleet
is not quite 300 ships. The fleet has generally been under that number
for 20 years. A 355-ship fleet, the goal set at the end of the Obama
administration, is a statutory aspiration, but would be 100 too few. A
just-published study by Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain now with
the Sagamore Institute, notes that although a Biden administration
document endorses 381 ships, the [Navy's shipbuilding budget is
consistently **much too low** to meet proclaimed goals]{.underline}. A
ship's life is about 30 years. More than half the [Navy's battle
force]{.underline} has been in the water for more than 20 years. This,
Hendrix writes, "[drives dramatically increased costs to maintain the
fleet in good repair]{.underline}. Thus, **[[despite increased
budgets]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[maintenance]{.mark} has [**crowded out
money** for **new construction**]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[Shipbuilding
facilities sufficient]{.mark} to fulfill the aspirations [do not
exist]{.mark} and cannot be quickly created]{.underline}. China, Wicker
says, has more productive capacity in one shipyard than exists in all
U.S. shipyards combined. [Such is the U.S. [maintenance
backlog]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[one attack [submarine]{.mark} was
[idled]{.mark} for five years]{.underline}**. Another, after a 2021
accident in the South China Sea, probably will not be operational until
2026. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Wicker and former senator Phil
Gramm (Tex.) note: "Like David's smooth stone that slew Goliath, two
Ukrainian Neptune missiles sank the flagship of the Russian navy in the
Black Sea. With 400 U.S. Harpoon missiles, costing only 0.3 percent of
its GDP, Taiwan could imperil any Chinese warship in the Taiwan Strait."
But [[munitions]{.mark} inventories [are]{.mark} **radically
[inadequate]{.mark}** [to sustain **high-intensity
warfighting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. military is experiencing
the worst recruiting shortfall in 50 years. Wicker thinks this is
related to "the injection of hyperpolitical culture into our fighting
forces." Imagine what the Chinese military thinks when a Navy secretary
says climate change is as important a challenge as recruiting. (The Navy
missed this year's recruiting goal by 7,000 sailors.) The word "climate"
appeared 63 times in the Biden administration's 48-page 2022 National
Security Strategy. The military's alarming material deficits are perhaps
matched by intellectual ones. [President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping has
reportedly directed China's military to be able to attack, blockade or
otherwise [subdue Taiwan]{.mark} by 2027]{.underline}. [[Unless the
defense industrial base is]{.mark} **urgently
[enlarged]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[America's military will]{.mark}
be]{.underline}, as some policy experts have observed, [like a great
football team that can [play only through the first
quarter]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Hence, Wicker's conclusion: "[[We
are in our **most dangerous security moment**]{.mark} since World War
II]{.underline}." Winston Churchill wrote that early in 1942, "[the
[foundation of all our hopes and schemes]{.mark} was the **[immense
shipbuilding programme]{.mark}** of the United States]{.underline}."
"Immense" is no longer applicable. The ubiquity of wars throughout
history, and the menacing nature of this moment, strongly suggest that
we are living in what historians will describe as yet another span of
"interwar years." History will not kindly judge national leaders who,
while complacently producing \$2 trillion annual budget deficits, were
parsimonious regarding the preparations for war that are necessary, if
not always sufficient, for preventing war.

#### Naval dominance [prevents]{.underline} global conflict escalation in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. 

Seth **Cropsey 22**. Senior fellow and director of the Center for
American Seapower, Hudson Institute. "Global Naval War."
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2022/12/15/global_naval_war_870332.html

Because this [[conflict]{.mark} is Eurasian]{.underline}, it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[naval]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Its
[**greatest flashpoints** are]{.mark} **enclosed [maritime]{.mark}
spaces**]{.underline}, [commercial and **strategic [nexus]{.mark}
points** in]{.underline} the [Eurasian littorals]{.underline} -- the
[[Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} and [Eastern
[Mediterranean]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Strait of
[Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[Bab-el-Mandeb]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [**[S]{.mark}**outh and **[E]{.mark}**ast **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**eas are all **crucial chokepoints** for **global
commerce**]{.underline}. The [[contest for
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark} may have landward elements, but it [is
**essentially [naval]{.mark}** [in character]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is [**readily [apparent]{.mark}** [in Asia]{.mark}]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} the CCP's [[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark} has [expanded
its [capabilities]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [[**express purpose**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an [assault on [Taiwan]{.mark} and **concurrent
naval war** with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} and its allies.
It is marginally less apparent in Europe, where Russia wages a ground
war in Ukraine. Even in Ukraine, however,
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} objectives have been [[maritime in
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, if not in character. Russia seeks to
conquer a country that, if added to its productive power, would give the
Kremlin a stranglehold over the global wheat, corn, barley, and
fertilizer supply. Ukraine added to the Kremlin's domain would also
provide it with an ideal base from which to dominate the Mediterranean,
play a decisive role in the Middle East, and regulate the Suez
chokepoint. Thus, even a power so decidedly continental as Russia still
employs a maritime strategy. The United States can, in the abstract,
encounter each threat individually. Yet the issue is twofold. First,
these threats are likely to come in sequence. This may be intentional: a
coordinated trans-Eurasian campaign is possible. Indeed, the issue of
force coordinated is largely overrated. China and Russia need not fight
alongside each other in the same battlespace apart from if Russia
deploys its submarines to support China in the Western Pacific. Hence
the question is not of operational coordination or even theater
strategic coordination, but very general coordination at the political
level. It may also be opportunistic at a lower level. Major power war
will be foreseeable in an operational context: it is hard to move masses
of men and materiel to readiness without detection. But smaller probing
actions are more difficult to anticipate. Minor revisionist powers, Iran
for example, may take advantage of American distraction and use limited
capabilities to stress the U.S.' strategic position. Larger powers may
employ opportunistic pressure. Second, these [[threats]{.mark} can be
[deterred only by]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**comprehensive
[military]{.mark}** [prepared for]{.mark} **large-scale
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S. military is not prepared for this.
It lacks the stockpiles, manpower, or industrial base to sustain a major
confrontation. Ukraine would burn through American annual 155-millimeter
shell production in two weeks, and annual American Anti-Tank Guided
Missile production in two months. Unmanned Aircraft System platforms in
Ukraine last three or so missions and are destroyed at 90 percent. War
is massively expensive and requires a massive amount of equipment. This
is true on land and at sea. Platforms themselves are irrelevant if they
cannot be sustained in combat. And the U.S., with its atrophied
industrial base, will struggle to expand production within the next two
to five years. There is a **[significant [danger]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that the [U.S.' [allies identify]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[window]{.mark}
of opportunity [in which]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite its nominal
military superiority, it [[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[stockpiles
to]{.mark} fight and [win]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[long-term
major-power war]{.underline}**. A multi-front war would be immensely
stressful to American capabilities. It may be reasonable to expect,
despite capability gaps that persist between the U.S. and its rivals,
that a coordinated campaign in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East would
crack the United States. [This can be [prevented]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [[U.S.' ability to deter]{.mark} conflict]{.underline} should be
[[regained]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile the [U.S.
[Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} - the primary warfighting arm for any future
Eurasian conflict, [must be [**expanded** and]{.mark}
**[better-resourced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The current NDAA is a start,
providing \$45 billion more than the Biden administration\'s initial
proposal. Yet this is, at best, a minimal initial move. The Pentagon
expects China\'s combat fleet to grow from its current level of 340
ships to 400 by 2025, or 20 ships yearly. Were the U.S. to build 20 each
year, it would reach --- in 2025 --- slightly above China's current
fleet size, but the Biden administration isn't even planning to build
half that number.

#### Our impact is [empirically proven]{.underline}. History shows that [naval power]{.underline} is [directly related]{.underline} to [global stability]{.underline}.

[**[Centuries of global rivalry]{.mark}** [show]{.mark} how]{.underline}
a [[country's power]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[decline]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [is [**directly related**
to]{.mark} the [size and capability of]{.mark} its **[naval]{.mark} and
maritime [forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [ability to ship goods in
bulk from places]{.underline} where [they are produced to
places]{.underline} where [they are scarce]{.underline} has **[long
represented]{.underline}** an [expression of **national
power**]{.underline}. Athens had a robust navy as well as a large
merchant fleet. Carthage in the third century B.C., Venice in the 13th
and 14th centuries, and the Dutch republic in the 16th and 17th
centuries also fielded merchant and naval fleets to pursue and protect
their interests. In this way, they were able to transform their small-
and medium-sized nations into great powers. Following the Napoleonic
wars in the early 19th century, a large Royal Navy effectively knitted
together the British Empire upon which "the sun never set." By the
latter half of that century, the British maintained a "two-power
standard," whereby the size of the Royal Navy had to meet or exceed the
next two navies combined. That ultimately proved unsustainable. [It
was]{.underline} the [[doubling]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [[U.S.
Navy]{.mark} battle force]{.underline} under President Theodore
Roosevelt [that [catapulted]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to **global**]{.mark} **power
and [prominence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Most historians view the
14-month world cruise of [new U.S. battleships]{.underline} ---
Roosevelt's Great White Fleet --- as [the [birth of]{.mark}]{.underline}
what would come to be known as [[the **American
Century**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**The dramatic expansion** of the U.S.
fleet through two world wars]{.underline} --- finishing the later
conflict with more than 6,000 vessels, by far the largest navy ever
afloat --- [set]{.underline} the [country on its **superpower
path**]{.underline}. Finally, Ronald Reagan's 600-ship Navy, [[as much a
**p**]{.mark}ublic **[r]{.mark}**elations [campaign
as]{.mark}]{.underline} it was [a **[shipbuilding
plan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, helped [[convince]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it **would not win**]{.mark}
the Cold War]{.underline}. Throughout history, [[large
naval]{.underline}]{.mark} and merchant [[fleets represented not just a
**power multiplier**]{.mark} but]{.underline} an [[**exponential growth
factor** in terms of]{.mark} **national
[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [All **historical sea powers**
recognized this]{.underline} --- [until they didn't]{.underline}. In
October 1904, Adm. John "Jackie" Fisher was appointed first sea lord of
the Royal Navy. He arrived in office certain who the enemy was ---
Germany --- but also with clear direction from civilian leadership to
tighten his belt and accept declining naval budgets. Fisher's solution
to this strategic dilemma was to dramatically shrink the fleet in order
to pay for modernization while also concentrating the remaining ships
closer to Great Britain. His investments in modernization were
breathtaking --- most notably the introduction of a steam-turbine,
all-big-gun battleship, the HMS Dreadnought, which would lend its name
to all subsequent battleships that followed, transforming global naval
competition. But Fisher paid for his modernized vessels by massively
culling the 600-ship Royal Navy he inherited from his predecessor. "With
one courageous stroke of the pen," then-Prime Minister Arthur Balfour
approvingly stated, Fisher slashed 154 ships from the Royal Navy's
active list. Fisher classified some of these ships as "sheep," which
were sent to the slaughter in the breakers' yards; others as "llamas,"
downgraded but retained in the reserves; and still others as "goats,"
which retained their guns with the stipulation that no further
maintenance funds would be allocated to them. The cull, however, wasn't
cost-free. Most of the cuts were taken from gunboats and cruisers
assigned to nine distant stations where Britain had national interests,
such as in Asia or Africa. The cuts generated great criticism not only
from within the Royal Navy, which was manned by officers with long
experience and strong views regarding the importance of a naval presence
overseas, but also from the British Colonial and Foreign Offices, which
instantly recognized that they would no longer be able to call on
readily available Royal Navy ships to support the nation's diplomatic
interests. Ultimately, Fisher did modernize his fleet in the short term.
Both the Dreadnought class battleships as well as their consorts, the
smaller Invincible-class battle cruisers, rendered all previous designs
instantly obsolete. What Fisher did not anticipate was that his
contraction and modernization of the Royal Navy would create two
simultaneous effects: It destabilized the international environment, and
it triggered a global naval arms race. Britain had already been under
pressure in the Far East and had asked Japan for assistance protecting
its interests there, but now it found itself without a fleet of
sufficient size to defend its interests in other geostrategic locations
like the Caribbean and Africa. It had to trust a new partner, the United
States, to take on that job. The only alternative would have been for
Britain to simply forgo its colonial interests in order to focus on what
it viewed as the preponderant German threat in the Baltic, North Sea,
and northern Atlantic Ocean. There were other [[knock-on
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Having [surrendered]{.mark}]{.underline}
its [dominant [lead in]{.mark} **overall [ship]{.mark}
number[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[Britain found itself
in]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[new **naval arms race**]{.underline}]{.mark}
in which its previous, sunk-cost investments in older ships offered no
benefit. To its dismay, Britain began this new arms race from nearly the
same position as its geostrategic rivals. Soon every European power, as
well as the United States and Japan, was building modern dreadnoughts,
and Fisher and his navy were unable to maintain or reestablish their
previous two-power standard. Today, Fisher's strategy would be
recognized as a [[divest-to-invest]{.mark} modernization
plan]{.underline}. And the lesson is clear: Britain found that it was
[[unable to preserve]{.mark} **even the [facade]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
being a [global power]{.mark}]{.underline}; it was [[**quickly reduced**
to]{.mark} being a **[regional]{.mark} maritime [power]{.mark}** [on the
**periphery**]{.mark} **of Europe**]{.underline}. The
[**[ensuing]{.mark} conditions** of [international
instability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[shifting alliance]{.mark}
structure[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[global arms race]{.mark} contributed to]{.underline} the [outbreak of
**[World War]{.mark} I** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[end of

### Advantage\-\--Arctic Research\-\--1AC

#### Arctic research is being [thwarted]{.underline} by a lack of icebreakers now.

As Russia and China Eye the Arctic, [**U.S. Lacks** **Critical
Icebreaker Fleet**]{.underline}

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates Navy
currently operates 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, nine cruisers,
and around 75 guided-missile destroyers -- but it [[lacks a **type** of
**vessel**]{.mark} [that could be]{.mark} **increasingly
[important]{.mark}** should it be required [to operate in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since 2022, [the Pentagon has been warning that the U.S. needs more
icebreaker ships]{.underline}. The ice may be melting in the great white
North, but **[icebreakers]{.underline}** [are **still** [**required**
for]{.mark} the U.S. to have **[year-round access]{.mark}** to what is
**likely** [to be an increasingly **contested
region**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} United States [Coast Guard]{.underline} -- which is
part of the Department of Homeland Security not the Department of
Defense -- [currently operates just two aging icebreakers.]{.underline}

[[The problem was made **worse**]{.mark} **this past
summer**]{.underline}, [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} USCGC
[[Healy]{.underline}]{.mark} (WAGB-20), the largest and most
technologically advanced icebreaker, [[was **taken** out]{.mark} of
**service [due]{.mark}** [to an **electrical**]{.mark}
**[fire.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[That forced]{.mark} the
**[cancelation]{.mark}** of **two [scientific missions]{.mark}** [to
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Arctic]{.mark} via the **Northwest
Passage**]{.underline}. The other icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10)
-- which is like WAGB-20 homeported in Seattle -- is tasked to travel to
McMurdo Station, Antarctica, annually.

[[A 2023]{.mark} study]{.underline} (updated in July 2024) from the
Congressional Research Service [[concluded]{.mark} that [the
U.S.]{.mark} [requires]{.mark} at least [**eight** or **nine polar
icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a stopgap, the Coast Guard
announced it would acquire a commercial icebreaker and station it in
Juneau, Alaska.

Melting Ice Makes the Problem Worse

This is not entirely a new problem, but it is one that climate change
could make worse. In early 2022, [the Pentagon **warned** that it
**required additional icebreakers**]{.underline}, especially as Russia
has put renewed interest in the Arctic region.

The melting ice has opened up new shipping routes that previously didn't
exist, while the region is rich in resources. To [protect U.S. interests
**may require deploying** **warships** to the **Arctic**]{.underline}
[-- and while the ice is melting, it does return in the winter,
necessitating the **need** for more **icebreakers**.]{.underline}

"[Strategically, icebreakers provide **persistent presence** in a way
that's not met by **anything** else in the **maritime
region**]{.underline}," Randy Kee, who had served as the senior advisor
for arctic security affairs with the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic
Security Studies, explained in a Pentagon report. "[Remember, the Arctic
is a maritime region, and [icebreaking provides you **year-round
access** to be able **to go in the region."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Without the icebreakers, the U.S. may "not be able to participate in the
opportunities opening up or protect its interests," the DoD further
warned.

#### Upgrading research capabilities by procuring [new icebreakers]{.underline} is key.

[[A new report]{.mark} from the **National Academies** of
**Sciences**]{.underline}, Engineering, and Medicine [[outlines]{.mark}
the [importance of **access**]{.mark} **to the**]{.underline} Southern
Ocean and Antarctic coast for [**research** on **critical aspects** of

related to **climate change**]{.underline}. [[**Aging**

vessel**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and other **equipment** [that can]{.mark}
[support]{.mark} continued and [expanded **U.S. research and
technological** **interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}, says the new report.

[[A robust U.S. **research presence**]{.mark} in [these regions]{.mark},
which [are some of the harshest]{.mark} and most remote [places on
Earth]{.mark}, [is essential]{.mark} for **national security** and
economic **interests**,]{.underline} the report says. [[It
identifies]{.mark} three thematic [scientific drivers]{.mark} --- global
**[sea-level]{.mark} [rise]{.mark}**[, the **global carbon cycle**, and
**changing ecosystems**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and related
high-priority research questions as justification for renewed investment
in vital infrastructure and programs in the near term, especially
construction of a Polar Class 3 Antarctica Research Vessel (ARV).

"[These areas of **scientific research** may be physically far away from
the U.S., but the **effects** of **climate change** on these areas and
their resources are felt close to home,"]{.underline} said Paula
Bontempi, dean of the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University
of Rhode Island, and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report.
"The U.S. is a leader in Antarctic and Southern Ocean research, and we
must make a continued commitment to understanding these large systems
that have national and global impacts."

The urgency of this research is increasing, as Antarctica's ice sheets
may be approaching a dangerous tipping point toward a prolonged period
of ice loss driven by climate change. Antarctica's 58 meters of
sea-level rise potential will have global-scale impacts, yet uncertainty
remains about rates and extent of ice mass loss and the long-term
trajectory of sea-level rise. The Southern Ocean is also where most deep
waters rise to exchange carbon with the atmosphere, and is responsible
for about 40% to 50% of the net removal of fossil fuel derived CO2
emissions. Thus, there is a need for scientists to better understand how
its carbon reservoir may change. The ecosystems in this region are also
uniquely adapted to extreme environments and perform important functions
that regulate the exchange of energy, nutrients, and carbon throughout
the area's food webs. Considerable uncertainty remains about how
ecosystems are responding to a changing climate and may impact important
natural systems that directly or indirectly benefit humans and global
economics.

The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is
charged with supporting Antarctic science and logistical operations.
However, the aging science infrastructure that serves the region will
not be able to support the research necessary to advance U.S. interests.
Without major and immediate investments, including urgent investment in
a new ARV, the U.S. will fall behind other nations in research that is
essential to national security, the report says.

"[[The U.S. is already behind schedule in updating our]{.mark}
scientific infrastructure in the region, **especially** for **[aging
research vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said committee co-chair Alan
Mix, distinguished professor of earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences
at Oregon State University. "While the committee applauds the tentative
commitment of the U.S. government and NSF toward an ARV, [NSF must
urgently move forward with next steps to make a **new vessel** and other
**needed infrastructure** a reality]{.underline}."

Increased Demand for Icebreakers

The diversity of potential situations in which icebreakers might be
employed must also continue to be considered in acquisition planning. As
of 2020, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [polar icebreakers
conduct]{.mark} **primarily two missions**]{.underline}. [The first is
**[scientific research]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [performed together with
the National Science Foundation and other partners: Understanding polar
environments is [important]{.mark} [in **characterizing global
weather**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[oceanographic
patterns]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[as well as]{.mark} how these **are**
**changing over time**]{.underline}. [The second mission is
[resupply]{.mark}]{.underline}, primarily [[for **research**]{.mark}
**[stations]{.mark}** in]{.underline} Antarctica but also for [remote
**Alaskan communities**]{.underline}. For example, during the winter of
2011--2012, the medium icebreaker Healy enabled a tanker to deliver
critical fuel supplies to the city of Nome, Alaska. In addition, [these
[cutters]{.mark} have **enabled [presence]{.mark}** and
**[readiness]{.mark}** for possible [polar]{.mark}
**[contingencies]{.mark}**, such as **search-and-rescue
events**]{.underline}; the Healy was present for parts of the Crystal
Serenity's historic transit of a large cruise ship from Seward, Alaska,
to New York through the Northwest Passage with 1,700 passengers and crew
members aboard (Rosen, 2016).

[[All signs point to an]{.mark} increased [demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
the Coast Guard's missions in the coming decades]{.underline} and
potentially expanding roles for these cutters. [[**Scientists** need to
**conduct research** on]{.mark} **[polar climate conditions]{.mark}**
[to increase]{.mark} their [understanding of]{.mark} regional influence
on [the]{.mark} [rest of the world.]{.mark} Foreign and domestic
commercial interests will continue to]{.underline} [explore the polar
regions in search of shorter **transit times** for vessels;
**extraction** of **resources**, such as **minerals**, **oil**, and
**fish**; and **tourism**]{.underline}. Some of this monitoring can be
done from the air or via satellite. For the next several decades,
however, [human beings will still need to **actively** **collect** and
**evaluate samples** from the **polar regions**]{.underline}. In
addition, demand for resupply and even rescue may grow as the poles
become more accessible thanks to reduced summer ice cover, contributing
to increased human activity in the region. As this occurs, U.S. policy
requires the Coast Guard to maintain a capability to oversee national
interests by executing its statutory missions.

Furthermore, U.S. interests and maritime mission demands in the Arctic
and Antarctic will always differ from each other because of immutable
geographic considerations: The Antarctic is a land mass surrounded by
water, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, including the
U.S. state of Alaska. The Arctic contains permanent populations, some of
whom have lived there for millennia, as well as resource extraction that
dates back decades. Although the region has some diplomatically managed
maritime boundary disputes, almost all of its lands are unambiguously
part of specific nations. On the other hand, the Antarctic and its
surrounding oceans have no permanent inhabitants and no commercial
activity except fishing and are subject to unrecognized claims by
various nations. The absence of commercial activity may change because
the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty that forbid resource extraction
in the region (Argentina et al., 1961) are open to revision in 2048,
well within the lifetime of future polar icebreakers. [If **extraction**
of **oil** or **minerals** led to disaster, U.S. **icebreakers** might
be **needed to help respond**.]{.underline}

#### Emerging diseases from the Arctic are inevitable. Increased research is [essential]{.underline} to [detect]{.underline} and [respond]{.underline} to them.

Searching for \"cold hard\" proof of global warming? Look no further
than the melting ice of the Arctic. Warming twice as fast as the rest of
the planet, the region is recognized as a frontline for climate change.
With potential global implications, the thaw begs the question: Do we
know what pathogens lie in wait underground?

[Imagine [the **next pandemic**]{.mark} [developing from]{.mark}
**harmful [microbes]{.mark} present** [within]{.mark}
**[permafrost]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [part of the long-frozen Arctic
terrain]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} scenario may sound like science
fiction but [is an **all-too-real threat**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In 2016]{.mark}, for example, [13 people in Siberia]{.mark} [became
ill from anthrax]{.mark} spores [linked to]{.mark} the thawed carcass of
[a reindeer]{.mark} that died [75 years prior]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[**[Surveillance systems]{.mark}** do [exist]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
monitor]{.mark} such [incidents]{.mark} as **disease** presents in
people]{.underline}. But [[no system exists to]{.mark} **[detect
pathogens]{.mark}** [in the **environment**]{.mark} before **diseases
strike**.]{.underline}

\"Essentially, we know when people get sick, but we don't always know
the locations where people were exposed,\" says MITRE epidemiologist
Alex Wu. He led a MITRE research team in taking the first step toward
developing a more proactive approach to battling diseases that could
emerge from permafrost.

[Our [experts]{.mark} [reviewed the state of the science]{.mark} of
current efforts to surveil pathogens in the Arctic]{.underline}. [They
[identified a **significant gap** in **understanding**]{.mark}
[where]{.mark} potentially **dangerous** **[microorganisms]{.mark}**
[may **reside in permafrost**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And [they
demonstrated]{.mark} how **[pathogens]{.mark}** [could be **mapped to
alert public health officials**]{.mark} [to their presence]{.mark}
**before people fall ill**.]{.underline}

\"[[We need an **integrated system**]{.mark} [that combines]{.mark} the
information from [permafrost]{.mark} thaw, [climate]{.mark} prediction
models, human activity, [soil]{.mark} microbial [data]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} [locations of]{.mark} human and animal
[remains]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Wu explains. \"[[This will be vital to
the next **phase** of **fighting diseases** at their **origin** to
**prevent their spread**.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}

The icy Arctic has long been home to myriad pathogens. While frozen,
these pose no risk to human health. But [increasing human engagement in
the region means as temperatures increase,]{.underline} [so does
**people's risk** of **harmful exposure**]{.underline}. From indigenous
populations and oil pipeline staff to U.S. military personnel, those
living and working in this remote territory may become vulnerable.

Wu, formerly an epidemic intelligence service officer for the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has long held a
fascination with the Arctic area. In his youth, he spent many summers
visiting Alaska with family friends---and became fascinated with its
beauty.

When he came to MITRE in 2021 and learned of our independent R&D
program, it prompted a proposal to explore the question: \"[How can we
prepare for another pandemic-type pathogen that could blindside us from
other regions, such as the far North?\"]{.underline}

warm. Sea ice cover, which has endured for millennia, is quickly
disappearing, thinning and shrinking as the biome heats up at twice the
rate of the rest of the world. In the absence of ice, southern species
are moving north, sometimes making refugees and relics of long-term
residents.

We also know [[we can no longer afford for the **Central Arctic Ocean**
to be a **mystery**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As the region heats
up]{.underline}, [[the web of life]{.mark} that once tied together
cold-loving species living]{.underline} [in]{.underline} and near [its
enigmatic waters [has **begun to unravel**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and
may]{.mark} soon verge on [collapse]{.mark} as the **old guard fails**
to **compete** wi]{.underline}th, and gives way to, [a new regime with
largely **unforeseeable consequences**.]{.underline}

**[[All of Earth's natural systems hang in a delicate
balance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Add too much of]{.underline} [one thing
--- carbon dioxide, aerosols, nitrogen, Homo sapiens --- or subtract too
much of another --- forests, freshwater, keystone species --- and
suddenly biodiversity and **biomes can go askew**]{.underline}. Put more
eloquently, [**[scientists]{.underline}** [theorize]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that [there are **nine**]{.mark} **[planetary boundaries]{.mark}**

[If we do exceed these boundaries]{.underline}, [our **societies** and
**species**]{.underline} [--- our safe operating spaces for **humanity**
--- are in **jeopardy**.]{.underline}

So far, [we've already surged into the danger zone for four of the nine
planetary]{.underline} [boundaries]{.underline}: climate change,
biodiversity, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows (disruption
of the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles). [[This is]{.mark} particularly
[bad]{.mark}]{.underline} [[news for **Arctic Ocean
biodiversity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which has felt some of the
ramifications of these]{.underline} **[[life support]{.mark} [system
imbalances]{.mark}]{.underline}** and shocks far sooner than anywhere
else on Earth. [Like dominoes **falling** into **one
another**]{.underline}, [**serious changes** are **[impacting]{.mark}**
[life]{.mark} at the **top** of the world.]{.underline}

One of the most sweeping polar biodiversity changes involves Arctic
microbes: As warming sea thin ice cover, phytoplankton --- free-floating
microscopic marine algae --- are booming.

Phytoplankton form the basis of the marine food web and they're
dependent on sunlight to grow. In the Arctic Ocean, blooms often occur
over the continental shelves after ice melt in open water when the
microalgae is bathed in 24-7 sunlight in summer. Indeed, much of the
biological production in the Arctic takes place in these areas due to
the formation and melt of annual sea ice, which regulates the
biogeochemical cycling of organic carbon and other elements in the water
column.

But in 2011, scientists discovered a massive and utterly unexpected
phytoplankton bloom underneath thinned Arctic sea ice in the Chukchi Sea
between Alaska and Russia, one of five peripheral seas of the Arctic
Ocean. Biologists had previously believed this almost impossible; sea
ice and snow reflect incoming solar radiation, starving plant-life of
energy.

But the thinning of sea ice had allowed light to penetrate the dark
waters of the Arctic Ocean, allowing phytoplankton to photosynthesize
and flourish.

"Climate change has made the Arctic more productive," says Kevin Arrigo,
a biologist at Stanford University who led the study published in
Science. "Because there's so much first-year ice in the Arctic, and it's
thin and flat, light has an easier time reaching the water below."

Arctic phytoplankton blooms now last longer. And they're more abundant
in terms of how much biomass is produced. Though scientists found
evidence of such blooms occurring in the past if the conditions were
exactly right, these under-ice blooms are happening more often as [the
"Arctic is more amenable to blooms than it used to be."]{.underline}

Every Arctic species relies on energy from phytoplankton. Krill and
copepods eat the plankton, which in turn are eaten by fish, which are
eaten by seals, which are eaten by polar bears. "Everything starts with
phytoplankton," says Arrigo.

At first glance, the microscopic blooms would appear to be good news.
More productive northern waters should help Arctic species. But that's
not strictly the case, Arrigo says. "There's a potential dark side." [As
climate change destabilizes phytoplankton at the base of the food
chain,]{.underline} "[the Arctic is becoming less like the Arctic and
more like the North Pacific."]{.underline}

Increasingly, southerly animals are moving in to take advantage of the
new productivity.

One fish, two fish, red fish, new fish

[[Warming seas]{.mark} have [triggered a **poleward shift** in fish
species]{.mark} in the Arctic, [reshuffling the food web]{.mark} as we
know it.]{.underline}

The peripheral Barents Sea, north of Norway, is one of the
better-studied Arctic marine regions where this species shift is
occurring. When scientists surveyed 52 fish species there in a 2017 PNAS
study, they found that Arctic bottom-dwelling species that feast on
shellfish and invertebrates on the seafloor were gradually being
replaced by incoming boreal fish species --- primarily generalist
species, such as cod and haddock --- that eat smaller Arctic fish and
outcompete native species, potentially creating an imbalance in the food
system. These boreal fish have been documented moving into the North
American Arctic and Eurasian Arctic.

"As the North Atlantic is warming, the cod is expanding northward," says
Maria Fossheim of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research. "There's
now more space for it to occupy in the Barents Sea and there's more
food. In the past, subzero temperatures and sea ice stymied their Arctic
advance."

Much of this climate change-driven shift in polar fish species is
occurring near the shallow continental shelf seas bordering the Central
Arctic Ocean, areas traditionally neglected by the world's large fishing
fleets because commercially desirable fish had been sparse there. But
inevitably, analysts say, this climate change-driven move by targeted
species --- including cod, haddock and others --- will lure fleets
northward, putting new environmental pressures on high latitude waters.

Also, as southerly fish move in, native Arctic fish lose out. The polar
cod, for example, is an ice-associated species; it feeds on zooplankton
on the underside of sea ice. With less ice floating atop the ocean along
with warmer temperatures, polar cod populations are expected to decline
17% by the end of this century.

These [changes in the food chain could "alter the **structure**,
**composition** and functions of **future** Arctic
**communities**]{.underline}," reads a recent study from researchers at
Hokkaido University. By century's end, such changes are likely to be
felt in every node of the Arctic food chain, though predicting precisely
what the radically altered polar marine biome will look like is
impossible.

"What we're seeing in this ecosystem is that mammals, fish, seabirds,
and plankton are all moving," says Fossheim. "The whole regime is
shifting. But you can't move everything north. At some point, some
species won't be able to live there." Smaller fish adapted to living at
300 meters depth, for example, can't very well move to 3,000 meter
depths in the Central Arctic Basin. Soon, Fossheim says, these changes
will impel biodiversity loss.

Birds of a feather

For scientists, seabirds are the canary in the Arctic Ocean's coal mine.
"They're very useful indicator species," says Grant Gilchrist, a
research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Birds are long-lived; they can be marked with a band; scientists can
take blood samples; and they can be tracked year to year --- sometimes
by satellite. All these tracking and diagnostic tools are useful in the
remote Arctic environment. Birds "forage and sample in places where it's
hard for humans to sample," Gilchrist says.

Tracking the health of seabirds and their populations, scientists can
gain insights into what's happening in the far North. Few seabirds
venture far into the High Arctic; most live in high densities along the
edges of the Central Arctic Ocean, around the Arctic Ocean gateways.

But the ivory gull is different. It originates in Canada, Greenland,
Svalbard, and Russia, and is dependent on year-round pack ice ---
foraging fish and invertebrates along the productive ice-edge.

However, "Their populations have been declining quite drastically," says
Kathy Kuletz, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service
and a member of the Circumpolar Seabird Expert Group of the Conservation
of Arctic Flora and Fauna. In the last 20 years, it's estimated that
between 80 and 90% of the ivory gull population has been lost. Only
between 8,000 and 11,500 breeding pairs are left in the world.

In 2017, the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, the biodiversity
working group of the Arctic Council, released their State of Arctic
Marine Biodiversity Report. It found that some populations of seabirds
in the Arctic's lower latitudes were also declining; thick-billed murres
in the Atlantic Arctic were decreasing, as were kittiwakes in the
Atlantic Arctic and Davis Strait (between Greenland and Canada's Baffin
Island).

As with other species, climate change is creating winners and losers
among seabirds in an altering Arctic. Though murres, ivory gulls, and
kittiwakes may be struggling, planktivorous seabirds appear to be
increasing in the Chukchi Sea. Conversely, little auk adults are seeing
a decrease in survival rates, perhaps due to negative climate impacts on
their main food source --- Arctic copepods. Black guillemots in the
Beaufort Sea are experiencing more breeding failures as they've been
forced to feed their chicks lesser quality food due to a lower abundance
of polar cod.

The charismatic megafauna

Higher up the food chain, Arctic mammals likewise face an uncertain
future.

In fall of 2021, Fisheries and Oceans Canada will begin consultations on
whether to list ringed seals under the federal Species at Risk Act.
These blubbery pinnipeds have historically been abundant throughout the
Canadian Arctic and are considered a critical prey species forpolar
bears.

During the winter, when snow falls heavily on the sea ice, ringed seals
dig out birth lairs in drifts above their breathing holes. This provides
protection from bears. When spring comes, the ringed seals birth their
pups in these lairs. But without deep snow and ice --- an increasingly
more common condition in a warming Arctic --- ringed seals can't protect
their vulnerable young. That may be why some Inuit communities, who hunt
the animals, say they've witnessed a decline in the seal's numbers in
recent years.

Likewise, the loss of sea ice is driving polar bears onto land where
they can no longer access the seals. In a recent study, scientists
examined the energy needs of polar bears forced ashore, determining that
they would need to consume approximately 1.5 caribou, 37 Arctic char, 74
snow geese, 217 snow goose eggs, or 3 million crowberries to even come
close to the energy provided by the blubber of a single adult ringed
seal.

The polar bears have been expending far more energy searching for food
now than when the sea was in its 'normal' state. It's going to be almost
impossible for polar bears to adapt to life on land as the Arctic sea
ice melts out.

Scientists estimate that all but a few polar bear populations will
likely be gone by 2100. The animals will only likely persist in the
Queen Elizabeth Islands --- the northernmost part of the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago --- and still roam into the Central Arctic Basin past
century's end.

Narwhals, the so-called unicorns of the sea, are also struggling.
Reliable breathing holes are harder to come by due to unpredictable
shifts in mobile sea ice. This has led to instances of the marine
mammals becoming trapped and dying under the ice.

"Anything that requires ice as a home, or a platform to hunt from, is
going to start doing worse," says Stanford's Arrigo. But other
transitory species, like gray whales, which feed off the productive
bottom, could do really well as the Arctic becomes more productive.

"A lot of species are going to be coming in from far away," he adds.
"But that's one of the scary things about all this. If they don't time
it correctly, and the Arctic's productivity happens a month earlier, the
migratory species coming in from the Southern Hemisphere will struggle.
There's a hard limit," he says. In a biome as harsh as the Arctic,
there's little room for error.

So, what to do?

In 2018, [ten parties signed an **international agreement** to prevent
**unregulated** **commercial fishing** in the Central Arctic Ocean until
**scientists** have a better]{.underline} [**understanding** of the
**profound regime shifts** underway]{.underline}. [The agreement
will]{.underline} also take into account Indigenous and local knowledge;
[foster **scientific cooperation**;]{.underline} [and establish
**conservation** and **management** measures before any fishing is
permitted to occur in the **vulnerable region**.]{.underline}

Once all parties have ratified the agreement it will remain in place for
16 years, subject to automatic renewal if all parties agree. As of 2021,
nine out of 10 parties have ratified the agreement, including the United
States, Japan, Russia, and the European Union. Only China has yet to
finalize its participation, irking some governments.

When asked by Mongabay about the delay at a policy forum in February,
Gao Feng, China's special representative for Arctic Affairs, noted that
the agreement was a milestone achievement and insisted that China "has
no political obstacle for the final approval. The only matter is time
and our internal procedure."

Though the climate change planetary boundary may have been crossed
globally, [[rapid **international action**]{.mark} [could curb]{.mark}
the **worst [biodiversity catastrophes]{.mark}** [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**tropics** and

to]{.underline} [help safeguard the world's **flora** and
**fauna**]{.underline}, as highlighted by the Central Arctic Ocean

### Advantage\-\--Resources\-\--1AC

#### The race for Arctic [resources]{.underline} is on, but the US is [set]{.underline} to be [left out]{.underline} because we lack the ability to [build]{.underline} new icebreakers. 

Rana **Foroohar 25**. American author, business columnist and an

Guard on the new Arctic front lines.\" Financial Times. 2-8-2025.

There is one other thing in Nome: the United States Coast Guard. This is
the branch of the American military that polices the country's waters
for everything from drug trafficking and illegal fishing to Russian and
Chinese spying. The Coast Guard does lots of other things too, like
rescue distressed vessels or people, chart new shipping pathways and
facilitate scientific research. I'm here to board the USCGC Healy, an
"icebreaker" that can navigate through ice nearly 5ft thick. [[Of the
Coast Guard's]{.mark} fleet]{.underline} [of [241]{.mark} active
"[cutters]{.mark}",]{.underline} which are ships 65ft in length or
greater, **[[only]{.mark} [two]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.underline}
**[icebreakers]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[The fact that the US has so few is the reason I'm here.]{.underline}
[[These ships are crucial to]{.mark} **[exploring]{.mark}** and
**protecting [the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which is fast becoming
one of the most hotly]{.underline} [contested places on
earth]{.underline} (and that was well before Donald Trump suggested
buying Greenland). But [[the]{.mark} [US hasn't **built** a **new
icebreaker**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [**quarter** of a
**century**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In **fact, it can't**.]{.underline}
[Thanks to the dramatic shrinking of the commercial shipping
industry,]{.underline} [the country is **incapable** of **efficiently**
producing **vessels** like this on its own. [The most recent effort is
five **years behind schedule** and **wildly over
budget**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The **desperate need** for ships is a **rare point** of **bipartisan
agreement**]{.underline}. The Biden administration signed a deal with
Finland and Canada to jointly produce more icebreakers. But the idea was
actually first floated by Trump during his first term. Now, his National
Security Council will push forward the "ICE Pact deal", bringing Finnish
engineering expertise to the US with the aim of building considerably
more icebreakers for the US and its allies over the next 10 years. The
bipartisan Ships for America Act, which offers support for America's
shipbuilders, was introduced last December and co-written by former
Congressmen Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security adviser.

"The president and I understand the economic and national security
importance of a strong US maritime industrial base," Waltz told the FT.
"The president understands the strategic need to revitalise our
commercial maritime industry and invest in additional US icebreaking
capabilities." Waltz said [there would be a "whole-of-government effort
to get]{.underline} [ships on the **water** as **quickly** as
**possible**]{.underline} \[[that\] will include]{.underline} putting
forth [a]{.underline}n emergency [request to **Congress** for
**funding**.]{.underline} We will remove any constraints that prevent US
shipbuilders from delivering vessels on time and on budget and, when
necessary, work with our allies to ensure we have the ships we need."

[**[Trump's]{.underline}** [interest]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
Arctic]{.underline} [is]{.underline}n't only martial, it's
[commercial]{.underline}. [Global warming [has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[led to **melting polar ice caps**]{.underline}, [opening up **new sea
lanes**]{.underline} [that could]{.underline}]{.mark} [[halve]{.mark}
[transit times]{.mark} between **Asia** and **Atlantic
ports**]{.underline}. Currently, the best sea lane is along Russia's
northern coastline, which it claims as its own. But [new passages
in]{.underline} [international waters would in effect **redraft** the
**blueprints** for **global supply chains,**]{.underline} [mitigating
the effects of **conflict** and **accidents** at **choke points**, such
as in the South China Sea and the Panama and **Suez
canals**.]{.underline}

[[Less polar ice also means easier access to]{.mark} sea beds, where
there are huge [reserves]{.mark} [of **rare earth
minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[oil]{.underline}** [and **natural
gas**]{.underline}. [Competition between the US, Russia,]{.underline}
[China and other nations to see who will claim and tap those resources
began years]{.underline} [ago]{.underline}. That also means the Arctic
is increasingly becoming a zone of military and espionage operation.
[This growing list of reasons means [the **Arctic** is about to get a
lot **more attention**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The plan solves. A [nuclear-powered]{.underline} icebreaking capability is the [key]{.underline} to [unlocking]{.underline} Arctic resources.

[The changing Arctic landscape will have enormous
consequences]{.underline} [within the realm of]{.underline}
[international affairs over the next century]{.underline}. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
unequipped]{.mark} and]{.underline} [**unprepared** for such
**changes**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} currently [lacks]{.mark} the
[**urgency** needed to address]{.mark} [this **strategic
vulnerability**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The world\'s northern Arctic waterways are more navigable than ever
before. Surveys during the Arctic\'s warm season show that total ice
coverage has decreased from an average of 3million square miles thirty
years ago to around 1.9 million square miles today.\[i\] [[This]{.mark}
changing scenario]{.underline}, [along with the preparation of **other
sovereign states**]{.underline} [that lay claim to **Arctic
regions**]{.underline}, [[requires that the US heavily]{.mark}
[**invest** in Arctic **research**, **resource
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the US Coast Guard, and the US Navy.
Given recent budget proposals and current trends, the funds allocated to
such segments within the US government fails to initiate such growth and
scarcely maintain levels of sustainability.

Over the next decade, Arctic waterways are projected to become even more
accessible than current levels: The open water season of the Bering
Strait (the 51 mile gap between Alaska and Russia) will grow from 23
weeks to 27 weeks), the Northern Sea route\'s open water season
(following the northern border of Russia and Norway) will grow from four
weeks to nine weeks, and the Northwest Passage (which guides along
Canada and west of Greenland) will be a new open water region and will
remain open for five weeks during the year.\[ii\]

[Such an opening of the Arctic\'s waters has unveiled one of the
**earth\'s largest reserves** of **valuable resources**]{.underline}. It
is estimated to have around 13% of the world\'s oil reserves and 30
percent of its natural gas reserves.\[iii\] To compare with a well-known
source of oil already established, Saudi Arabia has 21 percent of the
world's proven oil.ix These initial surveys have only been able to
capture \"conventional\" energy resource extraction, not the new
innovative extraction methods involving shale rock.\[iv\]

[Alaska\'s]{.underline} [continental shelf]{.underline}, which reaches
approximately 600 miles into the Arctic Ocean, [contains an estimated
**one third** of the **oil** and around **18% of all natural gas**
within the **Arctic**.\[]{.underline}v\]\'\[vi\] [The only comparable
region in terms of oil and natural gas probability is Russia\'s
**Western Siberian Basin**]{.underline}.\[vii\]It is of significant
importance that 84% of all oil and natural gas potential in the Arctic
remains offshore.\[viii\] While the Arctic waterways are becoming more
accessible during a couple warm months out of the year, most of the
time, it is a frozen ocean with a labyrinth of ice.

In addition to the oil and natural gas resources within its domain, the
[[Arctic also holds]{.underline} **[massive
deposits]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[of **rare earth minerals**]{.mark}
estimated at **\$1 trillion**]{.underline}.iii [[Most **electronic
components**]{.mark} [are made with]{.mark} some **element** of **[rare
earth minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Northwest Alaska houses the
largest known zinc mine; Russia\'s Western Siberia region is home to
vast quantities of nickel, palladium, and copper; and Canada\'s Baffin
Island sits on one of the largest deposits of iron-ore.\[ix\]

Beyond the vast array of resources within the Arctic, it is also of
strategic importance in terms of maritime traffic. Using the Arctic
waterways to transport from Northern Europe to the US West Coast could
reduce transportation costs by 20%.ix The Arctic\'s Northern Sea Route,
which connects Europe and Asia, would reduce travel time by 27%. With
more accessible summer sea lanes, traffic is already increasing. From
2010 to 2013, vessels through the Northern Sea Route went from 4 to
71,\[x\] and from 2005 to 2012, the Bering Strait saw an increase of 50%
in transports.viii

[[The **key**]{.mark} [which **unlocks access**]{.mark} [to all of the
**Arctic\'s resources**]{.mark} and **transport lanes** [is]{.mark} a
massive specialized ship: **[The Icebreaker]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Medium icebreakers can break ice as thick as 8 feet and can also crush
4.5 feet of ice while maintaining a constant speed of three knots
(3.5mph). Heavy icebreakers can break up to 21 feet of ice and can also
break 6 feet of ice while cruising at three knots.\[xi\] Arctic highways
are continually being opened, but after some time, freeze closed once
again. [[Maintaining any]{.mark} **sustainable [operations]{.mark}**
within such waters [requires the]{.mark} **all-important
[icebreaker]{.mark} vessel.**]{.underline}

Some Arctic powers have long understood the importance of the region.
Around one fifth of Russia\'s current economy is connected to those
areas within the Arctic Circle.iii They have already begun oil and
natural gas production within the Western Siberia region and have also
begun shipping oil from new offshore terminals.ix Gazprom, Russia\'s
largest natural gas organization, has already commenced resource
development within the Arctic\'s Barents Sea.ix

Such recognition of the Arctic\'s resource potential has provoked
Russian expansionism into its northern waters. In 2001, Russia
petitioned an international body to have their national sovereignty
recognized as far as the North Pole, an issue which remains
pending.\[xii\]Six years later, a Russian Arctic scientist mounted a
Russian flag just beneath the North Pole.\[xiii\] His response to
international criticism was not tailored to the politically sensitive
ear, \"I don\'t give a damn what all these foreign politicians there are
saying about this\...If someone doesn\'t like this, let them go down
themselves\...and then try to put something there. Russia must win.
Russia has what it takes to win. The Arctic has always been
Russian.\"xiii

While the US is concerned with maintaining open economic transportation
throughout the world\'s waterways, Russian official policy declares that
the Arctic\'s Northern Sea Route is a \"unified transportation link of
the Russian Federation.\" In 2009, they went one step further to
announce that they are planning to extract a \"fair price\" toll to pass
through the route. In the following year, official legislation was
developed to begin establishing the details of regulation and collection
of such tolls.xii

To enforce such ambitious claims, Russia is well-positioned in terms of
Arctic capabilities and logistics. They own eight heavy icebreakers,
seven of which are nuclear powered, and twenty-three medium
icebreakers.\[xiv\] Of the eleven additional icebreakers in development,
Russia has two scheduled to be released within the next couple
years.\[xv\]\'xvi Such a fleet of icebreakers is unmatched by any other
nation.

To supplement their ability to access Arctic waterways, Russia has also
been increasing its military capabilities for the region. Over the last
two years, Russia established fourteen new airfields and sixteen new
deep water ports; and has activated some of the most advanced
surface-to-air missiles in the region. Of the six most recent combat
brigades Russia has established, four of them are dedicated to the
Arctic.\[xvi\]More recently, Russia opened their second military base in
the region.\[xvii\] Its official purpose is to maintain control of
vessels passing through the Northern Sea Route, protect oil and natural
gas resources, and defend against possible attacks by a foreign
military.\[xviii\] Also in production by the Russians are two
ice-capable naval vessels which are armed with cruise missiles.\[xix\]
These developments have fulfilled Russian intentions that were announced
in 2014, \"We will be almost fully prepared to meet unwelcome guests
from east and north.\"\[xx\]Such extensive capabilities position Russia
as the preeminent Arctic power.

Activity within the region has already been heating up. In 2007, Russian
bombers entered the 12-mile air defense zone of Alaska at least 18
times.xii In 2014, more than 100 Russian reconnaissance flights were
recorded within the Arctic, up from around 33 from the prior year. On
the other side of the world, the Colonel General of the Russian Airforce
claimed that, \"In 2014, more than 140 \[US and UK reconnaissance\]
flights have taken place, compared to 22 flights in 2013.\"xx Not all
reconnaissance flights are hostile, but the increased frequency of
occurrences is a clear indication of perceived importance.

Russian activity within the region has reached beyond just research,
reconnaissance flights, and transportation. Military exercises have
commenced at an advanced level. In January 2015, around 3,000
intelligence officials were sent to a Russian air base within the Arctic
to listen in on Western communication channels.xx Two months later,
around 45,000 troops, 3,300 vehicles, 41 ships, 15 subs, and 110
aircraft arrived to conduct extensive military exercises.xvi

It is clear that the most powerful Arctic force is flaunting its
capabilities. Russia has the best fleet to maneuver across icy Arctic
waters. They\'ve established resource development, declared sovereignty
over one of the most widely used international Arctic waterways, and has
demonstrated its military might. The US Secretary of Defense succinctly
described the situation: \"The Arctic is key strategic terrain. Russia
is taking aggressive steps to increase its presence there.\"\[xxi\]

[If the **United States** became eager to establish its own
**dominance** within the Arctic **region**, it **would** be **unable**
to do so]{.underline}. Compared to Russia\'s 8 active heavy icebreakers,
the US has 1; while there are 23 active Russian medium icebreakers, the
US has none.\[xxii\] We\'re currently building no icebreakers and there
are no options to lease or borrow any icebreakers from \"legitimate\"
partners.xv [As the Arctic opens its vast strategic waterways and
abundant resources, the US can\'t **even produce** a series of
**navigable routes**.]{.underline}

The **[McMurdo]{.underline}** Antarctic Research Center [magnifies the
need for more US icebreakers]{.underline}. To initiate the resupply
process at McMurdo, a heavy icebreaker is required to break the 15 feet
of ice that surrounds the research center for 70 miles.xv This only
active US heavy icebreaker, at 41 years old, is aging and quite
deficient. Compared to the seven Russian nuclear powered icebreakers,
the one non-nuclear US icebreaker can spend only four to six days on
station before it must return.xii Such a desperate situation has caused
some to declare that current scientific observations are not sustainable
given the projected funding levels.\[xxiii\]

[[The]{.mark} **US [Coast Guard]{.mark}** [has asked for]{.mark} a
minimum of **[six icebreakers]{.mark}** that they say are needed for
**current operations**]{.underline} (at least three per pole: one
deployed, one within training, and one in long term
maintenance).xvi\'\[xxiv\] Despite this, the current funding proposal
aims to reduce the Coast Guard's budget around the same amount that is
required to build one new icebreaker.\[xxv\]\'\[xxvi\]

The situation is equally as dire when considering the current condition
of the US Navy. From a high of 594 ships in the 1980s, the current
deployable fleet of the US Navy is only 272 ships.\[xxvii\]\'\[xxviii\]
The official Naval Force Structure Assessment released in 2016
recommended a minimum fleet of 355 ships to cover modern strategic
points of interest.\[xxix\] A 350 ship navy only provides 70
continuously deployed vessels, given that training, transition, and
maintenance schedules usually occupy 4/5 of any current fleet. By
comparison, the Chinese Navy is estimated to reach 415 naval vessels by
2030.\[xxx\]

The current production schedules are set to have a total of 308 ships by
the end of 2021. Despite the fact that this shipbuilding plan fails to
reach the stated needs of the US Navy, current budget proposals fall
\$4.5 billion short of reaching the lackluster goal.xxvii Not only is
the US Navy unprepared to maintain coverage of their identified
strategic points of interest, there are no current plans to rectify the
situation.

There are extensive proposals to refit and refurbish decommissioned
naval vessels to help reach the 350 ship goal. Jerry Hendrix and Robert
C. O\'Brien\'s refurbish plan leaves only 22 new ships that would need
to hit the production line.\[xxxi\] Such an extensive refit and
refurbish plan would mirror methods used in the 1980s which brought the
US Navy to a total of 594 ships. However, there are doubts as to whether
this move would be prudent. Technology on decommissioned ships in the
1980s was not far off from the new requirements that were needed to be
protected on the open seas. The situation is quite different in 2017.
Current decommissioned ships are two, and sometimes three generations,
removed from current technology.xxxiv Even if the money was spent to
refit and refurbish these ancient vessels, the cost-benefit of such a
rebuild program could be seen as unsatisfactory, given that the extended
shelf life would be significantly shorter than producing a new vessel.

Other observers would like to fill the ship requirement gap with a
multitude of small, simple, less expensive vessels.\[xxxii\] While there
are openwater situations where fleets of small, fast moving vessels are
strategically beneficial, this different perspective does not address
the lack of traditional ships that the US Navy needs for their strategic
priorities. If production commenced for a new, small and fast fleet, it
should be in addition to the Navy\'s current stated needs, not as a
replacement.

Reaching such goals will be a challenge given the current financial
situation. Due to sequestration imposed upon military spending, the US
Navy needs an additional 23% of its current budget to return to normal
levels.\[xxxiii\]Expenses amount to around \$10 billion for a carrier,
\$3 billion each for submarines, \$2 billion for a destroyer, and \$500
million for the smaller Littoral Combat Ships.\[xxxiv\]\'\[xxxv\]
Estimates average around \$138 billion to achieve the 350 ship
goal.\[xxxvi\]\'\[xxxvii\]

Recent budget proposals released by the current administration are not
encouraging. Despite the fact that presidential campaign promises
included a Pentagon budget of \$640 billion, the current proposal for
the Pentagon is around \$575 billion, only 3% above the prior
administration\'s projected baseline.\[xxxviii\]\'\[xxxix\] While the US
Navy warns of a lack of ships, only 8 were earmarked for funding in the
current budget proposal, the same as the prior administration\'s
proposal.\[xl\] By comparison, China commissioned 18 naval vessels last
year. There are rumors of a couple other ships being added to the
funding lineup, but nothing yet has been confirmed.xxxv

Beyond fulfilling requirements for current needs, the US Navy is
especially unprepared for the opening Arctic waters. There are no active
ice-hardened combat ships.\[xli\] Without ice hardening, some Navy
vessels could withstand Arctic conditions in the summer, but only for a
few weeks, and only on the outside edges of ice barriers. No vessels
without ice hardening reinforcement can trail an icebreaker through a
newly carved path. When standard vessels are reinforced with Arctic
capable material, their deployable length can be extended from a few
weeks up to two months, but many problems and potential damage would
remain a concern.xli Refitting ice-hardened protective shells onto
existing vessels can cost an additional 33% of what it took to build the
ship itself.\[xlii\]

Building ice-capable ships during production is much easier and cost
efficient. Using production methods from Canada, Norway, and Denmark
(which maintains sovereignty over Greenland), it has been estimated that
an ice-capable Destroyer could be built with only 84% of current
production expenses.\[xliii\] Preparing our Navy for Arctic conditions
isn\'t a matter of ability; it is a matter of clearly and persuasively
communicating national priorities.

[[It is not enough to remain hopeful]{.mark} that [dwindling ice]{.mark}
during the Arctic\'s summer season [will allow **scientific
research**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[economic
transport]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and military might to flow freely
through the **Arctic\'s northern waters**]{.underline}. [Free movement
of vessels cannot be regulated to **small seasonal
windows**]{.underline}. Winter will come. Should an international
conflict arise in the Arctic, it will not be a chivalric standoff which
occurs a few weeks out of the year. It will be a year round conflict;
one which favors those who are prepared to maneuver and operate
throughout the thick and unrelenting ice.

The Constitutional blueprint for the US Federal Government reveals
within its first few lines that the national priorities are to \"provide
for the common defense", but only to \"promote the general
welfare".\[xliv\] With the multitude of requests for federal funding,
that founding document should be a continual reminder that national
defense preparedness is a unique imperative of the federal government.

[[**Investing** in at least **six** **new**]{.underline} **[nuclear
powered icebreakers]{.underline}**,]{.mark} allocating funding and
production schedules for a 350 ship Navy, [[and]{.mark} [announcing
intentions to maintain clear]{.mark} [passages]{.mark} for international
commercial waterways within the Arctic [should be of]{.mark}
**[paramount importance]{.mark}** for the United States]{.underline}.
[[**Such efforts** would]{.mark} [not be an]{.mark} **unnecessary
[escalation]{.mark}** [of **tensions** **within the
Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It would only be rectifying the years of
neglect and foolish policy that has prevented the **US** from
**protecting** the **vital resources** and **economic activity** within
its sphere]{.underline}. The changing Arctic waters reveal strategic
vulnerabilities that had once been below the radar, but now, cannot be
ignored.

#### Utilizing new reserves of critical minerals from [the Arctic]{.underline}, such as [rare earth elements]{.underline}, is necessary for the [transition]{.underline} towards [green technology]{.underline}. 

Mads Qvist **Frederiksen 23**. Executive director of the Arctic Economic
Council. \"If we want an energy transition, we must have more mining.\"
Arctic Economic Council. 3-13-2023.
https://arcticeconomiccouncil.com/news/if-we-want-an-energy-transition-we-must-have-more-mining/

[[The **demand** for **raw materials**]{.mark} is [expected to increase
by 500%]{.mark} [between now and]{.mark} [2050]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to the World Bank, due to the energy transition that the world
is going through.

There was a watershed moment in history when the earth was first "turned
inside out" and humans started to exploit the raw materials that make up
the primordial foundation of our planet. Today we once again look
underground for the solutions to our challenges.

[[In the **Arctic**]{.mark} **region**, we can [find **many**]{.mark}
[of the **metals**]{.mark} [and **minerals**]{.mark} [needed for
the]{.mark} **[green transition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On January 12th
2023, the Swedish mining company LKAB announced that around 700 meters
below the ground, they had discovered the largest known deposit of rare
earth elements in Europe -- a raw material that is it is critical for
our transition to new, green technologies but is not currently being
mined in Europe.

All across the Arctic, the local communities have for centuries been
involved in the mining sector. The region has been mined throughout
history to attain the building blocks for a more modern and developed
civilisation globally. Yet, people's understanding of the importance of
mining has decreased over time as new mines have been placed in remote
and distant locations with different regulatory frameworks than in the
Arctic. However, now the world needs Arctic mining again because the
region has many of the raw materials needed in the green transition and
in places with fair and transparent jurisdictions.

Politicians are awaking to the need of mining for a clean and greener
future

In early March 2023, the European Union (EU) published their new
Critical Raw Materials (CRM) Act. It may not have made a lot of
headlines around the world, but it is important for industries, remote
Arctic communities, and the wider population.

The president of the European Commission Ursula de Leyden highlighted
the importance of mining at the beginning of the year when she said:

"[[The economies of the future will no longer rely on]{.mark} [oil and
coal]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} on [lithium]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[batteries]{.mark}; on **[silicon]{.mark} metal** [for]{.mark}
[chips]{.mark}; on **[rare earth]{.mark} permanent [magnets]{.mark}**
[for **electric**]{.mark} [**vehicles** and **wind** turbines]{.mark}.
And it is sure: [the **green**]{.mark} and **digital
[transitions]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} **massively [increase]{.mark}**
[our **need for these materials**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Some analysts even argue that the opening of the first EU office in
Nuuk, Greenland is related to Europe waking up to its need for new
sources of raw materials.

Simultaneously in the US, President Biden earlier announced an increase
in the development of green technologies. The new Inflation Reduction
Act (IRA) also includes large tax breaks for mining companies that can
produce the required critical raw materials. Last year, the US also
launched a \$30 million initiative to research and secure the supply
chain of domestic raw materials.

Both the EU and the USA have recognised that they risk simply replacing
fossil fuel dependency to mineral dependency from authoritarian states
if they don't act now.

China -- who today is processing most of the world's raw materials and
thus holds a competitive advantage, is also moving into new mining
regions such as Madagascar and deep-sea mining off the coast of
Mozambique. Some Chinese companies have also shown an interest in mining
projects throughout the Arctic region.

[Mining has become an **issue** of **security** but it is also just as
much about the future of **planetary health**]{.underline}; t[he
unavoidable fact is that our sustainable future begins deep underground
in a mine.]{.underline} Yet, there were no references to mining in the
most recent report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

[We cannot afford to slow down with **mining**]{.underline}. It is clear
that [we are going to need a vast amount of **[green energy]{.mark}** in
the future]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} for that, [we [will need a
vast amount of **critical minerals**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the coming two decades, we will require a 500% increase in the
production of lithium and graphite in order to meet demand. Some people
estimate that our activity will necessitate the opening of more than 330
new mines in the near future, and with one mine normally taking more
than 15 years to become operational, we have no time to waste.

We need to invest more in new mining projects

[Today's **mineral supply** and investment plans fall short of what is
needed to transform our **energy sector**]{.underline}. A [growing and
more resource-hungry population means larger quantities of CO2 emissions
unless we are able to change our basic technologies.]{.underline}

If you want to build a battery to store energy, you need lithium,
nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite to ensure high performance,
longevity and, energy density.

If you want to expand your electricity network, you need copper and
aluminium.

If you want to build permanent magnets that are used in wind turbines
and electric vehicles, you need rare earth elements.

In 2019, Finnish geologist Simon Michaux estimated that the world has to
increase the production of several raw materials several times, above
all total historical production to date, to reach our climate ambitions.
Therefore recycling will not take us all the way.

A typical electric car requires six times more mineral inputs than a
conventional car, and an onshore wind turbine requires nine times more
minerals than a gas-fired plant of the same capacity. Since 2010, the
average amount of minerals required for a new unit of power generation
capacity has increased by 50%.

[It is also the critical raw materials which we need in our satellites,
computers, and **connectivity infrastructure**]{.underline}. [The
defence industry also needs the minerals that we are currently
**sourcing** from **authoritarian states**]{.underline}. Each F-35 jet
contains more than 400 kilos of yttrium, terbium, and other rare earth
elements. Nuclear reactors and lasers use samarium, missile guidance
systems need neodymium, night vision goggles need lanthanum, etc. In the
autumn of 2022, the Pentagon temporarily halted deliveries of F-35 jets
after discovering that the raw materials used for a magnet had been made
with a cobalt and samarium alloy from China. As such, they had to find a
place closer to home in their supply chain. Today, the majority of rare
earth mining, refining, and processing takes place in China.

In 2010, China and Japan entered a trade dispute when the former
suddenly halted all shipments of rare earth elements to Japan. The
dispute began when the Chinese government reduced its export quotas by
40% which resulted in import prices rising quickly. China argued that
this decision was made to protect the environment, but the West called
it protectionism in disguise. The dispute was later resolved in the WTO,
but it caused western governments to begin looking outside of China for
rare earth elements.

For the climate, for security, and for jobs

As we can see, [we [must diversify our **raw materials**]{.mark}
[supply]{.mark} and develop mining]{.underline} [operations in **new
places**, instead of outsourcing to developing countries. [The **Arctic
region** contains **many**]{.mark} of the **[minerals]{.mark}** that are
[currently mined elsewhere]{.mark}, even though [the]{.mark}
[**quality** of the **ore**]{.mark} [could **possibly be better in the
north.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

We cannot get anywhere close to the quantity of required raw materials
in a sustainable manner unless developed countries are also pursuing
mining opportunities.

The good news is that there is growing consumer demand for more supply
chain transparency, tighter environmental regulations, and labour
rights. This, combined with the strategic importance, may lead to more
mining in the Arctic. The first obstacle to overcome is the idea of
"NIMBY -- not in my backyard" or "Green colonialism" which some interest
groups are promoting. Some of the interest groups don't even live in the
front yard of the Arctic but believe that the region should be kept
separate from wider global development.

[I believe that when presented with the options of where and how
[mining]{.mark} takes place today, and how it [**could take place** in
the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this information could bring more
people together. Local communities ultimately benefit from having a mine
close-by. They create new jobs and the supply and demand for supporting
services. In some parts of the Arctic, it is the mining companies that
construct and develop the infrastructure to improve the lives in the
north. For example, through investment in schools and renewable energy.

It was the demand for metal that drove industrialization from
approximately 1700 to 1900, followed by the demand of new infrastructure
and two world wars which led to the development of modern materials.
Subsequently, the growth of big science and high-tech, combined with the
rise of China from early 2000 has resulted in not only an exponential
increase in energy demand but also in the demand for minerals.

The production of copper, zinc and steel has escalated drastically in
the past 50 years. By 2030, the 20 million project EV charging points,
that are anticipated globally, will consume 250% more copper than
produced today. Wood Mackenzie estimated in 2022 that 9.7 million tonnes
(Mt) of new copper supply is needed over 10 years from projects yet to
be sanctioned, equivalent to nearly a third of current refined
consumption, if industry is to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets.
They also estimate that more than US\$23 billion a year will be called
for over 30 years, to deliver new projects under an accelerated energy
transition scenario.

According to World Bank study from 2017, [[we need to increase]{.mark}
our [production]{.mark} [of]{.mark} nickel by 100%, indium by **more
than 200%**, and **cobalt**, **[lithium]{.mark}** and **graphite** [by
more than 450%]{.mark} no later than 2050 in order [to reach our climate
targets.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The challenge is now that we have mined our way through history, so the
quality -- or the grade -- of the minerals is getting worse at the
surface. We must dig deeper to retrieve useful material. We must also
use new and innovative methods to find "hidden" or "blind" deposits.

Another challenge we face is that 50 years we did not mine for many of
these critical minerals and as such some rocks containing key materials
were not processed correctly and ended up in tailings piles.
Consequently, our understanding of, and current mining practices around
these metals, is poor in comparison to others. Therefore we need to
increase exploration for these critical raw materials. This is where the
Arctic region can come in to help.

The Arctic got the opportunities to be a prime area for mining

The solution to the supply problem is relatively straightforward. We can
either mine more, recycle better, or massively reduce our consumption.
The main challenge with the latter solution is that many of the elements
used in modern devices were not used in older products. And that the
amounts we need are greater than historically mined. For just copper, we
use four times more of it in an electric car than in an internal
combustion engine.

Therefore, we need to mine.

There is a saying, when is the right time to plant a tree? The answer is
yesterday, but when is the second-best time? And the answer is today.
The same goes for mining. We should have started to invest a long time
ago but we can still make it if we start today.

[First the good news, we don't lack the raw materials.]{.underline} [In
fact, for example, the so-called rare earth **elements** are not **very
rare at all**]{.underline}. [What we lack is **robust finance** for
**mining**]{.underline}, quicker permitting, and customers who are
willing to pay a premium for more responsible mining.

While mining activities have been undertaken for thousands of years, the
**[mining]{.underline}** industry [in the Arctic is moving towards
**maximum benefits** with **minimum impact.**]{.underline} Whilst
**[mining]{.underline}** by its nature is not sustainable, it [can be
responsible]{.underline}. [The **latest technologies** in **mining** can
help to mitigate and minimize **environmental** and **societal
impacts**.]{.underline}

Some of the main obstacles facing mining are the absolutist anti-mining
positions taken by some interest groups and well-meaning forces in the
developed world. However, these harsh line policies can often result in
the opposite outcome in regard to biodiversity and global impact. As
without support we instead experience a "mining leakage" where the
projects don't disappear but are instead shifted to faraway places.
Mines are shifted from nations with benign practices, strict human
rights, and environmental regulations to regions with less stringent
social and environmental policies.

#### The Arctic is [key]{.underline}. It can meet a [quarter]{.underline} of global demand for [critical minerals]{.underline} needed for [green tech]{.underline}.

The Arctic is warming almost four times faster than the global average,
transforming the frozen landscape at an astonishing rate. While
devastating for wildlife and communities that live there, governments
and businesses spy an opportunity.

[[The **region is rich in resources**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[including]{.mark} untapped [fossil fuel reserves and
**critical**]{.mark} **[minerals necessary]{.mark}** [for the]{.mark}
**energy [transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Arctic nations have
jostled for control of these **resources** for **decades**, and **[some
exploitation]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- mostly fossil fuel extraction in
the Russian Arctic -- [[is]{.mark} already
[underway]{.mark}.]{.underline}

By the end of the decade, the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free during the
summer, allowing ships to journey directly over the North Pole for the
first time. This rapid melt is making the region more accessible than
ever, fuelling expectations of fast industrial growth in the Arctic.
Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump has loudly
declared his desire to take over Greenland, a Danish territory, as well
as Canada. But will climate change really deliver an Arctic industrial
boom?

[There is no doubt the region harbours **valuable
resources**]{.underline}, including about 90 billion barrels' worth of
oil and about 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas
reserves, according to a 2012 assessment by the US Geological Survey.

[**[Rare earth minerals]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} also
**[plentiful]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Greenland]{.mark} [alone]{.mark}
is thought to [have enough]{.mark} reserves of [metals such as
**neodymium**]{.mark} [and **dysprosium**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which

[dominates]{.mark} global [supply chains]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} other
regions -- **most notably [Europe]{.mark}** -- [racing to **secure
alternative supplies**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

"[There is increased interest from mining companies]{.underline},
multinational mining companies, for exploring and mapping the deposits
in the Arctic, [due to the need for particularly **critical raw
materials** in **Europe**,]{.underline}" says Anne Merrild at Aalborg
University in Denmark.

Almost 80% of the global population lives in countries that are net
importers of fossil fuels (IRENAd, 2022). [Due to their [dependence
on]{.mark} foreign [fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}, approximately six
billion [people are [vulnerable to]{.mark} geopolitical **[shocks and
crises]{.mark}**]{.underline} (AaH et al., 2021). In contrast,
[[renewable]{.mark} energy sources are available in all nations, but
their **[full potential]{.mark} has [yet to be
realized]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The International Renewable Energy
Agency (IRENA) estimates that [by 2050, 90% of the world\'s energy can
and should come from renewable sources]{.underline} (IRENAb, 2018).

In addition, the [[excessive use of fossil fuels]{.mark} and
nonrenewable energy sources [contributes]{.mark} [to global warming by
emitting]{.mark} large quantities of [greenhouse
gases]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chen et al., 2022a). [[Controlling]{.mark}
greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark} from energy production and consumption
is [**crucial** to]{.mark} **[combating climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To achieve the Paris Agreement\'s goal of
limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 °C--2 °C by 2100,
[[energy]{.mark} systems [require **rapid**, **immediate**]{.mark}, and
[**sustained innovation** and]{.mark} the [**effective use of renewable
energy** across all sectors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fawzy et al., 2020).
The demand and growth of renewable energy in the transportation,
buildings, industrial, and power sectors are summarized in Table 1 based
on the critical energy use sectors identifed by the IRENA.

The [**[urgency]{.underline}** [to **combat climate
change**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and [achieve **sustainable development**
strengthens]{.mark} the global renewable **[energy transition]{.mark}**
momentum in an era of global environmental degradation.]{.underline} A
[**[sustainable energy future]{.mark}** is **[within reach]{.mark}**
[due to]{.mark} the development of **[green buildings]{.mark}**,
**[green energy]{.mark}** [and **power use**]{.mark} in **industry**,
[green]{.mark} **[transportation]{.mark}**, [decreased costs of
**renewable energy**]{.mark}, increased energy efficiency and continued
**technological advancements**, and informed policymaking.]{.underline}
This [shift is gaining traction, [but]{.mark} it **[must
accelerate]{.mark}** to contribute to global sustainable
development.]{.underline} According to the development and research on
the use of renewable energy in critical sectors (Table 1), the building
sector accounts for 70% of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\'s energy
consumption. In order to sustain the construction industry, renewable
energy is essential. However, the [development of renewable energy is
hindered by policies, fnances, technology, and culture]{.underline}. In
addition, India\'s urgent need for policies promoting the use of
renewable energy in the construction industry was demonstrated.
According to studies, [using [renewable]{.mark} [energy]{.mark} in the
industrial sector can **[save money]{.mark}** and **[protect]{.mark} the
[environment]{.mark}** from the dangers of fossil fuel
emissions]{.underline}. However, government level awareness campaigns
regarding the significance of energy conservation are required.

[[constitute a **global**]{.mark} [**threat** to
**civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} **continued [human

outcomes]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [even **[existential

biodiversity]{.underline} at local to regional scales **[[are
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly in the absence of risk
management interventions.

From the assessment presented in this chapter, we see four key pathways
by which [**[climate change]{.underline}** [could]{.underline}]{.mark}
[trigger [**global catastrophe**:]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [[rapid acceleration in]{.mark} the use of **[fossil fuel]{.mark}
production** and **use**:]{.underline} This [could
[make]{.mark}]{.underline} [**more-pessimistic** **scenarios** of
**[future emissions likelier]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [thus increasing
the likelihood of Earth **[reaching magnitudes]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**global [warming consistent]{.mark}** [with more-**catastrophic
outcomes**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [the Earth system's increased **sensitivity** to **changes in
climate**]{.underline}: Although current estimates put the world on
track for 2 to 3°C of warming by 2100 under current policy trajectories,
[**positive feedback** could push the **world** to **higher levels of
warming**.]{.underline}

• reductions in thresholds for key risks in the Earth system: In the
event that large-scale discontinuities in the Earth system, such as the
collapse of ice sheets or major ecosystems, are triggered by lower
magnitudes of warming than currently estimated, the risk of global
catastrophic outcomes would increase.

• [cascading and compounded risks]{.underline}: [[Climate
change]{.mark}'s ability to trigger complex]{.underline} [consequences
that are not captured in existing, reductionist studies [could result in
**surprise catastrophic events** or **contribute** to **other types** of
**existential threats**, such as **global
pandemics**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Critical Minerals Agreement with Norway, demonstrating both countries'
commitment to working together to ensure energy security.31) Another
such opportunity for the U.S. to further support its Nordic Allies
exists in Sweden. In 2024 the Swedish mining company LKAP discovered
Europe's largest deposit of rare earth elements in the northern city of
Kiruna, Sweden. Norway and Sweden have already begun collaborating to
increase energy security through the Norwegian company, REETec, which
has developed technology to separate rare earth metals that competes
with China's production of these materials.32) According to the CEO of
LKAB, Jan Moström, this cooperation provides the foundation to develop a
"strong and sustainable Nordic value chain for rare earth metals."33[)

But before we even get to that very worst of the worst-case scenarios of
a direct collision between a NATO ally and Russia, [[even]{.mark} the
**[slight]{.mark}est [escalation]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the

more [prescient]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This carries with it both
advantages and disadvantages. Traditionally, NATO military forces have
relied on critical civilian infrastructure such as communications, food
and water, industrial capacity, civil transport and energy supplies to
conduct operations. The additional rise of non-kinetic asymmetric
threats -- cyberwarfare, information warfare, EMP attack -- against
non-traditional targets, such as banks or major multinational
corporations that comprise key components of this critical
infrastructure, adds an entirely new dimension to the defense
requirements of the 21st century. In addition to dealing with more
conventional kinetic threats from traditional and emerging adversaries,
NATO must prepare itself for this new era of invisible warfare through
deeper strategic cooperation with the private sector and corporate
entities. [Great Powers and non-state actors [alike]{.mark} can now

## Shipbuilding Advantage

### Shipbuilding\-\--AT: Aff Can't Solve\-\--2AC

#### Sustained focus on icebreakers is necessary to [actualize]{.underline} federal investments in shipbuilding.

[**Thus** far **[procurement]{.mark}** and lead-up to
construction]{.underline} [of the Polar Security Cutter]{.underline},
[as the Coast Guard's **new heavy icebreaker** is called, [has been
**anything but smooth**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with more than half a
decade passing from contract signing to the first steel being cut.

[**But** [a **clear signal** from the **U.S. government** for the
**procurement** of a **fleet** of]{.mark} **[icebreakers]{.mark}** in
the **present [can help put American shipyards]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[in a position to]{.mark} [participate]{.mark} [in the market for a
growing **global demand** of **icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline} --
[estimated between **70-90 -- in the future**]{.underline}. [And in the
[medium-term]{.mark} that new [expertise]{.mark} could]{.underline}
[[translate to **competing** for **international**]{.mark} military and
**[commercial dual-purpose vessels.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

President Trump recently stated that the U.S. will be looking to order
40 big icebreakers for the Coast Guard. [[**Even** a firm **commitment**
and **funding** for a fraction of this **lofty goal** would send a **key
signal**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"[**[Sustained U.S. government focus]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the
**production** of **vessels** like
**[icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, undersea construction vessels,
unmanned underwater vehicles, and undersea cable and repair ships
[[remains the **clearest route**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} putting near-term
'**[points on-the-board]{.mark}**]{.underline}," the Wilson Center
report highlights.

"[The **best tool** we have today to **strengthen** the **shipbuilding
industrial base** in America]{.underline} **[is
procurement]{.underline}**, but we also need new government investment,
adjustment to trade policy, and changes in labor policy. We need to
force military service branches to think about industrial policy --- not
just following bureaucratic procedures to put warships on the water,"
Henagan concludes.

https://www.arctictoday.com/can-new-u-s-icebreakers-help-break-chinas-shipbuilding-dominance/

[[Why icebreakers?]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Wilson Center argues that [[**icebreakers** are a **critical
starting point** for reviving]{.mark} [U.S.
**shipbuilding**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the U.S. has only a handful
of operational icebreakers, Russia has over 40 in service, and China
continues expanding its polar fleet.

Beyond military needs, [[**global demand** for **icebreakers** is
**growing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[with]{.mark} U.S. [allies]{.mark}
[projected to purchase between **70 and 90
icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the next decade. [[If U.S.
shipyards]{.mark} can **scale up production** and **[compete
internationally]{.mark}**, [they could **break** into a growing
**market** and **re-establish America's reputation** as a **global
shipbuilder**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The ICE Pact, a trilateral initiative with Finland and Canada, is
designed to help U.S. shipyards enter this market while strengthening
Arctic security. If successful, [[it could serve]{.underline} [as a
model for **larger-scale** U.S. **shipbuilding
reforms**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A call to action

The Wilson Center's report presents a stark warning: [Without urgent
reforms, the U.S. will continue to fall further **behind** in
**shipbuilding capacity**]{.underline}, [**industrial competitiveness**
and **Arctic security**.]{.underline}

By developing a national shipbuilding strategy, modernizing acquisition
rules, and implementing stronger trade protections, the U.S. can rebuild
its maritime power and compete with China's state-backed shipbuilding
dominance.

### Shipbuilding\-\--AT: ICE Pact Solves\-\--2AC

#### The ICE Pact fails to rebuild shipbuilding.

Most importantly, [[the US has **failed** to **build up** its **domestic
icebreaker capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, nor has it begun developing
related naval capabilities that would allow it to actively contest and
contain the rapid Russian and Chinese buildup along the Arctic sea
lanes.

And it has done remarkably little, until lately, to support its friends
in the Arctic with respect to infrastructure investment support. The US,
for example, has no Arctic deepwater ports to host heavy container
ships. Canada has only one, lying 500 miles south of the Arctic Circle.

[Even though Russia now has over 40 icebreakers]{.underline}, **[several
of nuclear-powered]{.underline}**, and an active building program, [the
United States presently lacks even a single heavy or **medium-duty
icebreaker** active in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. US icebreaker
capacity, such as it is, is concentrated entirely in the Great Lakes.

## Resources Advantage

### Resources\-\--AT: Minerals Not Key\-\--2AC

#### Exploiting [every source]{.underline} of minerals is key to make the energy transition happen in the [short term.]{.underline}

Andrea **Willige 25**. Senior Writer. \"What are the critical minerals
for the energy transition -- and where can they be found?.\" World
Economic Forum. 5-13-2025.
https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/critical-minerals-energy-transition-supply-chain-challenges/

[[What are critical minerals, and why are they
important?]{.underline}]{.mark}

Although definitions vary, there are a large number of critical minerals
and rare earth elements that are important to the energy transition.
Sometimes they are referred to as "critical materials", extending to
metals like aluminium and other substances.

The US Department of Energy lists a total of 50 critical minerals, while
the European Union focuses on 34. The IEA's list of the most widely used
ones includes lithium, nickel, cobalt manganese and graphite, which are
typically used in batteries. Aluminium and copper are vital for
electricity networks, and rare earths are used for magnets in wind
turbines and electric car motors.

Some, like platinum, iridium and palladium are among the rarest elements
on Earth, while others like aluminium and silicon, are among the most
abundant elements on Earth.

[However, just [because they are **abundant** does]{.mark} [not mean
they are **easy to access**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example,
while copper is not a rare element, the typical lead time for a new mine
to start delivering copper to the market is about 20 years, according to
the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

That's why recycling will be a vital requirement for ensuring enough of
those critical resources are available. [The more of a material can be
recycled, the **less rare** it is going to **become**. What is more,
**recycling** will **reduce** the need to **extract more** and more from
the **ground**.]{.underline}

However, IRENA has pointed out that [as [demand for critical
minerals]{.mark} and materials [has]{.mark} [increased
rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}, [current [recycling]{.mark} technology and
infrastructure are [still lagging. Until recycling can play a bigger
role, we still **depend** heavily on **traditional extraction**]{.mark}
and the **associated value chain**]{.underline}[. [The question of where
**we source** critical minerals]{.underline}]{.mark} [therefore [remains
**vital** for **securing future supply chains**]{.mark} [as **demand**
grows.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Introduction

[It is believed that [the **Arctic North**]{.mark} of Russia
[contains]{.mark} approximately a quarter of the **world\'s oil
[reserves]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The **[extraction]{.mark}** of this
**reserves** is a [tough]{.mark} goal [due to severe]{.mark} [Arctic
conditions]{.mark} such as **extreme weather** and **thick ice
crusts**]{.underline}, which hinder the transportation of black gold to
the refineries. While the extraction of oil from that zone is only
projected in the future, the Northern Sea Route (Fig. 1) is currently
actively used by ships for scientific expedition and transportation of
goods. [[The only way to **navigate** through six to **ten foot thick
ice** is to use **powerful**]{.mark} **[icebreakers]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} can smash it and [**clear the path** for **other
ships**]{.mark}. While there is a number of **[conventional]{.mark}
diesel powered [icebreakers]{.mark}** used around the world, these [**do
not provide enough power** to be able to **crush thicker ice** and
require]{.mark} frequent **[refueling]{.mark}** which makes them
inconvenient for **long periods** of **continuous
operation**]{.underline}. \[1\] The nuclear icebreakers are designed to
solve these issues and provide a number of advantages compared to the
diesel powered icebreaker. [The only country that has been making and
using nuclear **powered icebreakers** is **Russia**]{.underline} (and
USSR in the past). \[2\] So far, Russia has built nine nuclear-powered
ice-breakers, six of which are currently in operation.

How It Works

Icebreakers have very smooth shaped bows, as opposed to pointed bows
used by regular ships designed to slice the waves and add stability in
open waters. When the icebreaker smashes ice the smooth bow hits the ice
first from the above and causes it to break under the massive weight of
the ship (Fig. 2). \[3\] The hull of the icebreaker is reinforced and
coated with low- friction compounds to facilitate gliding over ice.
Furthermore, the hull is designed push the crushed ice away from the
ship to keep the propulsion system safe.

[The heart of the ship contains a small nuclear reactor to generate heat
which is **converted** into **mechanical energy**]{.underline}. \[2\]
[The reactor can provide power up to 60]{.underline} megawatts which is
enough to get through 8-10 feet thick ice at speed up to 10 knots (12
mph). The reactor uses nuclear fuel such as highly enriched uranium or
uranium-zirconium to boil water that then rotates the turbine which, in
turn, powers the turbo electric drive system. The latter spins the
propeller. \[4\]

Advantages and Disadvantages

[**[Nuclear-powered icebreakers]{.mark}** [are **much more powerful**
than **diesel icebreaker.**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[That enables
them **propel through** very **thick crust of ice** at relatively fast
speed as **mentioned before**]{.underline}. [The fuel demands of this
task using any other source of fuel]{.underline} (such as diesel) [would
be enormous]{.underline}: approximately [90 metric tons of fuel a
day]{.underline} [compared to just one pound of **uranium at full
power**]{.underline} (for \"50 years of Victory\" icebreaker). [[The
**icebreakers** are]{.mark} [**usually refueled** once **every 5-7
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[2\] [[This provides an **enormous
cost**]{.mark} **[advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as well as
convenience of not depending on the **presence** of **ports** and
**refueling locations** at **remote areas**]{.underline}. Nonetheless,
the installation and maintenance of the nuclear propulsion system and
the fuel itself is quite costly.

### Resources\-\--AT: Warming Turn\-\--2AC

#### Breaking ice does not cause climate change. 

**AR 23**. Editors of the Arctic Review. \"Myths about icebreakers
create misleading perceptions of these ships.\" Arctic Review.
1-17-2023. https://arctic.review/papers/busting-myths-about-icebreakers/

A rounded bow allows for more efficient icebreaking and helps lift the
vessel up under pressure from ice. Broken ice is also directed under the
icebreaker through air and water systems. These and other measures
prevent broken ice from building up around the front of the ship and,
therefore, from slowing it down. [It is also important to stress that
[icebreakers]{.mark} [traverse ice-laden waters by **breaking
ice**]{.mark}, **[not by melting it]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[The common misconception]{.mark} [that **icebreakers** **contribute**
to "**global warming**" by]{.mark} **[melting ice]{.mark}**
[could]{.mark}, **therefore**, [**not be further from the
truth**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Oil and gas extraction from the Arctic will be limited. Other regions are cheaper.

offshore oil and gas production with climate change and the implications
for energy markets.\" PubMed Central (PMC). 3-20-2024.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10954641/

Our results suggest that climate change impacts on Arctic sea-ice
thickness will increase [[Arctic offshore oil]{.mark}
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}, though with that impact alone, it [is
[likely to remain a **small portion** of **total global**]{.mark} **[oil
production]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The climate impacts on
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} sea [ice on offshore natural gas
[extraction]{.mark} are **[likely to be limited]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[with production remaining low [due to the very low relative costs of
onshore natural gas extraction elsewhere in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among Arctic regions, changes in sea ice
thickness are likely to have the largest impacts on USA Arctic offshore
oil production, particularly for the Alaskan Platform AU. We find the
effects of human efforts to achieve a low-carbon future (LowC scenarios)
would increase Arctic offshore oil production, due to the simultaneous
effect of reduction in unconventional oil production and the gradual
depletion of non-Arctic crude oil over the century. [Nevertheless, in
the near term]{.underline} (before 2030), [neither the effects of
climate change-induced sea ice thinning nor low-carbon transition
scenarios are likely to cause expansion of Arctic offshore oil
production into new AUs]{.underline}. In addition, under the explored
scenarios, future **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** offshore **[[oil and
gas extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is not likely to **affect
prices** or **production** in the **broader** global **oil and gas
markets**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Resources\-\--AT: Warming Turn\-\--1AR

#### Even if massively scaled up, icebreakers would have a [miniscule]{.underline} impact on the climate. 

**NSIDC 23**. National Snow and Ice Data Center. \"Are icebreakers
changing the climate?.\" National Snow and Ice Data Center. 1-2-2023.
https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/are-icebreakers-changing-climate

[How much ice does an icebreaker break?]{.underline}

Meier decided to crunch some numbers and find out. While his numbers are
an estimate, they provide a helpful comparison of just how much
icebreakers might contribute to summer ice loss. Meier said, "In late
June, when the sun's energy is strongest, the total sea ice extent is
around 10 million square kilometers (3.9 million square miles). An
icebreaker cruising through the ice for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and
leaving an ice-free wake of 10 meters (33 feet) would open an area of
water 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) over the entire cruise. In
contrast, the Arctic sea ice cover decreases by an average of over 9
million square kilometers (3.5 million square miles) each year during
its melt season---an area larger than the contiguous United States.

[[Even as **icebreaker activity increases**]{.underline}]{.mark}---for
example, Russia maintains the world's largest fleet of more than 50
icebreakers in 2023 compared with fewer than 10 icebreakers a decade
ago---[these numbers **do not significantly change**]{.underline}. Many
of Russia's icebreakers are being used to escort ships through the
Northern Sea Route, and they tend to follow the same channel. This means
that even though there may be multiple icebreakers operating at the same
time, they are not breaking much new ice, which would only occur if the
ice drifted and blocked the channel. So, Meier said, "[[The actual
contribution is miniscule---only **one part in a million**]{.underline}
[of the **total ice cover**."]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Even if the amount]{.mark} of ice [broken **increased** by an **order
of magnitude**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [say from 10 square
kilometers]{.underline} (3.86 square miles) [of ice broken by a single
icebreaker [to **100** **square**]{.mark}
**[kilometers]{.mark}**]{.underline} (38.61 square miles) [of ice broken
by **10 icebreakers**]{.underline}, [[the amount of ice broken would
still be]{.mark} **[minuscule]{.mark}** [compared to the **vastness of
the Arctic Ocean**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [Because
[icebreakers]{.mark} have such a **minimal effect** on **sea ice**, they
also [have a **minimal effect on climate**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Oil and gas extraction in the Arctic is not economical.

Rebecca **Leber 23**. Senior reporter for Vox covering climate. \"The
oil industry's cynical gamble on Arctic drilling.\" Vox. 9-8-2023.
https://www.vox.com/climate/23863150/biden-arctic-drilling-big-oil

But [these advantages]{.underline} also [run up against major
barriers]{.underline} [that make oil development in the **Arctic
uniquely difficult**]{.underline} [--- challenges that have far more to
do with the **environment** there than **environmental
regulations**.]{.underline}

The industry aims to squeeze as much as possible out of the cheapest oil
reserves it has: areas that will produce a lot of oil for less cost.
[[The Arctic has oil, but it **doesn't come
cheaply**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[Companies]{.mark} have to [**contend**
with **frozen roads**]{.mark}, [**remote areas**,]{.mark} [and
**transporting**]{.mark} specialized **[rigs]{.mark}** [before even
**unearthing any oil**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even in a world without
environmental regulations, [[it]{.mark} simply **[costs]{.mark}** [more
for **oil companies** to drill]{.mark} there, ranking the risks of the
Arctic right alongside the risks of **deep-water drilling** and
operating in **politically** **unstable countries**]{.underline}.
Because of the expense, these are also long-term investments, from which
companies plan to benefit over the course of 30 to 40 years. This
introduces a lot more uncertainty because of the many factors that can
affect oil prices in that time.

[The **Willow Project** faces these **disadvantages** and
**more**]{.underline}. [Willow still faces legal challenges from
environmentalists]{.underline}, [but [the costs of **drilling**]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} also [gotten worse in]{.mark} **[other ways]{.mark}** ---
[**ironically**, **because of climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
example: ConocoPhillips has had to contend with melting permafrost at
the sites it intends to drill, which the company will try to neutralize
by installing giant chilling devices in the ground.

[For Arctic drilling to make sense economically]{.underline}, [a company
has to bank on prices at the pump remaining high and that consumer
demand will still be there for decades to come]{.underline}. That's [in
spite of]{.underline} [expectations]{.underline} [that EV sales will
**cut into demand** for **gasoline**]{.underline}, with EVs on track to
become half of global car sales by 2035.

Just to break even, the oil would likely need to sell somewhere between
\$63 and \$84 per barrel, based on an analysis from the World Wildlife
Fund --- higher than what energy analysts expect in a world reducing its
reliance on oil.

"They're betting that we're not going to be able to stick within the
confines of the Paris agreement," Wight said. "Arctic oil is a
fundamental bet on the future and what will and will not happen with the
energy transition."

## Arctic Research Advantage

### Research Adv\-\--Icebreakers Key\-\--2AC

#### Icebreakers are necessary. They are the [only way]{.underline} to reach [remote areas]{.underline}. 

**VMR 25**. Verified Market Research. \"Polar Icebreaker Market Size,

https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/polar-icebreaker-market/

The Polar Icebreaker Market can be segmented by end-users into five
primary categories: Government Agencies, Research Institutions, Shipping
Companies, Energy and Resource Companies, and Tour Operators. Each of
these segments plays a pivotal role in the utilization and demand for
**[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which [serve as
**essential**]{.mark} [**vessels** for **navigation**]{.mark} [through
**icy waters**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Government Agencies include
national and regional bodies responsible for icebreaker operations for
strategic maritime purposes, search and rescue missions, and enforcement
of sovereign rights over territorial waters in polar regions. [These
**agencies** often invest in **[advanced icebreakers]{.mark}** to
enhance national security [and **support scientific
missions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Research Institutions **utilize
icebreakers** for **scientific research** in **polar**]{.mark}
**[environments]{.mark}**, [facilitating **oceanographic studies**,
**climate** change **research**, and **ecological
surveys**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[These]{.mark} institutions [depend on icebreakers to **transport
researchers** and **equipment**]{.mark} [to **remote
locations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [where **access** is **otherwise
challenging**]{.underline}. Shipping Companies have a growing interest
in icebreakers for facilitating shipping routes that are becoming more
navigable due to climate change, particularly in the Arctic. These
companies seek to shorten transit times and enhance safety in icy
waters. Energy and Resource Companies leverage icebreakers to access and
transport resources like oil and gas in Arctic regions, where the
reliable deployment of icebreakers is crucial for the development of
offshore resources. Tour Operators increasingly use icebreakers for
eco-tourism endeavors, providing unique travel experiences in polar
regions, which adds a recreational angle to the market. By addressing
the needs of these diverse end-users, the Polar Icebreaker Market
reflects a multifaceted demand that is essential for navigation,
research, and resource extraction in harsh environments.

While often considered remote, [[the Arctic]{.mark} [**plays** a **large
role** in the **functioning** of many]{.mark} **[global environmental
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Post et al. 2019; Timmermans and
Marshall 2020). **[[In particular]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the Arctic is
involved with the [**regulation** of **global
climate**]{.mark}]{.underline} (McGuire et al. 2006) [with [important
**implications**]{.mark} [for the]{.mark} **[ongoing]{.mark} climate
[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Díaz et al. 2019[). While the Arctic may
hold less **biodiversity** than other **biomes**, [this biome\'s
**biodiversity** is **unique**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in that [it
includes]{.mark}]{.underline} more than 21 000 known
[[species]{.underline}]{.mark} of fungi, plants, and animals [that are
[highly]{.mark} [adapted to]{.mark} life in [the cold]{.mark} and in
some cases **could not survive without it**]{.underline} (see Fig. 1;
Callaghan et al. 2004; Payer et al. 2013; Ruth et al. 2023). These
adaptations come in many forms. For example, Arctic plants and
microorganisms have traits that make them tolerant to freezing, and
Arctic animals have developed various mechanisms such as fat storage
that allow them to tolerate frigid temperatures (Callaghan et al. 2004;
Guerrero and Rogers 2019). On a global scale, the Arctic is home to 27%
of the world\'s marine mammal species (Payer et al. 2013) and more than
20% of the world\'s lichenicolous fungi species (i.e., fungi that live
on lichens; Dahlberg and Bültmann 2013; Payer et al. 2013). The Arctic
also provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds that migrate to
the Arctic from around the globe to breed and forage (Sullender 2019).
There is even diversity within Arctic sea ice where numerous bacteria,
viruses, algae, and sea ice infauna (e.g., ciliates, nematodes,
turbellarians, crustaceans) reside (Bluhm et al. 2011; Patrohay et al.
2022).

Forum, "4 reasons why the Arctic is key to our planet's survival,"
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/4-reasons-why-the-arctic-is-key-to-our-planets-survival/

There are four reasons why [[the **Arctic**]{.mark} **Ocean**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} distinct from other oceans and [[critical
to]{.mark} our planet's **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

[First]{.underline}, while this relatively small (by ocean standards)
marine environment holds only 1% of the world's ocean volume and
occupies only 3% of the world's ocean surface area, [[its impact
on]{.mark} the global **climate [system]{.mark}** [is disproportionately
**large**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Second]{.underline}, though small in area, [[it scoops up]{.mark} over
10% of **global river [runoff]{.mark}** and claims twenty of the world's
100 longest rivers]{.underline}.

Third, the Arctic marine domain comprises about a third of the world's
coastline.

And fourth, [the Arctic Ocean contains one-quarter of the world's
**continental shelf**]{.underline}, [of immense socio-ecological
importance]{.underline}.

On all counts, the little Arctic Ocean holds its own on the global
stage.

Despite its importance, the Arctic Ocean sometimes goes missing from
public ocean-talk as more 'local' marine issues take centre stage. A key
point for non-experts is to recognize that [[the Arctic]{.mark}
Ocean]{.underline} is different from other oceans and it [[is
the]{.mark} **critical [driver]{.mark}** [of the global]{.mark}
**oceanic [conveyor belt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [the
**[Gulf]{.mark}** Stream [and]{.mark} **North [Atlantic]{.mark}**
[Current are]{.mark}]{.underline} strongly [[regulated]{.mark} by
processes that occur [in the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic
Ocean is remote to many of us, but [its influence can be felt
everywhere]{.underline}.

How do we know this? [Oceanographers have **robust scientific
evidence**]{.underline} on the role the Arctic plays within our planet.
For instance, [[the]{.mark} global [**hydrological cycle**
determines]{.mark} the distribution of [water around the
planet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[and affects]{.mark} **food** and
**water [security]{.mark}** [globally]{.mark}]{.underline}. This cycle
begins in warmer climates, with the equatorial trade winds and
mid-latitude westerlies. It is refined and shaped by the global
distribution of land masses that, in the northern hemisphere, collect
precipitation and direct it poleward through massive rivers. These
rivers introduce substantial amounts of fresh water into the upper
layers of the Arctic Ocean, providing the required conditions for an ice
cover to form, and regulating nutrient supplies and biological
productivity.

But these dynamics are undergoing unprecedented and worrying changes
that are already visible. Jonathan Smith, producer of Blue Planet II,
reflected on the new realities of filming in the Arctic Ocean: "We were
all set and ready to film but we needed two major things -- walrus and
ice. I had expected that walrus may be hard to find, but I did not
expect it to be hard to find ice in the Arctic.... the crew were all
commenting how surprisingly warm it was." They were not mistaken. Over
many years, scientists have been recording changes in global
temperature, hydrological cycles and sea-ice cover. These changes have
all had significant and eminently observable effects on the Arctic
Ocean. Over the past two decades alone, summer sea-ice coverage in the
Arctic Ocean has decreased by about seven million square kilometres to
just over 3 million square kilometres. This loss represents a surface
area larger than all but about a dozen countries in the world.

However, the Arctic Ocean is not just a passive victim of anthropogenic
change: [[it also **drives disruptions**]{.mark} back to the **global
system** in ways that were overlooked even a decade ago]{.underline}.
Though the exact mechanisms are still debated, Arctic sea-ice loss may
be affecting both ocean currents and mid-latitude weather patterns along
our southern borders. And the processes occurring in the Arctic play a
vital role in connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic. The fabled
Northwest Passage is more than a destination for explorers and
commercial ship traffic; [[the Arctic is a]{.mark}n oceanographic
[**freight train** that]{.mark} ties together and [influences]{.mark}
other **maritime regions** and [the **global climate
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Research Adv\-\--AT: No Arctic Disease\-\--2AC

#### "Black swan" pathogens risk catastrophic extinction.

Carissa **Wong 23**. \"\'Black swan\' pathogens from ancient permafrost
may be getting ready to wake up.\" Live Science. 8-2-2023.
https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/arctic/black-swan-pathogens-from-ancient-permafrost-may-be-getting-ready-to-wake-up

[**[Ancient pathogens]{.mark}** that have been locked away for hundreds
of thousands of years are starting to [**emerge** from permafrost as
climate change takes hold]{.mark} --- and **around [1%]{.mark}** of
these could [pose a **substantial risk** to **modern ecosystems**, a
**study has found**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"It is the first attempt to try modeling the potential ecological
effect of these kinds of time-traveling invaders from a quantitative
perspective,\" Giovanni Strona, a professor of ecological data sciences
at the University of Helsinki and co-author of the study, told Live
Science.

Permafrost is a mixture of soil, gravel and sand bound together by ice.
It is found either on or beneath Earth's surface in regions of the
Arctic, including parts of Alaska, Greenland, Russia, China and Northern
and Eastern Europe. When permafrost forms, microbes like bacteria and
viruses can get trapped inside it and can survive in a state of
suspended animation for thousands or even millions of years. Warmer
periods can kickstart metabolic processes that allow these dormant
microbes to reactivate and reproduce.

[Amid global warming, some of these microbes, including those with the
potential to cause disease, are being **released** as the **permafrost
thaws**]{.underline}. In 2016, an anthrax outbreak in Siberia killed
thousands of reindeer and affected dozens of people, which scientists
attributed to melting permafrost.

Related: Nematode resurrected from Siberian permafrost lay dormant for
46,000 years

These pathogens pose a potential risk because humans and other living
organisms alive today have not been exposed to them for so long ---
meaning modern ecosystems may have few defenses against them.

\"If pathogens have been living alongside bacterial, human or animal
communities for a long time, you can expect some co-evolution between
the pathogens and the local community, which reduces the risk that
pathogens pose to ecosystems,\" said Strona. \"But when you have a
time-traveling invader, you clearly have the introduction of novel
elements of risk.\"

To estimate how re-emerging pathogens might impact modern ecosystems,
Strona and his team digitally simulated the evolution of virus-like
pathogens that were able to infect and cause disease in bacteria-like
hosts.

In the simulation, digital microbes had to compete for resources,
mimicking what happens in the real world. Some of the viruses infected
and killed a fraction of the bacteria-like hosts, while other bacterial
hosts developed immunity against the evolving pathogens.

By \"infecting\" 5% of the modern bacteria-like hosts --- that had
evolved in more recent generations --- with ancient virus-like pathogens
from much earlier generations, the team found that 1% of viral pathogens
could substantially disrupt more recently evolved bacterial communities.

[Some of the viral invaders caused 32% of the bacteria-like species to
die out, while others caused the diversity of bacteria-like species to
increase by up to 12%.]{.underline}

[The team **dubbed [the 1% pathogens]{.mark}** [\"**black
swans**]{.mark}\"]{.underline} --- [[referring to a rare and]{.mark}
[unlikely, but **hugely impactful event**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They
argued that, [while the probability of them emerging and wreaking havoc
is low, [their **impact** would **be catastrophic**]{.mark}, [so they
should be **considered** in **future climate
scenarios**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[[As a society]{.mark}, [we need to]{.mark} understand the potential
risk posed by these ancient microbes so we can [prepare for any
**unintended consequences**]{.mark} of their release into the **modern
world**]{.underline},\" co-author Corey Bradshaw, from Australia\'s
Flinders University, said in a statement. \"[[The results tell us that
the risk is no longer **simply** a **fantasy** that we **shouldn't be
prepared to defend against**."]{.underline}]{.mark}

operations]{.mark} north of the]{.underline} [Arctic Circle, [but a U.S.
Navy **nuclear icebreaker**]{.mark} [would allow a **true forward

#### Positioning [missile defense]{.underline} in the Arctic is key to [broader effectiveness.]{.underline}

Arctic Region.\" Defense.info. 12-15-2023.
https://defense.info/re-thinking-strategy/2023/12/a-look-at-defense-competition-in-the-arctic-region/

For the United States, [[the Arctic remains **strategically relevant**
for **homeland missile defense**]{.mark} **capabilities**. It hosts a
greater part of the U.S. **missile defense** architecture **meant** for
**homeland defense**.]{.underline} **[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the region that makes the United States an Arctic country, [[is]{.mark}
referred to as "[the **most strategic place on
earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[19\] In 2021, the United States
completed construction of Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) that
would help track and defend against long range ICBMs and hypersonic
weapons \[20\] [**[forming the backbone]{.mark}** of US layered
**[missile defense]{.mark}** to **protect** its
homeland]{.underline}.\[21\]

In addition, the United States is also working on Next Generation
Interceptors (NGI) to replace the existing Ground Based Interceptors
(GBIs) which had myriad limitations. The interceptor would need to
counter enemy missiles as well as counter measures fitted on missiles as
well as counter high speed missile systems.

Hence, LRDR could complement the NGIs. There are also recommendations to
retain the GBIs also in Alaska owing to the North Korean missile threats
as the GBIs are undergoing Life Extension Program (LEP). \[22\] [In the
**near future**, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} also
[**consider** **deploying** the **Aegis Ashore system**]{.mark} with
**advanced interceptors** [in the **Arctic**]{.mark} along
with]{.underline} existing GBIs [till the NGIs becomes a success

COUNTERING COERCIVE ATTACKS FROM CHINA AND RUSSIA

Even as the United States adapts to the dynamic
**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean ICBM
threat, [[**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} are [building]{.mark} the
**missile**-based **[forces]{.mark}** necessary [to **threaten**]{.mark}
**the [US]{.mark}** [homeland]{.mark} at or **below** the **nuc**lear
**threshold** [to **enable**]{.mark} their strategies of
**[coercion]{.mark}** and theories of military
**[victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the United States has eschewed
developing homeland missile defenses of any kind designed to defeat
Chinese or Russian missile threats (except for a limited cruise missile
defense of the national capital region), [China]{.underline} and Russia
appear to [view this **perceived vulnerability** as an opportunity to
successfully deter, **coerce**, or ultimately **defeat US** efforts to
project **power** overseas]{.underline}.

According to some US experts, "Moscow and Beijing appear now to
calculate that their respective threats to escalate to limited nuclear
war will be sufficient to paralyze direct US opposition to their
regional expansionism."16 This may include dual-use capabilities to
attack the foundation of the US national defense strategy: power
projection from the homeland. The "2022 Nuclear Posture Review"
recognizes this problem, stating that the United States must prepare to
deter large-scale and limited nuclear use from its nuclear-armed
adversaries, especially in light of the increasing reliance on the
coercive threat of limited nuclear use in these states' strategies.17
More recently, Lt. Gen. Gregory Guillot, nominated to be the new
commander of US Northern Command, told Congress in July that the Defense
Department should consider expanding current national missile defense
policy to also counter coercive attacks on the United States by China or
Russia.18 There appears to be growing support for this approach, as the
bipartisan US Strategic Posture Commission reached consensus recently
and recommended that the "United States should develop and field
homeland \[integrated air and missile defense\] capabilities that can
deter and defeat coercive attacks by Russia and China."19

[[Deterring]{.mark} **coercive [nuc]{.mark}**lear strikes [or
**conventional strikes**]{.mark} with strategic effects against the
homeland **[requires]{.mark}**]{.underline} a combination of appropriate
conventional forces, nuclear forces, and [**[m]{.mark}**issile
**[d]{.mark}**efenses]{.underline}. The missile defense review (MDR) of
2022 notes that [**[regional]{.mark}** missile **[defenses]{.mark}** can
[help]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [deter]{.mark}
or defend against **[limited nuc]{.mark}**lear [**use** by]{.mark}
effectively [making]{.mark} the **risks** and potential [**costs**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} smaller-scale nuclear [[coercion]{.mark} appear
**[unacceptable]{.mark}**]{.underline}; there is no reason this concept
cannot also extend to the defense of the homeland.20 While China or
Russia could, in theory, simply overwhelm a US homeland missile defense
system designed to defend against coercive attacks, [the [**larger** the
**attack**]{.mark} size [needed]{.mark}]{.underline} to overcome US
defenses, [the [**more China** or **Russia** run]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} that the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
**[perceives]{.mark}** the motivations behind the [**attack** as
**unlimited** and **responds**]{.mark} **accordingly**]{.underline}.
Additionally, the larger the attack size needed to overcome US homeland
missile defenses, the better the chance the United States could detect
attack preparations and take the appropriate measures to improve its
defense posture.

[[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} the sheer variety of [[Chinese and
Russia]{.mark} missile **delivery systems**]{.underline}
([**[cruise]{.mark}**, ballistic, **[hypersonic]{.mark}** glide
vehicles, fractional [**orbital** systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
other potential combinations), [the question]{.underline} naturally [is:
**[what]{.mark}** kind of [US]{.mark} homeland **missile
[defenses]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} most [**needed** to deter]{.mark} and
defeat [coercive threats**?**]{.mark}]{.underline} If one of the US
objectives is to be able to intercept a handful of Chinese or Russian
ballistic missiles, then the [[current]{.mark} **homeland
[defense]{.mark}**]{.underline} architecture [could **potentially** be
**[sufficient if]{.mark}** it is **[upgraded]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
address their more sophisticated reentry vehicles armed with decoys and
countermeasures. To address these countermeasures, the Department of
Defense must improve the tracking and discriminating of warheads, likely
from space. If the GBI/NGI can sense Russian and Chinese reentry
vehicles and distinguish them from decoys, with the help of space-based
sensors, then it may have a reasonably good chance to complete the
intercept, even against these more sophisticated targets.

### Add-On\-\--Oil Spills\-\--2AC

#### Icebreakers are needed to respond to oil spills.

[**[Oil spills on ice]{.mark}**: [Preparing for]{.mark} the risks of
**[year-round Arctic oil production]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"We are minded to drill this year in the Chukchi," Shell CEO Ben van
Beurden told reporters on a January 29, 2015 earnings call. He
reinforced his point with a commitment to spend \$1 billion on the
effort this year, on top of the \$6 billion Shell has already spent on
its current Arctic campaign. This resoluteness comes despite a
disastrous 2012 exploratory drilling campaign that called into question
the company's competence to operate safely in Arctic conditions. That
year, Shell's legally required oil spill containment unit was "crushed
like a beer can" during tests in the calm waters of the Puget Sound; its
drilling contractor committed eight felony violations of maritime safety
and water pollution laws, resulting in \$12.2 million in federal fines;
and, at the season's end, Shell's 250-foot-tall, customized drill rig
Kulluk ended up aground after its contractor attempted to tow it through
gale force winds and 25-foot swell in a mad dash across December seas in
order to avoid tax liability to the state of Alaska. Coast Guard
officers led the coordinated response to the multi-day emergency, and
its Alaska-based aviators saved the Kulluk's 18 crewmembers in a
harrowing rescue operation, effectively preventing the crisis from
becoming a tragedy.

Hopefully, Shell will be better prepared and more judicious in its next
Arctic foray than it was in 2012. But the **[[human]{.mark}
[error]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[system **failures**]{.mark}, [and
life-threatening emergencies]{.mark} that stymied the **oil
company**]{.underline}---one of the world's richest and most
experienced---[[demonstrate]{.mark} the critical [necessity of]{.mark}
**[sustained Coast Guard presence]{.mark}** in a region with truly
humbling working]{.underline} [conditions]{.underline}. [Once the
company has located]{.underline} ideal [well sites]{.underline}, it will
reportedly take 7 to 10 years to build permanent offshore platforms and
other infrastructure needed to produce oil year round, at which point
both Shell and [[the Coast]{.mark} [Guard must be]{.mark}
[prepared]{.mark} to conduct]{.underline} [emergency and **oil spill
response** [year round,]{.mark} including in the **ice-bound Arctic
winter**.]{.underline}

Yet **[Polar Star]{.underline}**, already on an unplanned service-life

"The position of the United States upon the two oceans would be either a
source of great weakness or a cause of enormous expense." When Alfred
Thayer Mahan penned these words, Alaska was not yet a state and the
Arctic was still a vast icescape. But now Mahan's predictions must
undergo a twenty-first-century update to account for the arrival of the
third frontier: a blue Arctic. [As ice melts, **[new trade routes will
emerge]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[resources]{.mark} **long hidden
beneath** the **ice** will [become **accessible**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and a new strategic **battleground** will **emerge** at the **top of
the world**]{.underline}. While politicians and pundits debate the
validity of climate change and its causes, [the Arctic **continues** to
**melt**,]{.underline} [with blue waterways capable of supporting

[predicted by 2050.]{.underline} [Although continued focus on the
Indo-Pacific, Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Red Sea regions holds merit,
**accepting risk in the** Arctic may **result in failure** to prepare
for and adapt to the significant diplomatic, economic, cultural, and
military transformations already in the making.]{.underline}

[As [the **Arctic's melting ice** opens **new shipping
routes**]{.mark},]{.underline} [thaws previously ice-protected shores,
and unlocks access to untapped resources, [the far north takes
on]{.mark} **[new strategic importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[[the **Bering Strait**]{.underline}]{.mark}---expected to become the
Arctic's Gibraltar---[is [already a **chokepoint**]{.mark} [for **global
shipping**]{.mark}]{.underline} and military [operations]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [[Russia's]{.mark} [militarization]{.mark} of **[Arctic
territories]{.mark}** [and China's growing Arctic ambitions demand
our]{.mark} **[urgent attention]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [In

promote **global stability**, the United States must]{.underline} ignore
the red herring of climate debates and [instead accept the reality of
ice melt by [honing a **comprehensive**]{.mark} and **aggressive**
**[Arctic strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We have not a moment to
waste: already lagging years behind our competitors in this arena, such
a combined effort among US military, federal, and private entities will
require decades of planning.

Climate Change and Warfare: An Environmental History

While Earth's climate is changing at a faster pace than ever before,
climatic episodes over the past two thousand years---like the Roman
Climate Optimum (200 BCE--150 CE), the Little Antique Ice Age (300
CE--700 CE), the Medieval warming period (950 CE--1250), and the Little
Ice Age (1350--1850)---offer important perspective. In this era of
human-influenced climate change, these periods tell us that climate
change does not always spell disaster. Indeed, studies of these periods
tell us that climate influences the conduct or outcome of war rather
than determining it. Our modern era of climate change can certainly
exacerbate vulnerabilities for those militaries who ignore it; but for
those who most capture the winds of history into the sails of their
respective war machines, it can provide strategic opportunities.

Climate can influence who you fight, what you fight over, when you fight
and where, and perhaps most importantly, why you fight. Changing Arctic
conditions demand strategists consider those five W's in a
twenty-first-century context. Before 2050, the United States, Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland must assess how the diminishing
North Pole ice wall will transform into blue borders accessible not only
to trade, but also to other strategic competitors, like Russia and
China. **[The importance]{.underline}** [of such considerations could
hardly be overstated]{.underline}: [**Arctic flashpoints** include vast
**mineral resources**, largely untapped **oil and gas reserves**, and
disputes over **sovereignty** within **exclusive economic zones** and
resultant **trade wars**]{.underline}. In the past, such considerations
have only been necessary in the summer months (except for submarine and
long-range air assets), when climate conditions were most hospitable to
both land and sea forces. [Yet [melting ice is]{.mark} [projected
to]{.mark} [allow for year-round]{.mark} naval and [**commercial
shipping competition** as early as **2050**]{.mark}]{.underline}---with
sea trade via the region expected to double by 2035. [[Compared]{.mark}
[to the]{.mark} [Panama and Suez Canals, the Northern Sea Route]{.mark}
[offers]{.mark} significantly **[reduced]{.mark} [transit
times]{.mark}**---and with it, **fuel costs**---thus rendering it
perhaps the most **[lucrative]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark}** [to
traditional **shipping lanes**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But why reallocate resources from our present strategic footprint?
Simply put, the Arctic is quickly evolving into the new dance floor for
geopolitical competition (including, in its most extreme manifestation,
warfare), replete with all the classic Thucydidean trappings of fear,
honor, and interest. This is not an exaggeration: Russia and China have
already signaled their desire for Arctic dominance. With the world's
largest icebreaker fleet, Russia poses the most dominant and formidable
force in the region. Russia has seized the strategic and operational
advantage, maintaining near-continuous operations in the Arctic,
sharpening firsthand experience in the seascape, and challenging any
foreign militaries who dare transit these frigid waters. Not far behind
Russia, China---the self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---has similarly
declared itself a regional force. China has invested heavily in its
Polar Silk Road, thus expanding its maritime and global spheres of
influence and all but guaranteeing strategic and economic returns in the
region.

US Arctic Strategy

In recent years, DoD's Arctic Strategy has undergone considerable review
and revision. Indeed, current policy is drastically different from the
policies of a decade ago. These new strategic visions no doubt have
heightened our awareness of the Arctic's growing geopolitical
importance, and these policies are not without their strengths. But our
most recent strides leave one wondering: Are we doing enough? The United
States is an Arctic nation, but does our strategic policy fully reflect
this? Current US strategy acknowledges, for example, the Arctic is not
just warming---it's becoming a new arena for strategic competition. In
this light, the strategy's "monitor-and-respond" approach reads as both
too passive and too reactive for the competitive contest likely to
develop in the far north. While we recognize the innate importance of
robust monitoring and other intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities in the region, we also acknowledge that
China and Russia are already conducting combined exercises off the coast
of Alaska. Considered in this light, our monitor-and-respond strategy
resembles the military equivalent of relying on a giant Ring camera:
it's great for observation, but insufficient for deterring adversaries
and projecting power.

More alarming still, the United States lags woefully behind her fellow
great powers in Arctic preparations. By the time the United States
published its first radical transformation of Arctic strategic policy,
it was decades, even centuries, behind Russia's interest in the
region---an interest that transformed into action by the 2000s.
Likewise, China has been honing its Arctic intentions since 2013, when
it gained "observer" status in the Arctic Council. The following year,
Russia created its Arctic Joint Strategic Command, and just three years
after that, declared its plans to "phase NATO out of the Arctic." By
2018, China published its first Arctic policy white paper, and shortly
after launched its first domestically built icebreaker. In 2023, Russia
declared the Arctic its second priority---a priority Moscow is well
positioned to promote with its already robust Arctic presence and
operating bases. Two of the world's most powerful militaries have
signaled their intent to establish strategic, diplomatic, and economic
dominance of the world's smallest ocean. Can the United States really
afford to simply monitor and respond?

We recognize this call to action is not without significant obstacles.
As our most current Arctic Strategy rightly points out, we must "balance
against other DoD global commitments"---and we have to determine how to
do this in an environment replete with fiscal, structural,
environmental, and manpower challenges. We are not suggesting that DoD
abandon our global commitments in favor of Arctic operations. We are
arguing, however, that the department cannot abandon Arctic power
projection in favor of keeping global commitments. It will be hard. It
will stretch our forces and our capabilities. But it is worth
remembering that Russia is doing both. China is doing both. And
increasingly, they are doing both together---including in back-to-back
naval exercises in 2022 and 2023 off the coast of Alaska. Accordingly,
we must do both, and we must start now. US Arctic strategy and policy
must shift from a future-oriented mindset of what we will do when time
and resources allow to an ethos of what we are doing now, lest we look
back in 2030 or 2050 at what we should've, could've, or would've done
differently to prepare for a blue Arctic. In this light, aiming
principally to "manage risk in the region" is not an acceptable
substitute for establishing presence. The United States must take action
now to ensure we are prepared to successfully maintain peace and
prosperity in the blue Arctic.

Policy Recommendations

We do not diminish the immense difficulties the United States faces in
implementing such active---but vital---strategic and operational
postures. Establishing a presence in the Arctic and also maintaining
presence and capability in other global regions with US interests at
stake will stretch our manpower and our assets. But [we argue our stated
objectives can be achieved in the following ways:]{.underline}

1\. Increase year-round air, land, surface, and subsurface operations in
the Arctic now. We can ill afford, as the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy puts
it, to "explore options to improve mobility in all seasons and variable
conditions across the Arctic's diverse geography and weather" when our
adversaries are already past the exploratory and into the operational
phase. The Arctic is a highly dynamic operational environment that
forces even the most seasoned DoD operators to perform familiar tasks in
new ways. We must practice these tasks in adverse conditions now.

2\. Assess manpower and other resource alignment against the full range
of US global interests and ensure the Arctic is appropriately resourced.
Based on the findings, DoD should be prepared to consider an increase in
the size of the US military while simultaneously ramping up sustained
year-round Arctic operations.

3\. [Build or obtain more polar-capable icebreakers now. Russia's
icebreaker fleet far exceeds ours]{.underline}. [Indeed, even our
"**near-Arctic**" peer competitor, China, has more. [**Expanding the
icebreaker fleet** will ensure **year-round access** **to** and presence
in **Arctic waters**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### That solves [all global war]{.underline}.

Misunderstanding Economic Interdependence.\" Cato Institute.

This essay stands athwart this paranoia about malevolent forms of
interdependence and yells, "stop!" Economic interdependence is hardly a
cure-all for U.S. national security concerns, but it also is not the
acute national security threat that is commonly articulated inside the
Beltway. [[Concerns]{.mark} have [been **greatly exaggerated**]{.mark},
while [the]{.mark} **geopolitical [benefits]{.mark}** of
**interdependence** have [been **underestimated**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Even in 2023, China's interdependence with the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development economies has acted as a constraint on its
foreign policy behavior. Indeed, the Biden administration seems
belatedly aware that it has stigmatized trade with China a bit too much.
If current trends persist, however, the United States risks further
geoeconomic fragmentation---and the loosening of those constraints. The
worldview of malevolent interdependence is likely wrong, but those fears
can be self-fulfilling. In other words, if policymakers continue to view
globalization as a threat, then the combined policy responses are likely
to increase the likelihood of great power conflict.

How Could Economic Interdependence Affect World Politics?

The liberal paradigm in international relations (not to be confused with
how the word "liberal" is used in the left-right distinctions of
American politics) rests on a "Kantian triad" of interlocking forces
designed to prevent the anarchic nature of world politics from spilling
over into violent conflict. It was believed that a world of democratic
states, international organizations, and [economic
**[interdependence]{.mark}** would [lead to]{.mark} a pluralistic
**security community** in which **[no state]{.mark}** would
[have]{.mark} the [**incentive** to **start a
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within Kant's own writings, it is true that
the economic interdependence plank was the weakest of the three. Modern
scholars, however, have argued that [the logic of [**commercial peace**
is]{.mark} as strong or [**stronger** than]{.mark} that of
**[democratic]{.mark} peace**]{.underline}.

[Commercial peace [between **nations**]{.mark} operates through multiple
**causal mechanisms**]{.underline}. The simplest one is at the
individual level: [in trading states, **ambitious [individuals]{.mark}**
will [flock to the **commercial**]{.mark} **sector** [rather
than]{.mark} the **[security sector]{.mark}**, thereby
**taming**]{.underline} ~~man's~~ [passions and [converting them
into]{.mark} **economic [self-interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [At the
domestic **political level**, the [growth of trade]{.mark} between
countries also [creates]{.mark} **interest [groups]{.mark}** on both
sides [with]{.mark} a **vested [interest]{.mark}** [in maintaining
**harmonious**]{.mark} **bilateral [relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At
the level of [the **international system**, commercial peace
**operates** by a [simple **rational choice**]{.mark}: state
[leaders]{.mark} will be [wary of]{.mark} the **[loss of
wealth]{.mark}** that would [come with a **war**]{.mark} against a
**trading partner**]{.underline}. These logics are not mutually
exclusive but rather reinforcing---and all of them contribute to the
power of commercial peace.

Some liberal scholars have gone even further. Keohane and Nye argued
that [[complex **interdependence**]{.mark} would drastically
**[reduce]{.mark} the utility** of [force]{.mark} in world
politics]{.underline}. Erik Gartzke argued that [[capitalist
peace]{.mark} is **so powerful** that it is the [**primary driver**
behind **democratic peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gartzke suggested that
[the spread of **market forces** reduces violence for multiple reasons,
including that "the historic impetus to **territorial
[expansion]{.mark}** is [tempered by]{.mark} the **rising
[importance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} intellectual and **financial
[capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}" and that "the rise of global capital
markets [creates a **new mechanism** for competition]{.underline} and
communication for states that might otherwise be forced to fight." He is
hardly the only scholar to advance this argument. More popular
proponents, like Thomas L. Friedman, argued that globalization was so
powerful that it flattened many power differentials that existed in the
world.
