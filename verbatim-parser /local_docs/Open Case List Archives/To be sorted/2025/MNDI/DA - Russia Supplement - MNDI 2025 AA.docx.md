### UQ\-\--War Chest Low\-\--2NC

#### Putin's war chest is drained and can't sustain a war

[[Russia's economy is facing a "moment of truth" as high
inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}, an ailing private
sector, [[and]{.underline} [critical shortages]{.underline} ]{.mark} are
poised
to [[constrain]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir [[Putin's war]{.underline}]{.mark} on
Ukraine, according to economist and author Anders Åslund.Nearly three
years after launching its invasion, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[headed]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[stagflation]{.underline}]{.mark},
meaning [[high]{.mark} [inflation]{.mark}]{.underline} combined
with [[minimal growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, he wrote at Project
Syndicate on Jan. 14.While official statistics show inflation quickened
to an annual pace of 9.5% in December from 8.9% in November, other
measures suggest it's far higher. For example,
independent [[research]{.underline}]{.mark} firm Romir [[has]{.mark}
[calculated]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[prices]{.underline}]{.mark} for
a basket of certain consumer goods [[jumped by 22% in
September]{.underline}.]{.mark}

"[[Strained]{.underline}]{.mark} by these
factors, the [[Russian]{.mark} [economy is approaching its moment
of]{.mark} [truth]{.mark}]{.underline}," Åslund wrote. "[[Inflation will
continue to rise]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2025, and people will get even
angrier over higher food prices. Major [[bankruptcies are
looming]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}
state [[cannot afford]{.underline}]{.mark} large bailouts. Business
leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage
of labor---and soldiers---is reaching a crisis stage."The worst
shortage, however, is budget cash as liquid reserves are on pace to run
out this fall, he predicted.

By then, [[budget cuts will be necessary,]{.underline}]{.mark} while the
Kremlin may have to resort to the "Soviet sins" of price controls and
rationing."As the risk of a financial crash
rises, [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} imperiled [[economy is about to
pose]{.underline}]{.mark} serious [[constraints
on]{.underline}]{.mark} Putin's [[war]{.underline}]{.mark}," he
addedÅslund and other Russia watchers have previously said that [[the
economy will be]{.mark} [unable to sustain the
war]{.mark}]{.underline} on Ukraine for much longer.

For
instance, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[can't manufacture]{.underline}]{.mark} certain [[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} at
a high enough rate [[to]{.mark} [replace battlefield
losses]{.mark}]{.underline} and is dipping into Cold War--era
inventories. That means [[Russia]{.mark} [may not be able to wage
war]{.mark}]{.underline} beyond late 2025, when [[it will begin running
out of key]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Russia is [drowning --]{.underline} sustained sanctions will lead to peace talks

"Russia's Battlefield Woes in Ukraine", CSIS,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine>)

First, [[Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters
per]{.mark}]{.underline} day in such areas as Kharkiv, slower than
during the Somme offensive in World War I, where French and British
forces advanced an average of 80 meters per day. [[Russian rates of
advance have]{.mark} also been [significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}
[s[low]{.underline}]{.mark}[er]{.underline} than during such offensives
as Galicia in 1914 (1,580 meters per day), Gorzia in 1916 (500 meters),
Belleau Wood in 1918 (410 meters), Leningrad in 1943 (1,000 meters), and
Kursk-Oboyan in 1943 (3,220 meters). Even Russia's rate of advance in
parts of Donetsk Oblast, averaging 135 meters per day, has been
remarkably slow.

Second, [[Russia's seizure of]{.underline}]{.mark} [approximately 5,000
square kilometers [of territory]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine since
January 2024 **[has been paltry]{.underline}**---[amounting to
[less]{.mark}]{.underline} [[than 1 percent of Ukrainian
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}---and has occurred mainly in Donetsk,
Luhansk, and Kharkiv Oblasts. [[Russia's marginal gains are
particularly]{.underline} [noteworthy compared to]{.underline}]{.mark}
its conquest of 120,000 square kilometers during [[the first five weeks
of the war]{.underline}]{.mark} and Ukraine's recapture of 50,000 square
kilometers in the spring of 2022.

Third, [[Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment across the
land, air, and sea domains]{.underline},]{.mark} highlighting the sharp
matériel toll of its attrition campaign. Since January 2024, for
example, Russia has lost roughly 1,149 armored fighting vehicles, 3,098
infantry fighting vehicles, 300 self-propelled artillery, and 1,865
tanks. Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been
significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of
5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine's favor.

Fourth, [Russian [fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary.
Russia will]{.underline} ]{.mark}likely [[hit the 1 million casualty
mar]{.mark}k]{.underline} in the summer of 2025---a stunning and grisly
milestone. Overall, a high of 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in
Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, [[a
sign]{.underline} **[of Putin's]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[blatant
[disregard for his soldiers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To put these numbers
into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as
many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet
wars combined between the end of World War II and the start of the
full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in
Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet
Union's decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia's
13 years of war in Chechnya.6

[[Increased sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russia and continuing U.S.
and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs
for Moscow of a protracted war and **[[could facilitate peace
talks]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Russia's poor performance]{.underline}]{.mark}** has likely **[[been
caused by]{.underline}]{.mark}** several factors: the [[Russian
military's reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized]{.underline}
[force]{.underline}]{.mark}[s]{.underline} to take Ukrainian territory,
Russia's [[failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that
enables maneuver]{.mark},]{.underline} and [[Ukraine's effective
utilization of defense in depth]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the United
States, [[increased sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russia and
continuing U.S. and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely
[[raise the costs]{.underline}]{.mark} for Moscow of a protracted war
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[facilitate peace
talks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### UQ\-\--Russia Wins Negotiations\-\--2NC

#### Ukraine won't back down on Russia's terms

**Popeski & Kozhukar 25**, \*Reuters Editor and Correspondent for
Eastern Europe, \*\*Legal Scholar at the Ukranian Catholic University
specializing in International Law and Human Rights (\*Ron and
\*\*Oleksandr, 6/28, "Top Ukranian Commander Sees New Assault on Key
Eastern City", Reuters,
https://www.reuters.com/world/top-ukrainian-commander-sees-new-assault-key-eastern-city-2025-06-28/

June 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine\'s top commander said on Saturday that his
forces faced a new onslaught against a key city on the eastern front of
its war against Russia, while Moscow said it was making progress in
another sector farther southwest.

After their initial failed advance on the capital Kyiv in the first
weeks after the February 2022 invasion, Russian troops have focused on
capturing all of Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. The city of
Kostiantynivka has been a major target.

[[Ukrainian forces have for months defended the city against fierce
assaul]{.underline}ts]{.mark}, with the regional governor urging
remaining residents this week to evacuate as infrastructure breaks down.

Top Ukrainian commander Oleksander Syrskyi, writing on Telegram on
Saturday, said the area around Kostiantynivka was gripped by heavy
fighting.

[[\"The enemy is surging]{.underline}]{.mark} towards Kostiantynivka,
[but [apart from sustaining numerous losses, has achieved
nothing,]{.mark}\"]{.underline} Syrskyi said.

\"The aggressor is trying to break through our defences and advance
along three operating sectors.\"

A spokesman for Ukrainian forces in the east, Viktor Trehubov, told the
Ukrinform news agency that Kostiantynivka and the city of Pokrovsk to
the west were \"the main arena of battles and the Kremlin\'s strategic
ambitions\".

Syrskyi also said that [[Ukrainian forces had withstood in the past week
a powerful attack]{.mark}]{.underline} near the village of Yablunivka in
northeastern Sumy region, where Russian forces have been trying to
establish a buffer zone inside the Ukrainian border.

[[Russia\'s Defence Ministry]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a report earlier
in the day[, [said]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Moscow\'s forces had seized
the village]{.underline}]{.mark} of Chervona Zirka \-- further
southwest, near the administrative border of Dnipropetrovsk region.

Russia\'s slow advance through eastern Ukraine, with Moscow claiming a
string of villages day after day, has resulted in destruction of major
cities and infrastructure.

[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} has **[[insisted]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[that [progress]{.mark} towards]{.underline} a [settlement]{.underline}
of the 40-month-old war [[depends on]{.underline}
[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} [[recognising Moscow\'s
control]{.underline}]{.mark} over four Ukrainian regions \-- Luhansk,
Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

[[Russian forces control about one-fifth of Ukraine\'s
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}, though they do not fully hold any of the
four regions.

Moscow has said in recent weeks that its troops have made advances in
areas adjacent to Dnipropetrovsk region, which lies next to both Donetsk
and Zaporizhzhia regions. Ukrainian officials have denied those reports.

#### Even with a stalemate, continued resources are necessary

Stalemate Means in Ukraine and Why it Matters", Institute For the Study

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} initial [[Russian]{.mark} [campaign]{.mark}
to invade]{.underline} and conquer [Ukraine [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[culminating without achieving its
objectives]{.underline}**]{.mark}---[it is being defeated,]{.underline}
in other words. **[[The war is settling into a
stalemate]{.underline}]{.mark}** condition in much of the theater.
But [[the war]{.mark} [isn't over]{.mark} and isn't likely to end
soon]{.underline}. Nor is the outcome of the war yet clear. [The
Russians might still win; the Ukrainians might win; the war might expand
to]{.underline} involve [other countries]{.underline}; or it might turn
into a larger scale version of the stalemate in Ukraine's east that had
persisted from 2014 to the start of Russia's invasion in February
2022. [[The failure of Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} initial
[[military campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} nevertheless [[marks]{.mark} an
[important inflection that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has]{.mark}
[implications]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark}]{.underline} and execution **[[of]{.mark} [Western
military, economic, and political

[to]{.mark} help [keep]{.mark} [Ukraine alive]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
country **[[even in conditions of stalemate.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

A campaign is a major military undertaking launched as part of a war
effort to achieve one or more objectives that are necessary but not
necessarily sufficient to achieving the overall war aims. [The
[Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a
month ago was such an undertaking---its [[aims]{.mark} of seizing Kyiv
and Ukraine's other major cities [were part
of a]{.mark}]{.underline} larger [[effort]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[replace]{.mark} the [government of
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, [destroy the Ukrainian
military, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[allow]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian
President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} [to set]{.mark} political, economic,
and security [conditions]{.mark} in Ukrainian territory]{.underline} to

### UQ\-\--Trump\-\--2NC

#### Trump is focused on ending Ukraine conflict now

Rubio says the [["protracted conflict]{.mark}" [must end in
"negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}," where "both sides are going to have
to give something up" via "the work [of]{.underline} hard diplomacy,
which is what we used to do in the world in the past."

[["But both sides in a negotiation have to give
something]{.mark}.]{.underline} And that\'s going to take time, but at
[[least we have a President that recognizes that our objective is this
conflict needs to end]{.mark},]{.underline} and it needs to end in a way
that\'s enduring, because it\'s an unsustainable -- on all sides, it\'s
ultimately unsustainable," he added.

[[The negotiated settlement is in the interest of Prime
Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy]{.mark},]{.underline} Rubio argues, in
light of the destruction wrought.

"Ukraine is being set back 100 years; their energy grid is being wiped
out. I mean, someone\'s going to have to pay for all this reconstruction
after the fact. And how many Ukrainians have left Ukraine, living in
other countries now? They may never return. I mean, that\'s their
future, and it\'s in danger in that regard."

Russia needs an exit, too.

"Both sides are paying a heavy price for this[[. Both sides have
incentive for this conflict to end]{.underline}]{.mark}.  It\'s not
going to end with the maximalist goals of either side, and there\'s
going to have to be a lot of hard work done. And I think [[only the
United States, under the leadership of President Trump, can make that
possible]{.underline}.]{.mark} But it won\'t be easy, and it\'ll take
some time."

If we don't take into account the dwindling figures of its economy,

but [[its inherent offensive]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}
**[cannot be denied]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In 2014, Russia opened a new
Unified Strategic Command, called "OSK Sever," to strengthen the
security of its vast Arctic borders and secure its Arctic
interests.15) The Kola Peninsula16) remains the crux of Russian military
establishment in the western Arctic, for securing its strategic
interests and for power projection capabilities in the Atlantic Ocean
and beyond. Russia claims to have built 475 new military sites,
including bases north of the Arctic Circle, as well as 16 new deep-water
ports. It secures this presence through sophisticated new air defense
systems and anti-ship missiles.

along with other major Western nations [imposed economic and financial

Security Forces Roundtable. [These events, among many others, help
explain the [increased]{.mark} [pace of military deployment]{.mark}
[along]{.mark} the [Russian]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}
[waters]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [geopolitical]{.underline}
[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} near the Black Sea [[had]{.mark} [direct

security]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[affirming]{.mark} the [notion of
strategic spillovers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Mathieu Boulègue best sums
this up in his article on Russian military posture:
"[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[unique
geography]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[the [Arctic]{.mark} [does not exist
in]{.mark} [isolation]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the [wider international
context]{.mark},]{.underline}** or a[way from the pressures [around the
strained relations]{.mark}]{.underline} between Russia and the West."

[The [probability]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a significant [military
clash]{.mark}]{.underline} between the United States and Russia **[[is
heightened]{.underline}]{.mark}** by the frequent encounters of
NATO-operated and Russian vessels in the Barents and Norwegian Seas. In
2018, the Russian military jammed18) the GPS telecommunication channels
during a major NATO exercise, "Trident Juncture," in Norway. Further,
the Russian bases in the Kola Peninsula and NATO bases in Norway are
separated by just a few kilometers. The possibility of a future clash is
further intensified by the fact that out of the seven Arctic States
aside from Russia, five are NATO allies (the United States, Canada,
Denmark, Iceland, and Norway) and the other two (Finland and Sweden) are
NATO enhanced opportunities partners. Thus, the [[century-old
tensions]{.mark} between Russia and the United States will
[continue]{.mark} [to threaten Arctic stability.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Western Nations have incentives to support Ukraine in the long run

**Puri 24,** Australian War College, Canberra, Australia, King's College
London, UK. (Samir, 09/19, "Every War Must End: And it is Time to End
Western Strategic Magical Thinking in Ukraine, Military Strategy
Magazine,
<https://www.militarystrategymagazine.com/exclusives/every-war-must-end-and-it-is-time-to-end-western-strategic-magical-thinking-in-ukraine/>)

In this context, one can point to one notable difference apparent in the
strategic outlooks of the Western powers, vis-à-vis Russia. For Russia,
whatever the operational setbacks it experiences and the failure to
realise initial goals, be it in Ukraine or elsewhere, its standard
approach has been to seek to gain something, even from a botched
invasion. Its modus operandi is to persist over the long term, but
crucially to modify its strategic objectives, rather than stick rigidly
to unachievable ones.\[xlvi\] In contrast, the West seems intent on
following its own familiar strategic playbook, witnessed most recently
in the humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021:
hold out for everything only to risk losing it all in the end.

The understandable notion that Russia could never be willingly rewarded
for its aggression now juxtaposes awkwardly with the reality that Russia
seems able to wrest some important gains for itself at Ukraine's
expense. [Deriding these gains as 'catastrophic' in terms of the costs
Russia has sustained has some merit in building a story around Ukrainian
defiance and success]{.underline}. But this would now form part of the
West's own off-ramp for explaining why outcomes in Ukraine will fall far
short of the declared desired maximal outcomes.

[A complete [abandonment of Ukraine by every single Western nation
is]{.mark} still largely [unthinkable and]{.mark} remains both
[strategically unwise]{.mark} and [morally
unsatisfactory]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Even]{.mark} if Donald
[Trump]{.mark} returns to the White Hous]{.underline}e and leaves the
job of supporting Ukraine's defence and reconstruction to the European
countries, [[support for Ukraine is unlikely to
cease.]{.underline}]{.mark} The sheer complexity that now awaits any
attempt to bring the fighting to a swift end with the establishment of a
demilitarised zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces (an idea floated
by Trump's running mate J. D. Vance during the US presidential campaign)
is itself likely to prove complex and protracted .\[xlvii\] And if
Kamala Harris wins the election, US support to Ukraine will have to
adapt to the evolving realities of a war that will soon enter its fourth
year by the time the next US president takes office.

The argument presented here is not to end the war at any cost and on any
terms. Neither is it to sell-out Ukraine to Russia by privileging the
Kremlin's objectives. Far from it[. But [**supporting Ukraine** to
remain independent and defensible in the long run]{.mark} despite
suffering a de-facto division [is a very different **strategic goal to
supporting Ukraine**]{.mark} to wage perpetual warfare to secure
diminishing tactical victories. The Western powers, whether largely
united or divided when doing so, will sooner or later need to work with
the Ukrainian leadership to switch strategy. They will have to do so in
ways that snap out of strategic magical thinking.]{.underline}

#### Peace talks hinge on US mediation

Talks Hinges on Efforts of Kyiv, Krelmin Says", Reuters,

June 30 (Reuters) - The [[pace of talks]{.underline} [to resolve the
war]{.underline}]{.mark} in Ukraine **[[depend]{.mark}s [on]{.mark}
[Kyiv\'s]{.mark} [position]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the
**[[effectiveness]{.mark} [of U.S. mediation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
the situation on the ground, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in
remarks televised on Sunday. 

Five months into U.S. President Donald Trump\'s term, **[[there is no
clear end]{.mark} to [the
war](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-russia-is-ready-hold-more-talks-with-ukraine-return-more-bodies-2025-06-27/)]{.underline}** Russia
launched in February 2022 against its smaller neighbour, despite his
2024 campaign vow to end it in one day. 

[[Trump]{.underline},]{.mark} who has pushed both sides towards
ceasefire talks since his January inauguration, said on Friday he
[[thinks]{.mark} \"[something will]{.mark}
[happen]{.mark}]{.underline}\" about a settlement of the war. 

\"A lot depends, naturally, on the position of the Kyiv regime,\" Peskov
told Belarus 1 TV, the main state television channel in Russia\'s
neighbour. 

\"[[It depends on]{.mark} how [effective]{.mark}ly
[Washington]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} **[[mediating efforts]{.mark}
continue]{.underline}**,\" he said, adding that the situation on the
ground was another factor that could not be ignored. 

Peskov did not elaborate on what Moscow expects from Washington or Kyiv.
Moscow has been demanding that Ukraine cede more land and abandon
Western military support, conditions Kyiv calls unacceptable. 

[[While no date]{.mark} [has been set]{.mark} for the next round of
talks]{.underline}, Peskov said [[Russia]{.mark} [hoped]{.mark}
dates]{.underline} would [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}come clear
\"**[[in]{.mark} the [near future]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** 

After a gap of more than three years, Russia and Ukraine held
face-to-face talks in Istanbul on May 16 and June 2 that led to a series
of prisoner exchanges and the return of their dead soldiers. 

**[[They have made no progress towards a
ceasefire]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however. Their blueprints for a peace
deal shared at the June 2 talks were \"absolutely contradictory
memorandums\", Russian President
Vladimir [Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia/vladimir-putin/) said
on Friday. 

Russia, which already controls about a fifth of Ukraine, continues to
advance gradually, gaining ground in recent weeks in Ukraine\'s
southeastern regions of Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk, and ramping up air
attacks nationwide. 

Turkey, which hosted the previous round of talks, is ready to host them
again, it said on Friday.

Vladimir Putin has undone much of what his predecessor, Mikhail
Gorbachev, had set out to achieve as part of the Murmansk Initiative of
1987. Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has served to further ostracize
a nation with significant interests in the Arctic, well beyond the
condemnation and sanctioning that it had experienced in the wake of its
2014 annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine[. [In response
to Russia's brutal war]{.mark} of choice that has trampled on
international norms of sovereignty and human rights, [Arctic states
imposed]{.mark} a swath of [political and economic
sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Given that context, business as usual
in Arctic governance and collaborative activities were not options, and
[the Arctic could **not be a "zone of exception"** in response to
violations of the international legal order]{.mark}]{.underline}.64 Evan
Bloom, a former US diplomat who helped to establish the Arctic Council
as a "safe space" for the conduct of Arctic issues, contends [that in
the wake of Russian activities cooperation in the normal mode is no
longer possible]{.underline}.65 Russian officials have bridled at their
isolation, terming it irrational to exclude their country, which has
60-percent of the Arctic coastline and half the region's population.66

[The [consequences for engagement in the Arctic will indeed be
profound]{.mark} as diplomatic, economic, environmental, and security
discourse remain fractured and the trajectory of future Arctic security
dialogue remains uncertain]{.underline}. The impending accession of
Finland and Sweden as NATO members will serve to consolidate all Arctic
Council nations apart from Russia under the NATO umbrella. Once it
becomes possible to resume the activities of the Arctic Council, it is
unclear if Russia would want a seat at a NATO-dominant table, even if
the organization lacks a mandate to discuss security issues. [Moreover,
Russia has been excluded from existing Arctic security dialogues since
2014, and]{.underline} [[the Arctic region now lacks a formal mechanism
to address security issues involving Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[finds itself]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
the [front lines]{.mark} [of a clash]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[democratic]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [authoritarian
worlds]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Since the collapse of the
USSR]{.underline}, the former [[captive nations]{.mark} of the Soviet
Union [have struggled to emerge]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} centuries of [Russian [imperial
rule]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have
succeeded in integrating into Western economic and security alliances.
Others such as Belarus have returned to the Kremlin
orbit. [[Ukraine's]{.mark} [journey]{.mark} has [been]{.mark} the [most
challenging]{.mark} of all.]{.underline}

Since 1991, [[Ukraine]{.mark} has]{.underline} slowly but
steadily [[moved]{.underline}]{.mark} away [[from the
totalitarian]{.underline}]{.mark} past and set out on a
pathway [[toward]{.mark} a [democratic European
future]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [these [efforts]{.mark} have [been
hampered by Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} [[determination to
reassert]{.mark} its [control]{.mark}]{.underline} over the country.
Since the early years of the post-Soviet era, it has become apparent
that [[Moscow views the emergence of]{.underline}]{.mark} a genuinely
independent and democratic [[Ukraine as]{.underline}
[an existential threat to]{.underline}]{.mark} [its own [authoritarian
model]{.mark}]{.underline} and a potential catalyst for the next chapter
in Russia's retreat from empire.

[[Ukraine's resilience in]{.underline}]{.mark} the face
of [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} initial [[invasion]{.mark} [in
2014]{.mark} and]{.underline} the full-scale attack
of [[2022]{.underline}]{.mark} [[demonstrates]{.mark} the
[success]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [country's]{.mark}
[nation-building]{.mark} [efforts]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[strength]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Ukrainian [civil
society.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Despite the immense pressures of
war, today's [[Ukraine]{.mark} [remains]{.mark} [committed to democratic
values]{.mark}]{.underline} and Euro-Atlantic integration. This helps to
explain why Putin regards continued Ukrainian independence as so
dangerous.

Moscow's ambitions are no secret. [The [Kremlin]{.mark} [views]{.mark}
its [war]{.mark} against Ukraine [as]{.mark} both [a crucial step toward
rebuilding the Russian Empire]{.mark}]{.underline} and as a tool in the
broader struggle to transform the geopolitical landscape. [[Putin is
determined to erase]{.mark} [Ukrainian
statehood]{.mark}]{.underline} while simultaneously eroding the very
foundations of international law and global security.

In [[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} worldview, today's rules-based order
is merely a construct that serves US interests rather than a framework
for mutually beneficial global cooperation. He is [now [building]{.mark}
a [coalition]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [like-minded]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark} who share his ambition
of [[establishing]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} [world order]{.mark}
[defined]{.mark} [by spheres of interest]{.mark} [and power
projection]{.mark},]{.underline} where the world's largest nations are
free to dominate their smaller neighbors.

[[Continued Western weakness]{.underline}]{.mark} in the wake of
Russia's 2022 [invasion has [made Putin]{.mark} even [more
ambitious]{.mark} [and]{.mark} has [encouraged his authoritarian]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark}. Moscow]{.underline} has [expanded its presence in
Africa and the Middle]{.underline} East, while strengthening cooperation
with the likes of China, Iran, and North Korea. This axis of autocrats
is playing an increasingly important role in Russia's war effort. In
recent weeks, the first contingent of approximately [ten thousand North
Korean soldiers joined the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}.
They are unlikely to be the last.

It should now be abundantly clear that [a [Russian victory in
Ukraine]{.mark},]{.underline} no matter how limited, [[would embolden
autocracies worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.mark} [would ignite
a chain]{.mark} [reaction]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [accelerate]{.mark} the
[unraveling of global]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[security]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [[abandoning]{.mark}
[Ukraine]{.mark} would [send a chilling message to all US
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would pave the way for a far more
dangerous world where aggression is met with silence and order gives way
to chaos.

It is not too late to prevent this descent into geopolitical
lawlessness. [[A resolute Western stance]{.mark} on ending the Russian
invasion of Ukraine [can still secure "peace through strength"]{.mark}
[and send]{.mark} a [powerful message]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
[international]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark} [will not be
tolerated]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[failure to do so will
undermine global security and prosperity for years to
come.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### [!\-\--Nuclear Winter\-\--2NC]{.underline}

#### Even 'limited nuclear war' causes nuclear winter.

**Fisher 15**, Foreign Affairs Columnist at VOXMax. (Max, 6/29/15, "How
World War III Became Possible", Vox,
https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war

That is why, analysts will tell you, today\'s tensions bear far more
similarity to the period before World War I: an unstable power balance,
belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments,
disputes over the future of the European order, and dangerous
uncertainty about what actions will and will not force the other party
into conflict. [[Today]{.mark}\'s [Russia]{.mark},]{.underline} once
more the [strongest]{.underline} nation in Europe and yet weaker than
its collective enemies, [[calls]{.mark} [to mind
the]{.mark} turn-of-the-century [German Empire]{.mark},]{.underline}
which Henry Kissinger described as \"too big for Europe, but too small
for the world.\" Now, as then, [[a rising power, propelled by
nationalism, is seeking to revise]{.mark} the [European
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now, as then, it believes that through
superior cunning, and perhaps even by proving its might, it can force a
larger role for itself. [[Now,]{.mark} as then, the
[drift]{.mark}]{.underline} [[toward war is gradual and easy to
miss]{.mark} --- [which]{.mark} [is]{.mark} exactly [what makes it so
dangerous]{.mark}. But]{.underline} there is one way in which today\'s
dangers are less like those before World War I, and more similar to
those of the Cold War: the apocalyptic logic of nuclear
weapons. Mutual [[suspicion]{.mark},]{.underline} fear of
an [[existential threat]{.mark}, [armies parked across
borders]{.mark} from]{.underline} one another, and
hair-trigger [[nuclear weapons all make any]{.mark} small [skirmish a
potential armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some ways, that logic has
grown even more dangerous. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, hoping to
compensate for its conventional military forces\' relative
weakness, [[has]{.mark} dramatically [relaxed its
rules]{.mark} for]{.underline} using nuclear weapons. Whereas Soviet
leaders saw their nuclear weapons as pure deterrents, something that
existed precisely so they would never be used, Putin\'s view appears to
be radically different. Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine calls on the
country to launch a battlefield nuclear strike in case of a conventional
war that could pose an existential threat. These are more than just
words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its willingness and preparations
to use nuclear weapons even in a more limited war. This
is [[a]{.mark} terrifyingly [low bar for nuclear weapons use]{.mark},
particularly given that any war would likely occur along Russia\'s
borders and thus not far from Moscow]{.underline}. And it suggests Putin
has adopted an idea that Cold War leaders considered unthinkable: that a
\"limited\" nuclear war, of small warheads dropped on the battlefield,
could be not only survivable but winnable. \"It's not just a difference
in rhetoric. It's a whole different world,\" Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear
weapons scholar at Princeton, told the Wall Street Journal. He called
Putin\'s decisions more dangerous than those of any Soviet leader since
1962. \"There's a low nuclear threshold now that didn't exist during the
Cold War.\" Nuclear theory is complex and disputable; maybe Putin is
right. But many theorists would say he is wrong, that the logic of
nuclear warfare means [[a \"limited\" nuclear
strike]{.underline}]{.mark} is in fact likely [to [trigger
a]{.mark}]{.underline} larger [[nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a
doomsday scenario in which major American, Russian, and European cities
would be targets for attacks many times more powerful than the bombs
that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even if a nuclear war did somehow
remain [[limited]{.underline}]{.mark} and contained, recent [[studies
suggest that]{.mark} [environmenta]{.mark}]{.underline}[l]{.mark} and
atmospheric [[damage would cause a \"decade of
winter]{.mark}\"]{.underline} and mass crop die-outs that could kill up
to 1 billion people in a global famine.

#### Extinction

**Mulhollem 22**, is an agricultural science researcher and writer at
Penn State. (Jeff, 3-30-2022, "How would a nuclear winter impact food
production?" Penn State,
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220330164525.htm)

The day after lead author Daniel Winstead approved the final proofs for
a study to be published in Ambio, the journal of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences, Russia put its nuclear forces on high alert. \"In
no way, shape or form had I thought that our work \-- \'Food Resilience
in a Dark Catastrophe: A new Way of Looking at Tropical Wild Edible
Plants\' \-- would be immediately relevant while we were working on
it,\" said the research technologist in Penn State\'s College of
Agricultural Sciences. \"In the short term, I viewed it as an abstract
concept.\" Winstead and study co-author Michael Jacobson, professor of
forest resources, had to look back at the Cold War era to get
information for their review. \"So, it did not enter my mind that it
would be something that could happen anytime soon,\" Winstead said.
\"This paper was published during this latest invasion by Russia into
Ukraine, but our work on it began two years ago. The idea that nuclear
war could break out now was unthinkable to me.\" The research
acknowledges what has been widely agreed upon for decades: [In higher
latitude countries]{.underline} \-- [such as]{.underline} [**[nuclear
powers]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[U.S.]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark} \-- [there
would be]{.underline} **[no agricultural production]{.underline}** [and
little food gathering possible]{.underline} [in
a]{.underline} **[nuclear winter]{.underline}** [after an all-out
conflagration]{.underline}. [If warring countries unleashed large
portions of their nuclear
arsenals,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [resulting]{.underline} [global]{.underline}, **[sun-blocking
cloud]{.underline}** [would turn the ground
to]{.underline} **[permafrost]{.underline}**. [A nuclear war would
cause]{.underline} **[global blockage]{.underline}** [of the
sun]{.underline} [for]{.underline} **[several years]{.underline}** [due
to injections of]{.underline} **[black carbon soot]{.underline}** [into
the upper atmosphere]{.underline}, covering most of the planet with
black clouds, the researchers
said. **[Computer]{.underline}** **[models]{.underline}** [predict]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [a
large nuclear war,]{.underline} [primarily between Russia and the
U.S]{.underline}., [could inject upwards of]{.underline} **[165 million
tons]{.underline}** [of soot into the upper atmosphere]{.underline} from
more than 4,000 nuclear bomb explosions and ensuing wildfires. Such [a
nuclear war]{.underline} [could result in]{.underline} less
than **[40%]{.underline}** [of normal
light]{.underline} [levels]{.underline} near the equator [and less than
5% normal light levels near the
poles]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} **[freezing
temperatures]{.underline}** [in
most]{.underline} [temperate]{.underline} [regions
and]{.underline} **[severe precipitation reductions]{.underline}** \--
just half of the worldwide average \-- according to the
study. [Post-catastrophe conditions, which could last]{.underline} **[15
years]{.underline}** in some wet tropical forests such as those in the
Congo and Amazon basins, [could cause a]{.underline} **[90%
reduction]{.underline}** [in precipitation for several years after such
an event]{.underline}. But tropical forests would offer an opportunity
for limited food production and gathering by local inhabitants because,
despite the dense soot clouds, the region would be warmer. In the study,
researchers classified wild, edible plants into seven main categories,
augmented by forest insects: fruits, leafy vegetables, seeds/nuts,
roots, spices, sweets and protein. In a nuclear winter, the study shows,
the following foods would be available in varying degrees in tropical
forests: konjac, cassava, wild oyster mushroom, safou, wild spinaches,
vegetable amaranths, palms, mopane worm, dilo, tamarind, baobab, enset,
acacias, yam and palm weevil. The researchers chose 33 wild, edible
plants from a list of 247 and considered their potential for cultivation
in tropical forests in post-nuclear war conditions. Their selections
were complicated by the fact that in the tropics there are relatively
few food-bearing plants that are both drought tolerant and shade or
low-light tolerant. [Post-catastrophe]{.underline} [conditions would
be]{.underline} **[unlivable]{.underline}** [for humans]{.underline} [in
many areas around the
world]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[agriculture]{.underline}** [may
not be possible]{.underline}, the researchers concluded. This study
shows how just a few of the many tropical wild, edible plants and
insects could be used for short-term emergency food cultivation and
foraging after an atmospheric soot injection from a catastrophic event
such as a nuclear war. The world\'s tropical forests hold many
underutilized crops and resources, Jacobson pointed out. This study
offers a new perspective on global food security and resilience using
forest foods, along with policy and preparedness recommendations. \"But
regardless of the risk of nuclear war, there are numerous other
existential threats, not least being climate change,\" he said.
\"Meeting food security \-- and nutrition \-- in the face of any of
these risks is clearly one of humanity\'s major challenges over the next
decades. To that end, it is imperative that we better understand our
food production, supply and value chains to make them less vulnerable
and more adaptable in times of crises.\" This study is part of a much
larger project, \"Research on Emergency Food Resilience,\" underway at
Penn State. Open Philanthropy provided funding for this work. Much of
the data for this review came from a previous research paper.

On the other hand, Russia through President [[Putin]{.mark} has
[reminded the world]{.mark} that since]{.underline} the beginning  of 
the  war  [there  is  a  possibility  of  using  nuclear  weapons  and 
[Russia  is  moving  its strategic nuclear deterrent force
to]{.mark}]{.underline} a higher stage of readiness. The Russian
offensive took place in large parts of Ukraine. [[Massive
shelling]{.underline}]{.mark} was carried out in various parts of
Ukraine and [[has]{.mark} [damaged many of Ukraine\'s]{.mark} strategic
[infrastructure such as Europe\'s largest nuclear power
plant]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia  told  Ukrainian  civilians  to 
immediately  leave  the  area  along  the  eastern  bank  of  the
Dnieper River in Kherson province. Ukraine considers the order for
Ukrainian citizens to leave its territory an act of forced depopulation
in the territory. The streets of the Russian-controlled port of Kherson
are almost empty of Ukrainian activity, business centers and shops are
closed. The [[United States indicated that North Korea was]{.mark}
[secretly supplying Russia\'s war]{.mark} in Ukraine with large amounts
of artillery shells, then disguised it from arms shipments by trying to
make it appear as if it was being sent to countries in the Middle East
or North]{.underline} Africa. [[Moscow has]{.mark} been forced [to look
for weapons to North Korea and Iran because of]{.mark} [global sanctions
that have limited Russia\'s ability to replenish its
own]{.mark}]{.underline} [[arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}. Iran has also
sent support for self-exploding drone weapons, which have been used in
attacks on Ukraine that have damaged Ukrainian infrastructure. Russian
President  Vladimir  [[Putin  said  the  world]{.mark}  [is]{.mark} 
[currently  facing  the  most  dangerous  situation  since World War
II.]{.mark}]{.underline} Putin [[also accused the United]{.mark} [States
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[inciting conflict in Ukraine
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the West of playing  a dangerous,  bloody and
[[dirty geopolitical game that sows chaos around the
world]{.underline}.]{.mark} Putin thought that it was time for NATO\'s
various waves of expansion to be countered and urged the  alliance  to 
guarantee  that  Ukraine  would  never  be  allowed  to  become  a 
member.  Russia predicts that the [[historical period of
undivided]{.mark} [Western]{.mark}]{.underline} [[domination of world
affairs will end soon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[NATO\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}  attitude  during  the  war  between 
Russia  and  Ukraine  for  now  [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}  by 
[[providing significant military support to Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}
to defend itself, and without being dragged into a conflict that could
lead to war between them and Russia. NATO has so far not projected troop
strength in Ukraine, this is due to fears of a war that will spread,
although some NATO members have sent military  equipment  to  help 
Kyiv.  [[NATO  Secretary  General]{.mark} ]{.underline} Jens 
Stoltenberg  [[is]{.mark}  also [concerned]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about
Russia\'s possible use of weapons of mass]{.mark}
[destruction]{.mark}]{.underline} and accused it of being able to spread
fake news to base its use on chemical weapons. In supporting Ukraine
against the Russian attack, [[NATO  has  alerted  its  troops  of 
140,000  troops]{.mark}  [around]{.mark}]{.underline}  the  territory 
of  [[Ukraine  and  mobilized]{.underline}]{.mark} various 
[[sophisticated  military  equipment.]{.underline}]{.mark}  The  number 
of  troops  itself  consists  of  100,000  US troops stationed in Europe
and another 40,000 troops from various NATO member countries. The
advanced military equipment provided to Ukraine includes the Himars
missile defense system, Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft
guns and various fighter jets and tanks. This was done by NATO in an
effort to provide additional power in Ukrainian territory. NATO\'s role
in Russia\'s war with Ukraine is a form of its national interest towards
other countries as a form of assistance in the field of defense and
security in helping Ukraine against Russia.

[[Conditions  in  Ukraine  have]{.underline}]{.mark}  indirectly 
[[positioned  them  in]{.underline}]{.mark}  a  face-to-face  situation 
with high alert [[between NATO and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
supported by several countries. [[Tensions between NATO and Russia

#### Stalemates are prime for aggression through tech

[[The ground war in Ukraine is now at a
stalemate]{.mark},]{.underline} [a predicament [which is neither a sign
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [impending [defeat]{.mark} [nor]{.mark} an
[unusual occurrence in war]{.mark}.]{.underline} While one aspect of a
war may be "frozen" for a time, wars usually consist of many different
geographic theaters, environments (air, land, sea, space, cyber),
and aspects (economic, psychological, political), whose combination is
what generally determines victory or defeat.  History has shown that
past stalemates in war often cause participants to innovate and create
new tactics and/or technologies and mobilize heretofore untouched
resources to move past stalemate and towards victory.The decision to
provide aid to Ukraine should not depend on what phase this war is in,
even if it is currently a static one. The United States started its
support to the Ukrainian people at their darkest hour when there was
little hope of survival, let alone victory. It should not end it because
the war has not met arbitrary expectations or timelines.

Today's [[stalemate in Ukraine is]{.mark} [the result
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [three [factors]{.mark}:
one [technological,]{.mark} one [topographical]{.mark}, and
one [psychological]{.mark}. ]{.underline}Modern battlefield
surveillance, the topography of southern Ukraine that provides for
minimal concealment, and the fact that both sides view the conflict in
existential terms contribute to the current situation on the
battlefield.  Technological [[The combination
of]{.mark} near-[ubiquitous]{.mark} battlefield [surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline} and
precision-guided munitions [[makes
a]{.mark} modern [battlefield]{.mark} a [dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline} place
to move in. Today's cheap, abundant, and easy-to-use drones provide both
sides a literal bird's eye view of the
battlefield. [[Drones]{.underline}]{.mark}, integrated with other modern
advances (e.g., night vision devices, counter-battery radars, satellite
imagery, etc.) [[provide battlefield]{.mark}
[awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} undreamt of just a generation
before[[. Intelligence,]{.underline} [surveillance,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and reconnaissance (ISR) assets]{.underline}]{.mark}, combined with
precision-guided munitions, and overseen by a well-organized command,
control, and communications network create what the Russians call
a reconnaissance-strike complex . In other words, [[if something can be
seen on]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[battlefield, it can be hit
almost immediately]{.underline}]{.mark}. The world saw this on a smaller
scale in the Second Karabakh War in 2020. Today, it is a central feature
of the war in Ukraine. Topographical This integrated system of
ubiquitous reconnaissance and precision fires is especially effective in
southern Ukraine due to its topography, which provides minimal
concealment. The battlefield is mostly one of large, open fields divided
by tree lines and interspersed with small villages. There are few large
forests making it difficult to assemble troops, hide supply dumps, or
position artillery batteries.

[The Trump administration has repeatedly **threatened to walk away**
from Ukraine if there is no progress on a peace deal between Ukraine and
Russia.]{.underline} Although the administration has sent mixed signals,
its threat is not empty. [On March 3, 2025, the United States
**suspended** military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine following
a tense meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky on
February 28, only lifting the suspension on March 11.]{.underline}

[A U.S. suspension of military support to Ukraine would be **a grievous
blow** to Kyiv.]{.underline} But would it be fatal? Ukraine's own
resolve has been formidable even after three years of war, and Europe,
which already provides tens of billions of euros in financial and
military aid, might play a still greater role. [This paper argues that a
complete U.S. military and intelligence aid cutoff would **significantly
harm Ukraine's ability to fight Russia** but would not necessarily lead
to immediate defeat---and that more limited cutoffs would have more
limited effects on Ukraine's battlefield performance. But the exact
extent to which a U.S. cutoff would harm Ukraine depends on Europe's
ability to fill the gap with its own capabilities. Ukraine currently
relies heavily on U.S. systems, training, intelligence, and logistics,
and although European support and Ukraine's own defense industry are
substantial and growing, they cannot fully replace U.S.
capabilities---particularly in the areas of air defense and intelligence
assistance for precision targeting. The result is that continued U.S.
aid remains **extremely important** for Ukraine's long-term
effectiveness on the battlefield]{.underline}Understanding the true
impact of a cutoff, however, requires a deeper understanding of the
types of weapons involved, European and Ukrainian capabilities absent
the United States, and how China and other Russian allies would respond.
The responses to the seven questions below illustrate the impact of a
cutoff, important ambiguities regarding several key specifics of the
U.S. threat, and the possibilities and limits of non-U.S. sources of
aid. [Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
the United States has committed \$66.5 billion in military assistance to
bolster Ukraine's defense as well as over \$50 billion in financial aid.
Although destined for Ukraine, 90 percent of this military aid consists
of money spent in the United States to build new weapons or to replace
weapons sent to Ukraine from U.S. stockpiles. Across all U.S. aid to
Ukraine, 60 percent is spent in the United States, about 25 percent is
spent in Ukraine, and the final 15 percent is spent
elsewhere.]{.underline}

U.S. aid has been delivered through multiple channels---primarily
Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative (USAI), and Foreign Military Financing (FMF)---enabling both
immediate deliveries to the battlefield and longer-term defense capacity
building. The United States has also facilitated third-party transfers
and commercial sales while coordinating with allies, who have
contributed great quantities of additional military systems and
munitions. The United States has also provided extensive training to
Ukraine's armed forces since Russia's invasion, helping improve
everything from small unit tactics and logistics to leadership
development and combined arms operations. In addition, U.S. personnel
have delivered platform-specific instruction on systems such as M777
howitzers, Patriot air defense batteries, Bradley infantry fighting
vehicles, HIMARS rocket launchers, and F-16 fighter jets. These efforts
have been conducted through various channels, often in coordination with
NATO and via rotational deployments of U.S. Army and National Guard
units to training sites in Europe.

In addition to military equipment and training, the United States has
provided Ukraine with extensive intelligence support, including signals
intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), and human
intelligence (HUMINT). This support has enabled Ukraine to counter
missile barrages, disrupt covert operations, and track force movements.
Notably, U.S. intelligence has played a pivotal role in Ukraine's
targeting processes for precision strikes, particularly for
precision-guided systems like HIMARS. [Reports indicate that Ukrainian
forces rely heavily on U.S.-provided coordinates for the majority of
their strikes conducted with advanced weapons systems, underscoring the
extent to which the United States has been integrated into Ukraine's
"kill chain"---the process of identifying, tracking, and eliminating
targets using a mix of sensors and platforms.]{.underline}

U.S. support for Ukraine also extends beyond battlefield tools and
intelligence, encompassing military planning, and long-term capacity
building. [The United States has worked closely with Ukraine to
coordinate its battlefield strategy and objectives, boost its cyber
defenses, tackle corruption, sustain its economy, build its defense
industrial capacity, and plan for recovery. The United States also
manages transportation and logistics for aid to Ukraine.]{.underline}

Should the Trump administration decide to end aid to Ukraine, much will
depend on the specifics of what "end" means in practice. [A cutoff could
range from an **abrupt halt to all assistance,** including preventing
allies from providing any support involving U.S. systems, to a more
limited, but still painful, cutoff of future transfers by the United
States. There are a range of scenarios with varying implications for
Ukraine's security.]{.underline}

#### Ceasefire impossible. 

**Pazzanese 25**, Staff Write at the Harvard Gazette. (Christina, 2/24,
"Whare the Prospects for Ukraine? Former top Ukranian Diplomat says
Options Appear Narrow as U.S. Aggressively Pushes for Ceasefire Deal
with Russia". The Harvard Gazette,
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/02/what-are-the-prospects-for-ukraine/)

[Three years after Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S. is now aggressively
pushing both countries to reach a ceasefire deal. But critics of the
Trump administration as well as most European nations are asking: **At
what price to Ukraine?**]{.underline} Earlier this month, President
Trump, who has falsely suggested Ukraine started the war, spoke
privately by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a series of
topics including Ukraine. And U.S. and Russian officials last week held
preliminary discussions on peace talks without a representative from
Ukraine present.

The U.S. has proposed a deal in which Ukraine would divert \$500 billion
in rare-earth mineral profits to Washington in exchange for aid but
without a security guarantee. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky,
falsely attacked by Trump as a "dictator," has thus far refused to sign
the accord. On Monday, the Trump administration voted against a United
Nations resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine and
calling for the withdrawal of Russian forces. U.S. diplomats introduced
a resolution calling solely for an end to the conflict. Both measures
passed. In this edited conversation held before the U.N. vote, Dmytro
Kuleba, Ukraine's chief diplomat from 2020 to 2024 and now a senior
fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the
Harvard Kennedy School, shares his views on the war and Ukraine's
future.mIn December, you said you remained optimistic about Ukraine's
position. How do you feel today? Less optimistic. I personally, and
Ukraine as a whole, we underestimated the pressure that Trump and his
administration will begin to exert on Ukraine given his desire to strike
a quick deal. We believed, based on our experience with President Trump
during his first tenure, that he would be more balanced toward both
Ukraine and Russia in this under these circumstances. French President
Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, plan to
bring a proposal to the White House this week that would install 30,000
European troops in Ukraine to provide security, with the U.S. providing
only backup support, possibly in the form of air and missile defense. If
it comes to fruition, would that be enough to deter Russia? Look at the
size of Ukraine. Disperse 30,000 troops across the map, and you will see
that it's peanuts. [The front line in the Russia-Ukraine war is
essentially 3,000 kilometers \[about 1,860 miles\] long. Thirty thousand
troops will not suffice to cover that line and that means they cannot
serve as peacekeepers in the traditional understanding of this concept
because they **will not be able to stand between Russian and Ukrainian
armies to prevent them from fighting.**]{.underline}

[So, we should **not** consider this idea as a real means of
guaranteeing disengagement of forces. It is not a security guarantee; it
is not even a security assurance, nor a stabilization force. It is just
reassuring presence on the ground. Is the presence of such troops a good
idea in principle? It is. Is it a real means of stopping the war? No, it
isn't.]{.underline}

We have to be realistic. Ukraine's army is 1 million strong. About
400,000 troops are actively engaged in combat on both sides. Thirty
thousand troops, even supported by air cover, can change very little.
[The second thing is that Russia most likely will be vehemently against
this idea because, in their eyes, it will be the legitimization of at
least some NATO armies on the ground in Ukraine.]{.underline} So, it's a
good idea, but I just don't see how it can help to end the war.
Ukraine's room for maneuvering is extremely narrow, to say the least.
The main problem here is purely diplomatic. [Russia has many gestures it
can make to please or to engage with Trump and to show their
constructiveness which are unrelated to the war itself. They released a
U.S. citizen, which is, of course, welcome. This allowed President Trump
to project strength and to demonstrate that **a new attitude toward
Russia pays off.**]{.underline}

[Ukraine **does not have that luxury.** Everything Ukraine has to offer
or can do is related to the war. This puts Russia and Ukraine in
completely different positions vis-a-vis Trump and his administration.
This is the problem that Zelensky is facing.]{.underline}

Two hundred something drones attacked Ukraine just a couple of days ago.
Did we hear a word of condemnation coming from the United States? No, we
didn't. [This is what Putin will continue to do. He will continue to do
something for Trump that does not slow down the pace of his aggression
against Ukraine, and Zelensky will continue to fight against the unfair
agreement **without** having anything else to suggest to Trump as **an
alt**ernative. This is kind of the deadlock that **Ukraine is currently
in.**]{.underline}

Will or should Zelensky step down if it brings about an acceptable
agreement, as he's offered?

We should be very clear: Ceasefire is not the end of the war. To the
credit of the Trump administration, they have a very reasonable goal to
establish a ceasefire as potentially a precondition to ending the war.
But they're only focused on this.

 [The reality is that establishing ceasefire is possible, but very
difficult. Making it hold would be **close to impossible,** and ending
the war is **not looming on the horizon.**]{.underline} Two completely
different strategic goals.

Trump wants a ceasefire as a manifestation of his strengths and ability
to strike the most difficult, challenging deal. [Putin may agree to
that, but his strategic goal of defeating Ukraine will remain
**unchanged.**]{.underline} How to prevent him from doing that is not
where the thinking of U.S. and Western strategists is --- they did not
really go that far. If, by the way, the notion of the West is still
relevant at all.

Territory, money, and membership for Ukraine in NATO are the main issues
on the negotiating table. What's the best outcome Ukraine can hope for
if the U.S. won't provide further support?

Although I'm not a part of the government anymore, I'm still Ukrainian,
and I cannot dwell on what kind of concessions Ukraine could make
because that would simply weaken Ukraine's position. If Ukraine could be
assured that there is a chance that putting NATO and territory issues on
hold without legally recognizing that they are off the table, and Putin
would stick to that agreement, that could work. [The problem is that
everything we know about Russia suggests that it's not going to stick to
its word, and it will use any kind of pause or break just to prepare for
the new attempt to destroy Ukraine.]{.underline} The issue is there is
zero trust in Putin. Trump and his people manifest their belief that
Putin can be trusted, and an agreement is possible, but everything we
know about him suggests the opposite. Would it be wise for Ukraine to
consider ceding portions of its territory to Russia in exchange for an
end to hostilities? [Putin's goal remains **unchange**d. He wants **the
whole of Ukraine.**]{.underline}

As of the writing of this article, [[American

[two]{.mark}]{.underline} [[combatants]{.underline} **[is so
exhausted]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[as [to be unable]{.mark} [to
wage]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This has been demonstrated by
Russia's indifference to American entreaties and Ukraine's refusal to
formally cede any of its territorial integrity. [[Based on]{.mark} the
[will]{.mark} [and resources]{.mark}]{.underline} of both warring
parties and the uncertainty at this juncture of a negotiated settlement,
**[[the Russo-Ukrainian War is likely to continue]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[into the indefinite future]{.underline}.

President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} administration has
[[invested]{.underline}]{.mark} considerable time, effort, and
**[[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital]{.underline}** trying
[[to]{.underline} [end this war]{.underline}.]{.mark} However, **[[it is
possible that a "deal]{.mark}"]{.underline}** that both warring parties
can agree on [to stop]{.underline} the war in Ukraine **[[does not
exist]{.mark},]{.underline}** and the [conditions]{.underline} that
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} wants [[will weaken]{.mark}
[US]{.mark}]{.underline} [[national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
its zeal for a deal, the administration must be careful not to
strengthen America's enemies or weaken itself. [[The]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will not be
safer]{.underline}]{.mark} if [it creates a stronger Russia and a
venturous China]{.underline}. [America]{.underline} **[has the
power]{.underline}** to bring peace to Ukraine, not [by]{.underline}
trying to balance between two implacable foes, but by [making sure one
wins]{.underline} and the other loses for the United States' benefit.

The Russo-Ukrainian War

[[The war]{.underline}]{.mark} between Russia and Ukraine [[is]{.mark}
not [over]{.mark} territory but [national identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin]{.mark} [wants]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[destroy]{.mark} [Ukrain]{.mark}ian national
identity]{.underline}**---the sense that Ukrainians are distinct from
Russians and consequently free to make their own way in the world
separate from Moscow. Ukrainians are fighting to affirm their distinct
identity. Both [[the Kremlin]{.mark} and Kyiv [see]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[war]{.underline} [as]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[existential
conflict,]{.underline}]{.mark}** even as a "holy war," and are prepared
to fight for years to achieve victory.

This is why [[negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[are unlikely to
bring]{.mark} an [enduring peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} It
[would require either Putin to]{.underline} [acknowledge]{.underline}
[Ukraine's]{.underline} **[right to exist]{.underline}** separate from
Russia and return territory, including Crimea, or Ukraine to acknowledge
Russian suzerainty. **[[Negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}** are also
**[[unlikely to bring a ceasefire]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.mark}
more [than]{.mark} a [short period of time]{.mark}.]{.underline} Neither
side can give up. [Both sides face great military and
economic]{.underline} [challenges]{.underline}. The outcome of the war
may depend on which side can last until those challenges collapse the
other from within.

### UQ\-\--Russia Stalemate\-\--2AC

#### Putin says no -- eliminates his power grab and can't 'save' the economy

Russia should be eager to accept a ceasefire that keeps its territorial
gains and reduces sanctions. Why then does it keep fighting? The primary
reason is that **[[Putin]{.mark} [likely]{.mark} [believes]{.mark}
[stopping the war without]{.mark}]{.underline}** achieving his [[war
aims]{.underline}]{.mark} would **[[threaten]{.mark} his [hold]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [power]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[Putin's goals]{.underline} have been clear since the beginning of the
war: [the subjugation of Ukraine and formal]{.underline}
[recognition]{.underline} by NATO [of Russia's sphere of
influence]{.underline} in the former Warsaw Pact states and Soviet
republics. For this, Putin has sacrificed a million Russian men, killed
or maimed, and has substantially weakened Russia's civilian economy.
**[[Putin]{.mark} [must present to the Russian]{.mark}
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both the general population and the
elites, a victory that consecrates these losses into a tangible gain for
all. [**[To accept]{.underline}** **[less]{.underline}**]{.mark} would
**[[create an unstable domestic situation]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
could threaten his hold on power.

[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} is on a treadmill he [[cannot]{.mark} [get
off]{.mark} [until]{.mark}]{.underline} [[he]{.mark}
[achieves]{.mark}]{.underline} his [[goal of turning Kyiv into a
satrap]{.underline}.]{.mark} Russia's 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine
have turned the two countries, formerly close in terms of history,
culture, linguistics, trade, and even intermarriage, into implacable
enemies. By seizing 20 percent of Ukraine, Russia has ensured that the
main national sentiment uniting Ukrainians for generations will be the
recovery of their territory. This happened after the Franco-Prussian War
of 1870--1871 when the loss of Alsace-Lorraine made revanche against
Germany a national goal across France's political spectrum. Therefore[,
**[a ceasefire]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[along a 600-mile front
line]{.underline}]{.mark}** [will [require]{.mark} [maintaining]{.mark}
a [large Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} [[army]{.underline}]{.mark} there
[to protect its conquest.]{.underline}

[[Manning]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[army will not be
easy.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} army has only
[been]{.underline} [able to fill]{.underline} its ranks for three years
via [the one-time expedient of emptying its prisons]{.underline} and by
offering recruits from Russia's impoverished hinterlands exorbitant
bonuses and death benefits. Thus, for many poor Russians, it became
a reasonable economic decision to risk likely death or dismemberment and
enlist. Recently, even these measures have not provided enough manpower,
forcing Moscow to hire North Korean mercenaries. Russia's quid pro quo
to Kim Jong Un for this is still unknown but likely quite costly.

[With a ceasefire]{.underline}, [Russia will not need as many
recruits]{.underline} for its army of occupation since it will not be
suffering 30,000--40,000 casualties monthly. [However,]{.underline} can
it maintain the same financial incentives to attract recruits once the
shooting stops? Will it [instead be [forced to send conscripts to man
the 600-mile front line]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as protect the
other hundreds of miles of Russia's border with Ukraine? Soldiers
currently at the front will want to be demobilized after a ceasefire.
While their demands are unlikely to be met immediately, how long can
they be kept on active service, and where will their replacements come
from? [[The only way for Putin]{.underline} **[to
solve]{.underline}**]{.mark} this dilemma **[[is to
ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[Ukraine can never
threaten]{.underline} [Russia's conquests]{.underline},]{.mark} and for
this, he needs to install a pliable government in Kyiv. Until then, he
must recruit, support, and pay for an army of occupation, larger than
any force Ukraine can field, for years or decades to come.

[[Russia]{.underline} [must]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[army]{.mark}
[maintains]{.mark}]{.underline} at least **[[parity in weapons and
ammunition]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since [during]{.underline} a
[ceasefire]{.underline} the [[Russian]{.mark} army [would no longer be
expending ammunition]{.mark}]{.underline} or losing equipment, this
would seem an easy task. [[However]{.mark},]{.underline} Russia's
[[production]{.underline}]{.mark} of armored vehicles [[is
hamstrung]{.mark} by]{.underline} Western [sanctions]{.underline} and
the limitations of its industrial base. [The [war]{.mark}]{.underline}
has [[forced Russia to use]{.mark} up]{.underline} its seemingly
[[inexhaustible reserves]{.underline}]{.mark} of Soviet-era weapons.
Those reserves are now almost gone. [While
[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} [[ammunition]{.underline}]{.mark}
production [[is greater]{.mark}]{.underline} than the West's and it [has
received large amounts of ammunition]{.underline}, drones, and ballistic
missiles **[[from North Korea and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Russia
will have to decide how much it can spend on bullets and on butter in
the wake of a ceasefire.

#### Trump's new approach guarantees Ukrainian Concessions

intel and weapons for Ukraine bring Zelenskyy and Putin closer to peace,

[[The CIA
chief [confirmed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-has-halted-sharing-intelligence-ukraine-cia-director-john-ratcliffe/)]{.underline}]{.mark} Wednesday
that the [[Trump admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration had
[[paused]{.underline}]{.mark} not only **[the flow of [military
hardware]{.mark}]{.underline}** and financial support to Ukraine, but
**[[also vital intelligence]{.mark} [gathering]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} has helped [Kyiv anticipate]{.underline} [and
block]{.underline} [incoming missile]{.underline} and drone attacks and
effectively target Russia\'s invading forces. The U.S. military\'s
European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on
their way --- approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered
--- have been paused. 

The [pause]{.underline} is [[part of]{.underline}]{.mark} President
[**[Trump\'s abrupt shift]{.underline}** in]{.mark} policy on Ukraine,
[[which]{.mark} has [seen]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[White House [adopt
rhetoric closely aligned with Russia\'s
narrative](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-ukraine-started-war-despite-russia-invasion-blames-zelenskyy/)]{.mark} j]{.underline}ustifying
the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. [[Trump\'s bid to
pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} Ukrainian President Volodymyr
[Zelenskyy]{.underline} to accept a ceasefire deal that could
**[[involve significant concessions by Kyiv.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington
moderated by CBS News\' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump\'s special envoy to
Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a
necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House\'s determination to
forge a peace deal. 

\"The [best way I can describe]{.underline} it is [like hitting a mule
with a two-by-four across]{.underline} [their noses]{.underline} --- we
got their attention,\" he said. \"But it\'s a pause, it\'s not an end.
It\'s then up to them.\" 

Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would
not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming.
I told them.\" 

\"**[[If you take away support]{.underline}]{.mark}** like that, of
course **[[it\'s important]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" said Kellogg, a
retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that\'s why
it was done.\" 

[[Trump admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration officials have
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir [[Putin will also have to
make]{.underline}]{.mark} [[concessions]{.underline}]{.mark} to bring
about a ceasefire, **[but [those have not been
outlined]{.mark}]{.underline}** by the White House to date. To even
engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr.
Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S.
access to a major share of [Ukraine\'s mineral
resources](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-trump-minerals-russia-war-rare-earths-deal/). 

Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential 

[[Zelenskyy\'s reluctance]{.underline}]{.mark} to sign an economic deal
thus far, [without clear]{.underline} [guarantees]{.underline} that it
would come [with a commitment from the U.S.]{.underline} to help defend
Ukraine from further Russian attack, **[[appeared to enrage Mr.
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** during their [chaotic Oval Office
meeting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-trump-zelenskyy/) on
Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business
investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by
default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr[.
**[Trump]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[has [said]{.mark}
himself]{.underline}** that[**[ [he trusts
Russia](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-uk-keir-starmer-ukraine-war-russia-europe-tariffs/)]{.mark}** ]{.underline}to
keep any promises it makes. 

**[[Ukraine and America\'s European allies do not]{.mark} trust Putin\'s
Russia]{.underline}**. They note that as the Biden administration warned
of Russia\'s looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in
Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions. 

#### Concessions are in Russia's favor

**Taylor and Dixon 25**, \*Foreign Reporter with a MA from Columbia
University Graduate School of Journalism, \*\*Moscow Bureau Chief and
Foreign Correspondent (\*Adam, \*\*Robyn, 3/25, "Russia Wins Concession
in U.S.-Led Talks with Grain Export Deal", Washington Post, ,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/25/russia-ukraine-black-sea-exports/)

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates on
Tuesday [[agreed]{.underline} **[to help Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark}
sell its grain and fertilizer on the world market.

The **[[concession]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a long-standing Kremlin
demand, which [[drew]{.mark} [pushback]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [Ukrainian
officials]{.mark}]{.underline}, [came alongside a U.S.-brokered
agreement between]{.underline} **[Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}** to
expand a limited ceasefire to include the Black Sea, as the Trump
administration pushes for a more comprehensive deal.

[[The grain]{.mark} [and fertilizer agreement]{.mark},]{.underline}
announced in a White House statement after U.S.-led negotiations with
Russia in Saudi Arabia, came as other agreements were made related to
safe navigation in the Black Sea, a vital shipping route by which both
Russia and Ukraine reach the Mediterranean.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has claimed that it
has struggled to access gain export markets. In the past, Western
officials responded by saying that there were no formal sanctions on the
goods and that Russian exports had continued at high levels.

Andrey Sizov, managing director at research firm SovEcon, which tracks
the Black Sea grain market, said Tuesday that the U.S. announcement was
"surprising," as Russian food and fertilizer exports had hit "record
highs since the war began." Data collected by SovEcon showed Russian
grain exports hitting 71 million metric tons in the 2023-2024 season,
compared to just 42 million in 2021-2022.

"**[[Looks like another nod to Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Sizov
wrote on X, adding that the move could [[indicate]{.mark} that [U.S.
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} on Rosselkhozbank, a state-owned
agricultural bank, [[would be lifted.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [[Kremlin said]{.mark}]{.underline} Tuesday that [it would
implement]{.underline} the agreements reached in Saudi Arabia [only if
the West lifted]{.underline} "sanctions on Rosselkhozbank and other
financial institutions that provide operations in international trade in
food, fishery products and fertilizers."

"This includes connecting Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT," the Kremlin added,
referring to the global payment system based in Belgium.

**[The language on U.S. support]{.underline}** for Russian grain exports
was not included in a separate White House statement detailing the
results of U.S. negotiations with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. [Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky said that [the issue had not been on the
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} for those meetings and that **[[Kyiv did not
support]{.mark} [it.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"We believe [that would **[weaken our position and the sanctions
regime," Zelensky said]{.mark}**]{.underline} at a news conference.

says not told U.S. halting military aid, as Russia intensifies attack",
Washington Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/02/us-ukraine-weapons-halted-air-defense/>)

KYIV --- [[Ukrainian officials]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[scrambled]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to clarify]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[situation]{.underline}]{.mark} Wednesday [[after]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [announced]{.mark}]{.underline}
that **[[it was halting deliveries]{.underline}]{.mark}** of air defense
munitions [to Ukraine]{.underline} --- weapons that Ukraine desperately
needs as Russia pummels the country with unprecedented waves of aerial
attacks.

[[Ukraine's]{.mark} [Defense Ministry said]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[**[it had "not received any official]{.underline}**
**[notifications]{.underline}**]{.mark}" about the "suspension or
revision of the delivery schedules[" for]{.underline} [U.S. military
assistance]{.underline} and had requested a phone conversation "to
further clarify the details," the statement said.

Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a statement there were "reports
of delays in the delivery" of "certain elements" of military aid
packages.

[[Ukraine's]{.underline}]{.mark} Foreign Ministry [summoned the [top
official]{.mark} at the U.S. Embassy]{.underline} in Kyiv and
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} afterward that "**[[any
delay]{.underline}]{.mark}** or slowing down in supporting Ukraine's
defense capabilities would **[[only]{.mark} [encourage the
aggressor]{.mark} [to continue]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[war and
terror]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[rather than seek
peace]{.underline}**."

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its part, [[welcomed]{.mark} the
[news about a suspension in weapons deliveries.]{.mark}]{.underline}
"The less weapons are supplied to Ukraine the closer the end of the
special military operation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said,
referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. Defense Department decided to halt some shipments to Ukraine
after a review found American military stockpiles to be low, White House
spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement emailed to U.S. media
outlets.

"This decision was made to put America's interests first following a
review of our nation's military support and assistance to other
countries across the globe," she said.

The announcement comes as Russia has launched a summer offensive into
Ukraine, especially in the eastern region.

President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} recently
[[indicated]{.underline}]{.mark} [[he might supply
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} with Patriot missiles, a system that the
Ukrainians need to repel Russian ballistic missile attacks.

[[American]{.mark} [officials]{.mark} [did not specify]{.mark} [which
weapons]{.mark} [were being]{.mark}
[halted]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but news reports indicated that
they could include air defense systems, which had been allocated to
Ukraine by the previous Biden administration.

[[After the U.S. struck Iran]{.mark},]{.underline} some [[European
officials expressed concern]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[decide]{.mark} [to divert air
defenses]{.mark} planned for Ukraine [to the Middle]{.mark}
[East.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[launched]{.mark} [massive waves of
drones]{.mark}]{.underline} and missiles against Ukraine in the last few
weeks --- **[attacks that are [increasing in
intensity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In June alone, Russia sent more than
5,000 self-detonating drones crashing into Ukrainian cities, with
substantial civilian casualties.

On Sunday, [[Ukrainian officials]{.underline} [said Russian]{.underline}
[forces **pounded Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the largest air
assault ofnthe war, firing 537 drones and missiles at locations across
the country.

Ukraine has been pushing repeatedly in international forums for
increased air defense capabilities to defend itself against the
onslaught. At a [NATO summit last
week](https://archive.is/o/O2eTd/https:/www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/24/ukraine-military-aid-us-trump/),
Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines and said Washington could try
to find more air defense for Kyiv.

"They do want to have the antimissile missiles. Okay. As they call them.
The Patriots. And, we're going to see if we can make some available.
Yeah, they're very hard to get. We need them, too," Trump said during a
news conference.

[[Trump's administration]{.underline} **[appears
divided]{.underline}**]{.mark} on the issue of the war, with
[some]{.underline} members [pushing for closer relations]{.underline},
especially commercial, with Russia, while others have seen Ukraine as
the victim of foreign aggression.

Economic Council and the framework for action on black carbon and

their differences, it seemed possible that the EU would at last receive
formal observer status to the Council at the Iqaluit meeting, but
[Russia\'s geostrategic interests led Moscow to block]{.underline} the
process. Given the growing number of observers, the US chair may propose
that only one third of observers join high-level AC meetings under any
one chair.

[[Russia's invasion of Ukraine marked]{.mark} a geopolitical tipping
point and the [end]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Arctic
[exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 It drove a wedge between Russia,
on one hand, and the other seven Arctic states (the Arctic Seven), on
the other. On March 3, 2022, just eight days after Russia's invasion,
the Arctic Seven paused the work of the Arctic Council.
[[Although]{.mark} [three months later]{.mark}, on June 8, 2022[, they
authorized]{.mark} the [resumption]{.mark} of work [on]{.mark} Arctic
[Council projects]{.mark} [not involving]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n
Federation, pan-Arctic cooperation remains a pipe dream.]{.underline}
Today the Arctic Seven---Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States---face competing imperatives. On
one hand, [[there is]{.mark} the [need for cooperation, stability, and
security in the Arctic. All]{.mark} Arctic states [have]{.mark} an
[interest in avoiding military encounters]{.mark} in the Arctic that
risk escalation. [Cooperation, stability, and security]{.mark} [are

inhabitants, particularly their Indigenous Peoples; in dealing with
search and rescue emergencies; in responding to oil spills; in
developing effective [region-wide approaches to]{.mark} environmental
and climate change [challenges]{.mark}; and in ensuring sustainable
resource development]{.underline}. On the other hand, there is a need to
hold the Russian Federation accountable for its egregious violation of
international law in waging war on Ukraine. How, in light of these
competing imperatives, can and should the Arctic Seven, their Indigenous
Peoples, and Arctic experts best ensure the health, peace, and security
of the Arctic?

European Aid Increase Barely Offsets U.S. Standstill

[[European support for Ukraine]{.mark} [rose]{.mark} [sharply]{.mark} in
March and April]{.underline}. In just two months, Europe allocated EUR
10.4 billion in military aid and EUR 9.8 billion in humanitarian and
financial aid. This represents [[the highest combined total for any
two-month period since the start of the war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[This comes as the United States, formerly Ukraine's largest donor, has
not announced any new aid since early January]{.underline}]{.mark}. With
U.S. contributions stalled, the key question is whether Europe can fill
the gap.

The [[latest data suggest that Europe has largely done]{.mark}
[so]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least in financial terms. Average monthly
aid from January to April 2025 slightly surpassed the 2022--2024
average.

(Chart removed)

\"It is remarkable that [[Europe has filled the
gap]{.underline}]{.mark},\" says Christoph Trebesch, head of the Ukraine
Support Tracker. \"It remains to be seen whether this is a temporary
spike or the beginning of a more lasting shift in Europe's role as the
main supporter of Ukraine.\"

European Surge Driven by a Few Countries

The latest data show that [[Europe's recent aid surge has been driven by
a small group of countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nordic nations stand
out, with Sweden allocating EUR 1.6 billion in March and
[[Norway]{.mark} [allocating]{.mark} EUR [670 million]{.mark} in
April---[record monthly figures for both]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
In total[, [Nordic]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} [increased]{.mark} their
aid [by EUR 5.8 billion between January and April
2025.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Among larger European economies, the [[United Kingdom has stepped up as
well]{.mark},]{.underline} allocating EUR 4.5 billion so far this year.
Of that amount, EUR 1.8 billion came from frozen Russian assets rather
than new budget spending. France has contributed EUR 2.2 billion,
including nearly EUR 195 million from frozen assets. EU institutions
also played a major role, allocating EUR 12.2 billion during the same
period.

Q3: How will these attacks affect peace talks?

A3: [The [only constant in the Kremlin's playbook is
**violenc**e]{.mark}. Moscow is buying time for further battlefield
gains]{.underline}. Putin [signals
openness](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/11/putin-proposes-direct-peace-talks-with-ukraine-after-3-years-of-war.html) to
diplomacy, including pointing
out [Istanbul](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-role-can-turkey-play-ukraine-negotiations) as
the venue for "direct" talks. But at the same time, [[he **orders

delegation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-zelensky-ceasefire-trump.html)[ to
peace talks]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

The pattern held over the weekend. Hours after [President Trump's phone
call](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403585/trump-calls-putin-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-talks) with

date]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [strike was calibrated violence, a
reminder that the Kremlin can rais]{.mark}e]{.underline}---or
lower---[[the pain]{.underline}]{.mark} threshold at will. Trump
publicly condemned the attack, but the message from Moscow was
unmistakable: Battlefield momentum underwrites bargaining power.

We can expect more of the same. After Turkish Foreign Minister
Hakan Fidan [visited](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/28/turkey-says-its-ready-to-host-russia-ukraine-talks-as-trump-warns-putin-against-further-es) Moscow,
the Kremlin proposed a [second round of direct
talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-proposes-ukraine-date-venue-peace-talks-expects-reply-2025-05-28/).
Although we can expect an increase in periodic meetings towards peace,
there is no reason to assume a matching lull in missile salvos. [[In
Putin's strategy, sustained coercion is not a negotiating chip to be
traded away as a goodwill gesture; it is the very leverage he intends to
bring to the table.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [[disappointment]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[growing]{.underline}]{.mark} in Ukraine [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[lack of urgency]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[among]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}
and their limited support to Ukraine, as well as what is seen as a meek
reaction to the growing involvement of North Korea. If [[Ukraine\'s
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[continue to turn a blind
eye]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[the arrival of North Korean soldiers on
European soil]{.mark}, reality [may]{.mark} one day \"[knock painfully
on their door]{.mark},\"]{.underline} Andriy Yermak, head of Volodymyr
Zelenskyy\'s presidential office, stressed on Saturday[. His reaction
followed [the report by Ukraine's military intelligence of the arrival
of 7,000 troops from Russia's ally to the border between the
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"[Russia]{.underline} is not crossing
your red lines - it is [walking down a red carpet]{.underline}. A
carpet, woven from weak responses, unfounded hopes, and complacency,\"
Sergiy Kyslytsya, Permanent Representative at the UN, also warned at the
Security Council meeting this week. Growing uncertainty Endorsing
Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Victory Plan would be the best response to the
growing alliance between Russia and North Korea, Oleksandr Volodymyr
Merezhko, head of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee and deputy
of the governmental party, told EFE. However, at least two of its key
provisions (immediately inviting Ukraine to join NATO and allowing it to
strike Russia's territory with Western missiles) have been met with
skepticism by the United States and Germany, among some other allies.
Moreover[, only]{.underline} [10%]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [60
billion]{.underline} in military aid promised by the US over six months
ago [has been delivered to]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline} so far,
President Zelenskyy revealed in an interview this week[[. The feeling
that]{.mark} (despite all the assurances[) support for Ukraine is
becoming less of a strategic priority for the allies is
worryin]{.mark}g]{.underline}, Taras, a soldier with the 24th Brigade of
the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told EFE. While assistance from abroad is
crucial to Ukraine's chances of defending itself from Russia, the
constant lack of certainty about its future makes military planning very
complicated. As an example, Ukrainian commanders constantly face the
dilemma of whether they can use the available artillery shells to repel
Russian attacks and save more lives of their soldiers now or use them
sparingly in case new deliveries take more than expected. "If we were
certain that we would get the necessary support for several years, it
would change the situation dramatically," Taras underlined. [The allies
may have acquired a false sense of security after Ukraine dealt some
heavy blows to Russia at the start of the invasion, he
suggested.]{.underline} The cost of supporting Ukraine now is much lower
than what it would be if [[Russia prevails]{.mark} [and the trust in the
promises from the West is undermined]{.mark}]{.underline}, he
underlined. [Morale affected by limited support Taras highlighted that
the lack of certainty about allied support affects troop morale amid
Russia\'s slow but steady progress on parts of the front
line.]{.underline} PDF GENERATED BY PROQUEST.COM Page 1 of 3 "It is very
important for us to know that we are not alone in this struggle," he
said. "We feel the support from abroad through humanitarian aid and
funding and are very grateful," Emilia Jutkovska, a psychologist from
Kherson, told EFE[. However, more [locals are getting tired and losing
belief]{.mark} in victory a[mid]{.mark} [intensified Russian drone and
artillery attacks against civilians]{.mark}]{.underline}. "More people
are doubting our victory because the partners are giving weapons with
delays and don't allow us to use it where we need it," she added. The
locals continue to fight, but they are afraid of failing to liberate the
Russian-occupied territories and of never seeing their families who
remain there. Time to act Despite its problems, Ukraine shares the same
values of democracy and freedom of speech that its allies do, Taras
said. "I would not like this world to shrink because someone is afraid
to fight for it," he underlined, noting that the West should not
overestimate the capabilities of the alliance of authoritarian
countries.
