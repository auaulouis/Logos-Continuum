### Notes

This file further responds to cards defending T-minerals in a previous
supplement. Everything here is affirmative.

I'm not sure any of the evidence here is necessary. There are no
exclusive T-minerals definitions in the context of the Arctic. Those
that have been labeled as such refer to a handful of statutes about
minerals that are defining exploration or development [as it relates to
minerals]{.underline}, for the narrow purpose of [those
statutes]{.underline} (and none are about the Arctic). So, your answer
to all of it is basically the same. Maybe you need evidence to
demonstrate that, but I doubt it.

#### Ryan / Branson / Intrator evidence

You (and the negative) shouldn't be reading quotes from former debaters
about debate theory, because everyone here has a brain they can use
instead. It's much better to go to the original source for each and read
them and then craft them into your own arguments. Neither Branson nor
Ryan is more authoritative than whatever your opinion is about debate.

I'm turning out the Ryan quote only because some judges' RFDs could be
"I thought the Branson quote was better than your explanation of
predictability," so if you think you need a card, you have it. But
seriously, [don't read the card in a debate, instead read the
article]{.underline} and use it to make your own arguments -- the link
is in the cite.

Branson's writing about using PICs to narrow topics, not topicality, and
would never say that the debate should be decided on a random
interpretation not in the context of the topic. The quote in the
previous supplement concludes in the middle of the paragraph.

Here is the full context of his argument about generating sustainable
policy expertise:

He's not writing about topicality at all here, but he does call into
question other debate arguments widely practiced today.

Intrator just says you don't have to 'think outside the box' to solve
problems. It doesn't make an argument about choosing between types of
limits. The resolution itself is a limit, as is your
counter-interpretation. This card isn't relevant.

#### Also about the Mining Loan Fund

**Gorsuch '82** \[Norman and Martha A. Fox; December 17; Attorney
General and Assistant Attorney General of Alaska; Informal Opinion,
"Request Re: SUBJECT: Mining Loan Fund AS 27.09," File No. 366-317-83,
1982 Alas. AG LEXIS 245\] Note: 'AS' = Alaska Statute

You have requested advice as to whether your department\'s reply to
Anchorage Sand and Gravel Co., Inc.\'s letter concerning its eligibility
for a loan under AS 27.06, the Mining Loan Fund, is correct. Anchorage
Sand and Gravel is engaged in the business of mining gravel in Palmer
and transporting the material to Anchorage by rail. The company proposes
to purchase 80 100-ton capacity triple hopper railroad cars to use in
this operation, and wants a loan from the Mining Loan Fund to finance
this purchase. You responded by letter of October 7, 1982 that Anchorage
Sand and Gravel is not eligible for a loan because the proposed use of
the loan proceeds is inconsistent with the stated purposes of the Mining
Loan fund. We agree that this is a correct interpretation.

As Commissioner Webber noted in his letter to the president of Anchorage
Sand and Gravel, the emphasis of the fund is on mining operations
involving minerals. **[AS]{.underline}** 27.09.010
**[states]{.underline}** that the [[Mining Loan
Fund]{.underline}]{.mark} is set up \"[to underwrite]{.underline}
\[\*2\] advanced mineral **[exploration]{.underline}**,
**[development]{.underline}** or mining **[in the
state]{.underline}**.\" \"[**Development**\" is **defined** as \". . .
the **preparation** of a **proven** mineral **deposit** for
**mining**]{.underline}, \" AS 27.09.060(4). \"[Mining\" is defined as
\". . . the extraction of ore and the preparation of a mineral product
for market]{.underline}.\" AS 27.09.060(6).

Mineral itself is not defined in the statute, however, courts have
consistently held that ordinary sand and gravel are not minerals.
Anchorage Sand and Gravel Co. v. Schubert, 114 F.Supp. 436 (D.C. Ak.
1983); see also Holland v. Dolese Co., 540 P.2d 549 (Okl. 1975), Whittle
v. Wolff, 437 P.2d 114 (Or. 1968).

The fact that Anchorage Sand and Gravel is subject to the Mining License
Tax under AS 43.lk has no bearing on this determination. The definition
of mining found in AS 43.65 is not controlling for AS 27.09 because each
statute has a different purpose. AS 43.65 is a revenue raising measure
while AS 27.09 is a loan program. See Northern Adjusters, Inc. v. Dept.
of Revenue, 627 P.2d 205 (Alaska 1981). 1

For these reasons we agree with your conclusion that Anchorage Sand and
Gravel is not eligible for a loan from the Mining Loan Fund. Please let
us know if we can be of any further assistance in this matter.

[[Ex. Ord]{.underline}]{.mark}. No. 13795. Implementing an America-First
Offshore Energy Strategy

Ex. Ord. No. 13795, Apr. 28, 2017, 82 F.R. 20815, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., and in order to maintain global
leadership in energy innovation, exploration, and production, it is
hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Findings. America must put the energy needs of American
families and businesses first and continue implementing a plan that
ensures energy security and economic vitality for decades to come. The
energy and minerals produced from lands and waters under Federal
management are important to a vibrant economy and to our national
security. Increased domestic energy production on Federal lands and
waters strengthens the Nation\'s security and reduces reliance on
imported energy. Moreover, low energy prices, driven by an increased
American energy supply, will benefit American families and help
reinvigorate American manufacturing and job growth. Finally, because the
Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of energy in the
United States, domestic energy production also improves our Nation\'s
military readiness.

Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to encourage
energy exploration and production, including on the Outer Continental
Shelf, in order to maintain the Nation\'s position as a global energy
leader and foster energy security and resilience for the benefit of the
American people, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and
environmentally responsible.

Sec. 3. Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy. To carry
out the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of
the Interior shall:

\(a\) as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the
procedures set forth in section 1344 of title 43, United States Code, in
consultation with the Secretary of Defense, give full consideration to
revising the schedule of proposed oil and gas lease sales, as described
in that section, so that it includes, but is not limited to, annual
lease sales, to the maximum extent permitted by law, in each of the
following Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas, as designated by the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (Planning Areas): Western Gulf
of Mexico, Central Gulf of Mexico, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Cook
Inlet, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic;

\(b\) ensure that any revisions made pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section do not hinder or affect ongoing lease sales currently scheduled
as part of the 2017--2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing
Proposed Final Program, as published on November 18, 2016; and

\(c\) develop and implement, in coordination with the Secretary of
Commerce and to the maximum extent permitted by law, a streamlined
permitting approach for privately funded seismic data research and
collection aimed at expeditiously determining the offshore energy
resource potential of the United States within the Planning Areas.

Sec. 4. Responsible Planning for Future Offshore Energy Potential. (a)
The Secretary of Commerce shall, unless expressly required otherwise,
refrain from designating or expanding any National Marine Sanctuary
under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.,
unless the sanctuary designation or expansion proposal includes a
timely, full accounting from the Department of the Interior of any
energy or mineral resource potential within the designated
area---including offshore energy from wind, oil, natural gas, methane
hydrates, and any other sources that the Secretary of Commerce deems
appropriate---and the potential impact the proposed designation or
expansion will have on the development of those resources. The Secretary
of the Interior shall provide any such accounting within 60 days of
receiving a notification of intent to propose any such National Marine
Sanctuary designation or expansion from the Secretary of Commerce.

\(b\) The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of
Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Homeland
Security, shall conduct a review of all designations and expansions of
National Marine Sanctuaries, and of all designations and expansions of
Marine National Monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, recently
recodified at sections 320301 to 320303 of title 54, United States Code,
designated or expanded within the 10-year period prior to the date of
this order.

\(i\) The review under this subsection shall include:

\(A\) an analysis of the acreage affected and an analysis of the
budgetary impacts of the costs of managing each National Marine
Sanctuary or Marine National Monument designation or expansion;

\(B\) an analysis of the adequacy of any required Federal, State, and
tribal consultations conducted before the designations or expansions;
and

\(C\) the opportunity costs associated with potential energy and mineral
exploration and production from the Outer Continental Shelf, in addition
to any impacts on production in the adjacent region.

\(ii\) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the
Secretary of the Interior, shall report the results of the review under
this subsection to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,
the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Assistant
to the President for Economic Policy.

\(c\) To further streamline existing regulatory authorities, Executive
Order 13754 of December 9, 2016 (Northern Bering Sea Climate
Resilience), is hereby revoked.

Sec. 5. Modification of the Withdrawal of Areas of the Outer Continental
Shelf from Leasing Disposition. The body text in each of the memoranda
of withdrawal from disposition by leasing of the United States Outer
Continental Shelf issued on December 20, 2016, January 27, 2015, and
July 14, 2008, is modified to read, in its entirety, as follows:

\"Under the authority vested in me as President of the United States,
including section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43
U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition by leasing, for a
time period without specific expiration, those areas of the Outer
Continental Shelf designated as of July 14, 2008, as Marine Sanctuaries
under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 16
U.S.C. 1431--1434, 33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.\"

Nothing in the withdrawal under this section affects any rights under
existing leases in the affected areas.

Sec. 6. Reconsideration of Notice to Lessees and Financial Assurance
Regulatory Review. The Secretary of the Interior shall direct the
Director of BOEM to take all necessary steps consistent with law to
review BOEM\'s Notice to Lessees No. 2016--N01 of September 12, 2016
(Notice to Lessees and Operators of Federal Oil and Gas, and Sulfur
Leases, and Holders of Pipeline Right-of-Way and Right-of-Use and
Easement Grants in the Outer Continental Shelf), and determine whether
modifications are necessary, and if so, to what extent, to ensure
operator compliance with lease terms while minimizing unnecessary
regulatory burdens. The Secretary of the Interior shall also review
BOEM\'s financial assurance regulatory policy to determine the extent to
which additional regulation is necessary.

Sec. 7. Reconsideration of Well Control Rule. The Secretary of the

consistent with law, consider whether the proposed rule, and any related
rules and guidance, should be revised or withdrawn.

Sec. 9. Expedited Consideration of Incidental Harassment Authorizations,
Incidental-Take, and Seismic Survey Permits. The Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, expedite all stages of consideration of Incidental
Take Authorization requests, including Incidental Harassment
Authorizations and Letters of Authorization, and Seismic Survey permit
applications under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331
et seq., and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.

Sec. 10. Review of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) Technical Memorandum NMFS--OPR--55. The Secretary of Commerce
shall review NOAA\'s Technical Memorandum NMFS--OPR--55 of July 2016

### AT: "Top consulting firms"

#### Deloitte's almost as big of a con as T-minerals

Henry **Mance**, 20**23** -- Interview with Mariana Mazzucato, professor
in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College
London (UCL) and founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation
and Public Purpose (IIPP). "Mariana Mazzucato: 'The McKinseys and the
Deloittes have no expertise in the areas that they're advising in'"
Financial Times, 2/12,
<https://www.ft.com/content/fb1254dd-a011-44cc-bde9-a434e5a09fb4> //DH

[The Big Con]{.underline} of the book's title is not a crime; [it's a
confidence trick. Consultancies]{.underline} and outsourcers, Mazzucato
argues, [know less than they claim]{.underline}, [cost more than they
seem to]{.underline}, and --- over the long term --- prevent the public
sector developing in-house capabilities. "We're not against consultants.
The problem is when an industry \[has\] no incentive to get government
to be independent. A therapist who has their client in therapy forever
obviously isn't a very good therapist." Consultants are not "neutral"
about the role of the state, either, Mazzucato argues, citing their
private sector work. They promoted slimming the state after 2008.

On both sides of the Atlantic, advocates of state action like Mazzucato
are in the ascendancy. But she worries that there is still an
unwillingness to invest in the bureaucracy itself. "The state is back,
if you look at the figures." The EU has a €2tn recovery plan. Mazzucato
despairs that, in Italy, even under "a great leader" like Mario Draghi,
the plan for EU funds was guided by McKinsey. The US spent \$5tn in
Covid aid. "It's going to be wasted if we don't know how to govern
that."

Born in Italy, raised in the US, Mazzucato has lived in the UK for 22
years. She is charismatic and media-savvy. Before we meet, I receive an
email instructing me to refer to her as a professor, not an economist. I
assume this is a status game, but she laughs it off as a point of
principle. "I'm proud to be an academic."

Mazzucato's work has pushed back against post-financial crisis
austerity, and the theory that the private sector knows best. "For the
past fifty years, the Chicago school kind of economics, new public
management, public choice theory has in some way reduced our faith in
what government can do." Government was "there at best to fix market
failures".

Her 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State detailed how governments had
historically done much more, seeding technologies, including the
internet and electric cars. Although she places herself on the
centre-left, her ideas have appealed to those on both the left and
right. Mazzucato worked with Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon,
to set up the Scottish National Investment Bank. She missed going to
Davos this year because she was due to fly to Barbados to work with its
premier Mia Mottley, and had to juggle childcare with her husband. She
has four children with Carlo Cresto-Dina, an "artsy-fartsy" film
producer whose latest film, Le Pupille, is nominated for an Oscar.

To highlight the risk of consultants, her current theme, Mazzucato goes
back to the Apollo space programme, where Nasa's director of procurement
in the 1960s warned that the agency was at risk of being "captured by
brochuremanship". In recent times, Covid has been a bonanza for
consultants: the UK was paying Deloitte £1mn a day for its work on
testing and contact tracing.

In 2020 Theodore Agnew, then a UK government minister, complained that
the reliance on consultancies "infantilises the civil service by
depriving our brightest people of opportunities to work on some of the
most challenging, fulfilling and crunchy issues". But his proposed
solution, an in-house government consultancy, has now been abandoned,
because it struggled to match the range of external consultants.
Mazzucato describes that as "a tragic" step, suggesting that Whitehall
departments aren't committed to reducing their spending on consultants.

The difficulty in criticising consultants, I suggest, is that the
evidence is elusive. Consultants' work is often opaque, and feeds into
broader processes. French parliamentarians criticised McKinsey for its
role in the country's sluggish vaccine rollout. But how do we know that
things wouldn't have been even worse without the firm? "[These are
private companies, the McKinseys and the Deloittes, that have **no
expertise** in the areas that they're advising in."]{.underline}

Worst of all, when you combine the offense/defense limits paradigm with
\"what you do is what you justify\", the negative is a walking
contradiction that affirmatives never notice. [Prioritizing
limits]{.underline} over all other goals of topicality [justifies
arbitrary interpretations]{.underline}. For example, if the negative can
interpret a word in a nonsensical way to set a fair limit on the topic,
why can\'t the affirmatively similarly counter-interpret the topic to
where only their affirmative is topical? [Both sides lose in this
equation because debate must be built on predictable ground: the topic
is generated by a general consensus of what words mean, and affirmatives
and negatives prepare accordingly]{.underline}. [Predictability
is]{.underline} almost always [more important than limits]{.underline}
in that respect [because topicality is about evenly dividing ground for
both sides. Allowing debaters to upset the parity that predictable
interpretations generate has **no stopping point**]{.underline}. [The
end result is that debaters will **mangle the resolution**]{.underline}
in order **[to gain a competitive advantage]{.underline}**.
