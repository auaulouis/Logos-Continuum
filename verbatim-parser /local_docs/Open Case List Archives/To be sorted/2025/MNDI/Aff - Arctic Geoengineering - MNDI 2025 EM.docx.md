We all like sunny holidays at the beach and rain is good for the garden.
Cold weather kills insect pests and wildfires germinate seeds in ancient
forests. My British colleagues like to complain, but the seasons bring
us pleasure. Our relentless use of fossil fuels is changing all that --
we're experiencing extremes of heat, droughts, and wildfires, as well as
extreme rain and floods. For us in the UK, many of the worst impacts of
climate change are perhaps a century away. But places like [[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} are suffering right now and [[could
face]{.mark} [catastrophic changes]{.mark} [within]{.mark} the next few
[decades]{.mark}. [Emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[reductions]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark} needed to protect
it, but it's [[taking a long time]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yes, good things
come to those who wait -- but the Arctic isn't waiting. [[The Arctic is
warming three]{.mark} and a half [times faster]{.mark} than]{.underline}
[anywhere else]{.underline} in the world. The World Meteorological
Organization reported just a few weeks ago that, over the next five
years, winter Arctic temperatures are expected to be 2.4°C above the
average of the last 30 years. [Arctic [sea ice]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
a result, [[is melting at alarming rates]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
concerning for a number of reasons. It is, of course, a home -- many
people and ecosystems depend upon it. But it also helps stabilise the
global climate; the bright white ice reflects sunlight and keeps
temperatures down. [[When the ice melts]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} bright ice is replaced by [dark
[ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[absorbs
sunlight]{.underline}]{.mark}, warms the water, and hinders new ice from
forming in the winter. **[[It's a doom loop]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
warming melts ice, melted ice exacerbates warming -- [with global
consequences]{.underline}. Changing this trajectory is urgent. [The
Arctic is racing]{.underline} ever faster [towards]{.underline}
dangerous, [irreversible changes]{.underline}, and we're just toddling
behind. Ten years ago, we held a conference in Cambridge focused on
"Solar Radiation Management" (SRM). At that time, it was just a backup
plan, but we knew the Arctic was in danger from human-caused climate
change and that progress on reducing emissions was frustratingly slow.
On the final day, protestors swarmed in, telling us our work was a
distraction from the real need to get off fossil fuels. A few months
later, we and the protestors were both made happy: COP21 established the
Paris Agreement, in which countries promised to do something about their
emissions. (Bear in mind, this was 2015 -- twenty years since we had
started this process -- but at least it was something.) A decade later,
however, [[Arctic sea ice]{.underline}]{.mark} extent [[is at its
lowest]{.mark} on record [and we're burning more fossil fuels than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and not because SRM distracted anyone. What
have we got so badly wrong? Perhaps we have been too quick to put our
trust in technologies that don't exist yet: those nuclear power stations
that will be ready by next century, that carbon capture and storage
system that exists at a prototype scale and that is barely funded. We've
assumed we can carry on as we are with those in place. At the same time,
we have been too slow to realise the urgency of the situation, and how
[[emissions reductions]{.mark},]{.underline} though essential, [[might
not be sufficient alone]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have tiptoed around the
idea of additional measures, including SRM, that could buy us more time.
People are still telling us to wait, not get distracted, it's too risky.

#### Arctic amplification is a driver of global warming -- positive feedback loops will push us past the 2-degree threshold and make catastrophic climate change inevitable

Leslie **Field**, 3/9/**21**, Arctic Circle, \[Ph.D., Founder and CTO
Arctic Ice Project and Stanford Adjunct Lecturer\], "Restoring Arctic
Ice: A New Way to Stabilize the Climate,"
https://www.arcticcircle.org/journal/restoring-arctic-ice-a-new-way-to-stabilize-the-climate,
mm

The Arctic holds incredible beauty and difficult challenges.
Historically it has played a vital role in maintaining stability for the
Earth's climate systems -- even those far-removed from the Arctic
itself. Ice in the Arctic is of central importance to the world, and is
a dominant feature in the environment of its indigenous peoples, and
their cultures and way of life; as well as the Arctic's beautiful and
unique environment, ecosystem, and resident non-human species. In recent
decades, [the Arctic has warmed]{.underline} two to [three]{.underline}
[times as fast as the rest of the planet]{.underline} -- a phenomenon
called Arctic Amplification. As the Arctic has warmed, [[95% of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} thickest, oldest, [[most
reflective]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic [[ice has
melted]{.underline}]{.mark}, at an increasing pace in a positive
feedback loop. Ice still grows in the Arctic winter, but the summer ice
melt is destroying most of the thick, highly reflective multiyear ice.
The new ice is thin, and much less reflective, which allows most of the
incoming summer sunlight to be absorbed by the ocean further warming it,
and leading to further melting. Many scientists believe that [[this
positive feedback]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [led to Arctic
warming]{.mark}]{.underline} [[becoming]{.underline}]{.mark} not only a
consequence, but also **[[a driver of climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and responsible for a significant
fraction of global warming.]{.underline} Below is an analysis of
satellite data by NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center
(NSIDC). It shows that the 2020 minimum extent measured 3.74 million
square kilometers. That is 2.48 square kilometers below the 1981-2010
average of yearly minimum extents, and 2020 is only the second time on
record that the minimum extent has fallen below 4 million square
kilometers. [Arctic warming]{.underline} and ice loss is an urgent
problem that [will affect every living being on Earth]{.underline}. [If
we do not take effective action]{.underline} on this front within a very
short time, the oceans will continue to warm and [[the Arctic will
experience summers with no sea ice]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly [[by
2030]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition, [Greenland's melt
will]{.underline} continue to [accelerate]{.underline}, [raising sea
levels]{.underline} worldwide [so that]{.underline} millions or even
**[[billions will become refugees]{.mark};]{.underline}** [coastal
infrastructures will be]{.underline} damaged and
[destroyed]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} more and more [[species will
be driven to extinction]{.mark}. [The pace of Arctic
warming]{.mark}]{.underline} and ice melt [[make it unlikely that we
can]{.mark} fulfill the Paris Accords]{.underline} goal [to
[limit]{.mark} [temperature]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[rise]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} no more than
1.5-[[2 degrees]{.underline}]{.mark} Celsius by 2100, and it is unlikely
that humanity can meet all, or perhaps any, of the United Nations'
Sustainable Development Goals. To meet the Paris Accord's goal, the
world will not only need to dramatically cut its greenhouse gases (GHG)
emissions but also develop and employ ways to sequester GHGs from the
atmosphere. [**[None of the technology required]{.mark} to
[accomplish]{.mark} this [mitigation and sequestration]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} sufficiently [mature]{.mark} to accomplish these tasks.**
[There is also the threat]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [loss of Arctic sea ice
is moving toward a tipping point]{.mark} that may lead to the emission
of a tremendous amount of methane]{.underline} (with 20 times the
warming potential of CO2) from tundra, shallow ice shelves, and the
ocean floor [that can cause catastrophic changes across the
globe.]{.underline} Already Arctic warming is threatening much of its
infrastructure. About 70% of the Arctic infrastructure is built on
permafrost which is melting. In Alaska alone two indigenous communities
were forced to relocate because of sea level rise, erosion, and melting
permafrost; and another 12 communities are in danger. A further example
of the impact of Arctic warming is the recent oil spill in Norilsk,
Russia which sent 150,000 barrels of oil toward the Arctic Ocean because
of weakened infrastructure due to melting permafrost. Continued Arctic
warming could lead to similar events in the future. The Arctic has been
acknowledged as "ground zero" of climate change. The changes seen in the
Arctic are already felt worldwide. Loss of Arctic ice is contributing to
changing weather patterns globally and in the Northern Hemisphere in
particular. [[Extreme weather events]{.underline}]{.mark} such as heavy
rain and flooding in mid-Atlantic states and droughts and wildfires in
the western states [[have been linked to Arctic
Amplification]{.mark}.]{.underline} Japan, Scandinavia, and much of
Europe had persistent heat waves. These heat waves have led to wildfires
in Greece. Evaluating only the cost of climate-related disasters, it is
estimated that in just a recent two- year period, 2016 through 2018,
such disasters cost the world \$650 billion. [[Cost
estimates]{.underline}]{.mark} [for climate change-related
disasters]{.underline} and associated infrastructure, agricultural,
economic and human health impacts by 2040 are staggering.
[[In]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[the next two
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, these costs [[are estimated to be \$54
trillion world-wide]{.underline}.]{.mark} While this accelerating ice
melt threatens our future, short-term economic considerations are
leading some to relish the thought of increased access to Arctic
resources such as minerals, oil and gas; as well as additional shipping
routes and military deployment options. Given the threats that warming
due to fossil fuel emissions pose, the world needs to ask if it is wise
to continue to extract oil from new sources in the Arctic when we need
to accelerate our energy structure away from fossil fuels and towards
more sustainable energy sources. [Rather than accept Arctic ice loss as
a lost cause]{.underline} and suffer the tragic consequences outlined
above, [[it is time]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} thoroughly evaluate and work to urgently
[[implement]{.underline}]{.mark}, the most beneficial, safe, practical,
and effective [[solutions to restore Arctic ice]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### CO~2~ buildup means warming is locked-in -- only geoengineering can avoid the worst impacts of climate change and buy time for mitigation technologies to catch-up

Elil **Hoole** **and** Shaun **Fitzgerald**, 4/5/**22**, \[Hoole is a
Research Associate, Centre for Climate Repair, University of Cambridge;
Fitzgerald is a Teaching Fellow in Engineering, University of
Cambridge\], The Conversation, "Any plans to dim the Sun and cool the
Earth must be led by those most affected by climate change,"

mm

Somewhere between 15% and [[40% of CO₂]{.mark} emissions [will remain in
the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since so
[[much climate change is]{.mark} already ["locked in]{.mark}", [any
strategy]{.mark} to tackle it [based on emissions]{.mark} reduction
[alone]{.mark}]{.underline}, regardless of how quickly we reduce them,
[[would]{.mark} still [result]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [catastrophic ice
losses in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and Antarctica [leading to sea
level rise, loss of low-lying countries and hundreds of millions of
climate refugees]{.underline}. [[It would still mean]{.mark} [global
food and water shortages, massive flooding]{.mark} and wild fires,
[and]{.mark} a permanent [loss of ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
devastating changes will continue to disproportionately impact the
global south. We believe [[the best way to avert]{.mark} major
[disaster]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is to develop and deploy]{.mark}
temporary schemes which can partially shield some of the Earth from
incoming solar radiation]{.underline}, at least until emissions
reductions and carbon capture and storage can be scaled up. There are
two main approaches which have very different characteristics. The first
involves releasing small reflective particles into the upper atmosphere,
which would reflect sunlight back into space. Known as "stratospheric
aerosol injection", this process would cool the globe for several years
or more, but it is controversial because of the potential for global and
long-lasting unintended consequences. The other approach, "[[marine
cloud brightening]{.mark}", involves ships generating sea
spray]{.underline}. [The water droplets evaporate and the resulting salt
crystals get carried up into the air. [This]{.mark} gives clouds
something to form around, and [helps cool the planet since the
clouds]{.mark} formed by small salt crystals [reflect]{.mark} more of
[the Sun's energy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As these particles are returned
to the ocean in a matter of weeks, [it is]{.mark} much [easier to "turn
off" cloud brightening if]{.mark} ever it was deemed
[necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Together with its potential to be
deployed on a more regional basis, [this]{.mark} [makes]{.mark}
[it]{.mark} more [likely to be acceptable]{.mark} to the public and
policymakers]{.underline}. [Most of what [we understand]{.mark} about
[these technologies]{.mark} come [from]{.mark} computer simulations
known as [climate models]{.mark}. [There]{.mark} [have]{.mark}
[been]{.mark} some [real-world experiments]{.mark}]{.underline},
however. For instance China has injected particles in the atmosphere to
try and seed new clouds and encourage precipitation in remote mountains,
and has covered a glacier with cloth to prevent it melting. In Peru,
authorities once painted a mountain white in order to reflect more heat
and protect its glacier (darker colours are more absorbent). There are
plans to protect Australia's Great Barrier Reef with cloud brightening.
These initial steps give us valuable insights into the possibilities and
limitations of these technologies. But further funding and research is
needed to understand the limitations and risks. There are technical
questions to be addressed, but there are also critical social science
issues -- research will need to examine the contexts in which these
kinds of technology develop, with a focus on dimensions of gender,
ethics, justice, equity and sustainable development among communities
most affected by climate change. Research collaborations and governance
mechanisms must evolve to provide space for leadership from these
communities, which will in turn strengthen global capacities to develop
and deploy safe, inclusive technologies as an intermediate solution to
climate change. The cost of climate injustice cannot be easily
quantified. However, communities least able to adapt, perhaps due to a
lack of resources, pre-existing conflicts, or because they're based in
an area already prone to droughts or hurricanes, may well argue that no
amount of climate change is safe. [Technological advancements such as
[marine cloud brightening]{.mark} mean there is a potential pathway to
avert catastrophe]{.underline} and this needs to be further developed.
If we place human life and global environmental security at the heart of
our response, [we must explore potential technologies that
[could]{.mark} save countless lives and [stave off the worst impacts of
climate change until mitigation policies catch up]{.mark} with
reality.]{.underline} But crucially, decisions on how the research is
undertaken and whether interventions should be deployed have to be led
by (not just involve) those who will otherwise be most affected by
climate change.

#### We are on the brink of losing the cryosphere -- immediate deployment of solar geoengineering is key to avoiding irreversible tipping points -- every fraction of a degree matters

Viktor **Jaakola**, 11/26/**24**, SRM360, \[Viktor is the Head of
Scientific Collaboration at Operaatio Arktis, a Finnish youth-led
climate strategy agency. The mission of Operaatio Arktis entails
rigorous research and serious inclusive deliberation on SRM\], "With
Arctic Tipping Points So Close, We Cannot Ignore SRM,"
https://srm360.org/perspective/arctic-tipping-points-we-cannot-ignore-srm/,

If you have been keeping a close eye on climate data, you will have
noticed that over the past 12 months [[the average global temperature
has been]{.mark} about [1.66°C]{.mark} higher than the
baseline]{.underline} of 1850--1900. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} the
International Cryosphere and Climate Initiative states that
"[[1.5°C]{.underline} [is the only option" for the
cryospher]{.underline}]{.mark}[e]{.underline} -- the parts of the earth
where water is frozen solid. The OECD's 2022 tipping point report agrees
that warming must be kept to no more than 1.5°C. [We are]{.underline}
now [at a temperature where [the melting of the Arctic permafrost is a
real threat: a]{.mark} dangerous [tipping point which could lead to
**irreversible changes**]{.mark} in the climate system]{.underline}.
This change in circumstances happened very quickly, in just a few years.
The global mean temperature has shot up from 1.2°C to 1.6°C, whilst the
best estimates for temperature thresholds of a number of tipping points
have been lowered. If 1.5°C truly is the only option for the cryosphere;
if **[[every tenth of a degree matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**; if we
want to avoid the disappearance of Arctic summer sea ice and the
crossing of multiple tipping points, then SRM \[[[sunlight
reflection]{.underline}]{.mark} methods\] research is of utmost
importance. SRM is [the only known approach that [could be used to cool
the planet]{.mark} within a few years]{.underline}. This doesn't mean
SRM is realistic, a good idea, or anything else of the sort. It does
mean that [its]{.underline} successful [near-future
deployment]{.underline} together with rapid mitigation [might be the
only way to avoid]{.underline} these [dangerous tipping
points.]{.underline} If you hypothetically had to choose between
deploying SRM before key tipping points have been crossed, or after,
then you would want to deploy before, in order to avoid drastic
planetary changes. [[Acting early would preserve]{.mark} more
[familiar]{.mark} ecological and [climatic
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Waiting until after these tipping
points have happened means doing damage control on a planet that has an
increasingly alien climate]{.underline}. Right now, **[[we are standing
on the threshold]{.underline}]{.mark}** between these options. [[If we
wait for too long, SRM won't be as valuable]{.underline}]{.mark}, [since
we will have]{.underline} exceeded important tipping points and [lost
ecosystems]{.underline} and people [that could]{.underline} perhaps
[have been safeguarded]{.underline} by an earlier deployment.

#### Cryosphere collapse shuts down the AMOC and destroys global ocean circulation systems -- the Arctic is ground zero

Irene **Quaile**, 10/28/**24**, (Irene Quaile has been writing about the
Arctic since 2007), Arctic Today, "Ground zero: Why the warming Arctic
must top the global agenda,"

As we head into COP29 in oil-and-gas-rich Azerbaijan with the UN warning
we are on course for up to 3°C of temperature rise, [climate scientists
are urging governments to focus on cryosphere]{.underline}. [[The frozen
regions]{.mark} of our planet [are warming]{.mark} several times
[faster]{.mark} [than the]{.mark} global [average]{.mark}]{.underline}.
If the nations of the world cannot agree on measures to hold global
warming to a maximum of 1.5°C, the [experts]{.underline}
[warn]{.underline} [of]{.underline} potentially [devastating and
irreversible impacts from cryosphere melt]{.underline}, not just for the
icy north, but for the whole planet. [Icy temperatures making northern
Europe uninhabitable, a breakdown of agriculture, fisheries disruption,
unprecedented regional weather extremes, additional sea level rise with
disastrous flooding]{.underline} -- the Nordic Council of Ministers
meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October received a stark warning from
43 leading international climate scientists. In an open letter delivered
by Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, Head of Earth System Analysis at
Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the experts
warn that there is a "serious risk of a major ocean circulation change
in the Atlantic, (...) with devastating and irreversible impacts,
especially for Nordic countries, but also for other parts of the world".
The [[experts see]{.mark} growing [evidence that
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
([[AMOC]{.underline}]{.mark}), the system of ocean currents that
transports heat northwards into the North Atlantic,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[at]{.mark} [risk of]{.mark}
passing [a tipping point]{.mark} and eventually
[collapsing]{.mark}]{.underline}. AMOC, the scientists write,
"determines life conditions for all people in the Arctic region and
beyond". [Remember]{.underline} that Hollywood film, "[The Day after
Tomorrow]{.underline}", [with the scenario of melting polar ice caps
pouring fresh water into the oceans and diluting the salt level
balance]{.underline}, causing the temperature of the ocean currents to
plummet and [disrupting the North Atlantic current]{.underline}? A
Hollywood blockbuster: doom, rapid and sudden disaster, heroics, emotion
and plenty of willing suspension of disbelief. But that basic idea of
polar ice changing currents, warmth transport and disrupting the
climate? Not as far-fetched as it might have seemed? [[An influx of
cold, fresh water]{.mark}]{.underline} from melting land ice like
Greenland's massive ice sheet, [[is]{.mark} a major factor in [changing
ocean currents]{.mark}]{.underline}, altering the temperature and
salinity of the water. [There are indications that AMOC has been
slowing]{.underline} down for the last 60 or 70 years due to global
heating, Rahmstorf explains in an interview with the Guardian. The most
ominous sign, he says, is the "cold blob" over the northern Atlantic.
"The region is the only place in the world that has cooled in the past
20 years or so, while everywhere else on the planet has warmed -- a sign
of reduced heat transport into that region, exactly what climate
computer models have predicted in response to Amoc slowing as a result
of greenhouse gas emissions." So why the outcry at this particular time?
"[[A string of scientific studies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the past few
years [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[this risk
has]{.underline}]{.mark} so far **[[been]{.mark} [greatly
underestimated]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the climate scientists write in
their open letter. "Such an ocean circulation change would have
devastating and irreversible impacts especially for Nordic countries,
but also for other parts of the world." The authors, from institutes all
over the globe, say ["science increasingly confirms that [the
Arctic]{.mark} region [is]{.mark} a **"[ground zero]{.mark}"** for
tipping point risks and climate regulation across the
planet]{.underline}." They warn: "In this region, the Greenland Ice
Sheet, the Barents sea ice, the boreal permafrost systems, the subpolar
gyre deep-water formation and AMOC are all vulnerable to major,
interconnected nonlinear changes". The reports by the IPCC, the
syntheses of our scientific knowledge on climate change, which should
provide the basis for governments to act on climate, are unable to keep
pace with ongoing research. The body allocates degrees of likelihood to
possible changes in the climate system. The IPCC concluded in its last
report that "there is medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation will not collapse abruptly before 2100". Now
that might have reassured a lot of people, especially looking at a
short-term perspective. "But if it were to occur, it would very likely
cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on
ecosystems and human activities", the report went on. Now the 43 authors
of the open letter, including high-profile scientists like Timothy
Lenton, Anders Levermann, Michael Mann, Stefan Rahmstorf and Johan
Rockström say recent research since [the]{.underline} last
[IPCC]{.underline} report suggests the body [has underestimated this
risk]{.underline}, [and that "the [passing]{.mark} of [this]{.mark}
[tipping point is a]{.mark} serious [possibility]{.mark} already **[in
the next few decades]{.mark}**"]{.underline}. Worrying? The scientists
stress that despite significant research into the possibility and
mechanisms of a collapse, the probability of such an occurrence remains
highly uncertain. But in their view, only "[medium confidence"
in]{.underline} the [AMOC not collapsing "is not reassuring, and clearly
leaves open the possibility of an AMOC collapse during this
century.]{.underline} And there is even greater likelihood that a
collapse is triggered this century but only fully plays out in the
next", they write. It is a question of risk assessment, Rahmstorf told
the Guardian: " [I compare it to being told that there is a 10% chance
of an airplane crashing]{.underline}. [Would you get on that
plane?]{.underline} I wouldn't. [The]{.underline} disastrous
[consequences are unacceptable]{.underline}." As for his own
expectations: "I am now very concerned that [we may push AMOC over this
tipping point in the next decades]{.underline}. If you ask me my gut
feeling, I would say [the risk that we cross the tipping point this
century is about 50/50]{.underline}", Rahmstorf told the Guardian. That
is seriously worrying! A study just published in Nature by the iC3 Polar
Research Hub based at UiT, the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsö,
backs up the warning that [[melting Arctic sea ice could affect global
ocean circulation]{.underline}]{.mark} by looking at what happened in
Earth's history. The researchers discovered that growing inflows of
freshwater from melting Arctic sea-ice into the Nordic Seas "likely
significantly affected ocean circulation, sending temperatures
plummeting across northern Europe." Lead author Mohamed Ezat from the
iC3 Polar Research Hub, told me in an email: "While climate models
provide valuable insights into what our future climate may look like,
they still carry large uncertainties, in particular for long-term
predictions and at regional scales. Looking at the distant past of the
earth's climate history in particular when it was warmer than today can
reduce such uncertainties. For example, in our study we focused on the
Last Interglacial period, some 128,000 years ago, when the global
average temperature was estimated to be 1 to 2 C warmer than
preindustrial i.e.it is like what we are heading to during this
century." Ezat describes these findings as "alarming": "This reminds us
that [[the]{.mark} planet's [climate]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a delicate
balance, easily [disrupted by changes in temperature and ice
cover]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Ice-free summer conditions are expected to
occur in the Arctic Ocean]{.underline} from [as early as]{.underline}
the year [2050]{.underline}. As I have discussed so many times on the
Ice Blog, what happens in the High North affects the whole planet. As
Ezat told me, based on his research: "[Changes in Arctic Sea ice can
significantly impact the ocean ecosystems]{.underline} and resources at
high latitudes. [It also affects the climate globally]{.underline}. For
example, and of particular relevance to our study, [melting of Arctic
sea ice may result in enhanced freshwater export into the]{.underline}
Nordic Seas and the [North Atlantic Ocean]{.underline}. [This may slow
down the]{.underline} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
\[[AMOC]{.underline}\], which can ultimately lead to disruptions of the
seasonal monsoons, reduced oceanic carbon dioxide uptake (and thus more
CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere) and additional sea-level rise in
some regions such as along the U.S. East coast." This fits with the
warnings issued by the 43 scientists to the Nordic Council of Ministers.
"The impacts particularly on Nordic Countries would likely be
catastrophic, including major cooling in the region while surrounding
regions warm. This would be an enlargement and deepening of the 'cold
blob' that already has developed over the subpolar Atlantic Ocean, and
likely lead to unprecedented extreme weather. While the impacts on
weather patterns, ecosystems and human activities warrant further study,
they would potentially threaten the viability of agriculture in
northwestern Europe", the scientists explain. [Scientists]{.underline}
and concerned groups [have]{.underline} long [been highlighting the
importance of cryosphere melt]{.underline} and trying to direct
attention towards the impacts at the annual UN climate talks. The
International Cryosphere Climate (ICCI) Initiative, which publishes the
annual State of the Cryosphere Report, regularly organizes a Cryosphere
Pavilionat the COP venue, bringing scientists, negotiators and
policymakers together to put the spotlight on our frozen regions. Last
year, the organisation published an open letter at COP28 by more than
1,000 scientists, calling for the Cover Decision to include the
cryosphere issue: "[[Because of the Cryosphere response, even 2°C is too
high]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Paris Agreement's "well below 2°C" can
mean just one thing: 1.5°C alone. We therefore need a Stocktake with
clear guidelines to make 1.5°C a reality; a path to phase out fossil
fuels; and financial mechanisms to support climate action, as well as
the adaptation, and loss and damage -- most of it ultimately tied to
irreversible Cryosphere loss -- now inevitable even below 1.5°C; but far
worse above that. A failure to do so would mean "world leaders are de
facto deciding to burden humanity for centuries to millennia by
displacing hundreds of millions of people from flooding coastal
settlements; depriving societies of life-giving freshwater resources,
disrupting delicately-balanced polar ocean and mountain ecosystems; and
forcing future generations to offset long-term permafrost emissions."
Sadly, the Dubai COP28 did not produce the desired results: [[With each
passing year]{.underline}]{.mark}, the need for climate action becomes
more urgent, [[the window for averting catastrophic impacts closes
further]{.underline}]{.mark}. At COP29 in Baku, we still have another
chance. ICCI will publish the 2024 State of the Cryosphere Report,in the
coming weeks. It is unlikely to bring any respite, I fear. The
organisation is also one of 8 partners joining Norway, the current Chair
of the Arctic Council, to host a major side event at COP29 entitled "A
message from the Frozen World -- the Global Impact of a Changing
Cryosphere". Politicians, scientists and Indigenous representatives will
aim to "bring the cryosphere to COP29", as part of a concerted effort to
bridge the gap between science on the one hand and policy and governance
on the other. "For too long, the cryosphere has been left off the global
climate agenda despite its immense impacts. As Chair of the Arctic
Council, Norway is determined to bring this critical issue to the
forefront, convening key actors and driving action. Norway is committed
to elevating the cryosphere on the global agenda, ensuring the world
hears the urgent message from the polar and high mountains region and
takes decisive action," the Arctic Council writes. Sounds good? High
time, given Norway's location in the High North -- and the country's
background as a fossil-fuel economy. Glaciers and ice sheets, snow,
permafrost and sea ice all bind us together by supplying fresh water to
millions of people, stabilizing the global climate, and protecting us
from sea-level rise, the organizers write."However, the cryosphere is
under significant threat from various climate change-driven factors, and
the world cannot look away". They make the link between the Arctic and
other cryosphere regions such as the Himalayas, and other parts of the
world which will be affected by change in distant frozen regions. "These
changes are speeding up at an unprecedented rate and impacting people
everywhere. (...) Sea-level rise from ice sheets and glaciers is
flooding low-lying coastal areas and causing erosion, putting hundreds
of millions of people in coastal cities and island communities at risk
in coming decades. Mountain glaciers, which provide freshwater to
millions of people, are melting rapidly, and snowpack is decreasing.
This is leading to increased flooding and contamination of water
sources, which threatens the supply of reliable freshwater to billions
of people. Thawing permafrost is causing severe damage to buildings and
infrastructure across the Arctic, Himalayas and other mountain regions.
The changing cryosphere is also threatening homes and livelihoods, often
impacting Indigenous Peoples such as the Saami, Inuit and Sherpa who
also face a multitude of external compounding threats. It is also
opening travel to and through the Arctic, leading to increased activity
in areas such as shipping and mining exploration." The side event, with
high-ranking politicians, scientists and Indigenous representatives,
"not only integrates comprehensive insights from local to global scales
but also transitions smoothly into actionable steps guided by the latest
scientific research and policy frameworks, aiming to catalyze decisive
global actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and short-lived
climate forcers to limit global warming to 1.5°C. " That, I would say,
is official-speak for finally getting the message across to the world's
governments that they need to increase their efforts massively and come
up with definitive measures to hold global warming to 1.5°C. In its 2023
Synthesis Report, the IPCC expresses "high confidence that the
likelihood of irreversible changes in the climate system will increase
with the level of global warming". It also explains that the likelihood
of potentially massive negative impacts increases with the level of
warming. Given that this is a body whose reports are subject to a
rigorous editing process including pressure from governments to avoid
anything that could be construed as panic-making or force them to take
rapid measures they don't want to take, that is a pretty strong
statement. As the scientists point out to the Nordic ministers, the IPCC
actually writes that "risks associated with large-scale singular events
or tipping points... transition to high risk between 1.5°C -- 2.5°C of
global warming". How much more do we need? Why has this not set the
alarm bells ringing? The world's experts have been telling us that even
within the Paris Agreement limits of 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, we are
risking catastrophic impacts across the globe, and that the risk gets
higher with every bit of warming. The United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) has just published its Emissions Gap Report 2024 (sub-titled: No
more hot air ... please!). You could be forgiven if you missed it, as it
was pushed onto the media sidelines by ongoing crises in the Middle East
and Ukraine and the US election (whose outcome admittedly will to a
large extent determine the fate of our climate). The report identifies a
"massive gap between rhetoric and reality" as countries draft their new
climate commitments, to be presented early in 2025, while climate
impacts intensify around the globe. "Nations must deliver dramatically
stronger ambition and action in the next round of Nationally Determined
Contributions or the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal will be gone within a
few years", the UN finds. Continuation of current policies will lead to
a catastrophic temperature rise of up to 3.1°C, the report concludes.
Talk about scary? Current commitments for 2030 are not being met; even
if they are met, temperature rise would only be limited to 2.6-2.8°C.
Nations must collectively commit to cutting 42 per cent off annual
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 57 percent by 2025 in the next
round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) -- and back this up
with rapid action. Otherwise, the world on course for a temperature
increase of 2.6-3.1°C over the course of this century. This would bring
"debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies", UNEP states.
That could be putting it mildly. Trying to look on the positive side,
"It is still technically possible to meet the 1.5°C goal, but only with
a G20-led massive global mobilization to cut all greenhouse gas
emissions, starting today", the report finds. What is happening in the
cryosphere should convince even the most reluctant of the need to reduce
emissions drastically asap. Let us come back to the plea for action
presented by those 43 climate scientists to the Nordic Council of
Ministers. That group includes Arctic Council Chair Norway --
self-declared champion of the cryosphere at COP29 -- and Iceland, a
co-organiser of the COP29 cryosphere event and co-chair of the Ambition
on Melting Ice (AMI) group founded by 20 government ministers in 2022 at
COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. (Norway is also a member). AMI aims to
"ensure that the irreversible and devastating global impacts of
cryosphere loss are understood by political leaders and the public
alike: not only within mountain and polar regions, but throughout the
planet." The scientists' message to the political leaders: "[Given the
increasing evidence for a higher risk of an AMOC collapse]{.underline},
we believe [it is of critical importance that Arctic tipping point
risks]{.underline}, in particular the AMOC risk, [are taken
seriously]{.underline} in governance and policy[. Even with a medium
likelihood of occurrence]{.underline}, given that the outcome would be
catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, we
believe [more needs to be done to minimize this risk]{.underline}". And
they stress that the northern governments could champion the cause.

#### AMOC collapse causes extinction -- it triggers global climate disruptions, famine, mass migrations and war -- we are on pace for shutdown by mid-century

David **Garczynski**, 4/3/**24**, \[Garczynski is a writer whose work
has appeared in The New Yorker, Orion, and elsewhere. He is working on a
book about the ocean and the nature of abrupt climate change\], Nautilus
(Science Magazine), "The Ocean Apocalypse is Upon Us, Maybe,"
https://nautil.us/the-ocean-apocalypse-is-upon-us-maybe-542800/, mm

From our small, terrestrial vantage points, we sometimes struggle to
imagine the ocean's impact on our lives. We often think of the ocean as
a flat expanse of blue, with currents as orderly, if sinuous, lines. In
reality, it is vaster and more chaotic than we can imagine. Its waters
move in ways that lack a terrestrial equivalent and, in doing so, the
ocean shirks tidy metaphor. Right now, [in the Atlantic
Ocean]{.underline} alone, a single current, [[the Gulf Stream, is
moving]{.mark} more water than all the world's rivers
combined.]{.underline} Across the ocean's face, invisible to the naked
eye, hundreds of eddies are whirling. Most of them are larger than the
state of Rhode Island and reach more than three miles into the deep. The
ocean's power reaches far onto land. [Its movements transport [vast
amounts]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} salt, nutrients,
oxygen, CO2, and [[heat across the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[In the
absence of ocean currents, large portions of Earth **would be
uninhabitable**]{.underline}]{.mark} [due to buildups of extreme heat
and cold around equatorial regions and poles]{.underline}, respectively.
[[The ocean is the **engine that powers**]{.mark} so much of [our
climate]{.mark}]{.underline} and, by extension, the throttle and
governor that regulates it. Above all, the ocean sets the stage upon
which we conduct our lives. Change a current and you can change how heat
travels around the planet. You can change temperature, change rainfall,
change everything that makes a place habitable to you and me. But in an
era when humanity's actions test and destabilize Earth's delicate
balances, many [oceanographers]{.underline} [believe that [we are headed
toward a great oceanic shift]{.mark}]{.underline}, one
[that]{.underline} [could]{.underline} abruptly---and
[devastatingly]{.underline}---[alter climate patterns
worldwide]{.underline}. You don't have to travel back far in Earth's
history to find a moment when the ocean upended the global climate.
[[About 13,000 years ago]{.mark}, [as the]{.mark} planet warmed and the
[ice sheets]{.mark}]{.underline} that covered it [[began]{.underline}
[retreating, a]{.underline}]{.mark} mysterious and [[abrupt cooling
occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Most of the changes centered around the
North Atlantic]{.underline}. A graph of climate conditions in Europe,
Greenland, and eastern North America during this time shows the
temperature line drop as if in a great swan dive[. [The
decline]{.underline}]{.mark} did not take centuries or millennia; [it
[took place over the course of a few decades]{.underline}]{.mark}. Newly
thawed regions returned to a near-glacial climate. In some places
glaciers grew, forests died back, and dry conditions set in on
once-verdant land. Average temperatures around the North Atlantic
dropped by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit. In Greenland, the temperature
dropped by 18 degrees Fahrenheit---a change, as far as average
temperatures go, like turning parts of New York state into central
Alaska. [[The effects]{.mark} of this event [were not
isolated]{.mark}]{.underline} to the North Atlantic. [Paleo-climate
records show a shift in monsoon patterns across the tropics, as well as
altered climate patterns in China, South America, Africa, and the
western United States.]{.underline} Some archaeologists even note a
shift in human lifestyles, marking a return from settled to more nomadic
living. [[More than a millennium would pass before temperatures]{.mark}
abruptly [returned]{.mark} [to their]{.mark} previous
[highs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This period of Earth's
history]{.underline} is called the Younger Dryas, named for a cold-hardy
flower that flourished in Europe at the time. It [is considered the last
great cold period in the transition from the Ice Age to the current
geologic epoch]{.underline}, the Holocene. While there is some debate
around what caused this drastic climactic shift, [many [scientists
believe the culprit was the collapse of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
([[AMOC]{.underline}]{.mark}): a web of currents responsible for
circulating warm water northward at the Atlantic Ocean's surface and
cold water southward in its depths. While the [AMOC]{.underline} might
sound esoteric, it [is one of the most important systems in Earth's
climate]{.underline}. In the ocean, water is far from uniform. Water in
the tropics, due to evaporation and rainfall patterns, is saltier than
water near the poles. As tropical water flows northward in the Atlantic,
pushed by wind and pulled by differences in ocean density, it loses its
heat in high latitudes. As a result, the water is no longer just salty,
but cold and dense as well. So dense, in fact, that it begins to sink
and penetrate the ocean's deepest layers. Once there, the water begins a
long journey south, joining a great, globe-spanning loop connecting
every region of the ocean. This loop is called the global thermohaline
circulation---thermo meaning heat, haline meaning salt. The global
thermohaline circulation is sometimes described as a conveyor belt, but
the metaphor only extends so far in a system as fickle and shifting as
the ocean. In time, the once-tropical water resurfaces, although this
may be anywhere from 100 to 1,000 years later depending on the path it
takes. In this simplified sense, we can [imagine]{.underline} the
[AMOC]{.underline} [as]{.underline} one part of a great complex of ocean
currents [responsible]{.underline} [for shifting massive amounts of salt
and heat around the planet.]{.underline} Along with events like the
breakup of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, boreal forest
dieback, and a permanent El Niño in the Pacific[, [an AMOC shutdown is
considered **a tipping point in Earth's climate
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tipping points are thresholds that, once
crossed, rapidly alter the equilibrium of the planet. [[Scientists
believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that during the Younger Dryas, the [[AMOC
collapsed after]{.mark} massive amounts of freshwater from [melting ice
sheets flooded]{.mark} into [the North Atlantic]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The water there became too fresh and light to sink. The result
severed---or at the very least, severely weakened---the connection
between the AMOC's upper and lower flows, altering the global
thermohaline circulation at large. The very nature of how heat moved
around the planet had changed. [As Earth warms and melting freshwater
from the Greenland Ice Sheet cascades into the North
Atlantic,]{.underline} [many scientists fear that the stage is now set
for a repeat]{.underline} of the Younger Dryas. By some estimates, [[the
AMOC has slowed by]{.mark} 10 to [15 percent]{.mark} in the past
century]{.underline}, **[leading to concern that the system could be
headed for a collapse]{.underline}**. "[A substantial
weakening]{.underline} or shutdown [of AMOC **would be
catastrophic**]{.underline}," says Jerry McManus, an Earth scientist at
Columbia University who studies past changes in climate and ocean
circulation. [[Computational models suggest]{.mark} that [Europe]{.mark}
[could]{.mark} [plunge]{.mark} [into]{.mark} temperatures not felt since
the last [Ice Age]{.mark}, [while]{.mark} parts of [the southern
hemisphere would bake]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The eastern seaboard of the
United States would see a rapid increase in sea level]{.underline}
[rise]{.underline}, [while the [monsoon rains]{.mark}]{.underline}, on
whose regularity so much of the world relies, [[would slip
south]{.underline}. [Mass migration would take
place]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Agricultural systems would
collapse]{.mark}. **[War and political upheaval would]{.mark} likely
[follow]{.mark}**]{.underline} as people scrambled to adapt. The very
fabric of life would be changed across much of the planet. "Our [society
is struggling with a degree]{.underline} or two [of
change]{.underline}," says McManus. "**[[We couldn't possibly cope with
4 degrees]{.underline}]{.mark}** in, say, a decade." In the summer of
2023, siblings Peter and Susanne Ditlevsen of [the University of
Copenhagen published a study warning of]{.underline} impending AMOC
collapse. Using records of sea surface temperatures collected since the
1870s, they developed a new statistical approach to modeling the AMOC's
strength over time. Their model predicted a likely [collapse around the
year 2057]{.underline}, with a 95 percent chance of this happening
before 2095 and a slight chance that it could arrive by 2025. By
contrast, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had
previously said the AMOC would slow during this century but not likely
collapse before 2100. The findings were published in the journal Nature
Communications and set off a media frenzy. "Gulf Stream could collapse
as early as 2025, study suggests," read one headline that conflated the
AMOC with the better-known Gulf Stream. (This happens often; the Gulf
Stream, a wind-driven current that runs along the western edge of the
mid-Atlantic before arcing toward Europe, is part of the AMOC. The Gulf
Stream's future circulation is indeed a matter of concern, but it
occupies just one stage on the AMOC's grand theater.) "Is a Mega Ocean
Current about to Shut Down?" read another. "Scientists detect sign that
a crucial ocean current is near collapse." Many oceanographers pushed
back against the study's claims. Some questioned how much could be
gleaned from sea surface temperatures when so much of the AMOC's
behavior is dictated by salinity and temperature at depth. One model,
others noted, is hardly representative of scientific consensus. While
scientists generally agreed that the AMOC could stop as a consequence of
global warming, predicting if and when this would happen was very
difficult. "There's no tipping element on Earth for which we can predict
a tipping time at this point," says Niklas Boers, an Earth scientist at
the Technical University of Munich who specializes in modeling climate
tipping points. "To predict down to an exact time of collapse is nearly
impossible." The barriers to predictability, Boers explains, involve the
nuances of modeling and the data that underlie it. Some models, like the
one used by the Ditlevsens, use proxies like sea surface temperatures to
represent the entire system as a whole. Among their limitations is
uncertainty in long-term historical data. For example, even though
temperature and salinity records go back to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, early collection methods were unrefined and sparse by today's
standards. Other models are physics-based: They attempt to digitally
recreate the complexity of oceanic and atmospheric physics. Among their
limitations is computer power. "Even on the best supercomputers, our
most advanced climate models can take six months to a year to run," says
Boers. To work around these constraints---and also the ocean's
staggering complexity---models can be run at lower resolutions or be
simplified. These models provide critical insights into ocean dynamics
but are far from being a true "digital twin" of the ocean. Leading
climate models, like the ones underlying the IPCC reports, do suggest
that the AMOC will slow, but few have foretold a complete collapse
except under extreme climate scenarios. Recently, however[, a
study]{.underline} led by oceanographer René van Westen of Utrecht
University grabbed headlines after its model [found that even a gradual
freshwater increase in the North Atlantic]{.underline}---as might be
expected [from melting glaciers]{.underline} [and the]{.underline}
Greenland [ice sheet]{.underline}---[would]{.underline} eventually [lead
to a sudden AMOC shutdown.]{.underline} (They also modeled the global
climate consequences, which included temperatures falling by more than
10 degrees Fahrenheit across much of Europe and a flip-flopping of the
Amazon's rainy and dry seasons, which would push that system toward its
own tipping point.) The researchers concluded that an AMOC collapse
could no longer be considered theoretical under current climate
conditions and that "[the present-day AMOC is on route to
tipping.]{.underline}" Still, they noted that it remains impossible to
know precisely how near or far that threshold is. Despite the robust
evidence from climate models, an AMOC slowdown has not yet been
confirmed through direct observations. Only since 2004 have scientists
used ocean-spanning sensor arrays to continuously measure the system;
these provide insight into its dynamics, but it's too soon to know
whether the slowdown they've detected is part of AMOC's natural
variability versus a long-term trend. [Oceans are non-linear and chaotic
systems]{.underline}. [Nothing scales in a straight line, and small
perturbations **can cause large changes**.]{.underline} To understand
the mechanisms of and threshold for an AMOC tipping point is to
understand a great Gordian knot of factors: CO2, freshwater forcing,
relative density, vertical mixing, net evaporation, wind patterns,
pressure gradients, bathymetry, atmospheric forcing, Greenland Ice Sheet
stability---a list that can go on and on. Each force pulls on the
others, making the threshold for AMOC's collapse blurry and
ever-shifting. Better models and richer datasets may someday provide
more clarity, but for now the future can only be seen in low resolution.
There have been false alarms: In the early 2000s, researchers observed a
sharp slowdown in the AMOC that was not predicted by scientific models.
Some scientists feared that an AMOC tipping point was imminent. The
circulation rebounded. In the aftermath of the Ditlevsen and van Westen
studies, scientists who were asked to respond faced a conundrum: How
should they convey uncertainty without downplaying severity? Could they
leave room for nuance without making space for climate deniers? Or
should they ring the figurative alarm and shout "FIRE!" even if the
probabilities might only be small and distant? "Uncertainty is a very
tough topic in this field to convey," says Nick Foukal, a physical
oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. If a researcher
expresses certainty about something that doesn't come true, "you're held
up as an example of not telling the truth. But if you say that
something's not likely, people just ignore you." [Yet [when the stakes
of an AMOC collapse are so high, it's hard not to ring the
alarms]{.underline}. **[Existential risk changes the communications
calculus]{.underline}**.]{.mark} A 5 percent chance of a paper cut
warrants a very different response than a 5 percent chance of a climate
upheaval and ecological collapse. Even so, Foukal cautioned, many
"unknown unknowns" remain to be discovered about the AMOC. While in the
past it appears to have alternated between strong and weak modes, the
system may also have intermediary states. As sea ice melts, key
overturning locations could migrate to saltier or colder regions of the
ocean where water still becomes dense enough to sink. Perhaps those
patterns change some ocean dynamics---but not devastatingly so. "There's
good evidence to show that AMOC may be more resilient than we think,"
Foukal says. Yet [[even if the AMOC's future is more
nuanced]{.underline}]{.mark} than the headlines suggest, **[[none
of]{.mark} the possible [outcomes are something humanity should]{.mark}
want to [explore]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} adds Kjetil Våge, an
oceanographer at the University of Bergen. "[[All]{.underline}]{.mark}
these [[scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
essentially [[undesirable]{.underline}]{.mark} scenarios," he says. "We
are doing large-scale experiments to our global climate system. We don't
understand how these experiments are going to unfold." Waiting for a
definitive answer about the AMOC's future is a bit like waiting for a
doctor's test results. We know we're sick, but is it fatal? Are we
doomed or is there something we can do? In a better world, our models
and observations would encompass the full complexity of the AMOC. We
would know the exact limits of the system and just how to safely conduct
our lives within those bounds. For now, many scientists say it's best to
err on the side of caution. "Not being able to predict a tipping point
doesn't imply less urgency in trying to prevent or reduce the
probability of tipping," Boers says. "Until we can rule out that such a
tipping is possible, then the larger the uncertainties, the further away
we should stay away from greenhouse gas and temperature thresholds."
[What remains clear is that]{.underline} an abrupt climate shift is too
risky to bet against, and [[changes to AMOC can render]{.mark} **quick
and [catastrophic]{.mark}** [changes]{.mark} [to]{.mark} climate
patterns across [the globe]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we continue to pump
greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, we are not just hoping that we
can stave off the worst of rising temperatures, changing weather
patterns, and sea level rise, but gambling that the physics underpinning
our lives remains stable enough that adaptation remains possible. But on
this planet, things can get weird fast. [[Past a certain threshold,
**conditions are not**]{.mark} **necessarily [friendly to our
existence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Perhaps God does not play dice, but we
do, as we continue to play out a high-stakes climate game with imperfect
information. [Recent studies show that the Gulf Stream current is
slowing. Sea ice is at record lows]{.underline}. [Ocean temperature
records are breakin]{.underline}g left and right, [while]{.underline} in
[the North Atlantic]{.underline} a region of mysterious
[cooling]{.underline} [is seen]{.underline} by some scientists
[as]{.underline} further [evidence of the AMOC's shifting
dynamics]{.underline}. Change is coming, and each new finding is like
the rattle that signals a train's approach. Something is rumbling in the
ocean. What its future state looks like remains to be seen. It might not
be as bad as some fear. It may be worse than we can imagine.

#### Specifically, an AMOC shutdown causes a global methane burst -- positive feedback loops will spiral out of control

Thom **Hartmann**, 7/27/**23**, (NYT Bestselling Author), The Hartmann
Report, "Is Earth Close to 'The Great Dying'?",
https://hartmannreport.com/p/is-earth-close-to-the-great-dying-7ff, mm

Perhaps most alarming was a paper published eleven months ago in The
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
America (PNAS) titled "Evidence for Massive Methane Hydrate
Destabilization During the Penultimate Interglacial Warming." It brings
up the topic of [[the]{.mark} "[Clathrate Gun
Hypothesis]{.mark}]{.underline}," which **[[is the]{.mark} absolute
[worst case scenario for humanity's future]{.mark}.]{.underline}** All
across the planet [[there]{.mark} [are]{.mark} an estimated [1.4
trillion tons of methane gas frozen]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} a snowcone-like slurry called [clathrates or
methane [hydrates]{.mark}]{.underline} laying on the sea floor off the
various continental shelfs. [[When they]{.mark} suddenly melt[, that's
the "firing of the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[gun]{.underline}]{.mark}." [An
explosion]{.underline} (in the context of geologic time) [of atmospheric
gas that's over 70 times as potent a greenhouse gas as CO2]{.underline}.
The Clathrate Gun. The PNAS paper mentioned above concludes that
[[126,000 years ago]{.underline}]{.mark} there was [[an
event]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[caused]{.mark} a small amount of these
[clathrates]{.mark} [to warm]{.mark}]{.underline} enough
[to]{.underline} turn to gas and [bubble up out of the
seas]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting [[spike
in]{.underline}]{.mark} greenhouse gas ([[methane]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[led to a major warming event]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}: "Our
results identify an exceptionally large warming of the equatorial
Atlantic intermediate waters and strong evidence of methane release and
oxidation almost certainly due to massive methane hydrate
destabilization during the early part of the penultimate warm episode
(126,000 to 125,000 y ago). [[This]{.mark} major warming [was caused
by]{.mark}]{.underline} [... [a]{.underline}]{.mark} brief episode of
meltwater-induced [[weakening of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation ([[AMOC]{.underline}]{.mark}) and
amplified by a warm mean climate." The researchers warn [we may be
looking at a similar event in our time]{.underline}: "Our results
highlight climatic feedback processes associated with the penultimate
climate warming that can serve as a paleoanalog for modern ongoing
warming." As glaciers melt and the oceans warm, they note:
"\[[[M\]eltwater-induced AMOC]{.underline}]{.mark} weakening
significantly [[amplifies the warming of intermediate waters
and]{.mark},]{.underline} in turn, [[destabilizes]{.mark}]{.underline}
shallow subsurface [[methane hydrate deposits]{.underline}]{.mark}." In
other words, [the]{.underline} recent extreme [warming of our oceans
increases the chances [the AMOC]{.mark} Great Conveyor Belt will [shut
down]{.mark}]{.underline}, throwing Europe into an existential crisis
and wilding the rest of the world's weather. [And]{.underline}, most
ominously, the AMOC shutting down [[will]{.mark} [speed up the melting
of]{.mark} more [methane clathrates]{.mark}]{.underline} on the sea
floors around the world. The process is driven by warming of the oceans,
which absorb more than 90 percent of the addition global warming heat
we're forcing by burning fossil fuels. As the BBC noted, the past month
and first weeks of July "were hotter than any in recorded history" and:
"This week, sea surface temperatures along the coasts of Southern Spain
and North Africa were 2-4C (3.6-7.2F) higher than they would normally be
at this time of year, with some spots 5C (9F) above the long-term
average." Ocean temperatures off the coast of Florida this week were in
the range that Jacuzzi recommends for their hot tubs: 101 degrees. This
has never happened before in human history. [The]{.underline} least
likely but [most dangerous outcome]{.underline} scenario [is
that]{.underline} the [warming]{.underline} ocean [might begin a massive
melting of those]{.underline} methane [hydrate slurries into gas,
producing a "burp" of that greenhouse gas into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, further adding to global warming, which would
then melt even more of the clathrates. [[It would be a deadly "positive
feedback system]{.underline},"]{.mark} [with each phase]{.underline} of
warming [setting up]{.underline} the next and worse one. **[The
Clathrate Gun]{.underline}**. [[At the end of the
Permian]{.underline}]{.mark}, 250 million years ago, [[this]{.mark}
runaway process]{.underline} is apparently what happened when a spike in
[methane [led to such a violent warming]{.mark} of the planet [that it
killed over **90 percent of all life in the oceans and 70 percent of all
life on land**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [paving the way for]{.underline}
the rise of the dinosaurs, as cold-blooded lizards were among the few
survivors. That period is referred to as the Permian Mass Extinction,
or, simply, "[The Great Dying]{.underline}." **[[It was the most
destructive mass extinction]{.mark} event [in]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of our planet]{.underline}**. Eight years ago, Leonardo
DiCaprio and I put together and co-narrated a 12-minute video about this
exact scenario, interviewing some of the world's top climate scientists.
The "clathrate gun hypothesis" is controversial, but there's a large
body of evidence for it having done the damage at the end of the
Permian, as we note in that video. While it's the least likely but most
dramatic outcome of today's global warming, it's worth heeding the
warning: by pouring over thirty billion tons of carbon into the
atmosphere every year we have stirred a beast that could --- if we don't
take serious action soon --- spell the doom of human civilization, if
not humanity itself. As the scientists writing in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences noted: "The key findings of our study add
to a growing body of observational findings strongly supporting the
'clathrate gun hypothesis.' ... Importantly, the interval we have
studied is marked by a mean climate state comparable to future
projections of transient global climate warming of 1.3 °C to 3.0 °C."
\[emphasis mine\] [We just]{.underline} this year [passed 1.3
degrees]{.underline} Celsius [of]{.underline} planetary
[warming]{.underline}: [we are]{.underline} now [in the territory of the
Clathrate Gun Hypothesi]{.underline}s if these researchers are right
(although the risks are still small). This is the first study I've seen
to make such a claim, and it's not from crackpots or alarmists; these
are solid, credible scientists with a lifetime of learning and work
behind them. [And]{.underline}, they argue[, if the AMOC weakens or
shuts down]{.underline}, **[all bets are off]{.underline}**:
"[Simulation studies have suggested warming of intermediate waters has

magnitude of intermediate water warming can be significantly amplified
by meltwater-induced weakening of atmospheric and ocean
circulation]{.underline}, an amplification not considered in the
simulations that examined potential gas hydrate destabilization." In

In all the sound and fury over climate change, [too little]{.underline}
public and [media attention has been devoted to [the 'methane
gun']{.mark}]{.underline} (1) -- and yet [this]{.underline} terrifying
phenomenon [[could usher humans]{.underline}]{.mark} unceremoniously
**[[off Earth's stage for good]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Like CO2, methane
(CH4) is a greenhouse gas that helps trap the sun's heat within the
Earth's atmosphere. The big difference is that it is 25-84 times more
potent at doing so. [The planet has massive stores of
methane]{.underline}, [locked]{.underline} as frozen ice in the seabed
(the world's largest natural gas reserve), [in the frozen soils of
the]{.underline} Canadian, US and Russian [Arctic]{.underline}, and
buried in the sediments of tropical swamps and peatlands. Like the
bubbles in a stagnant pond, the gas is mostly the work of bacteria
digesting organic matter over millions of years. How large these
reserves of methane are is still a matter for scientific debate -- but
estimates fall between 1.5 and 5 trillion tonnes. Very, very large
indeed. [If released suddenly, these are thought more than capable of
driving the Earth's temperature up by another 7-10 degrees]{.underline},
[on top of the 2-5 degrees likely to result from human
emissions]{.underline} from burning fossil fuels and clearing land
(currently rising at record rates (2)). [[The worst-case
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a large-scale, rapid release of trapped
gas known as the 'methane gun' -- [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
potentially **[[render the Earth uninhabitable]{.mark} by
humans]{.underline}** and other large animals. This is why we need to
pay attention. Now. What has some scientists concerned -- and others
frightened -- is that [atmospheric levels of methane]{.underline} which
have doubled since the Industrial Revolution and have been rising for
steadily for the past 30 years, began to rise more steeply in the past
five years, as the following graph shows: The source of the new methane
is debated. Is it mainly caused by the mining of natural gas, petroleum
and coal -- as several lines of evidence suggest? Is it released by
expanding world cattle and rice production, the draining of tropical
swamps and burning of tropical forests? Is it the frozen gas seeping out
of the oceans and tundra as the planet warms and its ice vanishes? Or is
it all of the above? The evidence is starting to favour the latter view
(3) -- but the scientific jury remains undecided. We know that a
mass-release of methane can be catastrophic for life on Earth, because
that's exactly what took place 55 million years ago in an event known as
PETM -- the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum -- when global
temperatures shot up by 5-10 degrees, wiping out a number of species
(4). There were no humans round then to release carbon, so it was
probably due to one or more of the natural sources rapidly giving up its
gas. Recently opinion has narrowed in favour of tropical swamps and
peatlands drying out and catching fire during a warming cycle, as the
main source. The frozen methane, apparently, remained largely
undisturbed in the ocean and tundra. But that is not the case today. Not
only are tropical forests burning and swamps being drained, but
[[scientists have observed major escapes of methane from the Arctic
tundra]{.underline}]{.mark} in the form of exploding pingos -- mounts of
frozen methane, mud and water -- [[and the]{.mark} eruption of melted
methane ice from the [seabed]{.mark}]{.underline}. In October 2019
veteran Russian researcher Igor Semiletor, from Tomsk Polytechnic
University, reported "the most powerful seep I have ever been able to
observe" venting in a potent eruption of gas bubbles in the East
Siberian Sea (5). Two years earlier, in June 2017, Russian reindeer
herders reported a violent explosion that left a 50- metre deep crater
in the tundra of the Yamal Peninsula, Siberia, which scientists
attributed to a methane blast. In recent years researchers have reported
numerous craters left by explosions across Siberia, the Canadian and
Alaskan tundra -- and even craters in the seabed. Many are recent -- but
some are up to 12,000 years old, and still leaking gas. Therein lies the
uncertainty: are the methane explosions observed today part of a process
that occurs more or less constantly through Earth history -- or do they
represent the start of a sudden release, ramping up to runaway global
warming? The scientific jury is at odds. Pennsylvania State climate
scientist Prof Michael Mann, for instance, characterises the methane
bomb idea as "catastrophism" and claims it is being exploited by the
climate denial lobby to discredit climate theory generally. He says the
amount of methane released will be "small compared to human emissions"
of carbon (6). Other scientists, like Gavin Schmidt of the NASA Goddard
Institute, argue that it is highly unlikely that a large volume of
seabed methane would be released suddenly, i.e. over a period less than
thousands of years, because it did not do so in past warming events.
Instead it will continue to trickle out. Oceanography and ice expert
Prof Peter Wadhams disagrees. He says [[loss of Arctic sea ice]{.mark}
from the shallow continental margins [could trigger]{.mark} such [a
release]{.mark} which "could happen [very]{.mark} [suddenly]{.mark} and
... is the greatest single threat that we face]{.underline}". He says
that mainstream science, represented by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), does not generally recognise the threat (7).
Australian National University earth scientist Prof. Andrew Glikson
cites the Global Carbon project finding that there are 1.4 trillion
tonnes of accumulated methane stored on land and 16 trillion tonnes in
the ocean, available for release if the planet grew warm enough, and
this 'could have catastrophic effects on the biosphere'. He points out
there is already clear evidence for the explosive release of methane, on
land and at sea. With Arctic temperatures already 3-8 degrees warmer due
to global warming, the risks of a sudden methane release "have not yet
been fully accounted for in climate projections" (8). At temperatures
above +4 degrees, many scientists now consider the risk is increasing of
the planet becoming partly or wholly uninhabitable to humans and large
animals. Certainly, [[such]{.mark} heat and [climate]{.mark}
[instability]{.mark} [would destroy]{.mark} most of [our]{.mark} current
[food production systems]{.mark}, spilling billions of climate refugees
across the planet [and causing wars to break out]{.mark} between and
within nation states]{.underline} (9). How many would die in such an
event is not knowable, because [[we cannot predict]{.underline}]{.mark}
how humans will respond, how many wars we will start, or [[how many
nukes we will unleash in the]{.mark} ensuing
[chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}. Potsdam Institute climatologist John
Schellnhuber has said: "[At 4 C Earth's]{.underline}... [carrying
capacity estimates are below 1 billion people."]{.underline} Prof Kevin
Anderson of the U.K.'s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change concurs: "Only
about 10 per cent of the planet's population would survive at 4 C."
Several scientists have voiced the view that the human population will
be reduced from 9-10 billion to around 1-3 billion in the long run (10).
We already know that our physical survival is in jeopardy in extended
periods above 35 degrees Celsius -- that is, where daytime temperatures
constantly reach 40-50 degrees C or more. Such temperatures will occur
frequently with +7 degrees of global warming and will render large parts
of the earth uninhabitable -- including the most heavily populated.
Above +12 degrees of global warming, human survival becomes physically
impossible (11). However [long before our heat tolerance limits are
reached, local and global food and water supplies will collapse,
prompting mass migration and war]{.underline}. Without urgent worldwide
action, [the global economy -- and with it civilized society -- are
predicted to go down as we approach +4 degrees]{.underline}. Such
warnings come, not from 'radical greens', but from authorities no less
conservative than Bank of England governor Marc Carney (12), who states
that the global financial system is currently investing in catastrophe
by backing new fossil fuel projects (13). These numbers represent the
current most-informed estimates of the impact of the unfolding climate
crisis, should world efforts to halt it fail and should the climate
deniers triumph. [The risk for humanity posed by the 'methane gun' is
that rapid global mass-release may be 'locked and loaded']{.underline}
and firing before we have sufficient scientific data to confirm it. It
is, as they say, an event of low probability -- but very high impact. Is
it a risk that a rational person would take? [[Once the gun has begun to
fire]{.underline}, **[there is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[practically
[nothing humans can do to stop it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [It
will unleash other dangerous feedbacks, potentially leading to runaway
warming. [It will shift the planet]{.mark}]{.underline} from its present
warming state [[to a 'hothouse Earth']{.mark} state]{.underline} (14)
**[[where human survival comes into question]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### 1AC -- Arctic Conflict Advantage

#### Arctic melting is sparking a regional arms race between NATO and Russia -- preserving sea ice is key to obstructing development in the region and preventing a conflict spiral that escalates into a superpower conflict -- only geoengineering solves

As the Munich Security Conference gets underway, [[the spectre of a
third world war loom]{.mark}s on the horizon]{.underline}. [Military and
political [leaders in NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} nations have issued
chilling warnings for populations to [[brace for]{.mark} the possibility
of devastating [superpower]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Admiral Rob Bauer, chair of NATO's Military Committee, fired the opening
salvo in the grim round of predictions. He cautioned that [[Russia could
launch an attack within]{.mark} the next [two
decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. In words reminiscent of World War II,
Bauer urged allied countries to mobilise citizen armies. British Defence
Secretary Grant Shapps has gone even further, foreseeing potential wars
involving China, Russia, North Korea and Iran within the next five
years. The situation is transitioning "from a post-war to pre-war
world", he asserted bleakly. General Sir Patrick Sanders, the UK's army
chief, echoed that dark prediction. He described the British population
as a "pre-war generation" that may need to prepare for conflict with an
increasingly aggressive Russia. German politicians and military leaders
have discussed resurrecting mandatory military service in response to
growing threats and Sweden has already introduced a form of national
service as it closes in on NATO membership. To many, the idea that
increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks on Ukraine could lurch
towards a wider European conflict seems not only probable but
inevitable. However, [amid the drumbeats of international conflict, one
crucial factor is being overlooked]{.underline}: **[the impact of
climate change as a potential trigger for war]{.underline}**. NATO has
committed to taking a leading international role on climate and
security. Yet the landmark climate agreement reached late last year at
the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for Western leaders
meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and translate them
into tangible action. [NATO recognises climate change as a 'threat
amplifier' for traditional security issues]{.underline}, but it needs to
go further as studies indicate [[global warming is]{.mark} already
rapidly [accelerating]{.mark} [the likelihood of armed conflict]{.mark},
**especially in [the Arct]{.mark}ic.** Arctic [icecaps are
melting]{.mark} at record rates, [making]{.mark} [deposits]{.mark} of
gas, oil and minerals [worth trillions]{.mark} of dollars
[accessible]{.mark} for the first time. Over the coming years, [this
will spark a race for]{.mark} Arctic [dominance]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
**[Russia]{.mark} [is hellbent on winning]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [With
Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline]{.underline},
Vladimir [Putin believes domination of the region's resources is
critical to the economic survival of his regime]{.underline}. The Arctic
is estimated to hold 412 billion barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of
the world's undiscovered reserves. Putin is hardly trying to hide his
agenda. [[Russia]{.mark} already operates a third [more]{.mark} Arctic
[military bases]{.mark} [than the US]{.mark} and its NATO allies. Now
Putin is moving soldiers, icebreakers, warships and submarines to the
region,]{.underline} as well as conducting Arctic drills that test
hypersonic missiles capable of evading American defences. His propaganda
machine regularly releases pictures of troops training in white fatigues
and clutching assault weapons as they zip over the snow on sleighs
pulled by reindeer. America and Denmark have filed sovereignty claims in
the central Arctic Ocean but it was Moscow that, in 2007, planted a
titanium Russian flag on the seabed two-and-a-half miles under the North
Pole. [More [aggressive Russian claims]{.mark} in the Arctic [could
force NATO to act and **risk sparking the global
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} that the generals and politicians are
warning of. While traditional military preparations for global war are
undoubtedly vital, [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} convening at Munich
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[prioritise climate
action]{.underline}]{.mark} [to mitigate the risk of global warming
becoming the catalyst for a catastrophic clash]{.underline}. Following
the COP28 agreement to 'transition away from fossil fuels', NATO must
modify its climate ambitions and let the consensus reached in Dubai
guide its strategy to head off the threat of global war provoked by
climate change. The Dubai agreement has been endorsed by 198 countries,
including NATO allies. However, in the words of COP28 President Sultan
Al Jaber, who is also attending the Munich conference: "An agreement is
only as good as its implementation ... We must take the steps necessary
to turn this agreement into tangible action." NATO's focus should extend
beyond its current voluntary emissions reduction targets to include
COP28's agreement to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. [[Since
halting Arctic warming is pivotal to preventing conflict]{.mark},
[NATO]{.mark} [must]{.mark} also [explore]{.mark} safe
[geoengineering]{.mark} solutions **[to slow or reverse Arctic
melting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is time for world leaders to act in
the knowledge that [failure]{.underline} [to]{.underline} urgently
[address the climate emergency exposes the world to the risk of a
devastating conflict between NATO and Russia]{.underline}, as well as
the wider environmental dangers of unchecked climate change.

#### Future development will change the geopolitics of the Arctic -- cooperation is giving way to competition and conflict

[While the Arctic region has always been an arena for
competition]{.underline} due to its geographic and historic
significance, [the conclusion of the Cold War saw nations shift
toward]{.underline} economic and environmental
[collaboration]{.underline} in the Arctic. [[As the region]{.mark}
[experiences]{.mark} rapidly [warming]{.mark} temperatures]{.underline}
and considerable changes to the landscape, however, [[global
superpowers' security strategies are reappearin]{.mark}g]{.underline}.
[The exploitation of natural resources, [economic opportunities]{.mark}
via new shipping routes, [and]{.mark} continued [disputes]{.mark}
[over]{.mark} state [boundaries]{.mark} [are making the region an arena
for]{.mark} security [competition]{.mark}]{.underline} as many states
all want to influence the future of the region. The paper explores the
current state of climate change in the Arctic and how it feeds into
geopolitics. Recent discussions reveal that some superpowers aim to
increase their presence in the Arctic as climate change has created more
economic opportunities in the region, even though increasing economic
activity would only continue to worsen climate change and environmental
degredation. As superpowers further encroach on the Arctic, it is
becoming increasingly apparent that discussions about regional security
can no longer be ignored. [[Collaboration]{.mark} between countries [is
rapidly moving towards competition]{.mark} to shape the future of the
region]{.underline}. Climate change and environmental degradation must
remain a regional priority; they must not be viewed as entirely separate
concerns but rather as interconnecting with regional security and
economic interests. With China, Russia, and the US all setting their
sights on Arctic expansion, this paper suggests the need for the
establishment of an organisation that facilitates security discussions
to tackle issues beyond the scope of the Arctic Council. The Arctic is
experiencing rapid changes in the environment. In 2019 alone, both
Alaska and Siberia experienced large, slow-burning forest fires. They
released 100 million tonnes of carbon and smoke covered an area larger
than the EU. Alaska saw a highly unseasonal 32 Celsius heatwave,
fuelling fires that released roughly three times more carbon than the
state emits annually from burning fossil fuels. Arctic air temperatures
are rising at twice the rate of the global average. As Hodgkins puts it,
"[[the loss of reflective snow and ice]{.underline}]{.mark} means more
solar energy will be absorbed in the ground and ocean, warming the
earth, causing more snow and ice to melt." This is significant because
it [[creates a feedback loop]{.mark} that amplifies warming, leading to
the thawing of the ground and the potential melting of
permafrost.]{.underline} Furthermore, the rapid loss of the Greenland
Ice Sheet and sustained loss of sea ice will contribute to rising sea
levels. The 2019 Arctic Climate Change Update produced by the Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) found that winter sea ice
maximums from 2015--2018 were at record low levels. In addition, the 12
lowest minimum extents of sea ice----the point when scientists say the
Arctic Ocean will freeze again---- have come in the last 12 years,
according to satellite records. Ice loss from Arctic glaciers,
especially the Greenland ice sheet, are the biggest contributors to
rising sea levels and will continue to lose mass over this century, even
if the goals of the Paris Agreement are met. Just this month, polar
scientists released an assessment of the Greenland ice sheet. The Ice
Sheet Mass Balance Inter-Comparison Exercise (IMBIE) is a consortium of
89 polar experts from 50 organisations. They reanalysed data from
satellites between 1992 and 2018, measuring thickness, flow, and gravity
and then combining the observations with the most recent weather and
climate models. The study had several significant conclusions. Firstly,
ice is being lost seven times faster than in the 1990s. Data from 1992
showed annual ice melt equivalent to 1mm of sea-level rise per decade,
but the current figure is 7mm. Secondly, since the start of the study
period, Greenland has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice. As the figure
below shows, the contribution to sea-level rise by Greenland is
following the pessimistic upper boundary projections provided by the
IPCC. [[Much of the hostility]{.mark} between nations [lies in the
difficulty to establish clear boundaries in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[resulting in disagreement over]{.mark}
the [ownership]{.mark} of the natural treasures within
them.]{.underline} Herein lies the challenge of establishing ownership.
Naturally, determining where one territory ends and another begins in
the sea is an extremely difficult, and often contentious, task. The
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the official
body that settles disputes over territory. To provide some clarity, the
convention separates the sea into specific areas to help establish
jurisdiction. The low water mark close to land is the baseline from
which the areas are measured. Territorial waters are the closest zone
and are considered to be up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. In
this area, the state can set laws, regulate usage, and use any of the
resources within it. Beyond that is another area of 12 nautical miles
called the contiguous zone. Here, the state can still enforce laws
relating to immigration, customs, taxation, and pollution. Up to 200
miles from the baseline is the exclusive economic zone (EEZ); this area
is typically where disputes arise. An EEZ gives the coastal state
exclusive rights to the natural resources under the sea, making it a
prime opportunity for exploitation and economic gain from oil, gas,
fisheries, etc. [The Arctic is rich in natural resources and
minerals]{.underline}. According to the US Geological Survey assessment
from 2008, 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered gas and 13 per cent
of undiscovered oil reserves lie close to the North Pole. [[Rivalry
over]{.mark} such enormous volumes of [resources]{.mark} [will]{.mark}
likely [intensify]{.mark} [as they become easier to
access]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [This tends to be the reason for
countries to be locked in territorial tussles.]{.underline} For example,
there are plenty of claims to the North Pole. Russia, Canada, Norway,
Denmark (via Greenland), and the US (via Alaska) have all presented
claims to the North Pole in the past. Elsewhere, the Beaufort Sea just
north of the Yukon and Alaska is disputed by the US and Canada and is
"thought to hide considerable hydrocarbon treasure." Similarly, the
Lomonosov Ridge----an enormous underwater ridge made of continental
crust that spans 1800km into the Arctic and including the North
Pole----remains disputed. Russia, Denmark, and Canada each believe the
ridge belongs to them and have submitted claims supporting that.
Diplomatic discussions continue but "the resolution of the dispute may
have profound effects on the balance of economic and perhaps even
strategic power in the Arctic." While UNCLOS provides a helpful
guideline for laws of the sea, it does not always lead to absolute
clarity on such issues. Decisions by UNCLOS can take many years, during
which time disputes may increase or additional claims might occur,
adding complexity to the issue. To make matters worse, even when
decisions are made, they may not be accepted by nations that are not a
member. For example, the US has not ratified UNCLOS, so unless decisions
are ruled in their favour, it is unlikely the US would simply accept
unfavourable decisions without considerable pushback. A rapidly warming
Arctic creates challenges beyond those highlighted above.
[[Several]{.mark} new [sea routes that were previously unnavigable are
now opening up]{.mark} as a result of melting ice. [These routes are
hotly contested]{.mark}]{.underline} as they provide companies with the
chance to minimise travel time and maximise profits. For example, the
Northern Sea Route, a passage north of Russia, significantly decreases
travel time from Europe to Asia. The World Economic Forum noted that the
largest shipping company in the world, Maersk, is exploring
possibilities to regularly use the Northern Sea Route instead of having
to travel south through the Suez Canal. This journey reduces the
distance by 40 per cent and the company has already partnered with a
company that uses icebreakers, suggesting their intention to pursue this
new route. While it is worth noting that this is expected to reduce
emissions from shipping due to less fuel requirements, it creates a
paradoxical scenario----to contribute less to climate change, shipping
companies must exploit a route only open due to the impacts of climate
change. Even more notable is the Northwest Passage. This route passes by
the top of Canada, a region where thick ice has previously prevented
access. Commercial feasibility in this area is expected to increase, and
trade flows will rapidly rise. Canada claims sovereignty over the
Passage and has publicly stated that it expects ships from other
countries to ask for permission before using the route. However, as an
article from the Economist (2019) notes, several European nations
alongside the US claim that they are international waters. Such globally
significant economic opportunities create a conflict of interests as
climate change, financial gain, and geopolitics are all at the forefront
of the regional agenda. The founding of the Arctic Council in 1996
brought together eight members: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Russia, Canada, and the United States. To ensure those on the
frontline of a rapidly changing environment have a voice, six indigenous
groups also have permanent membership to the Council. The Council was
established to enable cooperation on common Arctic issues, especially
sustainable development and environmental protection, deliberately
leaving security affairs off its agenda. The Ottawa Declaration, the
agreement that set up the Arctic Council, includes specific notes saying
that the Council should not be dealing with matters related to military
security. It is currently impossible, however, to ignore the changes in
nations' approach to the region as several states view the Arctic as a
central feature to their security strategy. While the Danish Arctic
Strategy aims to dispel the notion of a race for the Arctic and Sweden's
strategy hopes to ensure that security tensions are low, it seems as
though the superpowers have a different idea. De Neve et al (2015)
identify two different forms of security concerns in the Arctic: common
security and military security. In a speech at the Arctic Council Summit
in May of this year, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that ["the
region has become an arena for power and for competition]{.underline}.
And the eight Arctic states must adapt to this new future." This was of
special significance as it was the first time such a strategy had been
presented so publicly. There is no doubt that the security strategies of
Arctic states and other superpowers include such discussions behind
closed doors but, as Dams and Van Schaik (2019) put it, Pompeo "broke
both Arctic taboos: he hailed climate change as an economic opportunity
rather than a threat and called the Arctic an arena for power and
competition rather than science and cooperation." It is worth noting
that the US is by any means the only nation showing increasing interest
in economic and geopolitical opportunity in the Arctic. [Russia is
zeroing in on the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, claiming it as their
own and aiming to rapidly increase the number of goods transported
through the route over the coming years. The Russian Arctic provides
significant boosts to their economy relative to how few people inhabit
the region. [Russia's military presence]{.underline} there
[is]{.underline} also [growing]{.underline} as they have heavily
invested in new infrastructure, technology, and increased the number of
military bases. Elsewhere, there is considerable Russian presence in
Svalbard, a large Norwegian territory in the far north. The Arctic
Council summit seemingly kickstarted the ramping up of military security
concerns in 2019. In November, Denmark placed Greenland top of its
national security agenda, topping both cybercrime and terrorism. The
location of Greenland makes it strategically beneficial and a useful
middle ground between North America and Europe. The US already has an
airbase on the West coast, which it uses as an early warning system in
case of missile attacks. The major business opportunity in Greenland has
led to growing Danish concern. Most notably, President Trump expressing
his desire to buy Greenland earlier this year only confirmed such
concerns. The head of the Danish Defence Intelligence Service noted that
focus is switching to Greenland because a "power game is unfolding"
between global superpowers there. Interest comes from further afield,
too. [China has been vocal in its interests and has already established
economic deals.]{.underline} As part of Xi Jinping's Belt and Road
Initiative, China has invested in Russian liquefied natural gas and
established facilities in the Arctic. [Russia--China partnerships have
also been established to develop the]{.underline} Northern Sea Route;
the so-called [Polar Silk Road]{.underline} strategy hopes to benefit
enormously from shipping. China has signed trade deals with Iceland,
invested in multiple natural resource projects in Russia, and built a
research station in Svalbard. It is obvious that the Arctic is certainly
important to China and "despite the Arctic nations' shared ambition to
keep the region free of security policy disagreements, [[the military
focus on the Arctic is growing.]{.mark} [A power game is unfolding
between]{.mark} great powers [Russia, the United States and
China]{.mark} that deepens tensions [in the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}" It is increasingly obvious that
[geopolitics in the Arctic is staying for the foreseeable future.
[Climate change will exacerbate this]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The economic
utility of melting sea ice and increased accessibility to natural
resources attracts global superpowers both near and far from the
Arctic]{.underline}. [As the cat and mouse game]{.underline} of Arctic
expansion [begins to ramp up, [there is a **worrying lack of diplomatic
mechanisms to address the current security
issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the Arctic Council works towards
environmental protection and sustainable development, the inability to
address the regional politics threatens to undo their work. One
suggestion is to establish an Arctic Council Task Forces to investigate
how climate change will affect the security of Arctic nations. By
leveraging scientific expertise and the knowledge of indigenous groups,
it may be possible to pinpoint areas of potential conflict before they
occur. Bellen also suggests the proposal could be brought to the Council
when Russia regains the chair in 2021, conceding that this would delay
action and it would also be very difficult to implement anyway. Since
the US joined the Council under the agreement that security issues were
forbidden, it is highly unlikely that they would agree to such a
proposal. Conley and Melino (2016) proposed a redesign of the Arctic
Council to establish an Arctic security and cooperation organisation
that would take economic, human, and security dimensions into account.
However, the same limitations would apply. Dams and van Schaik (2019)
offer several ways to overcome the current diplomatic architecture. They
include a new EU Arctic strategy that places security and geopolitics at
the top of the agenda; EU members calling for an Arctic security and
cooperation organisation to include China, Russia, India, Japan, and the
USA (akin to the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable); and a NATO Arctic
strategy that tackles how and to what extent it could manage security
tensions in the Arctic. There are many ways in which security issues
could be included in international discussions, but it seems as though
states are turning a blind eye to a very obvious problem that needs
addressing[. As the climate warms and the sea ice melts,]{.underline}
these problems will intensify. It [is imperative that action is
taken]{.underline} sooner rather than later [to avoid potential
conflict.]{.underline}

infrastructure due to thawing permafrost and erosion that is already
affecting indigenous peoples. For thousands of years, people like the
Yup'ik Native Americans have lived as seasonal nomadic hunters.11 After
establishing the village of Newtok in 1949, the Yup'ik were recently
forced to abandon this settlement due to climate change. Twelve other
Artic communities may need to relocate.12 Relocation of these villages
presents both a financial, as well as a moral, challenge regarding how
to treat these Native Americans in an equitable fashion addressing both
their cultural and their financial needs. Permafrost thawing has
detrimental physical and economic effects on other Arctic
infrastructure. Approximately 70 percent of the infrastructure in the
global Arctic region is built on permafrost, of which 33 percent is
susceptible to severe damage from thaw-related ground instability. Much
of the Russian ocean ports, Siberian villages, industrial facilities,
and northern transportation facilities are threatened with collapse due
to the excessive warming in the northern regions. A recent example is
the oil spill from a storage tank that burst due to melting permafrost
in Norilsk Russia and sent 150,000 barrels of diesel fuel toward the
Arctic Ocean.13 Damage to buildings, power stations, pipelines,
manufacturing facilities, roads, and railways have a value estimated to
be in the \$100\'s of billions.14 [[These changes]{.underline}
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[increasing tensions]{.mark} in the area
that threaten U.S. national security]{.underline}. Since the end of the
Cold War the Arctic has largely been the domain of indigenous peoples,
nature and scientific research. While military communities have regarded
the region as a theatre of operations, the severe weather and prevailing
sea ice have made operations extremely difficult. The U.S. has
traditionally not devoted many resources in the area. The Arctic
Council, a key intergovernmental organization that is composed of
Russia, Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Iceland, Sweden, Finland, and the
United States, was nominated for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for its
collaborative efforts to preserve the Arctic for indigenous peoples and
scientific research. Global warming-induced changes in the Arctic are
jeopardizing these collaborative efforts. Loss of sea ice is
accelerating the effects of global warming. Retreating Arctic land and
sea ice and snow causes land erosion and permafrost thawing which
disrupt Arctic communities and their way of life[. [While]{.mark} the
[warming]{.mark} of the Arctic [is providing]{.mark} the
[potential]{.mark} for individual nation states [to exploit natural
resources]{.mark} [and]{.mark} open up [shipping lanes]{.mark} that are
in the short term economically attractive, [the longer-term
consequences]{.mark} of this warming [could]{.mark} be destabilizing and
threaten to [unravel]{.mark} long-standing [cooperation]{.mark} among
Arctic nations]{.underline}. [The possibility of [an ice-free]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark} summer will make clear water passages possible in the
Arctic for the first time in human history, potentially opening up the
region to commercial shipping, mineral extraction, fishing and tourism
thereby increasing tensions in the region]{.underline} (see Figure 2).
If all nations vie for access to these open sea lanes and natural
resources, [it]{.underline} [[will change the balance of power]{.mark}
in the region. Both Russia and Canada have proposed charging for passage
through the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (NSR) [and North West
Passage]{.underline} (NWP), respectively.15 In a 2019 speech before the
Arctic Council, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said that the
Trump administration believes "the region has become an arena for power
and for competition."16 Also, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([[NATO) refers to the region as one of great power
competition]{.underline}]{.mark} as Russia and other nations look to
exploit undersea natural resources.17 A number of states are responding
to one of the most dramatic and significant drivers of climate change
consequences around the globe---the melting of the Arctic---not by
increasing cooperation on addressing climate change, but rather by
maneuvering for geostrategic advantage.18 For example, [[Russia is
moving aggressively]{.mark} to expand and secure its position in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Since Russia has no warm water ports with access to
open ocean it must depend on its Arctic installations for direct access
to the sea. Russian President Vladimir [Putin portrays the NSR as a
future "global, competitive transport artery]{.underline}" that is "the
key to the development of the Russian Arctic and the regions of the Far
East.19 Rob Huebert, senior research fellow with the Center for Military
and Strategic Studies, warns that "[[Russia is serious about the]{.mark}
militarization, [remilitarization]{.mark}, or securitization [of the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}"20 He points out that [the revival of air
and land bases,]{.underline} officially for search and rescue purposes,
also [possess runway capacities to handle Russia\'s bomber and fighter
fleets.]{.underline} Russia has resumed fighter patrols, and has tested
the Kinzhal Dagger hypersonic missile in the region.21 [[The Russian
government]{.mark} currently [has over 50 airfields and ports]{.mark} in
the Arctic region.]{.underline} Russia has an icebreaker fleet that is
significantly larger than that of all other Arctic nations combined and
is preparing to launch its first weaponized icebreaker in 2023.22 By
contrast the United States has one operational heavy icebreaker, U.S.
Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Polar Star, and one medium icebreaker, USCGC
Healy. The United States recently issued a contract for three new Polar
Security Cutters, the first of which is expected to be delivered in
2024.23 Top U.S. military officials have voiced concerns about Russia\'s
aggressive moves in the Arctic. Testifying before the Senate Armed
Services Committee in April 2017, Admiral Harry Harris, U.S. Pacific
Command, said: "Of particular note are Russian efforts to build presence
and influence in the High North. Russia has more bases north of the
Arctic Circle than all other countries combined, and is building more
with distinctly military capabilities."24 In testimony before the same
panel in 2018, General Curtis Scaparrotti, U.S. European Command,
cautioned that [Russia is revitalizing its northern fleet and bases in
"anticipation of increased military activity. Russia is increasing its
qualitative advantage in Arctic operations, and its military bases will
serve to reinforce Russia\'s position with the threat of
force]{.underline}."25 [[China]{.mark} also sees economic opportunity in
an ice-free Arctic and [is moving to secure a position]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. It sees the potential for a cheaper northern
passage for goods (as opposed to transiting through the Panama Canal),
and a source of oil and natural resources. [China has declared itself an
Arctic nation]{.underline} and in 2013, the Arctic Council granted it
"Observer" status. [[China has expanded its Belt and Road]{.mark}
Initiative]{.underline} (BRI), its global development infrastructure
project, [[to include a "Polar Silk Road]{.underline}"]{.mark} strategy
to expand its influence in the Arctic region. The new initiative
encourages the building of infrastructure and expanding commercial
shipping routes. [Of greater concern to the U.S. and its allies should
be China\'s move to solidify its role in the region by partnering with
Arctic nations]{.underline}. In 2017 Premier Xi Jinping called for China
and Russia to jointly build the Polar Silk Road through the Arctic,
fostering greater East-West trade.26 Recent reports suggest that
[[Russia has requested]{.mark} that [China help]{.mark} finance and
[develop]{.mark} Russian [ports]{.mark} and infrastructure along its
NSR]{.underline}. These press reports are consistent with China\'s
wishes to "work with all parties to build a "Polar Silk Road" by
"encouraging its enterprises" to "participate in infrastructure
construction" for polar routes. [There also have been reports of China
expressing an interest in developing Arctic routes with
Canada]{.underline}.27 [[U.S. military installations]{.mark} in the
Arctic region [are becoming more difficult]{.mark} and expensive [to
operate]{.mark} [because of]{.mark} land erosion and permafrost melting
caused by global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [Thule Air
Force Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation in the world and
the only one north of the Arctic circle, represents U.S. interests in
the Arctic region and is a critical component of U.S. Air Force Space
Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command.]{.underline}28
The radar systems located at Thule are a central component of the U.S.
early warning system that are tasked with detection and tracking
Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles heading for North America. [Thule
already experiences damage its runways and taxiways due to thawing
permafrost.]{.underline}29 [This is an example of the increased costs
and consequences of expanding U.S. operations in the area. [The DoD
considers climate change]{.mark} as [a threat]{.mark} [to]{.mark} our
[national security]{.mark} and a complication to U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}. In 2016, The Center for Climate & Security stated
The U.S. military has for years been a leader in addressing the risk to
national security posed by climate change---a phenomenon that acts as a
"threat multiplier," exacerbating natural disasters, water, food and
energy insecurities, contributing to conditions that can catalyze
conflict, instability, and state failure, and exacerbating existing
security risks ... to U.S. national security, and potentially creating
new ones.30 In particular, water and food scarcity leads to mass
migrations, especially in parts of the world that are least prepared to
adapt.31 Today, almost 785 million people do not have access to clean
water and almost two billion lack access to adequate sanitation. It is
reasonable to expect that this number may double.32 Climate change
contributes to high tide flooding with severe storms surges in coastal
regions. World-wide, between 340 million and 500 million people live on
land that is projected to be below annual flood levels by 2050 and 2100,
respectively. This scenario would create an enormous refugee crisis.
These kinds of climate-enhanced disasters destabilize governments and
fuel radicalization.33 The drought that led to the mass migrations in
Darfur in the Sudan is largely regarded as triggering the first mass
migrations that can be linked to climate change.34 Current violent
conflicts, such as in Syria and Yemen, have been linked by several
scholars to prolonged water scarcity.35 Climate change exacerbated
severe drought in the Fertile Crescent, driving farmers to move to the
cities, and helped trigger uprisings that eventually led to the Syrian
civil war.36,37 To be sure, poor decisions on the part of the Syrian
government also played an important role in this conflict. Still, this
case represents a cautionary tale of how poor governance and climate
change can exacerbate a natural phenomenon into a crisis, pitting the
world\'s superpowers against one another. There is also evidence that
early investment in mitigation can save money in the long run. A 2019
report concluded that \$1.8 trillion in mitigation investment by 2030
concentrated in just five selective areas would yield \$7.1 trillion in
benefits.38 An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report estimates
that the impact to just 22 economic sectors in the United States would
cost about an additional \$224 billion per year by 2090 if we maintain
no mitigation action to address climate change. The drought that led to
the mass migrations in Darfur in the Sudan is regarded largely as
triggering the first mass migrations that can be linked to climate
change.39 Current violent conflicts, such as in Syria and Yemen, have
been linked by several scholars to prolonged water scarcity.40 Climate
change exacerbated severe drought in the Fertile Crescent, driving
farmers to move to the cities, and helped trigger uprisings that
eventually led to the Syrian civil war.41,42 To be sure, poor decisions
on the part of the Syrian government also played an important role in
this conflict. Still, this case represents a cautionary tale of how poor
governance and climate change can exacerbate a natural phenomenon into a
crisis, pitting the world\'s superpowers against one another. While
conflicts are often attributed to a combination of different causes, it
is becoming more evident that future water insecurity will play a
greater role in conflict situations."43 Global warming also impairs the
capability of our military to protect U.S. national interests. For
example, [128 U.S. military bases are currently under threat from rising
sea levels, especially in the Arctic]{.underline}. [Infrastructure, such
as bridges, roads, rail, ports, and aviation structures are required for
DoD to move personnel and equipment in response to disasters as well as
potential conflicts.]{.underline}

#### Sea ice melt magnifies geopolitical frictions in the Arctic -- melting permafrost will increase Russian aggression and China will exploit commercial opportunities for hegemonic gain

Tucker **Hamilton**, 10/21/**22**, American Security Project, "The
Geopolitics of Arctic Warming",
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/geopolitics-of-arctic-warming/,
mm

The Department of Defense conceptualizes climate change as an abstract
security challenge -- a "threat multiplier" that can accelerate,
exacerbate, or set in motion -- but not precipitate -- conflict. [[In
the 2030s and beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[there will be a
paradigm shift]{.mark} that forces policymakers, analysts, and
strategists to also contend with the direct consequences of climate
change on geopolitical positions and the balance of power]{.underline}.
[[Nowhere is this]{.mark} phenomenon [more]{.mark} visible and [imminent
than the Arctic]{.mark} Circle]{.underline}, where retreating ice
shelves will soon modify the fundamental characteristics of regional
geography. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[stands
to]{.mark} both [gain and lose]{.mark} strategic advantages [due to the
melting Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly,
[[ice]{.mark}-[free]{.mark} Arctic [waterways]{.mark}]{.underline} and
coastlines [[will ameliorate]{.mark} the [pressure]{.mark} on Russia [to
expand]{.mark} its frontiers]{.underline} along the Black Sea. Russia's
pursuit of perennial warm-water ports and securing unencumbered access
to global sea lines of communication is an established imperative in
Russian grand strategy extending back to the reign of Peter the Great.
In essence, Russia needs ports that can handle commerce and support
naval power projection without interruption from winter freezes, a
standard most of its ports fail to meet. Indeed, well before Putin
gambled with absorbing Ukraine altogether, he made certain to capture
Crimea and its warm deep-water jewel of Sevastopol. [[Yet]{.mark},
Arctic [climate change imposes greater]{.mark} [liabilities]{.mark} on
Russia's geostrategic position [than it offers]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Particularly, [as Arctic temperatures rise, [Russia's]{.mark} northern
[coastline]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [infrastructure are likely to suffer
destabilizing levels of erosion]{.mark} [from thawing
permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which will compound with rising
tides]{.underline}. Russia's paramount challenge from ice-free Arctic
waters, however, will be the under-protected new flank along its
substantial 15,000 mile northern coastline. Russia was plugging this
security gap with a steady Arctic re-militarization until the Ukraine
war derailed those efforts. Now, Russia is diverting military and
economic resources that could otherwise be going towards polar
fortification and port infrastructure, leaving this front exposed likely
until the far future. Moreover, [[a defrosted Arctic Ocean deprives
Russia's submarine-based nuclear deterrent of concealment]{.mark}
underneath the ice sheets. Accounting for these costs, [climate change
is likely to transform Russia into a less secure state]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [is]{.mark} also **more [likely to overcompensate]{.mark}
for newfound vulnerability [with belligerence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Another challenge]{.mark} posed by the warming Arctic [will be the
emergence of trade routes that empower Chinese]{.mark} commercial
[interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arctic shipping corridors, including
the seasonally traversable Northwest Passage, Northern Sea Route, and
the prospective but currently nonviable Transpolar Sea Route, hold
immense promise for revolutionizing global supply chains. A journey from
Europe to Asia can take 22 days via the Suez Canal versus 10 days
through the Arctic, with the potential to outpace overland Silk Road
rail routes, resulting in appreciable fuel and opportunity cost savings.
Container ships transiting the Panama and Suez Canals must also cap
their cargo tonnage to control how deep they sit in the water, a
limitation that Arctic shipping routes don't have. Not to mention, these
canals are prone to blockages like the Ever Given incident, which cost
the global economy \$60 Billion. However, [the benefits of Arctic trade
mainly accrue to China since these shipping lanes compress the distance
between Asia and Europe without improving upon routes from the U.S. If
warming sufficiently diminishes Arctic ice, then China will enjoy easier
access to European markets.]{.underline} In addition to commercial
earnings, [[China could exploit these new inroads to expand its market
share]{.mark} of European imports and exports, [a maneuver that
would]{.mark} likely [be accompanied by greater influence and
leverage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, raw economic gains are also
readily translatable into military power. [Ultimately, [with its Polar
Silk Road initiative, China intends to]{.mark} take full advantage of
the commercial opportunities afforded by the warming Arctic to
**[further realize its hegemonic ambitions]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Moreover, the U.S. may feel compelled to assert itself in the Arctic in
order to seize its vast rare earth element (REE) deposits, not for the
sake of wealth but because China's multi-decade push to consolidate
control over global REE supply chains leaves the U.S. with few other
options. Indeed, the Department of Defense recently halted the delivery
of F-35s after discovering that an engine subcomponent was being made
with a cobalt and samarium alloy from China. Clearly, for the U.S. to
continue furnishing its armed forces with advanced equipment and
maintain an edge in the military balance of power by extension, it will
need to secure new REE supply chains that are ideally defensible and
closer to home. Like it or not, [geography is a determinant of
security.]{.underline} As warming reshapes the Arctic theatre, American
strategists should also anticipate how this will reshape the priorities,
calculus, and behavior of its adversaries.

#### The risk is high -- Russia has forward-deployed nuclear weapons

[[Fast-melting sea ice]{.underline}]{.mark} [has opened]{.underline} a
potential new Arctic shipping lane across [the North Pole]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} will give powerful nations easier access to the
frozen zone's vast riches --- but [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[sparked fears of]{.mark} [war]{.mark}. [The Arctic Council
predicts]{.mark} that]{.underline}, during the summers, [[sea ice will
be gone by 2040]{.mark} ---]{.underline} [allowing for a]{.underline}
major new seasonal passageway. This [Transpolar Sea Route]{.underline}
(TSR) would be the fastest way to get around the region and could spur a
spike in mining, drilling and trade over the next quarter-century.
[[Territorial stakes are yet to be sorted out]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
US, Russia and six other countries]{.underline} --- Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Norway --- [are jockeying for
claims]{.underline} to the surrounding area's oil, gas and rare-earth
minerals and metals: precious resources needed to power computers,
phones, electric cars and satellites. [China]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[is claiming "near Arctic" status]{.underline} so it, too, can benefit
from the wealth of the region. "Today is a pivotal moment that is going
to reshape the energy market and the supply chain," said Rebekah
Koffler, an intelligence analyst and author of "Putin's Playbook:
Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America." "[[The Arctic is going to be
the future battlefield for economic dominance]{.mark} and]{.underline}
possession of [natural resources]{.underline}." The new passage, which
runs about 2,000 nautical miles and was first crossed in 2012, currently
is navigable only with high-level icebreaker ships. But should melting
ice make it more easily crossable, the TSR would offer lower costs and
delivery times, particularly to Europe and Asia. It is hoped that
tankers and cargo carriers will be able to sail over the top of the
earth using the TSR in summer, saving more travel time than the two main
coastline-hugging waterways that currently link the Arctic to southern
ports. "You could see a ship being sent right over the North Pole as
early as 2035," said Marc Lanteigne, an Arctic researcher in Norway.
"Floating sea ice is still a hazard, but the degree of danger gets lower
and lower each year." But [[the new passage could]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[escalate]{.mark} [tensions between nations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Last month, Russian President Vladimir [Putin said his country will
"knock out]{.underline} the teeth" of [any]{.underline} foreign
[adversary that challenges its]{.underline} sovereignty over any
territory it [claims]{.underline}. While he didn't specifically name the
Arctic, [[Russia is]{.mark}]{.underline} currently [[massing a
formidable array of military weapons in the region]{.underline} ---
[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the Poseidon 2M39, [[a stealth
nuclear-powered torpedo]{.underline}]{.mark} dubbed the "super-weapon."
Days after Putin's comments, President Biden warned that the climate
change could "generate potential conflict in terms of dominating the
Arctic." "The distance between Russia and NATO countries in the Arctic
has been reduced to about 100 miles," added Koffler. "And everyone is
posturing for dominance. The US Army says we're going to dominate the
region, but the Russians have their own strategy. They're screaming that
they're going to be the only non-NATO country in the Arctic Group. And
China has joined the fight. They're trying to tap into the Arctic as a
major shipping route." Until now, commercial shippers from the US,
Canada and western Europe have relied on the Northwest Passage (NWP),
which was opened widely in 2007. The Northern Sea Route (NSR), which
started in 2017, is dominated by Russia. Up for grabs is greater access
to a region that holds 13% of the world's untapped oil and 30% of its
drillable natural gas, according to the US Geological Survey. There's
also an estimated \$1 trillion in metals and minerals, ranging from gold
and silver to beryllium, cadmium and lithium --- all in great demand due
to the explosive growth of personal electronics and electric-battery
cars. While shipping, mining, drilling and fishing rights have been
established along the Arctic coastal waterways for each country, none
have been set for the wider Arctic. And it's led to bitter disputes. In
2015, the Russians told a UN commission that everything is theirs,
including all international waters from the continental shelf to the
North Pole. Greenland has made a similar claim. Canada has rejected
those arguments. Meanwhile, the US and Canada are at odds over who
controls the NWP. In any case, the UN doesn't have the power to decide
who gets what. It says that valid but overlapping stakes must be sorted
out between competing nations. Meanwhile, deposits in the Arctic have
already enriched all Northern nations --- and Russia most of all.
Moscow's offshore drilling along the Yamal Peninsula, which is brimming
with petroleum and natural gas below the seafloor, has delivered the
biggest profits in the region. "[For the Russians, the Arctic is their
lifeblood]{.underline}," said Capt. David "Duke" Snider, a former
Canadian Coast Guard director who now runs Martech Polar Consulting,
which helps ships navigate the Arctic.

#### Arctic conflicts go nuclear -- even limited disputes can quickly spiral out of control

Matthew **Wallin**, 5/12/**25**, American Security Project, "Is the
Arctic Destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a nuclear war?"
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/,
mm

Long gone are the days of "duck and cover" drills and fallout shelters
in America, when the fears of nuclear war were on the minds of most.
[[For decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, cooler heads prevailed, and [[the
U.S. and Russia worked]{.mark} cooperatively [to reduce the risk of
nuclear conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} and decrease the size of their
arsenals. [[By 2022, cooperation began disintegrating as
Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} botched [[invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}
raised serious [concerns]{.mark} [about]{.mark} nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline} and severely hampered the prospects of
future nuclear arms control agreements. With Russia seemingly dismissing
the Trump administration's rather conciliatory efforts to end the war,
there appears to be no end in sight, and Europe is feeling the pressure,
embarking on a massive effort to boost its own defense. [[Amidst these
tensions, melting polar ice is opening Arctic sea lanes]{.mark} to
increased shipping traffic, resource exploration, and military
posturing. NATO's newest members]{.underline}, Finland and Sweden, [are
Arctic nations]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.mark} currently [dominates the
Arctic region]{.mark},]{.underline} holding 53% of its total coastline,
operating the world's biggest icebreaker fleet, and has been upgrading
its Arctic military bases. [[China]{.mark} [is]{.mark} also increasingly
playing a role]{.underline}, [[conducting joint Arctic military
exercises with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and employing an icebreaker
fleet of its own, despite its complete lack of territory in the Arctic
Circle. But **[[is the Arctic]{.mark} destined to be [the most likely
flashpoint for a nuclear war?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Let's look at the
possibilities. Despite being so cold, [the Arctic is no stranger to
military conflict,]{.underline} [holding major strategic value and
serving as a passageway to both the Atlantic and Pacific]{.underline}.
During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic extended into the Arctic
and ships carrying American war supplies to the Soviet Union traversed
the Northern Sea Route. Germany invaded Norway, and the Soviet Union
invaded Finland in the Winter War of 1940. As the Cold War evolved, the
Arctic became a major theater for submarine activity. Today, President
[Trump's insistence on]{.underline} [acquiring]{.underline}
[Greenland]{.underline} "one way or the other" [highlights the growing
importance of the Arctic to the security interests of the United
States]{.underline}. Greenland's geographic location, combined with the
U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space Base in the high north, provides key
"missile warning, missile defense, and space surveillance" capabilities.
[The shortest flight paths for nuclear missiles between the U.S. and
Russia exist over the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}, and the loss of this
base on account of a diplomatic blunder could open a key blind spot in
America's strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss of this base to a
Russian attack aimed at disabling American missile detection
infrastructure is unlikely due to the danger of immediate retaliation
and escalation. Currently, [[the most likely path to]{.mark} a potential
[nuclear exchange in the Arctic would be through a conventional or "gray
zone" Russian attack on a NATO member]{.mark}. [Border skirmishes,
cyber-attacks, airspace incursions, reckless military intercepts, and
support to separatist groups]{.mark}]{.underline} intentionally sit in
the "gray zone" between peace and outright war, but [[could]{.mark}
[ultimately lead to open conflict that escalates to nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Conceivably, a gray zone or overt
attack on other Greelandic infrastructure, or an information operations
campaign aimed at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not
outside of the realm of possibility. With NATO's addition of Sweden and,
more importantly, Finland---which shares a 1,343 km border with
Russia---there is increased opportunity that a NATO Arctic state could
be attacked. Highlighting this risk, American forces in Alaska recently
staged a drill in which hundreds of troops were flown to Finland to
defend against a mock Russian invasion. Yet rather than an overt
invasion of a NATO member, [Russia is far more likely test the waters by
conducting provocative and destabilizing small-scale gray zone
activities]{.underline}. The disastrous results of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about its ability to achieve
its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear armed country, let alone
a large NATO ally, making a direct attack unlikely. It is not entirely
clear where the red line on gray zone activities would be for Finland or
what would trigger an Article 5 collective defense declaration short of
a direct attack across the border. Though the threat of American nuclear
weapons has long-served to deter a Russian attack on the European NATO
members, President Trump's many public pronouncements expressing doubt
about his willingness to defend a NATO member that comes under attack
has shaken confidence in Europe about America's commitment. As a result,
France and the UK are considering expanding their arsenals, signifying
an increased reliance on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for
the defense of Arctic NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it
wants to decommission its current warheads as it brings replacements
online, potentially doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is
simultaneously upgrading an airbase closer to the German border to be
able to host nuclear weapons. The UK, which has been historically
dependent on the U.S. for its nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning
that dependence, and may seek other options to assure an effective and
reliable deterrent. This could foretell a new nuclear arms race. The
upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the last remaining
strategic nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, portends a
period of nuclear proliferation that could echo the nuclear arms
buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, China, which has been operating in
the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid nuclear buildup in an
effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by 2035. China has
consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral nuclear arms
reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its comparatively much
smaller nuclear arsenal. [[Navigation issues]{.mark} in the Arctic could
[also lead to military escalations reaching the nuclear
level]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The Global Navigation Satellite
System]{.underline} (GNSS), which includes satellite constellations like
the American GPS system or Russian GLONASS, [sees decreased reliability
and accuracy in the Arctic.]{.underline} The reasons for this are
abundant, like the orbital inclination of the satellites themselves and
ionospheric interference. With increased incidents of Russian GNSS
jamming in Europe, it's conceivable that Russia may employ similar
tactics in the Arctic, including spoofing, for the purpose of disruption
or causing navigational errors to trigger an exploitable international
incident. [[Military or civilian vessels straying into Russian territory
could be captured]{.underline},]{.mark} their cargoes seized, or crews
held hostage for the purpose of conducting hostage diplomacy.
**[[Resolving such a confrontation military could quickly spiral out of
control.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[As the impacts of climate change become increasingly severe, the Arctic

and subsequent ice loss. The Arctic serves as a crucial component of the
Earth's climate system]{.underline}, and its deterioration poses
substantial risks not only to local ecosystems but also to global
weather patterns, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. In this
context, [[geoengineering presents]{.mark} itself as [a]{.mark}
potentially [viable]{.mark}, albeit]{.underline} contentious, [[approach
to]{.mark} mitigate the ongoing environmental crisis by [refreezing the
Arctic and stabilizing]{.mark} the [weather
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The necessity of geoengineering
arises from the stark reality that [conventional mitigation
strategies]{.mark}, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
[are]{.mark} proving [insufficient in reversing]{.mark} the trajectory
[of Arctic ice melt]{.mark}. Despite global efforts to curtail
emissions, the Arctic has warmed at a rate twice that of the global
average, leading to a vicious cycle of ice-albedo feedback]{.underline}.
As ice melts, it exposes darker ocean waters that absorb more sunlight,
further accelerating warming. [This feedback loop not only diminishes
the Arctic ice cover but also disrupts the polar jet stream, which
governs weather patterns across the Northern Hemisphere. The
destabilization of the jet stream has been linked to extreme weather
events]{.underline}, such as prolonged cold spells in Europe and North
America and unprecedented heatwaves in regions unaccustomed to such
conditions. Thus, [the stakes are high, and the window for effective
action is narrowing]{.underline}. Geoengineering, specifically [[Solar
Radiation Management]{.underline}]{.mark} (SRM), [[offers a direct
method to counteract]{.mark} the [warming]{.mark} trend [by
reflecting]{.mark} a fraction of the incoming [solar radiation back into
space]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the most promising SRM techniques is
Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), which involves dispersing fine
particles, such as sulphate aerosols, into the stratosphere to mimic the
cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Historical data from volcanic
events, such as the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, demonstrates
that such an intervention can lead to a measurable decrease in global
temperatures. By strategically deploying SAI, we can achieve localised
cooling in the Arctic, thereby slowing or even reversing the ice melt.
The refreezing of the Arctic would restore the albedo effect,
potentially halting the destabilisation of the polar jet stream and
reestablishing more stable weather patterns across the Northern
Hemisphere. Critics of geoengineering often cite concerns about
unintended consequences, such as disruptions to regional climates,
precipitation patterns, or the potential for geopolitical conflicts
arising from the uneven distribution of benefits and risks. While these
concerns are valid, they must be weighed against the severe and certain
consequences of inaction. The deployment of geoengineering, particularly
SRM, does not preclude the need for continued emissions reductions and
other climate adaptation strategies. Instead, it should be viewed as a
complementary tool that can buy time for these longer-term solutions to
take effect. Moreover, [[advances in modelling and monitoring
technologies enable us to]{.mark} design and [implement]{.mark}
geoengineering [interventions]{.mark} [with]{.mark} a level of
[precision]{.mark} that was previously unattainable. [These
technologies]{.mark} [allow]{.mark} for [real-time feedback and
adjustment]{.mark} of the intervention, [thereby]{.mark}
[minimizing]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark} of unintended
consequences]{.underline}. The ethical implications of geoengineering,
particularly issues related to consent and governance, must be addressed
through international cooperation and transparent decision-making
processes. The establishment of a global framework for the governance of
geoengineering is imperative to ensure that the technology is deployed
responsibly and equitably. [The deployment of geoengineering to refreeze
the Arctic]{.underline} and stabilize the weather system in the Northern
Hemisphere [is not only a feasible engineering solution but also an
ethical imperative given **the existential threat** posed by unchecked
climate change]{.underline}. [The Arctic region is a linchpin in the
global climate system]{.underline}, and its preservation is crucial for
maintaining the stability of weather patterns that billions of people
rely on for their livelihoods. [While geoengineering is not without its
risks, the risks of inaction are far greater]{.underline}. Therefore, it
is incumbent upon the global scientific and political communities to
seriously consider and develop geoengineering as part of a comprehensive
strategy to combat climate change. The urgency of the situation demands
bold and innovative solutions, and geoengineering offers a pathway to
avert the worst consequences of a rapidly warming world.

#### Specifically, Marine Cloud Brightening is sufficient to restore Arctic sea ice

[The world\'s response to the growing climate crisis has been
inadequate]{.underline}. Progress in mitigation has not been made fast
enough. [Experts say that the [nations]{.mark} of the world [are not on
track to]{.mark}]{.underline} meet even the modest targets set in the
Paris Accord to [[limit warming to 2 °C.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Additionally, current efforts will not be enough to prevent catastrophic
damage to the climate, peoples and economies of the world. [[It is time
to consider steps]{.mark} [that]{.mark} may [provide additional
time]{.mark} to develop more serious mitigation efforts and stretch out
the cost of mitigation]{.underline}. Traditional geo-engineering
approaches, such as Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI),44 are by
design large-scale because they seek to offset the regional warming
caused by greenhouse gases emissions. Once started, such interventions
are difficult to stop because the injected aerosols stay in the
stratosphere for years. If there are unintended consequences, models
show that there is often a rebound and overshoot in temperature, called
a termination effect. [[There are emerging]{.mark} non-traditional
[technological]{.mark} [solutions]{.mark} [that can mitigate]{.mark} the
damage caused by global [warming]{.mark} [and]{.mark} also
[diffuse]{.mark} [tensions]{.mark} that threaten U.S. national security.
One class of these technologies is Arctic Sea Ice
Restoration]{.underline} (ASIR) that seeks to increase the reflectivity
of sea ice during the summer months to prevent ice melt.45 It is local
by design and therefore its impact is smaller and easier to control.
[[The goal]{.mark} of ASIR \[Arctic Sea Ice Restoration\] [is to break
the sea ice reflectivity feedback loop]{.mark} and take advantage of the
natural Arctic amplification to mitigate warming over a larger
region.]{.underline} The aim is to slow global warming. [[These]{.mark}
technological [solutions have no demonstrated unintended consequences
and are easily reversible]{.mark}]{.underline}. To date, no major
deployments of any geoengineering approach have been attempted.
[[Several small demonstration projects]{.mark}, in laboratories or
small-scale deployments, [have been carried out along with]{.mark} some
[modeling efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Considerably more research,
modeling and engineering studies are needed before these many different
geoengineering approaches can be seriously considered for full scale
deployment. Three ASIR approaches that have been proposed to date and
are presented below. Since these approaches are local, they are easily
reversible and have no known termination effects. Scientist Leslie Field
and colleagues46 have proposed a localized Arctic sea ice reflectivity
restoration technology whose aim is to restore the Arctic ice\'s natural
function of reflecting sunlight and thereby reducing warming of the
ocean by reflecting solar radiation. The concept is to increase the
reflectivity of young ice by applying a thin layer of reflective hollow
silica-glass microspheres onto the surface of the ice. This treatment
would increase the reflectivity of ice by about 50 percent, reducing the
absorption of solar radiation that heats the ocean and causes more ice
loss. The materials used in the treatment are reported to be nontoxic,
consisting of silica (the primary material in sand, and most rocks).
Biotoxicological testing to date, has shown no adverse impact on
wildlife. A climate modeling study, designed to simulate the potential
impact of the reflectivity modification scheme over the entire Arctic
Ocean showed that yearly application of the material on the Arctic sea
ice over the period 2000--2040 will cause ice volume to increase from
0.5 percent to 1 percent per year, with increased ice thickness of 20 cm
to 1 m. The climate modeling also shows that a large part of the Arctic
sees temperatures decreasing by more than 1.5 °C after application.47 An
Arctic-wide deployment, however, is simply a base case, but not a
realistic scenario for deployment. Strategies for a targeted deployment
of these microspheres in smaller areas, for example in the Fram
Strait,48 through which much ice export has been seen in the past
several decades, may be a key leverage point for ice restoration. The
total cost of deployment could range from \$1-5 billion per year while
potentially averting trillions of dollars of climate-change-induced
damages. Results from the modeling and the field work are promising, but
more and larger field and modeling tests are required to understand
fully the effects and consequences of this technique. Another ASIR
approach has been proposed by Steven Desch and colleagues. Wind-powered
pumps would pump ocean water from underneath the ice to the top surface
during the Arctic winter.49 The water would freeze, delaying or reducing
the ice melt during the summer and, over time, could restore some of the
ice pack to its original thickness and extent. Theoretically, the
additional ice would decrease Arctic amplification and lessen the
detrimental effects that were discussed earlier. The concept has
conceptually developed a system that could increase the thickness of the
ice by about 1 m over the course of an Arctic winter, representing about
a 70 percent thickening of the ice. The scientists estimated that a
system that could cover 10 percent of the Arctic Ocean spread over ten
years would require one million devices annually and cost about \$50
billion per year. To date this concept has been tested in laboratory
setting and numerical simulations have been conducted.50 The wind-driven
pumps are conceptual at this point and much engineering work is required
to ensure that the devices would survive the harsh Arctic winter. This
method is not as mature as the previous approach. A third technology,
called [[Marine Cloud Brightening]{.underline}]{.mark} (MCB), [sp[rays
nanoscale condensation nuclei into the marine boundary
layer]{.mark}]{.underline} (\<1000 meters in altitude) [[to make
existing clouds brighter]{.mark}. Such brightening has the potential to
**keep large portions of the Arctic cooler**.]{.underline} More research
is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of such an approach as well as the
potential for unintended consequences. [[A prototype]{.mark} MCB
experiment [was carried out]{.mark} recently [in Australia]{.mark} to
develop a technique that could potentially delay coral bleaching in the
waters of the Great Barrier Reef]{.underline}.51 [[The costs]{.mark} of
large-scale deployments of any ice restoration approach
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} difficult to predict accurately at present.
Estimates of [[tens of billions]{.mark} of dollars
[annually]{.mark}]{.underline}, or roughly 0.1percent of GWP, have been
suggested. [While such costs are large, the avoidance of the staggering
costs of damages due to global warming must be considered]{.underline}.
Evaluating only the cost of [[climate-related
disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is estimated that
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} just [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} recent
[[two-year period]{.mark},]{.underline} 2016 through 2018, such
disasters [[cost]{.mark} the world [\$650 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In North America alone, those costs were estimated to be \$415
billion.52 Munich Re, the world\'s largest reinsurance firm, blamed
climate change for \$24 billion of losses in the California
wildfires.53,54 [[Cost estimates]{.mark} for climate change-related
disasters and associated infrastructure, agricultural, economic and
human health impacts [by 2040 are staggering]{.mark}. In just two
decades from now, these costs have been estimated to be \$54 trillion
world-wide]{.underline}. This staggering cost projection suggests that
[timely and assertive restoration approaches]{.underline}, if proven
safe and subject to appropriate governance[, could be an effective tool
to fight global warming]{.underline} while human societies seek to
reduce greenhouse gases emissions. While Arctic ice restoration ideas
are promising, much more research is needed to determine the feasibility
and consequences of these approaches. Testing needs to be phased up to
large-scale field experiments in the Arctic where conditions are harsh.
Modeling using the most recent global and regional Global Climate Models
are needed to assess the predicted effects of these techniques on global
and local climate and weather to identify the most effective locations
for possible application. While recently there have been some modeling
efforts focused on the effects of large-scale geo-engineering
approaches, these lack sufficient funding for needed research and
development. [[We propose that the United States take a strong
leadership position in addressing]{.mark} Arctic climate issues and the
possibility of [ice restoration]{.mark}]{.underline}. We also propose
that the United States establish a new research and development (R&D)
initiative inspired by NOAA\'s National Hurricane Center (NHC). Here
both intramural and extramural scientists would perform extensive
modeling and monitoring research, and engineers would develop mechanisms
to deal with the destructive forces of hurricanes. [This new R&D
initiative would be focused on Arctic climate restoration and might be
called, "National Arctic Ice Restoration Initiative]{.underline}"
(NAIRI). NAIRI would be a multiagency coordinated effort comprised of
NSF, NASA, NOAA, DoE and DoD earth science and relevant allied programs
associated with climate change and climate modeling. Annual funding for
NAIRI would be at 2020 levels of appropriate budgets to the above
agencies augmented by an aggregated total of \$1 billion annually.
Augmented funds would be apportioned through NAIRI among participating
agencies and devoted to R&D into methodologies and demonstration
projects designed to restore Arctic ice. NAIRI also would place
significant emphasis and resources on updating and modernizing climate
models incorporating a more accurate representation of the contribution
of Arctic climate changes and Arctic ice representation in global
warming models, thus improving prediction accuracy and capabilities.
NAIRI would solicit and select concepts for research and projects from
government, academic, and industry organizations in keeping with the
standard practices currently used by NASA and other agencies. To address
the threats of unacceptable climate change, augmented by the degradation
and deterioration of Arctic ecosystems[, NAIRI would improve scientific
knowledge and develop techniques to restore the Arctic to its historic
norms.]{.underline} The following represent some obvious areas for
needed advancements in scientific understanding: • Study Arctic ice
characteristics and potential for reversing or slowing ice loss •
Develop a better understanding of the coupling between ice, atmosphere
and ocean dynamics, including ocean currents and weather patterns •
Study the deterioration pathways for Tundra vegetation and methane
release • Augment satellite, aircraft and surface monitoring of the
Arctic region. The region is particularly difficult to access and
monitor due to its accessibility for in situ measurements and extreme
latitude. Monitoring should include measurements of greenhouse gases as
well as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (which deplete ozone and are strong
greenhouse gases). Given the predicted deleterious impacts of global
warming and associated climate changes, [NAIRI would provide a
coordinated and rigorous U.S. national multi-agency R&D effort to
understand both the potential risks and benefits associated with
proposed climate intervention approaches]{.underline}. It is important
that the nation, and the world, have a variety of tools to use to avoid
the disastrous impacts of global warming on humans and all ecosystems.
It is equally important that the pros and cons of proposed ASIR
approaches are fully understood. Only through R&D investments can such
understanding be gained. Accordingly, we propose that NAIRI also invest
in efforts designed to actively geoengineer climate restoration through
a variety of potential approaches. Approaches for restoration would be
selected through soli and could include, but not be limited to the
approaches outlined earlier. [The destabilizing effect of global climate
change threatens national security, both in the United States and
globally]{.underline}. The scale and severity of these issues dictate
that we do what we can to stop, or at least slow down, these climate
changes. [[Arctic sea ice restoration represents a way of buying
time]{.mark} and restoring some stability to the Arctic region. As the
world has learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, [fast and effective
intervention is essentia]{.mark}l. Delaying such action results in
exponentially higher costs both economically and in loss of human life
and suffering]{.underline}. [Inaction with respect to slowing down the
rate of global warming will have similarly devastating consequences in
decades to come if action is not taken now]{.underline}.

#### The US has the capacity and technical ability to implement successful Marine Cloud Brightening in the Arctic

Once denounced by former United States (US) Vice President Al Gore as
"delusional in the extreme", [solar geoengineering is receiving greater
attention from American scientists and policymakers]{.underline}.
Increasingly pessimistic as to the prospects of existing strategies for
addressing climate change and mindful of America's acute vulnerability
to its effects, these voices are challenging taboos by exploring
alternative solutions to global warming. [[Solar
geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark} (SG) [is a category of climate
interventions which [would mask the effects of]{.mark} global [warming
by reflecting]{.mark} incoming [solar
radiation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Amongst these interventions,
the technology attracting the most attention is stratospheric aerosol
injections]{.underline} (SAI), which mimic the cooling impact of
volcanoes by injecting reflective aerosol particles into the
stratosphere. In recent years, [however, [marine cloud
brightening]{.mark}]{.underline} (MCB) [[has emerged as a credible
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark} to SAI (increasingly considered a blunt
and unwieldy environmental tool). [Deployed at scale, MCB would alter
the energy balance of Earth by seeding seawater aerosol above the ocean
to produce more reflective clouds.]{.underline} To its critics, SG is an
unhelpful distraction from climate mitigation which risks unintended and
uneven global effects and a dangerous securitisation of the environment.
However, in light of the continued failure of climate mitigation and
America's tradition of scientific leadership and self-professed
"exceptionalism", this article explores the circumstances in which the
US would deploy MCB to mask the impact of global warming in the coming
decades. Whilst MCB appears practically feasible for a state with
America's resources, it is unclear whether there will be sufficient
domestic support for its deployment, and the response of the
international community is contingent upon its perceived impacts which
are presently difficult to predict. This article identifies three
conditions for a sustained US deployment of MCB and considers the
circumstances in which they may each be met, outlined in turn below. The
first condition to the [[US deployment of MCB]{.mark} is the emergence
of a consensus that it [could reduce US exposure to climate
change]{.mark} more [quickly]{.mark} and at a lower cost than
conventional mitigation or adaptation]{.underline}. Because the debate
on SG has outpaced practical research on the subject, evaluations of
SG's environmental impact and technical feasibility are usually premised
upon the climate impact of historic volcanic eruptions, with the cooling
effect of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo serving as the preeminent
case-study for SAI. Natural analogues for MCB are harder to find, but
the warming impact of reduced maritime emissions since 2020 has helped
demonstrate the principle that [increasing cloud-cover over the ocean
reduces global temperatures by reflecting solar radiation]{.underline}.
Although further research on MCB is required, existing research
identifies four conclusions relevant to US assessment of its
feasibility. [[Applied at scale]{.underline}]{.mark}, SG (including
[[MCB]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[would]{.mark} materially [reduce the
temperature]{.mark} of Earth **[within months of
deployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [overcoming the collective action
problems of climate mitigation without the time-lag inherent to
adaptation]{.underline}. However, most studies also indicate that SG
could interfere with Earth's hydrological cycles, reducing net global
rainfall while increasing the frequency of heavy precipitation events.
Depending on where these effects were experienced, SG could therefore
exacerbate the western states' vulnerability to droughts, or increase
the frequency of severe flooding in the south-east of the country.
Further, since SG does nothing to reduce the concentration of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, the abrupt cessation of SG without the
development of negative emissions technology would trigger a
"termination effect" as Earth's energy balance returns to pre-deployment
levels. SG would therefore pose an increasing security threat until
carbon capture reduces the concentration of atmospheric GHGs, which may
take many decades. At the outset, therefore, SG therefore provides US
policymakers with an imperfect and incomplete solution to global
warming. [[MCB]{.mark} has several potential advantages]{.underline}
over other forms of SG. Because the lifespan of seawater aerosol is
measured in days, MCB [deployment [could be ceased without any material
time-lag]{.mark}, increasing America's ability to control the
intervention]{.underline}. This contrasts with SAI, where sulphur
particles would remain in the stratosphere for around two years from
release. Further, whereas the global impact of SAI prevents localized
deployment, [[MCB]{.mark} [could]{.mark} theoretically [be applied
forensically]{.mark} in vulnerable regions [to prevent]{.mark} the
occurrence of [a climate tipping point]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whilst
localized deployment may not materially reduce global temperature
increases, [an MCB intervention to reduce ice melt [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [could slow sea level
rises]{.underline} currently threatening the coastlines of Florida, New
York and Louisiana in particular. Finally, research has suggested that
MCB deployments could be used to disrupt the formation of cyclones. This
could, in theory, mitigate against the risk of Atlantic hurricanes,
which have cost the US economy USD 1.3 trillion since 1980. MCB
therefore potentially provides a greater degree of controllability than
other SG interventions, and may allow US policymakers to tailor the
deployment to meet the country's evolving vulnerabilities. The
deployment of MCB may be relatively straightforward from a technical
perspective. As noted by Salter [[the most]{.mark} [appropriate]{.mark}
[delivery mechanism]{.mark} for MCB [would be sea vessels
spraying]{.mark} into the air a plume of fine [saltwater]{.mark} [to
augment]{.mark} and whiten [marine clouds]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although
there remains some doubt as to the preferred size and quantity of these
particles, nascent research from April 2024 indicates that this spray
could be produced by a form of micro-fabrication lithography, which
creates droplets by forcing saltwater through tiny-nozzled sprayers.
[[These sprayers could be mounted onto conventional maritime
shipping]{.underline}]{.mark} or bespoke unmanned
[[vessels]{.underline}]{.mark} powered by wind-propelled "Flettner
rotors". Calculations of the efficacy of these sprayers are usually
premised upon the achievement of a radiative forcing sufficient to
offset a doubling of atmospheric Co2, which would reduce global
temperatures by 1.5-3°C. Studies suggest that this effect could be
achieved by thousands of sprayers attached to 2,000 vessels navigating
the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with 10 kilometre spacing[. [The
estimated]{.underline}]{.mark} [annual [cost]{.mark} of
this]{.underline} scale of MCB [deployment [ranges]{.mark}
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} USD [[5 billion]{.underline}]{.mark} (McNutt,
2015) [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} USD [[40 billion]{.underline}]{.mark} --
roughly equivalent to the estimated annual cost of SAI deployment.
Despite the proliferation of American billionaire advocates of SG,
[[this cost]{.underline}]{.mark} likely places MCB beyond the reach of
private individuals. However, it [[constitutes]{.mark} a fraction of
total US government expenditure]{.underline} in 2023 (USD 6.13 trillion)
[and [less than 5% of the America's annual defence budget]{.mark}. Even
[as an ongoing cost, it is]{.mark} also [vastly smaller than the US's
estimated financial exposure to]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark} in the
next 50 years]{.underline} (USD 14.5 trillion), and at least 1,000 times
cheaper than the estimated cost of carbon dioxide removal required to
achieve the same cooling effect. Significantly, it is also a fraction of
the USD 332 billion of oil and gas revenue earned by the US in 2022,
which would need to plummet if the country's response to climate change
was limited solely to climate mitigation. Although suggestions of the
involvement of the military in SG deployment has alarmed some critics,
[[the US Navy]{.mark} likely [has significant capacity to coordinate and
deploy MCB]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, with open access to the
world's two largest oceans and a huge military-industrial complex, [[the
US is well-positioned geographically and structurally to undertake the
intervention]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, whilst further research on
MCB is required, [feasibility alone is unlikely to be a barrier to
deployment, which may be significantly more affordable than alternative
responses to climate change]{.underline}. The second condition to the US
deployment of MCB is a sufficient level of domestic support for the
intervention. Of course, popular support is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for the making of policy, even in representative
democracies. Nevertheless, empirical studies reveal that public opinion
strongly influences policy, especially where the salience of an issue is
high, and politicians are often responsive to public demands on climate
change. In the case of MCB, the unprecedented nature of the deployment,
together with its significant financial cost, is likely to heighten the
salience of the public debate. Further, because MCB would need to be
maintained in perpetuity until the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs
can be reduced, its deployment would likely span several decades and
need to survive repeated swings between Republican and Democratic
administrations. Authorising the deployment of MCB would also likely
require a filibuster-proof majority in the US Senate. Taken together,
these factors indicate that sustained MCB deployment by the US would
require a significant coalition of bipartisan support. In a period of
intense political polarisation, the achievement of a consensus over an
issue as potentially divisive as SG appears challenging. Positions on
climate are amongst the strongest indicators of political identity in
the US which, along with guns and abortion, reflect "two Americas
divided along ideological lines". Indeed, a significant proportion of
Republicans currently deny the very existence of anthropogenic climate
change -- usually considered a pre-requisite to support for SG.
Moreover, since climate change is a subtle phenomenon to observe in
abstract, populations rely upon second-hand information to understand
its causes and effects. Given that the country's political polarisation
is increasingly reflected in bifurcated news consumption, the very
existence of support for SG from one party could feed suspicion from the
other. Although public awareness of SG within the US is currently low
two factors may complicate this model of climate polarisation. Firstly,
"left/right" polarisation may be less important in determining views on
SG than a divide between "Prometheans" confident of humanity's ability
to control nature and "Soterians" who are instinctively suspicious of
"unnatural technological solutions and the hubris of mastery projects".
In this political environment, conservative Republicans doubtful of
mankind's contribution towards climate change may form an unlikely
coalition with environmental activists who view SG as a dangerous
distraction from climate change mitigation. Conversely, pragmatic
Democrats eager to "buy time" for long-term climate solutions may align
with corporatist Republicans who see in SG an opportunity to maintain
existing economic structures. Indeed, a coalition in support of MCB
deployment could include such diverse voices as former Republican House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who made the conservative case for SG deployment
in 2008, and Democratic President Joe Biden, who authorized a report on
SG in 2022. It is therefore possible that the politics of SG may
transcend traditional political polarisation, enabling a wider potential
coalition of support for MCB deployment. Public support for SG may
evolve considerably as the impacts of climate change are felt throughout
the US. Significantly, while studies suggest that the risks from climate
change are highly heterogenous across the US, Republican-dominated
states such as Florida, Louisiana and Texas are amongst the most
vulnerable to global warming in the coming decades. America's wealth
will, of course, permit higher degrees of adaptation than is available
in poorer countries. However, climate change will inevitably increase
social and economic stresses across the south of the US, particularly
amongst non-college educated voters who increasingly dominate the
Republican coalition. Growing internal and external climate migration
northwards could also significantly increase the salience of the climate
debate in regions less directly impacted by global warming. If these
developments contribute towards a heightened threat appraisal of climate
change, protection motivation theory suggests that individuals will be
more likely to support SG. Further, in the coming years, SG may be seen
as a more palatable alternative to a dramatic programme of
decarbonisation which may more directly impact day-to-day life. However,
whilst stresses caused by extreme weather may increase climate risk
perception in the US, widespread suspicion of central government and
rejection of scientific authority may limit support for MCB deployment.
A pathway to bipartisan support for MCB therefore exists, but is
contingent upon a major shift in existing dynamics of climate policy.
The third and final condition to US deployment of MCB is the existence
of a degree of support from the international community. This is not
because the implementation costs of MCB require burden-sharing with
other states: as we have seen, the US could likely deploy MCB for a
fraction of its defence budget. Nor is it because there are significant
legal barriers to the US's unilateral deployment of MCB. [Emerging
scholarship has persuasively demonstrated that SG deployment likely
falls outside of existing international treaties and customary law, and
the US could use its permanent seat on the United Nations Security
Council to veto any resolution prohibiting MCB]{.underline}. Instead,
MCB deployment would likely require some international support because,
unlike other forms of SG such as SAI (which could be deployed from
within the US itself), MCB requires the deployment of thousands of
unmanned vessels across international waters, making it acutely
vulnerable to attack. Although scholars of international relations are
underrepresented in the SG debate, observers have noted the potential
for the unilateral deployment to heighten tensions between countries, or
even spark war. Conversely, other scholars have suggested that SG could
allow for minilateral cooperation between states with similar climate
vulnerabilities. In either case, the international response to an
American MCB deployment would likely depend on its perceived impact upon
local environments around the world. If, as a number of studies suggest,
MCB reduces precipitation in South America or Africa, it may generate
coalitions opposing the intervention who may resort to extreme measures
if their concerns are not addressed. On the other hand, if MCB reduces
the frequency of heatwaves in China or India, the intervention may
receive tacit support from those states. Crucially, however, uncertainty
about causation could fuel accusations of responsibility for climate
disasters regardless of whether they were in fact caused by MCB. [[Given
the quasi-hegemonic power of the US military,]{.mark} it is arguable
that [an MCB deployment could]{.mark} initially [be]{.mark} [protected
by the US without international]{.mark} [partners]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, the continued protection of 2,000 unmanned vessels across a
region spanning 50% of Earth's oceans would likely pose an unprecedented
logistical challenge to a naval power already stretched between
competing interests the Middle East, Asia and Europe. Sinking a Flettner
rotor ship would be within the capabilities of most international
militaries and many non-state actors, who may be able to disguise their
actions or deny responsibility. Since the ships are expected to be
unmanned, the question of defending MCB vessels or punishing
interference would also test normative standards of the use of force and
require US policymakers to confront difficult pathways to escalation.
Continuously defending these assets from opposing states or non-state
actors presents a profound challenge which may fundamentally change the
cost assessment of the MCB deployment. [[Support from traditional
allies]{.mark} such as the UK [may be sufficient to protect a more
limited MCB deployment confined]{.mark}, for example, [to the Arctic
Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, to sustain a prolonged deployment in
the Pacific, the US would likely need to demonstrate responsible
governance of the intervention to third powers such as China and India.
This could involve, for example, the establishment of an independent
authority to assess the global impact of MCB and make recommendations on
the location and intensity of deployment. In canvassing international
support for MCB, the US may also seek to deploy MCB's potential
secondary function of MCB to prevent to disrupt cyclones off the coasts
of vulnerable states. Successful deployment for these purposes would,
however, accelerate attempts by other states to generate an independent
MCB capability, threatening America's ability to control the climate
unilaterally. As a result, the sustained deployment of MCB appears
fraught with uncertainty and risk on the world stage, and may only prove
possible if the US is willing to compromise a degree of its control over
the technology in order to achieve international support.

### Arctic Ice Melt -- Happening Now

#### The arctic is continually shrinking -- the arctic is at an all-time low, and will only keep shrinking absent change

[[Arctic sea ice retreated to near-historic lows in]{.mark} the
[Northern Hemisphere]{.mark} this summer, likely melting to its minimum
extent for the year on Sept.11, 2024**, according to researchers at NASA
and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).** The decline
continues the decades-long trend of shrinking and thinning ice cover in
the Arctic Ocean. The [amount of frozen seawater in]{.mark} the [Arctic
fluctuates during the year as]{.mark} the [ice thaws and regrows between
seasons]{.mark}. Scientists chart these swings to construct a picture of
how the Arctic responds over time to rising air and sea temperatures and
longer melting seasons**. [Over]{.mark} the [past 46 years,
satellite]{.mark}s have [observed persistent trends of more melting in
the summer and less ice formation in winter.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Tracking sea ice changes in real time has revealed wide-ranging impacts,
from losses and changes in polar wildlife habitat to impacts on local
communities in the Arctic and international trade routes. This year,
Arctic sea ice shrank to a minimal extent of 1.65 million square miles
(4.28 million square kilometers). That's about 750,000 square miles
(1.94 million square kilometers) below the 1981 to 2010 end-of-summer
average of 2.4 million square miles (6.22 million square kilometers).
The difference in ice cover spans an area larger than the state of
Alaska. Sea ice extent is defined as the total area of the ocean with at
least 15% ice concentration. [**This year's minimum remained above the
all-time low of 1.31 million square miles (3.39 million square
kilometers) set in September 2012.** [While sea ice coverage can
fluctuate from year to year]{.mark}, it [has trended downward
since]{.mark} the start of the satellite record for ice in the [late
1970s]{.mark}. **[Since then]{.mark}, the [loss of sea ice has
been]{.mark} about [30,000 square miles]{.mark} (77,800 square
kilometers) [per year]{.mark}**, according to NSIDC.]{.underline}
Scientists currently measure sea ice extent using data from passive
microwave sensors aboard satellites in the Defense Meteorological
Satellite Program, with additional historical data from the Nimbus-7
satellite, jointly operated by NASA and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). [[Sea ice is not only shrinking, it's
getting **younger**]{.mark}**, noted Nathan Kurtz, lab chief of NASA's
Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at the agency's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.** **"Today, the** overwhelming majority
of [ice in]{.mark} the [Arctic Ocean is **thinner, first-year
ice**]{.mark}**, [which is less able to survive]{.mark} the [warmer
months]{.mark}. There is far, far less ice that is three years or older
now," Kurtz said.** Ice thickness measurements collected with spaceborne
altimeters, including NASA's ICESat and ICESat-2 satellites, have found
that much of [the oldest, thickest ice has already been
lost]{.mark}.]{.underline} New research out of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Southern California shows that in the central Arctic, away
from the coasts, fall sea ice now hovers around 4.2 feet (1.3 meters)
thick, down from a peak of 8.8 feet (2.7 meters) in 1980. Sea ice in the
southern polar regions of the planet was also low in 2024. Around
Antarctica, scientists are tracking near record-low sea ice at a time
when it should have been growing extensively during the Southern
Hemisphere's darkest and coldest months. Ice around the continent is on
track to be just over 6.6 million square miles (16.96 million square
kilometers). The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.22
million square miles (18.71 million square kilometers). The meager
growth so far in 2024 prolongs a recent downward trend. Prior to 2014,
sea ice in the Antarctic was increasing slightly by about 1% per decade.
Following a spike in 2014, ice growth has fallen dramatically.
Scientists are working to understand the cause of this reversal. The
recurring loss hints at a long-term shift in conditions in the Southern
Ocean, likely resulting from global climate change. "While changes in
sea ice have been dramatic in the Arctic over several decades, Antarctic
sea ice was relatively stable. But that has changed," said Walt Meier, a
sea ice scientist at NSIDC. "It appears that global warming has come to
the Southern Ocean." [In both the Arctic and Antarctic, **[ice loss
compounds ice loss]{.mark}**. This is due to the fact that while bright
sea ice reflects most of the Sun's energy back to space, open ocean
water absorbs 90% of it. [With more of the ocean exposed to sunlight,
water temperatures rise, further delaying sea ice growth.]{.mark} This
cycle of reinforced warming is called ice-albedo feedback. **Overall,
[the loss of sea ice increases heat in the Arctic, where temperatures
have risen about four times the global average]{.mark}, Kurtz
said.**]{.underline}

#### Soaring global temperatures weaken the cryosphere- this produces a positive feedback loop for climate change. 

**Copernicus '24 [\[]{.underline}**April 22, Copernicus is the Earth
observation component of the European Union's Space programme. It has a
core mission centered around providing information to help
decision-making and improve the quality of life for European citizens
and beyond, Copernicus, "Climate Indicators: Cryosphere",
<https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-indicators/cryosphere>\] JM

The term cryosphere derives from the Greek word kryo for cold and
encompasses all the parts of the Earth system where water is in solid
form, including ice sheets, ice shelves, glaciers, snow cover,
permafrost (frozen ground), sea ice, and river and lake ice. [**[The
cryosphere exerts an important influence on Earth's climate, owing to
its]{.mark} high surface reflectivity ([albedo]{.mark}).**
**[This]{.mark} property gives it the ability to reflect a large
fraction of solar radiation back into space, and [influences how much
solar energy is absorbed by land and oceans]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Ice
on land, in the form of ice sheets and glaciers, plays a further
important role in the Earth system through its ability to store vast
amounts of water away from the oceans for long periods of time. [Any
change in the ice volume stored on land, as ice sheets and glaciers grow
or shrink, has a direct impact on global mean sea level. **[As]{.mark}
the [climate changes]{.mark}, the [cryosphere changes with i]{.mark}t
and, [through feedback processes, these changes have an influence
on]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark}. For example, the [increased melting of
snow and ice]{.mark} caused by a warming planet [enables more solar
energy to be absorbed by land or water,]{.mark} which [in turn leads to
more warming]{.mark}. [This is]{.mark} also [known as the snow- or
ice-albedo feedback]{.mark}.**]{.underline} There are fundamental
differences in the timescales over which the different components of the
cryosphere evolve. [Due to their large volumes and areas, [the
continental ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica undergo changes over
timescales of up to millennia, and influence their regional weather and
climate]{.mark}. [Glaciers]{.mark}, with their much smaller volumes and
areas, [react to climate drivers]{.mark} at typical timescales of years
to centuries. Lake and river ice, at an even smaller size, are good
climate indicators at a seasonal timescale. [Snow and sea ice]{.mark}
are both of small volumes but large areas, with high seasonal
variability, and hence [interact]{.mark} strongly and rapidly
[with]{.mark} the [atmosphere]{.mark} above, [and]{.mark} with the ocean
or [land surface below]{.mark}. On timescales of years to
centuries\[1\], **[permafrost interacts with the global climate through
the storage or release of large amounts of
methane.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Observations of some components of the
cryosphere have been carried out for a long time. However, to assess
global change, vast observational networks, including in situ stations
as well as satellites, are needed. This means that reliable global
estimates only go back to when such systems were first in place. For
example, systematic in situ observations allow for global estimates of
glacier change for the last half century, whereas satellite networks
have continually improved and expanded to remotely monitor various
components of the Earth system: sea ice extent for over four decades,
ice sheets for close to three decades and sea ice thickness for the last
two decades. Here we present global estimates of change for those
components of the cryosphere which are included in the C3S Climate
Indicators and for which data are accessible via the Climate Data Store.
Our assessment highlights the large changes that have already taken
place across the cryosphere due to the evolving climate.

#### Warming alters nature of currents and leads to more ice melt.

**NASA '20** \[February 6, NASA explores the unknown in air and space,
innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through
discovery, NASA, "Arctic Ice Melt Is Changing Ocean Currents",
<https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2950/arctic-ice-melt-is-changing-ocean-currents/#:~:text=A%20major%20ocean%20current%20in,of%20human%2Dcaused%20climate%20change>\]
**[JM]{.underline}**

[A [major ocean current in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} is faster and
more turbulent as a result of rapid sea ice melt, a new study from NASA
shows. The current is part of a delicate Arctic environment that [is now
flooded with fresh water]{.mark}, [an effect of]{.mark} human-caused
[climate change]{.mark}. Using 12 years of satellite data, scientists
have measured how [this]{.mark} circular [current]{.mark}, called
[the]{.mark} [**Beaufort Gyre**, has]{.mark} precariously [balanced an
influx of unprecedented amounts of cold, fresh water --- a change that
could alter]{.mark} the [currents in the Atlantic Ocean]{.mark} and
[cool]{.mark} the [climate of Western Europe]{.mark}. [The]{.mark}
Beaufort [Gyre keeps the polar environment in equilibrium by storing
fresh water near the surface of the ocean]{.mark}. **Wind blows the gyre
in a clockwise direction around the western Arctic Ocean, north of
Canada and Alaska, where it naturally collects fresh water from glacial
melt, river runoff and precipitation.** [This fresh water]{.mark} is
important in the Arctic in part because it floats above the warmer,
salty water and [helps]{.mark} to protect the sea ice from melting,
which in turn helps **[regulate Earth\'s climate]{.mark}**. The gyre
then slowly releases this fresh water into the Atlantic Ocean over a
period of decades, allowing the Atlantic Ocean currents to carry it away
in small amounts. But the [since the 1990s, the gyre has accumulated a
large amount of fresh water]{.mark} **--- 1,920 cubic miles (8,000 cubic
kilometers) --- or almost twice the volume of Lake Michigan. The new
study, published in Nature Communications, found that the [cause of this
gain]{.mark}** in freshwater concentration [is]{.mark} the **[loss of
sea ice in summer and autumn.]{.mark}** This decades-long [decline
of]{.mark} the [Arctic\'s summertime sea ice]{.mark} coverhas left the
Beaufort Gyre more exposed to the wind, which spins the gyre faster and
[traps]{.mark} the [fresh water in its current]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Persistent westerly winds have also dragged the current in one direction
for over 20 years, increasing the speed and size of the clockwise
current and preventing the fresh water from leaving the Arctic Ocean.
This decades-long western wind is unusual for the region, where
previously, the winds changed direction every five to seven years.
Scientists have been keeping an eye on the Beaufort Gyre in case the
wind changes direction again. If the direction were to change, the wind
would reverse the current, pulling it counterclockwise and releasing the
water it has accumulated all at once. [**\"**If the Beaufort Gyre were
to release the excess fresh water into the Atlantic Ocean, it could
potentially slow down its circulation. And that would have
hemisphere-wide implications for the climate, especially in Western
Europe,\"]{.underline} said Tom Armitage, lead author of the study and
polar scientist at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California. Fresh water released from the Arctic Ocean to the North
Atlantic can change the density of surface waters. Normally, water from
the Arctic loses heat and moisture to the atmosphere and sinks to the
bottom of the ocean, where it drives water from the north Atlantic Ocean
down to the tropics like a conveyor belt. [This important current is
called the **[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[M]{.mark}**eridional
**[O]{.mark}**verturning **[C]{.mark}**irculation and [helps regulate
the planet\'s climate by carrying heat from]{.mark} the
[tropically-warmed water to northern latitudes like Europe and North
America.]{.mark} If slowed enough, it could negatively impact marine
life and the communities that depend on it.]{.underline} \"We don\'t
expect a shutting down of the Gulf Stream, but we do expect impacts.
That\'s why we\'re monitoring the Beaufort Gyre so closely,\" said Alek
Petty, a co-author on the paper and polar scientist at NASA\'s Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. [**The study also found
that, although the Beaufort Gyre is out of balance because of the added
energy from the wind**, [the current expels]{.mark} that [excess energy
by forming small, circular eddies of water]{.mark}. While the [increased
turbulence]{.mark} has helped keep the system balanced, it [has the
potential to lead to]{.mark} [**further ice melt** because it mixes
layers of cold, fresh water with relatively warm, salt water
below]{.mark}. The melting ice could, in turn, lead to changes in how
nutrients and organic material in the ocean are mixed, significantly
affecting the food chain and wildlife in the Arctic. The results reveal
a delicate balance between wind and ocean as the sea ice pack recedes
under climate change. **\"What this study is showing is that [the loss
of sea ice has really important impacts on our climate]{.mark} system
that we\'re only just discovering,\" said Petty.**]{.underline}

### Arctic Ice Melt -\> Polar Amplification

#### Runaway ice melt in the Arctic will accelerate warming and lock-in catastrophic sea level rise and natural disasters -- only geoengineering can restore Arctic ice sheets and reverse warming trends

Katarina **Zimmer**, 9/23/**2020**, BBC, "The daring plan to save the
Arctic ice with glass,"
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200923-could-geoengineering-save-the-arctic-sea-ice,
mm

[One of the most important]{.underline}, yet underappreciated, [features
of the Arctic sea ice is the ability of its]{.underline} blindingly
[white surfaces to reflect sunlight.]{.underline} For at least as long
as our species has existed, [the frozen seas at the top of our world
have acted as a massive parasol that helps keep the planet cool and its
climate stable]{.underline}. Yet now, [much of that ice is rapidly
vanishing]{.underline}. [Rising temperatures have locked the Arctic in a
self-destructive feedback loop:]{.underline} the warmer it gets, the
reflective white ice dissolves into darker, blue water, which absorbs
more of the Sun's warmth rather than reflecting it back into space.
Warmer water accelerates melting, which means yet more absorption of
heat, which drives further melting -- and so on in a vicious cycle that
is part of the reason why [the Arctic is warming around twice as fast as
the rest of the planet]{.underline}. This July, ice cover was as low as
it had ever been at that time of the year. As planet-warming greenhouse
gas emissions continue to rise, some have been driven to explore
desperate measures. One proposal put forward by the California-based
non-profit Arctic Ice Project appears as daring as it is bizarre: to
scatter a thin layer of reflective glass powder over parts of the
Arctic, in an effort to protect it from the Sun's rays and help ice grow
back. "We're trying to break \[that\] feedback loop and start
rebuilding," says engineer Leslie Field, an adjunct lecturer at Stanford
University and chief technical officer of the organisation. [The melting
of the sea ice has impacts far beyond the Arcti]{.underline}c and its
inhabitants. [The melting of sea ice indirectly contributes to rising
sea levels by lowering the sea surface\'s albedo.]{.underline} Some say
[it's already disrupting weather patterns around the globe]{.underline}.
[If we lose our protective white shield entirely]{.underline} -- which
some reckon could happen just decades from now -- [it could have the
same warming effect as another 25 years of fossil fuel emissions at
current rates]{.underline}, **[which would mean more intense droughts,
flooding and heat waves.]{.underline}** By [rebuilding sea
ice]{.underline}, Field hopes her approach [will]{.underline} also
[restore]{.underline} [its ancient function as a planetary
air-conditioner and help **counteract the effects of global
warming.**]{.underline} Many scientists frown upon such technological
interventions in Earth's planetary system, known broadly as
"geoengineering", arguing that fiddling with nature might cause further
damage. However, "[the utter lack of progress on climate mitigation is
really opening up a space for]{.underline} all of these
\[[geoengineering]{.underline}\] things to be discussed," says Emily
Cox, who studies climate policy and public attitudes towards
geoengineering at the University of Cardiff. That said, the urgency does
not erase the uncertainty. "What do you do if something goes wrong...
especially in the Arctic, which is already a fairly fragile ecosystem?"
Field launched the Arctic Ice Project --- formerly known as ICE911 ---
in 2008, soon after watching the climate change documentary An
Inconvenient Truth, which convinced her of the urgency of doing
something about the melting sea ice. In particular, it's the fate of
old, thick sea ice that worries her the most -- the kind that lasts
multiple years. This mature ice, dazzlingly white, has a high albedo,
meaning it's extremely good at reflecting sunlight -- much more so than
the thinner and darker young ice that forms each polar winter only to
melt again during the summer. Yet over the past 33 years, that ice has
dwindled by a staggering 95%. What if, Field asked, she could layer a
reflective material on top of the young ice to protect it during the
summer months? If it had that [extra protection]{.underline},
[could]{.underline} it [rebuild]{.underline} into [sturdy multi-year
ice, and kick-start a local process of ice regrowth]{.underline}? She
settled on silica -- or silicon dioxide -- which occurs naturally in
most sand and is often used to make glass, as the material of choice.
She found a manufacturer that turns it into tiny, brightly reflective
beads, each one 65 micrometers in diameter -- thinner than a human hair,
but too large for them to be inhaled and cause lung problems, Field
says. The beads are also hollow inside, so they'll float on water and
continue to reflect away sunlight even if the ice begins to melt.

#### Rapid warming will decimate the Arctic -- emissions reductions won't come fast enough

Geoengineering has long been on the fringes of climate science. Critics
have argued that tinkering with the planet at such a large scale is far
too risky, and could have disastrous consequences. But [with global
temperatures continuing to rise,]{.underline} a growing number of
scientists are supporting research in the contentious field.
[Geoengineering]{.underline}, they argue, [might be the only hope of
avoiding a climate catastrophe]{.underline}. Last month, Harvard
University made headlines when it launched a new solar geoengineering
research program. Researchers there hope to conduct their first
real-world experiment in 2018, when they'll release tiny reflective
particles into the stratosphere from a hot-air balloon, and then measure
its effectiveness at reducing solar radiation below. The \$20 million
project is expected to be the largest geoengineering experiment ever
done. "To me, solar geoengineering is terrifying," Daniel Schrag, a
professor of environmental science and engineering at Harvard, conceded
in a video released with the announcement of the new research program.
"We're talking about an engineering project that could affect every
living thing on this planet. The possibility that something could go
wrong is really scary." But, Schrag said, [it could take decades or
longer for the world's energy system to shift from fossil fuels to
renewables -- **and by then climate impacts could be
devastating**]{.underline}. "[The evidence is becoming clearer and
clearer that not doing geoengineering and letting climate change proceed
might be worse]{.underline}, as an alternative," he said. Schrag isn't
alone. In 2015, the U.S. National Academy of Science warned against the
risks of geoengineering but, for the first time, recommended more
research to determine its potential. Earlier this year, [scientific
advisers to the U.S. government urged more funding for
geoengineering]{.underline} [research]{.underline} to provide "insight
into the science needed to understand potential pathways for climate
intervention or geoengineering, and the possible consequences, both
intended and unintended." Over the years, [a number of climate
engineering schemes have been proposed for the Arctic, to slow the
melting of sea ice and glaciers]{.underline}. One idea was to cover the
landscape with massive white tarps that would reflect the sun's heat.
Another suggested damming the entire Bering Strait, to stop the flow of
warmer water from the south. Last December, a team from Arizona State
University published a proposal to build wind turbines in the Arctic to
pump water onto sea ice, to thicken and preserve it. The plan, which was
published in the American Geophysical Union's journal Earth's Future,
would require 10 million windmills and cost a staggering \$500 billion,
leading some to call it the Manhattan Project of climate change. Steve
Desch, a co-author of the proposal and a professor of astrophysics at
Arizona State University, said he felt compelled into action after
attending a climatology conference several years ago. "I realized that
[the climate science community has basically one answer]{.underline}
\[for climate change\]: [stop CO2 emissions]{.underline}, which, of
course, is the correct answer," he said. "[But I also became aware of
how urgent the need is in the Arctic, and though we probably will reduce
CO2]{.underline} -- we have to [-- it won't be fast enough to preserve
the sea ice]{.underline}."

#### Arctic amplification is a key driver of global warming -- positive feedback loops and tipping points will trigger a dramatic increase in global temperatures by mid-century

[The Arctic affects global oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns,
influencing weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere]{.underline}
(NH). [Cold Arctic temperatures have played a central role in keeping
the global climate relatively stable throughout human history. As the
world warms due to anthropogenically-driven global warming, the
temperature rises even faster in the Arctic]{.underline}. A recent
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) study reports
that [the Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the planet, a
phenomenon known as Arctic Amplification]{.underline}.2 While the mean
global temperature has increased by about 1 °C,3 the Arctic has
experienced a warming of about 2 °C in the same time period. [Rapid
warming in the Arctic has led to a dramatic loss of sea
ice.]{.underline} Arctic sea ice area at the end of summer 2019 was the
second lowest since satellite observations began in 1979.4 (See
Figure 1) These changes are occurring rapidly. [In most
simulations]{.underline} of future global warming, [the Arctic Ocean
becomes practically sea-ice free]{.underline} (sea-ice area \<1 million
square km) in September for the first time [before the Year
2050]{.underline}.5 While scientists have identified several processes
contributing to Arctic amplification, in this article we focus on the
positive feedback mechanism called [sea ice reflectivity]{.underline}.6
It plays a significant role in Arctic amplification that we [believe can
be leveraged to slow global warming]{.underline}. Several studies show
that the [sea ice reflectivity feedback alone is responsible for a
significant fraction of global warming---the equivalent of up to 25
percent of the warming due to CO2 emissions from 1979 to
2008]{.underline}.7 Author Peter Wadhams estimates that the warming due
to the land-snow-ice feedback is roughly equivalent to an additional 25
percent of global CO2 emissions and are disrupting Arctic atmospheric
and oceanic circulation patterns.8 [As Arctic sea ice continues to
disappear with increasing global warming these feedback loops will
become even more important]{.underline}. [The interaction of these
feedback processes has turned Arctic warming from a consequence **into a
driver of global warming.**]{.underline} T[he loss of Arctic sea ice has
been linked to extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere.]{.underline}
Polar temperatures have warmed two to three times as fast as subtropic
temperatures. [This warming weakens the jet stream]{.underline} making
it more likely to create stationary weather patterns persisting for many
days[. A weakened polar jet stream has been linked to the extreme
weather events]{.underline} of 2018. Temperatures in the southwest
United States rose above 37.8 °C (100 °F) for days, heavy rains and
floods inundated the mid-Atlantic states, and California experienced
unprecedented droughts and wildfires. The Southwest witnessed a
persistent heat wave, and the mid-Atlantic endured heavy flooding.
Japan, Scandinavia, and much of Europe had persistent heat waves leading
to wildfires in Greece9 [As global warming continues to heat the Arctic
there is also a significant risk of reaching a tipping point, where the
effects of climate change go from advancing gradually to changing
dramatically very quickly]{.underline}. Veerabhadran Ramanathan,
professor of atmospheric and climate sciences at Scripps Institute of
Oceanography, said: "[Losing the reflective power of Arctic sea ice will
lead to a warming equivalent to one trillion tons of CO2 and advance the
2 °C threshold \[within\] 25 years**. Any rational policy would make
preventing this a top climate priority for world
leaders."**]{.underline}10

faster]{.mark}. And data from the 40 years leading up to 2022, based on
the region north of 66°N (the Arctic Circle rather than the broader 60°N
definition used in atmospheric sciences), suggests it may be nearly four
times faster.**]{.underline} We should be beyond the point of chasing
new Arctic climate records---this isn't a competition. People know the
climate crisis is here, even if some avoid taking action. The frozen
Arctic is disappearing because of mankind's insatiable appetite for
burning fossil fuels. Losing it has global consequences---[**[what
happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
But the consequences are also Arctic---as a melting Arctic means losing
its unique wildlife, ecosystems, landscapes, and Indigenous cultures.
[**More critically, [we are losing the cryosphere]{.mark}**---the
**frozen world of snow, sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, and permafrost.**
This **[frozen world helps regulate]{.mark}** **the [climate and keep
sea levels stable]{.mark}**. Without it, the entire planet is at
risk.]{.underline} The loss of Arctic sea ice has been dramatic, with a
decline of about 60 per cent since 1900, most of which has happened
since 1980. [**[With]{.mark} [less ice to reflect sunlight, more heat is
absorbed by]{.mark} the [ocean, contributing to changes in]{.mark}
[atmospheric and oceanic patterns.]{.mark} These [shifts]{.mark} have
been [widely discussed in relation to extreme weather events in]{.mark}
the [Northern Hemisphere]{.mark}.** **[Thawing permafrost releases
additional greenhouse gases into]{.mark} the [atmosphere]{.mark},
estimated to add the emissions of a medium sized country to the
atmosphere over the course of this century. [Once]{.mark} this [process
begins, it will continue for hundreds of years]{.mark}, [leaving]{.mark}
future [generations to deal with]{.mark} its
[effects.]{.mark}**]{.underline} One of the biggest concerns is the
Greenland Ice Sheet, which is considered a major global tipping point.
Scientists estimate that its threshold for slow but inevitable
disintegration lies somewhere between 1.5 and 2.2 degrees of global
warming. With current commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, we are on
track for 2.3 degrees of warming by 2100. This would be sufficient to
melt large parts of Greenland and West Antarctica, leading to sea-level
rise exceeding 10 metres in the coming centuries. The speed and
magnitude of this long-term, **[[unstoppable sea-level rise will cause
persistent challenges for coastal regions including widespread loss of
agricultural land, infrastructure, and
livelihoods.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Today, about 75 per cent of cities
with more than five million inhabitants are located below 10 metres in
elevation, making this a crisis that will affect millions. The Arctic is
transforming before our eyes. People living in the region no longer
recognize the seasons, the wildlife they bring, or what activities are
safe to carry out. Life is out of sync, making Indigenous cultures
increasingly vulnerable. Traditional travel and transport on snow and
ice have become unreliable and even unsafe, threatening food security
for those who rely on country foods. [**[Permafrost coasts are eroding,
forcing]{.mark} entire [communities to relocate]{.mark}. [Thawing
permafrost is]{.mark} also [destabilizing slopes, causing
landslides]{.mark} and [altering river ecosystems]{.mark}. In the Arctic
Ocean, fish communities are shifting as southern species move north,
squeezing Arctic species into ever-smaller spaces where they face local
extinction. [On land, similar changes are happening altering]{.mark}
entire [landscapes]{.mark}, as [vegetation and animal populations are
pushed toward]{.mark} the [Arctic coastline]{.mark}, with nowhere left
to go.** The only solution is to stop burning fossil fuels.]{.underline}
To keep the global temperature overshoot beyond 1.5 degrees to a
minimum, we must cut emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 and reach carbon
neutrality by 2050. This is a Herculean effort that requires absolute
focus and determination. The fate of the Arctic---and with it, much of
humanity's well-being---rests in the hands of those making decisions to
reduce and stop the burning of fossil fuels. There are no quick fixes or
alternatives. It is still possible to change course, but action must
happen now. **[At the moment, there is no clear leadership, and [climate
negotiations remain deadlocked]{.mark}. But we cannot negotiate with the
melting point of ice.]{.underline}**

### AMOC Scenario: Arctic Ice Melt -\> AMOC Shutdown

#### Melting Arctic ice poses a threat to ocean currents. These currents are crucial to maintaining a stable global temp.

**Rodrigues '24** \[Meghie, May 2024, Meghie Rodrigues is a journalist

development, Pesquisa FAPESP, "Global warming threatens main Atlantic
Ocean current system"
https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/global-warming-threatens-main-atlantic-ocean-current-system/\]
JM

In the 2004 blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow, melting of the Arctic
ice cap causes a collapse of the North Atlantic's current system.
**[[The change in the ocean's circulation pattern]{.mark} is the
starting point of a climate catastrophe that throws the planet into a
new ice age.]{.underline}** According to an article published in the
journal Science Advances in February, the Atlantic section of the
intercontinental ocean circulation is set to become so weak as a result
of climate change that it may reach a point of no return. The paper did
not estimate when the change might occur --- it could be a matter of
years or decades. "We are moving closer \[to the collapse\], but we
we're not sure how much closer," oceanographer René van Westen of
Utrecht University, Netherlands, lead author of the study, told news
agency Reuters. The article points out that a weakening of the current
system --- [[called the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
(AMOC)**]{.mark} --- [could cause major rainfall and temperature changes
before the end of the century.]{.mark} A [slower AMOC would make]{.mark}
the [Northern Hemisphere colder over]{.mark} the [coming decades,
especially in North America and northern Europe]{.mark}. [At the same
time, the Southern Hemisphere would become even
warmer.]{.mark}]{.underline} Although there would not be a new ice age
as depicted in the over-the-top Hollywood movie, the implications of the
phenomenon could be significant. The paper was based on climate
modeling, which supported the observational and paleoclimatic evidence
that the AMOC has become 15% slower in the last two decades and is now
the weakest it has been this millennium. According to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2023 report, "there is
medium confidence that there will not be an abrupt collapse before 2100,
but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in
regional weather patterns and major impacts on ecosystems and human
activities." The previous version of the report, from 2021, estimated
that the chance of a complete collapse of the AMOC by the end of the
century was between 4% and 46% in the scenario that greenhouse gas
emissions were curbed (with global warming not much higher than current
levels) and between 17% and 55% in the event that emissions rise
significantly. In an article published at the end of last year,
scientists from Brazil and Germany used climate models to determine the
potential effects a collapse of the AMOC would have on the Amazon
rainforest. The study, published in the journal Communications Earth &
Environment, indicates that in the worst-case scenario for climate
change, a cessation of the current system could initially alleviate
droughts in the region. "But this would only be a temporary delay in the
process of the Amazon becoming a savanna," says oceanographer Regina
Rodrigues of the Climate Extremes Laboratory at the Federal University
of Santa Catarina (UFSC), coauthor of the article. Rodrigues estimates
that the savannization process (when the dense and enclosed tropical
forest is replaced with sparser vegetation and few trees, similar to a
savanna) would be delayed by approximately a decade, intensifying in the
2050s instead of the 2040s. "This deferral would not be of any benefit
to the Amazon and the slowdown of the AMOC would have major impacts on
the global climate," stresses the scientist. [The weakening of the AMOC
is indirectly caused by global warming. [Warmer temperatures cause more
ice to melt in]{.mark} the [Arctic region]{.mark}**. [This
increases]{.mark} the [amount of fresh water and decreases]{.mark} the
[salinity of]{.mark} the [ocean around]{.mark} the [south of
Greenland]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} a region the AMOC passes through. **[The
change makes the ocean current in the area slow down]{.mark},
[potentially to]{.mark} the [point]{.mark} that [it would collapse
entirely.]{.mark} "When the sea surface is less salty, it freezes much
more quickly," explains Letícia Cotrim da Cunha, an oceanographer from
Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ). When it solidifies, the less
saline water forms a fine layer of ice on the sea surface. "It's like
putting a barrier in the way of surface waters that should sink to the
depths," says the researcher.** **The [AMOC is essential to maintaining
the planet's current thermal balance]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The upper
portion of the AMOC transports warm water, which circulates on the
surface because it is less dense, from the high latitudes of the South
Atlantic to southern Greenland. There, the surface waters of the Weddell
Sea lose heat to the atmosphere, become denser, and sink. "We call this
process deep convection," says César Barbedo Rocha, a physical
oceanographer from the Oceanographic Institute at the University of São
Paulo (IO-USP). The deeper waters are transported by the lower portion
of the AMOC, which begins to circulate at a depth of 3,000 to 4,000
meters, where they begin their journey back to the high latitudes of the
South Atlantic. [**As this cold water passes through the tropics and
reaches the south of the planet, some returns to the surface as a result
of mixing with overlying warmer waters and strong westerly winds around
Antarctica. This process is called upwelling. [The AMOC is]{.mark}
therefore [like a global conveyor belt]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [carries
cold waters at great depths from the Arctic to the Antarctic and warm
waters on the surface from south to north.]{.mark}]{.underline} To
determine the true risk of the AMOC collapsing, more studies are needed.
Direct measurements of the circulation system only began being taken in
2004. "We have around 20 years of data, which is very little in the time
scale of a process as complex as the AMOC. The current can vary greatly
from month to month and year to year, and these fluctuations have the
potential to mask trends," says Rocha. The two decades of direct
observations do not clearly show the slowdown of the AMOC as indicated
by climate modeling studies like the one described in Science Advances.
The measurements are not taken uniformly across the Atlantic basin: most
are concentrated in the northern region of the ocean between Europe and
the USA. Many scientists from the Northern Hemisphere say that the Gulf
Stream, which begins in the Gulf of Mexico and travels along the east
coast of the USA to Europe, is the current that best indicates
variations in the AMOC. Some Brazilian oceanographers, however, argue
that the weakening of the circulation is more observable in the Southern
Hemisphere and near the tropics. Data on the AMOC has been collected off
the Brazilian coast for the last 13 years. One project that aims to
install sensors and measure AMOC heat variations is Sambar, funded by
FAPESP and led by IO-USP's Edmo Campos. By observing the changes around
the 34.5th parallel south --- which passes through the municipality of
Chuí, in Rio Grande do Sul, and Cape Town, in South Africa --- the
project has already identified signs of temperature changes in deep
waters in the region. Physical oceanographer Ilana Wainer, a colleague
of Campos at IO-USP, is also looking for "fingerprints" of a change in
the AMOC's balance. "Data from the past show that this weakening, or
change in balance, can happen," says the scientist. Her research topics
include changes in the South Atlantic circulation during the Middle
Pliocene (around 3 million years ago), when the earth's average
temperature was around 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (ºC) higher than in the
preindustrial period of the mid-nineteenth century. One of these
fingerprints is the change that occurs in the bifurcation of the
southern branch of the South Equatorial Current (which does not appear
in the illustration on page 58) near the northeastern coast of Brazil.
"If the fork moves further south, that means more is transported to the
north, feeding the upper section of the AMOC. But, if it moves to the
north, transport increases to the south, weakening the contribution to
the upper AMOC," explains Wainer. This mechanism could help explain why
the current system is weakening[**.** [To function properly, the AMOC
relies on the transportation of water from the South Atlantic to
Greenland]{.mark}.]{.underline} "We carried out investigations with
numerical modeling data on different time scales and found the same
behavior," says oceanographer Fernanda Marcello, who is doing a
postdoctorate at IO-USP under Wainer's supervision. Simulations were
analyzed for the last 22,000 years --- since the end of the Last Glacial
Maximum (ice age) --- in addition to others focused on more recent
periods, from the last 2,000 years. Based on the simulations and direct
measurements, the current status of the AMOC is not yet completely
clear, but [[the risk of the ocean circulation collapsing must not be
ignored.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Methane Scenario -- Positive Feedback Loop

#### Permafrost thaw releases methane- this reinforces the positive feedback loop and increases warming.

[**Permafrost thaw is one of the gravest yet lesser discussed impacts of
climate change. [Permafrost covers 24 percent of the surface of land
masses in]{.mark} the [northern hemisphere]{.mark} and [accounts for
nearly half of all organic carbon stored within the planet's
soil]{.mark}.** As long as this organic matter remains frozen, it will
stay trapped in the permafrost. **However, [if it thaws, microbes
will]{.mark} begin to [eat the material]{.mark}, causing it to decay and
[releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere]{.mark}. [Even
if]{.mark} a [small fraction of these greenhouse gases are
released]{.mark}, it will have major consequences on not only the
Arctic, but Earth's entire climate system, as [they intensify]{.mark}
global [climate change]{.mark}.** **[Permafrost temperatures]{.mark} are
[rising at]{.mark} a [much faster rate than]{.mark} the
[temp]{.mark}erature of the air [in the Arctic]{.mark}**, and [have
risen between 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius]{.mark} in the last 30 years.
As a result, permafrost layers are melting. A **[3 degree Celsius
increase]{.mark} in global temperatures [could melt 30 to 85 percent
of]{.mark} the [top permafrost layers]{.mark} that exist across the
Arctic region, destroying infrastructure and irreversibly changing the
unique terrain and ecosystems at the top of the world.** As
**[permafrost degradation buckles roads, compromises homes]{.mark}, and
[changes the landscape of a homeland to four million people]{.mark}**,
it is without a doubt one of the most serious threats to people both
within and beyond the Arctic in this century**.**]{.underline} The
Arctic Institute's new two-part series examines permafrost thaw from
different perspectives in an effort to understand and contextualize this
complex phenomenon. The first part will be published this September,
October, and November 2020, while the second part will follow in winter
2021. The papers in this series include personal encounters with
permafrost thaw, scientific analyses of the issue, reflections on how
permafrost thaw affects North American security and economics, and
artistic initiatives aimed at education. The Institute also aims to host
several webinars with guest experts who will further discuss and analyze
the implications of permafrost degradation and how it affects not only
the Arctic, but the rest of the world. We look forward to sharing this
work with you. [**In recent years,** [permafrost thaw]{.mark} has become
a salient and pervasive threat that touches life in all corners of the
Arctic, and [impacts]{.mark} the [wellbeing of Arctic residents,
ecosystems, economies]{.mark}, and [planetary health **in four key ways:
erosion, destabilizing landscapes and buildings, flooding hazards and
forced migration, and diseases.**]{.mark} **Furthermore, contending with
permafrost thaw is especially difficult, as it is influenced by global
processes of warming and this is hard to change and control in a short
period of time. Combating permafrost thaw will take a concerted effort
from people and states across the world, as this problem clearly extends
beyond the boundaries of the Arctic. The Arctic is warming more than two
times faster than the global average. [Permafrost thaw contributes
to]{.mark} a [positive feedback loop]{.mark} that [further
accelerates]{.mark} the [warming of Earth, releasing methane]{.mark},
which is a [more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon]{.mark}, directly
into the atmosphere, and contributing to the spread of devastating
Arctic wildfires.** Though its lifespan in the atmosphere is much
shorter than carbon dioxide, **[methane's impact on climate
change]{.mark}** has been **[found to be 25 times greater over a
100-year period]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While the Arctic was previously
considered a carbon sink, new research shows that the region is emitting
more carbon than it is absorbing, largely due to permafrost thaw. It is
estimated that the world's permafrost contains up to 1,700 billion
tonnes of carbon, which is almost double the amount of carbon in the
Earth's atmosphere, and four times more than what has already been
emitted by humans as since the Industrial Revolution. If all permafrost
were degraded to the point of decomposing, the disastrous effects would
be felt all over the world. [We are already seeing the direct effects of
permafrost thaw. In the world's most remote corners, shorelines are
receding at alarming rates. **[Permafrost thaw works in tandem with
reduced Arctic sea ice]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Normally, the
ice acts as a wave-break along the Arctic coastline, protecting the land
from storms. But [[with longer ice-free periods]{.mark} and coastal
earth that is already softer than normal due to the melt, a single storm
can erode up to 20 meters of shoreline. [Arctic coastlines have
seen]{.mark} an [average erosion rate of]{.mark} [nearly half a meter
per year over]{.mark} the [last fifty years]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
Experts estimate that some Arctic islands, particularly in northern
Russia, may soon be washed into the sea[**.** In Alaska and the Canadian
north, dozens of people have been displaced as the ocean edges ever
closer to their towns and homes**, often leaving houses teetering on the
edge of the North American continent.** [Permafrost thaw]{.mark} also
[destabilizes the ground above it]{.mark}, **[damaging critical
infrastructure, causing unprecedented flooding]{.mark}, and [displacing
entire communities]{.mark}.** [Soil that was once frozen year-round is
now thawing and refreezing each year]{.mark}. When the ground thaws, the
soil contracts and sinks, and when it freezes again it expands and
rises. This continuous cycle shifts, displaces, and breaks whatever lies
above it -- roads, railroad tracks, pipes, buildings, and more. In many
Russian Arctic cities, more than half of the buildings have been damaged
by the shifting earth, and the stability of entire cities is at
risk.]{.underline} In remote Russian regions, scientists have discovered
massive craters that they believe are being caused by methane eruptions
from thawing permafrost[**.** Meanwhile, [in]{.mark} the [Canadian
Arctic]{.mark}, [damage to infrastructure has caused a housing
shortage]{.mark}, leading to a spike in rent rates and driving them
higher than some of the world's most expensive cities. Furthermore,
[permafrost thaw is turning previously frozen earth into ponds and
swamps]{.mark}, the **[emergence of which continues to
accelerate]{.mark} the [melting process]{.mark}**. **This transformation
from solid ground to porous ponds has increased flooding for communities
across the North American and Russian Arctic.** [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} who reside [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} are
[particularly affected]{.mark}, and [have seen their ancestral lands and
burial grounds washed away]{.mark}. Indigenous lifestyles, economies,
food security, and customs are threatened as well, as changing
ecosystems disrupt familiar natural patterns, and the melting ground
destroys ice cellars, which are a key part in Indigenous subsistence
lifestyles. Instead of storing food in the frozen ground for months, a
strategy that has been practiced for thousands of years, community food
stocks are now at risk of rotting, creating further food insecurity in
an already at-risk area.]{.underline} In Scandinavia, reindeer herders
are facing difficulties as the ground shifts and new bodies of water
appear in places where they didn't exist previously[**.** Many [Arctic
Indigenous communities]{.mark} also [face displacement from]{.mark}
their [traditional homelands]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Alaska, more than
30 communities face an imminent risk of displacement and need for
relocation away from erosion and floods -- an endeavour that costs
millions of dollars and further contributes to housing insecurity in the
region. In Russia, villages are usually not moved, and Indigenous
residents are often forced to relocate to cities -- a jarring and
traumatic experience for people who have lived off the land for
generations. Such forced migrations from rural villages to urban
agglomerations strains intergenerational knowledge, language, and
traditions exchange that have already been damaged by discriminatory
policies. [**Finally, experts are studying how** [thawing permafrost may
lead to the reemergence of harmful bacteria and
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} that have been frozen in the earth for
hundreds of years and could harm Arctic ecosystems. An instance of this
has already been seen in 2016, when an anthrax outbreak from a rotting
animal carcass found in the permafrost caused over 70 people to be
hospitalized in northern Russia, and killed a child and more than 2,300
reindeer. The effects of permafrost degradation are not only contained
within the Arctic, but threaten to spill across boundaries and affect
people beyond the region. Permafrost thaw contributes to the release of
powerful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and contributes to
massive wildfires, which affect air quality levels in places thousands
of miles away.

### Methane Scenario -- AT Can't Happen

#### Robust scientific support proves a methane burst is possible -- ignored any analysis that doesn't account for the Arctic

Nafeez **Ahmed**, 8/5/**13**, The Guardian, "Seven facts you need to
know about the Arctic methane timebomb,"
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/05/7-facts-need-to-know-arctic-methane-time-bomb,
mm

[A]{.underline} widely cited 2011 [Nature]{.underline}
[review]{.underline} [dismissed such a]{.underline} catastrophic
[scenario]{.underline} as implausible because methane \"gas hydrates
occur at low saturations and in sediments at such great depths below the
seafloor or onshore permafrost that they will barely be affected by
\[contemporary levels of\] warming over even \[1,000\] yr.\" [But this
study and others like]{.underline} [it]{.underline} completely [ignore
the new empirical evidence on permafrost-associated shallow water
methane hydrates on the Arctic shelf]{.underline}. Scientific reviews
that have accounted for the empirically-observed dynamics of
permafrost-associated methane come to the opposite conclusion. In 2007,
[scientists]{.underline} Matthew Reagan and George Moridis [at the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]{.underline} published a paper in
Geophysical Research Letters exploring the vulnerability of methane gas
hydrates. They [concluded]{.underline} based on simulations of different
types of oceanic gas hydrate responding to seafloor temperature changes:
\"\... while many deep [hydrate deposits]{.underline} are indeed stable
under the influence of rapid seafloor temperature variations, shallow
deposits, such as those found in arctic regions or in the Gulf of
Mexico, [can undergo rapid dissociation and produce significant carbon
fluxes over a period of decades]{.underline}.\" [A 2010
scientific]{.underline} [analysis]{.underline} led by the UK\'s Met
Office in Review of Geophysics [found]{.underline}: [\"The time scales
for destabilization]{.underline} of marine hydrates [are]{.underline}
not well understood and are likely to be very long for hydrates found in
deep sediments but [much shorter for hydrates below shallow waters, such
as in the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}\... Overall, uncertainties are
large, and it is difficult to be conclusive about the time scales and
magnitudes of methane feedbacks, but significant increases in methane
emissions are likely, and catastrophic emissions cannot be ruled out\...
[The risk of a rapid increase in \[methane\] emissions is
real]{.underline} but remains largely unquantified.\" [Another extensive
scientific review]{.underline} of data from the ESAS gathered between
1995 and 2011 [by over twenty Arctic specialists]{.underline} published
in the Proceedings of the Russian Academy of Sciences similarly
[concluded that]{.underline}: \"The \[ESAS\] is a powerful supplier of
methane to the atmosphere owing to the continued degradation of the
submarine permafrost, which causes the destruction of gas hydrates. The
emission of methane in several areas of the \[ESAS\] is massive to the
extent that growth in the methane concentrations in the atmosphere to
values capable of causing a considerable and even [catastrophic warming
on the Earth is possible]{.underline}.\" [Other recent scientific
reviews corroborate these findings]{.underline}.

### Solvency - Every Degree Matters

#### Every fraction of a degree matters

Daisy **Simmons**, 2/13/**23**, \[assistant editor at Yale Climate
Connections\], Yale Climate Connections, "Myth-buster: Why two degrees
of global warming is worse than it sounds,"
https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/02/myth-why-two-degrees-of-global-warming-is-worse-than-it-sounds/,
mm

[A couple of degrees]{.underline} Celsius might not sound like a lot.
But in terms of global [warming]{.underline}, it [is a big
deal.]{.underline} In fact, **[[every tenth of a
degree]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the Earth warms in the future [[will
make a difference]{.underline}]{.mark} in the impacts that people
experience worldwide and in your neck of the woods. Picture yourself: In
Phoenix, Arizona, where you have to endure roughly nine additional days
of over 110 degrees Fahrenheit per year than people here used to. In
Montecito, California, where if you're not shopping for new air filters
due to expected wildfire smoke, you're practicing your evacuation plan
in preparation for the mudslides that are becoming more common on
fire-scarred hillsides. In a Gulf Coast community, where hurricanes are
getting more frequent and more severe --- like Hurricane Ian, which was
10% wetter than it would have been if not for climate change. Those are
just some of the impacts we're already seeing as a result of the one
degree Celsius the world has already warmed since the late 19th century.
And the consequences to everyday life will only get more severe with
every degree of change. That's why the world's governments pledged in
the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming below 2 degrees
Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) --- and preferably to 1.5 degrees C
(2.7 F). Yet [[current]{.underline}]{.mark} policies and [[pathways put
the world on]{.underline}]{.mark} [[track]{.underline} [to a
2.8]{.underline}]{.mark} C/5 F temperature [[rise]{.underline}]{.mark}
by the end of the century, according to the United Nations Environment
Program's Emissions Gap Report 2022. So it's important to understand
what a difference a couple of degrees really can make. Today's world is
roughly 1 C/1.8 F warmer than it was back in 1880 when people started
burning fossil fuels in earnest as part of the Industrial Revolution.
This change may look small on a thermometer, but it makes a big
difference here and now in communities across the planet. According to
NASA, 19 of the warmest years on record have taken place since 2000.
Colorado, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Texas all experienced their
hottest-ever summer nights in 2022. Hurricane Ian tied for the
fifth-strongest hurricane on record to hit the U.S. and has been
projected to be one of the costliest to ever hit Florida. And
communities across the Western U.S. are grappling with increasing
drought and growing threats to crops. Meanwhile, ice is melting at both
poles, with Antarctica losing ice mass to the tune of about 150 billion
tons per year and Greenland losing roughly 280 billion tons annually.
And [summer [Arctic sea ice]{.mark} extent [is shrinking]{.mark} by
12.6% per decade]{.underline}. All that [melting ice contributes to sea
level rise]{.underline}, threatening coastal communities and low-lying
islands globally. Longtime residents of the Isles de Jean Charles in
Louisiana, for example, have already had to abandon their homes for
higher ground, due to a combination of sinking land and sea level rise.
Meanwhile, the last decade was the ocean's warmest since at least the
1800s, with 2021 the warmest on record. Water expands as it gets warmer,
so warming oceans are responsible for between one-third and one-half of
sea level rise, whose rates of rise NASA calls "unprecedented" over the
last 2,500-plus years. That's just from one degree Celsius of change.
And [[impacts will only intensify]{.underline}]{.mark} [as]{.underline}
the [temperature]{.underline} continues to [tick up]{.underline}. A 2022
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report notes that even the
most ambitious plan of limiting warming to 1.5 C/2.7 F includes
"unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades." These
risks include threats of sea level rise to infrastructure and low-lying
coastal communities, as well as more extreme weather, drought, and
related health impacts. In a world that's 1.5 C/2.7 F warmer than in
pre-industrial times, storms, heat waves, and droughts will be even more
extreme than they are today. More homes will be lost to sea level rise
and wildfire. And more people are likely to suffer from heat-related
illnesses, infectious diseases, and starvation. Life in the 2020s
already looks different. [[With every]{.underline}]{.mark} additional
degree --- and each [[fraction of a degree]{.underline}]{.mark} --- of
warming, [the [consequences will become]{.mark}]{.underline} yet [[more
palpable]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2100. Let's say, for instance, that
people manage to keep warming below 1.5 C/2.7 F. Today's young children
could live to see nearly four times the number of extreme storms they
see now, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
research. And that's just with an additional 0.5 C of warming from where
we are today. [With 3 C]{.underline}/5.4 F [of warming]{.underline},
however, today's [kids would inherit a world with five times the
likelihood of]{.underline} hurricanes and other [severe
storms]{.underline}. The following are other examples of the difference
a degree or two could make in terms of real-world harm: More extreme
heat. In a 1.5 C/2.7 F scenario, about 14% of the world's population
will face severe heat waves at least once every five years. In a 2 C/3.6
F of warming scenario, however, that number shoots up to 37%. \[NASA\]
Increasing sea level rise. By 2100, millions more people will be exposed
to flooding from sea level rise in a 2 C/3.6 F scenario (32--80 million
people worldwide compared with 31--69 million under a 1.5 C/2.7 F
warming). \[IPCC\] Intensifying drought. Worldwide, 800 million to 3
billion people would experience chronic water scarcity at 2 C/3.6 F
warming, a figure that jumps up to as high as 4 billion in with 4 C/7.2
F warming. \[IPCC\] [[Vicious cycles]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Like a

### Solvency - Warming Locked-in -- Geoengineering Key

#### It's too late to cut emissions -- locked-in warming will melt the Arctic -- only geoengineering solves

New **Scientist**, 9/25/**24**, "Geoengineering is now essential to
saving the Arctic's ice,"
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg26335103-600-geoengineering-is-now-essential-to-saving-the-arctics-ice/,
mm

The first explorers known to have reached the North Pole spent weeks
dragging their sleds across the rough pack ice. Now, people can travel
most of the way there from the comfort of a cruise ship, their passage
eased by the catastrophic melting of ice caused by climate change. [The
Arctic is shedding ice at a rate of 12 per cent per decade and is set to
be ice-free in the summer by the 2030s]{.underline} -- [regardless of
how fast we cut emissions from now on]{.underline}. Meanwhile, in
Antarctica, the vast Thwaites glacier is cracking under the pressure of
global warming, and Antarctic sea ice has been tracking at record lows
in 2024 for the second year running. We must [cut
emissions]{.underline}, and fast, but that alone [won't be enough to
stop the runaway melt in the Arctic.]{.underline} [To buy us
time]{.underline} and to buttress this delicate habitat from a warming
world, [geoengineering is probably our only hope]{.underline}. One
solution comes from start-up Real Ice, which plans to use seawater to
thicken the Arctic's ice. It is controversial. Geoengineering of this
sort, opponents argue, risks distracting humanity from the gargantuan
task of cutting emissions. Yet there are good reasons to push ahead.
Alongside the spectacular wildlife and rich cultural heritage there,
[the polar regions do the world a huge favour. Their white caps reflect
solar radiation back into space, helping to keep Earth's climate cool.
The loss of Arctic sea ice also triggers a whole host of other feedbacks
that would amplify climate change and play havoc with weather systems
around the world.]{.underline} Of all our geoengineering options,
refreezing the poles is perhaps the most benign. There are, of course,
risks. Thorough impact assessments will be vital to minimise any harmful
effects on wildlife, local communities or wider Earth systems. But
[without action, the ice will disappear, destabilising the global
climate. Cuts to greenhouse gas emissions should have started decades
ago. The delay has left us with no time to be squeamish about
geoengineering]{.underline}.

### Climate Change - ! -\> Extinction

#### Unchecked climate change leads to extinction from extreme weather, food insecurity, and armed conflict.

industry\'s transition to a greener economy -- they have removed over 2
million GHG carbon quantified "when will climate change kill us all"
<https://www.oxia-initiative.com/blog-posts/when-will-climate-change-kill-us>\]
WB

[[As]{.mark} global [temperatures rise, sea levels climb, and extreme
weather]{.mark} events [become more frequent, one]{.mark} pressing
[question emerges]{.mark}: When [will climate change kill us]{.mark}?
While this is a stark and unsettling way to frame the issue, it reflects
the growing anxiety surrounding climate change's long-term impacts on
human survival. The question, however, is not as simple as asking for a
specific date or tipping point. Instead, the real question we should be
asking is: How much longer can we continue down this path before
irreversible damage occurs?]{.underline} To understand the potential
timelines of climate change\'s catastrophic effects, it's essential to
consider its gradual and cumulative impact on the environment,
ecosystems, and human society: **Climate change is already killing us**
[The grim reality is that climate change is already killing people,
particularly in vulnerable regions. [According to]{.mark} the World
Health Organization ([WHO]{.mark}), [climate change is responsible for
tens of thousands of deaths every year]{.mark}, due to extreme
heatwaves, floods, droughts, and the spread of diseases. The WHO
estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change could cause
approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, primarily from
malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.]{.underline} In recent
years, extreme heat events in Europe, India, and other parts of the
world led to thousands of excess deaths. Rising temperatures, in
combination with poor air quality, exacerbate cardiovascular and
respiratory conditions. At the same time, climate-driven natural
disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods are displacing millions
of people, putting lives at risk and causing both short-term and
long-term casualties. [The [acceleration of extreme weather
events]{.mark} [While individual extreme weather events are devastating,
climate change accelerates their frequency and intensity]{.mark}. Events
like hurricanes, typhoons, and floods are becoming more powerful due to
warmer oceans and changing weather patterns. This is evident from storms
such as Hurricane Harvey and Typhoon Haiyan, which caused significant
destruction and loss of life. Scientists warn that [as]{.mark} global
[temperatures rise]{.mark}, these [disasters will become more frequent
and deadlier]{.mark}. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
([IPCC) reports]{.mark} that with each degree of warming, the risk of
extreme weather events increases. Although not every storm, drought, or
flood directly results in death, the [cascading effects on
infrastructure, agriculture, and public health]{.mark} create long-term
vulnerabilities that [put millions of lives at risk]{.mark}. Food and
water scarcity [One of the]{.mark} less visible but equally [deadly
consequences of climate change is its impact on food and water security.
As rising temp]{.mark}eratures and shifting weather patterns [disrupt
agricultural production]{.mark}, many regions face [increased risks of
crop failures, droughts, and food shortages]{.mark}. [Famine and
malnutrition]{.mark}---particularly in poorer regions---[are becoming
more common]{.mark} as agricultural systems struggle to
adapt.]{.underline} Water scarcity is exacerbated by climate change.
Glaciers that feed major rivers are melting at alarming rates, while
droughts are depleting freshwater reserves. A lack of clean drinking
water, combined with food insecurity, can result in malnutrition,
dehydration, and conflict over resources, all of which contribute to
increased mortality rates. **Mass displacement and conflict** [[As
climate change makes]{.mark} certain [regions uninhabitable]{.mark},
[millions of people are being forced to migrate]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Rising sea levels are particularly concerning for low-lying island
nations and coastal cities. For example, places like the Maldives and
parts of Bangladesh are at serious risk of being submerged, forcing
entire populations to flee. The United Nations estimates that by 2050,
climate refugees could number over 200 million people. Mass displacement
can lead to overcrowded urban areas, strained infrastructure, and
limited access to healthcare and essential services. [[It]{.mark} also
[heightens the risk of conflict as people compete for dwindling
resources like food, water, and land]{.mark}. The combination of
[displacement]{.mark}, economic instability, and social unrest [can
result in civil wars, political instability, and increased mortality
rates]{.mark} due to violence and poor living conditions.]{.underline}
**When will we reach the \"point of no return\"?** Scientists fear that
certain climate tipping points---such as the melting of polar ice caps,
the collapse of rainforests, or the thawing of permafrost---could
trigger runaway climate change. This means that certain changes in the
climate system become self-perpetuating, accelerating global warming
beyond human control. One example is the melting of the Arctic ice cap.
As the ice melts, less sunlight is reflected back into space, and more
is absorbed by the Earth's surface, accelerating warming in a process
known as the albedo effect. Similarly, the thawing of permafrost could
release massive amounts of methane---a potent greenhouse gas---into the
atmosphere, further intensifying global warming. If these tipping points
are crossed, the climate could enter a feedback loop that makes
mitigating the damage nearly impossible. [While [scientists]{.mark} are
still debating the exact timing, some [argue that we could be only a few
decades away from reaching these points of no return if drastic measures
aren't taken.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Scientists say there are ample reasons to suspect global heating could
lead to catastrophe]{.mark}. [The risk of global societal collapse or
human extinction has been]{.mark} "dangerously [underexplored]{.mark}",
climate [scientists have warned]{.mark} in an analysis.]{.underline}
They call such a catastrophe the "climate endgame". Though it had a
small chance of occurring, given the uncertainties in future emissions
and the climate system, cataclysmic scenarios could not be ruled out,
they said."Facing a future of accelerating climate change while blind to
worst-case scenarios is naive risk management at best and fatally
foolish at worst," the scientists said, adding that there were "ample
reasons" to suspect global heating could result in an apocalyptic
disaster. The international team of experts argue the world needs to
start preparing for the possibility of the climate endgame. "Analysing
the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanise
action, improve resilience, and inform policy," they said. Explorations
in the 1980s of the nuclear winter that would follow a nuclear war
spurred public concern and disarmament efforts, the researchers said.
Th[[e analysis proposes a research agenda, including what they call the
"four horsemen" of the climate endgame: famine, extreme weather, war and
disease.]{.mark}]{.underline} They also called for the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change to produce a special report on the issue. The
IPCC report on the impacts of just 1.5C of heating drove a "groundswell
of public concern", they said. "[[There are plenty of reasons to believe
climate change could become catastrophic, even at modest levels of
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Dr Luke Kemp at the University of
Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, who led the
analysis. "[[Climate change has played a role in every mass extinction
event. It has helped fell empires and shaped
history]{.underline}]{.mark}. [["Paths to disaster are not limited to
the direct impacts of high temperatures, such as extreme weather events.
Knock-on effects such as financial crises, conflict and new disease
outbreaks could trigger other calamities."]{.mark}]{.underline} The
analysis is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences and was reviewed by a dozen scientists. It argues that the
consequences of global heating beyond 3C have been underexamined, with
few quantitative estimates of the total impacts. "We know least about
the scenarios that matter most," Kemp said A thorough risk assessment
would consider how risks spread, interacted and amplified, but had not
been attempted, the scientists said. "Yet this is how risk unfolds in
the real world," they said. "For example, a cyclone destroys electrical
infrastructure, leaving a population vulnerable to an ensuing deadly
heatwave." The Covid pandemic underlined the need to examine rare but
high-impact global risks, they added. Particularly concerning are
tipping points, where a small rise in global temperature results in a
big change in the climate, such as huge carbon emissions from an Amazon
rainforest suffering major droughts and fires. Tipping points could
trigger others in a cascade and some remained little studied, they said,
such as the abrupt loss of stratocumulus cloud decks that could cause an
additional 8C of global warming. [The [researchers warn that climate
breakdown could exacerbate or trigger other catastrophic risks, such as
international wars or infectious disease pandemics, and worsen existing
vulnerabilities such as poverty, crop failures and lack of
water.]{.mark}]{.underline} The analysis suggests superpowers may one
day fight over geoengineering plans to reflect sunlight or the right to
emit carbon.

will increase the future risk of violent armed conflict within
countries, according to a study published today in the journal *Nature.*
Synthesizing views across experts, the study estimates [[climate]{.mark}

impact on the risk of armed conflict. In a scenario with [[4 degrees
Celsius]{.mark} of [warming]{.mark} (approximately the path we're on if
societies do not substantially reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases),
the [influence of climate on conflicts would **increase more than five

conflict risk]{.mark}, according to the study. Even in a scenario of 2
degrees Celsius of warming beyond preindustrial levels -- the stated
goal of the Paris Climate Agreement­ -- the influence of climate on
conflicts would more than double, rising to a 13% chance.]{.underline}
"Appreciating the role of climate change and its security impacts is
important not only for understanding the social costs of our continuing
heat-trapping emissions, but for prioritizing responses, which could
include aid and cooperation," said [**Katharine

weather and related [disasters]{.mark} can **[damage economies, lower
farming and livestock production and intensify inequality]{.mark}**

and reduces both the amount and quality of food that can be grown. It
can take years for agricultural production to recover, which puts the
community at long-term risk of hunger as food supplies dwindle. In South
Sudan, floods destroy crops and do not recede quickly enough for farms

South Sudan are still submerged underwater. Yet in other parts of the
country, prolonged drought has rendered farmland dry and desolate.
**Global Warming Is Affecting the Most Vulnerable** The countries and

[When a climate disaster strikes, people who are already struggling with

families who are living on less than \$2 dollars a day, this loss forces
them to make difficult decisions just to survive -- whether that means
selling their remaining livestock or taking their kids out of school to
save money]{.underline}. Decisions like these save families money in the
short term, but they hurt their ability to access food in the future. As
climate change increases the frequency of these disasters, vulnerable
communities don't have enough time to recover and rebuild their
livelihoods before the next one hits. [They're [caught in a cycle of

### Disease Scenario -- ! - 2AC Add-On

#### Arctic warming is creating multiple vectors for major disease outbreaks -- shipping, animal migrations, and urban centers magnify the risk of an outbreak

Valerie **Brown**, 11/25/**24**, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
"A Rising danger in the Arctic,"
https://thebulletin.org/2024/11/a-rising-danger-in-the-arctic-microbes-unleashed-by-climate-change/#post-heading,
mm

[Arctic microbes]{.underline} are far more diverse and complex than the
few familiar viruses identified so far in frozen bodies that have
thawed, and they [present very real risks to humans]{.underline} and
other animals. Unlike Antarctica, [the Arctic is home to millions of
people]{.underline} (estimates range from four million to 13 million).
[Pathogens are moving]{.underline} both southward from and northward
[into Arctic regions through many routes]{.underline}, and people in the
Arctic are bearing the brunt of them. Indigenous residents and mobile
workers in mining and fossil fuel extraction industries face the most
immediate risks from the mingling of previously separated ecologies.
[Climate change]{.underline} also [promises to aggravate
zoonosis]{.underline}, or diseases that jump from animals to people (and
vice versa). Finally, there are risks from global atmospheric transport
of microbes and from gene exchanges among formerly separated microbial
populations that may create new diseases or worsen old ones. Climate
change has a clear and disturbing effect on infectious diseases. A 2022
study by University of Hawai'i ecologist Camilo Mora and colleagues
found that [of "375 infectious diseases documented to have impacted
humanity, 218 were found to be aggravated by climatic
hazards.]{.underline}" Warming, precipitation, floods, and drought
exacerbated 103 vector-borne, 78 waterborne, and 60 airborne diseases,
most caused by viruses and bacteria, with lesser involvement of fungi
and protozoans. And these were only diseases already known to science.
Climate change is dramatically affecting permafrost, a loose
conglomerate of rock, soil, plant matter, ice and microbes, with a thin
top layer that melts and refreezes seasonally; it covers about 25
percent of the Northern Hemisphere's land surface. Estimates of the
oldest permafrost in the northern hemisphere, in Siberia's Kolyma
region, range between one million and three million years. The combined
mass of continuous permafrost in the Arctic and Tibetan Plateau is
nearly 11 million square kilometers; by contrast, Antarctica's
permafrost covers at most about 71,000 km2. Russia is far and away the
possessor of the most Arctic permafrost, a fact that causes problems for
the rest of the world, given Russia's war aims and unwillingness to
share information. Humans living in the Arctic have in recent centuries
built their residences, businesses, and other infrastructure atop
permafrost, which served as a sort of perpetual foundation. Now, as
climate change proceeds, permafrost is collapsing across the North,
destroying water systems, roads, buildings, and pipelines and leading to
contamination of areas humans use. Permafrost collapse generates new
lakes that can join up with surface streams and carry microbes into the
ocean. Open-pit mines, eroded bluffs, and sinkholes expose ancient
organic matter. In addition to bacteria and viruses, fungi, lichens, and
even nematode worms have been revived from permafrost. So while there is
some reason to avoid panic about zombie microbes, humans do face the
possibility of meeting up with the vast, newly exposed microbial
storehouse released from permafrost. [Potential pathogens could move
into and out of the Arctic in multiple ways. Ships' ballast water
transports invasive species, including microbes]{.underline}. [Animal
carriers]{.underline}, especially rodents like beaver, rats and rabbits,
bring southern pathogens like giardia, rabies, toxoplasmosis, and
hantavirus northward, while marine mammals and birds [migrate great
distances]{.underline} north and south, traversing the Arctic, Pacific
and Atlantic oceans [distributing bacteria, viruses and
fungi]{.underline}. And [as resource extraction rises, more workers
move]{.underline} [between]{.underline} weeks-long shifts in [the Arctic
to urban areas]{.underline} in more southerly regions, often using air
transport. Mora compared several centuries' worth of climate change data
with a dataset related to epidemics. He found that climate influences
infectious diseases in several ways. "There has to be contact between
disease and person," he says. This happens where people are forced to
migrate into new environments because of "hurricanes, floods, and heat
waves." Also, Mora found, **[pathogens can become stronger in higher
latitudes]{.underline}** where milder winters enable them to survive
year-round and disasters degrade both public health protections and
people's immune responses in unaccustomed higher temperatures. All of
these circumstances are starting to affect the Arctic. [Increased
shipping and accelerating development]{.underline} are closely tied in
the Arctic and [present a significant risk for disease
spread.]{.underline} There is great interest in a trans-Arctic shipping
route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans because it could shave
five days off the current transit time through the Suez and Panama
Canals for voyages between Asia, Europe, and eastern North America.
Shipping interests eagerly anticipate the point when the trans-Arctic
sea routes are ice-free year-round. It\'s uncertain whether industrial
and commercial development in the Arctic will continue apace in the
short run. The Russia-Ukraine war has somewhat dampened enthusiasm for
trans-Arctic shipping, as have the ongoing threat of sea ice blockages
and problems maintaining land infrastructure crucial to both shipping
and oil and gas exploration, including pipelines. But absent some
reversal of climate warming or a global economic shock, shipping
activity in the Arctic is expected to only go up. Over the last decade,
Arctic shipping has certainly done so, as measured by overall ship
traffic, distances sailed, and the striking example of the Mary River
iron mine in Baffinland, where traffic in the nearby port of Milne Inlet
jumped 583 percent in five years. Ships move about 10 billion tons of
ballast water around the world annually. Ships typically dump their
ballast water, which helps maintain ship stability, in port and take in
new water for the next journey. [Expanded Arctic shipping brings with it
a severe threat of microbe exchange]{.underline} between more southerly
and Arctic waters. David Lodge, professor at Cornell's Atkinson Center
for Sustainability, has studied the explosion of invasive species in the
world's ports and coastlines. There is little data on the Arctic, so he
stresses he is speculating, but says, "I think ships are the more likely
way to bring quite novel organisms including microbes into the Arctic
and out of the Arctic." The Russian city of Murmansk is the port with
the highest risk of spreading invasive species, according to a 2016
paper by Notre Dame University computer scientist Mandana Saebi and
colleagues. Most of the Murmansk traffic moves between Russian ports and
those in Nordic countries. But many voyages also connect with ports to
the south; for example, some voyages stopping at Murmansk also visit
West African ports. This could exacerbate the spread of polar diseases
southward and move tropical diseases into regions with expanding human
presence that are rapidly losing permafrost and sea ice. [Tourist ships
can also be a source of microbe exchange]{.underline}. The Arctic
Council's shipping survey found that the number of cruise ships in the
Arctic jumped from 58 in 2013 to 96 in 2023, and cruise ships remain the
sixth largest ship type behind fishing and cargo ships. One experiment
found that antibiotic shoe wash placed where tourists moved on and off
their ship did not effectively reduce their shoes' microbial load. The
passengers in the study visited the Svalbard archipelago, where concerns
about microbial invasions affecting the terrestrial ecosystem are high.
Clearly, the more people move around, the higher the risk of disease
transmission. In the Arctic, the most mobile population is likely the
pool of extractive industry workers. A 2019 demographic atlas of the
Arctic found that "the highest share of working-age population was in
regions where a high proportion of employment is related to extracting
natural resources, e.g. oil, gas and minerals. This is especially the
case in the Russian Arctic regions." Some of these workers are
residents, but industrial activity bringing in "non-resident male worker
populations" is likely a pipeline for rapid dispersal of infectious
diseases. According to a 2019 analysis from University College London,
such transitory workers often live in "camp-like conditions" that
encourage "increased demand for commercial sex and, thereby, potentially
human trafficking." Because of the rapid travel patterns and cramped
living quarters typical of extractive operations, "you don't need a huge
dispersal of a pathogen," Mora says. You just need person-to-person
transmission in close quarters and one infected person to carry the
disease quickly to a more populated area. Greenland is a prime example
of the problem. It is already at high risk for pathogen exchange and on
the brink of massive expansion of resource extraction. The mineral
exploration company KoBold Metals, with investors who include Microsoft
founder Bill Gates, Amazon and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, and Ray
Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater
Associates, is exploring for nickel, copper, cobalt, and platinum group
metals in Greenland as the island's massive central ice sheet recedes.
Their goal is ostensibly to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon
economy. But, says Markus Kröger, professor of global development
studies at the University of Helsinki, extraction projects are also
pushing right up against the thawing permafrost and fostering the
creation of boom-bust towns, which are known breeding grounds for both
emerging and familiar diseases. Greenland is currently a hotspot for the
sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and gonorrhea, far outpacing the
Arctic regions of the United States and Canada. Neither KoBold Metals
nor the Gates Foundation responded to multiple requests for comment on
their Greenland efforts. [Along with shipping and development, there
is]{.underline} a third major disease pipeline into and out of the
world's Arctic regions: [zoonosis]{.underline}. [Some 60 percent of
known and 75 percent of emerging human pathogens have jumped from other
animals to humans]{.underline}. In lower latitudes, bird flu has already
jumped from birds to cattle and from cattle to humans. Cats and dogs
have also been exposed. In the Arctic, domestic animals are already
known to have exchanged pathogens with marine mammals. Ashley
Barratclough, a veterinarian with the National Marine Mammal Foundation
in San Diego, studies disease transmission among Arctic mammals. She is
concerned about Pacific orca, for example, traveling farther into the
Arctic Ocean as waters warm to prey on bowhead whales. She says,
"Climate change \[is\] opening up for the first time for these species
to interact and \[for their diseases to\] cross over. That to me is a
much bigger concern than the ice melting \[and\] releasing a pathogen
from a dead body. We often refer to marine mammals as the sentinels of
the ocean, and it's a matter of time before they're going to be
affecting people." The place to monitor the danger, she says, is among
subsistence hunters and herders, who are the frontline humans at most
risk from zoonosis. Herders are especially vulnerable in the Nordic
Arctic and Russia's vast permafrost region. The wild unpredictability of
[zoonosis]{.underline} is one of the reasons it [keeps]{.underline} many
[infectious disease experts up at night]{.underline}. A potential brake
on it, says Barratclough, is that a pathogen---say, bird flu---jumping
species may become "deadly in one species but not necessarily the
other." For example, she adds, "Influenza can be highly pathogenic in
birds but not necessarily in marine mammals." This also might be true
for humans but is not certain and cannot be taken for granted for all
diseases. [Wildfires are]{.underline} a major source of atmospheric
particulates, and they are sharply [increasing]{.underline} in size and
ferocity globally. Climate change will amplify the Arctic's contribution
to this phenomenon. Romanovsky, the Alaska-based geophysicist, says
wildfires can easily rage on top of permafrost. In a 2013 study he and
his colleagues observed that wildfires can accelerate warming and
irreversibly degrade permafrost. This causes something of a feedback
loop that will catapult more material into the atmosphere. Somewhat
counterintuitively, [wildfires are efficient microbe
transporters]{.underline}. Bacteria are not necessarily killed by fires,
and they even survive the updrafts of hot air surrounding wildfires.
Viruses (not technically alive) also hitch rides. Anna Bruhn's master's
thesis in geography from Sweden's Lund University examined whether
ancient microbes emerging from permafrost and ice might move between
Greenland and continental Europe via the atmosphere. Greenland is still
mostly ice, but it has seen numerous wildfires in the last 15 years.
These have exploded in rapidly degrading permafrost, according to a
study by Romanovsky. Bruhn was surprised by her conclusion that microbes
easily travel in wildfire smoke. "I didn't think it would be so
real-world applicable, because I thought if these diseases are going to
emerge, they're more likely to spread on a plane to Copenhagen," she
says.

[The devastating impact of]{.underline} [COVID-19 has highlighted global
vulnerabilities]{.underline} [to high-consequence biological events. The
international community was woefully unprepared for a pandemic that has
led to millions of
deaths]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [trillions]{.underline} [of
dollars]{.underline} [in economic losses, and has upended daily life.
However, notwithstanding the severe damage caused
by]{.underline} [COVID-19, it]{.underline} [should be viewed as a
warning shot.1]{.underline} [It will not be the last

next]{.underline} [high-consequence biological event could be as
destructive
or]{.underline} [substantially]{.underline} [worse.]{.underline}

 

[We define]{.underline} [global catastrophic biological
risks]{.underline} [(GCBRs) as biological events of tremendous scale
that could]{.underline} [cause severe damage]{.underline} [to human
civilization, potentially jeopardizing its
long-term]{.underline} [survival.]{.underline}2 The Johns Hopkins Center

could]{.underline} [arise from]{.underline} [a variety of sources,
including]{.underline} [nuclear war, anthropogenic]{.underline} [climate
change,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [advanced]{.underline} [artificial]{.underline} [intelligence
that has not been sufficiently
safeguarded.]{.underline}4,5 [GCBRs]{.underline} [could be caused by a
naturally emerging infectious disease outbreak, an accidental release of
a pathogen, or a deliberate attack. Naturally emerging
infectious]{.underline} [disease outbreaks that can grow into pandemics
are likely]{.underline} [to increase
in]{.underline} [frequency]{.underline} [due
to]{.underline} [urbanization, globalization,

the tools of modern bioscience and biotechnology.]{.underline}6-8 Not
all outbreaks or global pandemics will grow to the scale of a GCBR as we
define it in this article and as others have defined global catastrophic
risks more broadly, because the threshold for this type of event is
extremely high.

[Although]{.underline} [COVID-19 does not rise to the level of a
GCBR-scale event, it
has]{.underline} [demonstrated]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [a
biological]{.underline} [event can have a]{.underline} [devastating

### Disease Scenario -- Arctic Warming -\> Disease

#### As the Arctic warms, bacteria are released from permafrost- this would prove deadly to humans 

**UNEP '25** \[United Nations Environment Program, January 7, UNEP is

In the unusually hot summer of 2016, [a **bacterium** that causes
**anthrax** **killed** more than **2,500 reindeer** in Siberia's remote
Yamal Peninsula]{.underline}, according to [one
study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.668420/full). 

**[Normally]{.underline}** locked deep in a layer of permanently frozen
land, or permafrost, [the once-**dormant** pathogen eventually **spread
to humans**]{.underline}, claiming the life of a 12-year-old boy and
causing **[dozens of others to fall ill.]{.underline}**  

Some researchers believe [the **outbreak** is a **sign** of things to
come]{.underline}. As climate change **[rapidly]{.underline}** warms the
Artic, scientists say it could [**unleash** a wave of potentially
**deadly** microbes that for centuries have been **trapped in
ice**]{.underline}. 

That threat is being highlighted in [**Navigating New

report from the [United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the
International Science Council that explores emerging **challenges** to
planetary health and **human wellbeing**.    ]{.underline}

"The fact that these microbes are present in the permafrost means it's
[**hard** to say how **widespread**, or **dangerous**, this problem
could be]{.underline}," says Andrea Hinwood, UNEP's Chief Scientist.
"But there are reasons to be concerned."  

The Arctic, which spans [14 million square kilometers across eight
countries]{.underline}, is [covered by a layer of **thick
permafrost**]{.underline}, a frozen mixture of soil, rocks, ice and
organic material. However, [the Arctic is warming **four times faster**
than the rest of the globe, with thawing permafrost potentially
**setting free ancient bacteria and viruses**]{.underline}, [experts
say](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3). According
to [a
study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352004313_Climate_change_melting_cryosphere_and_frozen_pathogens_Should_we_worry) in
the journal **[Environmental Sustainability]{.underline}**, an estimated
[**four sextillion** microbes]{.underline} -- that's a four with 21
zeros -- are [released **annually** due to thawing
permafrost]{.underline}. 

Some researchers are especially worried about the [thawing of
**long-dead** Arctic animals, whose bodies may house **dormant**
microbes]{.underline}. The Siberian outbreak was traced to a reindeer
burial ground; many of those animals died more than 70 years ago from
anthrax. 

Hinwood says what is playing out in the [Artic has taken place in warmer
climates for **centuries**, with pathogens hopping between people and
animals, often with **deadly results**.  ]{.underline}

"This is not a new phenomenon but it's happening in a new place." As
warming opens the Artic to shipping, mining and other industries,
Hinwood says that could put more [people in **close proximity** to
thawed permafrost and its **resident microbes**]{.underline}. 

"We could be witnessing a **[complete change]{.underline}** of land use
in the Arctic and that could be **[dangerous]{.underline}**," she said. 

[The spread of disease isn't the **only problem** with the **thawing**
of the Arctic.]{.underline}

And these were **only diseases** already **known to

[Climate change is **dramatically**

a loose conglomerate of rock, soil, plant matter, ice and microbes, with

a fact that causes problems for the rest of the world, given Russia's
war aims and unwillingness to share information.

[[Humans]{.underline}]{.mark} living [[in the Arctic
have]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent centuries [[built their residences,
businesses, and other infrastructure atop permafrost, which served as a
sort of]{.mark} **perpetual foundation**]{.underline}. Now, as [[climate

## Arctic Conflict Advantage

### Arctic Race -- Will Happen

#### Melting sea ice will lead to massive commercial development -- countries are now by preparing by scaling up infrastructure and their military presence

New Trade Routes and Geopolitical Flashpoints,"

mm

The Ukraine war has refashioned alliances, isolating Russia from the
West and pushing Moscow and Beijing to closer cooperation. Citing
national security, the U.S. and allies are securitizing trade policies
with China, restricting access to key developing technologies and
friend-shoring critical supply chains. In what some foreign policy
experts are calling a new Cold War, geopolitical competition between
western liberal democracies and the China-Russia authoritarian axis is
super-charging a race to shape technology standards, economic rules of
the road and political norms of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. [The
Arctic Circle]{.underline}, once the isolated habitat of polar bears,
rich marine life and small indigenous communities, [is now being drawn
into the realm of geopolitics, with melting polar ice caps promising to
open its waters to navigation and tensions]{.underline}. The Arctic
region has been warming four times faster than the rest of the world
over the past four decades, according to a 2022 study by Finnish and
Norwegian scientists. [Scientists are projecting that by 2035, parts of
the Arctic will be free of ice during summer months]{.underline},
opening up prospects for commercial shipping to ply these waters and
shorten transit time between the U.S., Europe and Asia. Some studies
project that Arctic routes could be 30% to 50% shorter than the Suez
Canal and Panama Canal routes, with transit time reduced by an estimated
14 to 20 days. Beyond commercial shipping, the new routes could attract
cruise ships and adventure tourists. [Access]{.underline} not only
[creates]{.underline} [opportunities]{.underline} for the maritime
sector, but [the region is rich in fossil fuels, critical minerals and
marine life.]{.underline} Commercial industries potentially will gain
access to billions of dollars of untapped resources. Unlike Antarctica,
a land mass, [there is no treaty protecting the Arctic from
international development.]{.underline} [This makes control]{.underline}
over the waterways and natural resources [ripe for]{.underline} dispute
and potential [conflict]{.underline}. [The race to build
infrastructure]{.underline} to support and control navigation [has
already begun]{.underline}. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) was first
opened by the Soviet Union in the 1930s but has not been a reliable
transit route due to ice coverage. Climate change is changing that.
Russia claims that the NSR lies within its territorial waters, giving it
exclusive rights to develop the area and patrol ships. The U.S. and
other countries dispute this claim, saying it runs through international
waters. Seeing the emerging opportunity, [Russia has been refurbishing
more than 50 Soviet bases]{.underline}, providing them with strategic
ports and sending a political message that the NSR is under Russian
sovereignty. Canada claims the Northwest Passage (NWP) is located in
internal Canadian waters and subject to Canadian law and sovereignty.
The U.S. and Europe disagree, arguing it also is an international strait
and subject to freedom of navigation under the Law of the Sea. To date,
there are very few ports along the NWP, with Churchill being the only
deep-water port with shelter and berthing facilities. There are no
deep-water ports along the North Slope of Alaska or throughout the
Canadian Archipelago. But this is changing. [The U.S. has plans to build
its first deep-water Arctic port in]{.underline} Nome,
[Alaska]{.underline}, and Canada is planning a deep-water port in
Qikiqtarjuaq, Nanuvut, which is located at the entrance to the NWP. [The
Trans-Arctic Route]{.underline}, which cuts straight across the North
Pole, avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in
international high seas. Currently, and probably [until
mid-century,]{.underline} it [is only navigable by nuclear
icebreakers]{.underline}. But the [possibilities are being discussed
today]{.underline}, **[foreseeing thousands of ships a year passing
between North America and Asia]{.underline}**, with a hub at Alaska's
Dutch Harbor. The ships would not have size restrictions, as the Central
Arctic Ocean's depth is not as limiting as the NSR and NWP. The Biden
administration released its National Strategy for the Arctic Region in
October 2022. It has four pillars: national security, economic
development, infrastructure development, and environment. National
security is the first priority. In light of Russia's full invasion of
Ukraine, the strategy cites the requirement to protect the homeland and
ensure that the Arctic region is peaceful, with guardrails to manage
competition and resolve disputes without force or coercion. The strategy
also draws attention to China's efforts to increase its influence in the
Arctic, doubling its investments with a focus on critical mineral
extraction and using scientific engagements to conduct dual-use research
in military or intelligence applications in the Arctic. These worries
are not purely theoretical. The military balance in the Arctic is
heavily weighted towards Russia. It has more bases than NATO and is
upgrading air strips to improve operability. Russia's icebreaker fleet
vastly outnumbers NATO states, even with the addition of Finland.
Despite the Ukraine War, Russia is continuing to invest, maintain and
exercise its forces in its Northern Region, which is home to many
Russian strategic military assets (ballistic missile submarines,
strategic test sites, advance radar systems, etc.). The shortest
distances for a Russian missile or bomber attack against the U.S. is
over the polar cap. China also seeks to become a polar great power.
Beijing has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," claiming rights to
freedom of navigation and overflight, scientific research, fishing, and
resource development. China's intelligence-gathering activities became
front page news this year with the detection and eventual downing of a
Chinese balloon first detected near St. Matthew Island in the Bering
Sea. Moscow has historically pushed back against Beijing's interest in
the Arctic to protect its sensitive military assets. However, the war in
Ukraine has changed the strategic landscape. In June, Russian and
Chinese vessels conducted a joint exercise near Alaska's Aleutian
Islands. The U.S. Coast Guard warned the ships off when they entered
U.S.-regulated waters. The U.S. military views this as a test of U.S.
readiness. Since then, there have been other Russian-Chinese patrols in
the area, and the U.S. has made a show of tracking them. [While
commercial opportunities remain over the horizon]{.underline},
[geopolitics will play an important role in determining what the
opportunities are and for whom]{.underline}.

#### Economic interests will drive a development race in the melting Arctic

Martin **Virba**, 1/14/25, Green European Journal, "The Race for the
Melting Arctic,"
https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/the-race-for-the-melting-arctic/, mm

Following Donald Trump's remarks about a possible US annexation of
Greenland, [the High North has come under renewed international focus.
Climate change and geopolitical tensions are driving a new race for the
region]{.underline}, [increasing the militarisation of the
Arctic]{.underline} and making it a key focus of predatory "green
capitalism". The melting ice is revealing hidden dangers, and what
happens in the Arctic doesn't stay there. "[Everyone wants to bite off
somewhere]{.underline} or to bite off something from us. But they should
know that we will knock out everyone's teeth so that they cannot bite."
This was the response Vladimir Putin gave in 2021 to American criticism
of Russian naval and military expansion in the Arctic. It made clear
that for Russia, the Arctic is a region of strategic importance that
Moscow is willing to fight for using any means necessary. [The
Arctic]{.underline}, once a remote and largely untouched region, [is
increasingly becoming a focal point of international interest and
geopolitical tensions]{.underline}. Of course, struggles for control of
the Arctic are nothing new. Historically, the region often mirrored the
strategic manoeuvring of superpowers and minor countries with
territorial claims, thus making it a microcosm of global geopolitical
dynamics. The bipolar structure of Arctic geopolitics dominated by US
and Soviet interests during the Cold War became largely unipolar after
the fall of the Soviet Union. Now it's evolving further as Russia and
China become more assertive in pursuing their interests. [Given the
extreme climate conditions, the region may seem unattractive at first
sight]{.underline}, [but a closer look unveils its vital importance for
modern economies]{.underline} from the 18th century onwards. Interest in
the Arctic goes back at least to the 1730s, when expeditions by Dutch
and English explorers around Spitzberg Island opened the door to
commercial whaling. In the 20th century, attention shifted towards oil
and natural gas extraction as the region proved rich in resources vital
for fossil fuel economies. That is most striking in the case of Russia.
The Arctic makes up some 28 per cent of the Russian landmass, and it's
also where the majority of Russian oil and gas production is located. In
2022 alone, "Russia's production of Arctic oil and gas amounted to some
10.65 million barrels of oil equivalent per day," according to Statista,
making it "the largest producer across the globe," followed by Norway
and the US. But the future of the Arctic lies elsewhere.

**[rush for resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's also a place where a
new **[battleground is emerging]{.underline}**, with the world's
superpowers gearing up to take each other on in a mad dash for control
and strategic superiority. As the Arctic region undergoes unprecedented
changes due to climate change, **[the [melting of]{.mark} the
[ice]{.mark} is [opening]{.mark} up a world of [possibilities]{.mark}
and the big [powers know it]{.mark} -- and they're hungry for it. As the
[Arctic contains]{.mark} about [30 percent of the world's natural gas
supplies and 15 percent of oil]{.mark}, not to mention all those metals
and rare earths, a huge treasure trove of previously untapped natural
resources awaits. New trade routes are also opening up with more
planned]{.underline}**. On a visit to Norway and Iceland last week David
Lammy, Britain's foreign secretary, summed it all up: "The
**[[Arctic]{.mark} is fast [becoming an area of intense focus]{.mark}
for geopolitical [competition]{.mark} and a [key]{.mark} flank of NATO's
defences]{.underline}**," he told reporters.
"**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been **[[building
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** its military presence here for years.
**[[As]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[ice]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the

threats in the region."

But it **[[hasn't always been like this]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Back in
1987, the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev launched a series of policy
initiatives aimed at lowering the level of military confrontation in the
Arctic by creating cooperation among the eight Arctic states: Canada,
Denmark (via Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and
the United States. This gave birth to a new strategic environment in the
region -- an "Arctic Exceptionalism", that until **[[recent
years]{.underline}]{.mark}** endured in part
**[[because]{.underline}]{.mark}** these countries share **[[common
regional interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Their interactions were
supported by a range of robust institutional frameworks, from the Arctic
Council to the Barents Euro-Arctic Council. Following Vladimir
Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, however, all scientific cooperation
with Russia was discontinued and in March 2022 the Arctic Council's work
was paused. Pessimism about its future increased when President Donald
Trump launched his own attack on science through mass firings, cuts in
funding, and limitations to research and education.

**[Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, two of the Arctic
countries, Sweden and Finland, applied to join NATO as a way of
protecting themselves from potential Russian aggression]{.underline}**.
So now **[[seven of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[Arctic states are
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** members, which has led to sharp **[[uplift
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** geopolitical **[[tensions between Russia and
the others]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russia, however, is still the
dominant power in the region, both in terms of geography and resources
-- its Arctic coastline of 24,140km spans more than half of the total.
The **[[Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been **[[pouring
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}** into the region in recent years, such as
nuclear icebreakers, new ports and research stations, all **[[seen as
essential for Russia's security]{.underline}]{.mark}** and economic
interests in promoting itself as a great power. Since 2013, for example,
**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
**[[reopened]{.underline}]{.mark}** or built more than a **[[dozen
Arctic military bases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including key sites such
as Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya and other Siberian islands, all
supporting air, land and sea operations. The new or reconstructed ports
of Tiksi, Dikson, Pevek and Sabetta, in addition to the long-established
Murmansk and Archangel, are all part of Russia's Northern Sea Route
(NSR) project, aimed at **[[boosting trade and creating new economic
opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Much of this infrastructure
redevelopment is financed by China, which also provides Russia with
technology and expertise.

This NSR, known as Russia's 'Arctic Silk Road', is crucial to both
Moscow and Beijing as it offers the potential to shorten transit times
between Europe and Asia. The journey from Asia to Europe will be just 19
days, far shorter than the 48 days it normally takes ships to go from
China to Europe's largest port in Rotterdam. Without doubt, the most
impressive infrastructure Russia is currently building is the megaport
on the **[Arctic [Taymyr peninsula]{.mark}, formerly [frozen]{.mark} for
[nine months]{.mark} of the year and [now less than six]{.mark}. Dubbed
the biggest project in the modern-day global oil industry, this \$110BN
facility will house [Russia's]{.mark} [largest Arctic oil
terminal]{.mark} and is so huge and so remote that the state-owned oil
company Rosneft is having to build extensive infrastructure just to get
to the site. New highways, two airports, 15 villages and several
electricity plants are being developed to get the construction off the
ground and house the 400,000 workers that are needed to make it all
happen. Russia is also building a 770km pipeline to transport oil to the
port, where 10 new ice-class tankers will take it on the remainder of
its journey to Europe and Asia.\
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}** also has long-term plans to become a polar
superpower and has declared itself a '**[[near-Arctic'
state]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even though its northernmost
regional capital is on the same latitude as Italy's Venice! Beijing
first positioned itself in the Arctic more than 20 years ago when it
**[[established a scientific research facility]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the Yellow River Station, deep inside the Arctic circle on Norway's
Svalbard archipelago, one of the world's northernmost inhabited areas.
Only 500 miles from the north pole, Svalbard has 24-hrs of daylight in
summer and zero in winter! It's also a hotspot microcosm of geopolitical
tensions. The archipelago is Norwegian, but is governed by a treaty
allowing people from all countries assigned to it to work visa free,
mainly in mines and scientific research. Svalbard is harmonious in
theory, but since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine there's been a
noticeable flexing of nationalistic muscle. Military parades have taken
place in the Russian settlement and there's a growing suspicion that the
Chinese have made their research station dual purpose for military
espionage.

Deeply suspicious of China's intentions, the European Arctic is
beginning to reject China's 'purchase-your-way-into-the-Arctic'
approach, as Beijing discovered when it tried to buy seaports from
Norway and Sweden. China's offer to buy an airport in Greenland was also
turned down. Andreas Osthagen, a senior fellow at the independent
Fridjof Nansen Institute in Lysaker Norway, describes the Arctic as
'low-hanging fruit' for **[[Russia-Chinese
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "**[[Russia needs
investments]{.underline}]{.mark}** and commercial actors who are
interested in developing the Arctic LNG resources, or developing a
northern sea route as a shipping lane", he told the BBC last week.
"**[[China is that]{.underline}]{.mark}** market. The two countries are
looking for ways to expand their political, economic, and even military
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**".\
Before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia actually tried to
limit China from extending its superior military-industrial capability
and scale into the Arctic, and even worked within the Arctic Council to
help keep China in check. Putin's aggression changed all that. The
reeling Russian economy is growing more dependent on the Chinese
industrial, technological and financial power and Moscow is now
Beijing's junior partner. **[[Xi Jinping]{.underline}]{.mark}** is also
taking advantage of Russia's isolation to gain more opportunities to
**[[exploit Russia's extensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arctic
**[[coastline]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[absorb]{.underline}]{.mark}**
its energy and mineral **[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, develop its
polar science and technological capabilities, and **[[expand its
military reach]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a result,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** now strongly
**[[supports]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s
Arctic ambitions, diplomatically and economically, creating a strategic
partnership to **[[counterbalance Western
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region.

The **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** is desperately **[[trying to catch
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region, having closed down numerous
bases and curtailed its military operations in the Arctic after the Cold
War. Much of its **[[infra]{.underline}]{.mark}**structure was
**[[neglected]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the years and nowadays it
struggles to keep even one heavy icebreaker afloat, by comparison with
China's three and Russia's forty. In 2021, the US and Canada agreed to
give **[[new life to]{.underline}]{.mark}** their joint North American
Aerospace Defence Command in order to
**[[counterbalance]{.underline}]{.mark}** the mounting
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** from Russia and China.\
Inevitably, Donald Trump has waded into the argument with his fixation
on Greenland, where the US keeps forces operating out of the Thule Air
Base. This northernmost US asset plays a critical role in early missile
warning and space surveillance. An autonomous territory within the
Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland's location between North America and
Europe makes it strategically important. Trump's obsession is all about
obtaining a "counterbalance" to the growing collaboration between the
US's most consequential adversaries, Russia and China. "You have Russian
ships all over the place," he said in an interview recently. "They are
sailing all over Canada, they are sailing right next to Greenland. We're
not going to let that happen". Trump's interest in Greenland became
widely known in 2019 when reports surfaced that he wanted to buy the
world's largest island from Denmark, the idea he reactivated in Trump
2.0, which Denmark quickly rejected.

With **[[rivalry for resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, vital shipping
lanes and military supremacy, the **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
quickly **[[changing into a disputed geopolitical
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the absence of defined methods to
handle these tensions, the region runs the risk of turning into a hot
spot for future hostilities. These are times of **[[big
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** politics and countries **[[increasingly act
in their own interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With so many **[[rival
nations now]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic, the risks of
miscalculation or [[misinterpretation are high]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Arctic Exceptionalism is clearly dead.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### [Following Donald Trump's remarks about a possible US annexation of Greenland, [the High North has come under]{.mark} [renewed international focus. Climate change and geopolitical tensions are driving a]{.mark} new [race]{.mark} for the region, [increasing the militarisation]{.mark} of the Arctic and making it a key focus of predatory "green capitalism]{.underline}". The melting ice is revealing hidden dangers, and what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay there. "Everyone wants to bite off somewhere or to bite off something from us. But they should know that we will knock out everyone's teeth so that they cannot bite." [This](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2021-05-20/putin-fires-back-at-us-arctic-concerns-we-will-knock-out-everyones-teeth) was the response Vladimir Putin gave in 2021 to American criticism of Russian naval and military expansion in the Arctic[. It made clear that [for Russia, the Arctic is a region of strategic importance]{.mark} that [Moscow is willing to fight]{.mark} for using any means necessary]{.underline}. The Arctic, once a remote and largely untouched region, is increasingly becoming a focal point of international interest and geopolitical tensions. Of course, struggles for control of the Arctic are nothing new. [Historically, the region often mirrored the strategic manoeuvring of superpowers and minor countries with territorial claims, thus making it a microcosm of global geopolitical dynamics.]{.underline} The bipolar structure of Arctic geopolitics dominated by US and Soviet interests during the Cold War became largely unipolar after the fall of the Soviet Union. [Now [it's evolving further as Russia and China become more assertive in pursuing their interests]{.mark}.

[The [Arctic has long been a potential arena for]{.mark} war, especially
[nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. American and Russian submarines
stationed there boast intercontinental ballistic missiles and act as
strategic nuclear deterrents. [For Moscow, [the Kola Peninsula]{.mark}
in Russia's far north-west forms [a gateway for]{.mark} vessels from its
massive fleet of mainly [nuclear-powered submarines]{.mark}. Through the
so-called GIUK gap, the gap between Greenland, Iceland and the UK,
Russia's subs can reach the Atlantic]{.underline}. Should the Kremlin
ever fire cruise missiles toward North America, they would fly over the
Arctic[. Likewise, Canada and America's warning system, stretching from
Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador, would pick up the attack in the
Arctic. And, partly to atone for missing the Chinese surveillance
balloon that reached Alaska in January this year, America and Canada are
set to build new Arctic-scanning radar bases in the north-western US and
Ontario.]{.underline} The main aim of which will be to detect the new
hypersonic cruise missiles that Russia has already used in Ukraine and
could one day fire at Canada and America, via the North Pole. [[The
Arctic is also the site of potential]{.mark} non-nuclear [disputes
between Russia and NATO members]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Kremlin's
feared 200th Motor Rifle Brigade is located only a few kilometres from
Russia's short border with Norway and its much longer one with Finland.
Other Russian marines are also based in the region, including the
spetsnaz (special forces). Both units have suffered severe losses in
Ukraine, but their location and their likely future revival continue to
worry Norway. After all, over in Ukraine, at least seven soldiers from
the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade are wanted for war crimes[. [There have
already been potential flashpoints]{.mark}. When [Moscow invaded
Ukraine, Norway blocked Russian exports]{.mark} to Svalbard, a Norwegian

### AT No Russia/China Axis

#### A Russia/Sino axis in the Arctic is growing -- infrastructure projects and military cooperation

András **Rácz** **and** Alina **Hrytsenko**, 6/16/**25**, Center for
European Policy Analysis, "Partnership Short of Alliance: Military
Cooperation Between Russia and China,"

mm

[[As Russia and China continue to]{.mark} [deepen]{.mark} [their]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} [partnership]{.mark},]{.underline} Western nations
must reassess their strategic posture. [[The fusion of Russian
tech]{.mark}nology [with China's manufacturing]{.mark} capabilities [is
accelerating Beijing's military modernization]{.mark}, potentially
shifting the balance of power in key regions]{.underline}. The
Chinese-produced dual-use vehicles and drones used by the Russian
military mentioned above are demonstrative examples of this phenomenon.
[[The]{.mark} [partnership]{.mark} between Russia and China]{.underline}
[[extends]{.underline}]{.mark} far beyond land and sea --- it reaches
[[into the]{.mark} icy expanse of the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[For Beijing, Russia serves as the gateway]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the
northern]{.underline} waters, unlocking access to a region of immense
strategic value. [While economic and trade opportunities drive China's
Arctic ambitions, [its presence there signals]{.mark} something far
greater]{.underline}: **[[a bid for global
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China's interest in the Arctic is not
merely about developing the Polar Silk Road or expanding scientific
research. In the long run, [Beijing seeks a deeper strategic foothold,
one that could include joint-use military and logistical bases with
Russia]{.underline}. [As climate change reshapes the Arctic landscape,
opening new maritime routes and resource frontiers, the region is poised
to become an arena where geopolitics, security, and great-power
competition converge]{.underline}. [For China, strengthening military
and logistical cooperation with Russia in the Arctic is]{.underline}
more than a pragmatic choice --- it is [a declaration of its rising
influence on the world stage]{.underline}. Moreover, the prospect of
joint-use military and logistical bases is becoming more tangible. [[As
climate change accelerates]{.mark} the opening of Arctic Sea routes,
[these facilities could support naval operations, strategic aviation,
and even submarine deployments]{.mark}. [This would]{.mark} not only
[bolster Russia's and China's military capabilitie]{.mark}s but also
challenge Western dominance in one of the world's last unclaimed
frontiers]{.underline}. In addition, [[there have been several cases
indicating that Russia and China might]{.mark} well [be cooperating
against NATO]{.mark} in the field of low-intensity, deniable
operations]{.underline}. This, so far, has primarily affected critical
infrastructure. In October 2023, the Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese ship
operated by a Russian crew, damaged a gas pipeline and two undersea data
cables in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor on the seabed.20 China
admitted its responsibility almost a year later, in August 2024.21 In
November 2024, another Chinese ship commanded by a Russian captain, the
Yi Peng 3, cut another cable under the Baltic Sea. In January 2025, a
Chinese cargo ship damaged underwater cables around Taiwan. While so far
no evidence has been published about any Moscow-Beijing cooperation
behind these incidents, it is clear that both adopted similar tactics,
namely to use civilian ships to damage critical infrastructure.20

#### Russia and China are deepening cooperation in the Arctic -- this heightens the risk of accidental conflict 

\[A.K. Chaun **Chen** April 4, 20**23.** Assistant professor of art
history received his Ph.D. in art history from Stanford University,
China-Russia Arctic Cooperation in the Context of a Divided Arctic. The
arctic institute
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/china-russia-arctic-cooperation-context-divided-arctic/\] 

 

Before February 2022, although **[the geopolitical conflict between
Russia and the West had]{.underline}** become increasingly fierce, it
had little **[impact on the relationship between Russia and the West in
the Arctic region.]{.underline}** Cooperation in the Arctic region has
been regarded as a relatively stable area of international cooperation
with common global interests. 

 Until Russia launched military action against Ukraine in 2022,
increasing geopolitical tensions did not stop Arctic states'
collaboration under the Arctic Council. However, with the continuation
of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the future of Arctic cooperation
seems to be splitting. The landmark event is that on March 3, 2022, the
Arctic 7 issued a joint statement, announcing the suspension of
cooperation with Russia in the Arctic Council. 

 In the view of many observers, this suspension will last for years or
even decades. 

[ **Russia** did not pay much attention to the isolation of the seven
countries in the Arctic, but focused on its own domestic Arctic affairs,
**sought to cooperate with China, and actively invited China to
participate in Russia's Arctic development projects.**]{.underline} 

 

Facing Russia's enthusiasm for seeking Arctic cooperation, China has
also responded positively to Russia's intention to deepen cooperation in
the Arctic. It has not only further strengthened its energy cooperation
with Russia, but also opened cooperation in various new areas, such as
Arctic shipping. With regard to the suspension of the Arctic Council,
China also publicly stated that it would not recognize the Arctic
Council without Russia. Benefiting from the confrontation between Russia
and the other seven countries in the Arctic, China has more
opportunities to carry out Arctic cooperation with Russia than ever
before. But in the face of the increasingly divided Arctic, will the
path of China-Russia cooperation in the Arctic really be smooth? How
should China adjust its direction of Arctic cooperation with all Arctic
states? 

 

Russia's Arctic cooperation is facing an unprecedentedly complex and
difficult situation. At present, Russia is suffering from various
sanctions imposed by the United States, NATO allies and the European
Union, and the support of these countries and alliances for Ukraine's
funds and weapons also makes Russia face increasing pressure at home and
abroad. At the same time, the official contact between Arctic 7 and
Russia has been closed, and Arctic 7 in the Arctic have suspended their
Arctic cooperation with Russia and taken practical actions. For example,
the Nordic Council of Ministers announced the suspension of regional
cooperation between the Nordic countries and Russia, Greenland stopped
the exchange of fishery quotas with Russia, Norway followed the European
Council and joined the sanctions of restrictive measures against Russia,
and so on.  Of the Arctic 7, only Finland and Sweden are not NATO
countries. But now, Finland and Sweden are also applying to join NATO.
If the application is approved, there will be a new geopolitical
alliance among the Arctic countries, forming a situation in which NATO's
Arctic 7 confronts Russia. 

  

This will pose **[a huge threat to Russia's Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}**. Because in many Arctic affairs, what Russia
is facing is no longer a single Arctic country, but NATO's Arctic
alliance, which will weaken Russia's bargaining power for cooperation
and affect Russia's initiative and interests in Arctic cooperation. On
the other hand, given Russia has long been wary and hostile to NATO
expansion, it **[is]{.underline}** hard to imagine that in the face of
**[NATO]{.underline}**'s Arctic alliance, Russia can still trust Arctic
countries such as Finland and Sweden as it did in the past. Thus, for
Russia's Arctic development, Russia urgently needs to find reliable
partners from non-western countries and non-NATO countries. In this
case, **[China is undoubtedly the only right partner for Russia's Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}**. China has a strong financial and technical
force, has a high enthusiasm for the development of the Arctic, and has
a long-term cooperative relationship with Russia. 

 

For China, deepening Arctic cooperation with Russia benefits its own
interests in terms of economy, energy security, and political influence
in the Arctic. But the question is, on the one hand, how long can the
good time of Sino-Russian cooperation promoted by short-term external
conflicts last? On the other hand, this deepening of **[China-Russia
cooperation is taking place under the background of the Arctic split.
The deeper the cooperation with Russia, the more likely it is to cause
misunderstanding and vigilance of other Arctic countries, which may lead
to mistrust of China by other Arctic countries and even trigger
confrontation between China and other Arctic countries.]{.underline}**
Moreover, as a non-Arctic country, China's many activities in the Arctic
cannot be separated from the support and cooperation of the Arctic
countries. In the long run, only a peaceful and stable Arctic is in the
interests of non-Arctic countries and so is China's political and
economic interests. China needs to balance its relations with other
Arctic countries while deepening China-Russia cooperation.  In fact, for
a long time, the Russian local level has always been wary of foreign
forces developing the Arctic region, worrying that the entry of foreign
companies will affect the dominance of domestic companies, damage the
ecological environment, and threaten regional security.  In view of
this, the deepening of Sino-Russian cooperation is inseparable from
China's gaining the trust of Russia at the local level and reaching a
consensus on interests. Therefore, it is necessary for China to
strengthen communication with Russia on the Arctic development policy at
the local level and to formulate an Arctic cooperation plan that is in
line with the long-term interests of both parties. At the same time,
China also needs to abide by international norms and protect the local
environment, which will be more beneficial for China to gain Russia's
trust in the Arctic. 

 

Yet China should ensure that its collaboration with Russia does not harm
its relationship with other Arctic states. In dealing with relations
with other Arctic countries, China should actively communicate and
exchange with other Arctic countries, earnestly respect the sovereignty,
sovereign rights and jurisdiction of Arctic countries, abide by the laws
and regulations of Arctic countries, and regularly conduct high-level
dialogue to improve political understanding and mutual trust. In
addition, as an observer state of the Arctic Council, China has the
right to reasonably express its views on Arctic governance, participate
in and assist the development of working group projects, and hold
expert-level seminars or gatherings on specific projects.11) 

 With the help of its status as an observer state of the Arctic Council,
China could actively promote the normalization work of the Arctic
Council and actively coordinate cooperation between Russia and other
Arctic countries in areas such as Arctic climate change, protection of
Indigenous culture, scientific research, and even economic development,
and promote the parties to temporarily shelve political disputes in
these areas, work and develop together.

**[[Spillover]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[to the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** might be expect, as a result of Western
wish to keep crippling Russia with more sanctions. (Buchanan, 2022) As
stressed in the recent sections of the secondary data analyzes chapters,
the **[[Arctic is a crucial part for Russia's
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the West tries to force Russia to
stop the war with Russia by putting huge sanctions on the state and
cripple its economy. **[[Western sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** put on
Russia is **[[much bigger]{.underline}]{.mark}** than the once that was
put during the Ukraine Crises in 2014. One of the scholars, E. Buchanan
(2022), in her article provides a list of events that is going on in the
Russian Arctic now, in light of a threat to be put under the Western
sanctions: "[Projects under threat include a 20% stake in Yamal LNG, a
10% stake in Arctic LNG-2, and a 10% stake in LNG transhipment hubs
along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). The 41 future of Ob LNG, also in the
Gydan Arctic peninsula, is uncertain as well. Shell has already
signalled plans to exit Russia's energy market, which will hit Moscow's
immediate plans for the Gydan Arctic peninsula ventures with Russia's
GazpromNeft. The UK's Beyond Petroleum (BP) has confirmed plans to exit
its 19.75% stake in Russia's oil major Rosneft. There will no doubt be
implications for Rosneft's famed Arctic Vostok Oil Project
precinct."]{.underline} (Buchanan, 2022) These given examples, by
Buchanan shows, that the **[[Russia-Ukraine spillover to the Arctic is
already being felt]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region. What is more,
the author continues to worry, that **[[isolating
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from Arctic debate and key forums such as
the Arctic Council will have]{.underline} **[[long-term
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to the author, if
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** won't be able to collaborate with the
Arctic and western states, it will **[[look for new
collaborations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. New potential players, could
[involve UEA, China and India]{.underline}. Author continues to stress,
that the possible increased involvement of the above mentioned states is
very real, since these three states demonstrated support for Russia
during the meeting at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), on
February 25, 2022. Where the states voted for denouncing Russia's
aggression towards Ukraine. (Council, 2022) While 11 of the UN Security
Council\'s 15 members voted in favor of the resolution to \"deplore\"
Russian aggression in Ukraine, China, India, and the United Arab
Emirates all voted no. These three **[[new Arctic
stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[sent a message to the rest of
the world about their objectives and beliefs.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
([Buchanan, 2022). Another possibly felt spillover in the Arctic is NATO
military exercise, on March 2022, Cold Response. The Cold Response,
which according to information provided in the official NATO website,
"(...) is a bi-annual drill, organised and hosted by the Norwegian Armed
Forces have, since 2006 (...)", in the Arctic region. (NATO, 2022) This
military excersise, provides NATO Allies and partners with an
irreplaceable opportunity to put their skills to the test against some
of the harshest weather conditions. As well as, forces NATO troops who
train there to learn the lessons of arctic warfare quickly. (NATO, 2022)
Even, if the military exercise was planned to take place way before the
Russia-Ukraine war, it is visible that this military exercise, is not
just for learning how to deal with a potential threat in a cold climate,
but to also show Russia, that they can hold on the attack against any
aggression, if needed. NATO organized Cold Response excersise on March,
2022, has raised concerns. In fact]{.underline},
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
**[[concerned]{.underline}]{.mark}** about NATO\'s increased military
activity **[[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Cold Response
exercise, took place in Norway, very close to the Russian border and
involved approximately 30, 000 soldiers from 27 countries. According to
Russia's Senior Arctic Official N. Kurchinov, this military exercise has
nothing to do with contributing to Arctic region's security. (Kadam,
2022) Kurchinov, later also addresses the matter of recent discussion
about **[[Sweden and Finland thinking of joining
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He stated to the news portal: "Certainly,
the expansion of NATO at the expense of traditionally non-bloc countries
will not contribute to security and mutual trust in the Arctic, which
Russia consistently advocates". (Kadam, 2022) [Russia is worried for a
valid reason. If Sweden and Finland join NATO, as both are seriously
considering doing, all Arctic states except Russia will be members of
the military alliance. NATO would then be able to conduct a strategic
re-evaluation of how the Arctic fits into the alliance, and the
decisions NATO makes would determine the future relationship. (YORK,
2022) Russia appears to be attempting to avoid any conflict escalation
in the Arctic region. Despite this, Russia\'s response to NATO exercises
with Finland and Sweden in early March was muted -- 42 it issued a
statement in protest and conducted its own military training exercises
on the same day. On the other hand, through the history of NATO and
Russia relationship, we can see that Russia has always protested when
NATO did military exercises close to its borders. Besides protesting
statements, Russia has never demonstrated any actions that could lead
into a possible conflict between Russia and NATO, in the Arctic. (YORK,
2022) Meanwhile NATO states, that]{.underline} **[[Russia's recent
attack is a threat to a global security and there is no surprise that
the Arctic states are feeling threatened and worried for their region
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Alliance members seems to be united
in seeking to counteract Russia\'s attempts to undermine international
security and stability, and is activily speaking about the readiness to
address chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, if
needed. (NATO, 2022) What is more, during 2022 Spring session of the
NATO Parliamentary Assembly meeting,Swedensand Finlands wish to join
NATO was acknowledged, by Njall Trausti Fridbertsson (Head of Iceland's
NATO delegation), "Finland and Sweden are important security providers
in Europe. When becoming members of NATO, they will further strengthen
the deterrence and defence of the Alliance. A question about the high
north. We are all aware that the high north is becoming increasingly
important in the strategic security and economic dimension. Therefore,
we must anticipate that Russia will respond to current events in various
ways, including the high north. With **[[Finland or Sweden
joining]{.underline}]{.mark}**, seven out of eight Arctic states will be
in \[the\] NATO Alliance, which I believe will **[[directly affect
Russia\'s calculus]{.underline}]{.mark}** and possible responses in the
region. While our common goal is stability, low tension and cooperation
in the high north, we **[[must consider the possibility of Russia
deciding to employ a more confrontational force posture in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**." (NATO, 2022) From this statement on
official NATO website, its is visible that the Alience is happy to gain
even more power in the Arctic, thus supresing Russia. Fridbertsson, in
his statement, tries to give a glimpse of hope that they are still
hoping, and there might still be hope for peaceful cooperation between
the NATO members and Russia, in a way also states that it is ready for
upcoming conflict. He seems, to be pretty certain, like a true realist
that its not gonna end well, and the cooperation won't likely to
continue

### AT No Arctic War - "Deterrence Checks"

#### Deterrence won't prevent conflict in the Arctic -- multipolarity and declining cooperation break the assumptions of classical deterrence theory

Nuclear Relations in the Arctic,"

[Arctic security can be characterised as a nexus between multipolar
nuclear conflict and climate change]{.underline}. Multipolarity is
defined as a global balance of power between multiple actors \[3\].
[[Climate Change]{.underline}]{.mark} is making seaways and resources
more accessible, which [[is leading to a thawing of territorial
conflicts which were formerly frozen]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4\].
[[China's increasing]{.mark} economic [interests]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the Arctic [mean[s it must be considered as a regional
actor]{.mark}]{.underline} despite its near-regional status \[5\].
[[Russia]{.underline} [has]{.underline}]{.mark} recently [[threatened to
use nuclear weapons]{.mark} against the United States]{.underline}
(U.S.) [due to]{.underline} its objections to Russia's invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}; [[this]{.underline} [sets a precedent for
heightened nuclear tension in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[which
is the most nuclearized area in the world]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
has seen a steady buildup of nuclear and conventional forces by regional
actors]{.underline} \[6\]. These factors have led to direct tensions
between three major nuclear actors (namely, NATO, China, and Russia) in
a region that is becoming increasingly competitive \[7\]. [These
[tensions cannot be adequately explained by existing deterrence
models]{.mark}, which rely on Cold War-era bipolar game
theory]{.underline} \[8\]. [Due to climate change, geopolitical tension,
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [nuclear relations in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[are unstable and present serious
security risks]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that cannot be contended with
through the use of classic deterrence theory]{.underline} \[9\]. The
Arctic region is 66.5° north of the equator and encompasses the United
States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and Iceland,
all of whom are members of the region's governing body, the Arctic
Council \[10\]. The region's international legal status currently lies
under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea, however, due
to climate change, polar ice is melting, making the region more
accessible by sea and opening up its vast oil and gas deposits for
extraction by regional actors \[11\]. [Sino-Russian
cooperation]{.underline} along sea routes [has given China significant
influence in the region,]{.underline} which it wants to develop into a
"Polar Silk Road" as outlined in its 2018 Arctic White Paper \[12\].
Chinese development interests do not align with Russia's geopolitical
goals in the Arctic, and China's ownership over Arctic infrastructure
represents an economic threat to Russian interests \[13\]. There is
growing competition between these regional actors which is exacerbated
by overlapping territorial boundary claims by Denmark, Canada, and
Russia. In addition, the Arctic Council has suspended cooperation due to
its chairmanship by Russia until the end of 2023 \[14\].
[Classic]{.underline} nuclear [deterrence]{.underline} is steeped in
Cold War bipolarity and [relies on two rational actors basing their
decisions on what they believe their opponents\' actions will be
\[]{.underline}15\]. Classic deterrence is expressed through the Chicken
Game \[16\]. As seen in the figure below, a player's options are to
defect and pursue a foreign policy objective or to cooperate and
maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for an actor is to
defect against a cooperating partner; however, this runs the risk of
![](media/image1.png){width="3.1964490376202974in"
height="2.2685192475940505in"}both players defecting, leading to nuclear
annihilation \[18\]. [This [classic]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} [game [does not contend with the
possibility of conflict between **multiple nuclear
actors**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which is a key feature of Arctic
security]{.underline}]{.mark} \[19\]. Though a three-player chicken game
has been applied to theoretical problems, such as two out of three
players needing to complete a task that all would rather not complete,
this model has yet to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\]. China,
NATO, the U.S., and Russia's [nuclear doctrines are informed by
deterrence theory, which is problematic due to the theory's assumption
of a bipolar world order]{.underline} \[21\]. [[Nuclear multipolarity in
the Arctic is unstable because it no longer falls within the traditional
game theory matrix]{.mark},]{.underline} [and there is an increased risk
of nuclear action due to a larger number of nuclear actors and
significant regional tension]{.underline} \[22\]. [[Preemptive nuclear
strikes are more prevalent in multipolar nuclear politics]{.mark} due to
a greater perception of threat from other actors \[]{.underline}23\].
Though China promotes itself as a No First Use (NFU) state, meaning that
it will not strike unless struck upon in a nuclear capacity, Russia has
threatened to strike first, and America's position on NFU is vague
\[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent organisation in the Arctic region,
only Sweden is not yet a full NATO member and Finland has just recently
gained NATO membership \[25\]. [In multipolar deterrence, regional
conflicts are more likely to escalate into total nuclear
warfare,]{.underline} and de-escalation relies on political bargaining
as opposed to rationality modelling. Thus, it is unclear how political
bargaining will take place in an increasingly polarised Arctic \[26\].
Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty \[27\]. This breakdown in communication between Arctic
actors due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's recent threat
to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. indicates [that future regional
disputes over Arctic resources, navigation, and territory may give rise
to nuclear crises]{.underline} \[28\]. Climate change in the Arctic has
rendered the region more accessible to its actors; this has inflamed
tensions between the NATO bloc and Russia over territorial disputes and
Russia's war in Ukraine and between China and Russia due to diverging
economic development goals \[29\]. As temperatures warm, [[the region
may become a nuclear flashpoint that cannot be analysed using classic
deterrent models]{.underline}]{.mark} \[30\].

### AT Arctic War Won't Escalate

#### Arctic war escalates -- intense resource competition and hybrid warfare strategies

**Wallin 25,** Matthew Wallin, Public diplomacy, military history,
national security policy, nuclear security, U.S.-Russia relations,
asymmetric operations**,** 5-12-2025, \"Is the Arctic Destined to be the
Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear War?,\" American Security Project,
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war///gpaul\]

Amidst these tensions, **[[melting]{.underline}]{.mark}** polar
**[[ice]{.underline}]{.mark}** is **[[opening]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Arctic sea lanes to increased shipping traffic,
**[[resource]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and military posturing. NATO's
newest members, Finland and Sweden, are Arctic nations.
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** currently
**[[dominates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Arctic region, holding 53% of
its total coastline, operating the world's biggest icebreaker fleet, and
has been upgrading its Arctic military
bases. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
**[[also]{.underline}]{.mark}** increasingly playing a role, conducting
joint Arctic military exercises with Russia and employing an icebreaker
fleet of its own, despite its complete lack of territory in the Arctic
Circle.

But is the Arctic destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war? Let's look at the possibilities.

[Despite being so cold, the Arctic is no stranger to military conflict,
holding major strategic value and serving as a passageway to both the
Atlantic and Pacific. During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic
extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war supplies to the
Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany invaded Norway,
and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War of 1940. As the
Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a major theater for submarine
activity.]{.underline}

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland "one way or
the other" highlights the growing importance of the Arctic to the
security interests of the United States. Greenland's geographic
location, combined with the U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space Base in
the high north, provides key "missile warning, missile defense, and
space surveillance" capabilities. The shortest flight paths for nuclear
missiles between the U.S. and Russia exist over the Arctic Ocean, and
the loss of this base on account of a diplomatic blunder could open a
key blind spot in America's strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss
of this base to a Russian attack aimed at disabling American missile
detection infrastructure is unlikely due to the danger of immediate
retaliation and escalation.

Currently, the **[[most likely path]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a
potential nuclear exchange in the Arctic would be
**[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[conventional or "gray zone"
Russian attack on a NATO member]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Border
skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace incursions, reckless military
intercepts, and support to separatist groups intentionally sit in the
"gray zone" between peace and outright war, but could **[[ultimately
lead to open conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** that escalates to nuclear
war. Conceivably, a gray zone or overt attack on other Greelandic
infrastructure, or an information operations campaign aimed at dividing
the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not outside of the realm of
possibility.

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland---which
shares a 1,343 km border with Russia---there is increased opportunity
that a NATO Arctic state could be attacked. Highlighting this risk,
American forces in Alaska recently staged a drill in which hundreds of
troops were flown to Finland to defend against a mock Russian invasion.
Yet rather than an overt invasion of a NATO member, **[[Russia
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** far more **[[likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**
test the waters by **[[conducting]{.underline}]{.mark}** provocative and
**[[destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** small-scale gray zone
**[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The disastrous results of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about
its ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear
armed country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct attack
unlikely. [It is not entirely clear where the red line on gray zone
activities would be for Finland or what would trigger an Article 5
collective defense declaration short of a direct attack across the
border.]{.underline}

[Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter
a Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing doubt about his willingness to defend a
NATO member that comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe
about America's commitment]{.underline}. As a result, France and the UK
are considering expanding their arsenals, signifying an increased
reliance on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for the defense
of Arctic NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it wants to
decommission its current warheads as it brings replacements online,
potentially doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is simultaneously
upgrading an airbase closer to the German border to be able to host
nuclear weapons. The UK, which has been historically dependent on the
U.S. for its nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning that dependence,
and may seek other options to assure an effective and reliable
deterrent. This could foretell a new nuclear arms race.

The **[[upcoming]{.underline}]{.mark}** February 2026 **[[expiration of
New START]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the last remaining strategic nuclear
arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, portends a **[[period
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration that could echo the nuclear
arms buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has been operating in the
Arctic, has been **[[engaging in]{.underline}]{.mark}** its own rapid
nuclear **[[buildup]{.underline}]{.mark}** in an effort to potentially
exceed 1,000 warheads by 2035. China has consistently
**[[rejected]{.underline}]{.mark}** efforts to join a multilateral
nuclear arms **[[reduction treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the U.S.
and Russia, citing its comparatively much smaller nuclear arsenal.

**[[Navigation issues]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic could also
**[[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark}** military escalations reaching the
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}** level. The Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS), which includes satellite constellations like
the American GPS system or Russian GLONASS, sees **[[decreased
reliability]{.underline}]{.mark}** and accuracy in the Arctic. The
reasons for this are abundant, like the orbital inclination of the
satellites themselves and ionospheric interference. With increased
incidents of Russian GNSS jamming in Europe, it's conceivable that
**[[Russia may employ]{.underline}]{.mark}** similar
**[[tactics]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic, including
**[[spoofing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for the purpose of
**[[disruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** or causing navigational errors to
trigger an **[[exploitable international
incident]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Military or civilian
**[[vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}** straying into Russian territory could
be **[[captured]{.underline}]{.mark}**, their cargoes
[[seized]{.underline}]{.mark}, or crews [[held
hostage]{.underline}]{.mark} for the purpose of conducting hostage
diplomacy. Resolving such a confrontation military could [[quickly
spiral out of control]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Rising Temperatures Increase the Likelihood of Nuclear War,\" Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/nuclear-defense-climate-change//gpaul\]

In the Arctic, global warming is producing a wholly different sort of
peril: **[[geopolitical competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** and conflict
made possible **[[by the melting of the polar ice
cap]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Before long, the Arctic ice cap is expected
to disappear in summertime and to shrink noticeably in the winter,
making the **[[region more attractive for resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to the US Geological
Survey, an estimated **[[30 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
world's remaining **[[undiscovered]{.underline}]{.mark}** natural
**[[gas]{.underline}]{.mark}** is above the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** Circle; vast reserves of **[[iron ore,
uranium, and rare earth minerals are also thought to be buried
there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These resources, along with the appeal of
faster commercial shipping routes linking Europe and Asia, have induced
all the major powers, including China, to establish or expand operations
in the region. **[Russia has rehabilitated numerous Arctic bases
abandoned after the Cold War and built others; the United States has
done likewise, modernizing its radar installation at Thule in Greenland,
reoccupying an airfield at Keflavík in Iceland, and establishing bases
in northern Norway.]{.underline}**

Increased **[economic and military competition in the Arctic has
significant nuclear implications, as numerous weapons are deployed there
and geography lends it a key role in many nuclear
scenarios]{.underline}**. Most of Russia's missile-carrying submarines
are based near Murmansk, on the Barents Sea (an offshoot of the Arctic
Ocean), and many of its nuclear-armed bombers are also at bases in the
region to take advantage of the short polar route to North America. As a
counterweight, the Pentagon has deployed additional subs and
antisubmarine aircraft near the Barents Sea and interceptor aircraft in
Alaska, followed by further measures by Moscow. "I do not want to stoke
any fears here," Russian President Vladimir Putin declared in June 2017,
"but experts are aware that US nuclear submarines remain on duty in
northern Norway.... We must protect \[Russia's\] shore accordingly."

On the other side of the equation, an **[intensifying [arms race]{.mark}
will [block progress]{.mark} against climate change by [siphoning
resources]{.mark} needed for a global energy transition and by
[poison]{.mark}ing the [relations]{.mark} among the great powers,
[impeding]{.mark} joint [efforts]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [slow the
warming]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

With the signing of the Paris Agreement, it appeared that the [great
**[powers]{.mark}** might [unite]{.mark} in a global effort to slash
greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to **[avoid
catastrophe]{.mark}**, [but]{.mark} those [hopes]{.mark} have since
**[receded]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the time, Obama emphasized that
limiting global warming would require nations to work together in an
environment of trust and peaceful cooperation. Instead of leading the
global transition to a postcarbon energy system, however, the **[[major
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** are spending massively to
**[[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** capabilities and engaging in
**[[conflict-provoking behaviors.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Since fiscal year 2016, the annual **[[budget of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the US **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense has
**[[risen]{.underline}]{.mark}** from \$580 billion to \$738 billion in
fiscal year 2020. **[When the budget increases for each fiscal year
since 2016 are combined, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will have
[spent]{.mark} an additional \$380 billion on military programs by the
end of this fiscal year---more than [enough to jump-start]{.mark} the
[transition to a carbon-​free economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If the
Pentagon budget rises as planned to \$747 billion in fiscal year 2024, a
total of \$989 billion in additional spending will have been devoted to
military operations and procurement over this period,
**[[leaving]{.underline}]{.mark}** precious **[[little
money]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a Green New Deal or any other scheme
**[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** systemic
**[[decarbonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Meanwhile, policy-makers in Washington, Beijing, and Moscow increasingly
regard one another as implacable and dangerous adversaries. "As
**[[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** seek to
**[[expand]{.underline}]{.mark}** their global
**[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**," then--Director of National
Intelligence Dan Coats informed Congress in a January 2019 report, "they
are **[[eroding]{.underline}]{.mark}** once well-established
**[[security norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** and increasing the **[[risk
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** regional
**[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Chinese and Russian officials
have been making similar statements about the United States.
**[[Secondary powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** like India, Pakistan, and
Turkey are also assuming increasingly militaristic postures,
facilitating the potential spread of nuclear weapons and
**[[exacerbating]{.underline}]{.mark}** regional
**[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this environment, it is almost
impossible to imagine future climate negotiations at which the great
powers agree on concrete measures for a rapid transition to a clean
energy economy.

In a world constantly poised for nuclear war while facing widespread
state decay from climate disruption, these **[[twin
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** would intermingle and **[[intensify each
other]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Climate-​related **[[resource
stresses]{.underline}]{.mark}** and disputes would
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** the level of global discord and the
**[[risk of]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear
**[[escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the nuclear arms race would
poison relations between states and **[[make]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
global energy **[[transition impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

But such an outcome is not inevitable. Mass movements have emerged to
close coal plants, halt fracking, block the construction of fossil fuel
infrastructure, and divest from fossil fuel companies. Swedish climate
activist Greta Thunberg, with her School Strike 4 Climate campaign, has
inspired millions of young people around the world to engage in climate
activism. On the nuclear side, groups like Global Zero and Back From the
Brink are campaigning for a global no-first-use policy by the
nuclear-armed states; in Congress, progressive Democrats fought to deny
funds for the procurement of new missiles that would have violated the
terms of the INF Treaty.

What is essential and still largely missing is a recognition that
climate and peace activism must be linked if the twin perils of global
warming and nuclear war are to be overcome. People must understand that
it will be very difficult to slow global warming unless the nuclear arms
race is also slowed---and, likewise, that the **[[risk
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}** will
**[[grow]{.underline}]{.mark}** as long as nuclear-armed states are
**[[threatened by climate disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only by
**[[uniting]{.underline}]{.mark}** our
**[[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward climate and nuclear sanity in
a joint campaign for human **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}** will it
be **[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}** to triumph over these destructive
forces. 

#### Arctic war causes extinction

**Crisinger 19** \[David, 11/19/2020, executive director of the public
policy writing workshop at the University of Chicago,
<https://thewarhorse.org/author/davidchrisinger/,> AR\]

[One of the greatest risks, according to Niklas Granholm,
is]{.underline} that the Arctic region will undergo a "Balkanization"
like what occurred in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Granholm is the deputy director of studies at the Swedish Defence
Research Agency, and he points to the Faroe Islands calling for
self-rule from Denmark, Scotland clamoring for independence from the
United Kingdom after Brexit, and the resurgence of troubles in Northern
Ireland as indicators that more fragmentation [and [political division
in the Arctic could lead]{.mark} to less cooperation or even
[hostility]{.mark}. Paired with the great-power [competition among the
United States, Russia, and China]{.mark}, any Balkanization of the
region would, in Granholm's words, be a "double whammy" and [could make
the Arctic much more combustible]{.mark}. "Whatever happens in the
Arctic won't stay there," he said. "[It will
escalate]{.mark}."]{.underline} Is this the beginning of a new Cold War?
The new Norwegian radar system undermines Russia's ability to launch a
retaliatory nuclear strike from its submarine fleet in the Arctic, New
York Times reported, and that bothers Russia, according to Lt. Col.
Tormod Heier, a faculty adviser at the Norwegian Defense University
College. Because it upsets the strategic nuclear balance between the
United States and Russia, the new radar system establishes a blow to
Russia's last indisputable claim to great-power status. "There is a new
Cold War," Heier told the Times, adding that [[the risk of nuclear war
was much higher now]{.mark} than in the old Cold War "because Russia is
so much weaker, and because of that much more dangerous and
unpredictable."]{.underline} In recognition of the threats posed by a
new Cold War[, the Pentagon released an updated National Defense
Strategy in January 2018. While the document makes no specific mention
of the Arctic, it recognizes the threats posed by great-power
competition (especially as it relates to America's eroding competitive
edge) and clarifies that potential [conflict with Russia and
China]{.mark} had supplanted [terrorism as the biggest threat to
American national security]{.mark}.]{.underline} To achieve this end
state, the United States must confront three risks that, if they
materialized, would stand in the way. First, bad actors could use the
Arctic as a staging ground for an attack on the U.S. homeland. Second,
[states like [Russia and China could challenge the rules-based
international order in the Arctic in ways that could lead to
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Third, but not least, tensions,
competition, and conflict in other parts of the world could spill over
into the Arctic. Three months later, the U.S. Coast Guard released its
own strategy for the Arctic, which called for funding to upgrade ships,
aircraft, and unmanned systems operating in the region. Admiral Karl
Schultz, the Coast Guard's commandant, told the Washington Post that the
goal should be to return the Arctic to a "peaceful place where we work
to cross international lines here with partner nations that share
interests in a transparent fashion." Projecting sovereignty, he
continued, will help expedite that return. But all these plans have
failed to persuade decision makers to establish new organizational
structures designed to address changes in the Arctic wrought by climate
change and the rush to exploit the region's natural resources. The plans
do not include any substantive plans to guide the construction of
infrastructure needed in the region, nor do they detail how resources
will need to be reallocated to mitigate risks and help the United States
reach its desired end state. They provide a vision for the future, but
they do not provide a road map on how to get there. [Russia won't back
down]{.underline} In late August 2019, a Russian submarine emerged from
the icy waters near the North Pole and fired a Sineva-type
intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear
warhead. That same day, another Russian submarine in the Arctic Circle
launched a Bulava-type intercontinental ballistic missile from beneath
the surface of the Barents Sea. One missile hit a remote corner of
Russia's Pacific coast, and the other landed on the Kanin Peninsula.
Twelve years after Russia planted its flag on the seabed below the North
Pole, this demonstration of its military capabilities in the Arctic can
be seen as its latest attempt to assert its sovereignty in the region[.
Against a broader backdrop of distrust and diminished communication
across the U.S.-Russia divide, there exists a risk that relatively minor
[miscalculations or misinterpretations could escalate into broader
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Arctic relations are fracturing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Northern
military activity is at its highest level since the end of the Cold War.
[The idea of the Arctic as a 'zone of peace]{.underline}'\[1\] [has been
replaced with a narrative about the top of the world as an emerging
arena for great power rivalry]{.underline}. In 2020 alone, the U.S.
Sixth Fleet recently conducted three maritime security operations in the
Barents Sea, just off the Arctic coast of Norway and Russia. This
followed warnings by then U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Kenneth J.
Braithwaite of increasing hostility in the Arctic, noting, 'The Chinese
and the Russians are everywhere, especially the Chinese.' This explicit
name-calling in Arctic politics was a shift from previous U.S.
administrations' more sober approaches to circumpolar geopolitics, where
resource development, mitigating climate change, and ensuring harmonious
regional relations were pronounced priorities. The recently inaugurated
Biden Administration will have to grapple with what to do with, and in,
the Arctic. A reversal, however, to the old days of the 2010s, is not
possible. In fact, the deterioration in the Arctic is not so much a
response to events in the Arctic, as a consequence of the challenges and
trends emerging in global politics over the last decade. If President
Biden wants the United States to lead again, the Arctic will need to be
on his radar. As noted by Francis Fukuyama, 'Major crises have major
consequences, usually unforeseen'. The COVID-19 pandemic might have been
unanticipated, yet its impact on an ever-eroding international order is
already tangible. Multilateralism -- the rule-based collaboration
between states -- is not dissolving because of a small contagious agent.
Instead, the pandemic might only be promoting an already on-going
development. What [we have seen]{.underline} over the past years has not
only been [an accelerated transformation of our]{.underline} well-known
[liberal international order]{.underline} of rules, norms and
institutions, dominated by a single hegemonic superpower. Perhaps we
have witnessed the first manifestations of its dissolution. This ongoing
transformation is best understood when studying international politics
concerned with specific geographical domains or issue areas. Such
[[regional examples provide an answer on what comes next for the liberal
international order]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Nowhere is this more
apparent than the Arctic]{.mark} region in the 21st
century]{.underline}. Despite hopes that the Arctic remain isolated from
troubles elsewhere, the Arctic cannot indefinitely remain a separate
region independent of what happens in other parts of the world, often
involving the same (Arctic) actors. Nevertheless, there is room for
diplomatic action and handywork, trying to keep the illusion of a
special Arctic spirit alive. This is where the U.S. under President
Biden must step up and alter the course set out by the previous
administration. Over the past fifteen years, [the circumpolar North has
become]{.underline} a global hotspot -- unfortunately quite literally,
but also as [an emerging arena to take the temperature on international
politics and relations between great powers.]{.underline} Today, [the
region is one of the spots on the planet most affected by climate
change, as sea ice]{.underline} and the Greenlandic ice sheet [continue
to melt at an ever-increasing pace]{.underline}. Eventually, rising sea
levels and coastal flooding are set to have negative cross-border
effects, causing more extreme weather events globally, from devastating
storms to extreme droughts. Yet, this is only one side of the Arctic's
story. The region is also home to some of world's largest fish stocks,
undiscovered oil and gas resources as well as an abundance of rare
minerals found only in a few places around the world. In addition, the
increasingly ice-free waters can serve as a maritime transportation
shortcut from Europe to Asia (or reverse) via the top of the world. And
even though the Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of
the globe, it is still one of the coldest spots on Earth. This provides
the Arctic with a climatological competitive advantage, currently to be
discovered by the world's leading tech firms to appease the world's
hunger for digital infrastructure. The colder it is, the less energy is
needed to cool down data centers, while the remaining energy demand can
be met using renewable energy sources (for example, hydro power or wind
farms). Thus, only [few places have been the source of as much
speculation, hype, and sweeping statements as the Arctic region at the
start of the 21st century.]{.underline} Yet already [during the Cold
War, the Arctic held a prominent place in the political and military
standoffs between the two superpowers.]{.underline} This was important
not because of interactions in the Arctic itself (though the
cat-and-mouse games of submarines took place there), but because of its
wider strategic role in the systemic competition between the U.S. and
the USSR. With the end of the Cold War, the Arctic was transformed from
a region of geo-strategic rivalry to one where a (now diminished)
Russian state would cooperate in various novel collaborative
arrangements with its former Western adversaries. Several regional
organizations (the Arctic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and
the Northern Forum) emerged in the 1990s to tackle issues such as
environmental degradation, regional and local development, and cultural
and economic cross-border cooperation. But whereas interaction increased
during this period among Arctic states and also included Arctic
Indigenous peoples (as they gained more political visibility and an
official voice), geopolitically the region seemed to disappear from the
radar of global power politics. [Since the mid-2000s the Arctic's
strategic importance has reappeared]{.underline}. Echoing the dynamics
of the Cold War, this began to happen primarily because Russia, under
President Vladimir Putin, started to re-build its military (and nuclear)
prowess in order to re-assert its position at the head table of world
politics. And given the country's geography and recent history, its
obvious focus would be its Arctic lands and seas. In this terrain Russia
could pursue, unobstructed, its policy of rebuilding its forces as well
as expanding its defense and deterrence capabilities. This has not come
primarily because of changing political circumstances in the Arctic, but
because Russia maintains a naturally (that is, geographically) dominant
position in the North. The state's historically strong naval presence
--- the Northern Fleet, on the Kola Peninsula where its strategic
submarines are based --- is essential to the county's status as a major
nuclear power on the world stage. Since its (re)emergence in world
politics around 2006--7, [[the Arctic]{.mark} region [has]{.mark} often
[been portrayed as the next arena]{.mark}]{.underline} for geopolitical
conflict --- the place [[where Russia, the U.S., and]{.mark} eventually
[China]{.mark} [are bound to clash]{.mark}]{.underline}. As prominently
stated in 2008, '[global warming has given birth to a new scramble for
territory and resources among the five Arctic powers]{.underline}.'
[Into this]{.underline} evolutionary geo-economic and geo-strategic mix,
[China has surfaced as a new Arctic actor]{.underline} in recent years.
Indeed, China has proclaimed itself as a 'near-Arctic state'. [[With
Beijing's]{.mark} continuous [efforts to assert influence]{.mark}
through its global network of dominance, [the Arctic has emerged as the
latest arena]{.mark} where China's presence and interaction are
components [of its expanding power]{.mark} in both soft and hard
terms]{.underline}, be it China's interests in scientific research or
investments in Russia's fossil fuel and mineral extraction industries
across Arctic countries. China protects its range of interests --- from
businesses to opinions on developments related to the Law of the Sea ---
as part of this expansion of its political might in the region and
worldwide. Yet, the last decade has also shown that the idea of
'resource wars' in the North are unlikely to emerge. Oil and gas,
minerals, or fish stocks are predominantly located in the maritime zones
or territories of the Arctic states. Arctic states --- including the
U.S. and Russia --- desire stable operating environments for extracting
costly resources far away from their prospective markets. Countries in
the circumpolar region have recognized the value of creating a political
environment favorable to investments and economic development. In
response to the outcry and concerns about the 'lack of governance' in
the Arctic spurred by the growing international awareness of the region,
top-level political representatives of the five Arctic coastal states
--- Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the U.S. ---
met in Ilulissat, Greenland in 2008, where they publicly declared the
Arctic to be a 'region of cooperation.' They also affirmed their
intention to work within established international arrangements and
agreements, especially the Law of the Sea. The Arctic states, which also
include Finland, Iceland, and Sweden, have repeated this mantra of
cooperation, articulating the same sentiment in relatively streamlined
Arctic policy and strategy documents. This sentiment has not changed
even with the deterioration in relations between Russia and its Arctic
neighbors since 2014 as a result of Russian actions in Ukraine and
Crimea. Indeed, the foreign ministries of all Arctic Council members
(including Russia) keep pro-actively emphasizing the 'peaceful' and
'cooperative' nature of regional politics. Moreover, some argued that
low-level forms of regional interaction help relax tensions in the
North. To illustrate, the Arctic Council emerged in the wake of the Cold
War's close as the primary forum for regional affairs in the Arctic.
Founded in 1996, the Council serves as a platform from which its
member-states can portray themselves as working harmoniously towards
common goals. Adding to its legitimacy, an increasing number of actors
have, since the late 1990s, applied and gained observer status on the
Council --- initially Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain,
and the United Kingdom, and more recently China, Italy, India, Japan,
Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and (unsuccessfully) the European
Union. Pessimists were proven wrong, and instead of Arctic anarchy, the
Arctic countries 'engaged in various impressive feats of cooperation'
(same journal, same author, different year -- 2013). Moreover, the
Arctic was used as working case of 'complex interdependence' able to
preserve existing regional cooperation, even in case of international
crises, as for instance Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. As such,
the Arctic has become an exceptional space of regional governance,
co-operation and peaceful co-existence -- a political vision detached
from global developments. However, when launching #NATO2030, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg argued for a more global approach of
the alliance, inter alia due to China's increasing Arctic interests.
This followed a speech given in 2019 by then U.S. Secretary of State,
Mike Pompeo, that represented a clear break with notions of the Arctic
as a 'zone of peace', as he lambasted both Russian and Chinese actions
in the Arctic. What the speech essentially did, was to shatter the
self-imposed separation between great power politics and regional
relations that the Arctic states had, up until that point, made use of
to promote constructive regional relations. The main rationale for this
is the changing role of the Arctic in an international system in a state
of flux. Ever since 1945, the United States have upheld an international
liberal order the American way -- a set of alliances, institutions, and
rules the United States led to create after World War II. An
international order organized around free trade and U.S. military
presence in Europe and Asia that ensured to protect American interests.
An international order that made Europe find its inner peace and
eventually assert its full dominance after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union. And yet, the end of history brought considerable changes to the
international liberal order, transforming both its underlying power
configuration, its principles, norms and rules, its patterns of
cooperation and conflict, as well as its legitimacy and effectiveness.
The dispersion of power in the international system created a more
'multifaceted order based on complex and polycentric governance
arrangements among a wider community of national governments,
international organizations and non-state actors.' The world has
changed, and so did the U.S., be it because of 9/11, the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, a global financial crisis, the deterioration of
East--West relations or the rise of China. In came a President that
announced America's Pacific century and simultaneously emphasized the
necessity of other nations to share more of the international burden. In
came another President who argued for America to be first, dismantling
(or at least questioning) the multilateral order and stability the U.S.
built for decades. This fueled the fear that the consensus of
cooperation and the compliance with international obligations is
slightly eroding with short-term national interests dominating long-term
international considerations. [Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S.
has been integral to the development of the 'peaceful' order in the
Arctic specifically]{.underline}. Recognizing shared interests with
other Arctic states, emphasizing the need for cooperation also with
actors that one disagrees with, and initiating new regional projects
(symbolic and real) support this development. [Now]{.underline},
however, [the immediate concern is the growing hostility
between]{.underline} what some refer to as the 'two poles' --- [the U.S.
and]{.underline} (its perceived challenger) [China]{.underline}. The
Trump Administration did not question Arctic cooperation or its
multilateral modus operandi but made use of the Arctic as yet another
arena to challenge in particular China, but also Russia. Great power
rivalry returned to the Arctic. So far, however, China's increasing
global engagement and influence has in fact been rather subdued in the
North. Beijing, for all its rhetoric about its ambitions for a 'Polar
Silk Route' has used all the correct Arctic buzzwords in tune with the
preferences of the Arctic states. Yet, [[there are fears that this may
just be]{.underline}]{.mark} a mollifying tactic: merely [[the beginning
of a]{.mark} pushier Chinese presence where geo-economic
actions]{.underline} --- financial investments motivated by geopolitical
goals --- [are part of a larger political **[strategy aimed at
challenging the hegemony of the 'West']{.mark}** as well as the balance
of power in the North]{.underline}. The Arctic speech by Secretary of
State Pompeo in 2019 fed directly into this narrative. However, the U.S.
has a considerable security presence in the Arctic that ranges from
military bases in Keflavik (Iceland) and Thule (Greenland) to troops in
Canada and (rotating) troops in Norway, as well as its own Alaskan
Arctic component. Five out of eight Arctic states are also NATO-members.
It is unlikely that Chinese actions in the region can challenge this
presence. Moreover, its regional engagement assumes predominantly
soft-power characteristics. Shifting power balances and greater regional
interest from Beijing are not destined to lead to tension and conflict;
on the contrary, these trends might spur efforts to find ways of
including China in regional forums, alleviating the (geo-economic)
concerns of Arctic states. In other words, 'how' to balance these
concerns will be at the core of Arctic geopolitical concerns in years to
come. [The other great-power actor with global aspirations]{.underline}
(which, in contrast to China, is actually in the Arctic region) [is
Russia]{.underline}, operating in tandem with its desire to project
influence. As by far the largest Arctic country with the most ambition
in terms of military investments and activity, Russia sets the
parameters for much of the Arctic security trajectory. This is not
likely to change, although exactly how the future Arctic security
environment will look depends on the 'West's' response to Russian
actions taking place predominantly in other regions around the world.
However, Russian military engagement in the Arctic does not have a
uniform regional effect. This is where the sub-regional Arctic relations
come into play, and geographic proximity should not be underestimated.
After all, neighboring regions, like those of Norway and Russia, are
forced to interact regardless of the positive or negative character of
their relations. The U.S. Sixth Fleet had reasons for sailing in the
Barents Sea just off the coast of NATO ally Norway: this is the part of
the Arctic region that is experiencing the most military activity and
might pose the highest security risk for the U.S. and its allies.
Finally, [[there is the fear]{.underline}]{.mark} (by the 'West') [[of a
Chinese-Russian alliance]{.mark} growing beyond the current economic
joint ventures that the two countries' state-owned companies have
embarked o]{.underline}n. Although there are signs that this alliance
might be a difficult thing to achieve in reality, [it can still pose
problems for the other Arctic states if sanctions and rivalry continue
to push Russia into Chinese arms]{.underline}. The U.S., both under
Democratic and Republican presidents, always had a troubled relationship
with the normative-institutional framework, with its leaders
interpreting the U.S.' role of guarantor of the liberal international
order as encompassing a right to derogate from liberal rules and
practices whenever it was required by the national interest. The
difference today is that the proposition that the liberal order may no
longer be an emanation of U.S. power, but in fact a constraint on it,
has regained considerable legitimacy under the Trump Administration (and
potentially even before). But this panicked narrative misses a deeper
reality: [[although the United States' position]{.mark} in the global
system [is changing, the liberal international order is]{.mark} alive
and [still functioning]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, Russia (and President
Putin) might consider the liberal order to be 'obsolete'. Yes, China and
other emerging powers wish to gain more authority and leadership within
the international order and international organizations, but they do not
necessarily (and automatically) contest the basic rules and principles
of the liberal international order. Similarly, 'the very fact that more
states use multilateral fora, whether regional or global, to push
national or regional interests is not per se indicative of a corrosion
of multilateralism or economic liberalism.' Although distinct regional
international organization clusters exist, the boundaries between these
clusters are becoming less sharp as states are increasingly working
through other international organizations with states outside their own
clusters. [What does that mean for the Arctic's international order and
the U.S.' role? The Arctic has risen on the strategic agenda, simply
because the U.S. and Russia are already in the region, and China is
increasingly demonstrating its]{.underline} (strategic) [northern
interests.]{.underline} [If global relations continue to deteriorate
among these actors]{.underline} (i.e., increasingly bellicose
statements, military posturing and exercises, sanctions regimes)
[greater tensions in the Arctic may well result]{.underline}. Crucially,
[[what happens in the Arctic does not remain solely in the
Arctic]{.mark}, be it related to the environment or
politics.]{.underline} Conversely, events and processes elsewhere in
turn impact the Arctic in terms of global warming, security, and desires
to exploit economic opportunities. In other words, **[[the Arctic has
become the ultimate gauge of changes in the international order more
generally]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Biden Administration needs to take
this interdependence into account across a range of pressing issues in
the Arctic, ranging from grappling with climate deterioration to the
increase in military exercises and posturing.

**The [collapse]{.underline} of liberal institutions generates a
[self-reinforcing cycle]{.underline} that erodes [every
constraint]{.underline} on conflict. That ensures [nuclear
annihilation]{.underline}.**

Under this scenario, **[[disorder]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}**
[[emerges fuelled by]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[collapse]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[cooperative
mechanisms]{.underline}**]{.mark} [within nations and at the
international level]{.underline}. [Challenges]{.underline} fester and
**[accelerate]{.underline}**, [and opportunities remain]{.underline}
**[unaddressed]{.underline}** [as the international system [no
longer]{.mark} provides a]{.underline} **[[buffer]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or response **[to [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Many nations resort to
protecting their own interests and impose restrictions on others.

[Geopolitical [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} simmer or
**[[escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [marked by]{.underline} continuing
or expanded [conflicts in]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[Mid]{.underline}**dle **[East]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} **[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea ([and potentially]{.underline}
**[elsewhere]{.underline}**). US-China trade wars feed trade
isolationism, [add to]{.underline} global **[[supply chain
woes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and weaken]{.underline} economic [growth
prospects]{.underline}. **[[Inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}** [continues
to widen]{.underline} within many countries; in developing economies,
the standard of living does not significantly increase compared to that
of industrialized economies. **[[Labour

**[debt]{.underline}**]{.mark} [continues to [soar]{.mark}]{.underline}

national **[grievances]{.underline}** [means countries disregard
international institutions and rules, which [leads
to]{.mark}]{.underline} defaulting on debt repayments and to
[international [rules being ignored]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This [confluence of destabilizing factors drives the scenario
of]{.underline} **[global disorder]{.underline}**. The basic "disorder"
scenario is divided into two pathways: 4a, hot wars; and 4b, a
multipolar cold war.

Key Assumptions under Scenario 4

- Geopolitical instability: Current [conflicts and regional hot
  wars]{.underline} fester or **[spread]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
  **[multiply]{.underline}**.

- Economic decline:

<!-- -->

- The global economy continues to stagnate under debt burden and
  protectionism, and trade wars expand.

- Socio-economic conditions decline in terms of labour market
  conditions, with rising inequality.

<!-- -->

- Technology disruption: This [creates]{.underline} **[social
  tensions]{.underline}** [within countries and divides countries into
  haves and have-nots]{.underline}. [A]{.underline}
  **[[tech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}**
  [[ensues]{.mark} between]{.underline} the [major
  economies]{.underline}.

Pathway 4a: Hot Wars --- Proliferation and Escalation

[Geopolitical tensions in]{.underline}
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**/Russia,
**[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the]{.underline}
**[[Mid]{.underline}]{.mark}**dle **[[East]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[the]{.underline} **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea,
[[and]{.mark} potentially [elsewhere]{.mark} spread in tandem and
[intensify]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Emboldened by]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[West's increased
[isolationism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and divisions in Europe,
[**[Russia]{.underline}** [sets]{.underline}]{.mark} [its sights
[on]{.mark} consolidating its]{.underline} already [occupied territories
in]{.underline} [**[Moldova]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Georgia]{.underline}**]{.mark}. US isolationism
[undermines]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**, [and populist
nationalists in]{.underline} **[France]{.underline}**,
**[Hungary]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Italy]{.underline}** [all
impede a]{.underline} **[unified]{.underline}** NATO
[response]{.underline} to Russia's advances. Without adequate supply of
weapons to Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin advances to take
over Ukraine and moves to occupy Moldova and Georgia.

Meanwhile, **[[Israel's war]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Gaza and continued
assassinations and bombings in Iran and Lebanon [elicit a response from
the]{.underline} **[[Axis of Resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Militants in]{.underline} **[Yemen]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[Syria]{.underline}**,
**[Lebanon]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Iraq]{.underline}** [join
forces to [respond]{.mark}]{.underline} to Israel [with a]{.underline}
**[consolidated]{.underline}** conventional [war]{.underline}. The
United States responds by supporting Israel and fighting with it in the
Middle East.

In the South China Sea, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** [continues its
intimidation of shipping lanes to [assert]{.mark}]{.underline} its
**[maritime [dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the strategic
waterway]{.underline}. [With]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}** Congress
**[reluctant]{.underline}** to support Ukraine and other threatened
Eastern European allies, and the United States now bogged down in the
Middle East, [China makes a]{.underline} **[bold move]{.underline}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} shutting [[the]{.underline}
**[Philippines]{.underline}**]{.mark}' access to the South China Sea
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} reasserts the reunification with
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the latter, it sends troops into
Taiwan to assert its control and effectively takes over Taipei.

The [[confluence]{.mark} of these "hot wars" [elevates]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[risk of]{.mark} regional conflict
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, exemplified by the potential for a
North Korean attack on South Korea. Moreover, [the]{.underline}
**[[spectre]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a full-scale global conflict
[[looms]{.underline}]{.mark} large. While the threat [[of]{.underline}
**[nuclear annihilation]{.underline}**]{.mark} may serve as a deterrent
to the indiscriminate use of nuclear weapons, its effectiveness in
preventing such catastrophic scenarios remains uncertain.

Pathway 4b: Multipolar Cold War

While regional and proxy conflicts persist, they have not escalated to
the point of dominating all international relations or directly
involving the large nuclear powers. However, these **[[persistent
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [coupled with ongoing]{.underline}
economic and technological [tensions]{.underline}, have [[led to]{.mark}
a]{.underline} [**[general]{.underline}** [erosion of
coop]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration]{.underline}. For example, China's
trend toward an economic slowdown materializes nto a recession spurred
on by high state-level debt, demographic decline, overproduction of
manufactured goods being blocked in Western states, deflation, and
further decoupling away from the West and the United States. This
becomes an enormous drag on global economic growth, leading to a global
recession. As China is a key consumer of the world's oil supply, this
has knock-on effects on many Arab Gulf countries and the recession
spreads further. China's economic recession is compounded by deep
structural challenges, including the middle-income trap and a declining
population, which lead to lower economic growth rates and eventually
send the global economy into a tailspin. The risk of fragmentation into
competing geoeconomic blocs, as under scenario 3, becomes realized as
countries raise their trade barriers, restrict foreign direct investment
and increase subsidies to their respective domestic industries.

[**[Hot wars]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}

**Harari '18** \[Yuval; September 26; Professor of History at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem; \"We need a post-liberal order now,\"
https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now\]

[If the **liberal order is collapsing**, what new kind of global order
might [replace]{.mark} it?]{.underline} So far, [those who challenge
[the liberal order]{.mark}]{.underline} do so mainly on a national
level. They have many ideas about how to advance the interests of their
particular country, but they [don't have a viable vision for how the
world as a whole should function]{.underline}. For example, Russian
nationalism can be a reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia,
but Russian nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of
course, nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to
conquer and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist
movements indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's
nationalists, whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain
from advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, [some
nationalists]{.underline} such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They [argue]{.underline} that all
nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

[The world will]{.underline} then [be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, [the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. **All
attempts** to divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}
so far **[[resulted in war]{.mark} and genocide]{.underline}**. When the
heirs of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the
multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line
dividing Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny
the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
three [common [problems]{.mark} that make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that can **[only]{.mark} be [solved
through]{.mark} global [cooperation]{.mark}**. These are **[nuclear war,
climate change and tech]{.mark}nological disruption**. You cannot build
a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming, and no nation
can regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or
bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only
the European Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[[An **AI**]{.mark} **arms race** [or]{.mark} a
**[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[**[guarantees]{.mark} the worst outcome**. Whoever wins]{.underline}
the arms race, **[the loser will likely be [humanity]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms race, [all regulations [will
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for example, conducting
genetic-engineering experiments on human babies. Every country will say:
"We don't want to conduct such experiments---we are the good guys. But
how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We cannot afford to remain
behind. So we must do it before them."

Similarly, [consider developing autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline},
that can decide for themselves whether to shoot and kill people. Again,
[every country will say: "This]{.underline} is a very dangerous
technology, and it [should be regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we
don't trust our rivals to regulate it, so we must develop it
first]{.underline}".

[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline} such [destructive arms
races is **[greater trust]{.mark} between countries**. This [is
**not**]{.mark} **an [impossible]{.mark} mission**]{.underline}. If
today the Germans promise the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing
killer robots in a secret laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the
French are likely to believe the Germans, despite the terrible history
of these two countries. [We need to build such trust
globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point when Americans and
Chinese can trust one another like the French and Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the 21st
century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective global
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only**]{.mark}
**viable [blueprint]{.mark}** for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered
by **[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world
are undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and
the world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel
the impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually [the **whole of humankind** will **feel
the squeeze**]{.underline}.

### ILO Scenario -- AT Decline Inevitable

#### Decline not inevitable -- Russia's invasion of Ukraine stopped the retreat of the ILO

Lucan **Way**, April **2022**, Journal of Democracy, 33(2), "The rebirth
of the Liberal World Order?",
https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rebirth-of-the-liberal-world-order/,
mm

After more than a decade of democratic malaise, the invasion has both
weakened [Russia's]{.underline} global status and [produced an
unprecedented degree of unity in the liberal world,]{.underline} driven
by both moral outrage and existential security threats. But what does
all this mean for the future of democracy? Security threats and moral
indignation did not enhance democracy after 9/11. In addition, during
the Cold War, Soviet security threats often undermined democratic
development by encouraging support for anticommunist dictators in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It is also worth emphasizing that the
conflict is still very young. The military trajectory of the war could
easily shift in Russia's favor. Furthermore, the dual strains of the
mass influx of Ukrainian refugees and European economic pain created by
sanctions could test Western unity and create a future wellspring of
populism. Yet [there are]{.underline} several [reasons to think that the
new context will strengthen democracy]{.underline} in Europe and perhaps
elsewhere. First, [the Cold War motivated investment in transnational
liberal institutions]{.underline} such as the European Union, which in
turn became a driver for the spread of democracy to Spain and Greece.30
The current conflict is similarly likely to encourage increased
commitment to the European project. Furthermore, in contrast to 9/11,
[the invasion has drawn sharp battle lines between]{.underline}
authoritarian [Russia]{.underline} [on one side and a community of
democratic states]{.underline} supporting Ukraine's imperiled democracy
[on the other]{.underline}. The conflict may make it harder for European
leaders to tolerate Orbán and other autocrats in the European Union.
Russia's invasion has not only heightened awareness of the dangers
generated by nationalism and illiberalism, but it has also linked them
to a broader existential threat posed by Russian autocracy to European
security. This threat is unlikely to diminish anytime soon. [The
heightened stakes will make it more costly for]{.underline} politicians
such as [Trump]{.underline} or Orbán [to condemn]{.underline} blithely
[the international liberal order.]{.underline} More than sixty years
after the horrors of World War II inspired the creation of the European
Union, the invasion has again reminded the world of the brutal human
cost brought about by the rejection of liberal values. Democracy is not
simply an abstract good but has important implications for human
welfare. While greater pluralism may not generate greater economic
growth or reduce levels of corruption, it does allow societies to avoid
the kind of brutal violence we see today in Ukraine and, to an
increasing extent, in Russia. [The conflict may]{.underline} also
[facilitate liberal development by fragmenting the authoritarian
international]{.underline} and drastically undermining the
attractiveness of the Russian path. [Even if Russia ekes out a military
victory]{.underline} in Ukraine, [the country is likely to have far
fewer resources]{.underline} to project its influence abroad. Putinism
will not be seen as a viable model for either building a prosperous
society or generating stable autocracy. No matter what the future holds,
this unjust and unprovoked invasion has been catastrophic for Ukraine
and its people. Still, [there remains a chance that the global liberal
project may emerge from this darkness stronger and more invigorated than
before]{.underline}.

### AT Unilat Bad/Conflict Turn - General

#### Unilateral geoengineering spurs multilateral cooperation -- fears of conflict are unrealistic

Joshua **Horton**, **2013**, "Geoengineering and the Myth of
Unilateralism: Pressures and Prospects for International Cooperation,"
Climate Change Geoengineering: Philosophical Perspectives, Legal Issues,
and Governance Frameworks, Cambridge University Press, p. 168-181, mm

[Policy makers]{.underline} and analysts [worry about the effects of
unilateral deployment on international peace and stability]{.underline}.
Unilateral geoengineering is viewed as a challenge to the international
order, in terms of both legitimacy and security, in a way reminiscent of
nuclear proliferation.8 Climate scientists have also noted concerns
about unilateral geoengineering.9 For instance, Lawrence states: \[I\]t
is easy to imagine a future scenario in which certain nations begin to
undertake large-scale geoengineering efforts on their own. It is not
uncommon for nations to act unilaterally in what they perceive as their
own best interests, regardless of any international outcry about the
consequences for the rest of the world.10 Lawrence continues:
\[W\]ithout a good overview of potential geoengineering efforts which
might eventually be undertaken, it would be difficult to monitor for the
possibility of "covert" geoengineering\.... a clear line will need to be
drawn between allowed scientific experiments which are small-scale yet
large enough to have statistically significant signals, and what goes
beyond this, so that "science" cannot be used as camouflage for
unilateral attempts to undertake large-scale geoengineering efforts.11
Not only do members of the scientific community echo fears articulated
by policy analysts, they express concern that unilateral climate
interventions might undermine the integrity of the scientific process by
parading as experimental in nature. The conduct of nominally
"scientific" nuclear research by international pariah states stands as a
cautionary tale in this regard. [Opponents of geoengineering have used
the unilateral scenario to argue against]{.underline} research and
[deployment]{.underline}. ETC Group is arguably the most outspoken
critic of geoengineering, and has identified "unilateral" as one of the
"Best Reasons to Say No to Geoengineering."12 The organization argues:
It has been well established in the Stockholm Declaration (1972), the
Rio Declaration (1992), the precedent-setting Trail Smelter case and in
the UNFCCC \[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\]
itself that states are obliged to ensure that "activities within their
jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other
states or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction." The
widely acknowledged potential for unilateral geoengineering deployment
flies of the face of this principle.13 Undoubtedly, many of those
scientists, policy analysts, and others who have raised the issue of
unilateralism have done so not with the intent to inhibit geoengineering
research and possible implementation, but rather to consider
unilateralism as one potential complicating factor in any effort to
deploy geoengineering technology. Nevertheless,
[speculation]{.underline} about unilateral intervention [has
injected]{.underline} an element of [fear into the climate
debate]{.underline}, [and been warmly received by those opposed to
geoengineering for **primarily ideological reasons**]{.underline}. Given
the present stakes, [it is important to show that the specter of
unilateral deployment is **largely illusory**]{.underline}, [and that
multilateral cooperation is the outcome favored by events]{.underline}.
Put simply, unilateral geoengineering deployment is unlikely to occur
because the incentives faced by states do not support it. To
illustrate[, suppose Country B has both an interest in geoengineering
deployment and the capacity to carry it out.]{.underline} In the present
case, deployment would take the form of a stratospheric aerosol
injection system. Country B would confront a multiplicity of practical
constraints. First, the relative simplicity and affordability of
stratospheric aerosol injection technology would make it widely
available to members of the international community.14 Other states or
international bodies might inject stratospheric aerosols just as easily
as Country B does. Given climate dynamics, multiple injections would
interact in a variety of ways. Specifically, the results of aerosol
injections by Country B would necessarily be mediated by the number of
additional injection projects, the volumes of aerosols injected, the
types of aerosols injected, the timing and phasing of other injections,
and the location of injection sites.15 The effects of such intervening
variables are potentially large and would likely frustrate any
deployment plan that failed to take them into account. For example, [one
of the most common proposals]{.underline} for stratospheric aerosol
injection [involves regional deployment designed to stabilize the
climate in the Arctic]{.underline}, including the Greenland ice sheet.16
Preliminary models indicate that isolated, high-latitude aerosol
dispersals would combine with the increased poleward water vapor
transport characteristic of global warming to produce greater snowfall
in the Arctic region.17 [This would result in enhanced regional
albedo]{.underline} (reflectivity), [reinforced snowpack, and moderated
climate change in the north polar region]{.underline}. However,
stratospheric injections carried out simultaneously at lower latitudes
(by, say, a low-lying island state facing an existential threat from sea
level rise) would have the effect of reducing water vapor transport,
which in turn would reduce Arctic precipitation, reverse snowpack gains,
and leave ice sheets in a deteriorating state. In the absence of
international coordination, a regional Arctic rescue plan could come
undone as a result of otherwise good intentions. Aerosol chemistry
provides another example. The aerosol most commonly suggested for
stratospheric injection is sulfuric acid.18 Plans call for delivering
sulfate aerosols by dispersing gas-phase precursor materials. Precursor
oxidation and aerosol formation involve complex processes with the
potential to reduce the effectiveness of stratospheric insertion. For
instance, coagulation could lead to excessively large sulfuric acid
particles that sediment out of the stratosphere, lessening the effect of
the initial dispersion.19 Multiple independent injections would increase
the likelihood of such unintended consequences. Unsynchronized staging,
scheduling, and delivery of sulfate aerosol injections would magnify the
potential for perverse particulate interactions, and might jeopardize
the success of geoengineering deployment. Lack of policy coordination
may result in separate injection schemes and mutual suboptimality. As
these cases illustrate, stratospheric aerosol injections by Country B
could not be kept separate from injections by other parties, and the
consequent interactions could undermine the effectiveness of Country B
deployment. [Simultaneous]{.underline} injection [schemes]{.underline}
carried out by multiple countries may be unlikely, but the possibility
is nontrivial, particularly given the technical simplicity and low cost
of injection systems. The widespread availability of stratospheric
injection technology, combined with its potential to hinder any
unilateral deployment, [provides strong incentives to coordinate
implementation plans at the international level]{.underline}. Second,
[other states may choose to pursue other types of geoengineering
activities, including alternative SRM strategies and Carbon Dioxide
Removal]{.underline} (CDR) [techniques]{.underline}. As in the case
described earlier in this section, parallel deployments of additional
geoengineering technologies would have the potential to interfere with
stratospheric injections by Country B. Consequently, Country B would
also need to ensure that its stratospheric aerosol deployment was
coordinated with any other geoengineering activities conducted by other
international actors. The pursuit of strategies such as marine cloud
whitening, ocean fertilization, artificial upwelling, etc. would affect
the outcome of stratospheric aerosol deployment by modifying regional
albedo, disrupting regional (and potentially global) circulation
patterns, altering atmospheric chemistry, and affecting nutrient cycles,
as well as in other less predictable ways.20 To maximize the chances of
success, [Country B would need to account for these complicating
factors]{.underline} in its aerosol injection plans, [monitor concurrent
climate interventions carried out by other actors]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [adjust]{.underline} stratospheric aerosol [deployment
schedules and timetables on an ongoing basis.]{.underline} Third, by
undertaking a stratospheric aerosol injection project, Country B would
be faced with the so-called termination problem: if emissions were not
reduced simultaneously, project termination would result in rapid
temperature increases and a destabilized climate system, so that in
effect Country B would be committed to aerosol injections
indefinitely.21 This dilemma would create pressure for Country B to
synchronize national deployment with international emissions mitigation
efforts.22 Unless its government was prepared to shoulder the burden of
deployment on an essentially permanent basis, in effect providing a
global public good, Country B would need to link deployment to a robust
global emissions reduction policy and a more general decarbonization of
the world economy.23 Fourth, the effects of deployment could be offset
with a variety of countermeasures. Though rarely mentioned in the
literature, states opposed to geoengineering have a number of tools at
their disposal to counteract climate interventions.24 In the case of
stratospheric aerosol injections, for example, fluorocarbon gases could
be deployed to offset cooling effects. Alternatively, the strategic use
of black carbon could neutralize artificial albedo enhancement. The
availability of effective countermeasures would serve as perhaps the
most potent check on unilateral deployment of geoengineering
technologies such as stratospheric aerosol injections. Thus, [the
incentive structure faced by a state interested in implementing a
climate intervention strategy would strongly discourage unilateral
postures that dismissed the need for international agreement and
coordination. Any country considering unilateral deployment would find
itself]{.underline} tangled in a web of technical and political
constraints and **[steered toward reaching some form of global
consensus.]{.underline}** [Individual incentives may be inadequate to
deter unilateralism on their own, but their collective weight is likely
to tilt the playing field decisively **in favor of multilateral
cooperation**]{.underline}. [For instance, Country B may be sufficiently
motivated to accept the costs]{.underline} associated with the
termination problem and dispense with efforts to synchronize emissions
mitigation policies. [But once deployed, a large number of international
actors would effectively exercise joint control over any injection
system]{.underline}, frustrating any attempt by Country B to pursue a
coherent climate intervention policy managed solely by its national
government. Furthermore, any actor opposed to the project could easily
(and anonymously) counter its effects using relatively simple means such
as release of black carbon, thereby neutralizing the entire scheme. This
situation is ultimately attributable to the highly complex nature of the
climate system.25 Climate dynamics are multivariate and interdependent,
determined by a range of factors including atmospheric and ocean
chemistry, albedo, atmospheric circulation, the hydrologic cycle, ocean
currents, vegetation coverage, biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen,
etc.), and solar effects. Feedback mechanisms and nonlinearity are
essential features of the climate system. Because climate complexity
renders the outcome of any geoengineering effort contingent on the
interplay of multiple natural (and anthropogenic) variables and
processes, success hinges on coordinated international intervention. In
other words[, geoengineering is ruled not by the threat of unilateral
deployment, but rather by a "logic of multilateralism"]{.underline}: in
a world of multiple, competing nation-states, nature dictates that
effective geoengineering and multilateral cooperation on climate
intervention are identical pursuits. [Any country that embarks on
unilateral implementation will soon find its efforts frustrated by
rivals and friends alike]{.underline}, whose actions across the entire
policy spectrum are inextricably linked via the global climate system.
The inherent complexity of the climate system makes the success of any
climate intervention singularly dependent on the behaviors that other
states do and do not engage in.26 Recognizing the true collective action
constraints associated with geoengineering removes the specter of
unilateralism from discussions of climate engineering. Furthermore[,
recognizing the multilateral logic that underlies the geoengineering
enterprise also points to a suite of diplomatic and institutional tools
with proven capacity to promote international cooperation]{.underline}.

#### International institutions are capable of managing disputes over SRM deployment -- Paris proves

Joshua **Horton et al.,** August **2018**, Global Environmental
Politics, 18(3), p. 5-24,
https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/18/3/5/14926/Solar-Geoengineering-and-Democracy,
mm

[The]{.underline} first of these [claims is that]{.underline}, due to
the high stakes involved, [interests supporting SRM]{.underline} \[solar
radiation management\] [would be]{.underline} so entrenched and
disagreements so intractable that democratic norms, practices, and
institutions would be unable to resolve fundamental differences. Weighed
down and [compromised by irresolvable conflicts, political instability,
and contested notions of the public good]{.underline}, democratic
institutions would prove incapable of governing. This assertion is built
on three subclaims. [The]{.underline} first [subclaim is that SRM
would]{.underline} inevitably "[cause conflicts within existing
institutions]{.underline}" (Szerszynski et al. 2013, 2811). Parties
would disagree about whether and how to use it, who would conduct it,
conditions for cessation, compensation provisions, claims of
attribution, and prior consent. [Some]{.underline} commentators [have
argued that because SRM would produce uneven regional climate effects,
it would necessarily result in winners and losers.]{.underline} While
the magnitude of this issue is currently unclear, [even if SRM were to
distribute gains and losses unequally, it would not differ fundamentally
in this respect from conventional responses to climate
change]{.underline}. Governing institutions decided in [the Paris
Agreement]{.underline} to try to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or
even 1.5 degrees. Achieving this [would result in an unequal
distribution of gains and losses]{.underline} when compared with higher,
lower, or no warming targets. [Similarly, SRM might be implemented to
limit warming]{.underline} to 1.5 or 2 degrees, to reduce the rate of
climate change, or to eliminate it as much as possible. [Each of these
objectives]{.underline}, if achieved, [would have unequal
impacts]{.underline} relative to other targets. [Those]{.underline}
[arguing for incompatibility have also asserted that attribution of
cause and effect would be impossible with SRM, making liability and
accountability for its effects impossible]{.underline}. [Researchers
have made progress in attributing specific events to anthropogenic
climate change using probabilistic methods]{.underline} (Stott et al.
2016), [and this knowledge could be extended to SRM (]{.underline}Horton
et al. 2015, 225). There are also ways of dealing with compensation that
avoid attribution, such as through compensation funds (Reynolds 2015;
Wong et al. 2014).

#### Trump's support for Arctic geoengineering would generate international momentum in favor of the technology 

Hugh **Hunt** **and** Shaun **Fitzgerald**, 2/18/**25**, The
Conversation, "Geoengineering is politically off-limits - could a Trump
presidency change that?"
https://phys.org/news/2025-02-geoengineering-politically-limits-trump.html,
mm

Donald [Trump\'s]{.underline} [second]{.underline} presidential [term is
likely to mean big changes for those of us interested in
geoengineering]{.underline}. The term refers to deliberate large-scale
manipulation of the climate, perhaps by blocking out some sunlight or
directly removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Sometimes called
climate engineering, we prefer the term \"climate repair.\" Trump is not
the most natural supporter of climate change interventions. He is set to
expand oil and gas production hot on the heels of the most terrible
wildfires in California. At some point, the US could see hurricanes on
scales even more extreme than Katrina or Helene. Extreme weather will
become harder to ignore. Trump could, of course, downplay any link to
climate change, but there\'s a chance this might trigger him to decide
emergency action is required and demand to know more about climate
engineering options. After all, [Trump is close to certain tech figures
who like big technological solutions to global problems]{.underline}. He
likes to act fast and is prepared to deal with democratic reactions
later. In those circumstances, he might feel that we should do whatever
it takes to deploy new climate-saving strategies at speed.
[The]{.underline} [most effective methods for cooling the planet involve
making the Earth more reflective]{.underline} so that it absorbs less
heat from the sun. One option, known as stratospheric aerosol injection,
involves spraying sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to mimic the
cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. [Clouds]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} also [be altered to become more
reflective]{.underline}, [an option known as marine cloud
brightening]{.underline}. [We can even make ice in the Arctic more
reflective by thickening it during the winter months]{.underline} so
that it lasts longer in the summer, reflecting the sun\'s heat back into
space. These technologies sound rather fanciful. Some might find them
scary. But with the devastation of hurricanes and wildfires, [Trump
could]{.underline} potentially [instruct the US military to
give]{.underline} aerosol injection [a go]{.underline}. At present, the
technology would rely on high-altitude jets to take millions of tons of
sulfur dioxide up to the stratosphere above the Arctic, and the US has a
lot of these planes. Alternatively, Trump might take the opposite path
and say \"this is just part of the natural cycle of weather\".
Climate-change deniers or those who believe reducing emissions alone
will work to hit the 1.5°C or even 2°C targets may be given a platform
to convince us all that there is no need for geoengineering. Maybe there
is a middle ground. Trump could decide to support geoengineering
research to help the insurance industry. If insurance companies will
benefit by having fewer storms and fires, then this would be good for
the US economy. So perhaps some expenditure on research right now may be
a strategic investment. Behind the scenes are deep discussions on
geoengineering governance. There are some who argue that geoengineering
is so risky for the climate (what if the world cools too much? are we
prepared for any unintended consequences?) that it shouldn\'t be
researched---or at least the research should not be funded by
governments. Others argue that global governance and democratic issues
(who is in charge? who gets a say?) need to be addressed before any
research can begin. Then there\'s the \"slippery slope\" argument, that
once we start then we\'ll never stop. Until now these kinds of arguments
have slowed the pace of research, but Trump could say that the current
position is wrong, as it holds back our knowledge of something which
might help the US economy. [If Trump decides to unlock geoengineering as
an opportunity, then he may]{.underline} not just provide funding but
[instruct the national labs to get on with research at
pace]{.underline}, thereby accelerating our knowledge of the different
options. With good data we can make informed decisions. How much would
this cost? It turns out that geoengineering research is not very
expensive and Trump may figure that the potential upside is huge. If he
gets excited about it, then geoengineering might suddenly capture the
imagination of the US public. [There is increased interest around the
world, so the situation in the US **is being watched
closely**]{.underline}. [With additional funding and instructions from
the new presiden]{.underline}t, [geoengineering would soon **become
established in the mainstream**]{.underline}.

#### U.S. support for solar geoengineering will strengthen international governance norms

Richard **Haass** and Carolyn **Kissane**, 2/20/**25**, Australian
Strategic Policy Institute, "Tackling climate change in the age of
Trump,"

mm

There is no denying the reality of global warming. Each year is hotter
than the preceding one. Last month alone was the hottest January on
record. Recurring natural disasters---floods, fires, droughts and
hurricanes---are becoming more extreme and frequent. The world has blown
through the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C above the
pre-industrial level. At this rate, climate change could define the
second half of this century. National and international [efforts to stem
climate change are not succeeding]{.underline}. The Global South views
the problem as one that ought to be fixed by richer countries that
developed sooner. [Many countries]{.underline}, including China,
[prioritise]{.underline} near-term economic [growth over
reducing]{.underline} greenhouse-gas [emissions]{.underline}, and
freeriding on other governments' efforts is widespread, partly owing to
public opposition to taxes that could curb energy use or encourage
climate-conscious behaviours. Since returning to the White House, Donald
[Trump]{.underline} [has led the United States swiftly into this
camp]{.underline}, withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement,
rescinding emissions-reduction targets and ending climate-related
initiatives. His administration is focussed on increasing fossil-fuel
production, even though the US is already the world's leading producer
of oil and gas and has only modest potential to increase output. The
reasons are not only economic but also cultural and political, with many
Americans resenting or rejecting experts' climate warnings. The good
news, though, is that [a range of potential initiatives
that]{.underline} [are consistent with the Trump administration's
priorities could still slow climate change]{.underline}. Those who
acknowledge the seriousness of the climate crisis can repeat the same
arguments, attend the same global conferences and advocate for the same
policies in the hope that at some point what has mostly failed will
mostly succeed. But they would be better off trying a different
approach, one that reflects political realities in the US and around the
world but could still make a meaningful difference. Such an approach
must begin with realistic goals. Climate change can be managed, not
stopped or solved. Global emissions continue to rise, fossil fuels still
account for 80 percent of world energy use and talk of a transition away
from them is mostly just that: talk. And energy use will only continue
to increase as the global population increases, Africa develops,
electrification expands and new data centres required for artificial
intelligence are built. Given this, embracing energy coexistence is
unavoidable. Fossil fuels will be here for decades to come. While
developed countries are abandoning coal (albeit not completely), its use
in the developing world continues to increase, where the goal should be
to accelerate the shift toward cleaner natural gas. The same holds for
practices that limit methane emissions. Renewables are growing in
importance and should be encouraged through public-private partnerships.
There is no reason that a US president prepared to be tough on China
should allow it to dominate green technological innovation. The private
sector, which has made enormous investments and stands to gain from
future ones, should weigh in. Policymakers should also emphasise
adaptation and resilience at the national, state and local levels.
Building codes and zoning regulations need to be rethought to limit
vulnerability to climate-related extreme heat, fires, storms and
flooding. Investment in such infrastructure could create jobs and make
it possible for people to live where they want. Solutions that increase
the efficiency of the energy grid, water systems and household
appliances should also be adopted. Here, Elon Musk's Department of
Government Efficiency (DOGE) should weigh in. Likewise, a feasible
climate-change policy must treat nuclear energy as indispensable for
achieving reliable clean power. This can only happen by streamlining
permitting processes to accelerate deployment of new reactors. China is
building nuclear plants in under five years; there is no good reason the
US cannot match this. Similarly, roadblocks to much needed renewable
projects, mining of critical minerals and development of energy
infrastructure ought to be reduced. Here, too, DOGE could have a role to
play. The federal government and states (together with companies) should
also invest in technologies such as direct air capture, better scrubbing
systems for coal plants and carbon capture, utilisation, sequestration
and storage. Again, there is no reason that economic growth must be
sacrificed. A greater focus on what communities and cities can do to
reduce their vulnerability to fires, floods and the like can help manage
the effects of climate change without engaging the ideological debate.
It would also help to engage new climate allies, including religious
leaders, educators and business leaders. Many young people are already
there. At the same time, global efforts should be restructured. The
annual United Nations climate change conferences are falling short. What
is needed are smaller groups (what some call minilateralism) focussing
on specific aspects of the climate challenge and involving the
governments and companies that matter most. Trade offers a model here:
whereas global efforts have failed, regional and other small clusters
have flourished. Nature-based climate stewardship of the oceans and
forests is also needed, because it preserves and expands the most
powerful carbon sinks. Assistance of all sorts should be channelled to
encourage forestation and halt or slow deforestation. Trump considers
himself an environmentalist. Here is a way he can act on it. Lastly,
[solar geoengineering]{.underline}, or reflecting solar radiation back
into space, [deserves more exploration. Federal investment through US
national labs could ensure **responsible development and
governance**]{.underline}. While controversial, [it]{.underline}
represents the kind of bold, game-changing initiative that [should
appeal to Trump]{.underline}. If successful, [solar geoengineering
could]{.underline} one day meaningfully [slow]{.underline} or stop
additional [climate change]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even
[offset]{.underline} some [existing effects]{.underline}. And even if
its promise proves to be less dramatic, the technology could complement
existing and planned mitigation and adaptation efforts.

### AT Unilat Bad/Conflict Turn -- China/Russia Supports Geoengineering

#### No war over geoengineering -- China and Russia support it

Clive **Hamilton**, 9/24/**13**, The Guardian, "Why geoengineering suits
Russia's carbon agenda,"
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/24/why-geoengineering-suits-russias-carbon-agenda,
mm

News that [Russia is calling for geoengineering]{.underline} be
considered by the IPCC as a possible response to global warming makes a
perverse kind of sense. No government, not even those of Canada and
Australia, has been more eager to open up new sources of fossil energy
than Russia's. [By offsetting the effects of global warming]{.underline}
-- by, for example, coating the Earth with a layer of sulphate particles
to reduce the amount of sunlight -- [geoengineering promises to allow
the world to have its carbon cake and eat it.]{.underline} The
contradictions of geoengineering appear most starkly in the Arctic.
Melting summer sea ice has made the Arctic global warming's canary in
the coal-mine, the place that most keeps climate scientists awake at
night. Yet the Arctic, a large portion of which is controlled or claimed
by Russia, is a new carbon El Dorado, holding up to a quarter of the
globe's undiscovered oil and gas reserves. According to one energy
industry insider: \"Climate change is opening up one of the last
frontiers for hydrocarbons on our planet. The Arctic ... could be set
for rapid change and development as exploration, production and
infrastructure will have an inevitable, irreversible impact.\" In a
provocative move, in 2007 a Russian submarine managed to plant the
national flag on the seabed under the North Pole, and a year later the
Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, declared: \"Our first and main task
is to turn the Arctic into Russia's resource base of the 21st century.\"
He was not talking about solar collectors. The Russian government's
determination to prevent obstacles to get in the way of Arctic
exploitation was demonstrated last week when commandos boarded a
Greenpeace ship and pointed guns at the activists' heads. Russia's
control over exports of gas and oil to Europe is its biggest strategic
bargaining chip. Its bullying of former Soviet satellite states is well
known, but even Germany's dependence on Russia for over a third of its
oil and gas supplies is enough to lead a military-linked thinktank to
urge the Merkel government to soft-pedal in its diplomatic dealings with
its eastern neighbour. [Global efforts to reverse the world's dependence
on fossil fuels threaten Russia's plans for its economic and strategic
future.]{.underline} Challenging IPCC science would marginalise it from
the global negotiations, [so carrying the torch for
geoengineering]{.underline} -- it would be the first nation to do so --
[has a kind of logic to it]{.underline}. In 2010, Russia joined with
Japan in an attempt to water down a resolution to restrict research into
geoengineering at a meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
In pursuing the climate engineering agenda, a Russian government is
likely to face fewer domestic constraints than more developed
democracies. Pro-geoengineering analysts writing for a US conservative
thinktank have argued that nations with weak environmental lobbies
(meaning China and Russia) will be able to deploy \"solar radiation
management\" with muted internal opposition. This, they wrote, is one of
its advantages. If true, [solar radiation management is the dictator's
technology of choice]{.underline}. [China, increasingly fearful of
environmental catastrophe, has recently included geoengineering among
its earth sciences research priorities. There is a long history of
attempted weather modification in Russia]{.underline}, especially as
part of the cold war arms race. In 1960, in a book titled Man versus
Climate, two Russian meteorologists matched American technological
hubris when they wrote: \"Today we are merely on the threshold of the
conquest of nature. But if ... the reader is convinced that man can
really be the master of this planet and that the future is in his hands,
then the authors will consider that they have fulfilled their purpose.\"
The world's most vigorous proponent of geoengineering is the Russian
scientist Yuri Izrael. As director of the Research Institute of Global
Climate and Ecology at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, he was
the first to carry out tests of aerosol spraying, albeit at low
altitudes from helicopters, to gather data on the optical
characteristics of various particles. Izrael is said to have been close
to President Putin. Although an IPCC vice-chair until 2008, Izrael at
times gives the impression of being a climate science denier. He invited
the guru of American deniers, Richard Lindzen, to a conference of the
Russian Academy of Science in 2004 and himself featured at a 2008
conference of the Heartland Institute, which was excoriated last year
after it compared climate scientists to the Unabomber. Izrael has
variously claimed that warming will not be harmful, that the Kyoto
protocol has 'no scientific basis', and that it would be cheaper to
resettle Bangladeshis threatened by sea-level rise. And he argues for
geoengineering instead of emission cuts. Other scientists in Russia seem
embarrassed by his antics and describe him as a \"fossil communist\",
but he remains influential. Izrael has frequently collaborated with
Andrei Illarionov, once President Putin's top economic adviser. Invoking
nationalist resentments Illarionov described the Kyoto protocol as war
against Russia. In the Moscow Times he wrote that it was killing off the
world economy like an \"international Auschwitz\". There are some more
reasonable Russian voices talking about geoengineering, including a
handful of scientists modeling the impacts of sulphate aerosol spraying.
However, they argue that geoengineering is inevitable because carbon
emissions are growing by more than the IPCC's most pessimistic
projections: \"Therefore, humankind will be forced to apply
geoengineering to counter the unwanted consequences of global warming.\"
It's an argument echoed in the text now being put forward by Russia to
modify the summary of the latest IPCC report. In 2009 I met a Siberian
meteorologist at a conference. She told me that many people in Siberia
would welcome a couple of degrees of warming. She knew enough about how
the Earth system works to understand that any benefits from warming
would be fleeting, as the Earth is unlikely to call a convenient halt
once it reaches that threshold, and certainly not once the Arctic has
thawed. But that is a piece of science many have yet to learn.

### AT Unilat Bad/Conflict Turn -- Climate Risk O/W

#### Climate change is a threat multiplier -- outweighs any risk of international disputes caused by solar geoengineering

https://srm360.org/article/could-srm-be-weaponised/, mm

[It is difficult to see how any leading]{.underline} SRM [\[sunlight
reflection methods\] idea could be used as a weapon of war.]{.underline}
Unlike guns, bombs, missiles, and a staggering array of other
technologies, SRM simply lacks the precision, accuracy, and reliability
that are essential elements of effective weapons. [Yet]{.underline}
while SRM may not be weaponisable, it could still cause international
instability. For instance, [if one country felt that its rights were
violated by another country using SRM, the "victim" country might
threaten to attack the "aggressor" country]{.underline}. [However, its
potential effects on international relations are uncertain.]{.underline}
[To the extent that climate change acts as a "threat
multiplier",]{.underline} [exacerbating international tensions over
economic, political, and security issues, offsetting some climate
impacts through SRM might even enhance security.]{.underline}

### AT International Law Turn -- AT Link

#### International law does not prohibit the deployment of SRM

Josh **Horton**, 11/26/**24**, SRM360, \[Josh is a Senior Program
Fellow, Solar Geoengineering, at Harvard Kennedy School, and conducts
wide-ranging research on the national and international governance of
SRM research and potential deployment.\], "Does International Law
Prohibit SRM?"
https://srm360.org/article/does-international-law-prohibit-srm/, mm

SRM interventions -- if they were undertaken -- would affect the global
climate system, and thus every country on Earth. Since some effects of
SRM could be harmful, the question arises: [does international law
prohibit SRM]{.underline} research, field experiments, or
[deployment?]{.underline} Simply put, international law is law among
states. [There are]{.underline} [two]{.underline} main [types of binding
international law: customary]{.underline} international [law and treaty
law]{.underline}. Customary international law consists of legal
obligations among all states that derive from practice. For example,
according to the customary "no-harm rule", states have duties to
minimise or at least reduce significant environmental harms to other
states. They also have obligations to conduct environmental impact
assessments where appropriate. While customary international law is
binding on all states, it lacks detail and can be open to
interpretation. [Most legal scholars find no evidence to suggest that
customary international law categorically prohibits SRM]{.underline}.1
Treaty law, as its name suggests, consists of legal obligations arising
from treaties signed and ratified by states. Unlike customary
international law, [treaty law is binding only on those states that have
ratified it]{.underline}.2 [The United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change]{.underline} is the principal treaty governing climate
change and the framework within which the Paris Agreement was developed,
but it [does not address SRM]{.underline} specifically.3 Instead, SRM
has been addressed in piecemeal fashion by a handful of other treaties
related to the environment. The table below summarises this patchwork
coverage. In 2010, [states party to the Convention on Biological
Diversity]{.underline} (CBD), which aims to protect global biodiversity,
[adopted a decision urging countries to prevent "climate-related
geo-engineering]{.underline} activities \[including SRM\] that may
affect biodiversity" -- with the exception of "small scale scientific
research studies" -- until there is adequate scientific justification
and appropriate consideration of risks and impacts.4 Some people refer
to this decision as an international "moratorium". But [since it is a
decision rather than an amendment, it is not legally
binding]{.underline} -- even on states that have ratified the CBD.5
[Furthermore, the]{.underline} United States [(US) is not a party to the
CBD]{.underline}. Regardless, most informed commentators reject the
notion that the CBD prohibits SRM because its parties are under no
obligation to do so.6 The London Convention and London Protocol regulate
ocean dumping.7 In 2013, negotiators finalised an amendment to the
London Protocol that would prohibit specific listed "marine
geoengineering" activities with a possible exception for "legitimate
scientific research".8 As written, this amendment would apply only to
ocean fertilisation, which aims to capture carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere by stimulating phytoplankton blooms. However, [states that
have ratified the London Protocol are currently considering whether to
list marine cloud brightening as a form of marine
geoengineering]{.underline} under the terms of the amendment. [Yet this
2013 amendment has not entered into force]{.underline} -- only 6 of a
required 36 countries have ratified it. And if it ever did enter into
force and consequently became legally binding, the amendment does not
currently address SRM. [Further]{.underline}, as in the case of the CBD,
[the US is not a party to the London Protocol.]{.underline} Again, as
with the CBD, legal scholars acknowledge that the London Protocol does
not prohibit SRM.9 The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any
Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, or
[ENMOD]{.underline}, was signed in 1977. The treaty
[prohibits]{.underline} [the "hostile" use of environmental modification
techniques,]{.underline} and such techniques would clearly include SRM.
[Suggested uses of SRM, however, seem unlikely to be hostile in
character]{.underline}.10 Moreover, SRM does not appear to be capable of
being weaponised. In any case, [ENMOD is an inactive treaty -- its
parties have not met since 1992 and have no plans to do so]{.underline}.
While it might seem that international law ought to prohibit the use of
SRM, neither customary international law nor any treaty does so. Some
indications of at least limited support for banning SRM should be noted.
Following unauthorised balloon releases carried out in Mexico by the US
start-up company "Make Sunsets" in 2022, the Mexican government
announced its intention to prohibit SRM and rally other countries to
take similar steps.11 And at a meeting of the United Nations Environment
Assembly in 2024, African countries pushed for the "non-use" of SRM, but
were unsuccessful due to lack of support. While support for prohibiting
the use of SRM may grow in the future, for now, [international law poses
no strong barriers to SRM.]{.underline}

#### Solar geoengineering is not precluded by international law

Jesse **Reynolds**, **2021**, "Solar Geoengineering Could Be Consistent
With International Law," Debate Climate Law (eds. Benoit Mayer and
Alexander Zahar), pps. 257-273, mm

[Solar geoengineering would entail the use of territory and natural
resources. A state's sovereignty over its territory is arguably the
foundation of international law]{.underline}.Footnote21 States also have
permanent sovereignty over their natural resources. [This has been
expressed in multiple UN]{.underline} General Assembly
[resolutions]{.underline}Footnote22 [and confirmed as a rule of
customary international]{.underline} [law]{.underline} by the
International Court of Justice (ICJ).Footnote23 Sovereignty is not
absolute: states are constrained by international legal obligations.
[Solar geoengineering would affect other states'
environments.]{.underline} The foundational Stockholm and Rio
Declarations couple states' 'sovereign right to exploit their own
resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental
policies' with their obligations regarding harm that would be
transboundary (that is, to other states or to areas beyond national
jurisdiction).Footnote24 The ICJ has recognized at least some of these
obligations as customary international law,Footnote25 although the
individual rules' precise contours and legal status are for the most
part somewhat unclear. [Regardless]{.underline}, pursuant to these, [the
source state need not prevent all transboundary environmental harm but
instead must comply with various, mostly procedural duties, such as
prior risk assessment, notification]{.underline} of [and]{.underline}
(if requested) [consultation]{.underline} [with potentially affected
states, and take appropriate substantive measures to prevent or minimize
risks]{.underline}.Footnote26 **[None of these duties preclude solar
geoengineering.]{.underline}** Ultimately, a state may undertake or
approve an action that causes transboundary risks or certain negative
impacts on other states. In fact, such actions occur
regularly.Footnote27 [The International Law Commission]{.underline}
(ILC), which codifies and helps develop international law, [has drafted
a set of Guidelines on the Protection of the Atmosphere]{.underline}.
The ILC intends that these reflect state practice and, to some degree,
customary international law. One of the guidelines is, 'Activities aimed
at intentional large-scale modification of the atmosphere should be
conducted with prudence and caution, subject to any applicable rules of
international law.'Footnote28 The accompanying commentary makes clear
that this is meant to include solar geoengineering.Footnote29 [If solar
geoengineering were contrary to international law, the ILC would have
said so in these guidelines]{.underline}.

#### Geoengineering is consistent with core environmental treaties

Jesse **Reynolds**, **2021**, "Solar Geoengineering Could Be Consistent
With International Law," Debate Climate Law (eds. Benoit Mayer and
Alexander Zahar), pps. 257-273, mm

States' more specific legal rights and obligations are found in
treaties. Although these are binding on only those states that have
ratified them, for the sake of argument I will assume that the
solar-geoengineering state has done so. [The]{.underline} seemingly
[most relevant set of treaties are the UNFCCC and its]{.underline} two
[related agreements]{.underline}. The UNFCCC's objective is worth
quoting at length: The ultimate objective ... is to achieve ...
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a
level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame
sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to
ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic
development to proceed in a sustainable manner.Footnote30 In an initial
reading of this, solar geoengineering does not fall within this scope,
as it would not directly affect atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations. Regardless of [the UNFCCC]{.underline}'s objective, its
lack of explicit provisions on the matter indicates that it [would not
prevent solar geoengineering as an exercise of state
sovereignty]{.underline}. [If anything, the climate change regime
actually encourages it, for five reasons. First, current evidence
suggests that solar geoengineering would indirectly reduce atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide]{.underline}, the leading greenhouse
gas.Footnote31 This is expected to occur largely by preventing some of
the positive CO2-releasing feedbacks that global warming will cause.
States' commitments in the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement
to enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases could thus apply
also to solar geoengineering.Footnote32 [Second]{.underline}, while the
UNFCCC's objective does not specify the levels at which atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases should be stabilized, it provides a
constraint on the level ('prevent\[ing\] dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system') and three constraints on the time
frame of their stabilization ('allow\[ing\] ecosystems to adapt ...,
ensur\[ing\] food production ..., and ... enabl\[ing\] sustainable
economic development to proceed'). [Solar geoengineering]{.underline},
as part of a diverse portfolio of responses, appears able to increase
the level at which greenhouse gases' atmospheric concentrations
[would]{.underline} constitute dangerous interference with the climate
system as well as to [allow more time for]{.underline} their
[stabilization]{.underline}. [Third, solar geoengineering could
reasonably be considered a form of adaptation]{.underline}, for which
the climate change agreements contain multiple commitments. Though these
treaties do not define adaptation, the UNFCCC institutions often refer
to a definition developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC): 'Adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social,
or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli
and their effects or impacts. It refers to changes in processes,
practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit
from opportunities associated with climate change.'Footnote33 Solar
geoengineering would be a change in practices to moderate potential
damages from climate change. If it were so included, parties'
commitments in the UNFCCCFootnote34 and the Paris AgreementFootnote35 to
take adaptive steps could include solar geoengineering. [Fourth, one of
the UNFCCC's foundational principles is precaution]{.underline}: The
Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or
minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects.
Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full
scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such
measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with
climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits
at the lowest possible cost.Footnote36 [Solar geoengineering could be a
precautionary response to climate]{.underline}
[change]{.underline}.Footnote37 It could mitigate many of its adverse
effects. Furthermore, if one were to understand climate change as the
product of an anthropogenic alteration of Earth's radiative energy
balance, solar geoengineering could prevent or minimize its cause.
Although full scientific certainty is still lacking, this should not be
used as a reason for postponing solar geoengineering, according to this
legal principle. And because solar geoengineering appears to have low
direct costs, it might be cost-effective.Footnote38 The precautionary
approach is found in other relevant multilateral environmental
statements and agreements, but these do not substantially differ from
that of the UNFCCC.Footnote39 [Fifth]{.underline} and finally, [the
Paris Agreement establishes a temperature goal]{.underline}, in which
parties seek [to keep global warming well below 2°C]{.underline} and
'pursue efforts' to limit it to 1.5°C.Footnote40 [Solar geoengineering
could contribute to achieving this objective, and the Agreement contains
no prohibitions or restrictions on parties using solar
geoengineering.]{.underline}

### AT International Law Turn -- AT Link -- Doctrine of Necessity

Jesse **Reynolds**, **2021**, "Solar Geoengineering Could Be Consistent
With International Law," Debate Climate Law (eds. Benoit Mayer and

[If a state that conducts geoengineering were to be accused by another
of acting in breach of its international legal obligations]{.underline},
[the accused state may invoke circumstances in which the customary
international law of state responsibility precludes an act from being
wrongful]{.underline}. [The most pertinent of these is
necessity]{.underline}, in which the act that would otherwise be
contrary to international law 'is the only way for the State to
safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril',
according to the ILC's Draft Articles.Footnote78 [Climate change will
threaten some states' essential interests,]{.underline} including the
very existence of low-lying island states. [A state could assert that
solar geoengineering is the only way for it to safeguard such an
essential interest, despite any possible ways in which the activities
might be contrary to international law]{.underline}.

And so [[international law is]{.underline}]{.mark}, and will continue to
be[, [generally recognised.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nation states will
continue to comply with obligations freely entered into by treaty or
other agreements. International organisations and legal instruments will
continue to exist despite the horrific violence in many places.
Countries will continue to recognise international law, when it suits
them[[.**But recognition is not the same as enforcement**]{.mark}**,**
and enforcement of a law---or sanction for its breach---against an
unwilling individual or entity is perhaps the ultimate test of any legal
order.]{.underline} Some legal commentators would insist that unless a
law or sanction is capable of ready enforcement then there is not a
meaningful legal order. In the words of the famous American jurist
Oliver Wendell Holmes, "The prophecies of what the courts will do in
fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law."
Following this dictum of Holmes, if one prophesises that variou[s
**[international courts]{.mark} and tribunals [will not]{.mark}
ultimately [do anything]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} adjudicate and
[punish]{.mark} any crimes of [Russia or Israel]{.mark} or any other
country committing atrocities, then one can say that international
law---at least in in those respects---does not exist. [I**nternational
law may** ]{.mark}**well otherwise [exist,]{.mark} [but it is making no
difference.]{.mark}**]{.underline}But whether or not an act of
aggression or mass killing is legal is often not the most important
question for the perpetuator. There is the question of its practical
purpose. There may also be a question of its moral justification. If an
act achieves (or is believed to achieve) a certain aim or accords with
some perceived ethical imperative, those responsible for lethal and
destructive acts can shrug at the prospect of a finding of
unlawfulness.[And **therein is the essential problem about the
enforcement, if not the recognition, of international law.** It can be
selective, if not one-sided: a high-sounding exercise in what is
essentially victor's justice.]{.underline} Not all war crimes are
committed by those who end up losing the conflict. There is also the
issue of standing: [[it is hard for powerfu]{.mark}l (or once powerful)
[states to]{.mark} convincingly [insist on legal fairness]{.mark} in
dealings with states and peoples that were until recently systemically
and cynically exploited]{.underline}.As Mahatma Gandhi said when asked
what he thought about western civilisation, [the [consistent
enforcement]{.mark} of international law on aggressive and abusive
countries [would be a "good idea"]{.mark}. **[And such enforcement is
now not happening]{.mark}**, at least in respect of certain
well-resourced aggressors. But that should not mean that all
international law is discredited: **most of [it]{.mark} mundanely plods
on without much notice**]{.underline}**.**[For international law to
prevail over reluctant and faithless national actors [**may never
happen**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It may require [international legal
instruments to be
amended](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/law/the-weekly-constitutional/70090/conservatives-the-echr-needs-practical-reform-not-quitting).
It will require the political leaders of countries to accept things they
do not want to accept. It will also require political and judicial
prudence and self-restraint. So it remains possible, even if it is
unlikely. [[**We are at a low point**]{.mark} in the story of the
postwar international order, [**even if** most countries continue
to]{.mark} recognise international law and [comply]{.mark} with
it.]{.underline} Major countries picking and choosing which rules to
follow and which ones to break is a striking feature of our age. This
disregard is stark and brazen. And it was telling that in its bombing of
Iran [the United States did not even attempt to justify the attack in
terms of international law.]{.underline} [For President Trump,
international vice does not need to offer any tribute to international
virtue.]{.underline}

#### No impact -- international law is rarely enforced

**Beuler 23** \[Phillips Academy's weekly student newspaper, The
phillipian, Why International Law Can't Work Yet,
https://phillipian.net/2023/09/28/why-international-law-cant-work-yet/\]
AP

International law has never been so frightening to states as domestic
law is to individuals. This is, of course, because international law
attempts to be a supernational force in a world of nations[. [With no
power, international law is]{.underline}]{.mark} [essentially [a
collection of well-meaning ideas and ideals that people or states will
throw around to show how the world is improving even though no one can
actually enforce international law.]{.mark} Instead, [it is hoped that
shared interest or some sort of honor agreement]{.mark} will keep
nations from breaching international law. It does not.]{.underline} But,
in its current state, I firmly believe that it is for the best that
international law continues to be relegated to lip service. This is not
to say that I do not believe in building moral international shared
norms and values ---- I do ---- but [[modern international law cannot
successfully come to a non-contradictory legal consensus on the simplest
of international conflicts.]{.underline}]{.mark} For any enforceable
implementation of international law to ever be considered, [the
foundational contradictions of the legal status quo must be
resolved.]{.underline} There is real promise in the idea of
international law in regard to international disputes. Territorial
disputes between nations, conflicts over Exclusive Economic Zones
(marine areas in which nations have exclusive economics rights), and
other interstate conflicts are all resolvable through international law,
perhaps through the application of international law or through the
ruling of an international court. Either way, international law can act
as a shared legal guideline for all parties involved, and international
courts can be an arbitrating party with relatively little bias for the
most part. Even to date, while [[international law has no enforcement
mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, nations regularly follow the rulings of
international courts. Now, of course, not all decisions made using
international courts or justified under international law are followed
by state actors, but the fact that "losing" parties would still follow
international law despite there being no force that implements them
shows real promise for what could come out of international law.
However, as useful as international law is in disputes between nations,
it is difficult to reconcile Westphalian conceptions of state
sovereignty with international law that is meant to regulate how states
treat their own citizens. How can we say that what a state does within
its borders is no business of any other state and simultaneously
regulate what that state does through international law? There are
obvious actions that states should not be allowed to take against their
citizens, and the moral rationale behind the "Universal Declaration of
Human Rights," all the "Covenants on Human Rights," and other similar
treaties is very clear, but [[the first major inconsistency in
international law comes here: if nations all agree that the internal
issues of every state are their own and every state is allowed to have
sovereignty, then by that logic international law should not seek to
regulate states.]{.underline}]{.mark} The fact of the matter is that the
Westphalian principles and system of international relations are
completely inconsistent with international law that seeks to limit the
power of states within their own borders. But I don't think this is a
reason to abandon international law as a concept. Instead, Westphalian
principles must either be altered to reflect the basic shared norms and
values of our increasingly globalized world or be thrown out entirely in
favor of a new system of international relations, one in which
international law has a greater role. But the worst contradiction of all
in international law is that of the right to self-determination versus
the Westphalian idea of sovereignty. To briefly explain, the right to
self-determination states very vaguely that all peoples have a right to
pursue their own "destiny" without outside interference. Whether this
means that people have a right to independence, autonomy, or something
else entirely is unclear. This first sort of indeterminacy has serious
implications for groups like the Kurds, who have tried to invoke their
right to self-determination across Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran
repeatedly in the hopes of gaining a state of their own. Often, if the
response is not an immediate crackdown on the Kurds, regional autonomy
is the most granted. If international law really wants to protect the
rights and desires of groups, there has to be less ambiguity in
precisely what the right to self-determination offers to groups who
invoke it. Worse than this, the first contradiction is that
international law explicitly supports groups in sovereign states in
their struggles for self-determination and permits states to do whatever
they feel is necessary to maintain their territorial integrity. Not only
does this mean that states like Turkey can oppress the desire of the
Kurds for their own state, but there are significant international
relations consequences as well. Effectively, the Israel-Palestine
debate, the Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh debate, and the
Russo-Ukrainian Donbas debate are all impossible for international law
to arbitrate on because international law supports both sides. Both the
state which rules as sovereign and the peoples invoking their right to
self-determination have legitimacy under the status quo, and
[international law has not made clear which right supersedes the other,
if one supersedes the others only at times, or if it is case-dependent.
[International law cannot be seriously considered as a legal framework
that deserves an enforcement mechanism until it can sort out its
foundational contradictions.]{.mark}]{.underline} So much better can be
done than what is set up right now, and a properly set out system for
international law would be hugely impactful. If international law were
to say that the right to self-determination can mean the right to
independence and that sometimes the right to self-determination could
supersede that of the right to sovereignty, how many people might
receive clear international legal support for their struggles? Making
better laws is the first step to making enforceable laws, and I look
forward to the day when I can say that international law is something
more than international grandstanding. One day, I would like to see
international law be that final, monumental stepping stone to freedom
and statehood.

### Solvency -- Marine Cloud Brightening 

#### Marine Cloud brightening is logistically feasible and would break the positive feedback loop of warming in the Arctic

Andrew **Anthony**, 11/27/**22**, The Guardian, "Melting point: could
'cloud brightening' slow the thawing of the Arctic?"

Like the apocryphal frog that doesn't notice the rising water
temperature until it's boiled alive, we as a global society are still
struggling to recognise that anthropic [global warming is hastening us
towards irreversible environmental and ecological
catastrophe.]{.underline} [While there is consensus among climate
scientists about the urgency of the situation]{.underline}, and
widespread political acknowledgment that the use of carbon fuels must be
reduced, [targets have not been met]{.underline} and as the UK's Cop26
president, Alok Sharma, said, [the lack of progress]{.underline} at this
month's Cop27 [demonstrates the 1.5C limit is on "life support" and
there is growing evidence that we are further along the road to a
tipping point than previously thought]{.underline}. So advanced is this
process that some [scientists are beginning to argue that merely cutting
carbon is not enough and an emergency measure involving what is known as
geoengineering is called for]{.underline}. There have been a number of
plans suggested, some more outlandish than others. They range from
building giant mirrors in space to reflect away sunlight to painting the
roofs of buildings white to help counteract heatwaves in cities.
[One]{.underline} particular [area of concern is the
Arctic]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, according to the latest
research by Norwegian scientists, [is warming at four times the speed of
the rest of the planet]{.underline}. [The more it warms, the more ice
cover it loses, which in turn leads to further heating, creating a
so-called positive feedback loop]{.underline} (although, paradoxically,
the effect is entirely negative). Two [suggestions for
geoengineering]{.underline} the poles' climate [have drawn serious
attention and have been the subject of theoretical
modelling]{.underline}. The most popular and perhaps advanced of these
is what is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, in which sulphur
dioxide would be released into the stratosphere to gather around the
poles. The idea is that the aerosols will have a similar effect to the
ash clouds from volcanoes, which reach a high altitude and reflect
sunlight, bringing down temperatures on Earth. There are many critics of
the proposal, who point out that sulphur dioxide, which is associated
with acid rain, asthma and chronic bronchitis, is itself environmentally
damaging and there is no guarantee that its effects would be limited to
the poles or, indeed, what its long-term effects might be. There has
been some very limited field work examining aerosol effects, but it has
been too restricted to offer any definitive answers. As Ben Kravitz,
atmospheric scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, says:
"It's difficult for me to say whether I'm for or against stratospheric
aerosol injection because it's hard for me to even understand what I'm
giving an opinion on. The effects will vary depending on how much
aerosol injection is done, where, when and what material is used. And
then we need to translate effects (such as changes in temperature,
precipitation, etc) into impacts (such as food and water security). And
then all of that needs to be compared to what would happen under climate
change without stratospheric aerosol injection. So it's too hard for me
to say whether geoengineering is a good or bad idea at this stage."
Aside from the inherent uncertainty in the proposal, there is also
concern about the politics of geoengineering, particularly in relation
to indigenous people in the Arctic region, with one group of scientists
arguing that "solar geoengineering at planetary scale is not governable
in a globally inclusive and just manner within the current international
political system". A recent study led by Wake Smith, a lecturer at Yale
University on venture capital and private equity, looked at the
financial and logistical implications of aerosol injection deployment.
The cost was estimated to be \$11bn a year -- no small sum, but a tiny
fraction of the costs of dealing with damage done by climate change. The
study suggested that 175,000 flights a year would be needed to release a
cloud of microscopic sulphur dioxide particles at an altitude of
43,000ft and latitude of 60 degrees in each hemisphere. Such a massive
air mobilisation would in turn release millions of tonnes of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere, but it would also lead, say the models, to
a 2C drop in temperature at the polar regions. Smith acknowledges that
it's a temporary measure that treats the symptoms rather than the
underlying disease. "It's aspirin, not penicillin," he's said. "It's not
a substitute for decarbonisation." In theory, the sulphur dioxide
particles would settle over the poles, but in practice, no one can be
sure. It's one of the reasons that cloud brightening has been suggested
as a less risky and more viable option. Sir David King is the founder of
[the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge]{.underline} (CCRC). A
multidisciplinary team, it has three main objectives: to reduce CO2
emissions, remove excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and to
refreeze damaged parts of the climate system. The CCRC [is backing
research into cloud brightening]{.underline}, which King insists is not
geoengineering. "We reserve the phrase geoengineering for putting
sulphates into the stratosphere," he explains. While he is in favour of
small-scale experiments with sulphates, he believes there should be a
moratorium on "at scale" use of them in the stratosphere. [Marine cloud
brightening]{.underline}, by contrast, he says [is]{.underline} not
geoengineering but "[biomimicry]{.underline}", a means of imitating a
natural process on a huge scale. [The science is straightforward in
theory]{.underline}. [Clouds formed over oceans tend to build around
salt crystals left after droplets of sea spray evaporate. Salt crystals
vary in size and if they are at the smaller end of the spectrum, then
clouds are formed of lots of small droplets. Clouds made from smaller
droplets appear whiter than those composed of larger droplets and as a
result reflect more sunlight,]{.underline} even if they carry the same
amount of water. [The idea is to whiten clouds by creating sea spray
with a flotilla of boats armed with pumps and nozzles]{.underline}.
"Once it's all been proved operative and functional and there's no
deleterious effects," says King, "[we would need to have 500 to 1,000
ocean-going vessels placed around the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}."

**[[This reduction produces significant warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
with concomitant enhanced melting, which has recently been quantified
\[20\]. For the period 1979--2011, warming due to reduced albedo in the
Arctic produced a forcing of 6.4 ± 0.9 W m−2, equivalent to an increase
in 0.21 ± 0.03 W m−2 averaged over the globe. Our MCB simulations
showing the extent of the Arctic Ice Fields in June July, August (JJA)
are presented in figure 2. JJA is chosen to represent average seasonal
changes, rather than the variable. September minimum, which as such, may
not be as representative of the slower climatic changes. In both the
Northern and Southern Hemisphere winters, the CC scenario causes ice to
retreat with respect to the CON. **[[The MCB simulations recover much of

upon the accuracy of sea-ice change values generated in HadGEM1. The
model does not generally produce significant changes in sea ice as a
result of small perturbations in radiative forcing. In the Northern
Hemisphere, the summer retreat in the CC simulation is 100 km greater
than for MCB -CC, but only 50 km greater than for the control. In the
Southern Hemisphere summer, the ice limit is not significantly different
between the control, MCB and CC simulations (results not shown in this
paper).

[[The Arctic is]{.mark} often referred to [a]{.mark}s the ["**canary in

change]{.underline}**]{.mark}, a metaphor that aptly encapsulates its
vulnerability and the broader implications of its decline. Over the past

warming**]{.underline}]{.mark}, nearly **[[three times the global
average]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a phenomenon known as Arctic
amplification. [[This]{.mark} rapid [warming has led to significant

[solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** to preserve Arctic sea ice. Among
**[[the most promising geoengineering strategie]{.mark}s [is Marine

that involves increasing the reflectivity of clouds over the ocean to

Science Behind Marine Cloud Brightening [[M]{.mark}arine [C]{.mark}loud
[B]{.mark}rightening [is grounded in well-established principles **of

intentional injection of aerosols]{.underline}]{.mark}, typically sea
salt particles, [[into the atmosphere to]{.underline} **[enhance cloud
reflectivity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. These aerosols serve as cloud
condensation nuclei, around which water vapour condenses to form clouds.
By increasing the number of these nuclei, [[MCB can create **clouds that
are denser and more reflective**]{.underline}]{.mark}, thereby
reflecting more sunlight back into space and reducing the amount of
solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface[. [MCB is particularly
**well-suited to the Arctic context**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The region's
unique meteorological conditions, characterised by low solar angles and
extensive cloud cover, mean that [even **[small changes in cloud
properties can have significant cooling effects]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[[Furthermore, the technique is]{.mark} inherently [scalable and **can
be targeted to specific regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, making it a
versatile tool in the fight against climate change.

#### Marine cloud brightening is comparatively best method of solar geoengineering 

Oren **Gruenbaum**, 6/25/**25**, The Guardian, "Mirrors in space and
underwater curtains: can technology buy us enough time to save the
Arctic ice caps?",

mm

When the glaciologist John Moore began studying the Arctic in the 1980s
there was an abundance of suitable sites for him to carry out his
climate research. The region's relentless warming means many of those no
longer exist. With the Arctic heating up four times faster than the
global average, they have simply melted away. Forty years on, Moore's
research network, [[the University of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark},
[has [identified]{.mark} [61 potential interventions to slow, stop and
reverse the effects of the changing climate in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. These concepts are constantly being updated
and some will be assessed at a conference in Cambridge this week, where
scientists and engineers will meet to consider if radical, technological
solutions can buy time and stem the loss of polar ice caps. "We want to
get them down to maybe 10 \[ideas\] that it's possible to proceed with.
No one is talking about deployment yet," Moore says, insisting that
research is about "excluding the non-starters, the hopeless ideas". "But
we may have ideas that work if we start them now; if we don't do
something for 30 years, it could be too late." The best way to do that,
he says, "is by evaluating them in a rational manner; otherwise it's
just guesswork or religion". From [[sunlight reflection
methods]{.underline}]{.mark} (SRM) by brightening Arctic clouds,
stabilising ice sheets with huge underwater curtains to stop warm water
melting glaciers, and even building vast mirrors in space, ideas that
were once closer to science fiction [[have become increasingly
mainstream]{.underline}]{.mark}. "None of these ideas are going to fix
everything," says Moore, adding that part of the issue will be to weigh
up the potential cost against the perceived benefit. For Dr Shaun
Fitzgerald, director of Cambridge University's centre for climate
repair, which is hosting the conference, it has been a 30-year journey
-- from working in emissions reduction to exploring more radical ideas
to save the Arctic -- as he became aware of "our futile progress" in
slowing the climate crisis. "I felt an obligation to further our
knowledge in these other areas," he says. Some of the more outlandish
sounding ideas to be debated include the use of 10km-wide sunshades
suspended between Zeppelin-sized airships and creating corridors of
anchored rafts to help Arctic wildlife that require ice floes. Other
measures are already under way. Last year, British startup Real Ice and
Dutch company Arctic Reflections undertook projects that pumped water on
to the ice to refreeze it. For many critics, the ethical and legal
questions around many of these interventions make geoengineering a
fraught subject. In 2021, for example, the Saami Council, which
represents the interests of the Saami people across Finland, Norway,
Sweden and Russia, joined NGOs in criticising the proposed pilot of a
Harvard-led project that wanted to test plans for stratospheric aerosol
injection (SAI). This method involves introducing aerosols into the
stratosphere to reflect sunlight and cool the planet by mimicking the
effect of a large volcanic eruption. The plan was, the Saami Council
wrote, a "real moral hazard". With sensitivities such as these in mind,
the Cambridge conference also features contributions on ethics,
governance, sustainability and public engagement. [[Among the
interventions]{.underline}]{.mark} identified by Moore [to slow, stop
and reverse the effects of the climate emergency in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [[some have been significantly researched
already]{.underline}]{.mark}. But many ideas have barely made it off the
drawing board, require enormous funds or have little chance of being
done at sufficient scale. The conclusions, so far, are that ocean-based
concepts come with far more uncertainty, limitations and risks, while a
few scored so low against most criteria that the study declares them to
be "unsuitable for further consideration". One of these -- modifying
ocean currents -- was first mooted during the cold war, when blocking
off the Bering strait was suggested to make the Arctic more habitable.
Years later, the climate activist Rolf Schuttenhelm made a similar
suggestion but with the aim of increasing Arctic sea ice. "It's very
easy to go wrong, and no one knows the right path," Moore says. "You
proceed all the time with local benefits, and in the end, hope there can
be global benefits." Fitzgerald would not be drawn on which concepts he
considers frontrunners, and says: "It's really important that we
maintain an open mind on different approaches." However, [[much of the
attention is on]{.underline}]{.mark} SAI and [[marine-cloud
brightening]{.underline}]{.mark} (MCB). Prof Peter Wadhams, head of
Cambridge University's Polar Ocean Physics Group, calls MCB [[a "very
potent" method]{.underline}]{.mark}. ["It has the significant advantage
that [you can turn off the process if it appears to have a harmful
effect]{.mark}, as it is implemented on a smaller scale]{.underline},"
he says. He is less enthusiastic about SAI, believing that it would be a
dangerously long-lived intervention compared with MCB. Thickening sea
ice, on the other hand, is impractical, he says, because of the huge
amount of energy required. "It may work on a small scale," he says. "But
not on a scale that would make a difference. [[Marine-cloud brightening
remains **the best bet and the most carefully
thought-out**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

### Solvency -- Sea Ice Restoration

#### Marine cloud brightening will break the positive feedback loop in the Arctic and yield significant sea ice restoration

**Parkes** B, Gadian A, **and Latham** J (**2012**) The effects of
marine cloud brightening on seasonal polar temperatures and the
meridional heat flux. ISRN Geophysics 2012:1--7.
https://doi.org/10.5402/2012/142872

[The results from our]{.underline} four [climate
simulations]{.underline} including two MCB \[Marine Cloud Brightening\]
scenarios [show a strong connection between sea ice fraction and sea
surface temperatures]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} two [quantities
are influenced by a sea ice-albedo feedback loop]{.underline} which in
turn is influenced by the MHF \[meridional heat flux\], which transports
heat energy polewards \[21\]. Furthermore our control simulation (CON)
is in good agreement with previous work on the MHF using the ERBE
dataset \[10, 20\]. [Polar amplification leads to a polar heating and
thus a reduction in sea ice which then possibly starts the positive
feedback resulting in further heating and sea ice loss]{.underline}.
Thus [MCB]{.underline} [may be able to target polar regions more
effectively than other geoengineering methods]{.underline} \[5, 11\]. In
particular, in the double carbon dioxide scenario, MCB produces a
significant reduction in sea ice loss. We can see from the results in
Figures 2(c), 2(d), 3(c), and 3(d) that [seeding]{.underline} the
selected three regions of [stratocumulus clouds returns
climate]{.underline} to [close to]{.underline} but not exactly [the
control situation]{.underline}. This agrees with results \[5\] where
different areas of cloud were seeded to a much higher value of N. The
ability of MCB to return to close to a control simulation is further
reflected in Figure 4 where the MCB3 MHF flux curve is almost overlaid
on CON. The results from a double carbon dioxide atmosphere (no seeding)
run are consistent with those of \[4--7\]. These show that polar regions
are warmed significantly more than tropical regions and that this
warming has a significant impact upon sea ice cover.  When an MCBA
seeding scenario is used we see further evidence to support the link
between MHF and polar temperatures and also the impact these
temperatures have on sea ice fraction. [With reduced polar
temperatures]{.underline}, **[ice growth is significant]{.underline}**.
[This work builds upon previous studies]{.underline} \[4--7, 11\] [which
show that MCB]{.underline} cannot reproduce the control climate but [can
return the polar ice state to that similar to the control]{.underline}.
There is a need for further studies to understand better the
complexities of marine stratocumulus clouds, to assess the consequences
of modifying the patterns of polar temperature and sea ice cover, and to
thoroughly examine the (possibly adverse) consequences of MCB
deployment. The impact of MCB on precipitation patters has been
investigated in several publications \[4--7, 13\]. Work in Latham et al.
(In press) \[13\] uses simulations similar to those in Table 1 to assess
the impact of three region MCB on precipitation patterns.

#### Ice restoration will preserve the Arctic albedo effect -- that reverses ice melt and slows warming

Steven **Desch et al.,** 12/19/**16**, \[School of Earth and Space
Exploration, Arizona State University\], Earth's Future, 5(1), "Arctic
ice management,"
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000410, mm

[With a model]{.underline} in hand to calculate the thickness of ice
over the course of an Arctic winter and summer, [we can estimate how
well adding 1 m of ice to the Arctic can counteract existing
trends]{.underline}. It is noteworthy that half of the Arctic sea ice
currently has a mean annual thickness of only 1.5 m (Figure 3). [Adding
1 m of ice in the course of one winter is a significant
change]{.underline}. Also evident from Figure 3 is the fact that the
mean annual thickness of ice decreased by 0.58 m per decade over the
years 2000--2012 \[Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015\]. [Adding 1 m of ice to
the average thickness of the Arctic is equivalent to **instantaneously
setting back the clock about 17 years**]{.underline}.
[Implementation]{.underline} over the entire Arctic in the early 2030s,
in 1 year adding 1 m of ice, [would reset the clock to the present day,
instead of the largely ice-free summer state one expects by the
2030s]{.underline}. But in fact, [the effects are likely to be
cumulative]{.underline}. Artificial pumping could add an additional 1 m
of ice every winter. In this sense, implementing artificial pumping in
10% of the Arctic Ocean could have the effect of offsetting 1 m per
decade decline in mean annual sea-ice thickness, more than enough to
counteract current trends. Another way to judge the efficacy of
increasing ice thickness is to assess how much longer ice extent would
survive in the summer. Currently, we expect ice of thickness 2.7 m to
survive the summer at the location of the Beaufort Sea buoy, melting
only 1.5 m; but if the ice started the summer thinner than 1.5 m, it
would melt before the end of the summer. Using our melting model
described above, we calculate that sea ice would survive the summer if
it started at 1.5 m or thicker, would melt on 15 September if it started
at 1.4 m, 18 August if it started at 1.2 m, and 4 August if it started
at 1.0 m. From these calculations we estimate that each 0.2 m of ice
thickness would delay the melting of the sea ice by approximately 3
weeks, depending on the exact initial thickness. Very similar results
obtain at different latitudes. As seen in Figure 1, survival of the ice
through the Arctic summer is marginal in over half of the Arctic Ocean;
in those regions, artificial pumping over the Arctic winter to increase
ice thickness by 1 m translates into several months of extra ice extent,
potentially enough to last the summer. We note that [if the ice were to
survive the entire summer, instead of there being no ice over the entire
summer, the albedo difference]{.underline} (0.3 versus 0.06) would be
sufficient to reflect back 2.3 × 108 J m−2 of sunlight over the course
of the summer. Assuming the loss of albedo takes place over the entire
107 km2 of the Arctic Ocean, this [would represent a direct global,
yearly averaged radiative forcing]{.underline} of 0.14 W m−2,
[which]{.underline} by itself **[is a significant portion of the global
anthropogenic radiative forcing]{.underline}**, approximately 1 W m−2.
Alternatively, we can consider the effect of increased air temperatures.
We assume that insolation would not be quite sufficient to melt the ice,
but that the extra heating from the warmer air would cause the ice to
melt. In that case, addition of 1 m of ice therefore counteracts a
melting rate of 0.77 cm per TDD, extending the duration of the ice by
about 130 TDDs. Given that locations in the Arctic Ocean typically
experience 0 to −200 TDDs (Figure 7), an extra 130 TDDs to melt the sea
ice is significant. Since ice melts over the 4 months of
June--September, 130 TDDs is equivalent to an increase of about 1.0°C.
It is noteworthy that temperatures in the Arctic in summer 2007, which
had exceptionally low sea ice extent, were about 0.5°C warmer than the
1971--2000 average \[Kumar et al., 2010\]. [Artificially enhancing the
thickness of Arctic sea ice can significantly offset the melting of ice
by warmer air temperatures]{.underline}. Moving forward, analysis is
needed to identify where the multiyear ice is decreasing in thickness or
where the net TDDs are increasing. Our analysis so far shows that
artificial thickening of the ice can counteract a roughly 1°C
temperature increase across the Arctic. Or, for ice that is marginally
able to survive the summer, artificial thickening of ice keeps the ice
frozen throughout the summer when it might otherwise melt. Addition of 1
m of ice each winter throughout 10% of the Arctic Ocean would offset the
current decrease in ice thickness observed since 2000. The potential
effects are significant, and it is worth examining how they might be
implemented.

### AT Solar Geoengineering Bad -- Climate Risks O/W

#### Any risks of solar geoengineering are outweighed by climate change -- accelerated warming makes the Earth uninhabitable

As a climate scientist working on solar geoengineering, I was struck by
Raymond Pierrehumbert and Michael Mann's call to defund the UK's
Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) research programme (The
UK's gamble on solar geoengineering is like using aspirin for cancer, 12
March). [Given current emission projections, it is likely that the world
will reach 2C of warming]{.underline}. [The only potential tool we have

geoengineering]{.underline}. It is necessary to reduce emissions, but
once we reach net zero, global temperatures only stabilise, and the
melting of glaciers and sea level rise will continue. While it is
possible to remove carbon from the atmosphere, it remains slow and
expensive for now. Solar geoengineering research is important because it
is possible that the climate will react more strongly to greenhouse
gases than expected, and even 2C of warming might have devastating
impacts. [It is undeniable that solar geoengineering]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} physical and political [risks]{.underline}, and I
share many of the concerns the authors raise. [However, a warmer world
that would]{.underline} increasingly **[become
uninhabitable]{.underline}** is also risky. [Hence the risks of solar
geoengineering must be balanced with the risks from]{.underline} the
[warming]{.underline} that would be attenuated. [Climate model evidence
suggests that some important hazards linked to climate change could be
limited with a judicious deployment of solar
geoengineering.]{.underline} However, climate models contain many
uncertainties that well‑governed, small-scale outdoor experiments may
enable us to reduce. While more research and higher‑quality information
on solar geoengineering are not sufficient to guarantee good
decision-making about it in the future, they are certainly a
prerequisite. I welcome the UK government's investment in solar
geoengineering research.

### AT Solar Geoengineering Bad -- AT "Termination Shock"

#### No threat from termination shock -- buffer time ensures systems could be restarted before warming trends resume 

Andy **Parker** **and** Peter **Irvine**, March **2018**, \[Parker works

Germany; Irvine works at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and
Applied Sciences, Harvard University\], Earth's Future, 6(3), "The Risk
of Termination Shock from Solar Geoengineering",

[It has been suggested that destruction of the SRM deployment
infrastructure]{.underline}, for instance by terrorist attack, [could
cause termination shock]{.underline} (Bellamy & Lezaun, 2017; Olson,
2011; Pierrehumbert, 2015). By plotting out the pathway, it becomes
clear that [a number of conditions would have to be met for destruction
of infrastructure to lead to termination shock]{.underline} (see Figure
1). First, [an attack must overcome any defensive systems and disable a
large fraction of the deployment capability]{.underline}. Achieving more
than 1 W m−2 of cooling through stratospheric aerosol injection would
require fleets of hundreds of aircrafts, most likely operating out of
numerous air fields around the world, so a physical attack would have to
be extremely well planned, coordinated, and supported to be effective. A
cyberattack might conceivably be able to disable an entire system at
once, however. Second, [even if defenses failed, a termination shock
would still not be automatic]{.underline}. [There would still be a
buffer period of months]{.underline} (at least) [during which the system
could be repaired or a backup system deployed before the global
temperature rise became significant]{.underline}. If no replacement SRM
system were deployed during this time, termination shock would occur. It
should be relatively simple to greatly increase the robustness of an SRM
system against destruction of deployment infrastructure. Basic defenses
of the delivery equipment, such as those that guard nuclear power plants
or military bases, are an obvious precaution. Also, the more
geographically distributed the aerosol delivery system, the harder it
would be to disable a large fraction of it. Even if a terrorist attack
were successful in stopping SRM globally, [relatively easy and cheap
policy choices would allow operations to restart soon after
disruption.]{.underline} If any capable party, anywhere around the
world, kept backup SRM delivery hardware, it could be redeployed to
maintain the SRM cooling before temperatures started to rise rapidly.

### AT Solar Geoengineering Bad -- AT "Termination Shock: DA Turns Case"

#### The DA wouldn't turn case -- geoengineering capabilities would remain resilient even during a major catastrophe 

Andy **Parker** **and** Peter **Irvine**, March **2018**, \[Parker works
at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam,
Germany; Irvine works at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and
Applied Sciences, Harvard University\], Earth's Future, 6(3), "The Risk
of Termination Shock from Solar Geoengineering",
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017EF000735,
mm

Beyond the destruction of the SRM deployment infrastructure,
[termination could be forced if a large catastrophe]{.underline} (such
as a natural disaster, an economic collapse, or a war) [were to
interrupt the economic or political ability to maintain an SRM
program]{.underline}. Figure 2 outlines this pathway. First, the
deployer(s) would have to suffer an event that destroyed their economic
and/or political capacity to maintain SRM. Second, there would need to
be no other actors capable of redeploying before temperatures rose
rapidly. If neither the original deployer nor any other party were
capable of redeploying an SRM system in the months after a catastrophe,
then termination shock would occur. The same measures that would
increase the resilience of SRM against terrorist attacks would also
increase resilience against disasters that were local or regional in
scope. If spare deployment capacity were maintained or numerous nations
were capable of deployment, then the SRM system would be resilient
against catastrophes that were confined to one country or one region.
Not all catastrophes are regional though, and various [global
calamities]{.underline} (such as nuclear war, a global pandemic, or an
economic collapse) [have been suggested as possible drivers of
termination]{.underline} (Barrett, 2014; Hamilton, 2013; Olson, 2011).
Amidst a true global catastrophe, one that destroyed the capacity of all
competent actors to maintain deployment, backup delivery equipment would
not help. While there should be no doubt that a global catastrophe could
destroy global capacity to maintain SRM, [it is worth
noting]{.underline} quite [how destructive such an event would have to
be.]{.underline} For example, [consider how large the economic damage
would have to be before maintaining SRM became
unaffordable.]{.underline} If nations were to cooperate to maintain
SRM---a proposition that we find reasonable given the projected damages
of termination shock---then [global gross domestic product]{.underline}
(GDP) [would]{.underline} still [need to drop by over 90%]{.underline}
before maintaining SRM would cost more than 1% of the collective
postcatastrophe GDP of the world\'s top 20 economies. 1 [Even assuming
no international cooperation, the catastrophe would still have to be
colossal to force SRM termination based on economic
factors]{.underline}. [Even if a disaster wiped off 70% of their
GDPs]{.underline}, China or [the United States alone could still deploy
SRM for less than 1% of their postcatastrophe GDPs]{.underline} (IMF,
2014). [To put these figures in context, arguably the greatest
international calamities of the last century, World War I and Spanish
influenza combined, the Great Depression, and World War II caused GDP in
Europe to fall by 13%, 8%, and 21%, respectively]{.underline} (The
Maddison-Project, 2013). Therefore, if spare deployment capacity were
maintained, or could be brought online quickly, [a catastrophe would
have to be on a scale unprecedented in modern history to force
termination shock]{.underline}. Such events are not inconceivable
though, and an asteroid strike, global nuclear war, or catastrophic
pandemic could force an end to SRM even where there was a desire to
maintain it. In this instance, few policies could prevent termination.
We reflect on this possibility in Section 4.3.

### AT Solar Geoengineering Bad -- AT Counter Geoengineering

#### Counter-geoengineering is diplomatically and technically infeasible 

Adam **Lockyer** **and** Jonathan **Symons**, **2019**, Australian
Journal of International Affairs, "The national security implications of
solar geoengineering: an Australian perspective,"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357718.2019.1662768, mm

[The possibility that opponents of solar geoengineering might conduct
'counter-geoengineering' to negate the impact of a contested
geoengineering]{.underline} effort has been canvassed elsewhere (Heyen,
Horton, and Moreno-Cruz 2019). Counter-geoengineering might involve
either stratospheric interventions that accelerate the coagulation of
reflective aerosols and thus hasten their removal from the stratosphere,
or the deliberate release of greenhouse gases (Heyen, Horton, and
Moreno-Cruz 2019, 154). We argue that such countergeoengineering [is
improbable]{.underline}. [Stratospheric interventions to accelerate
coagulation would be considerably more technologically complex than
solar geoengineering itself]{.underline}. [Meanwhile, a state that
deliberately intervened to warm the planet would likely be judged both
domestically and internationally]{.underline}. Consequently, we believe
geoengineering's opponents would be more likely to utilise traditional
economic or diplomatic sanctions. Failing that, opposing states might
seek to neutralise geoengineering potential by destroying airbases and
planes with kinetic or cyberattacks. In this case, the key security risk
would be military escalation.

### AT Solar Geoengineering Bad -- AT Weaponization Turn

#### Solar geoengineering can't be weaponized -- especially true for marine cloud brightening

**Council on Foreign Relations**, 4/29/**21**, "Can Solar Geoengineering
be used as a weapon?"
https://www.cfr.org/blog/can-solar-geoengineering-be-used-weapon, mm

[The premise that solar geoengineering is weaponizable]{.underline},
however, [is either false or grossly overstated and inapplicable to
those technologies that might plausibly be deployed]{.underline}.
Precision is a defining attribute of weaponry; indeed, the so-called
revolution in military affairs has made it the most prized attribute for
many strategists, as exemplified by the dominant role now played by
precision-guided munitions. One hallmark of solar geoengineering,
however, would be its imprecision. Take stratospheric aerosol injection
(SAI), which would disperse aerosols in the stratosphere to reflect
sunlight and reduce some harmful aspects of climate change. SAI is the
most prominent type of solar geoengineering and the one most associated
with fears about weaponization. Yet injected materials cannot be
contained along lines of latitude and would quickly encircle the globe.
Some north-south control is possible, but only at a very crude level
using just a few knobs like dispersing in equatorial versus polar
regions or in northern versus southern hemispheres. Only climate
effects---changes in average temperature and precipitation---could
plausibly be induced; weather control at the level of individual storms
or heat waves would be impossible to engineer. Moreover, there would be
several steps between any induced climate change and the types of
climate impacts---like changes in water availability or crop
yields---that might affect states and societies in a somewhat
predictable manner. There is simply no physical basis for believing that
significant---large compared to natural variability---impacts could be
targeted at the level of the nation-state. Thus, SAI would be much too
imprecise to function as a useful weapon. To take just one scenario,
suppose the United States wished to attack Venezuela. The most
predictable damage the United States could inflict using SAI would be a
reduction in precipitation caused by dispersing aerosols solely in the
southern hemisphere; doing so would shift the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ), an equatorial band of tropical rainfall northward, leading
to decreased rainfall over Caribbean South America. But since the ITCZ
circles the globe, this action would disrupt (sub)tropical precipitation
worldwide. Indiscriminate climate modification of this nature would
surely not be welcomed by China (America's principal rival), India (the
linchpin of America's Indo-Pacific strategy), or Mexico (America's
southern neighbor and third largest trading partner). Furthermore, the
effect would be slow-moving within Venezuela, requiring perhaps years to
determine whether reduced rainfall was responsible for observed impacts
like droughts or food shortages. And it would be even harder to link
this intervention to combat readiness, battlefield conditions, and other
operational variables with clear implications for warfighting. Whatever
strategic or tactical benefits might accrue to the United States, they
would be dwarfed by the costs, risks, and uncertainties produced by
worldwide rainfall disruptions affecting friends and enemies alike. SAI
lacks the minimum level of precision---in space, time, and
effect---implicit in the concept of a weapon. The other two solar
geoengineering technologies regularly discussed---low-level [marine
cloud brightening]{.underline} (MCB) using seawater spray to block
incoming sunlight, and high-altitude cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) via
dissipative seeding to enable more outgoing heat to escape the
atmosphere---could be deployed with far more precision in space and
time, yet it [would]{.underline} still [be extraordinarily difficult to
use]{.underline} them [to produce strong local effects]{.underline}, and
such effects would inevitably cause significant distant consequences. It
is conceivable that if MCB or CCT were deployed at global scale then
they could be fine-tuned using meteorological data to enable limited
weather control. But this is unproven, and even if possible, [the
physical consequences might be too diffuse or easily countered to have
significant military value.]{.underline} This is not to say that
weaponization is utterly impossible. If solar geoengineering was
implemented using low-Earth orbiting sunshades adjustable in real time,
then some more precise military applications are imaginable. Yet this
form of solar geoengineering is so far from practical reality as to be
science fiction. Weaponization might therefore be at least theoretically
possible in a few exceptional cases, but in terms of real world policy
relevance, the [kinds of solar geoengineering that might plausibly be
deployed]{.underline} in the next half-century---including
SAI---**[would simply not be weaponizable]{.underline}**. This
conclusion does not depend on any assumption of goodwill, but instead
follows directly from an understanding of the physical limits of
practical technologies. For this reason, serious assessments of solar
geoengineering---like the recently released National Academies of
Sciences report---ignore the issue altogether.

## AT Decarbonization DA

(Strategy Note -- link-turning the DA is the best option: "The
decarbonization push isn't happening fast enough now, but SRM buys more
time to allow the uptake of clean tech." Important -- for the UQ debate,
you do not want to argue that decarbonation never happens since that
means GHG increases will eventually outpace the ability of SRM to offset
said emissions. You want to argue that decarbonization can happen, just
not fast enough to prevent Arctic ice melt and rapid warming)

election (whose outcome admittedly will to a large extent determine the
fate of our climate). The report [identifies a "massive gap between
rhetoric and reality]{.underline}" [as countries draft their new climate
commitments]{.underline}, to be presented early in 2025, while climate
impacts intensify around the globe. "[Nations must deliver dramatically
stronger ambition and action]{.underline} in the next round of

only be limited to]{.underline} 2.6-[2.8°C.]{.underline} Nations must
collectively commit to cutting 42 per cent off annual greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030 and 57 percent by 2025 in the next round of Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs) -- and back this up with rapid action.
Otherwise, the world on course for a temperature increase of 2.6-3.1°C
over the course of this century. This would bring "debilitating impacts
to people, planet and economies", UNEP states. That could be putting it
mildly.

#### Current green energy transitioning fails

**Doumon, 24** --- Assistant Professor and Virginia S. & Philip L.
Walker Jr. Faculty Fellow, Materials Science and Engineering (June 11,
2024, PennState, "Transitioning to renewable energy: Challenges and
opportunities,"

AC

[[The energy transition]{.underline}]{.mark} is not a simple task. It
[[faces many **multifaceted challenges**, including technological,
environmental, societal, economic, and geopolitical
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, I will comment briefly on the
technological and geopolitical aspects to give you a sense of the
complexity we are dealing with.

From a geopolitical perspective, it is [crucial to acknowledge the
concerns of [many regions or countries]{.mark} in the global south. They
[believe the West is **coercing** them]{.mark}]{.underline} into
adopting renewable technologies, arguing that they have not been the
main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and that transitioning to
other energy sources is not a priority, especially when they have not
yet reached the level of development that the West has experienced.
[They believe,]{.underline} especially in Africa, [that [this may
stall]{.mark} Africa's rise out of **poverty**]{.underline}. These
opinions are thoroughly expressed in two op-eds authored separately by
the ex-vice-president of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo in an Economist
op-ed (paywall), and the president of Uganda, his excellency Yoweri K.
Museveni, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (paywall). This could be a
whole debate on its own.

From a technological perspective, the energy transition seems to be
equated with [transitioning entirely from fossil fuels to renewable
energy sources through **novel technologies**]{.underline}. While this
is an ideal scenario for the betterment of the planet, the reality
[could involve drastically reducing fossil fuels and significantly
increasing renewable fuels]{.underline}. [[Most renewable energy
technologies are **not fully mature**]{.underline}]{.mark} and do not
yet match fossil fuels in terms of societal integration. Silicon-based
solar technology, the most established, has an efficiency of 26% and a
lifespan of 20-25 years. Many other solar technologies, such as organic,
dye-sensitized, and perovskite solar cells, are still under
investigation and not yet market-ready due to their low efficiency and
instability.

The biggest challenge to [[solar technolog]{.underline}y]{.mark} is that
it [[**cannot be a standalone** solution;]{.mark} it needs complementary
storage technologies like batteries to be fully accessible]{.underline}
24/7. [Solar installations]{.underline} also [require significant
land]{.underline}, often in farming communities. [[Mining for
material]{.mark}s]{.underline} to sustain solar and battery technologies
[[opens a new set of challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There are many
ramifications in terms of challenge]{.underline}s that solar power or
panels face during their lifespan, [[including disposal or
recycling]{.underline}]{.mark} of this technology.

#### The current renewable energy transition fails.

David **Wallace-Wells** April 30, 20**25** (American journalist known
for his writings on climate change; wrote the 2017 essay \"The
Uninhabitable Earth\" most-read article in the history of the magazine.
"Climate Change Urgency Has Declined. The Green Transition Hasn't."

"**[[After]{.underline}]{.mark}** two **[[centuries
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[['energy
transitions]{.underline}]{.mark}**,' **[[humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
has [never burned so much oil and gas, so much coa]{.underline}l and so
much wood," Fressoz writes. Yes, that's right: It's not just that we
**[[haven't moved on from oi]{.underline}]{.mark}**l, we haven't even
moved on from trees. "Today, around [two billion cubic meters of wood
are felled each year to be burned]{.underline}, three times more than a
century ago."

We may talk about the age of oil or the age of steam, but in almost all
cases, Fressoz writes, **[[the energy systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**
supplemented **[[rather than supplanting one
another]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the equivalent, in past centuries, of
today's electrified L.N.G. terminals, **[[run]{.underline}]{.mark}**ning
**[[on renewable power]{.underline}]{.mark}** but **[[spewing fossil
fuel]{.underline}]{.mark}**s out into the rest of the world, where they
will be burned.

You may think of coal as 19th-century energy, if you're thinking of a
British Empire built by bricks of carbon, or perhaps you think of it as
a 20th-century power source, if you're thinking about Pennsylvania
miners and an American Rust Belt juggernaut. But worldwide, the period
of greatest growth in coal power was between 1980 and 2010, when [global
use grew by 300 percen]{.underline}t --- [increasing 10-fold in China
and the Philippine]{.underline}s, and just over that much in Taiwan and
Vietnam (and roughly [50-fold in Indonesia]{.underline}). In the same
period, it [doubled in the United States]{.underline} and Japan: As
Fressoz points out, [President George W. Bush's America consumed four
times as much coal as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's.]{.underline}

These are the transitions often invoked as models for the one we are
embarking on now, but "[faced with the climate crisis, we can no longer
be satisfied with a history written in relative terms,"]{.underline}
Fressoz writes. "A **[['transition']{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[toward
renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [**[would see fossil
fuels]{.mark}** diminish in relative terms]{.underline} but
**[[stagnate]{.underline}]{.mark}** in terms of tons would **[[solve
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Instead of a transition, he suggests,
we need an energy "amputation": "to get rid, in four decades, of the
proportion of the world's energy --- more than three-quarters ---
derived from fossil fuels. To think that we can draw some useful
analogies from history dramatically underestimates the novelty and scale
of the climate challenge."

said. "This is hardly the future picture some have been painting,"
Nasser said. "Even they are starting to acknowledge the importance of

meanwhile, will drive [[oil and gas **demand**]{.mark} as prosperity
[**rises** in]{.mark} those [nations]{.mark}, which represent **[more

nations receive **[less than 5% of the investment targeting renewable

more** [on]{.mark} [**reducing emissions** from oil and gas]{.mark} **in

solar, meanwhile, have substituted only 15 million barrels over the same
period, he said. "We should phase in new energy sources and technologies
when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive and with the
right infrastructure," Nasser said.

[significantly]{.underline} [decelerate]{.underline} [the race to
decarbonize economies around the world]{.underline}, according to energy
and climate change experts. Since taking office in January, [Trump has
signed several executive orders aiming to dismantle climate
action]{.underline} in the U.S. While these actions have spurred
uncertainty in the environmental community, they won\'t cause global
efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to come to a
screeching halt, the experts said. This is how these policies will
affect America\'s international standing in the climate fight and the
collective aim to reach a carbon net-zero economy, according to the
experts: In the four months since [Trump]{.underline} took office for
his second term, he has [declared an energy crisis]{.underline} in the
U.S.; [removed the U.S. from the Paris Agreement]{.underline} for the
second time; [increased timber production]{.underline} in national
forests [and expanded the mining and use of coal]{.underline} in the
U.S. Trump\'s administration has rolled back dozens of U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency regulations aimed at protecting the
environment; laid off hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and removed mentions of climate change from
public websites. Last week, Trump issued executive orders to protect
\"American energy from state overreach.\" These orders contain language
that could block enforcement of state and local laws that are obstacles
to production or use of coal, oil, natural gas, hydropower, geothermal,
biofuel and nuclear energy and potentially withdraw regulations that
affect energy projects and the environment. The Department of the
Interior also announced a new offshore leasing plan on the U.S. Outer
Continental Shelf last week. \"It\'s past time to phase out offshore
drilling and oil spills, not make way for more,\" Rachel Mathews, a
senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a
statement to ABC News. \"It\'s clear that oil and gas doesn\'t mix with
a clean and safe ocean environment.\" [The \"Climate
Backtracker]{.underline},\" a database by Columbia University\'s Sabin
Center for Climate Change that tracks steps taken by the Trump
administration to scale back or eliminate federal climate mitigation and
adaption measures, [lists nearly 100 actions taken]{.underline} since
Jan. 9. Trump\'s actions are largely shrouded in the idea of lessening
American dependence on the rest of the world. \"We have the largest
amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are going to use
it,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech in January. \"We will
bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top
and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation
again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do
it.\" But [these]{.underline} [executive orders could significantly slow
down global progress on reaching their net-zero goals]{.underline} \--
[something individual countries are already struggling
with,]{.underline} experts told ABC News. Countries around the globe,
including some of the biggest emitters, have made ambitious goals to
decarbonize their economies in the coming decades. China is aiming to
get its economy to net-zero, or a carbon neutral impact, by 2060. India
has pledged to reach net-zero by 2070. Brazil, the host of the 30th
Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate
Change, or COP30, has promised to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 \-- as
has the U.S., under the Biden administration. While [no one country is
on track to meet those goals]{.underline}, [the momentum in the climate
fight]{.underline} seen in recent years, spurred domestically by the
Biden administration, **[has now been reversed,]{.underline}** Frances
Colon, senior fellow of international climate at the Center for American
Progress, told ABC News. But as the top historical emitter of greenhouse
gases, the U.S. should be among the countries setting an example for the
rest of the world to decarbonize while helping smaller, poorer countries
achieve net-zero goals as well, according to the United Nations. The
U.S. is responsible for 20% of the carbon dioxide emissions released
since 1850, according to Carbon Brief, a climate science database. The
next-highest historical emitters are China at 11%; Russia at 7%; Brazil
at 5% and Indonesia at 4%. Europe has been the global leader of
transitioning its energy sectors to renewables, while China has been the
leader of clean tech, Noah Kaufman, a senior researcher at Columbia
University\'s Center on Global Energy Policy, told ABC News. [The lost
momentum will send the U.S. lagging even further behind,]{.underline}
which will result in missed opportunities for Americans to save on their
energy bills and for American-based firms to profit from the development
of clean tech, David Victor, a professor of innovation and public policy
at the University of California San Diego, told ABC News. [Trump\'s
policies]{.underline}, especially the ones targeting renewable energy,
[may be the GOP\'s last hurrah to bring fossil fuels back]{.underline}
to the forefront, Michael Lenox, a professor at the University of
Virginia\'s Darden School of Business, told ABC News.
[Eventually]{.underline}, [major technological shifts]{.underline} in a
number of core industries [will cause markets to]{.underline} take over
and [force economies to adopt clean energy]{.underline}, according to
Lenox. \"I don\'t think the momentum has stopped,\" Victor said. \"I
think the federal policy is in chaos right now.\" The transition from
internal combustion engines to electric vehicles is already happening on
a large scale in several countries. In Norway, nearly 90% of new car
sales are EVs. More than 50% of new car sales in China are EVs. Once the
cost of EVs begins to drop lower than internal combustion vehicles, the
U.S., which has been lagging behind the rest of the world in EV sales,
will likely start to catch up, Lenox said. [The adoption of renewable
energy]{.underline} for a host of sectors that are harder to
decarbonize, like the production of steel and cement, [will eventually
lead to the end of utilization of fossil fuels]{.underline} to power
those supply chains as well, Lenox said. \"Clean energy investments are
outpacing fossil fuel investments two-to-one globally,\" Colon said.
China is among the countries leading the technologies that are going to
allow for decarbonization, the experts said. \"They have made huge
investments in battery technology, EVs, solar and wind, and basically
own the supply chain of especially the kind of upstream part of things
like batteries,\" Lenox said. While the Trump administration may be
trying to bring coal, gas and oil back to the forefront of energy
sources, it\'s not likely to happen, the experts said. Increasing
production and flooding the market with excess supply will cause prices
to go down \-- something the fossil fuel industry wants to avoid. \"The
reality is, a lot of this stuff makes sense commercially, and that
continues forward,\" Victor said.

I[n **[2024 global production of wind and solar energy reached record
levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}---levels that would have seemed
unthinkable not long before. Over the past 15 years, wind and solar have
grown from virtually zero to 15 percent of the world's electricity
generation, and solar panel prices have fallen by as much as 90 percent.
S[uch developments represent **[a notable advance in]{.mark}** what is
called **[the energy transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the shift from
the current hydrocarbon-dominated energy mix to a low-carbon one
dominated by renewable sources. [**[Yet 2024 was a record year in

oil and coal]{.mark}** also **[hit all-time
highs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over a longer period, the **[share of
hydrocarbons in the global primary energy mix has hardly
budged]{.mark}**, from 85 percent in 1990 to about 80 percent today. [In
other words, what has been unfolding is **[not so much an "energy
transition" as an "energy addition.]{.mark}**]{.underline}" Rather than
replacing conventional energy sources[**[, the growth of
renewables]{.mark}** is coming **[on top of]{.mark}** that of
**[conventional sources.]{.mark}**]{.underline} And with [Donald
**[Trump's return to]{.mark}** the U.S. **[presidency,]{.mark}**
priorities **[will focus again on conventional energy production
and]{.mark}** what his administration calls **["energy dominance."
]{.mark}**]{.underline}This was not how the energy transition was
expected to proceed. [Concern about **[climate change]{.mark}** had
**[raised expectations for a rapid shift away from carbon-based fuels.
But t]{.mark}**he **[realities]{.mark}** of the global energy system
have **[confounded]{.mark}** those **[expectations, making clear that
the transition]{.mark}**---from an energy system based largely on oil,
gas, and coal to one based mostly on wind, solar, batteries, hydrogen,
and biofuels---**[will be]{.mark}** much more **[difficult, costly, and
complicated]{.mark}** than was initially expected]{.underline}. What's
more, the history of past energy transitions suggests that this should
not come as a surprise: those were also "energy additions," with each
adding to rather than eliminating prior sources. As a result, th[e
**[world is far from on track]{.mark}** to achieve the often stated
target of reaching, by 2050, "net-zero emissions"---a balance in which
any residual emissions are offset by removals of emissions from the
atmosphere. **[And there is no clear plan for getting on
track]{.mark}**]{.underline} or for delivering the magnitude of
investment that would be required to do so. The International Energy
Agency projected in 2021 that, for the world to meet 2050 targets,
greenhouse gas emissions would need to decline from 33.9 gigatons in
2020 to 21.2 gigatons in 2030; thus far, emissions have gone in the
other direction, reaching 37.4 gigatons in 2023 (and there's no reason
to think that a 40 percent decline in just seven years will be remotely
feasible). Other facts similarly reflect the challenges of transition.
The Biden administration set a goal of electric vehicles accounting for
50 percent of new cars sold in the United States by 2030; yet that
number remains just ten percent, with automakers slashing investment in
electric vehicles as they face multibillion-dollar losses[. Offshore
wind production in the United States was supposed to reach 30 gigawatts
by 2030 but will struggle to reach just 13 gigawatts by that
date]{.underline}. [And Trump administration policy changes will make
these gaps even larger. Part of **[the problem is sheer cost]{.mark}**
many trillions of dollars, with great uncertainty as to who is to pay

### AT Link -- No Link/No Moral Hazard

#### Geoengineering will not impede ongoing decarbonization efforts

Soheil **Shayegh**, 12/10/**19**, \[ayegh is a research scientist at the
European Institute on Economics and the Environment (EIEE) in Milano,
Italy\], Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, "Geoengineering is no
climate fix. But calling it a moral hazard could be counterproductive,"
https://thebulletin.org/2019/12/geoengineering-is-no-climate-fix-but-calling-it-a-moral-hazard-could-be-counterproductive/,
mm

Can moral hazard apply to geoengineering? [There are]{.underline}, in
general, [two ways of thinking about the moral hazar]{.underline}d
problem. [In neither case does geoengineering fit.]{.underline} F[irst,
moral hazard can be applied to cases with i]{.underline}mperfect or
[insufficient information]{.underline}. Imagine a case where you hire a
contractor to fix the air conditioning at your house. The contractor may
use low-quality materials to get your air conditioning back to work
quickly, but it leaves you exposed to higher costs down the road. Since
you do not have any expertise in determining what the contractor has
actually done, you are at his or her mercy. In other words, an easy fix,
combined with imperfect information, may discourage people from choosing
the right alternative. In the climate change realm, this may seem to be
the case at least when people are talking about solar radiation
management. Spraying aerosols into the atmosphere would only reduce the
global mean temperature--- it would not address the greenhouse gas
emission problem as the underlying cause. It seems like an easy fix that
will discourage or distract people from choosing the right alternative:
more serious emissions reduction efforts. However, this would only be
the case if we had insufficient information about the cause of climate
change and were only concerned about global temperature rise. But in
reality, [we have little doubt about the cause of climate
change]{.underline} or about the distinction between alternative options
to stop it. We are not by any means being kept in the dark about what
the various options entail. Furthermore, [not every climate-driven event
is related to temperature]{.underline}, and not every region or country
has the same desired temperature target that can be achieved by solar
radiation management. Therefore[, it is hard to conceive of a situation
in which geoengineering would be deployed in such a satisfactory way
that would dissuade people from seeking more substantial decarbonization
pathways]{.underline}. [The second approach]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} thinking about [moral hazard frames it as the problem
of illusive protection]{.underline}. [In this case, providing an easy
fix makes people take unnecessary risks]{.underline}, thinking that they
are immune to the consequences of their actions. A classic example is
the invention of the seat belts for cars---some say they pose a moral
hazard because they have led people to drive more carelessly. Those who
worry that geoengineering poses a moral hazard have argued that, in this
case, providing geoengineering options will encourage people to consume
more fossil fuels and care less about shifting to a green lifestyle.
However, this argument assumes that we know, rather perfectly, that
solar radiation management will work and will reduce the temperature. In
reality, we do not know how large-scale solar geoengineering works
because even small-scale experiments have not yet been undertaken.
Further, [even if it works perfectly, we do not know if it will provide
the protection that supposedly will give people the illusion of
immunity]{.underline}. The climate system is a highly complex and
interconnected collection of thousands of factors, and deploying solar
radiation management could be more dangerous than not doing it. In sum,
the moral hazard framework is a good way of thinking about problems
where there are two competing solutions, one hard but substantial and
the other one easy and rather superficial. The key here is that, for
moral hazard to apply, both options must be real and functioning. But
geoengineering is not a functioning option, much less an easy one. Those
who use the moral hazard framing to argue against geoengineering are
unwittingly reinforcing the mistaken notion that it might be some kind
of an insurance policy. The more scientists wring their hands about a
moral hazard, the more the public may come to see geoengineering as the
quick fix that it isn't. Geoengineering in many ways resembles genetic
engineering. Both technologies may hold promise in addressing serious
problems that humanity faces today. As genetic engineering would solve
only a subset of health issues and would not be a panacea, no serious
objection has been raised against it on the basis of moral hazard. No
one thinks that it will dissuade societies from investing in other areas
of medical science and public health. Similar to genetic engineering,
[geoengineering]{.underline} is not a final solution, nor an easy fix.
It [would be best understood as a complement to ongoing decarbonization
efforts]{.underline}---but only once the reliability, scalability, and
acceptability issues have been resolved. Using the moral hazard
framework is a distraction from the more fundamental ethical challenges
facing these technologies.

### AT Link -- Turn: Plan Increases Support for Cutting Emissions

#### Small-scale geoengineering experimentation disproves the link -- widespread adoption would [increase]{.underline} public support for cutting emissions

Pete **Irvine**, Tyler **Felgenhauer**, **and** Mark **Turner**,
11/26/**24**, SRM260, "Mitigation Displacement: Could SRM Undermine
Emissions Cuts?",
https://srm360.org/article/mitigation-displacement-could-srm-undermine-emissions-cuts/,
mm

[Could the promise that]{.underline} SRM \[[sunlight reflection
methods]{.underline}\] could reduce climate risks undermine efforts to
cut greenhouse gas emissions? There is a widespread concern that
researching and [developing SRM could reduce pressure to cut
emissions]{.underline}, helping to justify the continued use of
polluting fossil fuels.1 This concern is known as "mitigation
displacement", "mitigation deterrence", or "moral hazard".2 "Moral
hazard" is an idea from economics and insurance, suggesting that people
may act less responsibly if they feel insulated from the consequences of
their actions.1 Everyday examples include drivers acting more recklessly
because they feel protected by seatbelts and airbags, or a patient
eating less healthily after being prescribed a blood pressure medicine.
The jury is still out on whether SRM would undermine emissions cuts if
it were deployed. [The recent history of]{.underline} its research and
initial [experimentation]{.underline} [**shows no clear sign** of the
public or governments seeing SRM as a reason to reduce cuts to
emissions]{.underline}.3 Could this change as the idea of SRM becomes
more mainstream? One area of concern lies around the economic
calculations that inform climate policies, and their shortcomings.
Economic models play a key role in climate policy discussions: helping
to identify the lowest cost approaches for meeting goals and how to
balance the costs of emissions cuts against the costs of climate change
impacts. Making large cuts to emissions requires significant up-front
investment without immediate returns. SRM, on the other hand, could
offer a relatively inexpensive means of rapidly lowering temperatures,
though it would bring with it a long-term commitment.4 [Some interest
groups]{.underline} or even states [may advocate delaying]{.underline}
costly [emissions cuts]{.underline} on the basis that SRM offers a
cheaper solution, or because they are economically tied to the fossil
fuel economy. [But]{.underline} so far, [that argument has rarely been
made explicitly]{.underline}. [Public perception studies generally find
that people, after learning about SRM, do not on average show a change
in their support for policies to cut emissions]{.underline} -- that is
**[they generally find no mitigation displacement
effect]{.underline}**.5,6 [Some studies even find an inverse effect,
where after learning about SRM people **express a greater commitment to
cutting emissions**]{.underline}.6,7

#### SRM would increase support for mitigation efforts -- survey data and behavioral experiments prove

Jesse **Reynolds**, **2020**, WIREs Climate Change, 12(2), "Is solar
geoengineering ungovernable? A critical assessment of governance
challenges identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,"
https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.690, mm

Perhaps [the most widespread]{.underline} and influential
[concern]{.underline} [regarding SRM is that it could lessen
mitigation]{.underline}. AR5 \[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report \] expresses
this passively: "it has been argued that geoengineering could become a
distraction from urgent mitigation and adaptation measures" (IPCC,
2014b, p. 484, see also pp. 219, 488). According to SR1.5, "the
literature shows low agreement on whether SRM research and use may lead
policy-makers to reduce mitigation efforts" (IPCC, 2018, p. 349). [There
is no evidence that SRM\'s research and development would lessen
mitigation]{.underline} but instead only assertions of that effect. In
this sense, AR5 is correct: it has been argued. In contrast, SR1.5
speaks of the literature showing low agreement, yet the one scientific
article that is cited after the above quote (Linnér & Wibeck, 2015) does
not discuss SRM\'s potential effect on mitigation. In fact, [what
evidence there is **suggests the opposite**]{.underline}. [In almost all
opinion surveys and behavioral experiments that have explored this
possibility]{.underline}, [after learning about SRM or having it added
to their choices, respondents increase their concern about climate
change and/or support for mitigation]{.underline} (for references, see
Reynolds, 2019, pp. 37--40). This suggests that [SRM may be seen by many
as so undesirable that it leads them to realize climate change\'s
seriousness and mitigation\'s importance]{.underline}, a prospect that
SR1.5 does cautiously note. Of course, these surveys and experiments are
not dispositive about what will actually occur. The actions of future
decision-makers---who will face political pressures---will not
necessarily align with current laypersons\' preferences and choices. At
the same time, [decision-makers are influenced by popular sentiment.
Elected politicians rely on voters]{.underline}; [appointed officials
are accountable to elected ones; and businesses depend on customers.
Even authoritarian leaders are partially constrained by public
opinion]{.underline}. Thus[, if SRM\'s research and development were to
increase support for mitigation among the general
population,]{.underline} as suggested by the surveys and experiments to
date, [then similar shifts should be expected among
decision-maker]{.underline}s, albeit imperfectly so. In the end, the
IPCC\'s statements that SRM would be a distraction from or reduce
mitigation are speculations that are contrary to the existing empirical
evidence. [Even if the introduction of SRM]{.underline} into a mix of
responses to climate change [were to lessen mitigation]{.underline}
undertaken, [doing so could still be a net benefi]{.underline}t[. If SRM
could counteract climate change, then its use coupled with a modest
lessening of mitigation could,]{.underline} on the whole, [reduce net
climate risks]{.underline}. Such "risk compensation," in which the
introduction of a safety rule or technology causes an increase in the
underlying risky activity, is common in public policy (Hedlund, 2000).
Tellingly, the net result of the safety measure and the subsequent
compensatory behavioral change is usually a net reduction of harm, and
the risk-reducing rules and technologies are typically praised. Yet the
IPCC reports do not consider such a risk compensation scenario and
instead take into account only the negative consequences of SRM
potentially lessening mitigation but not its expected concomitant
benefits of reducing climate change. This would be analogous to
considering only that seat belts cause car drivers to drive faster while
neglecting the belts\' safety effects.

### AT Turns Case/Solves the Aff

#### Even an immediate halt to emissions wouldn't save the Arctic -- only geoengineering solves

Durwood **Zaelke**, 4/1/**19**, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, "How
to save the Arctic's moderating role on global warming,"
https://thebulletin.org/2019/04/how-to-save-the-arctics-moderating-role-on-global-warming/,
mm

The Arctic plays a critical role in maintaining a safe and stable global
climate, with its reflective sea ice that sends significant incoming
solar radiation safely back to space and its permanently frozen tundra
that secures ancient stores of carbon dioxide and methane. But [the
Arctic is warming at twice the global average]{.underline}, threatening
to break what may be the weakest link in the chain of climate
protection. The amplified Arctic warming is causing the reflective sea
ice to melt, exposing darker water that absorbs more incoming solar
radiation[. It also is causing]{.underline} permafrost to thaw,
releasing carbon dioxide and methane. Both processes are
self-[reinforcing feedback loops]{.underline}, in which initial warming
feeds upon itself to cause still more warming. Feeding warming and
making it stronger is not a strategy for success. The recent UN Arctic
report synthesizes existing research to show that [even if climate
emissions were halted today]{.underline}, [Arctic warming would continue
for **at least two decades**]{.underline}. [This is due to past and
present emissions]{.underline} and the return of heat stored in the
ocean, where 90 percent of the warming we've caused ends up. Of course
emissions are continuing. Fast mitigation at scale can still slow future
Arctic warming, starting with immediate cuts to the short-lived climate
pollutants---black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone, and
hydrofluorocarbons. Cutting emissions of these short-lived pollutants
immediately can reduce the rate of Arctic warming by up to two-thirds.
Fast cuts to carbon dioxide also are important, but over the next two
decades they will actually add warming. This is because co-emitted
cooling aerosols from fossil fuels like coal wash out of the atmosphere
in days to weeks and unmask existing warming, while much of the carbon
dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years to continue
causing warming. [Even with fast and dramatic]{.underline}
[cuts]{.underline} to short-lived pollutants, [the race to save
the]{.underline} safety functions of [the Arctic will]{.underline} now
[be]{.underline} [difficult]{.underline}. For starters, [the Arctic is
projected to become ice free]{.underline} in the summer months [within
15 years]{.underline}, with an uncertainty range of plus or minus 10
years, so perhaps as soon at five years, or if we're unusually lucky,
perhaps 25 years. Losing the reflective ice shield will add tremendous
warming to the Arctic, which will spread significant warming throughout
the globe. The permafrost also is thawing, releasing more carbon dioxide
and methane, a super climate pollutant 84 times more potent than carbon
dioxide over the next two decades. Because the Arctic's role in
regulating the global climate is a critical link in the chain of climate
protection---and perhaps the weakest link---it should be the focus of an
all-out effort to keep it strong and safe. This requires cutting
emissions of short-lived pollutants, as California has shown the world
how to do. It also requires speeding up strategies to remove carbon
dioxide we've already emitted, including natural processes that use
photosynthesis to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it
in trees, grasslands, wetlands, and other biomass, while using the root
systems to rebuild soil carbon. Other strategies for capturing and
utilizing carbon dioxide in products are getting ready to move to
commercial scale, meaning that costs would drop rapidly. Finally, we
need a crash program to speed mechanical means of direct air capture of
carbon dioxide, as many leading scientists and climate experts are
advocating. With the need to remove up to a trillion (1,000 billion)
tons of carbon dioxide over the century, this will be a whale of a
market opportunity. Can the world meet this challenge, even as global
emissions are going up again after three years of no growth, and coal,
the worst climate polluter, remains stubbornly near its historic level
globally at 27 percent of the world's energy mix, with projections that
it will decline only slightly to 25 percent by 2023? Equally troubling,
the US is now one of the leading producers of crude oil, rivaling both
Russia and Saudi Arabia and on target by 2025 to produce as much as both
combined. How much harder will it be for the United States to pursue a
low-emissions climate policy, when it must wrestle with the growing
geopolitical power related to such oil dominance? The oil majors and
their investors are predicting increasing demand for fossil fuel
products over at least the next couple of decades, although their future
is now threatened by growing carbon constraints, including lawsuits to
make the oil majors pay for the climate pollution they've contributed
for decades after they knew the risk their products were causing.
Establishing the liability of the fossil fuel industry for climate
impacts and making polluters pay for them would help remove the single
biggest barrier to climate protection. But such a legal outcome is not
enough to deal with the overall climate problem, nor is it guaranteed to
occur. The desperate race to maintain the Arctic's stabilizing role in
the global climate means [we]{.underline} also [need to put
geoengineering squarely into the policy mix]{.underline}, and risk the
hazards, moral or otherwise, this could present. We should start with
"soft" geoengineering that can be scaled up and reversed if side effects
become too troubling. One example is Ice911's strategy to use
silica-based glass microspheres to cover thin, first-year ice in the
Arctic to enhance reflectivity and grow stronger multiyear ice. It's
working in small experiments, and could be scaled up quickly, with
careful monitoring for side effects. While riskier, another
geoengineering strategy involves the introduction of cooling particles
into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation back to space, as
observed following the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the
Philippines. [Solar geoengineering may be able to cut half the warming
from a doubling of carbon dioxide]{.underline}, according to the results
of an idealized model experiment that showed this could be done without
exacerbating temperature, water availability, extreme temperature, or
extreme precipitation in any region. Nevertheless, the threat that some
regions could be harmed by this strategy will continue to cast a long
shadow and make such a policy course challenging to enact. Such a
strategy would be even more problematic if sulfate particles were used,
as this would delay recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer.

#### Reducing emissions won't solve -- locked-in warming is sufficient to melt the Arctic -- geoengineering is key

Since Arctic sea ice loss is predominantly anthropogenic in origin, the
logically simplest way to restore the ice is to refrain from engaging in
the activities that have increased mean surface temperatures. In other
words[, solving the global climate change]{.underline} problem
[would]{.underline} largely [solve the problem of Arctic sea ice loss.
As a practical matter]{.underline}, **[this is not a
solution,]{.underline}** [as political efforts to decrease CO2 emissions
and other human activities have proved ineffective]{.underline}. Also
[even if anthropogenic forcings]{.underline} on the global climate such
as CO2 emissions [were to abate]{.underline}, [this would not change the
current trends in mean temperature for the next several
decades]{.underline}, **[too late to prevent loss of summer sea ice in
the 2030s]{.underline}**. [Restoring Arctic sea]{.underline}
[ice]{.underline} thus probably [requires a local solution]{.underline}
tailored to that part of the climate system. Happily, though, any
prevention of Arctic sea ice loss has the advantage of arresting the
most powerful feedback in the climate system and making the global
climate change easier to deal with.

Based on this elaborated analysis, it is possible to advance some
preliminary conclusions. First, [to the extent that oil wealth has a
consistent effect, the evidence suggests **it is generally a peaceful
one**]{.underline}. All else equal, [oil-producing countries tend to be
less aggressive toward their neighbors]{.underline} than non-oil
producers [once we account for the]{.underline} statistical [outlier
that is the Iran--Iraq War]{.underline}. This relationship holds across
multiple measurement choices and model specifications. [Even
revolutionary oil-producing countries are no more bellicose than
revolutionary non-oil-producing countries.]{.underline} When we account
for the Iran--Iraq War, oil prices also, whether alone or interacted
with oil wealth and radical leadership, have at best an inconsistent
impact on the risk of interstate conflict. In short, [the
relationships]{.underline} we find here [suggest the possibility of an
oil peace]{.underline}. What remains open to investigation are the
mechanisms that might link oil wealth to more peaceful international
behavior. Are they primarily domestic or systemic? And which
implications of oil wealth at each level appear to be steering
substantial oil producers toward more pacific international roles? To
the extent that oil-producing countries are more peaceful than non-oil
producers, it may well suggest a need to "normalize" oil producers as
ones whose behavior is explained by the commercial peace thesis like
that of producers of other commodities. These questions of causal
process are an obvious next step for scholarship seeking to reconcile
the inconsistency of the oil--interstate war thesis with the suggestive
evidence for an oil peace. Methodologically, our findings here suggest
several things. First, it is past time to bring measurement choices in
the oil--interstate war research agenda up to date. The data we analyze
here for oil and gas income per capita, which is publicly archived,
employs the best available measure of oil abundance and its original
form extends from 1932 to 2014. For scholars seeking to complement that
with a ratio measure of dependence, best practices in the resource curse
research program most often now use oil/gas income as a share of GDP
rather than only export revenues. Moreover, we lack any good empirical
or theoretical reasons to establish categorical boundaries between what
is a "petrostate" and what is not, and unless and until we do, it makes
more sense to use continuous data. Second, unless there are solid
reasons to dismiss system-level causal factors in our statistical models
(and there are certainly not at present---on the contrary, nearly all
current studies of war onset find multiple important determinants at
this level of analysis), scholars should employ random-effects
estimators. Finally, [what stands out]{.underline} in this set of
analyses [is the centrality of Middle East geopolitical
dynamics]{.underline} during the last half of the twentieth century.
[The Iran--Iraq War looms large in explaining interstate
conflict]{.underline} not just in that region but [in the global
sample]{.underline}. Accounting for the dynamics of that war, in
particular the large numbers of disputes initiated by one of the
participants against third-party countries, [we find strong support for
region-specific theories of bellicosity]{.underline}. It is long past
necessary to note that domestic politics often matters for international
relations, but closer attention in the future to other regional dynamics
could illuminate additional important patterns in the field of
interstate conflict studies. [This statistical "glitch" argues for
closer attention to regional particularities]{.underline} that might
covary systematically with war determinants and methodologically
suggests that astute econometric research could benefit from
reengagement with close-range regional expertise. In this case, at
least, area studies acumen revealed a very different pattern of
international conflict across the globe. [In the twenty-first
century]{.underline}, [in which there are now as many as fifty
substantial oil-producing countries around the world,]{.underline}
est[ablishing that there is an oil peace]{.underline}
[carries]{.underline} both [important]{.underline} scholarly [and policy
implications]{.underline}.

#### The resource curse is wrong -- oil states are not more aggressive than non-oil states

Studies, 30(2), "Pax Petrolica? Rethinking the Oil-Interstate War
Linkage,"

[The "resource curse]{.underline}," a concept originally coined by
Richard M. Auty more than a quarter century ago, [has become a mainstay
of international]{.underline} and comparative [politics]{.underline}.
From autocracy to civil war onset to women's economic marginalization,
the linking of dysfunctional political phenomena to resource wealth
today is more of a factory industry than a cottage one. In the last
decade, the research program has turned to oil as a catalyst of
interstate conflict, arguing that oil-rich countries are more likely to
initiate disputes, armed or otherwise, with their neighbors. On its
face, it is a reasonable argument to make: Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the
post-Saddam occupation has consumed so much of the world's attention
since 1991 that it would seem challenging to suggest the link is
tenuous. It is also plausible, as several recent studies conclude, that
the effect has broad comparative implications. [We suggest here that the
evidence for petro-aggression **is in fact quite weak**,]{.underline}
and we present an alternative framework for understanding a potential
oil peace. The [results]{.underline} below [suggest an association
between oil and more peaceful, not more bellicose, international
behavior]{.underline}. In this sense, we concur with the underemphasized
component of Jeff D. Colgan's argument that [oil can be associated with
peace]{.underline}. Our analysis demonstrates that [Middle East
geopolitics, rather than oil wealth, largely drives the]{.underline}
putative [relationship between radical petrostates and interstate
conflic]{.underline}ts. [In fact]{.underline}, [a single]{.underline}
Middle East [conflict]{.underline} [between]{.underline} two
states---[Iran and Iraq]{.underline} between 1980 and 1988---[accounts
for previous findings suggesting a global correlation between oil and
interstate war]{.underline}. [The evidence is generally more suggestive
of a Pax Petrolica than it is of petro-aggression]{.underline}. This
article proceeds as follows. First, we briefly situate our inquiry in
the extant research suggesting a causal relationship between oil wealth
and the initiation of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Second, we
develop our theory of an oil peace. We also hypothesize a
disproportionate impact of the Iran--Iraq War. We build on the
observation that one regional conflict lasting for nearly a decade
happened to occur between two of the world's most significant oil
producers and involved more than one hundred MIDs by one of the two
states against noncombatant third parties. [Once we account for these
regional dynamics, we see a more accurate picture of the links between
oil and dispute initiation]{.underline}. Third, it builds on analysis of
cross-national time-series data from 1945--2010 and data from prominent
recent studies to explore oil's role in interstate conflict. Based on
these analyses, [we find reason to believe oil producers are generally
less likely to initiate interstate conflicts than oil-poor
states.]{.underline} Further, we find that the dynamics of the
Iran--Iraq War account for nearly all the impact that prior scholarship
argued was a function of oil in the hands of radical leaders. The essay
concludes with suggestions for future research aimed at improving the
quality of theory, concepts, and measures related to the study of oil
wealth and international conflict.

### AT Petrostates ! -- Petrostates Inevitable

#### Decarbonization will not displace petrostate -- emerging fossil fuel markets will sustain demand 

Andreas **Goldthau** **and** Kirsten **Westphal**, **2019**, Global
Policy, 10(2), "Why the Global Energy transitions does not mean the end
of the petrostate,"
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12649, mm

[[The global energy transformation does not]{.mark} mean]{.underline}
[the [end]{.mark} of [the petrostate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
low carbon [transition]{.mark} [may]{.mark}]{.underline} in fact well
[[facilitate new oligopolies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and a higher market
concentration among fewer crude suppliers]{.underline}. [As
energy‐intensive sectors dislocate from fast‐decarbonizing OECD
countries, this presents oil producer countries with new export
opportunities in refined oil products and in the fast-growing
petrochemicals sector.]{.underline} '[[Peak demand' will remain]{.mark}
an OECD‐centered phenomenon [for the foreseeable
future]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with growth in oil consumption 'moving
East']{.mark} before eventually also flattening out there]{.underline}.
[[For]{.mark} traditional [oil exporters this opens inroads into]{.mark}
the new demand centers in [South East Asia (and Latin
America]{.mark}).]{.underline} [In the long run, oil will cease to play
a role in a low carbon energy system. Until then, it will continue
filling the pockets of a significant number of petrostates]{.underline}.
An important policy challenge will lie in dealing with the very high
cost producers whose social contract obligations deprive them of viable
alternatives to 'panic and pump', and whose short‐term political outlook
may include the possibility of collapse. Fast decarbonizers, i.e. mostly
the rich world, will need to prepare for tipping points at which the
rising spread between the social and the market price of oil fatally
tilts the domestic politics against these countries incumbent regimes.
The speed of the decarbonization pathway will play an important role in
that regard. **[[The energy geopolitics of a low carbon future might for
some time resemble the ones of the fossil past]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Fast decarbonizers committed to making the bright clean energy future
work will therefore need to prepare for a two‐fold challenge: managing a
rapidly changing energy system in order to secure the transformation
dividends it will bring, for human security and economic welfare
(Goldthau, Keim, and Westphal 2018); and balancing the (geo)political
afterpains of the incumbent fuels leaving the system.

#### The global energy transitions will strengthen major petrostates -- offshoring and Cartel thinning will leave the major fossil fuel producers intact

Andreas **Goldthau** **and** Kirsten **Westphal**, **2019**, Global
Policy, 10(2), "Why the Global Energy transitions does not mean the end
of the petrostate,"
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12649, mm

[[The global energy transition might]{.underline}]{.mark}, ironically,
[even [throw]{.mark} some [petrostates an additional
lifeline]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark} the most
committed]{.underline} and fast-moving [[countries]{.mark}
[decarbonize]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} inevitably [shed]{.mark} some of
[their]{.mark} most [energy‐intensive sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
includes refined products and petrochemicals -- the fastest growing
source of crude consumption (IEA 2018a). These will either no longer be
produced at economic costs in the 'early decarbonizers' when factoring
in significant carbon levies; or will have to go because of
policy‐induced climate targets. [As it is mainly OECD economies leading
the way, their [remaining demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [such products
will be satisfied by imports]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least for some
time to come. [[This]{.mark} [presents]{.mark} [an opportunity to
countries]{.mark} that have already started [to move up the energy value
chain]{.mark} by building up refining capacity and developing a viable
petrochemical industry]{.underline} [-- such as several Gulf
states]{.underline} (IEA 2018b), 80). A combination of low feedstock
costs, abundant availability of the raw products and a demand push by
the early decarbonizers will likely prove a good business case for Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait. It will also be a welcome
hedging strategy against faltering reve‐ nues from raw commodity
exports. In fact, given their comparative advantage, moving further into
the high‐carbon niche proves most rational for these petrostates.
Accordingly, [[the IEA projects the Middle East to become a significant
producer of petrochemical products]{.mark} by 2040]{.underline} (IEA
2018c). While especially European companies have closed down or sold
their refineries in the past two decades, Saudi Aramco, the UAE's ADNOC
but also Rosneft have stepped up their engagement or are planning
significant expansion (IEA 2018a; ) IEA 2018b),104f). What is more[, [a
changing market environment]{.mark} thanks to decarbonization also
[means]{.mark} that several incumbent, high‐reserve but high‐cost
producers will leave the playing field]{.underline}. [[OPEC may well
shrink]{.underline},]{.mark} as some of its club members such as
Venezuela or Libya may find it hard to retain their mid‐ to long‐term
status as a net exporter. This adds to Angola and other lower‐reserve
producers possibly adopting a short term 'panic and pump' strategy,
resulting in them effectively abandoning the organization's collective
decision‐making procedures. [[The clear upside]{.mark} of the producer
cartel shedding members [is a smaller organization, stronger homogeneity
and hence stronger internal cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}. This raises
the veritable possibility of market collusion at a so far unprecedented
level. What looks like a rather remote option today -- OPEC indeed
speaking with one voice --, for reasons related to strong adverse
incentives and collective action problems (Goldthau and Witte 2011),
might become a reality thanks to the low carbon transition.
Structurally, [[the global energy transformation might]{.mark} therefore
[strengthen the hands of]{.mark} precisely the [countries]{.mark} that
are commonly [believed to lose out]{.mark} as part of the world waving
goodbye to the crude politics surrounding oil]{.underline}.

### AT Ocean Acidification ! -- Defense

#### Ocean acidification isn't a threat -- even worst-case climate scenarios won't result in widespread ocean acidification

H. Sterling **Burnett**, 5/25/**21**, Climate Realism, "Sorry, EPA, Your
Own Data Shows Oceans Aren't Becoming Acidic,"
https://climaterealism.com/2021/05/sorry-epa-your-own-data-show-oceans-arent-becoming-acidic/,
mm

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought back its Climate
Change Indicator's platform last week. In EPA's website page, titled
"Climate Change Indicators: Ocean Acidity," the agency tries to stoke
fears human carbon dioxide emissions threaten to make the oceans acidic.
This is untrue. As [the data EPA cites]{.underline} actually [shows
oceans are and will remain alkaline under any reasonably expected
increase in ocean carbon dioxide concentration]{.underline}s.
"Measurements made over the last few decades have demonstrated that
ocean carbon dioxide levels have risen in response to increased carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in acidity (that is, a
decrease in pH)," writes EPA. "\[R\]ising levels of carbon dioxide
dissolved in the ocean can have a negative effect on some marine life
... mak\[ing\] it more difficult for these animals to thrive." The data
EPA cites to make these claims support neither claim. [Oceans are not in
danger of becoming acidic]{.underline}, and rising carbon dioxide levels
are, in fact, benefitting most sea life.

As Climate at a Glance: Ocean Acidification explains, "A pH of 7 is
considered neutral, with anything below 7 considered acidic. [Ocean pH
averages 8.1, which is alkaline rather than acidic. Although climate
models suggest the oceans' surface pH may have dropped from pH 8.2 to
8.1 since 1750,]{.underline} that change was never actually measured.
The pH drop is merely a modeled conjecture."

Note that sea water has a normal ph of 8.1 by the EPA's own admission,
and none of the highly magnified graphs illustrated on the new EPA
website seen in figure 2 below get anywhere close to 7.0 or below, which
is the acidic range on the pH scale. In fact, EPA doesn't even show 7.0
on any of those graphs, making it misleading.

Ocean Acidity

[We are]{.underline} already [more than halfway towards the feared
doubling of carbon dioxide levels]{.underline} since the industrial
revolution in 1850. [Yet, according to climate model simulations, the pH
of surface ocean waters has fallen]{.underline} [by, at most, 0.1 pH
units]{.underline}. **[This modest decline in pH is a long way from
acidic]{.underline}**. [There is no reason for believing oceans will
become acidic at the levels various climate models project carbon
dioxide concentrations will peak, even under the most extreme
scenarios]{.underline}.

### AT Ocean Acidification -- Arctic Melt -\> Acidification

#### Arctic ice melt leads to rapid ocean acidification

Beth **Miller**, 9/29/**22**, UD Daily, "Fast-Melting Ice May Contribute
to Ocean Acidification,"
https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2022/september/arctic-ocean-acidification-climate-sea-ice-wei-jun-cai/,
mm

Wei-Jun Cai, an expert in marine chemistry at the University of
Delaware, is sounding new alarm bells about the changing chemistry of
the western region of the Arctic Ocean, where he and [an international
team]{.underline} of collaborators have found acidity levels increasing
three to four times faster than ocean waters elsewhere. They also
[identified a strong correlation between the accelerated rate of melting
ice]{.underline} in the region [and the rate of ocean
acidificatio]{.underline}n, a perilous combination that threatens the
survival of plants, shellfish, coral reefs and other marine life and
biological processes throughout the planet's ecosystem. [The new
study,]{.underline} published on Thursday, Sept. 30 in Science, the
flagship journal of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, [is the first analysis of Arctic acidification]{.underline}
[that includes data from more than two decades]{.underline}, spanning
the period from 1994 to 2020. [Scientists have predicted that by
2050]{.underline} --- if not sooner --- [Arctic sea ice]{.underline} in
this region [will no longer survive]{.underline} the increasingly warm
[summer seasons. As a]{.underline} result of this sea-ice retreat each
summer, [the ocean's chemistry will grow more acidic,]{.underline} [with
no persistent ice cover]{.underline} [to slow or otherwise mitigate the
advance]{.underline}. That creates life-threatening problems for the
enormously diverse population of sea creatures, plants and other living
things that depend on a healthy ocean for survival. Crabs, for example,
live in a crusty shell built from the calcium carbonate prevalent in
ocean water. Polar bears rely on healthy fish populations for food, fish
and sea birds rely on plankton and plants, and seafood is a key element
of many humans' diets. That makes acidification of these distant waters
a big deal for many of the planet's inhabitants. First, a quick
refresher course on pH levels, which indicate how acidic or alkaline a
given liquid is. Any liquid that contains water can be characterized by
its pH level, which ranges from 0 to 14, with pure water considered
neutral with a pH of 7. All levels lower than 7 are acidic, all levels
greater than 7 are basic or alkaline, with each full step representing a
tenfold difference in the hydrogen ion concentration. Examples on the
acidic side include battery acid, which checks in at 0 pH, gastric acid
(1), black coffee (5) and milk (6.5). Tilting toward basic are blood
(7.4), baking soda (9.5), ammonia (11) and drain cleaner (14). Seawater
is normally alkaline, with a pH value of around 8.1. Cai, the Mary A.S.
Lighthipe Professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy in UD's
College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, has published significant
research on the changing chemistry of the planet's oceans and this month
completed a cruise from Nova Scotia to Florida, serving as chief
scientist among 27 aboard the research vessel. The work, supported by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), includes
four areas of study: The East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific
Coast and the Alaska/Arctic region. The new study in Science included UD
postdoctoral researcher Zhangxian Ouyang, who participated in a recent
voyage to collect data in the Chukchi Sea and Canada Basin in the Arctic
Ocean. The first author on the publication was Di Qi, who works with
Chinese research institutes in Xiamen and Qingdao. Also collaborating on
this publication were scientists from Seattle, Sweden, Russia and six
other Chinese research sites. "You can't just go by yourself," Cai said.
"This international collaboration is very important for collecting
long-term data over a large area in the remote ocean. In recent years,
we have also collaborated with Japanese scientists as accessing the
Arctic water was even harder in the past three years due to COVID-19.
And we always have European scientists participating." Cai said he and
Qi both were baffled when they first reviewed the Arctic data together
during a conference in Shanghai. The acidity of the water was increasing
three to four times faster than ocean waters elsewhere. That was
stunning indeed. But why was it happening? Cai soon identified a prime
suspect: the increased melt of sea ice during the Arctic's summer
season. Historically, the Arctic's sea ice has melted in shallow
marginal regions during the summer seasons. That started to change in
the 1980s, Cai said, but waxed and waned periodically. [In the past 15
years, the ice melt has accelerated, advancing into the deep basin in
the north]{.underline}. For a while, scientists thought the melting ice
could provide a promising "carbon sink," where carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere would be sucked into the cold, carbon-hungry waters that had
been hidden under the ice. That cold water would hold more carbon
dioxide than warmer waters could and might help to offset the effects of
increased carbon dioxide elsewhere in the atmosphere. When Cai first
studied the Arctic Ocean in 2008, he saw that the ice had melted beyond
the Chukchi Sea in the northwest corner of the region, all the way to
the Canada Basin --- far beyond its typical range. He and his
collaborators found that the fresh meltwater did not mix into deeper
waters, which would have diluted the carbon dioxide. Instead, the
surface water soaked up the carbon dioxide until it reached about the
same levels as in the atmosphere and then stopped collecting it. They
reported this result in a paper in Science in 2010. [That would also
change the pH level of the Arctic waters, they knew, reducing the
alkaline levels of the seawater and reducing its ability to resist
acidification.]{.underline} But how much? And how soon? It took them
another decade to collect enough data to derive a sound conclusion on
the long-term acidification trend. Analyzing data gathered from 1994 to
2020 -- the first time such a long-term perspective was possible ---
Cai, Qi and their collaborators found an extraordinary increase in
acidification and a strong correlation with the increasing rate of
melting ice. [They point to sea-ice melt **as the key mechanism** to
explain this rapid pH decrease,]{.underline} because it changes the
physics and chemistry of the surface water in three primary ways: [The
water under the sea ice, which had a deficit of carbon dioxide, now is
exposed to the atmospheric carbon dioxide and can take up carbon dioxide
freely]{.underline}. The seawater mixed with meltwater is light and
cannot mix easily into deeper waters, which means the carbon dioxide
taken from the atmosphere is concentrated at the surface. The meltwater
dilutes the carbonate ion concentration in the seawater, weakening its
ability to neutralize the carbon dioxide into bicarbonate and rapidly
decreasing ocean pH. Cai said more research is required to further
refine the above mechanism and better predict future changes, but the
data so far show again the far-reaching ripple effects of climate
change. "[If all of the multiple-year ice is replaced by first-year ice,
then]{.underline} there will be lower alkalinity and lower buffer
capacity and [acidification continues]{.underline}," he said. "By 2050,
we think all of the ice will be gone in the summer. Some papers predict
that will happen by 2030. And if we follow the current trend for 20 more
years, the summer acidification will be really, really strong." No one
knows exactly what that will do to the creatures and plants and other
living things that depend on healthy ocean waters.

**SRM360**, 5/14/**25**, "SRM Funding Overview,"

[The US has been the world's largest source of SRM-related]{.underline}
\[sunlight reflection methods\] [funding]{.underline} through to 2024,
with about \$102.2m given from public and private sources. It is
followed by Australia (\$22.6m), the UK (\$17.5m), Israel (\$16.1m), and
the European Union (EU, \$6.7m). Some EU member countries have provided
an additional \$12.9m. For funds committed through 2030, the UK will see
a considerable increase to \$121.1m, making it the world's second
largest funding source, when considering both governmental and
philanthropic contributions. [The Anglosphere in general has established
a significant lead in this field.]{.underline} Together, funders in the
US, UK, Australia, and Canada have spent \$145.0m on SRM up until the
end of 2024, comprising 76% of all global funding. This Anglosphere lead
is projected to grow substantially when considering future funding
commitments, rising to 85%. This is in large part due to recent UK
commitments, including that of UK's ARIA, which will become the largest
single source of SRM funding globally. In May 2025, ARIA announced
funding awards totalling around \$60.0m with additional funding reserved
for possible extensions. [By contrast, the EU, China, and India are
playing **a significantly smaller role.**]{.underline} The European
Union has committed only \$6.7m to this topic through 2024. Combining
this with the additional contributions of individual member states --
the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, France, and Italy --
the total funding in the EU rises to \$19.6m, only one fifth of the US
total. [China has spent only \$1.8m on SRM-related work through 2024, a
tiny fraction of its approximate \$500 billion research and development
expenditure]{.underline}. Though Indian organisations receive SRM
funding, we did not find evidence that Indian governmental,
philanthropic, or commercial organisations were a source of SRM funding.

#### China isn't going to deploy geoengineering tech in the status quo

Zhang **Zizhu**, 11/9/**2020**, Dialogue Earth, "Has 'geoengineering'
arrived in China?",
https://dialogue.earth/en/climate/how-to-supervise-geoengineering/, mm

[The 2015-19 Chinese geoengineering research project]{.underline} led by
John Moore was a joint undertaking by Beijing Normal University,
Zhejiang University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It
[modelled]{.underline} and analysed the mechanisms and [climate impacts
of geoengineering]{.underline}, and evaluated its integrated social
impacts and possible governance frameworks. "What China has done in
terms of geoengineering is very significant globally," Moore said,
describing it as a "larger and more sustained effort than people have
been able to do so far internationally." To increase the applicability
of its findings, the research team tried to link its models with
agricultural, economic and health outcomes. For example, what economic
impact will differing levels of carbon release from Arctic permafrost
have in various geoengineering or emissions scenarios? China is
vulnerable to climate disasters, and the project sparked speculation
that it plans to roll out geoengineering in response. Moore said that so
far, th[e project's experiments are limited to computer models and the
laborator]{.underline}y. He says [China will not take action before an
international consensus has formed]{.underline}, and covering one
glacier or cloud-seeding do not count as geoengineering. Chen Ying has
noted that [very few people in China are discussing such
interventions]{.underline}, [and academics and policymakers are not up
to speed on the topic -- and so **it is too soon to talk of
deployment**]{.underline}. "If academics and the government don't take
the field seriously, it's even harder for the public to understand it,"
she said.

### AT Politics -- AT Link: Plan = Bipartisan

#### Solar geoengineering will be bipartisan -- it can generate a coalition between pragmatic Democrats and corporatist Republicans

mm

Although public awareness of SG within the US is currently low [two
factors may complicate this model of climate polarisation]{.underline}.
Firstly, "[left/right" polarisation may be less important in determining
views on SG]{.underline} than a divide between "Prometheans" confident
of humanity's ability to control nature and "Soterians" who are
instinctively suspicious of "unnatural technological solutions and the
hubris of mastery projects". In this political environment, conservative
Republicans doubtful of mankind's contribution towards climate change
may form an unlikely coalition with environmental activists who view SG
as a dangerous distraction from climate change mitigation. Conversely,
[pragmatic Democrats eager to "buy time" for long-term climate solutions
may align with corporatist Republicans who see in SG an opportunity to
maintain existing economic structures]{.underline}. Indeed, a [coalition
in support of MCB deployment could include such diverse voices as former
Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich]{.underline}, who made the
conservative case for SG deployment in 2008, [and]{.underline}
Democratic President [Joe Biden,]{.underline} who authorized a report on
SG in 2022. [It is therefore possible that the politics of SG may
transcend traditional political polarisation, enabling a wider potential
coalition of support for MCB deployment]{.underline}.

Sometime in 2018, Harvard engineers David Keith and Frank Keutsch hope
to test spraying from a high-altitude balloon over Arizona, in order to
assess the risks and benefits of deployment on a larger scale. Keith
cancelled a similar planned experiment in New Mexico in 2012, but
announced he was ready for field testing at a geoengineering forum in
Washington on Friday. "The context for discussing solar geoengineering
research has changed substantially since we planned and funded this
forum nearly one year ago," a forum briefing paper noted. While
geoengineering received little favour under Obama, [**[high-level
officials within the Trump administration have been]{.mark}** long-time
**[advocates]{.mark}** for planetary-scale manipulation of Earth
systems. David Schnare, an architect of Trump's Environmental Protection
Agency transition, has lobbied the US government and testified to Senate
in favour of federal support **[for

### AT Politics -- AT Link Turns Case/Rollback

#### No rollback -- even opponents of geoengineering wouldn't risk termination shock

Andy **Parker** **and** Peter **Irvine**, March **2018**, \[Parker works

Germany; Irvine works at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and
Applied Sciences, Harvard University\], Earth's Future, 6(3), "The Risk
of Termination Shock from Solar Geoengineering",

Reflecting on the physical characteristics of termination shock and our
analysis of scenarios by which driver events could lead to termination,
we make two broad arguments: There would be a strong motivation to
maintain an SRM system and avoid termination shock. The projected
technical characteristics of SRM mean that it should be relatively easy
to make a system that would be highly robust and resilient against most
proposed drivers of termination. [Regarding the motivation to avoid
termination shock, once SRM is deployed to a level at which its
termination would produce large damages, it seems self-evident that
there would be **a strong and widely held incentive** to maintain the
system.]{.underline} The threat of termination shock is already a
central concern about SRM development, and we expect that this concern
would only increase if the use of SRM ever appeared to be a realistic
prospect. [We draw parallels to the level of societal effort that goes
toward protecting and maintaining critical infrastructure]{.underline}.
Where damage to infrastructure would present immediate dangers, there is
often a high level of security (as with nuclear power plants or
airports). Where prolonged interruption of the infrastructure service
would be dangerous, there is often investment in backup systems. For
example, to ensure reliable electricity supplies, countries maintain
spare power stations while hospitals have backup generators. Looking
internationally, the European Union, China, and Russia have developed
their own independent satellite navigation systems to parallel the
original US global positioning system, even though they are able to use
the American system. While there would be opposition to SRM use under
any deployment scenario, [we believe that even where people]{.underline}
or states [were initially opposed to the deployment of SRM, this would
be unlikely to carry over to support for sudden termination]{.underline}
in the majority of cases. [To argue by analogy we believe that few
people who opposed the construction of a nuclear power plant near their
homes would want it to be shut down by removing the cooling rods and
allowing a meltdown]{.underline}. Instead, we contend opponents would
lambast the original decision to build the plant while agitating for it
to be decommissioned as quickly and safely as possible. Similarly, we
believe that regardless of initial antipathy to the use of SRM, most in
favour of ending deployment would prefer to see it phased out carefully
rather than terminated suddenly.

The subdivision shown in Fig. 1 focused primarily on cultural and
economic factors, even though political and physical geography were also
initially considered, because prior experience suggested that
development outcomes in any given location in the Arctic may not be
completely tied to its national government or national borders. For
example, in the Barents sub-region there is a rich history of
international cooperation among the countries and Indigenous Peoples.
This sub-region spans very different governance structures and political
ideologies; cooperation has been facilitated by common goals rooted in
shared cultural and economic principles. After the 2022 full-scale
invasion of Ukraine, many areas of Barents sub-region cooperation across
borders with Russia rooted in economic goals and cultural histories
slowed or halted, highlighting that [conceptions of
**similarities**]{.underline} and linkages [within the **Arctic** are
not]{.underline} necessarily **[enduring]{.underline}**. The discussion
section returns to this issue in more detail.

Identification and prioritization of selected Arctic 2050 outcomes

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Delphi [[exercise]{.mark} relied
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} questionnaires about [possible **[Arctic
development]{.mark}** outcomes]{.underline} in 2050. [The research team
[**defined** development]{.mark}]{.underline} by [combining ideas in
**several** sources to arrive at [the act of
altering]{.mark}]{.underline} existing **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
(fixed or mobile) [or land, ocean, **[atmosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and/or electromagnetic spectrum use for the purpose of economic growth
or to improve quality of life; or the application of technology for the
production of new goods and services (Arctic Council undated; Arctic
Economic Council undated; Wynne Houck 2022). The research team used a
dictionary definition for outcome, namely something that follows as a
result or consequence (Merriam Webster undated).
