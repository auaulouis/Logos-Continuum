# Notes

Every card in this file, except for the "AT Sustainability Directive"
block, is affirmative. That block responds to an AI-generated set of
Arctic development definitions and would probably be used by the
negative.

All 'development' definitions are in the context of the Arctic,
providing a predictability and context-based reason to prefer against
T-minerals/extraction (where no cards are about the Arctic). The few
definitions in the counter-interpretation section that don't explicitly
say 'Arctic' are from articles about it- you can tell from the citation
if it's not in the text of the evidence.

All aff development counterinterpretations are much broader, but that's
also the reality of the word 'development'. Narrow interpretations of it
aren't really supported by the literature. Winning this means investing
in topic education and predictability as more important than limits, as
well as making functional limits arguments (for example, the Alaska do
the plan CP probably limits out most affirmatives centered on
development as well-being).

I don't have a universal 2ac counter-interpretation because some
evidence fits certain affs better than others.

You probably don't want to read the 'extraction definitions bad' cards
if your affirmative also harms the interests of Arctic indigenous
peoples.

//DH

Recently, the Arctic began to be treated as a "geopolitical hotspot" and
as a "resource frontier." The region's international (i.e., interstate)
dynamics has been drawing the attention of scholars and policymakers
seeking to make sense (and take advantage) of emerging geopolitical and
economic phenomena in the region. One of the main drivers of such
efforts is the so-called Arctic resource boom -- an enhanced knowledge
on the resource endowment of Arctic seas and lands, especially in terms
of the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral reserves. Since the
publication of the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008, such
knowledge of the region has only increased, and triggered a plethora of
economic development projects for the region -- most geared towards
making the commercial exploitation of such resources viable. Such plans,
typical of [neo-**[extractivist modes of
development]{.mark}**]{.underline} and capital accumulation,1) demand
new instruments and technologies of control over land, territory and
resources -- not only in enabling the resource exploitation, but also in
displacing Arctic Indigenous populations that inhabit spaces where
resource-based economic activity is meant to take place. This process
has been coupled with a range of practices aimed at controlling space
and mobilities in indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis calls "striation
activities". 2)

Theorizations and debates on the Arctic resource boom or on the
geopolitical tensions rising in the region [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
generally [[oblivious to indigenous political
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}, institutions and articulations in the
region[. This [erasure takes]{.mark} the [colonial violence]{.mark}
underlying the relation between Arctic States and Arctic indigenous
peoples [out of sight, obscuring the **violent history of
expropriation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[underpinning]{.mark}]{.underline}
contemporary Arctic geopolitics and economic
[[development]{.underline}.]{.mark} Another effect of such perspectives
is the presentation of the Arctic as an "empty" space, devoid of people,
social dynamics and politics other than those developed and brought by
Westphalian States.3) [[This]{.mark} position [seeks to **justify State
interventions**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} "properly" [[seizing]{.mark}]{.underline}
emerging [[economic]{.underline}]{.mark} and strategic [[opportunities
-- with]{.underline}]{.mark} little to [[no regard for indigenous
cultures and subsistence in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, nor to the
already sensible effects of climate change in the region.

The present article seeks to frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a new
wave of Arctic settler colonialism. We argue that, although [projects
for [resource exploitation of the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} are
achieving unprecedented scale, they [[represent a continuity of the
colonial project]{.underline}]{.mark}, benefitting from the way previous
waves of colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the
relations between Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories.
Our discussion is focused on the impacts of colonialism over the
Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit homeland -- and the
impacts of colonialism over the relation between State, indigenous
peoples and Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a discussion of the Arctic
resource boom and the strategic and development projects emerging in the
Arctic policies of littoral states and their treatment of indigenous
issues amid economic and strategic pressures to carve out new extractive
enclaves in Arctic territories.

We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to
understand how the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American
populations and the importance of resource extraction shaped
contemporary Arctic spaces -- from baleen and whale oil to the gold rush
and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here is to
understand how this first moment of colonialism set up the conditions
for modern-day resource development projects. The discussion, then,
turns to [contemporary economic development projects in the
Arctic]{.underline}, understanding them as neo-extractivist enterprises
-- i.e., enterprises that rely heavily on resource development and
control over space in a late capitalist globalized economy. As such,
these projects represent a geographical expansion of extractive
frontiers in a global scale, seeking new resource reserves and to
reshape space to make them commercially viable. This [represents a new
wave of colonialism]{.underline} -- i.e., of attempts by state and
capital to enhance control over traditional indigenous territories --
[and a new wave of threats and attempts at dispossessing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} from their rights to their traditional
lands and livelihoods.

Old colonialisms: the colonial encounter in Inuit Nunaat

'Government, as such, was introduced when the whaling fleet came to the
Beaufort Sea, when the trappers came to the Canadian Arctic, and when
the Danes came to Greenland. Behind them came the Christian
missionaries, and behind them came those who "governed" us.'4)

In the field of International Studies, [[analyses of
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitics and economic [[development tend
to overlook]{.mark} the process of transformation of the
Arctic]{.underline} in a series of discrete territorial jurisdictions --
[and [the colonial violence underpinning such process]{.mark}
is]{.underline} generally [absent]{.underline} from historical
narratives and theoretical reflections. Since mainstream theorizations
organize their gaze from the point of view of the State, subnational and
non-national, non-state political organizations are rendered invisible.
Therefore, the colonization of Inuit Nunaat -- and, in fact, [the
colonization of]{.underline} the traditional homelands of [many
indigenous peoples are excluded from]{.underline} theoretical efforts
and reflections developed within [international relations]{.underline}
in general. [The recent spike in [interest in Arctic issues has
**reproduced such erasures**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [thinking
through]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[narrow definitions]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitics and [economic
[development,]{.mark}]{.underline} [seeing such issues so long as they
represent]{.underline} problems and/or [opportunities for Arctic
States.]{.underline} This framework has rendered Arctic international
relations into discussions and theorizing of Arctic interstate
relations, [[excluding indigenous political organizations
from]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[debates.]{.underline}]{.mark} An
account of the colonial encounter in Arctic spaces, more than a mere
historical recapitulation of how States occupied and annexed Inuit
Nunaat into their sovereign jurisdictions, is also a necessary step in
comprehending and theorizing contemporary Arctic environmental,
geopolitical and economic issues.

//DH

In the present text we focused on how Arctic colonialisms came to be and
the technologies they employed in the attempt of disarticulating Inuit
livelihoods, their social and cultural practices; this is not the only
history to be told. The Inuit -- and, in fact Indigenous peoples in the
Arctic and in the world -- have a long history of resistance to and
struggle against colonialism. [[The Inuit Circumpolar
Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is an institution born of such efforts and,
to this day, it [disputes the contents and objectives of Arctic policies

and Arctic policies in many dimensions[. [Rejecting]{.underline}]{.mark}

**other than those deployed by settler-colonial**]{.mark}, capitalist,

Understanding colonialisms and their development is an important step in
reckoning with the colonial violence underlying present-day rationales
for dealing with geopolitical and economic issues in the Arctic. It is
important to know and tell the histories of struggle and resistance to
colonialism, but [it is]{.underline} [also important to understand how
[the understandings deployed by indigenous
populations]{.mark}]{.underline} and their social and political practice
**[[might inform future debates on Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
geopolitics and economic [**[development]{.underline}**.]{.mark} While
[[such struggles put in question the **Euro-American
definitions**]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}, sovereignty and self-government,
they were also invested in the construction of alternative
understandings and alternative social practices. Unearthing such
understandings and their impact over present-day Arctic Indigenous
policies, as well as understanding how they can articulate alternative
visions of Arctic economic development is an urgent task.

Definition

Addressing Arctic human development requires defining both "Arctic" and
"human development." The Arctic has not generally been treated by
scientists (social, natural, or physical) as a distinct region worthy of
study on its own but rather has been studied as segments or ecosystems
which are part of nation-states or regional ecosystems. Political and
ecological concepts of an Arctic region comprising the Arctic sea and
the circumpolar Arctic and cutting across the boundaries of the eight
Arctic nations (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
Russia, and the USA) only received currency with the development of the
Arctic Council (1996) and the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program
(AMAP 1997). The publication of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment
(ACIA 2004, Arctic Climate Change Update, 2021) and the Arctic Human
Development Report (AHDR 2004, 2015) led to increased focus and research
on human development in the Circumpolar Arctic and adaptation of Arctic
residents to the widespread changes wrought by climate change, with
warming disproportionally affecting Arctic regions. The Arctic region is
often roughly defined as those areas north of the tree line, north of
the Arctic circle (66°, 33 s of latitude), or north of 60° of latitude[.
[Human development has been defined]{.underline}]{.mark} broadly by the
UNDP [[as]{.mark}]{.underline} follows: "Human development aims to
[enlarge people's freedoms to do and be what they value]{.underline} and
have reason to value. In practice, human development also empowers
people to engage actively in development on our shared planet. [It is
people-centered]{.underline}. At all levels of development, human
development focuses on essential freedoms: [[enabling people to
lead]{.mark} long and [healthy lives]{.mark}, to acquire knowledge, to
be able to enjoy a decent [standard of living and to shape their own
lives]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Alkire, 2010). This definition reflects the
Sen "capability" approach (Sen, 1989) and also incorporates various
dimensions of development that have been consistent throughout most
definitions and operationalizations of the concept of human development,
including health, education, material well-being, improved choices, and
participation in development. [[The Arctic Human Development
Reports]{.underline}]{.mark} (AHDR 2004, 2015) and the Arctic Social
Indicators reports (ASI, ASI II) (2010, 2015) [[identified six
dimensions of human development]{.mark} and the quality of life [of
residents in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} the last three of
which are uniquely relevant to Arctic people: [[health, material
well-being, education, cultural vitality, contact]{.mark} or closeness
[with nature, and fate-control]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A scientific assessment

[The AHDR]{.underline} constitutes an assessment rather than a report
intended to present original research. In this, it [resembles the
reports of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme]{.underline}
and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. [The essential goal is to
identify and synthesize existing knowledge in the interests of
presenting an integrated picture of human development in the
Arctic]{.underline}, including similarities and differences between the
Arctic and other parts of the countries whose northern areas make up the
Arctic. The practice of scientific assessment has become relatively
familiar in the natural sciences during the past 20 years (13). But
there is no parallel tradition of conducting scientific assessments in
the social sciences. Accordingly, [we envision the AHDR as
a]{.underline} contribution to the rise of scientific assessment in the
social sciences in general, as well as a [contribution to the work for
the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development Working Group]{.underline}.

1.3.5 Economic development

"[Economic Development" will refer to the process of improving the
material welfare of the majority of individuals in a specified area.
Material welfare must improve "consistently or substantially over long
periods of time]{.underline}. **[The time dimension is
important]{.underline}** [so as to distinguish between **development**
and **short-period booms**]{.underline} in the level of economic
activity" (Beckford 1975:78, quoted in Allahar 1995:56). [Economic
development may be expressed through improvements in education,
infrastructure, housing, and access to clean water and healthy
food]{.underline}. Economic development then is distinguished from
economic *growth* in that growth refers to an increase in a country's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and as such is not a reflection of the
material welfare of the majority. Allahar points out that "\[e[\]conomic
*growth*]{.underline} speaks to a situation in which per capita income
is rising. It [is to be distinguished from development in that a rise in
per capita income may occur simultaneously with the increasing material
impoverishment of significantly large groups of people in a given
\[area]{.underline}\]" (1995:56).

#### Defining development as human centered is essential to Indigenous participation in the Arctic

//DH

[[The term "development" appears in the]{.underline}]{.mark} title of
both this report and the [first [AHDR]{.mark}]{.underline} (AHDR, 2004).
[[There has been a paradigm shift in]{.mark} how [this concept]{.mark}
is operationalized and measured]{.underline}. Whether Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) can adequately assess development in a broader sense has
been discussed for quite some time. Globally, [considerable [attention
has been given to developing alternative measures for development
to]{.mark}]{.underline} supplement or even [[substitute GDP]{.mark}
because]{.underline} of concerns that [GDP is often
misleading]{.underline} when used to quantify subjective well-being,
quality of life or happiness. Within the last decades, [a large number
of initiatives have been launched to better grasp the complexity
embedded in the terms "individual wellbeing]{.underline}", "quality of
life" and "happiness". These initiatives include: the United Nations
Human Development Index (UN HDI, n.d.), the European Quality of Life
Index (Eurofound, 2012); the European System of Social Indicators
(GESIS, ZUMA) (ZSI, nd), the Happy Planet Index (HPI, 2014), the
Bhutanese "Gross National Happiness Index" (GNHI, 2014), the OECD Better
Life Index (OECD, n.d.), the so-called Sarkozy initiative that resulted
in a number of recommendations from a group of prominent scholars on
measuring human development (CMEPSP, n.d.), and most recently,
"Wellbeing and Policy" (O'Donnel et al., 2014).

The terms "subjective well-being", "quality of life" and "happiness"
increasingly appear in a variety of assessments, surveys and analyses in
the Arctic. Recent examples include the Arctic Human Development Report
(AHDR, 2004), the Arctic Social Indicators project (ASI, 2010; ASI,
2014), the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) (Andersen
and Poppel, 2002; Kruse et al., 2008; Poppel, 2014), chapters focusing
on well-being in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (Nuttall et al.,
2005), and in the Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic Report
(SWIPA) (Hovelsrud et al., 2011). This trend reflects discourses about
human development, not only in the Arctic, but also on a global scale in
both political and academic fora. [[In discussions related to Arctic
human development, this might be]{.mark} seen as an indication of [an
increasing demand from Indigenous]{.mark} and other [Arctic residents to
be acknowledged as **active participants in developing the
Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and not passive recipients of the
consequences of rapid social and economic changes.

### 2ac CI -- infrastructure

#### Infrastructure is the [most significant]{.underline} aspect of Arctic development

Peter A. **Sherwin,** 20**20** - Master's thesis in Cold Climate
Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology Faculty of
Engineering Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering "An
analysis of international, national and local literature and the
formulation of criteria, for the development of holistic sustainable
Arctic coastal infrastructure."
<https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2779486> //DH

Infrastructure development is seen to be intensifying across the Arctic
with increased development of coastal infrastructure in particular.
Examples include the extensive development of port infrastructure within
the Russian Federation for the export of natural resources and
facilitation of trans-Arctic shipping. Also, the development of Canadian
road infrastructure, such as that from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk, to connect
the heart of Canada to its Arctic coastline, and a principle port of the
Beaufort Sea.

[Infrastructure]{.underline} is important, for the fact that it [forms a
significant proportion of the wider built environment]{.underline},
where the built environment relates human development to nature. As
such, [infrastructure is a **key component of development in
general**]{.underline}, and it can either be used to facilitate a true
holistic sustainable form of development, or it can more easily
facilitate something less than that. Of infrastructure, [it is built
infrastructure in particular that is most at threat from Arctic
environmental changes, and built infrastructure that is of **greatest
importance** for]{.underline} the implementation of future
[development]{.underline} interests. Thus, it is built infrastructure
that is the primary focus of this investigation.

Built [infrastructure]{.underline} can be considered as a network of
built physical assets, and [includes physical systems such as roads,
railways, energy and power networks, and networks of standalone assets
such as airports, hospitals, and schools. Infrastructure development
then is the creation or enhancement of such assets,]{.underline} not for
the sake of enhancement itself, but for the betterment of humanity and
nature. Thus, although infrastructure is most often considered as a
physical network, it is also part of the social-ecological system, of
which the Arctic component is so sensitive. **[Arctic
infrastructure]{.underline}** therefore [necessitates consideration of
its development,]{.underline} both horizontally across national,
municipal, and local boundaries, and vertically between, politics,
science, and practice. Baring this in mind, this dissertation focuses on
identifying themes of critical importance for consideration for the
development of holistic sustainable Arctic built infrastructure.

### 2ac CI -- climate adaptation

#### Development means improving human needs -- this requires Arctic adaptation

Peter A. **Sherwin,** 20**20** - Master's thesis in Cold Climate
Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology Faculty of
Engineering Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering "An
analysis of international, national and local literature and the
formulation of criteria, for the development of holistic sustainable
Arctic coastal infrastructure."
<https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2779486> //DH

[Development at its core is 'the process in which]{.underline} someone
or [something grows or changes and becomes more advanced']{.underline}
(Cambridge University Press, 2020). The path of development is complex
and does not adhere to one set direction, rather it changes as a result
of its surroundings. In reference to built infrastructure, [the path of
development is influenced by the needs and limits imposed by people and
nature]{.underline}. A common path of development is that reflective of
human motivation. As established by Maslow (1943), human motivation is
the fulfilment of ones pre-potent needs. Initially this is food and
water for basic survival. However, as these needs are fulfilled higher
needs dominate, and humanity develops towards their fulfilment.
Fulfilment can represent itself in ways such as the reduction of
poverty, environmental degradation, and social strife. Fulfilment can
also however soon turn to greed and self-gratification in material
wealth and the pursuit of peak experiences.

Thus, [different areas of the world experience development differently,
and require different approaches for its implementation. The
Arctic]{.underline} for example [has a different development profile
from that of the global north or global south and requires different
considerations.]{.underline}

The majority of global development focus is currently on the global
south, as per the United Nations Agenda 2030 and sustainable development
goals (SDGs) (United Nations General Assembly, 2015), despite the
development agenda supposedly having applicability to and acceptance by
all countries. This raises the question of whether the current global
understanding of sustainable development is in fact holistic and
sustainable at all, when the global south is not the primary culprit of
self-gratification, or for the resultant transgression of natural limits
and biodiversity loss that is ultimately undermining humanities
existence.

[With]{.underline} an estimated US \$[1 trillion of Arctic
infrastructure investment identified over a 15 year period]{.underline}
post 2016 (Guggenheim Partners, 2016), [the need for a truly applicable
pan-Arctic understanding of holistic sustainable development is
clear.]{.underline} The Arctic however faces unique challenges, and thus
requires a bespoke guide outlining the questions that should be asked by
politicians, scientists, and engineers etc. when considering Arctic
infrastructure construction and adaptation.

Indeed. [the Arctic can be characterised by a need for
adaptation]{.underline}. Necessary adaptation of existing Arctic
infrastructure subject to environmental change, and adaptation of the
focus of infrastructure [to build Arctic resilience and community
well-being]{.underline}. There is a need for enhanced well-being in the
Arctic, for the fact that it is lacking. Resilience is required to
successfully weather the storm of increasing global interest in the
Arctic regions.

To understand the need for adaptation and resilience of Arctic built
infrastructure, it is important to remember that the Arctic is a
social-ecological system (The Arctic Resilience Action Framework Review
Committee, 2017). This dissertation therefore starts from scratch in
review of sustainable development to identify what is sustainability and
what is development. It explores the concept of development in relation
to people and nature, considers how the Arctic experiences development,
its unique challenges, and alternative considerations for future
development.

Few concepts are as contested as
['[development']{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} It [can have
economic, political, or social implications, but in most cases [connotes
progress or improvement]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

And then there is the concept of [['sustainable
development']{.underline}]{.mark}, which has [found substantial currency
in the Arctic region, even [consist]{.mark}ing [of one of the Arctic
Council's]{.mark} two [mandates]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It adds an
environmental caveat to the concept of development, contending that
progress only happens if there isn't a permanent environmental
cost]{.underline} to it.

Although [[Arctic governance]{.underline}]{.mark}, policy and social
science [[is overwhelmingly concerned with
development]{.underline}]{.mark}, it can be argued that the art and the
science of it is poorly understood, though not for lack of effort.
[Arctic development is hard: [tensions exist between industrial activity
and environmental protection]{.mark}]{.underline}[; [and
between]{.underline}]{.mark} [Western and Indigenous [perceptions of
quality of life]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Populations are]{.mark} sparse
and [remote, and]{.mark} so [difficult to provide public
services]{.mark} for. There is a widespread lack of labour and financial
capital, affecting investment and prosperity.
[Infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} -- roads, airports, ports,
broadband, housing and hospitals - [[is expensive]{.mark}, where it
exists at all]{.underline}. [[Southern]{.mark}]{.underline} or urban

**SES = Socio-ecological systems, italics in original**

Arctic sustainability research focuses on SESs, which is a unit of
analysis and a way of operationalizing concepts such as resilience,
adaptation, robustness, and thrivability (ARR, 2013, 2016). SES is an
intertwined system of natural and social phenomena and processes linked
by mutual dependencies and dynamic reciprocities. SESs are often
understood as being interconnected through ecosystem services that
explicitly mediate between social and natural subsystems. As such, there
is need to develop an Arctic-focused practice of sustainability. In this
book, we adopted a working definition proposed by the Arctic FRontiers
Of SusTainability: Resources, Societies, Environments and Development in
the Changing North (Arctic-FROST) research coordination network (Petrov,
2014). [[Developed over a five-year process involving **dozens of
scholars** and Arctic community]{.mark} members, [we understand
sustainable Arctic development to be "*development that improves the
health, well-being and security of Arctic communities*]{.mark} *and
residents [while conserving ecosystem structures]{.mark}, functions, and
resources*]{.underline}."

[[This **Arctic-specific definition**]{.underline}]{.mark} explicitly
[[engages "ecology]{.mark},]{.underline} socio-environmental [[justice,
and equity]{.mark}, while recognizing the need to live within the
supporting ecosystem's limits]{.underline}" (after Agyeman et al.,
2003). What's really exciting about this Arctic sustainability
definition is the sense that there may be a better way forward for
people in this region because of the really hard work that's been done
by and for multiple stakeholders in government, in academia, and by
local and Indigenous peoples from communities. In defining Arctic
sustainability, we maintain the multi-generational nature of this
concept. Too often sustainable development is reduced to ad hoc
activities to resolve immediate problems or to deciding how or when to
act instead of actually doing something. Although addressing emergencies
is part of sustainable development, keeping a long-term perspective and
working toward sustainability with multiple generations is crucial to
success. Here, it's important to remember that sustainable development
is a process and an outcome, and a focus on process rather than on a
(normative) outcome may be a more productive, action-oriented approach
(Petrov et al., 2017).

### 1ar -- sustainable development

#### Prefer our evidence -- it's the [mandate]{.underline} of the [Arctic Council]{.underline} -- making it the core of the topic

//DH

The Arctic Council is the only major intergovernmental initiative for
the Arctic involving all eight Arctic states. It has two primary
objectives. The first is to promote environmental protection and follows
from the work of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, an effort
begun by the same Arctic states in 1991 to address environmental issues
affecting the entire region and, in particular, to develop multilateral
responses to pollution in the Russian Arctic. [[The]{.mark} second
[objective of the Arctic Council concerns sustainable
development]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This relates to the economic
circumstances of the]{.underline}]{.mark} [indigenous [people]{.mark}
and other residents [of the Arctic in the context of preserving the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. To these ends, the Council has
endorsed a number of cooperative activities to be carried out primarily
through a series of subsidiary bodies.

#### The Arctic Council is the most predictable and topic-defining standard

**EBM = Ecosystem Based Management**

Other than EBM, there are many interpretations of holism,
sustainability, and sustainable development. As per development, this
dissertation studies the historical understanding of sustainable
development to extract the array of sustainability concepts, and thus
deduce what it means in the Arctic. However, [the fundamental
understanding of sustainability is 'The quality of being able to
continue over a period of time']{.underline} (Cambridge University
Press, 2020). Of the many sustainable development concepts, by far the
most commonly referenced definition, given its continued use, is that of
the World Commission on Environment and Development, (1987) report, 'Our
Common Future':

'[Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising]{.underline} the ability of [future
generations]{.underline} to meet their own needs'

[The Arctic Council]{.underline}, (2000), **[the premier top level
pan-Arctic intergovernmental forum]{.underline}** for Arctic
collaboration, utilises and [expands this definition to consider
economic, social and cultural and environmental aspects]{.underline}:

'Sustainable Development must meet the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
[Economic, social and cultural development are]{.underline}, along with
environmental protection, interdependent and mutually reinforcing
aspects of Sustainable Development and are [**all** part of the Council
s focus]{.underline} in this regard'.

The Arctic Council's understanding of sustainable development is thus
founded on the triple bottom line, or three pillars of sustainability
concept -- considering balanced economic, social and environmental
dimensions (Alhaddi, 2015). This dissertation studies the identified
sustainability concepts and asks if there is a better alternative for
the Arctic. Although the Arctic is far less developed than much of the
rest of the world, it also resides within some of the most developed
countries on the planet. As such, whilst the Arctic has fewer
limitations to development, such as social ideals of globalisation, it
boasts large resources for development, such as political and economic
strength. The arctic is therefore in a better position than much of the
world to capitalise on its uniqueness to establish a more enlightened
sustainable path to well-being.

#### Development means establishing economic systems in the Arctic without destroying the environment or culture

Although international society tends to see the Arctic through the
lenses of geopolitics and a new economic frontier, the development of
the Arctic Council provides us with a model or a good testing case for
achieving sustainable development and global governance. Sustainable
[[development requires meeting three major needs]{.underline}]{.mark} of
human society without depriving the future generations of their ability
to meet the same needs: [[economic, social and
environmental]{.underline}]{.mark}.19 [[Sustainable development **in the
context of the Arctic** is]{.underline}]{.mark} succinctly stated by O.
Young: That is, \"[[the establishment of economic systems capable of
maintaining themselves]{.mark} over time [without disrupting major
Arctic ecosystems or destroying]{.mark}]{.underline} the distinctive
[[cultures]{.mark} of the Arctic\'s permanent residents]{.underline}.

[Although environmental protection constitutes a necessary condition
for]{.underline} the achievement of [sustainable development in the
Arctic, it **is far from sufficient**]{.underline}. [What is needed to
complement environmental protection]{.underline} in this context [is a
program featuring]{.underline} more **[direct economic
initiatives]{.underline}**. No doubt, some of the most important of
these initiatives can and will be articulated and administered largely
within domestic political arenas. But there are opportunities in this
realm for international activities as well. To acquire a feel for these
opportunities, consider the following examples.

### 2ac CI -- political, economic, social change

#### Development means overcoming obstacles to political, social or economic change. This accounts for indigenous interests in [remote regions]{.underline} like the Arctic

Remoteness and Development

What have we meant by \"remote regions\" and their \"development\"? Most
of [the regions we have studied are remote geographically, economically,
and politically]{.underline}. They are distant from large, urban
industrial and political centers, and they are sparsely settled. [Most
of them contain Native or indigenous populations as well as non-Native
immigrants]{.underline}, and they have a mix of traditional and western
institutions. Typically, they have limited market economies, and they
are dependent on nature, resource exports, government transfers, and
subsistence activities. The costs of doing public and private business
are high, important decisions affecting these areas are made in distant
metropolitan centers. These remote regions lack both political autonomy
and economic self-sufficiency.

A significant implication of these characteristics is that most of the
researchers view remote regions as problem areas suffering from a
complex set of physical, economic, and political limits on their
security, welfare, and autonomy.

[Development]{.underline}, in this view, [is a process of overcoming
obstacles to desired forms of change]{.underline}. Different, often
conflicting [objectives for social, economic, and political change are
sought]{.underline} by organized interests within and outside the
region. Indigenous groups, for example, may give priority to renewable
resource and subsistence values, while immigrants to the region may
focus on the production and export of non-renewable resources. In such a
context, the [term \"development\" is often used to refer only to the
interests of immigrant groups, but this is **too narrow**]{.underline} a
use of the term. [Indigenous groups seek changes in disadvantageous
economic and political conditions]{.underline}. In this sense,
[indigenous groups also seek \"development.\" particularly the kind of
development that would give them greater control over their economic and
political fortunes]{.underline}.

§ 2461. Findings and purposes

\(a\) Findings. Congress finds that---

\(1\) the Antarctic continent with its associated and dependent
ecosystems is a distinctive environment providing a habitat for many
unique species and offering a natural laboratory from which to monitor
critical aspects of stratospheric ozone depletion and global climate
change;

\(2\) [Antarctica is protected by]{.underline} a series of international
agreements, including [the Antarctic Treaty]{.underline} and associated
recommendations, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals,
and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources, which are intended to conserve the renewable natural
resources of Antarctica and to recognize the importance of Antarctica
for the conduct of scientific research;

\(3\) recurring and recent developments in Antarctica, including
increased siting of scientific stations, poor waste disposal practices,
oil spills, increased tourism, and the over- exploitation of marine
living resources, have raised serious questions about the adequacy and
implementation of existing agreements and domestic law to protect the
Antarctic environment and its living marine resources;

\(4\) the parties to the Antarctic Treaty have negotiated a Convention
on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities which the
United States has signed but not yet ratified;

\(5\) the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources
Activities does not guarantee the preservation of the fragile
environment of Antarctica and could actually stimulate movement toward
Antarctic mineral resource activity;

\(6\) the exploitation of mineral resources in Antarctica could lead to
additional degradation of the Antarctic environment, including increased
risk of oil spills;

\(7\) [[the Antarctic Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark} Consultative Parties
have [[agreed to a ban on Antarctic mineral resource
activities]{.mark}]{.underline} which needs to be made legally binding;

\(8\) the level of scientific study, including necessary support
facilities, has increased to the point that some scientific programs may
be degrading the Antarctic environment; and

\(9\) the planned special consultative meeting of parties to the
Antarctic Treaty and the imminence of the thirtieth anniversary of the
Antarctic Treaty provide opportunities for the United States to exercise
leadership toward protection and sound management of Antarctica.

\(b\) Purpose. [[The purpose of this Act]{.underline}]{.mark} \[16 USCS

United States citizens and other persons subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States;

\(3\) urge other nations to join the United States in immediately
negotiating one or more new agreements to provide an indefinite ban on
all Antarctic mineral resource activities and comprehensive protection
for Antarctica and its associated and dependent ecosystems; and

\(4\) urge all nations to consider a permanent ban on Antarctic mineral
resource activities.

The Arctic region

Defining the Arctic

There is nothing intuitively obvious about the idea of treating the
Arctic as a distinct region. Unlike more familiar regions, such as
Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or South America, [the Arctic
consists]{.underline} largely [of segments of nation states whose
political centers of gravity lie]{.underline}, for the most part, far
[to the south]{.underline} (2). [This]{.underline} observation [presents
us with the problem of determining what [specific parts]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} these states to include in a region designated as [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} or the circumpolar North.

Even more troublesome is the fact that [this effort [requires]{.mark}
the application of [different geopolitical conventions]{.mark} in
individual sectors of the region]{.underline}. [[In the Canadian
Arctic]{.underline},]{.mark} for instance, [[it seems reasonable to
adopt]{.mark} [60°N]{.mark}]{.underline} as the southern boundary of the
region, a convention that separates the three northern territories from
the southern provinces (3). Yet [[applying the same convention to
Fennoscandia]{.mark} would demarcate a region running as far south as
Oslo and Helsinki]{.underline}, an outcome [that [makes]{.mark} [little
sense]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to those who think about Arctic issues in
the Nordic countries]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Of course, it is possible to resort to the use of [[biophysical criteria
to determine the]{.underline}]{.mark} extent of the
[[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} as a region. But aside from the fact that
this approach [[has little to recommend]{.mark} it [in cultural,
economic, or political terms]{.mark}, [it]{.mark} also [fails to produce
a clear cut result.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In practical terms, we have concluded that [[there is much to be
said]{.underline} [for bounding the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [in a
manner that is broadly **[compatible with studies of other Arctic
issues]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than adopting yet another approach
to determining the extent of the region. For this reason[, [the AHDR
takes]{.underline}]{.mark} [as its point of departure [the
region]{.mark} that [the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme
covers]{.mark} in its 1997 and 2002 reports]{.underline} (4-5). For
reasons having to do mainly with the location of jurisdictional or
administrative boundaries and the availability of data, however, the
area covered by this report differs from the AMAP Arctic in some
respects.

Thus, [[the AHDR Arctic encompasses **all of
Alaska**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [Canada North of 60°N]{.underline}
together with northern Quebec and Labrador, all of
[Greenland]{.underline}, the Faroe Islands, and [Iceland, and the
northernmost counties of Norway, Sweden and Finland]{.underline}. The
situation in Russia is harder to describe in simple terms. The area
included, as demarcated by our demographers, encompasses the Murmansk
Oblast, the Nenets, Yamalo- Nenets, Taimyr, and Chukotka autonomus
okrugs, Vorkuta City in the Komi Republic, Norilsk and Igsrka in
Krasnoyarsky Kray, and those parts of the Sakha Republic whose
boundaries lie closest to the Arctic Circle.,

This, then, is the AHDR Arctic. It encompasses an area of over 40
million square kilometers or about 8% of the surface of the Earth, a
sizable domain by any standards (4, 6). But the human residents of this
vast area number only about 4 million, of whom almost half are located
within the Russian Federation (4).

["The Arctic" can be defined differently, but the definition provided by

[follows]{.underline} those [definitions used in **standard Arctic

parts of Fenno-scandia, European Russia and Siberia,
[Alaska]{.underline}, Greenland, and Iceland. In Canada the region
consists primarily of the three territories, Nunavik, and Labrador. Due
to the similarity of conditions in some areas of the provincial norths,
communities in these regions are also sometimes discussed.

Arctic

Defining the extent of the Arctic is challenging given the many and
varied considerations of what the Arctic represents. Classically, the
Arctic can be considered as that area within the Arctic circle, the
latitude of 66° 33' 44" North, above which the sun can remain above or
below the horizon continuously for 24 hours. [The Arctic circle
definition is restrictive]{.underline} however [in that it does not
describe many of the environmental and geographical conditions normally
associated with the Arctic]{.underline}, such as temperature, the
presence of permafrost or fauna and flora prevalence. [Ignoring such
factors in the consideration of development of Arctic built
infrastructure is]{.underline} needless to say
[unsustainabl]{.underline}e. Although not all encompassing, [the
definition of the Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
Programme]{.underline} (Murray et al., 1998; AMAP, 2020) [considers
these aspects, and]{.underline} as presented in the below Figure 2-1,
largely also **[envelopes other common Arctic
definitions]{.underline}**. It is this AMAP definition of the Arctic,
more clearly shown in Figure 2-2, that is considered within this
assessment.
