**Ciolan, 22** - Research Fellow in the Europe in the World programme at
the European Policy Centre (Apr 11, 2022, Ionela Ciolan, "The EU's
geopolitical awakening in the Arctic,"

[The northern neighbourhood is one of the **main testing grounds for the
EU's geopolitical awakening**]{.underline}. [Only through skilful use of
diplomacy, deterrence, dialogue and defence will the EU successfully
**preserve the peace, sustainability and security of the
Arctic**.]{.underline}

Decades of exceptionalism, characterised by cooperation and peaceful
dialogue, branded the Arctic a "pole of peace". Today, it is fast
transforming into a 'pole of instability' as geopolitics return to the
High North and great power politics start to dominate this region. As
the Arctic becomes a space for geopolitical competition, sharpened by
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the battles will be carried out in five
areas: the chase for natural resources, the rivalry for supremacy, the
contest for trading routes, the race for tourism opportunities, and the
run for salvaging the environment of the Circumpolar North.

The EU's voice in the Arctic

The EU's engagement in the Arctic has been more ambitious in words than
practice. Comprised of eight states -- Canada, the US, Denmark, Iceland,
Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Russian Federation --, the Arctic Council
is the main framework of cooperation between the Arctic states and the
North indigenous peoples on issues of environmental protection and
sustainable development. For 21 years, the EU has been waiting for a
seat in the room as an observer in the Council. As such, its work in the
northern neighbourhood is dependent on the goodwill of the Arctic eight.

But things are changing. [The 2021 Arctic Strategy gives Brussels a
legitimate voice on Arctic issues and brakes its tiptoeing approach. By
focusing the strategy on climate action and acknowledging the region as
a strategic domain]{.underline} for European security in a growing
geopolitical contest, [the EU claims a rightful place within the Arctic
discussions]{.underline}. In addition, the strategic relevance of the
northern neighbourhood for the EU, along with the east and the south,
was confirmed by the recently published Strategic Compass for European
security and defence.

[Beyond having a voice, the **EU should now devise a better and more
comprehensive strategy toward the Arctic**]{.underline}. [The "new
normal" in the northern neighbourhood is characterised by multicrises
that will **require Brussels' strategic engagement**]{.underline},
especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

More permafrost melting, less climate security

After the Amazon, the Arctic is the world's second-biggest carbon sink,
and the global "refrigerator" as it regulates global temperatures. In
the High North, the effects of climate change are developing three times
faster than anywhere on the globe, with implications for oceanic,
atmospheric and geophysical developments.

As the Arctic heats up and more ice melts, cascading effects will
further climate insecurity: extreme weather events, biodiversity loss,
permafrost thawing with unimaginable consequences everywhere. Indeed,
the melting of the permafrost could act as a climate bomb, releasing a
billion tons of carbon gases into the atmosphere, awakening long-dormant
bacteria and microbes, and changing polar landscapes that will disrupt
local human activities and infrastructure.

The warming of the Circumpolar North also means competition for its vast
untapped resources. The Arctic land and ocean hold 13% and 30% of the
world's undiscovered oil and gas reserves, respectively. The region is
also rich in fish, natural minerals (e.g. nickel, platinum, palladium)
and rare-earth elements vital to modern technology and cutting-edge
innovations. Finally, it offers the possibility of shorter commercial
routes, which implies profits of billions of dollars.

And with this comes geo-economic and geopolitical rivalry, too.

Rising geopolitics in the High North

Climate change acts as a conflict and risk multiplier. And nowhere on
the globe are the geopolitical consequences of climate insecurity as
visible as in the European Arctic. For example, Scandinavia is at the
forefront of great power politics and growing competition between the
West and Russia.

In the past decades, the Kremlin revitalised its Northern Fleet by
constructing new Arctic military bases, complete with naval facilities,
radar and testing sites, airfields and missile storage facilities, to
phase "NATO out of Arctic". Russia has returned to a version of its Cold
War posture focused on securing its ballistic missile submarine fleet
and operations in the North Atlantic Ocean.

To make the Arctic picture more challenging for Brussels, China declared
itself a "near-Arctic state" in 2018 and is pursuing the creation of, in
cooperation with Russia, a global transport corridor within the Northern
Sea Route. It would be 40% faster than traditional cargo routes via the
Suez Canal.

Beijing's interests in the Arctic exceed pure economic, environmental
and energy interests towards military implications. In the last few
years, China has developed dual-use technology within its Arctic
research facilities to gain influence and a strategic position in the
High North. Increased military presence in the region reveals China's
ambition to become a "polar great power" by 2030.

Enter NATO

For years, NATO was adamant about creating an Arctic Strategy and let
its five northern members -- the US, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Denmark --
take the lead. Russia's aggressive actions since 2014 boosted NATO's
deterrence of its Northern Flank.

NATO's 2022 Cold Response exercise was the largest military drill in the
Arctic since the Cold War. Roughly 30,000 soldiers from 27 Allied
countries trained for a simulated attack on land, air and sea in the
Circumpolar North.

There is a growing security dilemma in the Arctic region, as both Russia
and NATO have intensified their military exercises and presence in the
area, heightening threat perceptions and lowering trust on both sides.
This situation is worsened by the lack of a framework for dialogue
between NATO and Russia on security and defence topics. The only two
existing security cooperation mechanisms, the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable and the Arctic Chiefs of Defence Staff meetings, were called
off or held without Russia since the latter's annexation of Crimea.

To make matters worse, Russia's war on Ukraine and challenge to the
European security architecture brings "a new normal \[\...\] for Arctic
security", characterised by even more competition and enhanced defence
and security risks for the Alliance. Now, even Sweden and Finland,
non-NATO Arctic states, are facing the Russian threat and moving closer
to NATO -- which the latter would gladly welcome.

Russia's war changes the Arctic

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a "watershed moment" that will define
the future of European security, with cascading effects on the Arctic.
Russia is threatening the international rules-based order, undermining
Europe's security architecture, and making the European Arctic the
'hottest' area in the High North.

In response to Russia's aggression, the seven other Arctic states
provisionally suspended their participation in the Arctic Council,
isolating Russia. The pausing of its intergovernmental working groups
was unprecedented, breaking with the tradition of keeping the Arctic out
of conflicting politics.

Indeed, halting the Arctic Council affects Arctic security, governance
and climate research directly. These effects will be felt across
regional projects on climate change, biodiversity, oil spills, resource
exploitations, search and rescue missions, and fishing. But, most
importantly, the downward effect of the Kremlin's breach of the
international norms marks the return of geopolitics in the Arctic.

How can the EU respond to the multicrises?

In this volatile and fragile environment, **[the EU's goal of becoming a
geopolitical player]{.underline}** [should be based on a 360°-security
approach, and readiness and resilience to respond to
permacrisis]{.underline}.

[The EU will have to respond to all crises -- climate insecurity, rising
geopolitics, instability, territorial issues, human security --
simultaneously and with equal strength and resolve]{.underline}. As
such, it will need to skilfully use four D's.

1.  Defence: Build an EU Arctic Security Strategy. The time for
    tiptoeing and appeasing is over. Brussels must become a security
    provider for the Nordics in the realms of climate and hybrid
    security to face the expanding Russian militarisation.

2.  Deterrence: Cooperate more strongly with NATO on Arctic security. In
    an era of permacrisis with a multitude of 'burning areas', only a
    deepened EU--NATO cooperation can preserve the security of the
    Euro-Atlantic space and deter the aggressive actions of other
    players.

3.  Dialogue: Start an Arctic 'seven + EU' framework dialogue on climate
    change. The Arctic Council must resume, even without Russia, as the
    unfolding negative effects of climate change do not wait or stop for
    political consensus.

4.  Diplomacy: Support the creation of a UN mechanism for the Arctic. As
    many non-Arctic countries direct their attention towards the region,
    a governance body for the High North will be needed to manage the
    ramifications of these newly found interests.

The new Arctic

After decades of peaceful cooperation, geopolitics is back in the
Circumpolar North -- and it is the European Arctic that feels the burn
of rising instability and competition. From climate insecurity to
increased militarisation and great power politics, this region will grow
in importance, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\
[The **unfolding multicrises of the European Arctic will test the EU's
responsiveness, ambition and preparedness**. It is time for the EU to go
one step further and act on its newly founded geopolitical voice by
employing]{.underline} the four D's -- [defence, deterrence, dialogue
and diplomacy -- in its Arctic outlook]{.underline}.

### 1nc EU Strategic Autonomy Net Benefit

#### Lack of U.S. commitment to Arctic [motivates European states]{.underline} to develop strong [independent]{.underline} security policies

**Thorsson, 25** (April 10, 2025, Elías Thorsson, "Can Europe defend the
Arctic without the U.S.?"
https://www.arctictoday.com/can-europe-defend-the-arctic-without-the-u-s/,
JMP))

With shifting power dynamics, rising geopolitical tensions and the
return of great-power competition in the High North, the question of
whether Europe could defend its own Arctic territory without American
support no longer feels hypothetical. [As the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [flirts with
isolationist rhetoric]{.underline}, threatens to take over allied
territories [and questions swirl around its long-term commitment to
NATO, many European leaders]{.underline} and military experts [are
reevaluating their own readiness---**particularly in the strategically
vital Arctic**]{.underline}.

[Retired U.S. Lieutenant General]{.underline} Ben [Hodges, former
commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, told]{.underline} Arctic Today
that more than a question resources, the [future of European defense was
political]{.underline}.

["Of course Europe is capable \[of defending itself\], but it has to
summon the political will,"]{.underline} he said. "Everybody knows
Russia is a bad guy. And for years I've been hearing we need to step up
without anybody stepping up."

Hodges claimed that [defending the European Arctic---especially
countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland---**without the**
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would be]{.underline}
difficult, but [not impossible]{.underline}.

"The military capabilities exist," he said. ["What lacks is not
capability, but political will.]{.underline} Nations like Norway are
wealthy enough to do much more, but have chosen not to. That's not a
resource problem---that's a choice."

He warned that the deterrent power of NATO, particularly Article 5, has
traditionally relied not just on its legal structure but on the
perception of unity and certainty. Hodges claims that the real danger
lies in the erosion of NATO's deterrent credibility.

"There never was a question about whether any country would live up to
\[Article 5\]... Now there's a question."

That doubt has grown exponentially in recent months. On February 17, at
the 2025 Munich Security Conference, U.S. vice president JD [Vance
openly questioned the sustainability of America's military role in
Europe, casting it as a strategic overreach]{.underline} incompatible
with U.S. domestic priorities. [Vance's remarks sent ripples through
European defense circles, reinforcing a sense that bipartisan consensus
in Washington on transatlantic security can **no longer be taken for
granted**]{.underline}.

New threats and new alliances

In terms of the threats facing the region, [Hodges' concern isn't only
about Russia]{.underline}'s overt aggression but [also about its hybrid
tactics---sabotage, cyberattacks and pressure on undersea
infrastructure]{.underline}. These tactics have already intensified in
the Arctic and the Baltic regions and could escalate if Moscow senses a
weakened or divided NATO.

Dr. Paal Sigurd Hilde, Professor of War Studies at the Norwegian Defence
University College, agrees that [the Arctic could become a serious
vulnerability for Europe if U.S. support fades.]{.underline} But he is
more cautious in his assessment of Europe's independent capabilities.

["Will European countries be able to defend Finland, Sweden and Norway
without U.S. support?]{.underline} In my eyes [yes, if the UK and
Germany and others contribute]{.underline}, but with much more
difficulty and greater losses," Hilde said.

However, he cautioned that defending remote and symbolically important
areas like Svalbard without American assistance would likely be beyond
Europe's current capacity.

Europe's readiness gaps are not just theoretical. Hilde pointed to
strategic airlift, long-range strike capability and intelligence assets
as areas where Europe remains heavily reliant on U.S. support. Even in
terms of basic infrastructure, he noted that road and rail connectivity
across Scandinavia remains insufficient for a high-speed military
response.

Nevertheless, Hodges believes **[the current geopolitical moment could
be a turning point]{.underline}**.

["It's a shame that **Europe needs the**]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to remind it to
live up to its treaty obligations]{.underline}**," he said, ["but **if
this is what it takes to get countries to finally act, then maybe it's
for the better** in the long term."]{.underline}

**[Signs of this shift are beginning to appear]{.underline}**. In early
2025, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom [and Norway announced plans for a new defense
agreement focused on the High North, aimed at enhancing joint
operations, intelligence-sharing, and protection of undersea
infrastructure]{.underline}. For Hodges, [the UK stands out as the
European country most likely to step into a greater leadership
role]{.underline}.

["There is more than enough combat power and potential in the
region,"]{.underline} he said. "The problem has always been coordination
and commitment."

When it comes to nuclear deterrence, both men agreed that France and the
UK are the only real options for Europe if the U.S. steps back, however,
how that nuclear umbrella would be implemented remains up in the air.

"How far the UK is willing to go alone in offering what is called
extended nuclear deterrence to the Northern European countries is not
clear," Hilde said. "France has talked about offering this to other
European countries, but as far as I know, not been clear on details of
what this will involve or how it would work. Few seem to be keen on
taking up the French idea."

Still, creating an effective European-led defense framework for the
Arctic remains a tall order. [Hilde]{.underline} doesn't believe that
existing regional alliances like Nordefco could evolve into a serious
substitute for NATO, but he [sees **potential in a broader Northern
European bloc**]{.underline}.

"My bet would be on the Northern European countries coming together in
some kind of 'mini-NATO' in the north... the Nordic countries, the
Baltic, Poland, Germany, BeNeLux and the United Kingdom," he said.

Ultimately, [the central question isn't whether Europe can defend the
Arctic without the U.S.---it's whether it will]{.underline}. For Hodges,
[the time to **stop hoping for guarantees and start building credible
alternatives is now**]{.underline}.

"Deterrence requires capability and credibility," he said. "The
credibility part comes from showing that you're serious."

#### Ambitious EU Arctic policy [spills over]{.underline} as a test case for EU [supranationalism]{.underline}

**EP = European Parliament, MEPs = Members of the European Parliament**

What role for the European Parliament?

Generally speaking, the EP's Arctic voices tend to yield more
controversies and are less coherent than policy statements issued by the
Commission/EEAS and the Council. Especially in the early years of the
EU's Arctic policy process, considerations from the European Parliament
and those of its Members have often raised eyebrows among Arctic
stakeholders -- be it the push for the infamous seal ban or discussions
on an Arctic Treaty and moratoria on hydrocarbon exploitation. Yet, the
EP has often pushed the EU's Arctic policy to move forward and for
example continuously called to develop a comprehensive Arctic
'strategy'.

[Raising its Arctic voice is of key importance to the EP]{.underline}.
On an individual level, [the Arctic]{.underline} and related matters of
combatting climate change or environmental and animal protection, [is
a]{.underline} relatively [low-hanging fruit for]{.underline} some [MEPs
to gain votes within their electorate]{.underline}. Moreover, as
knowledge on Arctic matters is rather limited, those MEPs are easily to
be considered opinion makers, offering an often-unique chance to
influence and define policy. On a broader level, the declaratory and
political nature of EP resolutions allows for its representatives to
take more ambitious, outspoken and at times controversial or
confrontational stances, as compared to other EU institutions. Thus, the
[continuous engagement with Arctic issues is]{.underline} not only
important for the European Parliament and some of its MEPs to
continuously re-define its regional voice, it is also [essential to
acknowledge the Union's normative and **decisional
supranationalism**.]{.underline} This relates in particular to the
Arctic, as its policy touches many aspects of both internal and external
relevance/competence for the EU.

Accordingly, one wonders if [the E]{.underline}P [could]{.underline} not
**[sow the seeds for a more ambitious geopolitical European
Union]{.underline}**, [using the Arctic as]{.underline} case study and
**[test ground]{.underline}** [to frame an EU-ropean narrative fit for
**tomorrow's power politics**]{.underline}? This would start with
specific discussions on Chinese localisation tactics in Greenland to the
EP asking the Commission/EEAS for a comprehensive security analysis of
the Arctic and ends with a future- and goal-oriented, honest assessment
of what the EU can and wants to achieve in the circumpolar North. There
are good reasons for the rather timid coverage of the security angle in
the last policy statements. Yet, [a policy that aims to fully integrate
all Arctic concerns should]{.underline} explicitly recognise the
strategic importance of the Arctic, examine the new geopolitical
realities and [present clear and ambitious EU-ropean goals]{.underline}
-- [despite this might giving rise to negative responses from Arctic
states]{.underline}.

As such, [the EU could]{.underline} also convincingly [tackle matters of
key importance, such as an Arctic-based selective engagement with
Russia]{.underline}. Could the European Arctic be an area where the EU
could seek talks with Russia based on its continuing northern
cross-border bond and a potential willingness on the part of Russia? The
peripheral Arctic might be the venue where the EU and Russia find common
ground again, not only improving their relationship but also promoting
Arctic stability. Using the Arctic as arena for renewed relations, or at
least talks thereof, might have positive spillover effects on other
areas of dispute. As such, the Conference of Arctic Parliamentarians and
the active engagement of the European Parliament might offer an
opportunity to promote and actively engage in related,
behind-the-door-talks? Given the current world situation and the EU's
Arctic history, this might be naïve, but a policy that separates
regional from systemic components, sustainable development and
environmental protection from questions of hard security, offers the
opportunity to delineate clear and ambitious goals for the EU's Arctic
involvement. The European Parliament could complement the other
institutions to adapt a more strategic mind-set and breaking down policy
silos, starting with the Arctic region.

Arctic Geopolitics the EU-ropean Way

[If the European Union aims to become a truly geopolitical Union it
needs to learn the language of power by translating its economic and
soft power into strategic leverage.]{.underline} In an Arctic context
this means, among others, a concrete understanding of the security
concerns (some) Member States have, the definition of strategic goals
and an assessment on how the Union's economic and soft power could
address and tackle future security challenges. [A security analysis of
the Arctic might also reveal the potential for the EU to be at the
forefront of developing new regional means of 'geopolitical
cooperation'. This could provide impetus to properly manage the growing
global interest in Arctic matters and **counteract emerging global
geopolitical competition**]{.underline} that also affects the Arctic.
Over the last ten years, [we have seen a European Union that has
fulfilled its Arctic commitments, from funding research to fostering
ocean governance, from supporting sustainable development to promoting
international cooperation]{.underline}. A European Union that seems to
be satisfied with its Arctic status quo. However, if change is indeed
inherent in any system, [we might also see a European Union that aims to
leave its Arctic comfort zone based on a geopolitical strategy the
EU-ropean way -- **if Arctic states like it or not**]{.underline}.

#### That preserves global multilateralism and solves every existential threat

Ernesto **Zedillo,** 20**24** --Director of the Yale Center for the
Study of Globalization, former president of Mexico, former Commissioner
on the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and
Disarmament "Reinforcing the multilateral system: Counting on Europe to
keep us from the brink" 10/15,
<https://theelders.org/news/reinforcing-multilateral-system-counting-europe-keep-us-brink>
//DH

[Let us think of]{.underline} the [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic, the
natural disasters caused by [climate change]{.underline}, the evident
[deterioration of]{.underline} our planet's [natural capital, the
financial crisis]{.underline} the financial crisis just two decades ago,
the [wars]{.underline} and other conflicts [that have caused
millions]{.underline} of people [to die]{.underline} or be displaced,
[and]{.underline} the absurd existence of [nuclear weapons,]{.underline}
which, far from being reduced, has worsened in recent years, to cite
just a few of the many examples.

[Despite the]{.underline} existence and [increase of global
risks,]{.underline} some of [which have already become existential for
humanity]{.underline} and the planet, [the multilateral
system]{.underline}, far from being strengthened, [seems to be very
close to collapse]{.underline}.

The [threats hanging over the multilateral system are
overwhelming]{.underline}: blatant violation of the essential norms of
international law by major powers; non-compliance and even repudiation
of international agreements and treaties; paralysis in decision-making
mechanisms to prevent and resolve armed conflicts, most notably within
the UN Security Council; the multiplication of war fronts as has not
occurred in many decades; systematic undermining---by omission or
commission---of multilateral institutions to the point of paralysis, as
is the case with the World Trade Organization; deliberate efforts by
some members to erode the effectiveness and credibility of international
institutions by some of their members; failure to adopt and implement
strategies and policies---even those recently agreed upon---to address
proven risks, such as pandemics; disregard for conventions and norms on
human rights; the formation of regional blocs that exacerbate high-risk
rivalries; fragmentation of the international trade system; and
indifference in addressing emerging risks, such as cyber threats.

Historians debate whether today\'s geopolitics resembles that of the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading up to World War I, or that
of the 1920s and 1930s, on the way to the Great Depression and World War
II, or whether it is something like that experienced during the \"Cold
War.\" Others go as far back as the Peloponnesian War and apply
Thucydides\' classic analysis. My answer when I have been part of that
discussion has been: "all of the above."

Among the circumstances that occurred in the past and are now present
again, [we should count]{.underline} the following: [multipolarity
displacing unipolarity, military rivalries between the alliances that
emerged]{.underline} from that multipolarity[, open confrontations
between the two greatest powers, exacerbated nationalisms]{.underline} -
hand in hand with increasing armies, deepening economic disparities --
both between nations and within them, [isolationism and]{.underline} [a
resurgence of protectionism]{.underline}, ideological competition,
'[modernisation\' of nuclear weapons]{.underline} instead of their
abolition; technological and economic disruption, and repudiation or at
least detachment from institutions and international law.

[In the]{.underline} disastrous [first half of the 20th century, they
caused the **two great world wars**]{.underline}. [They may cause the
third in our very own time]{.underline}, [with one major difference:
**it would be the last for humanity**]{.underline}. Any use of [nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, however limited it may be at the beginning,
**[would unleash a chain reaction]{.underline}**, where the [firing of
just a fraction of the existing arsenals would lead to the
**extermination of our species**]{.underline}. In a war with nuclear
weapons, no one wins, we all lose everything.

What can prevent not only nuclear holocaust, but also open up paths to
prosperity, justice, and peace in the world, and on that path
successfully face the global challenges \-- or as we economists say,
provide the global public goods \-- that concern this Forum?

To be frank, it is not anything different from what has been used in the
past. I make the point, recalling that when my admired friend, Graham
Allison of Harvard, populariser a few years ago of the Thucydides trap
as a theory of the China-United States rivalry, launched the
intellectual challenge of formulating proposals to free ourselves from
the consequences of such a dilemma, I allowed myself to tell him that
since the years of the great Greek historian, among other things, humans
developed such basic and useful tools as politics, diplomacy, and
international law, and shown that it is possible to apply them very
successfully, whilst also experiencing the consequences of ignoring
them. The real challenge is to make the powerful recognize that it is in
their own national interest to resort to these means of civilization and
avoid those of barbarism.

I insist, this is not about invoking ethical values, altruism, or
justice. It is simply about acknowledging how high the cost has been of
not using international institutions and rules to resolve disputes and
address common or global problems.

One cannot resist the temptation to refer to at least a couple of
calamitous examples from this century, so as not to look too far back in
the past.

Consider the human, economic and geopolitical costs of the US invasion
of Iraq that began in 2003, costs that would have been avoided if that
power had adhered to the process that was already being followed at the
UN Security Council to determine the dangerousness of Hussein\'s regime.
Three and a half trillion dollars in direct costs plus that of the
destruction caused in the invaded country, as well as more than half a
million lives lost, deep regional destabilization, and a dramatic loss
of US influence, marking the end of the brief period of unipolarity and
benevolent hegemony - as that nation was seen during the years
immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

And what about the crime perpetrated by Russia invading Ukraine -
without any justification for such brutal use of force and violation of
international law - with the human losses and destruction that it has
and will continue to cause. To calculate the direct cost of this war,
one must also think of trillions of dollars, the human lives sacrificed
nearing half a million, the immense value of the destruction caused, and
whatever happens, a less secure Russia, converted into a criminal state
completely outside international law and less respected than at any
previous time in its history. The damage and pain caused to Ukrainians
is already immense and simply irreparable. The cost incurred by other
countries is also colossal. None of this atrocity was necessary. Beyond
President Putin\'s fanciful imperial ambitions, any controversy, if it
really existed at all, could have been resolved peacefully through the
means of diplomacy and international law.

The essential question is: where do we start to avoid the disaster
looming over the planet's geopolitics?

One possibility is to pay attention to the Pact for the Future, approved
at the UN Summit just last September 22 by all member countries - except
seven led by Russia.

The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, stated that the Summit was
to move multilateralism away from the edge of the precipice where it now
seems to be. The agreed Pact contains at least an agenda - ambitious
under the current circumstances - to first preserve what remains of the
system and then strengthen it. It contains critical commitments for many
aspects of international cooperation, but those related to international
peace and security, as well as the revitalisation of the multilateral
system, are particularly important, addressing fundamental issues such
as the reform of the Security Council and nuclear disarmament.

Delivering is not the same as promising. It would be serious if the Pact
were to join the long list of commitments made by governments at
important summits, only to be forgotten as soon as they are over. A
special effort is needed to organise the provision of global public
goods solemnly agreed on September 22.

The challenge is that, given the absence of a global government with the
authority and capacity to regulate, enforce, and impose taxes to finance
them, action to initiate the provision of global public goods must be
voluntary. But given the resistance of nation states to share their
sovereignty and the temptation to let others pay, the voluntarism to
unleash that provision does not happen spontaneously. [Historically, it
has been necessary fo]{.underline}r a nation or [a small group of
nations, with an enlightened vision and a clear sense of responsibility,
to unleash the processes leading to the solution of the problems that
affect all humanity]{.underline}.

Who can play that role in our time?

In the past, the United States has done so, exercising the leadership it
built up both through the military and economic might it had after World
War II and its feverish activity in promoting the creation of the UN,
the Bretton Woods institutions, the GATT and many others during the
1940s and 1950s.

In the past two decades, the United States certainly seems interested in
preserving its preeminent power but equally engaged in weakening the
multilateral system \--that it largely built. Its behaviour fits into a
view that purports that during the period in which the hegemon\'s
supremacy is not threatened, it will be in its interest to support the
rules-based system, largely of its own construction, in order to
preserve and enhance its dominant position. But when this position is
threatened by the emergence of a new power---in this case China---the
hegemon may turn against the rules-based system and revert to one that
is based purely on power, to delay or even prevent the emerging power
from taking over the dominant position. This is a short-sighted view
because it is actually in the long-term interest of both the hegemon,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and]{.underline} the
emerging power, [China]{.underline}, to operate within a system with
rules that serve to contain the effect, intended or not, of the actions
of the adversary country, if that is a valid term. Be that as it may[,
neither]{.underline} of them [seems]{.underline} genuinely [interested
in effectively leading the defence of the multilateral system in the
immediate future; rather, they are concerned with the
opposite]{.underline}, [most notably the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates.

To put it bluntly, [the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [is the only benign power on the geostrategic
horizon up to the task, and one around which a coalition of middle
powers could be formed that would join the endeavour]{.underline} \--for
their own national interest\-- [such as Japan, the United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia]{.underline} [and]{.underline} at some point some
[developing countries]{.underline} with the possibility of becoming an
emerging powers. For the moment, I rule out India.

[The EU seems like a suitable candidate to **fill the void** left by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates for many reasons. [Its economic
power should be highlighted]{.underline} \--although this obviously
needs to be strengthened; [its proven normative capacity, starting with
its attachment to democratic values]{.underline}, respect for human
rights and the rule of law; [its solid]{.underline} \--by any
comparison\-- [institutional structure that has materialised into an
admirable supranational entity]{.underline} [that could]{.underline}
well be imitated in some of its features to [reinforce multilateral
governance]{.underline}; [and its proven commitment to agreements and
policies to address global challenges]{.underline}.

Of course, to assume this role, [the EU must overcome multiple
challenges, the most important of which is perhaps to achieve a new
balance in its relationship with the United States.]{.underline} It
could start by not imitating the latter's trade neo-protectionism and
helping to fix the damage done to the World Trade Organization by the
United States since the previous American administration and which has
not been repaired in any way by the current one; likewise, Europe should
not imitate the acute Sinophobia that afflicts the United States, which
will prove very costly for all involved. And, of course, it must take
the essential components of the Pact for the Future - in whose content
it had a great influence - and promote concrete initiatives for the
implementation of those components.

### Solves -- Development Aid

#### EU leads global development aid efforts to eradicate poverty and promote growth through effective policies.

Directorate General for International Partnerships (**DG INTPA), 22** -
the Commission department responsible for international development
policy (14 Feb 2022, Directorate General for International Partnerships,
"European development policy"
https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/european-development-policy_en,
RS)

[European development policy **fosters sustainable development** and
stability in developing countries, with the ultimate goal of eradicating
extreme poverty]{.underline}.

[Development assistance is one of the **pillars of the EU's external
action**]{.underline}, alongside foreign, security, and trade policies.
[The EU and its Member States are the leading provider of official
development assistance worldwide.]{.underline}

European development policy is based on the fundamental principles laid
out in European treaties, agreements, and strategies. [it implements
international objectives which the EU helped develop and committed to
achieve, such as the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development]{.underline}, defining 17 concrete Sustainable Development
Goals and reflected in our new European Consensus on Development.

[We also strive to make European development policy more coherent and
effective, in the face of the increasing challenges caused by conflicts
and climate change. Policy coherence for development allows us to
minimise contradictions and build synergies between different EU
policies that are likely to affect our partner countries. And by
focusing on effectiveness, we strive to reach better development results
with smarter and more targeted investments.]{.underline}

#### The E.U. has experience and capability to increase development assistance

Yuval **Reinfeild**, 20**24** - Ph.D. and an esteemed research fellow at
Ben Gurion University, law lecturer at Harry Radzyner Law School. His
research delves into the impact of the European Court of Justice and the
European law on the global arena (The European Union as a Normative
Power /JP)

Despite its apparent challenges and shortcomings, [the EU's development
policy remains relevant]{.underline} for developing countries. [The EU
played a successful role in the spread of soft power in many
sectors]{.underline} in South Asia. Hanns Maull introduced the concept
of civilian power in the application of foreign policy as non-military
conduct, which provides strong normative commitment. The following are
the indicators that determine civilian power: (1) the concept
characterises a persuasion of national economic interests through
external diplomacy and (2) interdependence could result in the creation
of models of governance that use influential tools to "affect the nature
of the nation state". Civilian power advocates for the influence of the
expertise influence of the state through its objectives of civilisation
in the international environment.1

The state's dimension must be based on "guaranteeing the rule of law,
prosperity, and legitimate governance". This kind of state "employs
non-military foreign policy instruments as an application core principle
of policy objectives" with a focus on "collective or cooperative
security and security values". Maull's civilian power is inherent in the
notion of rights that pursues universally recognised values such as "the
promotion of democracy and human rights".2

The EU has a similar trend and characteristics admired by the Treaty of
Rome, which is still part of common norms and values that apply in every
policy.

Similarly, Helene Sjursen mentioned that the view of the EU as a
relevant and important international actor has gained increasing
acceptance just because [the EU is the world's largest trading power and
a major donor of humanitarian and development aid.]{.underline} The EU
is being conceived as a "civilian" power. Sjursen characterises the EU
as more than a civilian power (does not have a military instrument) but
its better fit as a normative, civilising, or ethical power in the
international system. Although the author describes the EU as a power
based on a supranational structure and its international role.3
According to normative, civilising, or ethical power, there are mixed
versions of engagement observed in this study. For example, the EU has
engaged in South Asia at all three levels (1) political level dialogue
facility -- for example, EU-India Summit, ASEM, and bilateral dialogue;
(2) humanitarian assistance and development aid which has been discussed
in this study; and (3) civil society and educational institutional level
engagement. According to the Maull civilian power framework, [the EU has
all levels of foreign policy engagement]{.underline} in South Asia,
which is framed with civilian and normative characteristics. The EU's
policymaking process envisaged consensus-based decision-making that is a
public mandate or democratic control and a significant element of
civilian power.4

The EU's democracy assistance promotes democracy, the rule of law, good
governance, and human rights in South Asia. Consequently, the EU engages
CSOs and NGOs in the region to influence by also a civilian power
instrument through its external actions. The European Parliament
organises regular dialogue with SAARC and there is a special website
that keeps informing about bilateral talks and progress.5

Anna Michalski considered the EU to be the "civilian soft power" and
more than an instrument of the international organisation or regime. As
an external observer, the EU proved that it was time to establish a CFSP
along with its Member States that places national priorities just before
they shared "European objectives". The EU has implications for the
policy regime on "transnational negotiation and consensus-building
governed by institutional rules, values, and procedures". This is a
particular mix of conventional and European public instruments. In this
scenario, she added that "[the power of persuasion becomes an
existential requirement for the popular legitimacy and credibility of
the EU".]{.underline} The EU's "same community of values" make it a
normative component of the EU's values, norms, and principles based on
constitutional construction. This constitutes within the constraints of
the institutional and political structure of the EU and it's "the
backbone of the European foreign policy doctrine".6

However, external activities of the EU are inspired by its comparative
inability to persuade both interests, such as national and international
audiences. Likewise, there is the nature of its existence and vision of
the international order. Nye referred to three major dimensions of soft
power, such as culture, diplomacy, and image, as a source of attraction.
These are the nature of non-coercive features that "allow persuasion and
encouraging others to cooperate". The EU is one of the examples that is
associated with a common culture, values, foreign policy, and a unique
image, especially as a model of regional integration. The 2017 soft
power index indicators also showed that the EU is in the top ten
influential and most liked countries.7

The soft power discussion in this study (Chapters 1 and 2) addressed
that most of the literature referred to above measures soft power, which
is also applied in the EU case. The EU's development policy falls under
development diplomacy, which is a sub-unit of new diplomacy. According
to EU-START research, "the EU promotes international norms in a wide
range of reforms related to democracy, the market economy, and good
governance through its external policies with the application of earning
goals", which is classified as "transforming power".

The EU launched a RESPECT (Realising Europe's soft power in external
cooperation and trade) research project to "identify options and
opportunities to realise [the potential of the EU's soft
power]{.underline} in achieving the external policy goals established by
the Lisbon Treaty and the EU's trade and development strategy".9 The
RESPECT is an EU evaluation project to identify the best possible
achievement of soft power through its trade and development policy. The
project is funded under the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme.
This project has considered EU external policies as political economy
incentives and economic activities where **[development policy is one of
the important development strategies of soft power]{.underline}**.10
Even the European Parliament said that "the European Parliament's
democracy support activities are part of its 'soft-power' [approach to
international relations]{.underline}". The European Parliament has
become an influential dialogue partner with representatives of partner
countries, third countries, and international organisations.11 Likewise,
this [study]{.underline} also [found]{.underline} that [the]{.underline}
[European Parliament]{.underline} [emerged as an evolving diplomatic
role]{.underline} through its democratic support in EU external
relations. The EU is working with SAARC and countries in South Asia with
democracy support and election coordination groups where election
observation activities are a comprehensive approach. The EU has unique
capacity and know-how in several individual areas, [for
example]{.underline}, [development assistance, humanitarian aid, aid for
trade, climate aid, international trade, peacekeeping, and other
reconstruction]{.underline}. But it can also be seen as a "weak actor or
sometimes non-existing in the down-swing of international relations".
However, it provides "an easy target for external pressure or driving
national interests of the EU Member State".12 This study also found that
the EU external action is ultimately a broader framework and that it
supports an effective and comprehensive independent external policy. The
EU has always set clear interests for its external relations policies
incorporated with its values and principles. These values and principles
also corresponded to the external action policies of South Asian
countries. [The EU development policies]{.underline} are
[also]{.underline} under[pin]{.underline}ned by significant [soft
power]{.underline} [norms like peace, democracy, the rule of law,
respect for human rights, and equality with respect to
diversity.]{.underline}

#### EU development aid boosts EU soft power

Francisco **Lopez** 20**24**, (Francisco José López, 3 Sep 2024, working
at the EU policy think-tank Friends of Europe, Former Erasmus Mundus
scholar in EU-LAC relations, "Europe's soft power at risk: justifying
cooperation funding in an era of geoeconomic rivalry", friends of
europe,
https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/critical-thinking-europes-soft-power-at-risk-justifying-cooperation-funding-in-an-era-of-geoeconomic-rivalry/)//MC

The [EU's]{.underline} main [tool of geoeconomic influence is
trade]{.underline}. Investments -- although a member state competency --
is another key tool for advancing European economic interests worldwide.
Hence, it is no surprise that the [recent Global Gateway strategy
links]{.underline} aid, trade and [investments to]{.underline} harmonise
[and catalyse the EU's economic and perhaps political influence
worldwide.]{.underline}

For instance, [it is through]{.underline} the links between [cooperation
and trade]{.underline} policies [that the bloc influences regulation
compliance with partners outside the continent]{.underline}. This means
in practice, allowing the bloc to implement unpopular trade regulations
with partners. For instance, the controversial regulation on
deforestation-free trade (EUDR) is buying acceptance with multi-country
development cooperation programmes funded by the EU Commission.
[This]{.underline} regulation [serves the EU as a tool for climate
diplomacy]{.underline} and as a way to content European consumers,
besides acting as a control check on agricultural imports.

[Another use of development cooperation is by advancing investment
efforts overseas serving the EU's internal policy
objectives.]{.underline} The EU blended finance and guarantees schemes
provide a platform for EU public and private investors to invest in big
expensive projects that contribute to the delivery of EU policy. [A
funding platform for renewable hydrogen exports from Chile]{.underline},
a lithium value chain project in Argentina and [a solar energy project
in Morocco]{.underline} are some examples in which [the]{.underline}
[EU]{.underline} Commission and its member states [influence investors
to fund EU policy priorities]{.underline} such as the Critical Raw
Materials Act and REPowerEU. Future major projects will focus on the
Caspian Sea transport corridor and the resource-rich Copperbelt in
Southern Africa.

Whether the instrumentalisation of development cooperation is a good
strategy for development purposes is another discussion. When funds are
destined for projects serving the EU's economic interest, the most
pressing needs of partner countries may not be addressed. That is, if
the Global Gateway strategy focuses too narrowly on geoeconomics, the
euros invested in grants risk not complying with DAC's evaluation
criteria, which outlines the added value principles for aid and
cooperation projects.

Therefore, [EU cooperation should address both the geoeconomic interests
of the bloc while having a social and sustainable impact in the
communities]{.underline} intervened, which in Global Gateway projects
mostly comes from the boost of the local economies. In this way, it
should be feasible to frame development cooperation as needed by the EU
and the partner countries. But, how do politicians and citizens embark
on the development train?

The EU needs to position its cooperation efforts as a unique value-based
approach to geoeconomics cooperation

Renewed narratives, old tensions

The UN Summit of the Future and the Conference on Financing for
Development approach, yet in the Old Continent, it seems that gaining
momentum for increased development funding is becoming increasingly
challenging. Hence, [it will be key to frame]{.underline} and
communicate [cooperation efforts for what they are]{.underline}
nowadays: [a central element of the EU's soft power influence,
particularly as they serve as a connecting dot between trade, investment
and diplomacy.]{.underline}

Policymakers should be clear about using development cooperation to
advance EU economic interests abroad. Development cooperation is never
an interest-neutral game, although donor countries have not recognised
this in the past. It is time that the EU acknowledges its interests in
development cooperation projects, which should help legitimise
cooperation funds within the EU and allow for transparency with partner
countries.

On a more practical level, [the quest for soft power has
intensified]{.underline} in the last few decades, as [China is looking
outward to complement its trade strategy with hard infrastructure
investments]{.underline} through the Belt and Road Initiative.
Therefore, [the EU is left in a position where it has to
follow]{.underline} -- to some extent -- this very same strategy to be
able to have stronger influence abroad. Hence, [the Global Gateway can
be understood as the EU's strategic punch in this geoeconomics
battlefield.]{.underline}

The [EU needs to position]{.underline} its cooperation [efforts as
a]{.underline} unique value-based [approach to geoeconomics
cooperation]{.underline}, as EU cooperation tends to balance hard
infrastructure funds with grants to civil society and smaller projects.
Hence, [the EU]{.underline} and its member states [constitute the only
major global actors with a strategy for development cooperation that
involves both aid funding and strategic investments.]{.underline} EU
citizens need to understand that without cooperation funds, the EU's
global influence can be significantly diminished as other strategic
rivals already have a strong presence in partner countries. Diminishing
[cooperation]{.underline} funds may also influence trade relations,
which, together with aid [and public diplomacy]{.underline}, [constitute
the core of the EU's soft]{.underline} -- and perhaps only -- [power
overseas]{.underline}. Hence, the Commission and the European
international development sector need to step into the battlefield of
the public dialogue to strive. Because what foreign influence would the
EU have without its soft power?

and milestone during 2025.

Flagship projects are identified on a yearly basis and integrated in a
Global Gateway flagships list which includes 218 initiatives from
previous years, in this case 2023 and 2024. The flagship list is not
exhaustive in relation to all projects and activities under Global
Gateway, but aims to serve as a tool for [the EU]{.underline} and its
member states for strategic communication and visibility during the year
2025 in the EU's engagement with its partners. [Flagship projects
showcase concrete transformative projects and emphasise their tangible
impact and benefits to local communities]{.underline}. The inclusion of
projects from member states in the list does not guarantee EU financing
for those projects.

The selection is carried out in line with the Global Gateway governance
and taking into account the input from the Commission, the EEAS and the
member states. Once a project is included in the list, it remains a
flagship project until its completion. To support the continued accuracy
and relevance of the list, a review procedure has been introduced to
allow for streamlining projects identified as flagships in 2023 and
2024.

// CB

The EU's Arctic policy and its key challenges

As mentioned by the EEAS, [the EU's Arctic policy:]{.underline}

> *"aims to help preserve the Arctic as a region of peaceful
> cooperation, to slow the effects of climate change, and to support the
> sustainable development of Arctic regions to the benefit of Arctic
> communities, not least Indigenous Peoples, and future generations."*

This statement also [highlights the main priorities]{.underline} for the
EU in the Arctic: [preserving peaceful cooperation, slowing down climate
change, and supporting sustainable development]{.underline}. [The
European Green Deal constitutes the core of the EU's Arctic
aspirations]{.underline}, paired with the EU's sustainable blue economy
plans. [The EU thus harbors predominantly soft power priorities centred
around the climate and the environment and the Union does not mention
anything about a possible strategic presence.]{.underline} The furthest
the 2021 Joint Communication goes on this topic is to state that it will
develop "strategic foresight on emerging security challenges." [These
and all other mentions of the word 'security' are in the context of
climate concerns and the monitoring thereof and remain rather
general.]{.underline}

[Climate change continues to be the most pressing challenge in the
Arctic region]{.underline} as the repercussions of global warming are
most visible in the circumpolar region. [The strong climate focus of the
EU's Arctic]{.underline} [policy is therefore highly
timely]{.underline}. However, the war in Ukraine is increasingly posing
more and more challenges to engagement in the Arctic region. The
economic consequences of the war are, for example, impacting the
progress and priority position of the Green Deal, as well as the EU's
imports of minerals and energy. The EU is mainly occupied with resolving
its internal challenges for the time being as it needs to send a clear
signal to its citizens that their well-being prevails over the Union's
geopolitical aspirations. If it fails to do so, it would only further
fuel Euroscepticism and the rise of populist governments within member
states.

[The EU's Arctic policy addresses environmental issues in the European
and Circumpolar Arctic through three main channels: internal
regulations, climate research and funding, and international
cooperation.122 First, the EU exerts a direct influence on the European
Arctic through its legislation]{.underline} concerning the environment,
energy, and biodiversity. For instance, it has conservation frameworks
and directives to protect Arctic ecosystems, such as the Natura 2000
network and the Habitats and Birds directives. 123 Second, the EU
actively funds research to understand and combat issues like plastic
waste and air transport of microplastics in the Arctic.124 [Third, the
EU plays a role in international agreements related to Arctic
environmental matters,]{.underline} such as the 'Treaty of the High
Seas'.125 However, the EU's Arctic policy remains somewhat marginalized
in Brussels, with Arctic concerns considered peripheral.126

[The EU\'s environmental policy acquis, characterized by comprehensive
legislation and high standards, represents its most potent tool for
mitigating Arctic climate change.]{.underline} The European Green Deal,
European Climate Law, and 'Fit for 55' package are key components,
setting ambitious targets and introducing reforms to reduce emissions
and promote renewable energy.127 As [argued by Chuffart et al., "\[t\]he
main influence the EU has on the Arctic is not via its Arctic policy but
through the Union's general regulatory and policy
processes"]{.underline}. 128 Thus, the [EU can best mitigate Arctic
climate change through the effective implementation of its internal
commitments and legislation.]{.underline}

### Solves -- Climate / Indigenous 

#### EU is a climate leader that promotes the highest environmental standards and respects indigenous peoples

licensed Senior Engineer in China\'s professional qualification system.
Ms. Wang holds a Master\'s degree from Columbia University and a
Bachelor\'s degree from Tsinghua University, both in Architecture. "A
Comparative Study of the Official Use of Arctic Environmental Discourses
of China and the EU" The Arctic Institute, 9/15/2020,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/comparative-study-official-use-arctic-environmental-discourses-china-eu//AH

Besides the aforementioned similarities, there are also some differences
in China and the EU's attitudinal resources. First of all, their
attitudes/stances have different chronological features. The frequency
of attitudinal resources in China's Arctic environmental discourses has
been continuously rising in general, especially from 2016, reaching a
peak in 2018 when China issued its first white paper on Arctic policy.
It reflects that China has an increasing interest in the Arctic and that
Arctic climate change and associated Arctic affairs are gradually
entering China's political agenda, particularly since 2016. [Compared to
China,]{.underline} [the distribution of the EU's attitudinal resources
is more balanced]{.underline} despite periodic fluctuations following
the updating of its Arctic policy in 2012 and 2016. This reveals [that
the EU has formulated its own attitudes/stances]{.underline} since its
2008 Arctic policy and has kept developing its attitudes/stances
regularly. In this sense, it could be argued that [the EU has more
mature attitudes/stances towards the Arctic, which could better guide
its current and upcoming Arctic participation]{.underline}

Second, [the EU pays more attention to making positive self-judgements
in its Arctic environmental discourse]{.underline}s. In some cases, [the
EU prefers to position itself as a 'leader', especially in the Arctic
climate change governance and Arctic research, while China never makes
similar judgements in its Arctic environmental discourses]{.underline}.
One reason could be that the [EU, as a normative power, is generally
assumed to be a leader in international climate change
governance,]{.underline}30) although such leadership has been weakened
to some extent since the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009.
Thus, despite being a non-Arctic actor, the [EU might believe that its
leadership can also be applied to Arctic climate change
governance]{.underline}. Comparatively, [China seems to be keeping a
circumspect stance]{.underline} toward international politics, at least
in its official discourses. Since most of the main players in the Arctic
are Western countries and the members of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), China, being a non-Arctic actor and an emerging
non-Western world power, has to be careful in navigating its Arctic
participation.

Third, there is a difference in how the judgement by other actors is
used as an attitudinal resource. This kind of judgement plays a role in
China's attitudinal resources, while it is rarely witnessed in EU
attitudes/stances. One possible reason could be their different
discursive styles. In Chinese official discourses, it is common to cite
Chinese ancient classical texts31) and to quote other international
actors' official discourse as well as their mainstream media reports,
including the judgements on China they made. In its Arctic environmental
discourses, China often cites the Arctic states' recognition of and
support for its participation in the Arctic, such as "a vital
participant in Arctic affairs"32) made by the Former President of
Iceland Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, "a precious partner for Finland and
other Nordic states"33) made by the Former Speaker of the Parliament of
Finland Maria Lohela, and "an active and constructive contributor to the
Arctic"34) made by the Deputy Director of Communication to the Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Canada Adam Austen. This seems to be adopted as a
strategy to support its positive attitudes/stances towards relevant
Arctic affairs.

Lastly, [compared to China, the proportion of 'desiderative feeling' in
the attitudinal resources is much higher for the EU. It indicates that
the EU prefers to clearly reiterate its participation willingness in its
Arctic environmental discourses.]{.underline} Some of the EU's Arctic
participation plans appear more ambitious. For example, the [EU is eager
to pursue the **highest safety and environment standards** in the
Arctic]{.underline} and has been trying to call on all Arctic
stakeholders to carry them out, which may again be motivated by its role
as a normative power in the international community.

Comparison of the Justification

When justifying their Arctic participation in Arctic environmental
discourses, both China and the EU focus on articulating the high
'reliability' and the key 'contribution' of their participation. This
corresponds to the emphasis on the positive self-judgement in their
attitudinal resources: China and the EU, as non-Arctic actors, are
trying to establish a similar positive self-image in the Arctic, namely,
as a reliable actor contributing to the protection and development of
the Arctic. It also seems that both actors desire to dispel doubts from
the Arctic states about the real intentions of their Arctic
participation and want their participation to be welcomed.

In order to prove their 'reliability', on the one hand, [China and the
EU frequently reiterate the **priority of Arctic environmental
protection** and Arctic climate change mitigation, the respect for
Arctic states and other stakeholders, the willingness to cooperate with
these actors, the contribution they have made/are making/can make, and
the importance of promoting sustainable development]{.underline}. On the
other hand, both have different preferences to articulate their
reliability. China pays more attention to underlining its
non-interventional position, its full respect for the jurisdiction,
sovereign rights and interest-seeking of Arctic states, and the pursuit
of common interests and win-win results with Arctic states. Such a
cautious strategy might be partly the result of its anxiety towards the
possible surfacing of the 'China threat' narratives in this context.35)

[Unlike China, it seems that the EU prefers to highlight its **respect
for and contribution to the Arctic Indigenous peoples** and
communities.]{.underline} One reason could be that there are Arctic
Indigenous people residing within the EU.36) More importantly, [its
emphasis on the rights of Indigenous communities represents one of its
core norms -- 'respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms]{.underline}' -- based on the norms identified from the laws
and policies of the EU.37)

Concerning their 'contribution', both actors highlight their efforts and
contributions to the protection and sustainable development of the
Arctic. The Arctic research contribution is commonly reiterated, but the
specific foci are different. The EU focuses on the vast amount of
funding it has offered to Arctic research, while China underlines the
significance of its ongoing Arctic research without revealing the actual
amount of funding it invests in Arctic research.38) Another difference
is that the [EU highlights its leading role in certain Arctic affairs
while China does not.]{.underline} The possible reason could be their
distinct roles and situations in the international community, which is
similar to the reason for some differences in the self-judgement of
attitudinal resources, see 'comparison of attitudinal resources' above).

Moreover, the legitimacy of participation plays an indispensable role in
justifying Arctic participation for both actors, and the participation
rights endowed by relevant international law and international treaties
are commonly highlighted. However, China and the EU have more distinct
foci when trying to establish the legitimacy of their Arctic
participation. China frequently mentions its observer status in the main
Arctic governance regime -- the Arctic Council (AC), while the EU seldom
mentions its status in the AC. The decision concerning the EU's observer
status was deferred at the Kiruna Ministerial Meeting in 2013, even
though the AC "receive\[d\] the application of the EU for Observer
status affirmatively" and the EU "may observe Council proceedings"
before a final decision.39) This is also why the EU often highlights its
eagerness to become a formal observer in the AC in its attitudinal
resources. Nonetheless, the EU has three Arctic Member States, which
means that the EU can participate in certain Arctic affairs on behalf of
its Arctic Member States, by means of the exclusive Union competences
and the shared Union competences.40) This fact is frequently mentioned
by the EU to justify its legitimacy. In addition, both actors have
different preferences for other categories of justification. China
emphasises the transregional and global nature of the Arctic environment
and relevant Arctic affairs to support the reasonability of its
participation, and the urgency of participation as a stakeholder.
Specifically, China sometimes pinpoints that its domestic climate,
ecological system, and even its agriculture are being negatively
affected by Arctic climate change because it is a "Near Arctic
actor".41) The EU takes into account the global nature and the urgency
of participation as well, but it does not pay as much attention as
China. In contrast, the EU highlights its responsibility to participate
in Arctic environmental affairs from time to time by admitting the
environmental footprint it has left in the Arctic.

Conclusion

Overall, this article argues that China and the EU share a series of
similarities and differences in the attitudinal and justification
resources of their Arctic environmental discourses. On the one hand, the
identified similarities generally depend on shared identities. For
example, both China and the EU seldom express the feeling of security
while they often speak highly of multiple governance regimes and
highlight their respect for the role and the rights of Arctic states.
This may be influenced by their collective identity, being key
non-Arctic actors, which requires them to make efforts to decrease
potential resistance to their Arctic participation from Arctic states.
Both actors also have a strong need to justify their Arctic
participation comprehensively, including the necessity of participation
that is hardly present in Arctic states' discourses.

On the other hand, the identified differences reflect their own distinct
features. For instance, China particularly emphasises its full respect
for the rights of Arctic states in order to justify its reliability and
to some extent relies on the recognition from the international
community to support its positive self-image. It reflects the
circumspect position of China as a rising non-Western and non-Arctic
country, as well as China's cultural and diplomatic tradition. [Unlike
China, the EU assumes itself as a normative power and tries to occupy
the moral and normative high ground in international affairs. The EU
particularly highlights its willingness and efforts to pursue its
proposed highest environmental standards in the Arctic, in order to
occupy a vital or even **leading role in Arctic climate governance** and
justify the importance of its Arctic participation.]{.underline} To some
extent, it could be argued that the underlying purpose of the various
official use of actors' Arctic environmental discourses is to serve
their own domestic interests in the Arctic.

Originally an economic integration project, [the EU has progressively
incorporated environmental issues into its treaties]{.underline}. The
1993 Maastricht Treaty contained "respecting the environment" as a task
of the Union.103 This treaty also established the 'precautionary
principle'. The 1999 [Amsterdam Treaty introduced the concept of
'environmental policy integration', emphasizing the mainstreaming of
environmental issues across various policy areas, such as transport,
energy, research, and fisheries.]{.underline} However, [the most
substantial progress came with the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, which enshrined
the EU\'s commitment to "a high level of protection and improvement of
the quality of the environment"]{.underline} in Article 3(3) TEU (Treaty
on European Union).104 The EU's environmental policy is articulated in
Art. 191(1) TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) and
includes objectives such as preserving and improving the environment\'s
quality, protecting human health, a rational use of natural resources,
and addressing global environmental issues like climate change.105 This
policy and its acquis largely extend to the countries of the European
Free Trade Association (EFTA) which are part of the EEA, like Norway and
Iceland.106

Energy policy also gained recognition with the Maastricht Treaty. 107
The Lisbon Treaty further established energy as a shared competence,
outlining objectives related to energy market functioning, supply
security, energy efficiency, and renewables. 108 However, EU energy
policy has notable limitations. EU member states maintain the authority
to determine their energy mix, as articulated in Article 194(2) TFEU.
109 This means that individual nations have the freedom to choose
between different energy sources and define their overall energy supply
structure.110 Additionally, EU mechanisms related to energy policy
generally do not extend to the EEA, which implies that the EU\'s
influence over the energy activities of countries like Iceland and
Norway remains limited.111 [Overall, the EU holds stronger legal
competence on environmental and climate change issues]{.underline} than
it does regarding energy policy.

[Building on these key environmental treaty provisions, the EU has
adopted a predominantly green discourse across its Arctic policy
documents.]{.underline} In the 2008 Commission Communication, the
emphasis was on preventing and mitigating climate change.112 The 2012
Joint Communication continued this trend with a focus on knowledge,
responsibility, and engagement, giving considerable attention to
environmental challenges.113 [By 2016, climate change and safeguarding
the Arctic environment had become a priority, with the need to advance
ocean governance and preserve biodiversity.114 In the 2021 Joint
Communication, resilience to climate change and environmental
degradation took center stage, along with recognizing the potential for
renewables in the Arctic.]{.underline} 115 The European Parliament also
championed this green discourse, calling for leadership in preventing
unregulated fishing in the Arctic and endorsing a precautionary approach
to fisheries.116

The EU's green discourse on Arctic policy has recently shifted from
circumventing politicized policy choices (before 2021) to adopting a
stronger, less equivocal position on the 'Arctic paradox' (since 2021).
According to Schunz et al., the EU's aggregate Arctic policy used to be
characterized as 'green by omission': "green rhetoric abounds in its
2016 Joint Communication because this latter ostensibly avoids
controversial issues".117 The extraction of hydrocarbons and minerals,
as well as sealing and whaling, were not addressed in the 2012 and 2016
documents.118 Moreover, Stępień and Koivurova pointed out that "tensions
between different objectives and values are obscured by labelling
developments, technologies, actions or desired outcomes as sustainable,
responsible or resilient, without providing details on the
contextualized meaning of these words".119

However, the most recent Arctic policy documents released in 2021
indicated a significant step towards developing a genuinely
environmentally oriented Arctic policy. The European Parliament's 2021
Resolution explicitly discouraged "the exploitation of Arctic resources
if it is scientifically proven to cause irreparable damage to the
ecosystem of the Arctic and beyond".120 Shortly thereafter, the Joint
Communication stated that the EU would be "pushing for oil, coal, and
gas to stay in the ground, including in Arctic regions".121 In short,
[the EU recently embraced more ambitious and transparent objectives in
the realm of Arctic environmental protection.]{.underline}

#### EU can cooperate with Russia to protect environment and help achieve geopolitical objectives

Unlike in the case of the energy sector, environmental interdependence
between the EU and Russia is less evident, but not less relevant. In
this case, [EU--Russia interdependence is mainly due to two
factors]{.underline}. [First]{.underline}, the [economic
activities]{.underline} (e.g. industries) [of the EU and Russia have
shared environmental consequences in the Arctic as environmental issues
are transboundary]{.underline}. This is why the EU--Russia environmental
interdependence is more symmetrical than in the case of the energy
sector. The EU, which is the northernmost industrial region close to the
Arctic, contributes to Arctic warming by producing 8% of the global
greenhouse gas emissions (Koivurova et al., 2019: 5). It is also
responsible for about 36% of Arctic deposition of black carbon and a
considerable source of marine litter (Koivurova et al., 2019: 5).
Russia, which is the world's fourth largest emitter (Digges, 2021;
Crippa et al., 2021), produces 5% of the world's carbon (Hill, 2021) and
is a big polluter in the Arctic. Second, bilaterally the EU and Russia
have been cooperating on environmental questions since 1995 (European
Commission, 2021c). [The EU has supported several projects aimed at
improving environmental standards in Russia]{.underline} (European
Commission, 2021c). [In 2006, the EU and Russia launched an
Environmental Dialogue, which is conducted every year by the EU DG
Environment and the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and
Ecology]{.underline} (European Commission, 2021c; Permanent Mission of
the Russian Federation to the European Union, 2016). However, the EU
Environmental Dialogue is currently frozen because of the Ukrainian case
(European Commission, 2021c). Multilaterally, [the EU and Russia
cooperate through multilateral environmental agreements]{.underline}
(MEAs). Examples are the Paris Agreement (2015) and the Kyoto Protocol
(1997), aimed at reducing greenhouse gases emissions. Although MEAs do
not address the Arctic directly, they apply to it. Additionally, [the EU
and Russia cooperate within the Northern Dimension Environmental
Partnership]{.underline} (NDEP), which is "a result-focused initiative
responding to calls from the international community, in particular
Russia and Belarus, for concerted action to tackle the most pressing
environmental problems in the Northern Dimension area -- a broad area
around the Barents and Baltic seas" (European Commission, 2021c). Like
the EU--Russia Environmental Dialogue, the NDEP is also paused and under
threat in the long term (Raspotnik et al., 2022). Additionally, the [EU
and Russia cooperate within the Arctic Council]{.underline} (AC) of
which Russia is a fullfledged member while the EU is an ad hoc observer.
Environment is a key sector of cooperation in the AC, the leading
intergovernmental forum guiding cooperation in the region. The EU
finances some activities of the AC. For instance, it funds the Action on
Black Carbon in the Arctic, which is an initiative aiming to "contribute
to the development of collective responses to reduce black carbon
emissions in the Arctic and to reinforce international cooperation to
protect the Arctic environment. It provides and communicates knowledge
about sources and emissions of black carbon and supports relevant
international policy processes" (AMAP, 2022). Also, the EU Arctic
Yearbook 2022 The Arctic as a laboratory for improving the relations
between the EU and Russia 9 [and Russia cooperate on the environment
within the Barents Euro-- Arctic Council]{.underline} (BEAC) as well. In
this case, [both the EU]{.underline} (through the Commission) [and
Russia are members]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the AC's and BEAC's
activities are currently suspended because of the war in Ukraine. As
[the EU and Russia are important actors in the environmental
decision-making processes globally, cooperation in the Arctic in this
sector is in the interest of both of them for two reasons]{.underline}.
First, [the Arctic is one of the world's most sensitive regions to
pollution]{.underline}. It is [warming four times as fast as the rest of
the world]{.underline} (Harvey, 2022) with consequences for the whole
earth as the Arctic helps to regulate its temperature. Second, **[by
cooperating to protect the Arctic environment, the EU and Russia could
pursue their geopolitical objectives more efficiently]{.underline}**.
While [the EU could be more deeply involved in the Arctic affairs,
Russia could exploit the environmental cooperation with the EU to be
considered a 'Great Ecological Power']{.underline}, as mentioned in the
previous section. Thus, [the EU could take advantage of its leading
position in environmental issues internationally by profitably
exploiting its expertise in the protection of the Arctic environment
especially through the implementation of the Green Deal]{.underline}.
This latter is at the core of its engagement in the region, as it is
explicitly stated in the Arctic Policy of 2021 (European Commission,
2021a). Indeed, the protection of the environment is the driving force
behind the EU's policy towards the region (Pieper et al., 2011: 234).
Russia is also an important actor in global environmental politics
(Martus, 2021: 870). Indeed, as it is one of the world's largest
contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, Russia's role in climate
change politics is significant (Martus, 2021: 870). For instance, its
ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in 2004 was key to bring the
agreement into force (Martus, 2021: 870; Tynkkynen & Tynkkynen, 2018:
1103). Very interestingly, Russia's decision to ratify the agreement was
dictated by political and economic incentives as in exchange for
ratification the EU ensured its support for Russian membership in the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) (Tynkkynen, 2010: 1103). However,
although political and economic incentives play a role, participation in
MEAs are of utmost strategic importance to Russia to be considered a
great power internationally. Therefore, [reinvigorating and
strengthening the EU--Russia environmental cooperation both bilaterally
through the Environmental Dialogue and multilaterally through a deeper
involvement of the EU in the AC activities]{.underline} -- the signpost
-- [would be a valuable strategy to achieve the endpoint]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, the path to follow would not be without obstacles. In
particular, the tensions due to the war in Ukraine and the consequent
sanctions imposed by the EU and the west would cause reciprocal mistrust
that might lead to misunderstandings making cooperation unlikely. In
order [to overcome]{.underline} these [obstacles]{.underline}, the
[actions required would consist in intensifying the number of the
Environmental Dialogue yearly meetings in order to increase the exchange
and share of information]{.underline}. For instance, scientific data,
best practices and lessons learned can be shared in order to more
effectively work to protect the Arctic environment while strengthening
cooperation at the same time. This would be very important for both the
EU and Russia. [Cooperation would be valuable for the EU as it could
access scientific data about the Arctic environment most of which are
available in the Russian territory]{.underline} that is the largest
state with the longest coast in the Arctic. [At the same time, Russia
could take advantage of the expertise and the experience of the EU in
the sector in order to apply more advanced methods and technology to
protect the environment, which the EU owns]{.underline}. The need to
clean up environmental damage with the Arctic is considered crucial and
was mentioned as a priority by President Vladimir Putin in his speech to
the Duma already in Arctic Yearbook 2022 Melchiorre 10 2012 (President
of Russia, 2012; Martus, 2021: 876). In 2014, Putin stressed the need
for the best technology policy as part of the government's effort to
introduce stringent environmental standards (President of Russia, 2012;
Martus, 2021: 876). Furthermore, another important action would consist
of making more stringent the measures that energy companies should adopt
in order to protect the Arctic environment. The EU legislation has
already established high environmental standards that energy companies
are obliged to respect (European Commission, 2021b). Although Russia
does not have the EU high environmental standards, it has been paying
more attention to the environmental issues since the 1990s. For
instance, in 2006, Putin identified energy efficiency "as a primary
concern for Russia's environmental security, indicating that
environmental reforms are closely linked to the broader modernization
agenda" (Martus, 2021: 876). Therefore, cooperation with the EU would be
very useful for Russia to adopt more effective measures and technologies
to protect the environment in its Arctic territories. Thus, in the new
Arctic scenario of 2050 the EU and Russia would actively cooperate to
protect the Arctic environment. They would establish close ties based on
regular meetings aiming at exchanging knowledge and competences. In
doing so, the EU and Russia would follow a common way to face the
challenges to the Arctic environment and to fight against climate
change. [The current channels of cooperation, both bilateral and
multilateral, namely the Environmental Dialogue, the AC, the BEAC and
the NDEP, would be reinforced and reinvigorated.]{.underline} Also,
given the environmental risks of extracting oil and gas in the Arctic[,
a strengthened cooperation between EU and Russian energy companies on
the basis of more stringent environmental rules would make their
commitment to the protection of the Arctic environment stronger and more
effective.]{.underline} This would encourage the western non -- EU
energy companies to cooperate with the Russian ones. In this context,
geography would play a key role. Indeed, although Russia would keep
close relations with China especially in the energy sector, [the
proximity between the EU and Russia would make them irreplaceable
partners in environmental cooperation]{.underline}. Additionally, [their
strengthened relations in the environmental secto]{.underline}r, whose
importance would be constantly growing over time, [would increase their
geopolitical relevance both regionally and globally]{.underline}. [The
EU's increased power in the Arctic would be reflected at the
international level as its relations with Russia would be positively
affected from regional developments.]{.underline} At the same time,
cooperation with the EU would increase Russia's power both regionally
and internationally.

### Solves -- Fisheries 

#### The EU can promote sustainable fishing in the Arctic and protect biodiversity

international relations with broad experience in over five countries.

the Baltic and the Black Sea. "The European Union and the Arctic: the
Case of Fishery" The Yearbook of the Polar Law XV, 12/4,
https://brill.com/view/journals/yplo/15/1/article-p231_9.xml //tk
***Note - GD = European Green Deal***

[Among the sectors of the blue economy, fishing]{.underline}, together
with petroleum, [is the most important natural resources in the
Arctic]{.underline}.38 [Approximately 15 percent of the world's marine
fish is caught in the Arctic.]{.underline}39 Fishery operates especially
in Greenlandic and Norwegian waters but also in the Barents Sea, the
Norwegian Sea and in the Bering Sea that constitute the Arctic High
Seas.40 In particular, the pollock fisheries in the Bering Sea and the
cod fisheries in the Barents Sea are the most important ones in terms of
value.41

[The fisheries sector, like all the other blue economy
sectors]{.underline} (aquaculture, maritime tourism, and maritime
transportation), [is growing in the Arctic coastal states but not at a
fast pace.]{.underline}42 Its development is due to political, economic,
social, technological, environmental, and legal factors.43 Many of them
are external to the Arctic like global markets and prices that drive oil
and gas, shipping, and fishing and aquaculture to a certain extent.44
Other external drivers are [technological development and climate
change]{.underline}.45 The former enables all sectors to operate in the
harsh Arctic environment.46 The latter [has a mixed impact on
fishery]{.underline}47 [as it affects biodiversity in such a way that
warmer temperatures can reduce the growth rates and survival of some
species like wild salmon while ensuring better access to food for other
species such as cod and herring.]{.underline}48 Additionally, [new areas
can become more attractive for fishing because of ice
melting.]{.underline}49

[Biodiversity]{.underline}, together with climate change, [is at the
core of the EGD. The EU's 2021 Arctic Policy clearly
states]{.underline}, in fact, [that biodiversity and climate change are
"two sides of the same coin"]{.underline} as they are interdependent.50
Additionally, [in 2021 the EU adopted the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030
aiming at protecting nature and at reversing the degradation of
ecosystems]{.underline}.51 [This Strategy envisages the unlocking of
funding for biodiversity]{.underline} and the setting of a strengthened
governance framework aiming at improving the actions taken to protect
the environment (e.g. better implementation, financing and investing,
business decision-making).52 [According to the European Commission, the
implementation of these actions demonstrates that the EU "is ready to
lead by example to address the global biodiversity
crisis".]{.underline}53 [The Biodiversity Strategy is considered an
effective instrument to address the problem]{.underline}. [The new
European biodiversity governance framework will put in place a
monitoring and review mechanism that "will ensure co-responsibility and
co-ownership by all relevant actors in meeting the EU's biodiversity
commitments".]{.underline}54 It is in this perspective that [the EU has
created the European Maritime, Fisheries, and Aquaculture
Fund]{.underline} (EMFAF). Its main aim is [to **conserve marine
biological resources**, which is essential to **ensure food security**
as it means the supply of seafood products,]{.underline} growth of a
sustainable blue economy, [and **healthy, safe and sustainably managed
seas**]{.underline} and oceans.55 In doing so, [the EMFAF facilitates
the transition to sustainable, low-carbon fishing and the protection of
marine]{.underline} biodiversity and [ecosystems]{.underline}.56 It also
helps fulfil the objectives of the EGD and achieve the UN's Sustainable
Development Goal 14, namely 'conserve and sustainably use the oceans,
seas and marine resources', to which the EU is committed.57 The EMFAF
runs from 2021 to 2027 and supports the CFP, the EU maritime policy and
the EU agenda for international ocean governance.58

[The necessity to address the global biodiversity crisis and the fight
to climate change is a common interest to the EU and the Arctic
states.]{.underline} The Arctic, which is warming four times faster than
the rest of the world59 and regulates the temperature of the earth, is
crucial in the climate change problem and therefore in the biodiversity
crisis both regionally and globally. Thus, the Arctic states have
obviously strong geopolitical, economic and environmental interests to
work together to protect the region they belong to. In the case of the
EU, its commitment to dealing with the urgency of these issues is
combined with its geopolitical aims to deepen its involvement in Arctic
affairs. Fishery offers an excellent opportunity to achieve these aims
because it is one of the blue economy sectors and a key sector in the
Arctic. In this context, it is important to emphasize that [the EU
closely cooperates with the Arctic states by financing research aiming
at advancing "the ocean-climate nexus science in an endeavour to better
understand the role of seas]{.underline} and ocean, including the
Earth's icecaps, in climate change and help secure the long-term
provision of ecosystem services, such as climate change adaptation and
mitigation and carbon sequestration (both on land and sea)".60 However,
the war in Ukraine has halted research cooperation as well as political
and economic cooperation in the Arctic. Thus, almost all international
cooperative efforts with Russia in the Arctic (e.g. polar bear and whale
studies, research on commercial fishing, permafrost thaw, sea-ice
retreat, peatland ecology, and wildfires) are frozen.61 As biologist
Eric Regehr of the US Fish and Wildlife Service has stated, much of the
impact of climate change on the Arctic environment is being lost.62 He
also stresses that it will be very difficult both for the West and
Russia to resume the science without the government and non-government
funding, and without cooperation between the western and the Russian
scientists.63

Scientific research is crucial in the fight against climate change as
well as in the understanding of the changes occurring in the Arctic
marine ecosystem. Therefore, it is a key tool for the EU to strengthen
its relations with the Arctic states, which is included in the EU Arctic
Policies since 2008. For instance, the 2021 Arctic Policy states that
"the EU has built strong international networks on Arctic research as a
diplomatic tool, including bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation
Agreements with Canada, Russia and the US".64

Furthermore, [all EU Arctic Policies include references to
fishery]{.underline}. Both the 2008 and 2012 Arctic Policies stress that
[the EU's main objective is to ensure a sustainable exploitation of
Arctic fisheries resources while respecting the rights of local
populations]{.underline} as well as the relevance of cooperation between
the EU and the coastal Arctic states to this aim (European Commission,
2008;65 European Commission, 2012).66 The 2016 Arctic Policy highlights
the EU's commitment to help the Arctic states to monitor potential
opportunities for sustainable economic opportunities including blue
economy sectors like fishery.67 Finally, the 2021 Arctic Policy
emphasizes the fact that the EU aims at stimulating "an innovative green
transition, where the Arctic regions can showcase future-compatible job
creation in innovative sectors"68 including fishery inter alia.69

Also, [all Arctic Policies include the principle of sustainable
development, which is obviously strictly linked to the EU's 'sustainable
blue economy']{.underline}. Sustainable development, which means that
"development must meet the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs",70 is "at the
heart of the European project and the EU Treaties give recognition to
its economic, social and environmental dimensions that should be tackled
together".71 Its priorities are combating poverty, supporting
sustainable management of natural and environmental resources and
promoting good governance at all levels.72

#### The EU can empirically promote fisheries -- Greenland proves.

**Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries**, 20**24** --
The Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is the
commission department responsible for EU policy on maritime affairs and
fisheries. "European Union and Greenland renew their sustainable
fisheries partnership" European Commission, 12/24,
https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/news/european-union-and-greenland-renew-their-sustainable-fisheries-partnership-2024-12-12_en
//tk

Today marks a milestone in the enduring partnership between [the
European Union and Greenland]{.underline} as they [officially signed the
renewed protocol implementing the sustainable fisheries partnership
agreement]{.underline} (SFPA).

Covering the next 6 years (2025-2030), [this agreement will allow EU
vessels to fish key species like cod, redfish, and shrimp in Greenland.
It reinforces the EU and Greenland's shared **commitment to sustainable
fisheries** and]{.underline} mutual [economic progress]{.underline}, and
to continuing a fruitful collaboration in fisheries governance.

Key elements of the agreement

[Revised fishing opportunities: the adjustments are based on scientific
advice]{.underline}, with increases for cod and redfish quotas, and
necessary reductions for west halibut and east prawn.

Boosted financial package: [The EU\'s annual contribution increases to
€17.3 million. This includes €3.2 million earmarked for sectoral
support, aimed at **strengthening Greenland's fisheries**.]{.underline}

Balanced sustainability: [The protocol strikes a fair balance between
environmental sustainability and economic viability]{.underline},
ensuring significant fishing opportunities for the EU fleet while
respecting the ecosystem's needs.

### Solves -- Indigenous

#### The EU can boost assistance for indigenous peoples development globally

**European Commission**, 20**22** - Directorate-General for
International Partnerships "EU boosts support to indigenous peoples'
rights around the world" 8/9,
<https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/eu-boosts-support-indigenous-peoples-rights-around-world-2022-08-09_en>
//DH

On the occasion of the International Day of the World's Indigenous
Peoples, [the EU announced it is investing a further €7 million to
promote and protect indigenous peoples' rights worldwide]{.underline}.
These funds are part of a wider €27 million Global Gateway investment
package into fair, accountable and inclusive trade and business to boost
sustainability in global supply chains.

Global value chains are a key feature of today's global economy, linked
to about half of world trade. The globalisation of the economy has
brought with it clear and enormous economic and social benefits, but it
has also contributed to severe environmental damage, serious human
rights violations and wrongful labour practices such as forced labour,
child labour and trafficking in human beings.

Indigenous peoples who have been exposed to adverse corporate behaviour
often have limited means to hold the perpetrators accountable. Impunity
has in fact reached alarming levels in many indigenous territories, with
economic interests prevailing over social and environmental laws,
policies and safeguards. One out of three human rights defenders killed
in 2020 belonged to an indigenous community.

[To enhance the duty of states to protect]{.underline}, and the
responsibility of corporations to respect human rights, [the EU will
support national and global level advocacy by indigenous communities
that are particularly at risk of]{.underline} corporate human rights
violations and [environmental harm]{.underline}.

[The EU will invest in enabling indigenous communities to monitor and
report human rights abuses and environmental damage, and to carry out

### Solves -- Regulation / Legal Standards

#### The EU is a regulatory superpower that can shape legal standards Merje Kuus 2020 \-- Merje Kuus is a full Professor in the Faculty of Arts at UBC, specializing in transnational regulatory practices in contemporary Europe, with a PhD in Geography and extensive research on Arctic governance. "Regulatory power and region-making in the Arctic: China and the European Union" European Urban and Regional Studies, 6/12/2020, https://journals.sagepub.com/ //AH

[China's activities in and toward the Arctic have been fueled in
particular by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a set of
infrastructure projects]{.underline} that was launched by the Chinese
government in 2013. The BRI is designed to better link China to foreign
markets and especially Europe through maritime, rail, and
telecommunications infrastructure (Lin et al., 2019). The project, which
currently involves over 150 countries, has engendered massive Chinese
investment and concomitant political attention to many parts of the
world, including the Arctic. As a part of the BRI, China is exploring
the possibilities of shipping through the Northern Sea Route in the
Russian Arctic (Bennett, 2015). Its Arctic policy was officially
formulated in the 2018 Arctic White Paper, which labeled China as a
'near-Arctic state' (Eiterjord, 2019). [The country has organized nine
Arctic expeditions of its own and **funds a great deal of Arctic
research**.]{.underline} It has two icebreakers (one of which is
Chinese-built) and several other ship-building projects are in the
works. China also has three ice-capable cargo vessels, delivered in 2017
and 2018. In April 2019, China and Russia announced a plan to connect
The Northern Sea Route to China's Maritime Silk Road. All of these
activities are a part of the so-called Polar Silk Road, itself a part of
the BRI (Eiterjord, 2019). [The EU is pursuing an equally long-term
strategy]{.underline}, but it has less visible success to report.
Although three of the eight Arctic Council member states are EU members,
as are six of the 13 observer states, the Union's institutions want to
be in the room as players in their own right. The Union, and this means
in particular the [European Commission]{.underline} as the EU's
regulatory engine, [adopted its own policy toward the Arctic in 2016.
Its institutions actively engage with Arctic Council member and observer
states to enhance the Union's diplomatic presence in the Arctic. What
the EU seeks is the creation of what Raspotnik]{.underline} (2008: 5)
[calls EU Arctic space---'a regulated regional space of
interaction.]{.underline}' Raspotnik is correct to describe the [Union's
goals]{.underline} not in terms of regional integration but rather in
terms of something as seemingly vague as [a 'regulated'
space]{.underline}. That regulatory aspect of regionalism is
understudied, in part because it is nebulous and abstract. In the
popular imagination, [the competition in the Arctic is largely an
inter-state affair]{.underline}. We hear about Russia planting a flag
under the North Pole in 2008, China sending military ships into US
territorial waters off the coast of Alaska in 2015, or Canada and
Denmark engaging in a territorial dispute about a barren rock called
Hans Island over many years. We do not hear about the international and
transnational standardization of economic, political, and social life.
However, the challenges for a nuanced understanding of Arctic governance
are not only about the boundaries or ownership of land, water, drilling,
or fishing rights. The challenges are also about the labeling of seal
products, the codification of the search and rescue regulations, the
standards of environmental impact assessments---the entire regulatory
framework on which regional integration is built. Two clarifications
about regulatory power are necessary here. Firstly, in the Arctic, as in
the Antarctic, the regulation of the region is up for grabs more than
first meets the eye. Until the end of the Cold War and the onset of
dramatic warming effects, the Arctic was a relatively unregulated space
by virtue of its inaccessibility and its role in the military strategies
of the two superpowers. As Anne-Marie Brady (2017: 15, 29, 189) points
out, there is no clear precedent on many spheres of activity in the
polar regions: the precedents are being made and codified right now (see
also Koivurova et al., 2017: 3). Although the Arctic Council (n.d.)
asserts the existence of an extensive regulatory framework in the
region, there is no such pre-existing framework that is simply being
extended to the region: that framework is currently being built in bits
and pieces. Arctic states have indeed actively sought to block the
emergence of a robust international regulatory regime in the region
(Brady, 2017: 18). The actual practice of who pays for research and
whose citizens reside in the region matters: this is why states use
scientific activity as an entry-way into Arctic governance. In terms of
Arctic shipping, the ships themselves, in terms of their design,
movement, or insurance, are tightly regulated already. My point is 322
European Urban and Regional Studies 27(4) about the slow, almost
imperceptible, regulatory processes that influence what happens on the
sovereign territory of states. Secondly, it [is a mistake to assume that
regulatory competition is usually a race to the bottom: the one who
regulates less wins. This is not necessarily the case, legal
scholar]{.underline} Anu [Bradford (2019) explains. In many spheres, it
is the one who regulates more stringently that wins.]{.underline} This
is firstly because, for the producers of goods and services, it makes
sense to adhere to the standards of the most regulated market if it is a
large market. [It is for this reason that the EU's standards on data
protection have such an impact on online activity globally.]{.underline}
Bradford calls this the de facto regulatory effect. In addition, there
is the de jure effect, which refers to the regulatory agenda of the
party that follows a particular regulation. Once a party follows a
specific regulatory framework, it has a vested interest in promoting
that same framework in its dealings with third parties. This can
multiply the influence of the early regulators. Pipelines, fiberoptic
cables, railways, and shipping lines require detailed international
standards regardless of who operates them. Chinese companies know that
their unfamiliarity with the patchwork of rules in the countries
affected by the BRI makes their investments vulnerable to legal disputes
(Yin, 2018; see also Liu and Hossain, 2017: 248). Strict regulation
enables rather than disables complex international projects. For China,
one of the most consequential current negotiations is the [Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment with the EU. The provisions of that agreement
will have farreaching effects on the relationships among Arctic powers
and on their relations with third parties. This is how the EU as a
'regulatory superpower' comes in]{.underline}.1 [To grasp the long-term
directions of regulatory change in the Arctic]{.underline}, [we need to
consider]{.underline} what Bradford (2019) calls [the Brussels Effect:
that is, the EU's 'unilateral power to regulate global
markets']{.underline} (p. xiv). [The term unilateral in her definition
does not negate the Union's emphasis on multilateralism; it rather
counters the trite vision of the EU as a fading power]{.underline}. A
diplomatic professional puts the difference between national and EU
diplomats this way: '[An ambassador promotes trade; an EU ambassador
creates the conditions in which trade can flourish']{.underline} (Kuus,
2017: 263). This supports Bradford's (2019: 25) point that the [EU's
regulatory power results not only from its market size but also from the
regulatory capacity of its institutions]{.underline}. Geographers have
accomplished a great deal by examining state actors beyond great powers,
by closely considering non-state actors, and by investigating
non-territorial forms of spatial practice. Neither the old vocabulary of
states nor the new one about non-state actors make much of the EU's
regulatory power. This is in part because the union is an infamously
complex transnational body. It is also in part because our gaze tends to
be focused on states. Incorporating regulatory power into our analyses
would enable us to study non-territorial aspects of region building with
greater nimbleness and precision. Detailed work on regulatory power in
the Arctic is yet to be done: my objective here is simply to highlight
its import. [We must be careful to not build our understanding of the
Arctic on 'narrow and outdated ideas of what power means
today']{.underline} (Bradford, 2019: x). Paraphrasing the diplomatic
professional whom I quote above, [we must examine region-making in the
Arctic not only in terms of the actors in the Arctic but also in terms
of the regulatory conditions in which Arctic regionalism can
flourish.]{.underline} The EU is no great power: it is a regulatory
power.

### Solves -- Renewables

#### The EU has the capacity to drive a green transition in the Arctic

**European Commission**, 20**21** -- press release. "New EU Arctic
Policy Released - A stronger EU engagement for a greener, peaceful and
prosperous Arctic" The Arctic Portal and the European Commission, 12/13,

CB

Today, the High Representative and the Commission put forward their
approach for a stronger EU engagement for a peaceful, sustainable and
prosperous Arctic.

[The Arctic region is of key strategic importance for the European
Union, in view of climate change, raw materials as well as geostrategic
influence.]{.underline}
The [Communication](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/105481/joint-communication-stronger-eu-engagement-peaceful-sustainable-and-prosperous-arctic_en) responds
to these [geopolitical, environmental, economic, security and social
challenges and opportunities]{.underline}. It [seeks to foster
cooperation with partners on sustainable approaches]{.underline} to
overcome them.

The EU will establish a European Commission office in Greenland, which
will raise the profile of Arctic matters in the EU\'s external
relations. [EU funding will also be directed towards driving the green
transition in the Arctic, for the benefit of Arctic
populations.]{.underline}

Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) and in support of
global climate action, the Communication calls for oil, coal and gas to
remain in the ground.

Josep **Borrell,** High Representative of the European Union for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission,
said: *"[The Arctic is changing rapidly, owing to the impact of global
warming, increased competition for natural resources and geopolitical
rivalries. These developments show that Europe must define its
geopolitical interests broadly to promote stability, safety and peaceful
cooperation in the Arctic."]{.underline}*

Virginijus **Sinkevičius**, Commissioner for the Environment, Fisheries
and Maritime Affairs said: *"The Arctic region is warming three times
faster than the rest of the planet. The melting of ice and thawing of
permafrost in the Arctic further accelerate climate change and have huge
knock-on effects. [The EU is committed to make the Arctic safe, stable,
sustainable and prosperous. Safe and stable, through enhanced
international cooperation; sustainable and prosperous, by ensuring a
strong link between the EU\'s Arctic engagement and our climate policy,
the European Green Deal and its blue economy dimension".]{.underline}*

[Scientific research is crucial in the fight against climate change as
well as in]{.underline} the [understanding]{.underline} of the changes
occurring in [the Arctic marine ecosystem]{.underline}. Therefore, [it
is a key tool for the EU to strengthen its relations with the Arctic
states, which is included in the EU Arctic Policies since
2008]{.underline}. For instance, the 2021 Arctic Policy states that
"[the EU has built strong international networks on Arctic research as a
diplomatic tool]{.underline}, including bilateral Science and Technology
Cooperation Agreements with Canada, Russia and the US".64

[The European Commission has launched a transformative
€7.3bn]{.underline} investment through the 2025 Horizon Europe work
[programme, aimed at propelling Europe to the forefront of **global
research, innovation, and sustainability**]{.underline}.

[This ambitious funding plan is set to drive scientific excellence,
speed up the green and digital transitions, and boost Europe's economic
resilience in an increasingly competitive world.]{.underline}

[The 2025 programme forms a key part of Horizon Europe --- the EU's
flagship €93.5bn research and innovation initiative running until
2027.]{.underline}

With a renewed focus on talent, climate action, digital leadership, and
global collaboration, the updated work programme reflects the EU's
strategic priorities while simplifying access for researchers and
innovators across the continent and beyond.

Stéphane [Séjourné, Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and
Industrial Strategy, added: "Research and innovation are at the heart of
European competitiveness.]{.underline}

"With this €7.3bn investment through Horizon Europe for 2025, we will
boost European prosperity and competitiveness, address key challenges in
security and defence, and facilitate the clean transition."

Thawing permafrost Protection of the well-being of Arctic communities
Permafrost is ground below surface that has been frozen for at least two
consecutive years and in most cases, for hundreds or thousands of years.
[As global temperatures rise, permafrost thaws, releasing greenhouse
gases that threaten to cause irreversible changes in the Arctic and
other regions. Gaining more knowledge on this phenomenon is essential
because over 70% of Arctic infrastructure and 45% of oil extraction
fields are built on permafrost.]{.underline} In addition to black
carbon, [thawing permafrost risks to release pathogens, such as anthrax,
or contaminants like mercury. The EU will improve knowledge of this
process, using satellite observation and measurements from aircraft,
ships and ground stations.]{.underline} Further research is needed to
develop adaptation and mitigation measures and increase knowledge of the
impact on communities and sustainable development. [The EU already
supports these activities under Horizon 2020 in the Nunataryuk project,
and in the Arctic Passion project. These projects will monitor and
forecast permafrost thaw and map permafrost parameters using Copernicus
satellites and in situ observations]{.underline}, including data
provided by indigenous groups. A key goal will be closer cooperation
with the Arctic states, in creating data and services for permafrost
areas [to improve environmental and health security and develop
mitigation measures.]{.underline}

#### EU has experience with development, international cooperation and scientific research in the Arctic

Serhii **Nasadiuk**, 6/17/20**24** \-\-- Political analyst, University
of Tartu graduate, former research trainee at Finabel focusing on
European security and defense policy ("The Role Of The EU In Arctic
Security," https://finabel.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SN-PDF.pdf /,
SKR)

In recent years, [the European Union has launched and invested in many
projects related to climate change, environmental protection,
sustainable development, international cooperation, scientific research,
and innovation in the Arctic]{.underline} region.

[EU countries also actively participate in NATO military exercises to
ensure the security and stability of the Arctic region and to deter
potential threats from Russia]{.underline}. For example, one of the most
extensive exercises since the Cold War took place in Norway and
surrounding seas, called \"Cold Response 2022.\" These exercises
involved around 30.000 troops from 27 countries training in cold weather
conditions and testing the readiness of allies to operate under any
circumstances (NATO, 2022). These exercises indicate that [EU countries
and NATO members are interested in the stability of the Arctic region
and are ready to ensure security by increasing their military potential
in the region.]{.underline}

One of the most significant EU research and innovation projects was
Horizon 2020, which focused on stimulating economic growth and creating
jobs. It aimed to provide European science with worldclass technology,
remove barriers to innovation and facilitate public and private sector
collaboration on innovation (European Commission, 2020.). The next
project, which essentially replaced Horizon 2020, is Horizon Europe,
with the main goals of combatting climate change, solving global
problems of humanity, and increasing Europe\'s competitiveness.
Nevertheless, new elements were added to the project: the European
Innovation Council, 5 main mission areas, an open science policy and a
new approach to partnerships (European Commission, 2021.).

[The European Union tries to influence the socio-economic development of
Arctic states and parties interested in the Arctic through **investments
in scientific research** and financing **cross-border cooperation** in
the Arctic region]{.underline}. Such initiatives are \"Arctic ROOS\",
which includes 20 institutions from 11 EU countries, and \"EU-PolarNet:
Coordinating and Co-designing the European Polar Research Area\", which
consists of representatives of all EU member states and associated
countries (EU Arctic Initiatives, n.d.).

Notably, the [European Union funds programs aimed at ensuring security
and monitoring changes in the region\'s ecosystem]{.underline}. These
include programs such as" Copernicus" and other [EU-specific research
projects]{.underline}, which [contribute to maintaining maritime safety
through monitoring and controlling vessel traffic and ice
conditions]{.underline}, as well as providing navigation services (EU
Arctic Initiatives, n.d.).

### Solves -- Search & Rescue 

#### The E.U search and rescue involves the Joint Arctic Command, a network that can follow up findings 

**AECO** News & Event 20**23,** ("AECO is dedicated to ensuring that
expedition cruise tourism benefits the regions it visits, with a strong
focus on the natural environment, cultural preservation, local
communities, and safe operations at sea and on land., July 20^th^,
https://aeco.no/joint-arctic-search-and-rescue-jasa-network-established/)

[JASA is based on the need to establish a network that can follow up
relevant findings from SAR exercises]{.underline}, otherwise serving as
a platform for sharing experiences and innovations and creating
opportunities for new initiatives.

[JASA is a unique voluntary network where effective collaborative
measures connected to Arctic Search and Rescue are achievable since all
members share the same goals and vision, says Frigg Jørgensen, AECO's
executive director.]{.underline}

Since 2016 AECO has collaborated with Arctic SAR entities to enhance
safety in Arctic expedition cruise operations. The work has been done
through joint exercises, training, workshops, meetings, information
exchange, projects, and much more.

This year, the Joint Arctic SAR Event* from findings to actions,* made
it clear that a more systematic and result-oriented follow-up on
findings and areas in need of improvement is necessary. The idea of JASA
was born.

Together with partners[, such as the Canadian and Icelandic Coast Guard,
the Joint Arctic Command, and the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in
Norway, the network will address and act on issues connected to maritime
safety and SAR in Arctic expedition cruise operations.]{.underline}

#### EU's global satellite (Galileo) navigation system provides Search and Rescue services

**Christian** Blanco 20**24**, (Christian Blanco is an assistant
professor of operations management at the Fisher College of Business. He
joined the Operations and Business Analytics department (formerly
Management Sciences) after receiving his Ph.D. from the UCLA Anderson
School of Management in 2017, "EU's presence in the Arctic", March
5^th^, https://finabel.org/eus-presence-in-the-arctic/")

The EU presence in the Arctic region is acquiring decisive importance in
terms of security and defence, especially since the escalation of the
Russo-Ukrainian war. However, not only geopolitical rivalries are an
important change, but also the opportunism of the effect of global
warming and the increase in commercial interest in natural resources.
The joint communication of 2021, October 13, [A stronger EU engagement
for a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic, proposed that the EU
pursue a secure, stable, sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous Arctic
region. There is a need to adopt a strengthened maritime security
policy, especially in the areas of economic development]{.underline},
free trade, transport, and energy security. The *Strategic Compass* of
2021, March 21, foresaw that the EU in the Arctic will fight in the
coming decades against climate change, natural disasters and
environmental degradation, in addition to the intensification of
geopolitical competition and tensions also in terms of resources and
transportation routes (Council of the EU, 2021). In this regard, the EU
Council published in its *Conclusions* of 2021, March 8, that close
cooperation was required with partner countries, the international
organisations involved (i.e. the UN) and multilateral partnerships.

On  February 28, 2024, EU defence and security in the Arctic is becoming
a priority. Especially on the north coast and in the North Pole (Russian
Arctic), [the current geopolitical situation is leading the EU to adopt
measures in the field of strategic positioning, internal priorities, or
the dual use of infrastructure (Padrtova, B., 2020). For example**, the
EU Satellite Centre** (SatCen) ensures geospatial security by monitoring
the region; **Galileo offers search and rescue security services;** and
the Galileo Regulated Public Service seeks unlimited and uninterrupted
access to navigate in the Arctic waters of the EU to its authorised
users.]{.underline}

[Moreover, there would be three variables to consider for strong EU
security and defence in the Arctic. First, the dominions of the Kingdom
of Denmark also encompass Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which is a
strategic area that became a focal point in terms of Arctic
diplomacy]{.underline} (Kočí, A.; Baar, V., 2021). Secondly, Finland
joined the NATO on April 4, 2023, marked a *before and after* in terms
of protecting water domains from Russian influence and affecting the
Arctic in terms of free trade, trade routes, and global maritime
transport. Third, Sweden joined the NATO on February 26, 2024, was
intended to close this area of influence.

However, not only military actions by sea, land or air are a threat in
terms of security and defence. Among others, climate change and melting
ice become greater strategic competition, the Barents Sea accumulates
spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, and current geopolitical
tensions are leading actors to seek benefits for energy resources.
Finally, Russia is not the only threat to the EU's presence in the
Arctic region. The activities of other actors (i.e. China) are making
the area more insecure, for instance, through growing interest in
infrastructure ownership, maritime cable construction, global shipping,
cyberspace, and disinformation.

#### And, it's improving over time.

[21 international partners will join forces to enhance Arctic search and
rescue through the new ARCSAR network. Having secured €3.5 million in EU
funding, the project will run for five years and include a live exercise

cooperation]{.underline} and innovation in security and [emergency
response in the Arctic]{.underline} and the North Atlantic.

[The ARCSAR network is led by the Joint Rescue Coordination Center

the project. ]{.underline}ARCSAR will involve partners from Finland,
Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands, the US, Canada, Russia, Italy,
Germany, UK, Ireland and New Zealand.

[The Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO), which
represents the majority of expedition cruise operators that sail in
Arctic waters, will work closely with authorities, SAR responders and
researchers to determine how SAR preparedness and response can be
strengthened and developed. Frigg Jørgensen, Executive director of AECO,
stated:]{.underline}

In a time of increased activity in the Arctic, the ARCSAR project is an
important and timely initiative. The expedition cruise industry is
already working closely with Arctic SAR entities, and this network will
make it possible to take full advantage of the knowledge, experience and
best practices we are identifying.

Mr. Jørgensen further underlined that passenger vessels represent an
important asset in Arctic marine preparedness.

During search and rescue operations in remote parts of the Arctic,
expedition cruise ships can be the first to arrive on site. Cruise ships
carry food, water, medical supplies, doctors, numerous high speed small
vessels and other resources that are useful in SAR operations. Previous
tabletop exercises organized by AECO and SAR entities have shown that
there is a potential for making better use of these resources. ARCSAR's
planned live exercise will be a valuable opportunity to continue to
learn and improve cooperation.

Just 60 nautical miles off Svalbard, in the freezing arctic waters, the
second-largest rescue operation was deemed successful thanks to Galileo
Search and Rescue capabilities. 

Receding sea ice is opening up the Arctic Ocean and is enabling longer
seasons of ship navigation and new access to previously
difficult-to-reach ports. According to an Arctic Council report, the
number of ships entering the Arctic grew by 25% between 2013-2019.
Increased maritime traffic in polar regions presents many challenges
mainly due to the remoteness from shore. In the event of ship grounding
or collision Search and Rescue crews need to defy, rough seas and
freezing temperatures to timely evacuate the ship.

200 passengers]{.underline} onboard, located northwest of Spitsbergen
far from roads, cabins, rescue crews and other infrastructure. [To send
the distress signal the crew onboard the vessel activated a
Galileo-enabled EPIRB compatible with the Return Link Service, a unique
Galileo feature. Upon activation]{.underline}, it took [only 2:20
minutes for the Galileo System to track down the ship with an accuracy
below one kilometer and deliver an SOS acknowledgement to the active
EPIRB. Once]{.underline} the Mission Control Centers received the
distress signal and established the location, two Super Puma helicopters
from the Governor of Svalbard, a Sea King from 330 squadron of the
[Royal Norwegian Air Force and the Norwegian coast guard support vessel
were scrambled to support the massive evacuation of the
passengers.]{.underline}

'['The **AMRO** 2021 exercise was an excellent opportunity for the
European Union Agency for the Space Programme to showcase the power of
**Galileo** SAR but also the robust performance of Galileo at high
latitudes in comparison to other GNSS constellations'']{.underline} says
Guerric Pont, Head of Galileo Department at EUSPA. 

Since the declaration of its Initial Services in December 2016, Galileo
has enabled a multitude of new solutions across all market segments. One
of the system's unique features is the pioneering Galileo Return Link
Service (RLS). The Galileo RLS allows people in distress to receive an
automatic acknowledgment that their signal has been picked up by the
first responders. Galileo's contribution to the Medium Earth Orbit
Satellites Search and Rescue System (MEOSAR) managed by the
International COSPAS-SARSAT Programme translates into 2000 lives saved
per year.

[How is the EU contributing to the work in the Arctic?]{.underline} EU
interests in the Arctic touch upon many topics including environment,
energy, transport, and fisheries. [The European Union has long been
active in Arctic cooperation, not least in the Northern Dimension policy
shared with Russia, Norway, Iceland, Finland and Sweden and in the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council. The Commission,]{.underline} as well as the
European Environment Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency,
have also been an ad-hoc observer in the Arctic Council for many years
and have contributed to the Council\'s work. [The EU is one of the
largest contributors to Arctic research: € 200 million has been
committed since 2002 from the EU budget, excluding the individual
contributions from EU Member States. The commercial fleet controlled by
the EU Member States is one of the largest in the world and the EU
industry has significant experience in]{.underline} shipping,
shipbuilding, satellite navigation, **[search and rescue]{.underline}**
as well as port infrastructure development. Furthermore, the EU provides
a significant amount of funding through various initiatives to
indigenous peoples and local populations. Funding programmes during the
2007-2013 cofinancing period amount to €1.14 billion, or €1.98 billion
including EU Member States cofinancing. 7. Why are the European
Commission and the High Representative presenting this Communication? In
2008, the Commission adopted its first Communication specifically on the
Arctic (see IP/08/1750). Since then, the EU has made significant
progress on the 47 proposals concerning the Arctic that were first
tabled in 2008, including actions against climate change, protection of
the Arctic environment, contribution to Arctic research and economic
development in the region. Following a request by the Council of the
European Union, the document adopted today reviews the EU\'s
contribution to the Arctic since 2008. It also sets out a path for
future enhanced engagement with Arctic partners. In order to respond to
the new challenges and building on the [EU\'s contribution to date, it
underlines the need for a coherent, targeted EU approach towards the
Arctic, building on the EU's strengths, promoting responsible
development while engaging more extensively in dialogue and cooperation
with all Arctic]{.underline} aceful development in this region --
through investment in knowledge, promote a responsible approach to
commercial opportunities and constructive engagement with Arctic States
and indigenous peoples.

### Solves -- Ship Safety

#### New EU navigation and anti-icing tech solves Arctic ship safety risks

**European Commission** 20**21** The European Commission is the
executive body of the European Union ("EU research cuts the ice to
increase Arctic sea safety,"
https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/429581-eu-research-cuts-the-ice-to-increase-arctic-sea-safety,
SR)

A rapid rise in maritime traffic in [the Arctic region]{.underline}
together with an extremely harsh environment [poses severe challenges
for ship navigation]{.underline}. [EU-funded project SEDNA has developed
an integrated risk-based approach to steer vessels to
safety]{.underline}.

Safety measures for Arctic voyages

Paramount in the quest for safety in Arctic navigation is voyage
planning and an understanding of ice conditions. The SEDNA project has
developed several themes in parallel to achieve this while maintaining
the integrity of the Arctic's fragile ecosystem.

[The researchers have developed the 'Safe Arctic Bridge-- an
evidence-based, user-tested design framework to reliably support safer
traffic movements in the Arctic.]{.underline} "Our ideas were [embedded
in virtual and augmented reality]{.underline} [and include new map
overlays]{.underline}, colour palettes, [iconography and new
collaborative tools]{.underline}," notes Randall.

A customized Arctic voyage planning tool has been combined with an
existing vessel management and monitoring system sold by consortium
member GreenSteam. While still at the prototype stage, for the first
time, [customers can see weather, ice, route and ship-specific
operational parameters all in one interface and can easily plan new or
alternative routes]{.underline}.'

[Nature provides some anti-icing engineering solutions]{.underline}

The research group at University College London have also addressed
cutting icing from ships by taking three approaches. [Ice loads on a
ship's hull affect the hull structure's safety and the ship's
manoeuvring performance in ice-covered regions]{.underline}. To deal
with this, [the team]{.underline} has [developed smart and
multifunctional coatings with integrated anti-icing/de-icing
capabilities.]{.underline}

Passive anti-icing occurs by virtue of their micro/nanoscale surface
roughness causing superhydrophobic behaviour. As Randall explains:
"Basically, [ice finds it hard to \'stick\' or even form on the
surface."]{.underline}

Nature-inspired principles lie behind biosurfaces that mimic
duck/penguin feathers or rose and lotus leaves that all use air pockets
to help prevent water adhesion due to the shape of the underlying
surface.

[The last prong of ice formation defence is electrothermal.]{.underline}
As the name suggests[, electricity is used to thermally remove ice
build-up on a surface]{.underline}. Researchers did more lab testing in
the large ice testing tanks at Aalto University in Finland when a
problem arose with field testing due to COVID-19.

This paper has sought to answer the question: in light of growing global
geopolitical tensions, what role does the EU seek to take in the Arctic?
Explaining the rise of the EU as a geopolitical commission under Von der
Leyen helps to understand a geopolitical reading of the EUAP. The EUAP
was published in 2021 under more stable military-geopolitical conditions
when climate change posed the biggest threat to global environmental
security. [With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the security dynamics
have, however, changed.]{.underline} [Military, energy and economic
security are now among the top priorities of EU foreign and security
policy. The EU is a comprehensive security provider on a European,
international and global scale, allowing it **to contribute to all types
of security questions** we currently face.]{.underline}

[Overall, the action plan of the EUAP, together with the new adjustments
in the Strategic Compass, seems to be a fit plan for the EU to increase
its status as an international security provider, be it in
environmental, economic or military terms.]{.underline} It is, however,
hard to tell how this will evolve, as uncertainties mark the
geopolitical situation of Europe and the Arctic. For now, the EU seeks
to become a constructive and responsible actor in the Arctic region as
it considers the region of strategic importance. [It does this by
protecting the Arctic environment, promoting its economic interests,
strengthening Arctic governance, increasing cooperation with regional
stakeholders, and focusing on a strong engagement with Arctic
communities.]{.underline}

Changing geopolitical context, EU-Russia Arctic relations

As previously discussed, the [Arctic is in a geopolitical transition
from an area of 'exceptionalism']{.underline} where geopolitical
conflict was not present to a contested area that is on the agenda of
major powers like Russia, the US, the EU and even China.

All the major crises on the European continent from 2007 until today
have had a continuously transformative effect on the EU-Russian trade
relationship. It was however the [illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia
that seriously affected the EU-Russian relationship]{.underline}.20) The
[EU depends on Russian energy goods, like oil, gas and coal, to ensure
EU-wide energy security. Russia uses this dependency to bring forth its
foreign security goals and strengthen its economy. This shows that
strategic autonomy would be all the more important for the EU's
economy.]{.underline}

[Major powers see the region's economic potential and seek to become
Arctic actors to compete in the race for natural resources hiding
underneath the Arctic ground.]{.underline} China and Russia are aware of
the Arctic's economic potential, specifically the [new emerging trading
routes and the natural resources]{.underline}. While the [EU is also
interested in these]{.underline}, the [EU calls for a value-based
approach following their rule of law and sets on cooperation with the
Arctic Council and NATO]{.underline}.

Following the outbreak of war, [EU-Russian trade relations have become
more complex.]{.underline} The EU has applied [unprecedented sanctions
on Russia]{.underline}n exports and imports to weaken their economy.
Disrupting EU-Russian trade relations has [driven Russia to further
collaborate with like-minded partners, like China]{.underline}. In 2018,
China declared itself a 'near-Arctic state' and plans to create a global
transport corridor within Russia's Northern Sea Route.21) [China is
planning to become a polar great power]{.underline} by 2030,22) which
they could [achieve by further cooperating with Russia]{.underline}.
This will not only impact the EU's external and internal market, but it
could also possibly l[ead to a paradigm shift in all currently
established global trade relations.]{.underline}

While the 2021 Arctic policy was written in accordance with the 2016
Global Strategy, the 2022 Strategic Compass seems to be fitter to
address the matters of geopolitics that are raised in the EUAP. Even
though the Arctic Council tries to keep geopolitical matters out of the
'exceptional' Arctic, the Arctic 7 (all members, excluding Russia),
decided to suspend their participation following Russia's unjustified
attack on Ukraine. [Deteriorating economic and political relations
between Russia and the West have shown that the Arctic is no longer an
'exceptional' region. Increasing militarization, territorial claims and
competition for resources are among the many burdens of the Arctic
region. This is the return of great power politics to the High
North]{.underline}.

While the collaboration among the A8 is paused, the EU can still act
according to its competencies. The EU may promote dialogue among the
Arctic states and Arctic stakeholders. The [EU acts as a mediator
through its **expertise in conflict resolution** to foster a spirit of
cooperation among all involved parties]{.underline}. Particular
[attention should be put on the Arctic Indigenous people]{.underline}.
One such initiative was the EU Arctic Forum and Indigenous Peoples'
Dialogue in Nuuk, Greenland, on 8-9 February 2023. To add, Thomas
Winkler and Louise Calais, Arctic ambassadors of Denmark and Sweden,
have recently stated that "the war has overshadowed the climate crisis
in the Arctic."23) The EU should thus redirect to its initial focus on
climate change through sustainable development and scientific research.
Overall, the [EU is continuously contributing towards strengthening
Arctic governance. By promoting the ratification and implementation of
international agreements, like the UNCLOS or the updated EU Maritime
security strategy, the EU can play a constructive role in promoting the
legal framework for managing the region's marine resources.]{.underline}

The above has demonstrated that the EUAP does not lay the grounds for
the EU to become a geopolitical actor in the traditional sense of
security but rather acts within a comprehensive security framework. This
goes along with Ian Manners' argument that the [EU's international role
in the context of world politics follows a representation of the EU as a
normative power]{.underline}.24)

Following recent developments, it is to be seen how far the EU will
follow its action plan as laid out in the Arctic strategy (2021) or if
it will possibly have to adapt it to the current geopolitical threats
that arose in 2022.

#### **EU intel sharing helps identify Arctic hybrid threats early**

IM)

1\. Know one's weaknesses and improve situational awareness

At present, there is no common definition or understanding of hybrid
threats across the Arctic region, which complicates cross-border
cooperation and harmonization of national responses to hybrid threats.
Establishing a unified understanding and definition of the threat is key
to building resilience to hybrid interference. The conceptual model
generated by the Hybrid CoE in Helsinki could serve as a model for an
Arctic-wide typology of threats. It is equally important that Western
Arctic states carry out risk and vulnerability assessments to better
understand where their weaknesses lie in order to create preventative
strategies, and evaluate what the future targets may be so as to design
effective strategies to counter hybrid aggression proactively. In
addition to developing a joint assessment of potential targets of hybrid
activities, it may be useful to develop an inventory of actors --
comprising both government actors as well as key private entities in
vulnerable sectors -- that can be reached in case a hybrid attack
occurs.164 Further, [the crossborder sharing of information and joint
intelligence efforts -- across the EU, **between the EU and NATO**, and
bilaterally -- **are essential** in order to identify threats early on,
understand how they are linked, and improve overall situational
awareness, risk assessment and planning of counter-hybrid
measures.]{.underline} Improving intelligence sharing and cooperation
should go hand in hand with the bolstering of regional intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.165

2\. Enhance transparency and public communications

It is important that governments clearly state when they uncover -- or
are targeted by -- a hybrid campaign, and make the goals and activities
of any particular malign actor visible to the broader public. Engaging
in a debate and clearly stating when false arguments are being used can
help raise public awareness of disinformation activities. But
governments also have other options at their disposal, such as
mechanisms for screening foreign investments or foreign funding
disclosure. Strict and clear rules on financial transparency should be
in place for political parties, research institutes, media and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) alike. Mandatory financial
disclosures can help deter and disrupt alliances between foreign hybrid
aggressors and domestic proxy groups.166 If the origins of the funding
can be tied to foreign security or intelligence organizations, the
governments should be in a position to close down the recipient
organization.167 Collective attribution -- arguably one of the strongest
means of punishing a hybrid aggressor -- remains a difficult issue, as
it touches on national sovereignty.168 Despite these challenges, Allies
need to determine an effective messaging strategy that shows that hybrid
activities will not be tolerated and that they will come at a cost that
attackers may not be willing to pay (i.e. clearly signal to Russia that
retaliation is feasible if attacked). Communicating successes is also
critical. As above, this may entail enhancing transparency when hybrid
activities are detected and shut down through official channels.

3\. Establish good governance structures

Strong democratic institutions, a culture of democratic participation,
and societal trust -- not only towards the government and parliament but
also the security authorities -- are important ingredients of a
whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach to countering hybrid
threats. Good governance itself reduces the level of vulnerability,
helps enhance social cohesion, and increases citizens' trust in public
authorities.169 While hybrid warfare seeks to exploit legal thresholds
and gaps, liberal democratic governments must ensure that their
counter-hybrid responses remain within the bounds of the rule of law,
transparency, and democratic oversight.170

4\. Foster quality education and critical media literacy

A well-educated and informed population, media literacy programs, and
proactive messaging can make a society more resilient to hybrid threats,
particularly in the information domain. Governments need to ensure that
both the general public and civil servants are wary of malign
interference and that they understand that hybrid threats go beyond
disinformation and cyberattacks, and constitute a broader strategic
issue. Efforts should be undertaken to educate and train government
officials, journalists, civil society representatives and the general
public alike to understand how to navigate the online environment (as
well as how it works), how social media posts are generated and paid
for, as well as how to critically analyze the content they consume.171
They have to be able to digest, analyze, make informed opinions about
the news, and understand what they are dealing with. Governments bear a
special responsibility to instill media literacy courses in primary and
secondary school curricula.

5\. Training and exercising

Consistent training and exercising is another important tool to deter
and mitigate the effects of hybrid threats. Exercises can help identify
possible hybrid threat scenarios, test hypotheses, as well as tactics
and procedures (such as contingency plans). On the whole, they can help
improve incident response mechanisms, prepare participating entities for
the full range of potential contingencies that they might face, and
enable them to work together to identify best practices and lessons
learned.172 NATO's 2018 Trident Juncture exercise, for instance, enabled
Norway to exercise and validate different aspects of its approach to
resilience, notably enhanced civil-military cooperation.173 Hybrid
warfare tabletop exercises developed by the Hybrid CoE, Finland's
National Defence Course for leaders in every sector, or Sweden's "total
defense" exercise174, are among initiatives that other Arctic states
could replicate. Such training and exercises should be conducted at the
national, regional, and international level so as to better counter
sub-threshold threats that can occur at different levels. Training and
exercising is an area where the EU-NATO cooperation could be deepened,
in order to complement and reinforce capabilities of both organizations.

6\. Crisis preparedness

Related to training and exercising is crisis preparedness. The
governments ought to enhance civilian preparedness and ensure that both
civilian authorities and citizens are familiar with different worst case
scenarios and know how to function in the event of a serious crisis
(e.g. a power outage, disruption of communications systems, etc.).
According to Elisabeth Braw, the public needs to be constantly updated
about prospective crises and how to prepare for them. "Thinking about
crises is not enjoyable, but COVID and the Ukraine War have painfully
demonstrated that thinking about events before they occur trumps having
to collectively improvise while the crises are occurring," Braw
writes.175 Sweden provides a good example to follow. In 2018, the
Swedish government sent every household a pamphlet titled "If Crisis or
War comes", with the aim to educate its citizens on how to function in
the event of an emergency -- be it caused by a cyber or terror attack,
natural disaster, disinformation campaign or any other crisis.176

7\. Break down silos and encourage horizontal coordination

Information sharing is still considered to be too vertical, with
different entities operating in "silos". Other limiting factors include
resource competition between governmental agencies, general lack of
trust between actors, and unclear administrative responsibilities at
times. What is more, hybrid threats are designed to make coordinated
countermeasures difficult.177 To strengthen a whole-of-government and
whole-of-society response to hybrid threats, it is important to break
down silos inside governments, between different government agencies,
between institutions, and between the government and the private sector.
Greater integration of military and non-military discussions on Arctic
vulnerabilities is equally important to better understand the extent to
which Arctic communities are exposed to harm

8\. Cooperate within coalitions and capitalize on existing frameworks

[Given the nature of hybrid threats, **it is essential to work across
agency boundaries** and geographical borders. Governments must recognize
the]{.underline} added [value of]{.underline} regional as well as
[international cooperation in dealing with Russian hybrid
operations]{.underline} -- rather than believing it is sufficient to
respond unilaterally -- and capitalize on existing frameworks. The JEF,
NORDEFCO, the EU and NATO already provide Western Arctic states with a
wide range of tools to respond to hybrid campaigns. [The sharing of best
practices]{.underline} (what has worked) [and lessons
learned]{.underline} (what needs improving) within existing frameworks
[is essential]{.underline}. [We need to deepen the
cooperation]{.underline} at the EU and NATO level, [between the EU and
NATO]{.underline}, as well as between public and private entities. It is
equally important that counter-hybrid responses at the local, national
and international level are well coordinated and optimized to
effectively address this challenge.

//DH

Despite the pressure of international sanctions and the war in Ukraine,
Russia has not abandoned its Arctic ambitions. On the contrary, [the
Kremlin has made the region a geopolitical priority]{.underline}. As
this paper has laid out, [it is **directing significant political
attention** and **financial resources** to Arctic
development]{.underline} that will yield results in years to come. Even
if these efforts remain plagued by structural inefficiencies,
corruption, intra-elite rivalries and the inherent difficulties of
operating in extreme climates, they will nonetheless expand Russia's
presence and capabilities in ways that directly threaten Western
security interests.

[Russia's Arctic posture under Patrushev, combined with America's
assertiveness, may create a new theatre of competition in a region where
Europe risks being sidelined or worse, caught in the middle. To avoid
being squeezed between two more aggressive actors, Europe's Arctic
states cannot afford to go it alone]{.underline}. Rather [they must work
together with the EU and other member states to anticipate this shift
and develop contingency strategies now]{.underline}. [This should
include strengthening cooperation with like-minded Arctic and non-Arctic
states]{.underline} and situating the Kremlin's approach within its
wider geopolitical strategy, most notably in Ukraine.

Strengthen cooperation with like-minded Arctic states

[The EU]{.underline} and European governments [should pursue greater
collaboration with Canada]{.underline}---a close ally that shares
European interests in sustainability and rules-based governance. [Such
collaboration could be especially useful in reinforcing Europeans' voice
and agency in Arctic diplomacy]{.underline}. To make this new
cooperation more impactful, the EU and its member states should broaden
their traditional agenda with Ottawa beyond climate and Indigenous
issues to include more defence policy. [The new Canadian government
which is more focused on Europe provides strong momentum.]{.underline}

[One way to deepen collaboration would be for the members of Nordic
Defence Cooperation]{.underline} (NORDEFCO)---[a framework that
currently includes Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden---to
push for Canada's partial inclusion]{.underline}. Or, at minimum, [they
could develop structured defence dialogues with Ottawa focused on
northern security, including more frequent joint patrols of Arctic
waters]{.underline}. Europeans should also consider publicly backing
Canada's legal position in its shelf demarcation dispute with America,
following Washington's unilateral claim in 2023. [A coordinated
EU--Canada approach could prevent both sides being sidelined in the
event of a US--Russia potential deal over the region's
future]{.underline}. [Such a deal might see Washington and Moscow renew
trade cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline} and support each other's
non-conflicting claims to the Arctic shelf, which would ignore both
European and Canadian interests.

In this context, [EU member states should deepen defence cooperation
with Greenland and Iceland, focusing on Arctic security through
frameworks like NORDEFCO, rather than relying solely on NATO, whose
cohesion is increasingly uncertain]{.underline}. Moreover, countries in
the GIUK gap (Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom) together with
EU partners should strengthen their joint capabilities, especially
because the corridor is used for detecting Russian naval and submarine
movements, and monitoring undersea infrastructure. To do so, a portion
of the EU's proposed €800bn defence package should be earmarked for
Arctic-specific initiatives, including infrastructure and surveillance
systems. Enhanced European engagement in the GIUK gap might also entice
the US as the area serves as a critical buffer against Russian maritime
activity.

JMP))

Towards a more credible EU Arctic strategy

So far, this CSDS Policy Brief has outlined the security challenges
facing the EU in the Arctic. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has altered
the EU's geopolitical stance, but there is a long way to go before the
EU can be called more than a diplomatic actor. So far, the [EU has not
yet established a specific and coordinated security policy for the
Arctic region]{.underline}. The [**lack of autonomous military capacity
has limited the EU's ability to influence the balance of power** in the
region.]{.underline} [EU interests range from **energy security** and
the **protection of trade routes** to **environmental sustainability**
and **cooperation with local communities**.]{.underline} The presence of
vast oil and gas reserves and the opening of new sea routes make the
Arctic crucial for diversifying European energy supplies, as well as
reducing transport times between Europe and Asia. For the Russian
economy, which is mainly based on trade in raw materials and
hydrocarbons, the supply of Arctic resources is undoubtedly a key
element, especially at this time of internal economic instability.
However, [the EU rightly watches the evolving regional dynamics with
concern, as this could mean possible future energy instability for
the]{.underline} nations of the [Union]{.underline}, especially if
bilateral relations with the Kremlin remain frosty.

[Russian militarisation]{.underline} and the expansion of military
capabilities along the Arctic coast [require a calibrated response from
the EU]{.underline}. Until now, [the EU's focus on diplomacy and
environmental cooperation]{.underline}, while important, [has not
adequately addressed the growing strategic competition]{.underline}.
Should the conflict in Ukraine end in the near future, [Sweden and
Finland can act as facilitators to integrate an Arctic security
dimension into the EU's approach]{.underline}, while [promoting a
multilateral dialogue to **prevent escalation**]{.underline}. The
presence of both Sweden and Finland in NATO could result in an increase
in the EU's military presence and legitimacy in the region. [The EU's
ability to influence regional stability depends on its success to act as
a mediator between the major powers]{.underline}. This posture, given
the breakdown in regional cooperation with Russia, it seems not yet
willing to take. Ideally, the [EU could position itself as an
**independent actor in the Arctic**, capable of promoting international
standards for the sustainable management of maritime resources and
shipping routes]{.underline}. However, it is impossible not to overlap
NATO's interests with those of the EU given the large number of common
members. Thus, excluding this hypothesis, one could reflect on the role
[the EU could]{.underline} play in [defus]{.underline}ing [tensions
between China and the US in the Arctic]{.underline}, along with
like-minded partners. We argue that the [EU is well-placed to try
this]{.underline}, although the approach is not without considerable
risks. Such cooperation is unlikely to prevent an alignment between
China and Russia on Arctic affairs, but the [EU's and China's common
interests in secure maritime trade routes could lower
tensions]{.underline}.

Despite the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), [the EU is not a
military alliance, but an expression of the cooperation of European
nations. This cooperation]{.underline}, however, [is limited regarding
security]{.underline}. In contrast, [security is theoretically
guaranteed by NATO]{.underline}, an expression of Western cooperation.
[However, the US clearly holds a dominant position within the
Alliance]{.underline}. This means that although the strategic interests
between the EU and NATO in the Arctic may be similar, they are not
entirely the same. Nowadays, for example, while war threatens the EU's
borders, [Trump's election]{.underline} in the US [highlights an
anti-interventionist stance, potentially weakening NATO's
relevance]{.underline}. In this respect, the [EU member states should
strive to **lower their dependency on the US in defence terms**. Arctic
security exemplifies the EU's security limitations, risking insufficient
competitiveness if NATO deems it non-essential given also the shift of
US strategic priorities towards the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. [Without
a more assertive posture by the EU in the Arctic, regional security will
depend on third-party management, **limiting the Union's independence
and bargaining power in political strategies**]{.underline}. [Weak
bargaining ties Europe to the US' willingness to employ deterrence,
which could]{.underline}, however, [turn out to be devalued]{.underline}
if other states know the US' posture. [A more **independent EU defence**
would better protect EU interests, **securing fair Arctic resource
access** and **enhancing mediation** through **independent deterrence
capabilities**. It would also help the EU **develop its own strategic
culture**, foster military-technological innovation and boost its
autonomy.]{.underline}

[The Arctic shows]{.underline}, much like the war in Ukraine, that
[there is a need for the **EU to**]{.underline} be able to **[formulate
and pursue its own goals without being overly dependent on
Washington]{.underline}**. To be clear, [the US will remain the EU's
main ally but it should not be overly dependent on Washington,
especially given]{.underline} recent signals by the [Trump]{.underline}
administration on Greenland and the broader Arctic region. A [military
role for the EU in the Arctic]{.underline} or elsewhere [means not only
potential active involvement in kinetic action, but also the ability to
monitor and protect critical infrastructures and **ensure credible
deterrence** against possible aggression or external
interference]{.underline}, and only then, possibly, [direct intervention
if necessary]{.underline}. In fact, exerting deterrence and pursuing
de-escalation in the Arctic could represent a shared goal for the EU and
NATO, should the US administration desire this. Either way, [European
nations must develop **independent technological capabilities** to
secure the EU's strategic interests in the Arctic region]{.underline}.
To this end, the [EU should prioritise region-specific surveillance and
defence technologies including underwater acoustic monitoring systems
and unmanned platforms]{.underline} (USV, UUV, UAV). [Such efforts would
allow the Europeans to track Russian movements]{.underline}, especially
near the Kola Peninsula, while safeguarding EU-funded and co-funded
connectivity projects in the Arctic like the North Pole Fiber and
Northern EU Gateways among others. Additionally, [investment in
Arctic-appropriate naval defence systems, such as patrol vessels and
icebreakers, would **secure trade routes**, **subsea cables** and
**enhance the EU's role as a stabilising force**]{.underline}.

ZP

It was not on any 2025 predictions list. Donald Trump, former real
estate mogul and soon-to-be 47th president of the United States, has
begun the year by setting his sights on buying Greenland, supposedly for
the "purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world." To
the shock of his European counterparts -- [the president-elect has
even refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire
Greenland.]{.underline}

Both Denmark's and Greenland's prime ministers, along with
other European leaders, have spoken out against Trump's overtures. They
are right to be worried. Trump's attempts to purchase Greenland, an
autonomous territory of Denmark, suggest the incoming president thinks
Europeans can be walked all over. [He seems to believe that Europeans
are so dependent on the United States that the US president can simply
demand that they sell him any mineral-rich or strategic territory he
desires. If Europeans don't stand up to this geopolitical bullying, it
will not be his last demand.]{.underline}

The president-elect claims to be concerned about Greenland's defence, so
[Europeans need to show that they can both **defend Greenland and the
Arctic themselves**]{.underline} and that the region can only be secure
with transatlantic cooperation.

To make this argument, [Europeans]{.underline} first [need to **increase
their own investments in Arctic defence**.]{.underline} Between Trump's
Truth Social posts, Denmark's defence minister has [already announced a
plan to bolster Greenland's defence]{.underline} by around a billion
euros, acknowledging the Arctic will be a crucial geopolitical
battleground. [European allies should support these financial efforts to
bolster's Greenland's defence, as well as the **defence of the entire
Arctic**.]{.underline} In particular, [Europeans should work with
Greenlanders to invest in more robust maritime defence capabilities and
ensuring economic security]{.underline} in the region.

This is not the first time Trump has said he wants to purchase
Greenland, and he is not the first US president to try (Truman made an
offer in the 1940s). Trump's fixation is not as misguided as it sounds.
[The resource-rich island has played an important role in Arctic issues
and will become an even more important geopolitical actor as climate
change reshapes the region.]{.underline}

Denmark and Greenland are approaching Trump's sales technique
differently this time around. The Danish prime minister has used a
rather conciliatory tone and has not called it "absurd" as she did in
2019. In fact, both Denmark and Greenland have emphasised the US as a
strategic partner. Ultimately, if Trump did use military force against
Greenland he would by extension, be attacking Denmark and thus a NATO
ally. The [spectacle of NATO's core member using force against one of
its weaker allies to seize territory would terminally weaken the
alliance. But it is an **empty threat as long as Europeans stand up the
bully** about to enter the White House.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the [Arctic attracts the attention of many actors in the
international arena, who are ready to fight for its]{.underline} hidden
rich natural [resources]{.underline} and opportunities for economic
enrichment. Among them are the Russian and Chinese governments, which
use their own mechanisms to achieve regional strategic goals. Therefore,
[world leaders must find a way to prevent new conflicts and tensions in
the Arctic and agree on a consensus on the distribution of the Arctic
space using a **strategy of mutually beneficial
cooperation**]{.underline}. Also, [to **secure its influence** in the
Arctic region and **avoid confrontation with other interested parties**,
the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[must continue using its soft power and invest in different
initiatives]{.underline}. Lastly, [the EU and NATO must pay great

[The EU is predominantly a soft power in the region]{.underline}. Hence,
[it should not pursue hard military objectives in the Arctic as it
simply does not possess these capabilities]{.underline}. This should be
left to NATO. [Rather, the EU could channel its existing instruments to

Today, [President of the European Commission]{.underline} Ursula von der
Leyen [is in Greenland to inaugurate the EU Office in Nuuk -- Europe\'s
concrete presence in Greenland and in the wider Arctic
region.]{.underline}

Together with Prime Minister of Greenland Múte Bourup Egede, and in the
presence of Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen, President von
der Leyen [signed two cooperation agreements totalling almost €94
million]{.underline}, under Global Gateway, [the EU investment
strategy]{.underline} for the world. These [will bring investments in
education and skills on the island and support the clean energy
transition]{.underline}.

President von der Leyen said: \"[Our new office in Nuuk marks the
beginning of a new era of the EUGreenland partnership]{.underline}, with
Europe\'s concrete [presence in Greenland and in the wider Arctic
region]{.underline}. And with our two new agreements, we will invest in
clean energy, critical raw materials and skills in Greenland. **[New
jobs in Greenland, better security of supply for Europe; we can both
benefit from greater cooperation in these areas.\"]{.underline}**

[The opening of an EU Office in Nuuk is part of the EU\'s Arctic
strategy]{.underline}. It [will facilitate collaboration between the
EU]{.underline} and the government, the private sector and civil
society, promote EU public a[nd private investments in Greenland and
deepen cooperation]{.underline} across a variety of fields, including
education, renewable energy, critical raw materials and biodiversity
protection.

The €71.25 million Education programme will further improve the quality
of [Greenland\'s education sector to empower]{.underline} the youth and
provide the Greenland [workforce with the skills needed for strategic
economic sectors.]{.underline} The focus of this cooperation agreement
is on vocational and technical education, innovative skills in primary
education, and helping young Greenlanders who are not in education or
employment to find their way back into schooling or work.

The €22.5 million Green Growth programme, the second cooperation
agreement signed today, **[will invest in energy and critical raw
materials value chains, environmental preservation, and research, to
help diversify Greenland\'s economy]{.underline}** and develop strategic
industries like clean hydrogen.

Greenland\'s status as an EU Overseas Country and Territory (OCT)
underlines its unique relationship with the EU. In the period 2021-2027,
Greenland benefits from €225 million from the EU in support of
sustainable development, education and green growth sectors, including
the €94 million signed today.

President von der Leyen\'s visit highlights the EU\'s commitment to
invest in a sustainable, prosperous, and peaceful Arctic region. The
Memorandum of Understanding on critical raw materials, signed in
November 2023, [reflects the shared commitment to sustainable
resource]{.underline} [development and positions Greenland as a
strategic supplier]{.underline} of raw materials for Europe\'s green
transition.

[The Global Gateway strategy is the EU\'s offer to partner countries in
support of their resilience and sustainable development.]{.underline}
[This offer aims at]{.underline} narrowing the global investment gap
with value-driven investments from public and private sectors,
[**supporting global economic recovery** and accompanying the twin green
and digital transitions outside the EU]{.underline}. Across the world,
Global Gateway aims to mobilise €300 billion in investments between 2021
and 2027 with a mix of grants, concessional loans and guarantees to
de-risk private sector investments.

[Greenland has allowed a Danish-French consortium to mine a rock which
is key to the production of aluminum.]{.underline}

The [permit granted to Greenland Anorthosite Mining (GAM) to **extract
anorthosite**]{.underline} follows interest in the Arctic territory from
U.S. President Donald Trump in acquiring the autonomous island which is
part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

GAM, which is backed by French company Jean Boulle Group and real estate
investment firms bodies from Denmark and Greenland, was granted a
30-year permit, Reuters reported.

Jesper Willaing Zeuthen, associate professor at Aalborg University, in
Denmark, told Newsweek Trump\'s interest in Greenland\'s resources is
likely to be more in securing long-term investment objects which is
difficult under current Greenlandic legislation.

When contacted for comment, the U.S. National Security Council (NSC)
told Newsweek the U.S. \"is ready to further expand our partnership with
Greenland on economic, cultural, and security issues.\"

Why It Matters

[Greenland]{.underline} has sparked international attention since
President Trump expressed his interest in acquiring the Arctic island
[rich in minerals, oil and natural gas]{.underline}.

[Greenland\'s Mineral Resources Minister]{.underline} Naaja Nathanielsen
[said that **U.S. interest in the island has not resulted in any
investment** and the deal signals that **business dialog with European
partners** was **progressing** more **quickly**.]{.underline}

What To Know

Greenland Anorthosite Mining (GAM) was granted permission to extract
anorthosite, a white rock composed mainly of aluminum, micro silica, and
calcium. The firm plans to ship crushed anorthosite from the west of
Greenland for use by the fiberglass industry.

In announcing the 30-year permit, Greenland\'s Mineral Resources
Minister Naaja Nathanielsen said the goal was to scale the project to
become a climate-friendly alternative to bauxite in producing aluminum
for aircraft, vehicles and defense.

She said that private U.S. business delegations had visited the island
this year but despite the rhetoric from the Trump administration, [no
formal dialogue with the new U.S. administration had started nor brought
about an increased interest in direct investment. Cooperation with both
the EU]{.underline} and Denmark [was progressing more
smoothly]{.underline}, she added.

### Solves -- Minerals

#### EU can empirically cooperate with Greenland to unlock sustainable access to critical minerals

Today in Brussels the [EU signed a Memorandum of
Understanding]{.underline} (MoU) [with the Government of
Greenland]{.underline} [for a strategic partnership to develop
sustainable raw materials value chains]{.underline}.

Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, Interinstitutional

[Greenland\'s extensive natural riches are a major asset for reaping the
benefits of global value chains]{.underline}, as it seeks to diversify
its economy in a sustainable way. [25 of the 34 critical raw materials
identified by the Commission as strategically important for Europe\'s
industry and the green transition can be found in
Greenland]{.underline}.

of]{.underline} sustainable projects along [the raw materials value
chains, and to the deployment of infrastructure required to develop
them.]{.underline}

The [European Union (**EU**) is **eyeing Greenland as** a key

raw material value chains and reduce reliance on China**]{.underline}.

[The bloc signed a Memorandum of Understanding]{.underline} (MoU) with

cooperation that seeks to [develop Greenland's mining sector in a manner
that **adheres to** the **EU's sustainability standards**]{.underline}.

"Given the geostrategic interests and the battery mineral endowments in
Greenland, it makes sense for the EU to deepen the raw material and
geopolitical relationship with Greenland," said Bryan Bille, principal
policy analyst at Benchmark.

As an autonomous Danish territory, Greenland is not part of the EU and
possesses autonomy over domestic affairs such as mineral exploration and
extraction rights. [Denmark]{.underline}, meanwhile, [retains rights
over the territory's foreign policy and defence.]{.underline}

The [EU Commission]{.underline} opened an office in Greenland's capital,
Nuuk, in March 2024, simultaneously [launching a Green Growth program to
invest €22.5 million in energy and critical raw materials value chains
in the region.]{.underline}

"Despite some progress, we haven't yet seen a roadmap since the MoU was
signed in November last year, although the two sides intended to agree
on one within six months," Bille added.

Greenland's critical raw material potential

A 2023 reported published by the Geological Survey of Denmark and
Greenland (GEUS) recognised that [**25 of** the **34** of the minerals
covered under the European Comission's 'critical raw materials' were
present in Greenland]{.underline}, including significant endowments of
[**battery mineral**s such as graphite and lithium, as well as the
**rare earth elements** (REE) utilised in clean technologies such as
electric vehicles and wind turbines.]{.underline}

GEUS identified 6 Mt of known natural graphite resources, 36.1 Mt of
known REE resources, 235kt of known lithium resources, and 106kt of
known copper resources.

Despite its rich geology, the region is an under-developed mining
jurisdiction and is not projected to contribute meaningful supply in the
short-to-medium term.

The only project tracked by Benchmark is the Kvanefjeld REE mine, which
was closed in 2021 after the Greenlandic parliament passed a law banning
uranium mining and exploration -- a by-product of REE mining --
following local protests

Aside from the potential for local pushback, the development of mining
projects in Greenland will also be challenging due to its remoteness,
harsh climate, limited workforce, and lack of infrastructure. The EU
will need to assist in alleviating some of these barriers to entry if it
hopes to attract private investment for large-scale mining operations in
the region.

But Greenland does offer a stable political climate and a broadly
pro-mining government keen to diversify its economy -- making it a more
attractive partner compared to some other resource-rich nations.

Greenland and the geopolitics of the Arctic

The [EU's motivation for deepening economic and political ties with
Greenland also lie in a desire to **anchor** the **island's** **economy
towards Europe** and away from China and Russia]{.underline}, amidst
intensifying geopolitical competition in the Arctic region.

An independence movement in Greenland has steadily gained momentum in
recent years, with the government presenting a first draft of a
constitution in 2023. The possibility of full autonomy from Denmark
poses several economic and security implications for the EU and its
allies, while also adding risk for potential mining investments in the
region.

"The geopolitics involved could make future mining investments more
risky and complex. Hence, the [importance of the EU-Greenland strategic
partnership, which should be aimed at derisking these
investments]{.underline}," Bille said

As [polar ice caps continue to disappear, new opportunities for resource
extraction and emerging trade routes in the Arctic]{.underline} are
enhancing Greenland's strategic importance as a gateway to the region.

[China]{.underline} has previously [expressed interest in Greenland's
raw material resources]{.underline}, pledging to build a "Polar Silk
Road" -- although China has failed as yet to gain a significant foothold
in the region. [Russia]{.underline}, meanwhile, is [increasingly
asserting its military presence in the Arctic region]{.underline}, with
regional cooperation all but disappearing following the full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

[Greenland]{.underline}, therefore, [sits at the intersection of several
overlapping strands of geopolitical competition and the EU will hope it
can use bilateral cooperation to strengthen its position in the
region]{.underline}.

Policy developments in the EU, including recent election results, will
play a key role in shaping European critical mineral and battery
industries.

### Solves -- Sustainable Mining

#### EU mining agreements place a strong emphasis on [environmental sustainability]{.underline} -- mining could produce pollution that harms fishing industry

**Vaillant, 24** (November 14, 2024, Tom Vaillant is a staff video and
visual journalist for 20 Minuten, a Swiss newspaper, "Greenland's Rare
Earths Attract European and U.S. Interest, Signaling Potential Mining
Boon," https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/greenlands-rare-earths-attract-european-and-us-interest-signaling-potential-mining-boom)

Ice floes block the fjords, especially in winter

[One major obstacle is Greenland's harsh climate]{.underline}. The
northern coastline is blanketed in sea ice for much of the year, which
makes extraction prohibitively costly. \"[It\'s far too expensive
there]{.underline},\" says Christiansen. Southern Greenland, where
ice-free fjords open in summer, has conditions similar to Norway.

Yet even in the south, ice floes obstruct transport during winter,
necessitating on-site storage solutions. Christiansen notes that climate
change will ease access over time as the ice recedes.

\"We know that [Greenland has potential to offer key resources such as
rare earths]{.underline},\" says Florian Vidal, a political scientist
from the Arctic University of Norway. But unlocking this potential will
require investment and skilled personnel, he adds. \"This will be the
biggest challenge for Greenland over the coming decade.\"

In theory, Greenland has sufficient workers to support the mining
activities. However, multiple airports are currently being built across
the island, and are drawing from the same labor pool, Christiansen
notes. Thus, some employees for the mines, or at least for their initial
construction, would need to come from abroad, he says.

[Environmental concerns are also significant. Expanding mining
activities could increase pollution risks, not only at the mines but
also due to the added shipping traffic in Greenland's
fjords,]{.underline} where fishing is a vital industry. \"There are
concerns in the fjords and among the fishermen,\" says Vidal.

[The EU's mining agreement with Greenland\'s government places
a **strong emphasis on sustainability**]{.underline}. Under the terms of
the pact, [resource extraction will proceed only under **stringent
environmental conditions**.]{.underline}

#### The EU is best aligned for Greenland's interests -- protects environment and indigenous groups

GRR

[Greenland]{.underline} may [become over-politicised as US-China rivalry
is increasingly mirrored in resource diplomacy, while the EU acts as a
normative power pushing environmental safeguards,]{.underline} says US
academic Hong Nong.

Once seen as a remote Arctic wilderness, Greenland has emerged as a
geopolitical hotspot in the 21st century[. Beneath its icy terrain lies
a trove of critical minerals]{.underline} --- rare earth elements,
uranium, zinc and nickel --- [key to powering the green energy
transition and high-tech industries.]{.underline}

As the [climate warms and ice retreats, global powers are racing to
secure access to these resources. The US, China, and the EU have all
staked political, economic and strategic claims on Greenland's
future]{.underline}. But their competing approaches not only shape
Greenland's mining landscape --- they also carry profound implications
for Arctic governance, economic development, great power rivalry and
Greenland's path toward greater autonomy.

Greenlandic authorities responded to public concerns about radioactive
waste while signalling wariness of growing Chinese influence.

The mineral wealth beneath the ice

[Greenland's geological makeup positions it as a future leader in the
supply of critical raw materials]{.underline}. According to the
Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), the [island is home
to significant reserves of rare earth elements (REEs]{.underline}),
uranium, zinc, iron ore and niobium.

The [Kvanefjeld project]{.underline} in southern Greenland, originally
led by Greenland Minerals Ltd. and backed by Chinese interests via
Shenghe Resources, was [set to become one of the world's largest REE and
uranium mines.]{.underline} However, in 2021, Greenland's [new
government banned uranium mining, effectively halting Kvanefjeld's
development.]{.underline}

This [decision was both environmental and political. Greenlandic
authorities responded to public concerns about radioactive waste while
signalling wariness of growing Chinese influence. Yet the appetite for
mining remains strong.]{.underline} Greenland has issued dozens of
exploration licenses, and new projects --- like zinc mining in Citronen
Fjord or rare earth prospecting in Sarfartoq --- continue to attract
international interest.

US policy: security-driven investment

[The US has taken a strategic approach to Greenland's
resources]{.underline}, viewing them through the lens of national
security and supply chain resilience. In 2019, President Donald Trump
famously floated the idea of purchasing Greenland --- a move dismissed
as absurd by many, but underscoring Washington's deepening interest in
the island. The same year, the US signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with Greenland to support sustainable mineral resource
development. The next year, the US reopened its consulate in Nuuk and
launched initiatives through the Department of State and US Geological
Survey to support mining partnerships.

Through the Defense Production Act and the Industrial Base Analysis and
Sustainment (IBAS) program, the US Department of Defence (DoD) began
funding rare earth supply chains free of Chinese involvement ---
including those potentially based in Greenland. These efforts aimed to
secure critical materials for the defence and technology sectors and
reduce dependency on China-dominated supply chains.

However, [developments under the last two US administrations suggest a
cooling of the relationship]{.underline}. Greenland's Minister for
Business and Mineral Resources Naaja Nathanielsen noted that the MOU on
mineral cooperation signed during [Donald Trump's first term has
expired]{.underline}, and [efforts to renew it under President Joe Biden
were unsuccessful. In May 2025, she criticised Trump's renewed
suggestion that the US might acquire Greenland, calling it
"disrespectful and distasteful". Her remarks reflect a broader sentiment
in Greenland that US engagement in mining should be grounded in equal
partnership and respect for Greenlandic sovereignty.]{.underline}

This reflects Nuuk's realist approach to foreign engagement --- China
remains a viable partner, provided it adheres to Greenland's conditions,
including respect for sovereignty, environmental safeguards, and
transparency.

China's cautious yet persistent presence

[China has long eyed Greenland as part of its Arctic economic
strategy]{.underline}. Its 2018 Arctic Policy White Paper declared China
as "Arctic stakeholder" and highlighted scientific research,
infrastructure, energy and mineral development as key interests. Chinese
firms, such as Shenghe Resources and China National Nuclear Corporation
(CNNC), have attempted to invest in Greenlandic mining, notably in the
Kvanefjeld and Isua Iron Ore Project Mine.

[However, these efforts have encountered political headwinds.
Greenland's 2021 uranium ban was widely interpreted as a rebuke to
Chinese involvement. In 2019, Danish intelligence reportedly warned that
China sought to establish dual-use infrastructure in Greenland that
could serve strategic or military purposes.]{.underline} This has
increased Western wariness about Chinese investment.

Nonetheless, China remains engaged in Greenland. Its firms continue to
hold minority stakes in certain projects and explore partnerships.
Beijing's global Belt and Road Initiative and growing Arctic diplomacy
make Greenland a continued focal point for resource diplomacy. As global
demand for REEs intensifies, China may recalibrate its strategy ---
balancing commercial interest with lower-profile engagement to avoid
geopolitical friction.

Despite these constraints, [Greenland has signalled a pragmatic openness
to Chinese investment, warning that "if the US and EU do not act, we may
turn to Chinese investment".]{.underline} This reflects Nuuk's realist
approach to foreign engagement --- China remains a viable partner,
provided it adheres to Greenland's conditions, including respect for
sovereignty, environmental safeguards, and transparency.

[Greenland welcomed the EU's initiative, but Nathanielsen noted that the
bloc has yet to translate its intentions into tangible
investments]{.underline}.

The EU's green demand and regulatory leverage

[The EU pursues a different path --- leveraging rules and norms to
project soft power. Its 2020 Critical Raw Materials Action Plan and 2023
Critical Raw Materials Act aim to diversify and secure sustainable
mineral supplies. Greenland, with its close historical ties to Denmark,
is seen as a key non-Chinese source of rare earths in the EU's strategic
calculus.]{.underline}

Unlike the US security-driven model, [the EU emphasises environmental
protection, corporate social responsibility and Indigenous
consultation.]{.underline} The 2023 EU-Greenland MOU on Sustainable Raw
Materials Value Chains outlines cooperation on feasibility studies,
environmental assessments, and local stakeholder engagement.

Greenland welcomed the EU's initiative, but Nathanielsen noted that the
bloc has yet to translate its intentions into tangible investments. What
Greenland [needs,]{.underline} she stressed, are [real partners --- not
just verbal commitments.]{.underline}

Geopolitical and environmental implications

Greenland's mining politics encapsulate broader Arctic shifts. As great
powers increase their economic footprints, the island becomes a proxy
arena for strategic competition. US-China rivalry is increasingly
mirrored in resource diplomacy, while [the EU acts as a normative power
pushing environmental safeguards.]{.underline}

This dynamic raises two concerns. First, Greenland may become
over-politicised. As its autonomy within the Kingdom of Denmark grows,
Nuuk seeks to chart its own economic path. Yet external pressure risks
reducing Greenlandic agency, especially if caught in US-China tension.

Second, the rush for minerals could undermine Arctic environmental
standards. Greenland's melting ice already symbolises global climate
change. [Without stringent safeguards, mining expansion could threaten
fragile ecosystems and Indigenous livelihoods]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, there is also an opportunity. [If managed transparently,
mining could fuel Greenland's economic self-reliance, support global
green energy goals and demonstrate that Arctic resource development need
not be a zero-sum game]{.underline}. This would require cooperation
among major powers, respect for Greenlandic self-rule, and a clear
regulatory framework --- something that may prove elusive in today's
fractured global order.

The [international community must support sustainable development that
centres Greenlandic priorities, ensures environmental protections, and
fosters transparency.]{.underline}

signed strategic partnership on sustainable raw materials value chain"
European Commission, 11/29,
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166 //AL

This MoU establishes close cooperation between Greenland and the EU in
the following five areas:

**Economic and industrial integration of value chains for Critical Raw
Materials and other raw materials.** This includes [networking,
developing projects]{.underline} jointly, [creating and promoting new
business models, attracting investments, supporting access to finance,
facilitating trade linkages, developing and integrating support for
economic diversification, and ensuring the well-functioning and
resilience of these value chains.]{.underline}

**Cooperation to leverage high international environmental, social and
governance (ESG) standards,** to ensure that Greenland\'s minerals
sector is a lever for sustainable and inclusive economic growth with
local and domestic value creation. This includes [sustainable
exploitation of mineral resources in close dialogue with the Greenlandic
society]{.underline} -- individuals, organisations, enterprises and
other stakeholders - taking fully into account the unique nature of
Greenland\'s pristine lands, and [applying high ESG standards set out in
legislation, agreements, guidelines and best practices]{.underline}.

**Deployment of infrastructure required for the development of raw
material value chains. **This includes taking into consideration the
specificities of Greenland\'s transport and energy infrastructure needs,
subject to Arctic or subarctic conditions, and [supporting the
mobilisation of funding for this infrastructure.]{.underline}

**Strengthening of capacities and skills development along raw materials
value chains.** This includes developing skills at all levels in the raw
materials industry and wider society.

**[Cooperation on research and innovation]{.underline}** and [sharing of
knowledge and technologies related to sustainable exploration,
extraction, processing and refining of raw materials]{.underline}.
Greenland is eligible for participation in the EU Framework Programme
for Research and Innovation, and Earth Observation Data and Copernicus
present [promising opportunities with relevance for mineral exploration,
i.e. mapping of deposits, monitoring of mining including waste
management, and monitoring of environmental impact.]{.underline}

European Commission, 11/29,
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166 //AL

The partnership signed today offers benefits to both parties. [It
ensures that Greenland\'s resources serve to underpin sustainable, fair
and inclusive socioeconomic development following the strictest ESG
standards]{.underline}. It simultaneously [enables the EU to deliver on
its ambitious Green Deal]{.underline}, empowering the green and digital
transitions in both regions.

[The EU needs to secure a sustainable supply of raw materials,
especially critical raw materials, as an essential prerequisite for
delivering on green and clean energy objectives]{.underline}. As part of
the action plan for Critical Raw
Materials[\[1\]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/#_ftn1) and
the Critical Raw Materials
Act[\[2\]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/#_ftn2) [the EU
commits to develop strategic international partnerships and associated
funding with resource-rich countries such as Greenland to secure a
diversified and sustainable supply of critical raw
materials.]{.underline}

[The Commission has already established strategic partnerships on raw
materials with Canada]{.underline} (June 2021), [Ukraine]{.underline}
(July 2021), [Kazakhstan and Namibia]{.underline} (November 2022),
[Argentina]{.underline} (June 2023), [Chile]{.underline} (July 2023),
[and Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo]{.underline} (October
2023) on behalf of the EU. The [partnerships allow both sides to advance
trade and investments into a secure, sustainable and resilient raw
materials value chain]{.underline}, which is key to achieving the
transition to climate-neutral and digitalised economies. The
partnerships are in line with the Global Gateway strategy, the EU\'s key
initiative for investments for sustainable and high-quality projects in
the world, taking into account the needs of partner countries and
ensuring lasting benefits for local communities, and through which Team
Europe will mobilise up to €300 billion.

[The high resource potential in Greenland combined with EU\'s demand for
minerals and its expertise in prospecting, exploration, extraction,
processing and refining, makes a solid base for the
Partnership]{.underline} and supports the development of Greenland\'s
mineral resource sector as a future supplier of raw materials to the EU.

### Solves -- Greenland Wants EU Investment 

#### Greenland wants EU investment in education, climate, and raw materials 

**Vestergaard Hviid 24** \[Hanna Vestergaard Hviid, \"Press conference
before opening of new EU office: Here are the most important points\",
3/15/24, KNR,
https://knr.gl/da/nyheder/pressemoede-foer-aabning-af-nyt-eu-kontor-her-er-de-vigtigste-punkter\]

Today, the president of naalakkersuisut Múte B. [Egede opened the new EU
office in Nuuk]{.underline} together with the president of the European
Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.

Before they cut the blue ribbon in front of the gray building that will
house Greenland\'s contact with the EU, [there was a press
conference]{.underline} at Hans Egede\'s House in Nuuk. Múte B. Egede,
Ursula von der Leyen and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen were
present.

[The main points]{.underline} from all three of them [were climate,
education and raw materials.]{.underline}

Greenland and the EU have just signed a new agreement of 71 million
euros -- around 529 million kroner -- for education.

The [EU is already the second largest contributor to Greenland\'s
economy]{.underline}. According to this year\'s Finance Act, the EU
contributes over 250 million kroner to the country\'s economy.

According to Ursula von der Leyen, [the money will be used to strengthen
further education and retraining.]{.underline}

\- Basic education is important, but it is equally important to retrain
people for the areas where they are needed, she says during the press
conference.

Climate change was also a hot topic at the press conference.

It was mentioned how [Greenland is one of the places where you can
really see the consequences of climate change.]{.underline}

And that the [EU and Greenland have just signed an agreement worth 22
million euros]{.underline} - around 164 million kroner - [on green
growth.]{.underline}

 Urusla von der Leyen spoke about how [Greenland has the opportunity to
become climate neutra]{.underline}l because a large part of our
electricity network runs on hydroelectric power.

\- With the right investments, **[Greenland can not only become climate
neutral but even climate positive]{.underline}**, says the President of
the European Commission.

According to her, Greenland could end up exporting clean energy. And
**[the EU would really like to cooperate with Greenland]{.underline}**
on this.

The last major topic at the meeting was raw materials.

Both Ursula von der Leyen and Mette Frederiksen emphasized how important
raw materials are for Europe and that they hope that it is possible to
form cooperation with Greenland.

[Greenland possesses 25 out of the 34 raw materials that the EU has
categorized as strategically important.]{.underline}

Muté B. Egede also touched on the topic, making it clear that
**[Greenland welcomes the EU to invest in raw materials.]{.underline}**

But if they\'re not interested, there are probably others who will be.

\- Interest (in raw materials, ed.) is growing rapidly. Everyone in the
world needs to invest in this area, says the chairman of the Greenlandic
government.

However, he emphasizes that Greenland has strict regulations regarding
the extraction of raw materials.

It was repeatedly said at the meeting that the **[EU and Greenland are
like-minded]{.underline}**. Mette Frederiksen also brought up that she
believes that Greenland and Denmark are like-minded countries.

\- There are no conflicts between [Greenland and Denmark]{.underline}
today. We [have been successful in building a more **equal and
respectful cooperation**]{.underline}. **[We trust each
other,]{.underline}** says the Prime Minister.

Ursula von der Leyen believes that [**the opening of the new EU office
signals a new era** in which the Arctic has gained even greater
importance.]{.underline}

\"Greenland has always been part of the European family. That\'s why
I\'m happy to open the European office in Nuuk,\" she says.

\"It\'s more than bricks and mortar. It\'s the start of a new period of
EU presence in Greenland and the Arctic,\" says Ursula von der Leyen.

### Solves -- Prevents Chinese influence in Greenland

#### EU investment can prevent Greenland from turning to China

**Harcic, 25** -- A news outlet that reports on international affairs,
particularly in areas like international economies, technological
advancements, agriculture, and industries. "Greenland warns EU and US:
Invest in mining or China will" Harici, 5/27,
https://harici.com.tr/en/greenland-warns-eu-and-us-invest-in-mining-or-china-will/
// GRR

Greenland's Minister of Business and Mineral Resources, Naaja
Nathanielsen, signaled to the Financial Times that [Greenland might turn
to China for mining if the EU and US "do not hurry."]{.underline}

Nathanielsen stated, "We want to develop and diversify our business
sector, and for that, we need external investments." When asked about
turning to China, Nathanielsen responded that they want to cooperate
with European and American partners, but if they do not come, "[it will
be necessary to look elsewhere."]{.underline}

Western companies are showing increased interest in the Arctic island.
United Airlines will begin flights from New York to the capital, Nuuk,
starting next month. Greenland possesses large but difficult-to-access
mineral deposits, such as gold and copper, and is located in a
geopolitically crucial Arctic region.

Nathanielsen mentioned that the existing memorandum of understanding on
mining development with the US, signed during Donald Trump's first
presidency, is about to expire. She added that Greenland unsuccessfully
attempted to see if Washington wanted to renew it during the Biden
administration.

The Greenlandic official added, "[We had hoped the Trump administration
would be more willing to engage in dialogue with Greenland on developing
the mineral sector. We got a bit more than we asked for, because we
don't want to become American]{.underline}."

On the other hand, [Nathanielsen]{.underline} told the FT that she
[found Trump's threats to acquire Greenland "disrespectful and
unpleasant."]{.underline}

Despite Trump's rhetoric, Nathanielsen noted that China has not shown
much interest in mining deals. She said there are currently only two
Chinese mining companies in Greenland, but both are minority
shareholders in inactive projects, and she [speculated that Chinese
investors are holding back because they "do not want to cause any
provocation.]{.underline}"

The Greenlandic official's comments came as the country celebrated
granting the first license under its new mining law to a Danish-French
group to extract anorthosite, a mineral used in the fiberglass industry.

According to Claus Stoltenborg, CEO of Greenland Anorthosite Mining,
construction of the €150 million mining project in West Greenland is
targeted to begin next year. The company's backers include Greenland's
state pension fund, the Danish bank Arbejdernes Landsbank, and the
French mining group Jean Boulle.

While only two mines producing gold and anorthosite are currently active
in Greenland, two other mines that have received licenses have not yet
begun production.

Nathanielsen said that the new four-party coalition government in Nuuk
is "committed to ensuring development primarily for Greenland and
Greenlanders" and would [prefer to work with "allies and like-minded
partners]{.underline}," but added that [Greenland is "struggling to keep
up" in the changing Western alliance.]{.underline}

Nathanielsen asked, "[We are trying to understand what the new world
order will be. In this respect, Chinese investments are of course
problematic, but to some extent, so are American
investments]{.underline}. Because what is the purpose \[of US
investments\]?"

Nathanielsen added that [the EU is "suitable" for Greenland because the
EU has very few of the minerals it needs and is also aligned on
environmental criteria]{.underline}.

### Solves -- Greenland Security 

#### EU membership for Greenland will provide economic and geopolitical protection. 

Seb **Starcevic 25-** Seb Starcevic is a Breaking News Reporter at
POLITICO based in Brussels. \[ \"Greenland should consider rejoining hte
EU for \'protection,\' Danish MEP says\", 1/29/25, Politico,
https://www.politico.eu/article/greenland-should-rejoin-the-eu-denmark-mep-morten-lokkegaard-says/\]
EP

[Greenland should consider rejoining the European Union for "protection"
in the face of U.S.]{.underline} President Donald Trump's threats to
acquire the Arctic island, Danish MEP Morten Løkkegaard said Wednesday.

While [Løkkegaard said Greenland's future was ultimately for
Greenlanders to decide]{.underline}, he argued [it was time for "some
kind of new thinking."]{.underline}

"We live in a world where [no matter how independent you want to be, you
have to be a member of alliances,]{.underline}" Løkkegaard said. "[And
to my mind, the EU is the best alliance you can get into. That goes for
Denmark, that goes for Greenland."]{.underline}

[Being part of the EU would ensure Greenland has
"protection]{.underline}," he added. "[In a common society, you are
secured economically and politically."]{.underline}

Trump has said it is an "absolute necessity" for the U.S. to gain
control of Greenland and has refused to rule out using military force to
acquire the island. His increasingly aggressive overtures have sparked
crisis talks in Copenhagen and other European capitals, with Danish
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dashing between Berlin, Brussels and
Paris this week to shore up support.

Greenland, a self-ruling Danish territory, voted in a referendum to
leave the European Communities, a precursor to the EU, in 1982 and
formally left the bloc in 1985 --- though most of its roughly 60,000
citizens are Danish and therefore still EU citizens.

["Clearly the situation has changed dramatically since '85]{.underline}.
[We have a completely different geopolitical situation right
now,]{.underline}" Løkkegaard, who hails from the Renew group in the
European Parliament, told POLITICO from Greenland, where he is visiting
as part of a delegation from the centrist group.

Greenland has a strong independence movement, with Prime Minister Múte
Egede calling for the island to separate from Denmark. "We don't want to
be Danes. We don't want to be Americans. We want to be Greenlanders," he
told reporters earlier this month.

[Løkkegaard argued Greenland is a natural candidate for EU
membership,]{.underline} with a strong democracy and welfare system.
"[Many of the values that the EU member states and the EU population
stand for are totally in line with the values of
Greenland]{.underline}," he said.

An unintended benefit of Trump's saber-rattling was that [Greenland
could "reopen the discussion \[as to\] whether they consider closer
relations with Europe]{.underline}," including "a new understanding on a
common future," Løkkegaard said.

"If you want political change, this just might be the kick that is
necessary for the Greenlanders to have a fresh look at what happens in
Europe," he added.

### U -- EU Prioritizing Arctic 

#### EU is prioritizing security and environmental challenges in the Arctic

Christian **Blanco**, 3/05/20**24** \-\-- Permanent Secretariat,

https://finabel.org/eus-presence-in-the-arctic/2, SKR

[The EU presence in the Arctic region is acquiring decisive importance
in terms of security and defence, especially since the escalation of the
Russo-Ukrainian war.]{.underline} However, not only geopolitical
rivalries are an important change, but also the opportunism of the
effect of global warming and the increase in commercial interest in
natural resources. [The joint communication of 2021]{.underline},
October 13, [A stronger EU engagement for a peaceful, sustainable and
prosperous Arctic, proposed that the EU pursue a secure, stable,
sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous Arctic region. There is a need to
adopt a strengthened maritime security policy, especially in the areas
of economic development, free trade, transport, and energy
security]{.underline}. [The Strategic Compass of 2021]{.underline},
March 21, [foresaw that the EU in the Arctic will fight]{.underline} in
the coming decades [against climate change, natural disasters and
environmental degradation, in addition to]{.underline} the
intensification of [geopolitical competition and tensions also in terms
of resources and transportation routes]{.underline} (Council of the EU,
2021). In this regard, the EU Council published in its Conclusions of
2021, March 8, that close cooperation was required with partner
countries, the international organisations involved (i.e. the UN) and
multilateral partnerships.

On February 28, 2024, [EU defence and security in the Arctic is becoming
a priority.]{.underline} Especially on the north coast and in the North
Pole (Russian Arctic), the current geopolitical situation is leading the
EU to adopt measures in the field of strategic positioning, internal
priorities, or the dual use of infrastructure (Padrtova, B., 2020). For
example, the EU Satellite Centre (SatCen) ensures geospatial security by
monitoring the region; Galileo offers search and rescue security
services; and the Galileo Regulated Public Service seeks unlimited and
uninterrupted access to navigate in the Arctic waters of the EU to its
authorised users.

Moreover, [there would be three variables to consider for strong EU
security and defence in the Arctic]{.underline}. First, the dominions of
the [Kingdom of Denmark]{.underline} also [encompass Greenland and the
Faroe Islands]{.underline}, which is [a strategic area]{.underline} that
became a focal point [in terms of Arctic diplomacy]{.underline} (Kočí,
A.; Baar, V., 2021). [Secondly, Finland joined]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} on April 4, 2023, [marked a before and after in terms
of protecting water domains from Russian influence and affecting the
Arctic in terms of free trade, trade routes, and global maritime
transport. Third, Sweden joined]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} on
February 26, 2024[, was intended to close this area of
influence.]{.underline}

However, [not only military actions by sea, land or air are a threat in
terms of security and defence]{.underline}. Among others, [climate
change and melting ice become greater strategic
competition]{.underline}, the Barents Sea accumulates spent nuclear fuel
and radioactive waste, and current geopolitical tensions are leading
actors to seek benefits for energy resources. Finally, [Russia is not
the only threat to the EU's presence in the Arctic region]{.underline}.
The activities of [other actors (i.e. China) are making the area more
insecure]{.underline}, for instance, through growing interest in
infrastructure ownership, maritime cable construction, global shipping,
cyberspace, and disinformation.

### U -- EU autonomy increasing

#### EU autonomy is increasing -- economics and relations with other middle powers are developing capacity rapidly

Cain **Burdeau**, 3-28-20**25**, \"Experts: US-EU relations are at a new
low --- and forever damaged\", No Publication,

BAO

["You have]{.underline} an administration, not just [Trump]{.underline},
but many in the administration[, who not only do not see the value of a
European Union, but they are actively trying to undermine
Europe]{.underline}," said Scott Lucas, a professor of international
politics at University College Dublin.

An impending breakup

Of course, this isn\'t the first rough moment in transatlantic
relations. Indeed, the friendship has long been marked by discord and
mistrust.

There was former French President Charles de Gaulle, who kicked American
troops off French soil in 1966. Burning American flags was commonplace
during anti-war protests in the late 1960s. In the 1970s, Europeans
marched against the placement of U.S. nuclear warheads in their
countries.

[In the 1980s, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan blasted Europeans for
buying oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union.]{.underline} In 2003,
after France refused to back the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the cafeteria in
the U.S. Congress renamed French fries to "freedom fries."

[But these spats in the past did not present a "systemic challenge" to
the alliance like what\'s taking place now, Lucas said.]{.underline}

In part, [the Trump administration\'s antagonism toward the EU can be
explained by its dislike for multilateral organizations]{.underline},
Lucas said.

"This is a transactional administration," he said. "It is the idea that
they don\'t really think of win-win politics, they think win-lose
politics."

He said this approach is domineering in both domestic and foreign
affairs.

"The idea is that you don\'t need the courts, you don\'t need Congress,
you don\'t need the U.S. agencies, you just need loyalists," he said.
"They pursue an autocratic approach to foreign policy and that you
don\'t need allies. You don\'t need partnerships as such. [You simply
need transactions where you can reap a profit from it."]{.underline}

Today\'s Europe was born from the ashes of World War II and the EU was
built with consensus and multilateralism at its core with the idea that
this model would prevent another descent into war, Lucas said.

[But he said the Trump administration seems void of the "collective
memory" of the horrors of World War II and the necessity to uphold
multilateralism to prevent war.]{.underline}

"You\'re in an existential moment, not just for the EU and U.S. but for
the whole notion of international order," he said. "For the first time
since the late \'40s, you have got a major actor who doesn\'t believe in
those rules in that order and that\'s the U.S."

[He predicted the looming breakup between the U.S. and EU may happen
quickly.]{.underline}

"I don\'t think it\'s going to be slow and gradual necessarily," he
said. "[It could be much more quick than we realize."]{.underline}

[He said Europe has the economic might to go its own way and that new
alliances are forming as Canada, Europe, Australia and others see the
need of building bridges.]{.underline}

[Laffan said Europe will respond to the rupture with the U.S. by
building up its own militaries and forging new alliances, as seen with
efforts by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister
Keir Starmer to muster a "coalition of the willing" to send peacekeeping
troops to Ukraine.]{.underline}

"That program is already underway and will continue because the
Europeans are not going to say, \'Roll over us, we\'re not interested in
our future prosperity or our future security,\'" she said[. "They\'re
going to take agency."]{.underline}

Amid this turmoil, she said the EU sees Ukraine\'s fate as its most
pressing concern because it cannot allow Trump to force Kyiv into
capitulating to Russia.

"If there is a ceasefire or peace process, would this be a capitulation
of Ukraine? In which case, Europe then has a very unstable Russian
domination in the near-abroad, which is very dangerous," she said. "Or
can those countries like Ukraine and Moldova continue to aspire to a
European future, which is what their people want?"

#### A stronger commitment to defense spending is boosting EU strategic autonomy

Karn **Anutarasoti,** 20**25** - graduated from MSc International
Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. "The
EU\'s Geopolitical Awakening: How the War in Ukraine Redefined Europe?"
Foreign Analysis, Spring
<https://foreignanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FOREIGN-ANALYSIS-SPRING-2025-1.pdf>
//DH

As a result of the invasion of Ukraine, many EU countries and [the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion itself [drastically increased
defense spending]{.underline}, as the war on European soil was, in many
ways, a wake-up call for countries to take security matters into their
own hands. In 2022, [Germany,]{.underline} which had been criticized for
its low defense spending, [approved a fund of €100 billion
for]{.underline} the Bundeswehr, intended to provide a range of new
equipment, including [air defense, cyber defense, and various
weapons]{.underline}, ammunition, and drones. This is an important part
of the EU's shift in defense strategy, as [the less-committal stance
from the U.S. in aiding Ukraine showed European countries that matters
of European defense **require strategic autonomy**]{.underline} and
self-reliance, rather than dependence on an alliance with the U.S. In
addition, to make the EU's strategy on Ukraine less dependent on the
U.S., the European Peace Facility was formed to aid Ukraine, with €6.1
billion being transferred to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024 to address
the beleaguered nation's defense needs.

This is an important step for European strategic autonomy, as [it
enables the EU to reduce its risk exposure to potentially isolationist
currents in the U.S.]{.underline} With the return of Trump to the U.S.
presidency, [initiatives such as the European Peace Facility are now
critical to the EU's security]{.underline}, [as Trump's isolationist
views pose significant geopolitical risks to the EU]{.underline}, and
EU-level initiatives allow the EU to distance itself from a potentially
unfriendly administration in the U.S . As a result of Trump's more
isolationist policies, [the EU has a budget plan to drastically increase
defense spending by around €840 million]{.underline} to boost European
security. [Such actions strengthen European strategic
autonomy]{.underline}, as they allow the EU to gain security guarantees
from within its own borders.

#### The EU is pursuing strategic autonomy in response to Trump

Giovanni **Grevi,** 20**25** - senior associate fellow with the Centre
for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy of the Brussels School of
Governance "Securing Europe's Future: Partnership Through Strength" 4/8,

//DH

Within less than three months, the [Trump]{.underline} administration
has [seriously depleted strategic trust across the Atlantic. It has
sought]{.underline} engagement and [normalization with Russia while
sidelining Ukraine and Europe, threatened to seize
Greenland]{.underline}---a self-governing part of the Kingdom of
Denmark, [imposed massive tariffs]{.underline} on European goods, and
disparaged Europe's democratic norms.

Consequently, [Europeans can no longer rely on a partnership with
Washington]{.underline} based on hope or deference. Instead, they should
apply a flexible mix of strategic patience and firmness, pursuing
partnership through strength. That requires redefining the terms of
engagement with the United States. The principal vector for doing
so---albeit not the only one---is [the European Union, which gives
European countries critical mass]{.underline} and embodies their shared
choices and values.

[The EU]{.underline} and its member states [are now striving to lay out
an agenda that will make them both less reliant on the United States and
more resilient to external pressures]{.underline}---from Washington and
any other power. In short, more sovereign.

[Building European sovereignty is also the best way to revamp the
transatlantic partnership, if and when Washington relinquishes the
revisionist course]{.underline} that the U.S. administration is setting.

### AT: Political divisions / leadership

#### Fears of US abandonment are driving [political will]{.underline} for reform and stronger autonomy

Toward a European power center.

[Trump's hesitancy to continue arming Ukraine, aggressive tariffs on
European allies, and repeated threats to withdraw]{.underline} from or
abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have [forced the
continent to rethink its relationship with the United States---and to
coordinate more closely to compete with larger global
powers]{.underline}.

Notably, [the European Union itself has stepped up to play
champion]{.underline}. The European Commission, which runs the
confederation of European states, has decided to be more activist in
determining the continent's future. [A recent EU defense strategy
document illustrates Europe's strategic shift]{.underline}: "The
political equilibrium that emerged from the end of the Second World War
and then the conclusion of the Cold War has been severely disrupted. ...
A new international order will be formed in the second half of this
decade and beyond. Unless we shape this order---in both our region and
beyond---we will be passive recipients of the outcome of this period."
[The white paper outlines how the EU will invest more than \$150 billion
into European defense companies to disentangle its fragmented defense
industrial base, a clear sign that Europe is moving away from relying on
American arm]{.underline}s.

Amid growing uncertainty about the credibility of U.S. extended nuclear
deterrence, Polish officials have proposed hosting French nuclear
weapons---a move that [France has signaled it may support by broadening
its nuclear umbrella to cover more of Europe]{.underline}. Additionally,
**[fear of U.S. abandonment]{.underline}** [has also forced a United
Kingdom-EU rapprochement on trade and defense cooperation after a decade
of strained relationships from]{.underline} the [Brexit]{.underline}
fallout.

Europe's economic posture is evolving in parallel. In response to
Trump-era tariffs---and the threat of more to come---Brussels has
prepared counter-tariffs and accelerated efforts to diversify trade ties
away from the United States. New trade deals, such as the EU's trade
negotiations with India, are part of this effort. European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen underscored this realignment recently,
emphasizing Europe's focus on "engaging with countries that account for
87% of global trade and share our commitment to a free and open exchange
of goods, services, and ideas." The EU plans to negotiate an
unprecedented amount of trade deals.

For decades, Europe anchored its foreign and economic policy in
transatlantic partnership, following the U.S. lead on security and
trade. But the Trump administration's aggressive tariffs, wavering
support for Ukraine, and [open threats to undermine NATO have pushed
European leaders to fundamentally rethink that relationship.
Europe]{.underline} is not abandoning the United States. But it [is
building a future where it no longer depends on Washington]{.underline}.
In doing so, [it is steadily emerging as a standalone power
bloc---capable of advancing its interests independently of,
and]{.underline} at times [in defiance of, American
leadership]{.underline}.

[The positive of this narrow agenda was the ability to agree a new
defence spending target of 5% of GDP on defence]{.underline}: with 3.5%
allocated to hard capabilities, and a further 1.5% on security related
spending including infrastructure and cyber security, by 2035. Yet,
Rutte at a speech in London just 2 weeks ago warned that 'Russia could
be ready to use military force against NATO within five years'. Within
defence planning the most important time is 'H Hour' -- the point when
you expect to be in combat. NATO cannot wait to deliver and thus train
on new capabilities ahead of when they might be needed. As a national
task this is hard. As part of an Alliance, it makes interoperability
incredibly difficult. [Germany]{.underline} obviously did not get the
memo and has [pledged to meet the target in 2029 -- the date when its
intelligence service believes it may be at war with Russia -- making it
a **significant European leader for rearmament**]{.underline}.

[European Union leaders]{.underline} on Thursday [committed to working

billions of euros for security after]{.underline} U.S. President Donald
[Trump's]{.underline} repeated [warnings t]{.underline}hat [he would cut
them adrift]{.underline} to face the threat of Russia alone.

[With the growing conviction that they will now have to fend for
themselves, countries that have faltered on defense spending for decades
held emergency talks]{.underline} in Brussels to explore new ways to
beef up their security and ensure future protection for Ukraine.

"Today history is being written," European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen told reporters after the summit ended.

She said [the 27 EU leaders are "determined to ensure Europe's security
and to act with the scale, the speed and the resolve]{.underline} that
[this situation demands]{.underline}. We are determined to invest more,
to invest better and to invest faster together."

[The pledge underscored a **sea change in geopolitics** spurred on by
Trump]{.underline}, who has undermined 80 years of cooperation based on
the understanding that the U.S. would help protect European nations
following World War II.

### AT: Populism

#### European politics is shifting in favor of greater autonomy -- far right populists are less likely to gain a foothold

Ivan **Krastev,** 20**25** - is a permanent fellow at the Institute of
Human Sciences and a board member of the European Council on Foreign
Relations "Trump's revolution comes to Europe" Politico, 6/24,
<https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-revolution-europe-sovereignty-eu-us-populist-far-right-cdu-russia-ukraine-military/>
//DH

[After talking to 16,000 individuals in 12 European
countries]{.underline}, our organization, the European Council on
Foreign Relations ([ECFR), found that Trump's victory has changed the
nature of Europe's domestic politics]{.underline} as well as its
geopolitical standing.

Almost overnight, [the bloc's far right has gone from passionate
defenders of national sovereignty against the]{.underline} threat of a
federalist [EU to the vanguard of a transnational movement that
advocates]{.underline} a sort of [civilizational
nationalism]{.underline}. Conversely, many mainstream parties --- or,
rather, the ex-globalists --- have recast themselves as the new
sovereigntists, defending national dignity against what they perceive to
be ideological interference from Washington.

Supporters of Europe's populist parties are no longer protest voters
either. According to our data, a majority of those supporting every one
of the 10 far-right parties we polled on, think Trump's reelection will
be good for the U.S., and view his actions with sympathy and excitement.
Much like the bloc's far-right leaders, who are copying his policies on
everything from immigration to blowing up national bureaucracies.

The result of all this seems to be the emergence of an ideological
transatlantic relationship, no longer dividing the continent into pro-
and anti-U.S. countries but rather pro- and anti-Trump political
parties. Unlike the split triggered by the war in Iraq in 2003, for
instance, Eastern Europe isn't more U.S. friendly than Western Europe
because of a strong pro-American societal consensus but because its
far-right parties are stronger.

However, it remains unclear whether [Europe's far right]{.underline}
will be the major beneficiary or the victim of Trump's revolution.

On the one hand --- as was the case with Brexit --- his reelection shows
[it's still possible]{.underline} for them [to come to
power]{.underline}. [But if people turn against Trump and his politics,
these parties will be the biggest losers.]{.underline} Their support
depends on the U.S. leader in the same way support for Western European
Communist parties depended on how people viewed the Soviet Union and its
policies during the Cold War.

On the other end of the spectrum, we're now seeing several of Europe's
most traditionally Atlanticist parties, such as Germany's Christian
Democratic Union, reinventing themselves as defenders of national
sovereignty against Trump's America. It's a shift that aligns with our
polling, which clearly shows the countries that appear to be most
skeptical of America today seem to be the ones that were the most
Atlanticist yesterday, like the U.K., Germany and Denmark.

Denmark in particular --- with 86 percent of those polled saying they
believe the U.S. political system to be broken --- best illustrates that
people radically turn against the U.S. not when Trump is attacking
Europe but when he threatens their nation's sovereignty.

Meanwhile, [the ongoing transformation of Europe's geopolitical identity
is just as dramatic, with Trump's reelection forcing Europe to finally
take its security seriously]{.underline}. More specifically, while the
fear of Russian aggression remains mostly confined to countries directly
bordering it, according to our polling, there is now a clear
pan-European fear of nuclear conflict and a new world war.

Looking at the results, we can see that [majorities now favor increased
defense spending, continued support for Ukraine]{.underline} if the U.S.
withdraws support [and, in many countries, even the introduction of
mandatory military servic]{.underline}e. In many countries --- except
for Italy and Hungary --- majorities upward of 60 percent even favor the
development of a European nuclear deterrent, while some also ask for
national nuclear deterrence.

#### Support for a stronger EU is higher than nationalist support

//DH

But failure is not inevitable. [Public opinion]{.underline} across
Europe [is]{.underline} complicated --- and [more pro-European --- than
it might seem. Voters may be frustrated with the EU, but they are not
opposed to a unified Europe.]{.underline} To the contrary. [According to
the latest Eurobarometer poll, 81 percent of Europeans support "a common
defense and security policy among EU member states" while 74 percent
approve of the euro]{.underline}. [On average, Europeans]{.underline}
also **[trust the EU more]{.underline}** [than their national
governments]{.underline}. These are all signs that a federalist project
might resonate with many, maybe even the majority of, Europeans.

#### EU independence allows it to assert a global leadership role and stave off domestic populism

Sophia **Besch &** Tara **Varma,** 20**25** -- \*senior fellow in the
Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace AND
\*\*visiting fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe (CUSE)
at the Brookings Institution "Alliance of Revisionists: A New Era for
the Transatlantic Relationship" Survival, Issue 2, Taylor & Francis //DH

[Transatlantic revisionists are united]{.underline} not just by their
ideology, but also [by a shared dislike and distrust of multilateralism
and the EU. While they are not in power everywhere, their influence over
centre-left and centre-right parties and administrations across Europe
is substantial.]{.underline} And even though Trump has not yet been in
office very long, transatlantic outreach across revisionist camps has
been extensive.

The [pressure from MAGA and European revisionists may be mounting, but
the EU is not without recourse. Given]{.underline} that the world is a
much different place than it was when the transatlantic relationship was
conceived, and that [the US appears to be withdrawing from global
leadership, the **Union could seize its own leadership role** in
combatting climate change and advocating for multilateralism and a
rules-based international order]{.underline}. It has already armed
itself with mechanisms to wield its economic clout strategically, and
has begun scrutinising X for fostering hate speech, disinformation and
other harmful content.120 Europeans can and should work together to
strengthen NATO and make it more resilient against American indifference
and pro-Russian actors in Europe. European integration was able to
thrive only under the US security umbrella. [The EU will not survive
without a collective European defence and a sense of European solidarity
against security threats.]{.underline}

The EU's regulatory framework matters. Revisionists denounce the
intricate and cumbersome nature of the EU system, and would like to do
away with it. But this system was devised to prevent individuals from
making tyrannical or arbitrary decisions. If countries that had been at
war in living memory could make their way through legal and political
debates, there was hope that traditional power dynamics could be
overcome. While the EU may wish to become more active in geopolitics and
to use the full range of industrial and financial tools at its disposal,
rolling back its regulatory advances could amount to the end of that
system.Footnote121 Transatlantic revisionists would like to fragment the
EU as a means of undermining its regulatory power.Footnote122 The
American agenda aims at turning Europe into a vassalised market in which
tech and climate regulations lose their effectiveness under the threat
of commercial coercion. European revisionists, with their focus on
national sovereignty, could be the key to achieving this goal.

The European project cannot succeed if it pre-emptively bows to
pressure, including from within its own ranks. Revisionists on both
sides of the Atlantic have made clear that their goal is to divide and
conquer. If the Union is to survive, Europeans must invest in their own
security and resilience, stand up to the bully across the Atlantic and
not permit MAGA's allies in Brussels to do Trump's bidding.

### AT: Energy dependence

#### The EU is moving towards energy independence now

Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. "The
EU\'s Geopolitical Awakening: How the War in Ukraine Redefined Europe?"

//DH

Unlike the 2014 Ukraine crisis, when European countries continued to
import Russian gas, [the war in Ukraine saw a great reduction in
reliance on Russian gas]{.underline}. After sanctions were imposed,
imports of pipeline gas from Russia diminished drastically, while
volumes of LNG imports from reliable partners like the U.S. (until
Trump) or Norway have been increasing. The importance of such policy
shifts is that by reducing reliance on Russian gas, the EU gains more
leeway for assertive and confrontational policies to defend Ukraine's
sovereignty. [This also reduces the leverage that Russia has over the
EU]{.underline}, as Moscow has historically used gas as a bargaining
chip in geopolitics. [The Net Zero Industry Act was also
passed]{.underline} in response to the Inflation Reduction Act being
passed in the U.S., [aiming to build a European-based supply chain and
reduce reliance on imports, thereby weakening the leverage that other
countries have over the EU]{.underline}. [The Net Zero Industry Act
mandates that the EU must produce at least 40% of its annual deployment
needs for key clean technologies like solar panels, wind turbines,
batteries, heat pumps, and hydrogen electrolyzers]{.underline} by 2030.

[This will reduce the need to import materials from countries like the
U.S. and China]{.underline}, which helps the EU's strategic autonomy
ambitions, as it makes the Union less beholden to foreign powers,
removing their political leverage over the European Union. [This will
help the EU pursue more autonomous foreign policies independent of the
U.S., as self-reliance means there is less need to concede to other
countries on foreign policy]{.underline}, making them less able and
therefore less likely to put the EU's supply chain at risk. [Having a
domestic energy supply chain also prevents other countries from
manipulating the EU's politics by using energy as leverage]{.underline}.
The Net Zero Industry Act also assists in reducing oil imports. This
allows the EU to pursue a more assertive policy, as oil-producing states
are often authoritarian states like Saudi Arabia, whose geopolitical and
ideological positions do not align with the EU and which has cut oil
production to increase prices as a tool of leverage. Therefore, the Net
Zero Industry Act will remove the ability of countries like Saudi Arabia
to exercise political influence within the EU and will provide energy
security that is independent of authoritarian states.

### AT: Economic capacity

JP)

But [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [withdrawal and
economic self-sabotage also creates a unique opportunity for
Europe]{.underline} at home and abroad. [The
admin]{.underline}istration'[s]{.underline} chaotic [tariff policy,
b]{.underline}udget-[b]{.underline}usting tax [b]{.underline}ill[, and
attacks on the Federal Reserve have spooked investors and
companies,]{.underline} many o[f who]{.underline}m [are turning away
from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and looking for safe
harbors in Europe and elsewhere.]{.underline} [In March]{.underline},
[a]{.underline} monthly [Bank of America]{.underline} survey of 198
global [investors representing nearly \$530 billion in
assets]{.underline} under management [showed]{.underline} the
[large]{.underline}st [reallocation out of U.S. equities and into
European equities in the survey's history]{.underline}.

As Washington turns inward, the West is desperately searching for new
leadership to uphold security and economic norms. If it plays its cards
right, [Europe could take on the role that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has abjured]{.underline}. Fortunately, the reforms
that Europe needs to make are clear. [European leaders should ramp up
public investment---and coordination---on defense and strategic
sectors]{.underline} such as critical technology[. They must pass
economic reforms to ensure the bloc's long-term competitiveness.
And]{.underline} they need to [streamline decision-making on sanctions
and critical aspects of trade policy.]{.underline}

In some ways, [the **continent is already moving in this
direction**]{.underline}. In March, Germany passed a 500 billion euro
(\$542 billion) stimulus and loosened government borrowing limits to pay
for defense and infrastructure. Likewise, the European Commission's
ReArm Europe Plan, an initiative to accelerate the bloc's defense
capabilities and coordination, allocated 150 billion euros (\$170
billion) in defense loans to member states.

[But European leaders need to do much more, and there is]{.underline}
still [a lack of urgency]{.underline} in some quarters. [The EU needs to
realize the power it has as the second]{.underline}-[largest
global]{.underline} [economy]{.underline}, in terms of GDP, [and work
closely with partners outside the union, such as Ukraine, the
U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom[, and Turkey. If it
does]{.underline} so[, it will emerge as a more economically formidable,
politically united, and geopolitically consequential player,
and]{.underline} a [leader in this turbulent new geopolitical
era]{.underline}.

### AT: US-EU split inevitable

#### Autonomy's not inevitable. Latent support for US relations means it can be reversed

Institute and Full Professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid,

//DH

The [growing support for greater European strategic autonomy should be
interpreted with caution. The European stance largely reflects a desire
to push forward EU strategic initiatives **without undermining the
alliance with the US**]{.underline}. [This is the case with Ireland
which maintains a cautious strategic stance]{.underline} due to close
economic and security relationships with the US. Additionally, some
countries have maintained their scepticism or even reversed course. [In
Italy]{.underline}, both [the]{.underline} Draghi and [Meloni
governments have maintained strong ties with Washington and are wary of
straining transatlantic relations by endorsing a strategic autonomy
agenda.]{.underline} In Hungary, Orbán has said that theoretically he
supports Europe's strategic autonomy, but only if that means the
autonomy of the Member States and not of a federal EU.

#### EU autonomy requires [political will]{.underline} and that's only sustained by [opposition]{.underline} to the US -- the plan reverses the Trump effect

Rosa **Balfour**, 20**25** - director of Carnegie Europe "Europe Tried
to Trump-Proof Itself. Now It's Crafting a Plan B." 4/30,

//DH

Second, the need for European states to increase their defense spending
was long overdue, and the open discussion about assuming responsibility
for territorial defense and deterrence is unprecedented. [Governments
are taking drastic measures to increase defense spending, with Germany's
U-turn on public debt as the most remarkable evidence that taboos can be
broken]{.underline}. [Alongside national decisions on how to raise
defense spending to more than 3 percent of GDP]{.underline}---whether
through taxation, cuts, or debt---[several initiatives have been
announced and others are being discussed to address how the EU can
contribute to these efforts]{.underline}.

Aside from financing Europe's security, the complexities of coordination
between NATO, its members, and the EU is a major hurdle. But the real
challenge is to overcome existing fragmentation in the defense industry
and in procurement. Spending alone does not make Europe more capable of
defending itself.

Politically, to ensure public support for rearming Europe and to offset
the inevitable costs, defense efforts ought to be part of a broader
strategy of economic and technological innovation. Indeed, these efforts
could boost Europe's stagnant economy. At the EU level, the recipes are
available in recent recommendations addressing competitiveness,
productivity, and technological innovation.

Indeed, [Trump's first 100 days are pushing the EU to put some momentum
behind projects that have been underway for years]{.underline}. Tying
these objectives with the enlargement of the EU to include Ukraine,
Moldova, and the Western Balkans adds a new perspective to upscaling the
single market. Expanding the EU and deepening the relationship with
other European countries---like the UK, Switzerland, and Norway---would
counter the fragmentation that great power competition and political
disruption at home are inflicting on the continent.

The final building block of this response is a newfound penchant for
global engagement as a means to diversify the EU's economy and political
relations. The tariff barrage unleashed by the United States has
prompted a flurry of promises to pursue free trade deals with a range of
partners across the globe. In February, after two decades of stagnating
talks, the EU and India (re)discovered each other and agreed to finalize
a free trade agreement by the end of 2025. At the end of 2024, the EU
and Mercosur finalized a trade agreement. New opportunities are being
discussed with the UAE, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others. The EU
could act as a node in a global trade and cooperation network
alternative to the United States's unilateral protectionism.

Needless to say, [the political will and resources to achieve these
goals are hard to sustain. The economic and social costs of the security
and economic transition at home will lead to political challenges in a
volatile context in which few governments enjoy wide popular support,
though the EU is enjoying positive public opinion polling at the
moment---likely a **silver lining of the Trump effect**]{.underline}.

The EU's security turn will come at the expense of its soft power, with
reputational costs at home and abroad. Making its economy fit for
geopolitical disruption entails daunting obstacles and difficult
choices. Europe's vulnerability to great power rivalry is compounded by
disruptive political forces that embrace Trumpian world views.
Transatlantic nostalgia could slow down the collective effort, should
Washington revisit its current European stance. The armory of policy
could fail. And the outcomes may not be to everyone's liking.

Yet [a trajectory of change has been charted, and it has transformative
potential---not just for the European continent, but also for the global
reordering of post-American international relations]{.underline}. The
jazz band has picked up rhythm, even if the melody is not fully
harmonic.

This paper has sought to answer the question: in light of growing global
geopolitical tensions, what role does the EU seek to take in the Arctic?
Explaining the rise of the EU as a geopolitical commission under Von der
Leyen helps to understand a geopolitical reading of the EUAP. The EUAP
was published in 2021 under more stable military-geopolitical conditions
when climate change posed the biggest threat to global environmental
security. [With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the security dynamics
have, however, changed.]{.underline} [Military, energy and economic
security are now among the top priorities of EU foreign and security
policy. The EU is a comprehensive security provider on a European,
international and global scale, allowing it to contribute to all types
of security questions we currently face.]{.underline}

[Overall, the action plan of the EUAP, together with the new adjustments
in the Strategic Compass, seems to be a fit plan for the EU to increase
its status as an international security provider, be it in
environmental, economic or military terms.]{.underline} It is, however,
hard to tell how this will evolve, as uncertainties mark the
geopolitical situation of Europe and the Arctic. For now, the EU seeks
to become a constructive and responsible actor in the Arctic region as
it considers the region of strategic importance. [It does this by
protecting the Arctic environment, promoting its economic interests,
strengthening Arctic governance, increasing cooperation with regional
stakeholders, and focusing on a strong engagement with Arctic
communities.]{.underline}

Today, the High Representative and the Commission put forward their
approach for a stronger EU engagement for a peaceful, sustainable and
prosperous Arctic.

The [**Arctic region is of key strategic importance for the European
Union**, in view of climate change, raw materials as well as
geostrategic influence.]{.underline}
The [Communication](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/105481/joint-communication-stronger-eu-engagement-peaceful-sustainable-and-prosperous-arctic_en) responds
to these [geopolitical, environmental, economic, security and social
challenges and opportunities]{.underline}. It [seeks to foster
cooperation with partners on sustainable approaches]{.underline} to
overcome them.

The EU will establish a European Commission office in Greenland, which
will raise the profile of Arctic matters in the EU\'s external
relations. [EU funding will also be directed towards driving the green
transition in the Arctic, for the benefit of Arctic
populations.]{.underline}

Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) and in support of
global climate action, the Communication calls for oil, coal and gas to
remain in the ground.

Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission,
said: *"[The Arctic is changing rapidly, owing to the impact of global
warming, increased competition for natural resources and geopolitical
rivalries. These developments show that Europe must define its
geopolitical interests broadly to promote stability, safety and peaceful
cooperation in the Arctic."]{.underline}*

Virginijus Sinkevičius, Commissioner for the Environment, Fisheries and
Maritime Affairs said: *"The Arctic region is warming three times faster
than the rest of the planet. The melting of ice and thawing of
permafrost in the Arctic further accelerate climate change and have huge
knock-on effects. [The EU is committed to make the Arctic safe, stable,
sustainable and prosperous. Safe and stable, through enhanced
international cooperation; sustainable and prosperous, by ensuring a
strong link between the EU\'s Arctic engagement and our climate policy,
the European Green Deal and its blue economy dimension".]{.underline}*

The Role of the U.S. in Arctic Security

for [sustained investment in Arctic-specific]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Way Forward

The inaugural ASDC set a strong foundation for future dialogue and
collaboration on Arctic security. As the region evolves, the need for
proactive, multilateral strategies will only grow more urgent. Moving
forward, [[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies [[must focus on
closing capability gaps, enhancing infrastructure resilience, and
addressing hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. Integrating Indigenous
knowledge and fostering multilateral cooperation will be essential for
navigating the Arctic's uncharted waters. The Arctic's future is still
being written, but one thing is clear: the decisions made in this
decisive decade will shape the region's trajectory for years to come.
The ASDC represents a critical step in ensuring that the Arctic remains
secure, stable, and strategically advantageous for the U.S. and its
allies.

Multipolar ordering.

The [regional blocs reflect a growing recognition that Washington can no
longer be counted on as a stable guarantor of the liberal international
order.]{.underline} [Yet these shifts are still in their early
stages---and **they are reversible**]{.underline}. The United States
remains an indispensable power: No other nation possesses the same
combination of military reach, economic scale, and alliance networks.
[U.S. allies are not seeking to replace Washington, but to protect
themselves from its volatility. If America **recommits to consistent
leadership**]{.underline}---backed by credible security guarantees,
renewed economic engagement, and reciprocal partnership---[it can remain
at the center of the emerging order. But if it continues]{.underline}

JMP))

Towards a more credible EU Arctic strategy

So far, this CSDS Policy Brief has outlined the security challenges
facing the EU in the Arctic. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has altered
the EU's geopolitical stance, but there is a long way to go before the
EU can be called more than a diplomatic actor. So far, the [EU has not
yet established a specific and coordinated security policy for the
Arctic region]{.underline}. The [**lack of autonomous military capacity
has limited the EU's ability to influence the balance of power** in the
region.]{.underline} [EU interests range from **energy security** and
the **protection of trade routes** to **environmental sustainability**
and **cooperation with local communities**.]{.underline} The presence of
vast oil and gas reserves and the opening of new sea routes make the
Arctic crucial for diversifying European energy supplies, as well as
reducing transport times between Europe and Asia. For the Russian
economy, which is mainly based on trade in raw materials and
hydrocarbons, the supply of Arctic resources is undoubtedly a key
element, especially at this time of internal economic instability.
However, [the EU rightly watches the evolving regional dynamics with
concern, as this could mean possible future energy instability for
the]{.underline} nations of the [Union]{.underline}, especially if
bilateral relations with the Kremlin remain frosty.

[Russian militarisation]{.underline} and the expansion of military
capabilities along the Arctic coast [require a calibrated response from
the EU]{.underline}. Until now, [the EU's focus on diplomacy and
environmental cooperation]{.underline}, while important, [has not
adequately addressed the growing strategic competition]{.underline}.
Should the conflict in Ukraine end in the near future, [Sweden and
Finland can act as facilitators to integrate an Arctic security
dimension into the EU's approach]{.underline}, while [promoting a
multilateral dialogue to **prevent escalation**]{.underline}. The
presence of both Sweden and Finland in NATO could result in an increase
in the EU's military presence and legitimacy in the region. [The EU's
ability to influence regional stability depends on its success to act as
a mediator between the major powers]{.underline}. This posture, given
the breakdown in regional cooperation with Russia, it seems not yet
willing to take. Ideally, the [EU could position itself as an
**independent actor in the Arctic**, capable of promoting international
standards for the sustainable management of maritime resources and
shipping routes]{.underline}. However, it is impossible not to overlap
NATO's interests with those of the EU given the large number of common
members. Thus, excluding this hypothesis, one could reflect on the role
[the EU could]{.underline} play in [defus]{.underline}ing [tensions
between China and the US in the Arctic]{.underline}, along with
like-minded partners. We argue that the [EU is well-placed to try
this]{.underline}, although the approach is not without considerable
risks. Such cooperation is unlikely to prevent an alignment between
China and Russia on Arctic affairs, but the [EU's and China's common
interests in secure maritime trade routes could lower
tensions]{.underline}.

Despite the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), [the EU is not a
military alliance, but an expression of the cooperation of European
nations. This cooperation]{.underline}, however, [is limited regarding
security]{.underline}. In contrast, [security is theoretically
guaranteed by NATO]{.underline}, an expression of Western cooperation.
[However, the US clearly holds a dominant position within the
Alliance]{.underline}. This means that although the strategic interests
between the EU and NATO in the Arctic may be similar, they are not
entirely the same. Nowadays, for example, while war threatens the EU's
borders, [Trump's election]{.underline} in the US [highlights an
anti-interventionist stance, potentially weakening NATO's
relevance]{.underline}. In this respect, the [EU member states should
strive to **lower their dependency on the US in defence terms**. Arctic
security exemplifies the EU's security limitations, risking insufficient
competitiveness if NATO deems it non-essential given also the shift of
US strategic priorities towards the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. [Without
a more assertive posture by the EU in the Arctic, regional security will
depend on third-party management, **limiting the Union's independence
and bargaining power in political strategies**]{.underline}. [Weak
bargaining ties Europe to the US' willingness to employ deterrence,
which could]{.underline}, however, [turn out to be devalued]{.underline}
if other states know the US' posture. [A more **independent EU defence**
would better protect EU interests, **securing fair Arctic resource
access** and **enhancing mediation** through **independent deterrence
capabilities**. It would also help the EU **develop its own strategic
culture**, foster military-technological innovation and boost its
autonomy.]{.underline}

[The Arctic shows]{.underline}, much like the war in Ukraine, that
[there is a need for the **EU to**]{.underline} be able to **[formulate
and pursue its own goals without being overly dependent on
Washington]{.underline}**. To be clear, [the US will remain the EU's
main ally but it should not be overly dependent on Washington,
especially given]{.underline} recent signals by the [Trump]{.underline}
administration on Greenland and the broader Arctic region. A [military
role for the EU in the Arctic]{.underline} or elsewhere [means not only
potential active involvement in kinetic action, but also the ability to
monitor and protect critical infrastructures and **ensure credible
deterrence** against possible aggression or external
interference]{.underline}, and only then, possibly, [direct intervention
if necessary]{.underline}. In fact, exerting deterrence and pursuing
de-escalation in the Arctic could represent a shared goal for the EU and
NATO, should the US administration desire this. Either way, [European
nations must develop **independent technological capabilities** to
secure the EU's strategic interests in the Arctic region]{.underline}.
To this end, the [EU should prioritise region-specific surveillance and
defence technologies including underwater acoustic monitoring systems
and unmanned platforms]{.underline} (USV, UUV, UAV). [Such efforts would
allow the Europeans to track Russian movements]{.underline}, especially
near the Kola Peninsula, while safeguarding EU-funded and co-funded
connectivity projects in the Arctic like the North Pole Fiber and
Northern EU Gateways among others. Additionally, [investment in
Arctic-appropriate naval defence systems, such as patrol vessels and
icebreakers, would **secure trade routes**, **subsea cables** and
**enhance the EU's role as a stabilising force**]{.underline}.

#### [The perm relegates the EU to a [junior partner]{.underline} -- only a clean break from the US can get [other middle powers]{.underline} on board with EU autonomy -- that's key to multilateralism]{.mark}

[Niklas **Helwig**, 20**23** -- The Finnish Institute of International
Affairs, Helsinki "EU Strategic Autonomy after the Russian Invasion of
Ukraine: Europe\'s Capacity to Act in Times of War" Journal of Common
Market Studies, <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.13527>
//DH]{.mark}

[The mixed reactions to the war of governments in the Global South once
more underlined the need for the EU to enhance its political and
co-ordinative diplomatic capacities. [Efforts by the EU to salvage the
multilateral system are not new]{.underline}. Since the 2016 election of
Donald Trump, the EU together with its member states had been focused on
ensuring the functioning of the rules-based co-operation in a more
contested environment (Schuette and Dijkstra, 2023). The High
Representative and the European Commission (2021) outlined in a joint
communication how the EU should 'leverage the EU\'s collective strength'
by better co-ordinating the EU\'s and member states\' activities. After
the Russian invasion, the EU\'s concerted diplomatic efforts somewhat
benefitted from the fact that there was already a momentum towards
joined diplomatic engagement.]{.mark}

[[However, questions remain on the long-term approach towards countries
in the Global South. They seem to hedge their bets in the global
competition]{.underline}, unwilling to prematurely sign up to either a
US-led or Chinese-led vision of the global order. [Whilst the EU has
shown some successes to 'win the vote' of middle powers]{.underline} on
a case-by-case basis, [the 'fence-sitters']{.underline} (Spektor, 2023)
[see their neutral position as a virtue to navigate the uncertainties of
a shifting world order]{.underline}. [From their
perspective]{.underline}, [a strategically autonomous EU]{.underline}
]{.mark}[that]{.underline} [[**does not 'ride the coattails of the US'**
but speaks with its own voice might be an attractive
proposition.]{.underline} 2 However, a strong EU voice entails that
Europe has more to offer for the Global South than its usual talking
points on the need to condemn Russia or on other issues, such as
migration. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the EU can
make an attractive offer to global partners independent from the United
States and China, as the EU was instrumental in setting up a global
alliance on vaccines and increased its support for the World Health
Organization (WHO) (Jokela et al., 2023).]{.mark}

[The Russian invasion revealed the potential strength of the EU\'s
diplomatic capacities in multilateral fora. In organisations such as the
UN and the WHO, the EU can leverage its sizeable co-ordinative
capacities. The EU\'s recent successes in the UN General Assembly pay
testament to that. However, in order to count as a strategically
autonomous actor in the current context of growing strategic
competition, the EU is in need of more political capacity to become not
only a 'majority whip' of the Global South but also its partner.]{.mark}

[Conclusions]{.mark}

[No one can deny the structural constrains of the international system
that position the EU and its member states strongly in the 'West' and
under a firm lead of the United States. The Russian war of aggression
underlined that the EU and its member states need global partners and
allies. Strategic autonomy from the rest of the world is even less of an
option than before. Instead, the question for the EU is whether it can
display agency within the system of its US security alliance and global
economic dependencies and thereby exercise strategic autonomy to
accomplish its aims. In other words, does the EU merely have capacity to
implement decisions set by others, or does it have capacity to act based
on its own preferences and politics and thereby the power to influence
global politics on its own terms?]{.mark}

[The EU shows signs of increased agency on some matters in the context
of the Russian war of aggression. The historic decisions in the first
months of the war to decouple energy relations with Russia, to provide
membership prospects to Ukraine and to invest more in European defence
had to be done under the pressure of the crisis. However, they were not
dictated by the United States or pre-agreed on in NATO and instead
showed the political capacity of the EU to act and the 'transformative
force' (Wessels, 2021) of the European Council. In the response to the
war thereafter, the EU showed that it is more than just a simple
regional implementation body of policies set by the United States or the
G7. The initially close economic ties between EU members with Russia and
the sectorial competences of the European Commission put the EU in a
favourable position to actively shape the complex economic response. The
EU also influenced the global diplomatic response to Russia\'s war,
because it benefitted from the diverse member-state diplomatic ties and
from the fact that it is not the United States, which has its own
controversial history of military engagement.]{.mark}

[A similar influence over global policies can be identified in the
debate on how to handle security challenges relating to China. The EU\'s
economic security strategy from June (European Commission, 2023b)
embodies its approach to strategic autonomy, which is not focused on
decoupling from global economic flows, and instead seeks a better
management of related risks. Whether this more nuanced de-risking
approach to containing China will prevail over the more hard-nosed
decoupling strategy, which is favoured by many in Washington DC, will
also depend on China\'s policy choices regarding support for the Russian
regime and conceivable military actions against Taiwan.]{.mark}

[Even a nuanced reading of strategic autonomy cannot conceal the
shortcomings that the EU is facing in its defence policy. The military
support that the EU and its member states are providing to Ukraine is
substantial. However, the war underlined the scepticism in Central and
Eastern Europe against ideas of strategic autonomy that go beyond EU
efforts in support of member-state and alliance policies. [Whilst EU
member states are increasing their joint co-ordinative and political
capacity, they also link their security more closely to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, as the decisions of Sweden and
Finland to join NATO exemplify. [Growing EU agency on]{.underline}
traditional [security]{.underline} and defence matters [remains an
unfulfilled ambition. Short of a transformational crisis in the
transatlantic alliance, the EU\'s role on security]{.underline} and
defence [is set to become that of a **muscled-up junior partner** to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and NATO.]{.mark}

Without U.S. Leadership---Are We Ready for That?" The Long Memo, 4/7/25
https://www.thelongmemo.com/p/europe-is-preparing-for-a-world-without//LL]{.mark}

[[Europe has relied on the United States for]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly
[[eight decades as the cornerstone of its security architecture. NATO,
formed in the wake of World War II, was built on the premise that
American power would serve as a stabilizing force against external
threats---first the Soviet Union, then global terrorism, and now, a
revanchist Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[That position is now being reassessed (at best) and most likely
outright abandoned.]{.mark}

[President [Trump's]{.underline} rhetoric and [actions have forced
European leaders to view the United States not just as an **unreliable
partner**, but increasingly as a potential threat to European
security]{.underline}. [This shift is not based on ideological
differences]{.underline} ]{.mark}or diplomatic disputes; [[it is
grounded in the core tenets of realism and balance-of-threat theory.
When a hegemonic power]{.underline}]{.mark} becomes unpredictable---when
its [[commitments waver,]{.underline}]{.mark} and its leaders openly
undermine alliances[[---other states must recalibrate their security
posture accordingly. That is exactly what Europe is now
doing.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The Erosion of Trust in NATO Commitments]{.mark}

[Trump's skepticism toward NATO is well-documented. He has openly
questioned the alliance's value, suggested that the U.S. might not
fulfill its Article 5 defense commitments, and framed America's security
guarantees as transactional rather than strategic. This approach
directly contradicts the logic of alliances outlined by theorists like
Walt, who argued that states form security coalitions not out of
goodwill, but because they face common threats. If an alliance no longer
guarantees protection, its members will seek alternatives.]{.mark}

[For European nations, Trump's rhetoric raises an alarming question: Can
they still rely on the United States as a security guarantor? If the
answer is no, then the logical course of action is to prepare for a
future in which the U.S. is absent---or even adversarial---in European
security calculations.]{.mark}

[Unilateral U.S. Actions and the Shift in Global Power
Perceptions]{.mark}

[Beyond NATO, Trump's broader approach to foreign policy has reinforced
European concerns. His unilateral decisions---such as withdrawing from
international agreements, imposing tariffs on European allies, and
abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine---have been perceived as
aligning more closely with authoritarian adversaries like Russia and
China than with traditional democratic allies.]{.mark}

[From a neorealist perspective, these actions accelerate what Kenneth
Waltz predicted: the inevitable balancing against U.S. power[. If the
U.S. is no longer willing to play the role of stabilizer, then **Europe
must step into that void**.]{.underline} [And if the U.S. begins
behaving in a way that actively destabilizes its allies, then Europe
must prepare to counterbalance American influence]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[Strategic Autonomy: Europe's Move Toward Self-Reliance]{.mark}

[In response to this shifting landscape, [European nations have taken
steps toward greater strategic autonomy]{.underline}:]{.mark}

[Increased Defense Spending: [Germany, France, and other EU nations have
proposed significant defense budgets to reduce reliance on U.S. military
support]{.underline}. NATO's European members are meeting or exceeding
the 2% GDP defense spending target---not because of Trump's demands, but
because they increasingly see no other choice.]{.mark}

[Independent Military Capabilities: The European Union has launched new
defense initiatives, such as the €800 billion ReArm Europe initiative,
designed to enhance military capacity independent of the United
States.]{.mark}

[New Strategic Alliances: [European leaders are exploring closer
security ties with each other and with emerging global powers, signaling
a shift away from automatic alignment]{.underline} with
Washington.]{.mark}

[The United States as a Potential Threat]{.mark}

[This reassessment of America's role is not merely about reliability; it
is about risk. Under balance-of-threat theory, states align against
actors they perceive as dangerous. Traditionally, Europe viewed Russia
as the primary threat---hence NATO's post-Cold War expansion. But [if
the United States becomes an unreliable, erratic, or destabilizing
force, then it too becomes something European nations must hedge
against.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[For decades, U.S. foreign policy was guided by a kind of implicit
bargain: America provided stability, and in return, allies followed its
lead. But realism tells us that alliances are not permanent; they exist
only as long as they serve mutual interests. [If Trump]{.underline}---or
any future U.S. president---[continues to weaken these foundations,
Europe will adapt. And adaptation means shifting from dependence on the
U.S. to a world where Europe is prepared to **act
independently**]{.underline}---even if that means counterbalancing
American influence.]{.mark}

### AT: Perm do both - Greenland

#### Standing up to US threats over Greenland is the fundamental driver of EU independence -- the EU needs to escalate against US pressure

Sophia **Besch and** Jeremy **Shapiro**, 20**25** -- senior fellow in
the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace AND
director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations "The
New American Imperialism: How Europe Can Deal With Trump's Threat to
Greenland" Lawfare, 3/2,
<https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-new-american-imperialism--how-europe-can-deal-with-trump-s-threat-to-greenland>
//DH

In just his first few weeks back in office, Trump's various
imperialistic threats toward Greenland---as well as toward Canada,
Panama, and Gaza---and the administration's shock-and-awe attack on the
U.S. federal government have already demonstrated the differences. [The
guardrails are gone, and the adults have left the room. The world will
see a much purer version of Trump]{.underline} in the next four years,
less filtered by traditional advisers and the institutions of U.S.
governance.

Accordingly, [we should expect the script for dealing with Trump in his
first term will no longer work]{.underline}. In 2019, when Trump's
Greenland obsession first emerged, [the Danish]{.underline} government
used a by then well-established strategy to deal with it: appease,
delay, and distract. First, they [sought to give Trump what they think
he wants]{.underline}---security enhancements in the Arctic, mining
concessions in Greenland, maybe a parade. The point of appeasement is to
cool the flames of Trumpian anger and delay any decisions by pushing the
issue into the boring bureaucracy in the hope that Trump will lose track
of it and the adults can take it over. In the meantime, maybe Trump will
get distracted by a novel pandemic or a shiny new canal and so forget
about their issue.

[This script]{.underline} had some merit [in the first
term,]{.underline} but even then, it [worked only fitfully]{.underline}.
[The Europeans used it,]{.underline} for example, [to try to get Trump
to stay in the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline} in 2017. They accepted his
view that the deal was flawed and initiated a U.S.-European bureaucratic
process to "fix the deal," led by Brian Hook in the U.S. State
Department. [Over several months, that process made impressive
progress]{.underline} and by the time French President Emmanuel Macron
arrived in Washington for a state visit in April 2018, they had
addressed basically all the problems with the deal that the Trump
administration had identified. When Macron met Trump, he praised the
progress made by Hook's team. [Trump]{.underline} looked puzzled and
responded, "Who is Brian Hook?" He [pulled out of the nuclear deal a few
days later]{.underline}. [As with Iran]{.underline}, if Trump's
obsession over Greenland persists, [the strategy of appease, delay, and
distract will at best just **kick the can down the road a
little**]{.underline}.

Worse, there is considerable reason to believe that [it will not do even
that in Trump 2.0.]{.underline} Trump may be the same man as in the
first term, but his administration is very different. He has largely
solved his personnel problems. He is installing loyalists throughout the
bureaucracy and purging those who might attempt delays. Soon, [there
will be no one left to pursue a clandestine agenda of alliance
management]{.underline}, [nor even anyone willing to redirect the
president's attention away from his more dangerous
obsessions]{.underline}. The focus for those that remain will be on
delivering for the president on his monomania of the day, no matter how
weird it appears to outside observers.

And all the signs since the election point to the idea that Greenland
will remain a preoccupation. Experience indicates that he is unlikely to
respond to reason or change his mind. In fact, [appeasement will only
convey weakness and **whet his appetite for more**]{.underline}.
([NATO]{.underline}, for example, [is now finding that meeting the 2
percent of GDP defense spending threshold has only increased Trump's
demands to 3 percent and even 5 percent]{.underline}.) Worse, Greenland
offers some intriguing business opportunities for Trump supporters and
even his family. As their business interests get wrapped up in the idea
of American ownership of Greenland, Trump's intransigence will only
increase.

A New Script for Europe

All of this is a potential disaster for Europeans. The issue is far
greater than whether Denmark will lose control over a gigantic, frozen
island with fewer than 60,000 people on it. Trump is in effect making a
Putin-esque argument that borders are inconveniences, sovereignty is a
fiction, and popular will matters not at all in the face of superior
might. If he succeeds, [NATO will become]{.underline} what amounts to [a
protection racket in which members pay the mafia don in the White House
not to trash one of their province]{.underline}s. Just listen to newly
installed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who many Europeans hoped would
be a moderating influence on Trump, insisting that "this is not a joke
.... \[I\]f we're already on the hook \[for defending Greenland\], then
we might as well have more control over what happens there."

[Europeans may wake up one morning soon to find out that they are now
more like members of the Warsaw Pact]{.underline} than members of a
democratic alliance. [The idea that under those circumstances, they will
be able to effectively negotiate with the United States on any issue,
from digital services regulation to tariffs to corporate social
responsibility seems almost quaint.]{.underline}

Denmark and **[the European Union]{.underline}** as a whole desperately
[need a new script for Trump 2.0.]{.underline} [They should]{.underline}
take a page from (supposed) Russian nuclear doctrine and [**escalate to
de-escalate**. Trump]{.underline}, after all, [is a classic bully: quick
to assert his power and threaten force, but **quite afraid of strength
and violence**]{.underline}. [The key to dealing with bullies is to
stand up]{.underline} to them [and respond with pressure of your
own]{.underline}. Beneath the bully's braggadocio, he is always more
scared than he appears. Once they see your strength and determination,
you can generally negotiate a deal.

This script is clearly hard for U.S. allies to follow. It is not their
habit to deal with the United States on the basis of power. It goes
against every norm of the Atlantic alliance and the habit of 80 years.
But those norms of behavior may in fact be the reason that Trump
reserves his most aggressive rhetoric for U.S. allies. U.S. adversaries
are used to standing up to the United States and counter-threatening it
in explicit terms. Trump, after all, has evinced little interest in
annexing provinces that belong to China or making Russia the 51st state.
Arguably, [Trump has more fun bullying America's friends than its
enemies specifically because the allies lack the habit of standing up to
U.S. bullying]{.underline}.

But, despite their dependence on the United States, Denmark and [the
European Union have many options to stand up to and threaten
Trump]{.underline} in return over Greenland. They could, for example,
announce an international conference on climate technology and mineral
resources in Copenhagen and invite the Chinese at a very high level.
(The visuals of that should be enough; no need to sell out the island to
Beijing.) [They could threaten to revoke U.S. mining licenses in
Greenland and refuse to consider new ones]{.underline}. (There is only
one currently, but they don't need to mention that.) [They could expel
U.S. forces from their military base in Greenland.]{.underline} And,
[with sufficient unity, they could declare their intention to **link the
Greenland issue** to any U.S.-EU negotiation over trade, tariffs, and
digital service regulation]{.underline}.

Of course, neither Denmark nor the European Union is likely to take any
of these steps. In the first instance, this is because they lack
sufficient unity. Denmark has shored up basic support within the
European Union, but more forceful measures would quickly test that
commitment. Some EU member states want to be Trump's best friend, and
many more are just happy he is focused on Denmark and not them.

But more fundamentally, [Europeans are still not ready to engage the
United States, their traditional ally and protector, in such a
hard-nosed fashion. As long as they are not, the bully will always have
the advantage. But if experience is any guide, such weakness will only
encourage more bullying. So watch out, Iceland, you may be
next]{.underline}.

https://www.csis.org/analysis/addressing-arctic-vulnerabilities) wtk

Any response to the changing Arctic security environment requires
addressing several key concerns. The first is analyzing the
vulnerabilities that impede the ability of Arctic states to credibly and
capably both deter and fight in the High North. At least partially due
to the absence of an independent command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR)
capability, [situational awareness is a vulnerability of particular
significance.]{.underline}5 [Arctic states are instead dependent on
vulnerable undersea communications infrastructure, or space-based
capabilities that are relatively scarce and characterized by
**intra-alliance dependency on the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates.6 Additionally, [Europe's reliance on Norway as
an energy provider is vulnerable to Russian gray-zone
tactics]{.underline}.7

The second concern is addressing these vulnerabilities, taking stock of
which technological capabilities will make a difference and how lessons
from the war in Ukraine can be efficiently applied to strategy and force
postures. [The most immediate priority to **alleviate Arctic security
concerns** should be bolstering maritime domain awareness]{.underline}
in the region, [which directly impacts European energy
security]{.underline} as well as nuclear security and deterrence by
enhancing NATO's ability to detect, monitor, and respond to potential
threats. Ukraine has demonstrated the utility and resiliency of advanced
space capabilities and unmanned systems when used in nonpermissive
environments. As Arctic geography already creates dependency on
satellites, investing in space capabilities should be a main priority.
Moreover, certain configurations of unmanned systems can
cost-efficiently bolster both situational awareness and offensive
options in Arctic security.

## Impact

### ! -- Nuclear war

#### Strategic autonomy is vital to stabilizing the international order -- prevents nuclear conflict

Guido **Montani,** 20**24** -- professor of international political
economy at the University of Pavia"A Vanguard for European Defence"
Social Europe, 12/4,
<https://www.socialeurope.eu/a-vanguard-for-european-defence> //DH

The ongoing [wars in Ukraine and the Middle East,]{.underline} serious
disagreements between wealthy and emerging nations on environmental
policies, the crisis within the United Nations, [and growing
international disorder]{.underline}: all these developments [are pushing
the European Union to seriously consider the need for a European defence
force]{.underline}. Though this idea was first introduced in the
Maastricht Treaty of 1992 and later reinforced in the Lisbon Treaty of
2007, it has largely been ignored. Recently, three reports commissioned
by the President of the European Commission (authored by Letta, Draghi,
and Niinistö) have revisited the topic of European defence from varying
perspectives. However, none of the reports delved into the institutional
aspects required for establishing a European defence force, a task that,
under the Lisbon Treaty, would be assigned to a new European Convention.
In November of last year, the European Parliament approved a
comprehensive reform proposal for the Lisbon Treaty that includes
suggestions for a European defence initiative. Yet, with the European
Council hesitant to consider Parliament's proposals, the question arises
whether a group of EU countries could move ahead independently, making
use of the Lisbon Treaty's provisions to build a European defence.

A Favourable Vanguard -- During a recent meeting in Warsaw (November 19,
2024), the [foreign ministers]{.underline} of France, Germany, Italy,
Poland, and Spain made a joint declaration stating: "we are determined
to stand united with our European and transatlantic partners to think
and act big on European security." The ministers [emphasized the need to
"to strengthen Europe's security and defence]{.underline}, using all
levers available to us, including the economic and financing power of
the European Union ... To this aim, we will ... discuss innovative
financing ... invest in our critical military capabilities, including
air defence, deep precision strikes, drones and integrated logistics, as
well in critical infrastructure and cyber defence, while investing in
research and development, and using new technologies."

As is often the case in European politics, such statements could end up
being merely symbolic. However, [they might also represent a first step
towards enhanced cooperation]{.underline}, as envisioned by the Lisbon
Treaty. Article 42 of the treaty states: "The common security and
defence policy shall be an integral part of the common foreign and
security policy. It shall provide the Union with an operational capacity
drawing on civilian and military assets." In line with this, a group of
member states could establish "permanent structured cooperation," which
would need to be approved by the EU High Representative for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy and then submitted to the Council for
approval by qualified majority (Article 46). Only Council members
representing the participating states would take part in the vote. The
EU would face three key challenges after such a decision.

NATO and the EU -- The main issue is the relationship between the EU and
NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, established in 1949, owes
its origins to the Atlantic Pact, adopted by the United States, United
Kingdom, Canada, and several European nations during the early years of
the Cold War. NATO is primarily a defensive alliance, with the United
States assuming a dominant role thanks to its considerable nuclear
arsenal. The supreme command of NATO is held by an American general,
while the secretary general is appointed by European countries. The
challenge today is reconciling American military dominance with the
European aspiration for "strategic autonomy." In 2016, High
Representative Federica Mogherini attempted to initiate "permanent
structured cooperation" between France and Germany but failed, likely
due to disagreements over the organizational structure of a European
defence and the difficult negotiations with the United States regarding
military command. These same challenges now re-emerge in an
international context that risks fracturing the EU, as some member
states express sympathies for powers such as Russia and China, which
could benefit from a divided and weakened Europe. Countries advocating
for permanent structured cooperation should demand shared military
command, split equally between an American and a European general. The
respective governments of the EU and the United States would then need
to negotiate the terms of cooperation, with additional agreements
required with Canada and Turkey. However, it is clear that a European
defence force led by an American general would not provide Europeans
with true strategic autonomy. Military independence is fundamental to
state sovereignty; without control over its military forces, the
European Union would effectively become the 51st state of the United
States.

The Federal Structure of European Defence -- European defence could be
organized based on the "dual army model" developed by the United States.
This model allowed the coexistence of state militias alongside a federal
army, a structure created during the American Revolution and later
formalized under the federal government. Such a "dual army model" could
also be adopted in the EU, as it would enable coordination of military
spending for the defence of the entire Union while allowing member
states to maintain their forces for national defence. The history of the
United States demonstrates that, after the world wars, federal military
power increased substantially compared to state-level forces---a pattern
that could repeat in Europe if international tensions continue to rise.
This possibility also underscores why [the EU has an interest in
revitalizing the United Nations, which]{.underline} currently [appears
to be in an irreversible crisis.]{.underline}

The United Nations and the European Union -- On September 22, 2024, [the
UN General Assembly]{.underline} approved the "[Pact for the
Future]{.underline}," which includes a detailed section on international
security. The document [highlights the alarming return of war, even
among countries meant to guarantee peace and security as members of the
Security Council]{.underline}. **[The threat of nuclear conflict looms
over humanity's future]{.underline}**. The Pact calls for respect for
international law, friendship between states, and the need for a new
"Agenda for World Peace." It advocates a culture of peace, reduced
military spending, and a nuclear-weapon-free world, stressing that "a
nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."

[A European defence force could contribute significantly to
international peace efforts in line with Article 21h of the Lisbon
Treaty]{.underline}, which states that the Union should "promote an
international system based on stronger multilateral cooperation and good
global governance." [If the EU were to make its defence resources
available to the UN]{.underline} Security Council (potentially reformed
and expanded) to reinforce the Blue Helmets' peacekeeping efforts, [it
would mark a significant step toward addressing global security
challenges]{.underline}---much in the spirit of Albert Einstein's 1947
plea: "Mankind must give up war in the atomic era. What is at stake is
the life or death of humanity. The only military force which can bring
security to the world is a supranational police force, based on world
law. To this end we must direct our energies."

[The international system]{.underline} established at Yalta in 1945,
which led to a world order dominated by two superpowers, [is
disintegrating]{.underline}. The Cold War ushered in a period of
relative stability, avoiding a nuclear confrontation between the United
States and the Soviet Union in 1962. The fall of the Berlin Wall,
facilitated by Mikhail Gorbachev's initiatives, allowed for a temporary
phase of missile disarmament in Europe. However, in the twenty-first
century, the rise of China as a formidable economic and political power
has heightened tensions between smaller and larger nations. [An anarchic
multipolar world has emerged]{.underline}. Russia's invasion of Ukraine
has brought war back to Europe---where, in 2012, the European Union was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for having "helped transform most of
Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace." Geopolitical
analysts now describe the current global disorder as a "Clash of
Empires" (Guénolé, 2025). [Will a **catastrophic nuclear war become
inevitable**? And who,]{.underline} if anyone, [will emerge as the
dominant global power?]{.underline}

The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States starkly
revealed a shift that had been developing for decades. At the end of his
presidency, Barack Obama remarked in an interview (The Atlantic, 2016):
"Almost every great world power has succumbed to overextension... Every
time there is a problem, we send in our military to impose order. We
just can't do that." Regarding European allies, he added: "Free riders
aggravate me." [Trump has]{.underline} since [made clear that US-EU
relations need to be reassessed, engaging in direct dialogue
with]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} to
negotiate potential peace in Europe---[without including the EU or
Ukraine]{.underline} in the discussions. [A new Iron Curtain may once
again divide Europe and Russia]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the European
Union has failed to put forward its own peace initiative, exposing a
**glaring power vacuum**.]{.underline} [This void will not remain
unfilled indefinitely; other global powers are waiting for the
opportunity to exploit the riches of the old continent]{.underline}.
[The EU must decide whether it will assert its influence or fade into
irrelevance]{.underline}.

[The EU's survival will depend on its ability to lead a coalition of
nations committed to rebuilding a peaceful international order. This
means revamping the institutions]{.underline} originally designed by
Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration ahead of the Yalta
Conference---the Bretton Woods system, the United Nations, and the World
Trade Organisation (initially the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, or GATT). The dollar has become an inflationary global currency,
enabling the United States to accumulate dangerous levels of public debt
and weaponise its financial system through economic sanctions. The UN
Security Council remains paralysed by competing vetoes, and the WTO's
dispute resolution mechanism is blocked, rendering international trade
regulation ineffective. Two urgent issues stand out for Europe and the
world: the creation of a European defence force and the reform of the
international monetary system.

European Defence

The EU's efforts to build a common defence face the same structural
obstacles as its Economic and Monetary Union. The Council of Ministers'
undemocratic voting system, in which any member state's veto can derail
collective decisions, has long hindered progress. In the late 1970s,
European monetary coordination began with the European Monetary System
(EMS), but it was only after German reunification that Berlin agreed to
establish the European Central Bank and introduce the euro. Similarly,
EU governments remain stuck in a deadlock over coordinating national
defence policies. Mario Draghi has criticised this approach in his
reports and speeches to the European Parliament, arguing that the EU
must evolve into a fully-fledged state. [A state is recognised on the
international stage only if it has an autonomous military force---a
European army commanded by a European general]{.underline}, under the
authority of a democratic European government. This would also
necessitate NATO reform: currently, NATO operates under an American
general, but European forces should be led by a European command
structure accountable to EU democratic institutions.

Such a [transformation requires political will within the European
Parliament and a financial commitment through dedicated EU resources for
defence. Establishing a European military is crucial not only for the EU
to speak with one voice on the global stage, but also to bridge the
political and cultural divides between the Union's western and eastern
members]{.underline}. Following the Cold War, it was essential to
integrate former Warsaw Pact nations into the EU to prevent territorial
disputes, as demonstrated by the violent breakup of Yugoslavia. However,
citizens of eastern EU countries have not experienced the same post-war
reconciliation processes as their western counterparts. Western
Europeans had to overcome historical enmities, as exemplified by
Franco-German reconciliation through the Schuman Declaration, which laid
the foundation for European integration. [The struggle to build a common
defence force could foster a shared European identity and patriotism,
cementing a supranational political community]{.underline}.

### \--AT: No collapse

#### Independent European leadership is the only hope of preserving the international order -- the perm relegates the EU to a junior partner role

Past is present. Home is abroad. Allies are adversaries. Faced with
Trump's doublethink, Europeans have no choice but to accept that nothing
works like it did before. [The president will conduct foreign policy
like he conducts domestic politics; he will eliminate, transform or
subjugate anything or anyone in his way.]{.underline}

As if this new reality of transatlantic opposition were not enough,
Europeans face the additional difficulty of still never knowing exactly
what they are up against. The Trump fog has settled, and it is
impenetrable. Is Trump really conducting a revolution, or is he just
raising stakes for negotiations? Is this a permanent rupture in the
transatlantic relationship, or is there a chance of future
recalibration? Is there a possibility of repairing some of the
destruction? Are there limits to what Trump can and will do? Should you
adapt and move on, or wait it out and hope?

To survive Trump's first presidency, European leaders resorted to
[appeasing him]{.underline}, delaying his decisions and distracting him.
That [will not work this time]{.underline} around.
[Europeans]{.underline} cannot just count down the days to the next
election. Instead, they [must acknowledge that nether America nor the
transatlantic relationship will ever be quite the same.]{.underline}
Whether they like it or not, Europeans need to play the hand they have
been dealt. Under Trump's adversarial leadership, the US will only align
with Europe when it suits the former's immediate interests. Otherwise,
the continent will be subject to his big transformational plan and
ordered to change. This implies [Europeans need to stand their ground
and adopt a much more confrontational strategy]{.underline}.

Europe's big response

[Trump]{.underline}'s big plan for America offers insight into how to
counter what he is doing abroad. He [is eliminating national and
international institutions; Europeans need to contribute to the
construction of a new world order. He is launching an all-out attack on
liberalism; Europe must become a haven of liberal democracy]{.underline}
and for its champions. He seeks to intimidate and crush dissenters and
opponents; Europeans must lock arms and diversify their options. In
short, Europeans need to respond in kind to the risks of elimination,
transformation and subjugation.

Reinvent

[Europeans need to reinvent multilateralism]{.underline}. Europe relies
on a functioning system based on cooperation for its own prosperity and
security. And [European countries have long enjoyed the role of **junior
partners** in building a rules-based order that has been crumbling
rapidly]{.underline} for the past decade. Now, [as Trump eliminates
constraints to his action, the **US is actively complicit in the demise
of the order**]{.underline} that it too has relied on for the past 80
years. [Europe will have to take a more active role in reshaping
it]{.underline}.

Europeans should work with other states to do so---whether they are
traditional allies, leaders from the global south or even China. This
coalition should aim to build institutions that do not concentrate power
in the hands of a few and that are resilient to populism. International
organisations cannot revolve around the post-second world war power
structure any longer. [Europeans need to help multilateral organisations
become places for]{.underline} citizens' deliberations on the (by
definition) [global challenges of public health, climate action, trade,
technology and international finance]{.underline}. These new (or
reinvented) international organisations should serve the interests of
the many, to ensure that the many contribute---including
financially---to their viability. European countries have spent 80 years
building multiple formats for horizontal cooperation on their continent;
it is time to apply this institutional creativity to global affairs.

[Europeans will have to help NATO evolve, given the overarching goal of
the Trump administration to renegotiate its terms in the
alliance]{.underline} (and despite the magnitude of the task). As the US
diverts resources back to America or to Asia, Europeans should offer to
"buy off" some US critical conventional capabilities. [They
should]{.underline} also seek to [develop **autonomous strategic
enablers**.]{.underline} [This could help the alliance's European
members show they are carrying a greater weight of their own
conventional deterrence.]{.underline} That, in turn, could help
strengthen their claim that collective defence across the Atlantic
remains beneficial to all parties in the long run.

Fight back

Europeans have no choice but to fight back (hard) against MAGA America's
efforts to transform their democracies. Foreign interference is not
acceptable, wherever it comes from. Europeans therefore need to align
more strongly to defend liberal democratic values and principles, ideas
that are rooted in their democracies and that sustain the West. In
negotiating with the US---over tariffs, Ukraine or anything
else---Europeans cannot lose sight of their own commitments under
international law. They should push back on potential human rights
violations and threats to their values. For example, Trumpists are
pressing the EU to relax its digital standards to fit the demands of the
US tech industry. In response, the bloc should double down on the
regulations its members decided on together and fight back using its
enforcement mechanisms.

The EU should also open its doors to US and international researchers,
activists, NGOs, and businesses seeking a place of freedom to pursue
their work. As the US government cuts funding for science, the EU should
increase its investment in innovation, academic research and supporting
public and private R&D and patenting. This could help strengthen the
European single market, European norms and standards and the rule of
law, thereby offering an attractive alternative to these great American
strengths of the "before times". Welcoming international researchers and
innovators could constitute the start of an escape for the EU from its
cycle of populist-influenced immigration strife over the past few years.

Diversify

Europeans should refuse to engage on the terms that Trump imposes on
them via his efforts at subjugation. [Under pressure]{.underline} and
blinded by Trump's anchoring technique, [some Europeans may be tempted
to push for a transactional relationship with the new administration.
But]{.underline} transactions with Trump are rarely fair and only
temporary. [Accepting degrading transactions will not offer Europeans
any guarantees that the transatlantic relationship will be
preserved.]{.underline}

Instead, the EU and its member states should continue to prepare
retaliatory moves and keep them ready in their back pockets. Not all of
these will turn out to be useful: the April tariff-reversal episode
shows that certain excesses from the administration will backfire
without Europeans even needing to retaliate.

In the long run, however, [Europe needs to de-risk from the US to be
able to resist potential coercive attempts]{.underline}. In line with
the EU's Versailles declaration, the bloc should reduce its reliance on
critical US suppliers (such as energy and technology companies). It
should seek to diversify sources for critical material in Africa, Asia
and South America, but also foster a stronger technological base at
home. European [de-risking]{.underline} from the US should not amount to
re-risking with China. Rather, it [should involve **pursuing the
ambition of European sovereignty**]{.underline}.

Europeans should diversify their partners and build resilience by
rallying countries that belong to the community of liberal democracies.
Canada does not want to become the 51st state; the EU should invite it
to join the European Political Community instead. Europeans should also
seek out other like-minded countries that have a vested interest in
building a functioning, rules-based order. Indeed, [Europe's
diversification efforts may be only just startin]{.underline}g.

Big plan, big battles

Trump's foreign policy resembles conquest more than chaos. His actions
abroad mirror his domestic crusade: to eliminate constraints, to
transform culture and to subjugate dissenters. Far from being collateral
damage in this battle, Europe has become a target. This has huge
implications for European policymakers. Without a big response, Europe
risks not just marginalisation but irreversible transformation.
Europeans need to come to terms with the enormity of a radically
changing America, and fight to find their footing in a radically changed
world.

#### EU independence is vital to filling the void of US retreat -- that's key to the international order

[Trump's lenient stance toward Russia could severely undermine European
security and the rules-based international order.]{.underline} While
debates continue within Trump's inner circle, several indicators suggest
what his approach might entail. His long-standing admiration for
Vladimir Putin, his claims of being able to end the Ukraine war within
days, and the perspectives of key advisors all point toward the
possibility of the United States reducing or even halting military
support for Ukraine. Such [a shift would risk solidifying Russia's
territorial gains, and a hasty peace agreement could lend legitimacy to
Moscow's aggression.]{.underline} Beyond threatening European security,
these actions would set a dangerous precedent by eroding fundamental
principles of the United Nations Charter, including the prohibition of
military aggression and the respect for national sovereignty.

[Trump]{.underline}'s second presidency [could]{.underline} also [have
devastating consequences for Europe's climate agenda]{.underline}.
During his first term, Trump denied the reality of climate change and
obstructed international efforts to combat global warming. The Heritage
Foundation's "Project 2025," a policy agenda for a potential second
term, explicitly seeks to end the "war on oil and gas" and dismantle
climate-related funding. Such actions would deliver a heavy blow to the
European Union's ambitions to lead global climate action through its
Green Deal initiative[. Without]{.underline} the support of
[Washington,]{.underline} [achieving global climate goals and creating a
new framework for climate financing would become much more
difficult]{.underline}. This divergence in priorities could further
strain transatlantic relations. [While it would still be possible to
address global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and
governance reform, the absence of a reliable US partner would make such
efforts far more challenging]{.underline}.

Given these potential developments, it is clear that Europe must prepare
for a new geopolitical reality. EU member states can no longer rely on a
return to the traditional transatlantic partnership. Instead, [Europe
must adopt a more]{.underline} confident and **[independent
approach]{.underline}** [on the global stage, maintaining its leadership
role in critical areas such as security, climate action, development
policy, and multilateral cooperation]{.underline}.

While Trump 2.0 would undoubtedly pose a threat to Europe, revisionist
powers such as [China and Russia]{.underline}---and some actors in the
Global South---[may view his presidency as a historic opportunity. A
partial withdrawal of the United States from the global order would
allow these countries to escape Western-dominated power structures and
play a greater role in shaping a multipolar world order]{.underline}
less reliant on Western values and norms. From a Western perspective,
this scenario poses the risk of deeper alignments between these nations
and powers like China or Russia, further weakening Europe's influence
within the global system and undermining the rules-based international
order.

Another challenge lies in the potential shift of US development policy
toward a more direct focus on geopolitical competition with China. If
this occurs, [Europe would likely face mounting pressure to fill the
financial gaps left by the United States, particularly in funding
mechanisms within the UN's development system]{.underline}. At the same
time, European nations would likely be pushed to increase their defense
spending, especially as Trump renews demands for NATO members to assume
greater responsibility for their security.

Trump's first term demonstrated his clear disdain for international
cooperation. The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and other
multilateral organizations was a stark indicator of his readiness to
pursue anti-globalization policies. In his second term, Trump would
likely double down on these tendencies, adopting an even harsher
approach toward America's rivals and adversaries. Based on his track
record, he could once again challenge institutions such as the United
Nations, NATO, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), even at the expense of
America's credibility as a global leader.

In sum, the implications of a second Trump presidency would ripple (or
has rippled) across the world, reshaping alliances, intensifying
geopolitical rivalries, and challenging the frameworks that have
underpinned global stability. For Europe, these developments underscore
the urgent need to adopt a proactive and self-reliant approach in
navigating an increasingly uncertain international landscape.

"End of liberal international Order?" Modern Diplomacy, 3/7

<https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/03/07/end-of-liberal-international-order/>
//DH

[The liberal international order]{.underline} may not be dead, but it
[is dying. Multilateralism]{.underline} too [is waning, if not on its
last legs]{.underline}. Globalization from above is, of course,
yesterday's story. For long, the US acted both as a guarantor for a
system of global trade and as a defensive umbrella for the Western
alliance. It cost the US billions, but it bolstered its image as a
preeminent global power. That is no longer the case. [Trump is now
ushering in a new imperial age with imperialist designs]{.underline}.

With the advent of Trumpism, it's not clear yet precisely what this new
operating system will look like. There is confusion all around. Many
strategic analysts believe [Europe is reliving a 1938
moment]{.underline}. It refers to a situation when bigger powers seek to
decide the fate of a country without its involvement. [In 1938,
agreements were signed allowing Nazi Germany to annex]{.underline}
German-populated territories in then-[Czechoslovakia, setting the stage
for the Second World War.]{.underline}

Finland's President Alexander Stubb warns, Europe has to choose between
the Yalta moment and the Helsinki moment. The Yalta moment marked a
division of Europe among the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union. The
Helsinki moment helped ease Cold War tensions. Some experts have
proclaimed the death of the Helsinki moment.

The world has turned upside down. As Simon Tisdall, columnist with The
Guardian, says, [Trump's world is a "disordered world of raw power,
brute force, selfish arrogance, dodgy deals, and brazen
lies]{.underline}."

[The US-Europe divide is a new reality]{.underline}. The phase of
liberal triumphalism is over. As Robert Kagan in his seminal book, Of
Paradise and Power, says, the United States and Europe are from
different planets. While the martial Americans are from Mars, the
pacifist Europeans are from Venus. Suddenly, they appear to be from
different centuries.

Marcel H. van Herpen, director of The Cicero Foundation, has identified
six dimensions of the growing transatlantic divide: a transatlantic
perception gap, a transatlantic capabilities gap, a transatlantic
attitude gap, a transatlantic value gap, a transatlantic religion gap,
and a transatlantic strategy gap.

Suddenly, Europe realizes that the world in which it felt cozy and
comfortable has withered away. How can Europe expect respect and demand
a sense of equality with Washington when 70 percent of all NATO spending
is American? Trump has told Europeans that the US would no longer
purchase European peace and prosperity with American blood and treasure.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio believes that the world is now
"multipolar" or is "inevitably heading in that direction." Which
multipolar world is he referring to? Way back in 2009, then Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton had also talked of the world's desire to move
"away from a multipolar world" towards a "multi-partner world.". [A more
realistic view of the current world is the advent of "multi-great
powers."]{.underline}

China's muscular rise, BRICS' growing clout, and now Trump's new
unilateralism and sovereigntist worldview in global affairs have
hastened the end of the liberal international order.

Europe is reconciling to a new reality: Europe without America. While
the US has snubbed and publicly humiliated Ukraine President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy, Europe is now embracing a "coalition of the willing" to
provide security guarantees for Ukraine. British Prime Minister Keir
Starmer wants Europe to "do the heavy lifting.".

[NATO is moving towards a post-America configuration]{.underline}. A
NATO without the United States would be possible, but it will face some
serious challenges. The Alliance heavily relies on the US for key
capabilities like operational intelligence, air-to-air refueling,
missile defense, and more. As George Allison argues, without "American
enablers," NATO's ability to sustain a long-term fight would be tested.
Moving tanks and troops around Europe effectively would still be a big
challenge.

Trump is readying America for both an economic war and a geopolitical
war of his own choosing. US Vice-President J D Vance bluntly said that
"there is a new sheriff in town" during his fiery speech in Munich. But
the moot point is whether Europe and the Global South will accept the
new sheriff.

The liberal international order is crashing amid an ugly face-off with
friendly leaders. [Great-power competition has returned with a
vengeance. The United States is pitted against China and maybe
China-Russia together. The US could also find itself against
Europe.]{.underline}

[Trump doesn't seem to bother anymore about alliances]{.underline}. But
[his]{.underline} abrasive-style [politics may destroy America's soft
power.]{.underline} The American Century started in 1945 and continued
for 80 years. American political scientist Joseph Nye doesn't see a
second American century, but he believes the US will be the preeminent
power for quite some time.

We are witnessing the end of a world order that was led by the United
States. Even the pretension of morality and ethics will have no place in
the new world order. As Adam Garfinkle, founding editor of The American
Interest, argues, "We are now living in a post-NATO world where black is
white, up is down, friends are foes (and vice versa), and
once-unthinkable impossibilities have become our new reality." German
foreign minister Annalena Baerbock calls it "a new era of wickedness."

Western nations have begun to realize that they can no longer prosper by
relying on an ever more globalized rules-based world order. That long
period is now over. Trump may be a symptom of its demise, but he is not
entirely responsible for bringing it about.

We are living a new moment of great uncertainty. Trump's explicit
rejection of multilateralism, disinterest in democratic values, broad
contempt for international organizations, and confrontational approach
toward China have accelerated these trends.

Bloomberg columnist Andreas Kluth visualizes a "new Yalta" moment when
Xi Jinping and Putin both could "make deals with Trump" on "dividing the
globe into spheres of influence." Some analysts predict Trump, Xi
Jinping, and Putin, and maybe Modi, will have a free hand to command
their spheres of influence in their regions.

The future world order could be one of uneven multipolarity, featuring
several major powers or regional blocs of unequal capabilities,
connected by flexible and fluctuating economic and security ties.

Trump's disdain for the multilateral order is compounded by his
transactional approach to international relations. America's withdrawals
from global commitments would mean the United States losing a key tool
of influence and leverage over other economies and other countries.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says that the national priority
must be securing America's own borders and deterring "communist China."
Trump likes to talk tough, but China works on capabilities. Tough talk
and public humiliation of allies may please the MAGA constituency, but
in today's world, you can't talk tough and carry a big stick. It remains
to be seen what countries will accept being America's servile partners
willing to accept a strictly transactional relationship.

The rise of China and the "rise of the rest" are two factors that have
weakened the West's domination. Washington will also have to acknowledge
the limits of its power. China has acquired the clout as well as the
economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to reshape the
international order.

Today, the Global South, BRICS in particular, has options it didn't have
in the past. If during the 1990s, BRICS sought to deepen their
connection with the Euro-Atlantic hub, they are now taking more steps to
tighten the relationship between themselves to bypass the West.

The world without the West is becoming preferentially and densely
interconnected. The Global South has been working to transform the norms
and values of the new international order that the West had consolidated
in the last few centuries. India and China have repeatedly criticized
how Western civilization has dominated the international order while
their own values are not seriously taken into consideration.

The Global South is not in favor of a world divided into a system of two
blocs and alliances. The bloc's system is not acceptable to most
countries. A large majority of the Global South may prefer to have
diffuse centers of power. Historical parallels can be deceptive. The
world is in a complicated multiplexed period.

It is also premature to say that Russia and China will form a bloc.
China may be interested in taking advantage of the present chaos. In
fact, Sergey Radchenko, a historian of the Cold War, argues that it is
difficult to say what China wants---to replace the current international
order or to undo it through a grand strategy.

We have entered what a major public opinion poll indicates is an "à la
carte" world where countries may choose the US in one area of policy,
China in another, and Russia and Europe in yet other policy domains.

[Trump's]{.underline} sovereigntist and [isolationist policies will be
counterproductive. The US can't be a superpower]{.underline} wielding
global influence by reviving America's sovereigntist tradition, whereby
it once rejected American membership in the League of Nations and
membership in NATO.

Trump's hostility toward NATO should hardly come as a shock. The
Republican Party has for long nursed deep skepticism towards liberal
internationalism. Organizations such as the United Nations, the
Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations are depicted
in the right-wing press as nefarious cabals intent on subverting
American sovereignty and independence.

[Trump has a poor record of peace-making. His Doha Agreement with the
Taliban was as feckless a piece of diplomacy as any in history, and his
negotiations with North Korea came nowhere near a denuclearizing deal.
His Ukraine gamble has failed]{.underline}, and Trump has suspended all
military aid to Ukraine.

Winston Churchill once boasted that "history will be kind to me," as "I
intend to write it.". Trump can't expect history to be kind to America,
nor will it be kind to the old continent. [The MAGA president may tear
down the edifice of the Western rules-based international order. But it
may prove to be a harbinger for the sunset of Trump's new Pax
Americana]{.underline}.

### \--AT: EU autonomy bad -- US leadership

#### Trump makes this inevitable -- he's sabotaging multilateralism and alienating allies

Célia **Belin,** 20**25** - Head, European Council on Foreign Relations,
Paris and Senior Policy Fellow "MAGA goes global: Trump's plan for
Europe" 5/7,

//DH

Trump also refuses to be prisoner of the past when it comes to the
United States' international commitments. The same way he is going after
the entrenched powers within the federal government, [Trump wants rid of
anything that attaches the US to international institutions or foreign
countries]{.underline}.

Upon taking office, [Trump]{.underline} promptly
[withdrew]{.underline}---again---[from the Paris]{.underline} Climate
[Agreement]{.underline}. This time, however, [he also opted out of the
W]{.underline}orld [H]{.underline}ealth [O]{.underline}rganization and
the UN Human Rights Council; and stopped funding UNRWA (the UN agency
for Palestinian refugees) [and the W]{.underline}orld
[T]{.underline}rade [O]{.underline}rganization. He then ordered his
secretary of state Marco Rubio to review US membership of all
international intergovernmental organisations, which could lead to the
end of the country's participation in the World Bank and the IMF. What
is more, [the administration plans to downsize the State
Department]{.underline}'s staff by 15% and to defund international
broadcasting efforts, such as Voice of America[. A leaked]{.underline}
April 2025 [memo suggested much more may be to come, such as eliminating
US contributions to the UN]{.underline}'s [and NATO]{.underline}'s
common funding [and shuttering dozens of]{.underline} American
[embassies]{.underline} and consulates all over the world.

The worst kind of foreign commitments from Trump's perspective are
military [alliances]{.underline}. They [make no sense to him, as the US
is bound to protect countries that are too weak]{.underline} to defend
themselves. These "weakling" states, meanwhile, thrive and compete
economically with their protector. Trump made this clear in his Playboy
interview: "We Americans are laughed at around the world \[...\] for
defending wealthy nations for nothing, nations that would be wiped off
the face of the earth in about fifteen minutes if it weren't for us."
Forty-five years later, Trump seems obsessed by the bad deal he is
getting out of NATO. If the US needed its NATO allies' help, would they
oblige? "Hum, I'm not so sure," he mused in April 2025.

Trump's scepticism over NATO is echoed in a new generation of American
policymakers, such as Dan Caldwell who joined the administration as an
advisor to Hegseth. Many such political appointees to Pentagon positions
have expressed a desire to restrain American foreign policy. They are
determined to shift US military resources away from Europe and back to
the US or to Asia. Central to this is an aim to change the United
States' relationship with its allies. A 1983 quote by Irving Kristol is
making its way around Trumpist circles: "dependency corrupts and
absolute dependency corrupts absolutely". Hegseth echoed this message in
his first address in Brussels: "The United States will no longer
tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency."

At the time of writing, this rhetoric had just begun to turn into
action. On April 8th, [the US announced it was withdrawing military
personnel from an aid hub for Ukraine]{.underline} based in the Polish
city of Rzeszow. Senior officials also proposed standing down 10,000
light infantry troops stationed in Poland, Romania and the Baltic states
over the rest of 2025. Transferring or offloading weapon systems from
Europe to Asia or back to the US may be on the next on the to-do list,
as suggested in a Heritage Foundation report by Alex Velez-Green (who
was appointed to the Pentagon by the new administration). These
strategic assets may include air and missile defences; ground-based
long-range fires; and critical enablers such as intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) drones.

Unsurprisingly, US commitments to Ukraine may be the single biggest
problem for Trump and his MAGA camp, as they see it as a conflict in
which America should never have been so involved. The war also forces
the US into an adversarial relationship with Russia at a moment when
Trump would much rather deal with the country on an equal footing to
discuss geopolitical challenges, in particular limiting nuclear weapons
arsenals. Having promised and failed to end the war in 24 hours, Trump
aims to obtain a ceasefire, however short, in order to claim victory and
turn the page. If he does not get his win, he may just walk away.

Finally, [Trump views free trade agreements as highly
burdensome]{.underline}. He dubbed April 2nd, the day he announced
massive hikes in tariffs across the world, "Liberation Day". This
implies the president does not find free trade freeing; instead, his
liberty to impose high tariffs on partners and competitors is the real
liberation.

In short, America will be ripped off no longer---either as an obedient
military protector or as a naive trade buddy. [Trump wants a clean
break]{.underline} from the past. And he wants it [whatever the cost,
whether that is trashing the federal state at home or **decimating
America's leadership abroad**]{.underline}.

#### Trump will inevitably appease Russia, destroy democracy and undermine allies. An independent EU can fill the vacuum

Célia **Belin,** 20**25** - Head, European Council on Foreign Relations,
Paris and Senior Policy Fellow "MAGA goes global: Trump's plan for
Europe" 5/7,
<https://ecfr.eu/publication/maga-goes-global-trumps-plan-for-europe/>
//DH

Trump's foreign policy is an extension of his domestic policy.
[Europeans are an extension of his political opposition at home---and
everyone is out to rip him]{.underline} and America [off.]{.underline}

In turn, the president is overhauling the way the US works at home and
functions abroad. His methods in both arenas are: elimination,
transformation and subjugation.

Abroad, this means [he is eliminating the ties that bind the US to
Europe, trying to]{.underline} transform Europe in his image and
attempting to [intimidate any transatlantic resistance into
submission.]{.underline}

[Europeans need to respond in kind]{.underline}. [They should reshape
the rules-based order to **salvage what they can**]{.underline}, [fight
back against the assault on their democratic model, resist coercion and
diversify away from the US]{.underline}.

Think big, act big

Donald Trump has never been one to shy away from the grandiose. "I like
thinking big. To me it's very simple: if you're going to be thinking
anyway, you might as well think big," he wrote in "The Art of the Deal".
He did a lot more than think in the first three months of his second
stint as US president.

Trump's first 100 days were record breaking. He signed over 140
executive orders, more than any other president at that point in their
term---including Franklin D. Roosevelt during the second world war. The
Trump administration faces a record number of lawsuits too, shattering
the president's own benchmark from his first term. His April 2nd mass
tariff announcement alone destroyed as much as \$10trn in stock values
in less than a week, equivalent to around half the GDP of the European
Union.

Consequences be damned, Trump is doing big things. And he is doing them
quickly, in domestic and foreign policy. The transatlantic relationship
is not exempt. The first quarter of 2025 saw an onslaught on European
interests: the indiscriminate tariffs, the pressure on Ukraine to accept
land losses, the support for nationalist voices in Europe. This is not
to mention the neo-imperial coveting of Greenland (and Canada). My ECFR
colleagues Majda Ruge, Jeremy Shapiro and I had anticipated some of
these disruptions. But the scope, speed and brutality with which the new
administration is implementing its agenda is astonishing.

In a mere three months, European citizens have come to barely recognise
their biggest ally. [America]{.underline} suddenly [seems ready to bend
over backwards for]{.underline} its strategic rival
[Russia;]{.underline} while mistreating its closest partners. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration also appears to have [launched an
all-out war on US society, dismantling]{.underline} the pillars of the
country's own liberal [democracy and abandoning its historic role as
leader of the free world]{.underline}. It is as if America and Europe
are not even on the same side anymore.

If it seems that way, it is because that is the plan. Of course, Trump
maintains his chaotic personal style. Just as he is undisciplined in his
speeches, he also goes off-script in enacting policy. He imposed massive
global tariffs which he claimed would transform the global economy, just
to pause them a week later because people "were getting yippy". He
promised to end the war in Ukraine in just 24 hours, and then threatened
to walk away from the whole thing. He tore up a functioning Iran nuclear
deal in his first term, but now says that he wants one back on the
table. What is more, his administration remains understaffed and is
undergoing brutal restructuring; political appointees hold at times
vastly diverging views. Prospects of petty gain mean policy directions
swerve overnight. It will therefore remain excruciatingly difficult to
predict US policy outcomes.

But, much like in his speeches, there is order in the chaos. Trump
intends his presidency to be deeply transformative, at home and abroad.
He promised his supporters as much on the campaign trail: he would have
to get rid of those who are destroying America or "\[we\] won't have a
country anymore". Anyone standing in the way---Democrats or
Europeans---will be confronted. The end point is thus clear, even if the
route is full of detours.

This policy brief shows that, beneath the capricious social media posts
and seemingly disjointed pronouncements, Trump's foreign policy has a
clear throughline: it is his domestic agenda, exported.

First, the paper analyses Trump's long-held belief that both liberals
and foreigners are ripping off America. From this conviction, empowered
by his MAGA-fuelled Republican majority, comes Trump's aim to conduct an
all-out assault on the bastions where the power of liberals and
foreigners resides, at home and abroad. Doing so, he claims, will put
the country back on the right track. Europeans are part of this and
cannot escape the brute force of Trump's one-size-fits-all policy.

Second, the brief shows where Europeans can find form behind the frenzy.
Trump is implementing a "big plan" to rid America of liberal and foreign
constraints. His highly political agenda is carried out by the many MAGA
ideologues, supporters, loyalists around him. The plan is all about what
Trump wants, but it is not just Trump undertaking it. Intentionally or
not, Trump and his [MAGA]{.underline} camp are using the same three
methods at home and abroad: elimination, transformation and subjugation.
At home, they seek to eliminate the "deep state", transform liberal
America into nationalist America and subjugate opponents into submission
or capitulation. Abroad, they [seek to eliminate alliances]{.underline}
and international commitments, [transform Western liberal democratic
allies into nationalist vassals]{.underline} and subjugate opponents
into exploitative transactions.

Finally, the paper explains what Europeans can do in the face of Trump's
apparent determination to crush them like he crushes his political
enemies. This time around[, Europeans cannot just appease
Trump]{.underline}, try to delay his decisions, [or distract him as they
wait for better days. A big plan requires a big response]{.underline}.
Instead, [they will have to **reinvent the rules-based order to work
without US leadership**]{.underline}, [fight back against the assault on
their democratic model, and]{.underline} eventually [diversify away from
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

#### EU autonomy is vital to stopping global authoritarianism and deterring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan

Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. "The
EU\'s Geopolitical Awakening: How the War in Ukraine Redefined Europe?"

//DH

While the EU has historically viewed China primarily in terms of
commercial and economic interests, [the invasion of Ukraine, including
China's response, has led many EU countries]{.underline}---at least on
paper---[to adopt a more assertive stance on China.]{.underline} Prior
to the Ukraine crisis, the EU had an approach of strategic ambiguity
toward China, in which they were not aligned but, as Merkel stated,
would try to avoid Cold War-style blocs in geopolitics. The
prioritization of commercial interests led the EU to become dependent on
China for raw materials and left its China strategy unclear. However,
[since]{.underline} the invasion of [Ukraine is seen as a matter of
democracy vs. authoritarianism, the EU views a potential conflict
between China and Taiwan through a similar lens,]{.underline} with
President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen stating that
[the EU's aim is to **deter China from invading Taiwan**]{.underline}.

[This highlights a shift from a foreign policy based on commercial
interests to one more focused on the battle between democracy and
authoritarianism, as the EU views Taiwan as a democracy while seeing
China as a hostile authoritarian state.]{.underline} [This entails the
return of liberal democratic ideology to the central role of European
foreign policy, as it sees]{.underline} authoritarianism and
[authoritarian states' efforts to reshape the world order through
coercive or illiberal means]{.underline}---which violate the
self-determination of other states---[as a threat to the liberal
international order, which is central to a free and just
world]{.underline}. Due to the Ukraine war, the EU now sees Taiwan and
Ukraine as part of the same battle and has therefore strengthened ties
with Taiwan to further support democracies and uphold the sovereignty
and self-determination of democratic societies.

The EU's increasingly vocal support for Taiwan was evident when French
President Emmanuel Macron stated in 2023 that the EU should not choose
between the U.S. and China over Taiwan and that Europe should "steer
clear of crises that are not ours." European politicians were quick to
clarify that Macron did not speak for the EU and that the EU supports
the Cross-Strait status quo and opposes any attempts by China to change
it by force. The backlash against Macron reflects the EU's commitment to
defending and strengthening democracy, as Macron attempted to undermine
the EU's liberal internationalist policy by aligning with autocrats and
faced criticism for comments that were perceived as an embrace of great
power realism. [The responses of many EU leaders]{.underline}, including
Germany, [point to the EU's commitment to preventing authoritarian
aggression, as it views Taiwan as an important democracy and a bulwark
against Chinese authoritarianism]{.underline}.

#### That risks extinction

Manager at the University of Cambridge\'s Centre for the Study of
Existential Risk "Collapse, Recovery, and Existential Risk," in *How
Worlds Collapse: What History, Systems, and Complexity Can Teach Us
About Our Modern World and Fragile Future*, p. 74-76. Accessed online
via University of Michigan //DH

[[A world dominated by totalitarian states would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
more incompetent, [[more war-prone]{.mark}, less
cooperative]{.underline}, and more inhibitive of progress [[than]{.mark}
one dominated by [democratic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our current
world is not particularly competent, peaceful, cooperative, or
progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. [[It would
increase the risk of]{.mark} another [collapse and
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} and could shape the future toward less
desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to
risks of collapse and extinction.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if ever) go to
war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [[a world dominated by
democracies has fewer wars]{.underline}.
[Miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}[ulation [might be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark} particular [[problem for totalitarian states due to
personalization and disincentives for accurate
info]{.mark}rmation,]{.underline} leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and [[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [being used]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.mark} than
democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg,
2020), [their [internal norms are characterized by
paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline} and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
[[This is bad for]{.mark} all [risks that require cooperation such
as]{.mark} [pandemics or climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, [continued social and [scientific progress is likely to reduce
risks of]{.mark}]{.underline} collapse and
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Social progress could reduce global
inequality and other risk factors. [[Scientific progress could help
address natural risks and climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sandberg,
2018), differentially increase defensive rather than offensive power
(Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), [[and solve safety challenges in AI or
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology (Russell, 2019).
[[However,]{.underline}]{.mark} as we will now discuss [[totalitarian
states would likely inhibit social progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, [democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. [A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---distorting the human trajectory.]{.underline}

[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which values
are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}" [some]{.underline} particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently faroff,
[future technologies such as artificial general intelligence, space
settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much better surveillance
could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[[A]{.mark} long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world
would]{.mark} extend the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened risk of collapse or extinction, as well as increased
potential for distortion of the human trajectory and the possibility
that a "[lock-in"]{.mark} event may occur]{.underline}. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," [[resulting in a
trajectory]{.underline} [with less or no scientific and social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark} [and a less favorable geopolitical
situation, [which would threaten the destruction of humanity]{.mark}'s
longterm potential]{.underline}.

### \--xt EU key to democracy

#### EU strategic autonomy is vital to countering global authoritarianism

Karn **Anutarasoti,** 20**25** - graduated from MSc International
Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. "The
EU\'s Geopolitical Awakening: How the War in Ukraine Redefined Europe?"

//DH

In 2022, most Western European countries sent military aid to Ukraine to
assist the threatened democracy in its defense against the Russian
invasion. This means the EU shifted its strategy from containing the
conflict, as it did in Donbas and Crimea, to attempting to prevent
Russia from reshaping the international order through more active means.
The military [aid provided to Ukraine has]{.underline} largely [been
effective in preventing Russia from imposing its]{.underline} political
and [geopolitical will]{.underline} on Ukraine. In October 2024, German
Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged €1.4 billion in military aid to Ukraine,
aimed at ensuring continuity in aid given the uncertainties surrounding
the U.S. election.

This highlights the EU's shift to a more assertive strategy on Ukraine,
as the aid serves as a security guarantee for Ukraine in times of
geopolitical uncertainty and enhances the Ukrainian military's ability
to at least maintain the status quo on the battlefield against Russia[.
This]{.underline} also [underscores the European Union's commitment to
defending the liberal order, as the increase in military aid is a clear
repudiation of Russia's attempts to shape the world based on spheres of
influence]{.underline} rather than self-determination. Even in Germany,
which has historically been averse to arms shipments to conflict zones,
the country has become the second-largest supplier of arms to Ukraine,
second only to the U.S. before Trump's return to the presidency. This
highlights a shift in the EU's strategy from viewing Ukraine as a
peripheral issue to one of strategic and ideological importance, as [its
approach now focuses on **countering authoritarian aggression** and
**defending threatened democracies.**]{.underline}

[After Trump's return]{.underline} to power and a rapid shift in U.S.
foreign policy away from arming Ukraine, [the EU has sped up military
aid for Ukraine]{.underline} and increased the amount of assistance, [as
protecting the liberal international order is an important part of the
EU's global strategy]{.underline}. The EU has accelerated military aid
to Ukraine to replace the U.S. aid that was cut off by Trump. This
highlights upholding the liberal international order as an integral
component of the EU's global strategy, as [such moves aim to prevent
illiberal actors from influencing the order through illegitimate
means.]{.underline} The importance of such strategic policies toward the
liberal international order is that EU-supplied arms will enable Ukraine
to resist being forced by Trump and Putin into a deal against its
consent, which would be a severe violation of the liberal international
order, where states' self-determination is paramount.

### \--xt democracy collapsing globally

#### Democracy is collapsing globally due to US authoritarianism

lecturer for the Department of Statistics in 2022. He is also principal

Power: The Case for a DIAMOND Alliance Among Democracies" 5/6,

But perhaps the most unsettling case has been the democratic backsliding
witnessed in the U.S.---the very country that for much of the 20th
century served as the chief architect and guarantor of democratic norms.
The [Trump]{.underline} administration marked a dramatic departure from
that tradition. It [attacked public institutions, delegitimized
elections, normalized disinformation]{.underline}, and embraced a
populist narrative that framed government itself as the enemy of the
people. The rhetoric of injustice and betrayal became a tool for elite
capture, creating an ecosystem of loyalty, grievance, and ideological
conformity.

In his second term, President Trump initiated a comprehensive overhaul
of the federal government, systematically removing officials appointed
by the previous administration. This included the dismissal of over
1,000 Biden-era appointees, such as the heads of the Transportation
Security Administration and the Coast Guard, as part of a broader effort
to realign the federal bureaucracy with his administration\'s priorities
. [The administration]{.underline} also [terminated]{.underline} 17
inspectors general across various agencies, effectively weakening
internal [oversight]{.underline} mechanisms. The Trump administration
also launched an aggressive immigration enforcement campaign, aiming to
deport millions of undocumented immigrants. This initiative involved
expanding detention facilities, increasing Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) operations, [and]{.underline} utilizing [expedited
removal]{.underline} processes [that bypass]{.underline} standard [legal
procedures]{.underline}. In the realm of higher education, the
administration withheld substantial federal research funding from
prominent universities, including Harvard and Columbia. These actions
were taken in response to the institutions\' resistance to implementing
certain policy changes demanded by the administration, such as
alterations to campus activism policies and diversity programs.
Collectively, [these measures reflect a concerted effort]{.underline} by
the Trump administration [to consolidate executive power, diminish
institutional checks]{.underline} and balances, and reshape federal
policies and priorities to align more closely with its agenda.

The political forces driving these actions have only grown more
entrenched. Populist movements once considered fringe are now fully
embedded within policymaking and media ecosystems.
[Trump\'s]{.underline} second-term [policies are]{.underline} not only
reshaping federal governance---they are [redefining the expectations of
democracy itself]{.underline}. His circle of influence extends far
beyond the White House, as former and current officials now mold
discourse in state legislatures, universities, and national think tanks.
[Their agenda reflects a systematic effort to dismantle oversight,
politicize law enforcement, and marginalize ideological
opposition.]{.underline}

The risk is not just political---it is strategic. [When democracies
adopt authoritarian tactics internally, they **lose moral credibility
abroad**]{.underline}. [Allies hesitate]{.underline}. **[Adversaries
gain confidence]{.underline}**. International institutions become
paralyzed not by external vetoes but by internal contradiction. [The
erosion of democratic institutions at home becomes a vector of strategic
vulnerability]{.underline}, no less dangerous than military imbalance or
economic dependence.

#### Authoritarianism is growing because of US democratic retrenchment

[The U.S., long the engine of democratic unity, has]{.underline} also
[seen its leadership questioned]{.underline}. In recent years, it has
oscillated between global engagement and strategic withdrawal. The Trump
administration\'s \"[America First]{.underline}\" approach unsettled
allies and [withdrew the U.S. from key multilateral
frameworks.]{.underline}

Although the Biden administration attempted to rebuild trust, many
international partners remained uncertain about the long-term
reliability of American commitments, particularly given polarization and
electoral volatility. Europe, though more consistent, faces its own
difficulties. The European Union has demonstrated principled leadership
in areas like human rights and climate policy, but internal fractures
have limited its strategic bandwidth. Member states differ on their
approaches to China, Russia, energy security, and military readiness. In
some cases, internal democratic setbacks---such as media restrictions in
Hungary or judicial reforms in Poland---have challenged the EU\'s
credibility as a model of democratic governance.

[Into this void have stepped authoritarian regimes]{.underline},
[seizing the initiative not only by projecting strength but by offering
infrastructure, investment, and influence at scale]{.underline}.
[Russia\'s intervention in Syria, China\'s digital Silk
Road]{.underline}, and Gulf states\' economic diplomacy [are examples of
how non-democratic powers are reshaping regional balances]{.underline}.
[They fill the strategic vacuum left by democracies that have failed
to]{.underline} speak and [act]{.underline} with collective purpose.

The cost of this vacuum is growing. It erodes international norms,
emboldens authoritarian actors, and leaves emerging democracies more
isolated and vulnerable. It also fragments the very alliances that once
secured peace and prosperity. The longer democratic states fail to
integrate their economic and strategic capacities, the more space is
ceded to regimes that do not share the values of transparency,
accountability, and civil liberty.

### ! -- Multilateralism

#### The EU can shore up the LIO through multilateralism

<https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/99/6/2281/7337073#424388404> // NN

[The affirming support for a rule-based order, free trade, effective
multilateralism and liberal values needs to be seen as the commitment to
shoring up the LIO and has remained a central pillar of EU foreign
policy.]{.underline} As summed up by Smith and Youngs: ['It is widely
presumed that the EU defends liberal order almost
reflexively,]{.underline} as part of its core identity and beyond
rationalised cost-benefit calculation'.44 Yet, this is not just a matter
of values and identity; [it is in the interest of the EU to defend the
LIO]{.underline}.45 [Particularly in spaces of intense security and
strategic competition, like the one between China and the US in the
Indo-Pacific, the EU has adopted a strategy of cooperation and defends a
rules-based order]{.underline} in alignment with the protection of its
mercantile goals.46

[In principle, the EU has continued to see itself as the main champion
of the LIO, especially as new challenges emerged with the rise of China,
a more assertive Russia and the US\' lack of commitment to
multilateralism and liberal democracy under Trump]{.underline}.47 At the
time, EU leaders denounced the US withdrawal from several international
agreements and institutions such as the Paris Agreement, the Iran
nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) and the UN Human
Rights Council. [For all the talk of the EU becoming a more 'realist'
and 'geopolitical' power, multilateralism and the defence of liberal
values have continued to be at the forefront of EU global
initiatives]{.underline}. Bátora, for instance, has argued that as an
interstitial organization, the European External Action Service---the
EU\'s diplomatic service---has been a vehicle for the elevation of the
liberal community and the kind of 'liberal international practices'
identified by Adler.48

[The E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [has gained a reputation
for being the strongest proponent and defender of the liberal global
order]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} is widely [presumed that the EU
defends liberal order almost reflexively, as part of its core
identity]{.underline} and beyond rationalised cost-benefit calculation.
[This ostensibly involves firm support for multilateral institutions and
norms; open markets and trade liberalisation; cooperative approaches to
security; and human rights and democratic values.]{.underline}

[With the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and other actors
increasingly ambivalent towards the liberal global order, the EU's
commitment to these norms is of unprecedented importance]{.underline}.
In some areas of policy, however, the EU's record in defending the
liberal order looks increasingly mixed. [Compared to the other actors
covered in this issue, the EU's trade, foreign and security policies are
indeed relatively strongly imbued with liberal principles]{.underline}.
Yet, in recent years the EU's own approaches to global order and
international challenges have adopted a more *selective* or *contingent
liberalism.*

Centred initially around the establishment of a common commercial
policy, the European Economic Community was from its beginnings
committed to the promotion of an open liberal trading order. However,
trade has become increasingly politicised. The Union has a major stake
in the continuation of liberal practices within the global political
economy, but has also become a centre of frictions, with tensions seen
in the EU's relations with major economic partners and in the rocky
interaction between the Union's regional and more global roles.

One illustration of these tensions lies in the EU's commitment to both
the idea and the institutions of multilateralism. [The Union has been
one of the cheerleaders for multilateral approaches to global governance
and regulation]{.underline}. Yet its record in practice has become
increasingly open to challenge. One reason for this is the clash between
the Union's commitment to multilateral rules and order, on the one hand,
and its own needs as an economic and political system, on the other. In
recent, crisis-hit years, the tensions have grown between the EU's
internal needs for economic recovery and the rules of the multilateral
system.

Multilateralism\"
bp347_niklas-helwig_eu-strategic-multilateralism.pdf)/LL

The 2003 [European Security Strategy defined \"effective
multilateralism" as one of the top priorities of the EU's external
action.]{.underline} Guided by its own experience as a regional
integration project, the [EU aims to "promote multilateral solutions to
common problems, in particular in the framework of the United Nations",
as Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union states. Whether promoting
human rights, ensuring rules-based international trade, fighting climate
change, or securing the non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, the EU's first course of action is to work closely with
partners in the multilateral system.]{.underline} Thereby, the EU
attempts -- with varying degrees of success -- not only to be
represented through its member states, but also to present a common
position behind an EU flag.

Almost twenty years later, the recently published Strategic Compass
admits that this approach to multilateralism "has come under strong
question- ing".1 [Great-power politics and a stricter interpretation of
national sovereignty are on the rise. International principles, such as
the territorial integrity of states or respect of human rights, are
under pressure, as the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the
suffering of the local population shows.]{.underline} At the same time,
t[he multilateral system is struggling to stay effective in the face of
a power balance shift towards Asia and the Global South]{.underline}. In
and outside the EU, governments increasingly highlight national
sovereignty, further complicating cooperation. [Faced with these
challenges, the EU is adjusting its approach to
multilateralism.]{.underline} In a joint communication in 2021, the
European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and
Security Policy laid out a strategy for the EU's multilateral engage-
ment by calling for a "more stringent and strategic approach".2 This
Briefing Paper analyses the central elements of this emerging strategic
multilateralism. [Under the weight of global competition and the con-
testation of international norms, the EU is adopting a multilateralism
that is less apologetic in the pro- motion of its interests, is
increasingly ready to put its economic and diplomatic resources to use,
and more problem-solving oriented when choosing frameworks for
cooperation.]{.underline} However, the risks of this strategic approach
to multilateralism also highlight the need for the EU to keep pressing
for reforms of the formal multilateral system, as led by the UN for
example.

### ! -- Nonproliferation

#### Strategic autonomy is vital to solving nonproliferation

European Integration at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Master\'s degree

START and the geopolitical (dis)equilibrium: what role for the EU?"
6/24,

<https://www.securitypraxis.eu/new-start-treaty-nuclear-weapons/> //DH

In this complex geopolitical scenario, what role can the EU aspire to
play? In 2016, the EU High Representative Federica Mogherini presented
'A Global Strategy for the EU', which mentioned for the first time '[the
ambition of strategic autonomy for the European Union']{.underline}
which also [involves the security defence sector]{.underline}. Since
then, [a number of unprecedented decisions have been taken]{.underline}
(e.g., the creation of the European Defence Fund and the envisaging of a
Permanent Structured Cooperation framework) [to pave the way for a
structural European defence policy]{.underline}. These major
achievements were unpredictable just a few years ago and are also the
consequence of the new American pivot to Asia and the resulting slow
disengagement from Europe. The combination of interconnected factors,
namely **[Washington's estrangement]{.underline}** and a more complex
international scenario, has [prompted the EU to start developing its own
security and defence strategy.]{.underline}

Recently, the EU High Representative Joseph Borrell welcomed the
extension of the New START and called for a new level of ambition in
nuclear arms control -- a sign that [the EU recognises the need for a
widened approach in addressing nuclear arms' proliferation]{.underline}
and that it has a common position on the issue. [Non-proliferation can
therefore represent a first point of convergence for EU member states to
start overcoming the political stalemates that are still present when
trying to shape \'strategic autonomy\' and pave the way for a new
international role]{.underline}. Moreover, Biden\'s sharp statement in
which he referred to Putin as 'a killer', stands in contradiction to the
expected appeasing approach, thus reflecting a fluctuating and still not
entirely defined American strategy. In other words, there is room for
the EU to act.

To do so, beyond the 'traditional' diplomatic efforts, [the EU can
leverage its presence in a number of international fora]{.underline}.
The Council of Europe, where Russia is a member and the US an observer,
focuses on human rights and can be the right forum to raise awareness
about the effects of atomic weapons on living beings. The OSCE
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe), which includes
the US and Russia, is the world\'s largest security-oriented
intergovernmental organization dealing with arms control and can
represent the technical platform to address the military aspects of the
issue. Finally, when enough attention is raised, the United Nations
constitute the most appropriate institution where such talks can be
developed. The EU can act as a first substantial engine to mobilise,
catalyse and merge interests through its unique type of presence in the
UN: thanks to its 27 EU members, plus the status of permanent observer,
and France, a nuclear state and permanent member of the Security
Council, it could raise a critical mass able to put a non-proliferation
multilateral dialogue high on the agenda. [By activating all the
appropriate international platforms, the EU can work to gather
interests, lead the discussion and have a seat at the negotiation
table]{.underline}.

The extension of the New START and [the need for a new agreement
represent an opportunity for the EU to take the initiative on the
topical issue of nuclear arms control, to position itself on the
international scene as a credible actor in the security sphere and to
lead a large-scale action to extend the negotiations, including
mid-level powers]{.underline} in the discussion in order [to achieve a
new, more inclusive and therefore more stable and effective,
multilateral agreement]{.underline}.

### ! -- EU tech sector

#### Strategic autonomy [spills over]{.underline} to the EU tech sector

Trump make European tech great again?" 5/16

//DH

Big Tech's battle with European regulators may ultimately be
overshadowed by the [Trump]{.underline} administration's
[destabilization of the broader Europe-U.S. security
relationship]{.underline}. President Trump's threat of using tariffs as
retaliation for EU tech regulatory policy is not happening in a vacuum.
His questioning of NATO's value, ambiguity over Ukraine, threats to
reduce U.S. troop strength in Europe, warming relations with Vladimir
Putin, and castigation of Europe's commitment to its own defense have
also [created a new ambiguity about America's commitment to European
security]{.underline}.

[European leaders are responding.]{.underline} French President Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline} has [called for European "strategic
autonomy]{.underline}." The new German Chancellor Friedrich [Merz
explained, "My]{.underline} absolute [priority will be to strengthen
Europe as quickly as possible so that]{.underline}, step-by-step, [we
can]{.underline} really [achieve independence from the
USA."]{.underline}

[These security concerns are **spilling over into the tech
sector**]{.underline}. In early March the Dutch parliament passed eight
resolutions with broad support urging the government to replace
American-made software and hardware. [If there is no stability in our
security]{.underline} and trade [relationships]{.underline} with the
United States, the argument goes, [is it still possible to rely on
American companies for essential digital services?]{.underline}

Europe defending itself

The threat of Vladimir Putin and the unpredictability of Donald Trump
have converged to redefine European security.

"Naturally, Russia's neighbors are most concerned by Russia," European
Council president Antonio Costa recently explained, "But what is
essential is for everyone to understand that this is a collective
threat." Germany's Merz lamented, "After Donald Trump's statements...it
is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this
administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe."

As a result, [Europe is mobilizing to reduce its security reliance on
the United States]{.underline}. Whether such strategic autonomy is long
overdue or a strategic mistake, Europe has begun to refocus its defense
capabilities to lessen the role of the United States and its companies.

[The European Commission's ReArm Europe Plan]{.underline}/Readiness 2030
[is the centerpiece of this shift]{.underline}. It proposes unlocking
more than \$860 billion for military investment, including approximately
\$160 billion in EU-backed loans. U.S. defense firms, that have
accounted for approximately two thirds of EU defense procurements, now
face a new reality: 65% of defense purchases funded by the loans must be
sourced within the EU, Norway, or Ukraine. As Politico reported, "United
States arms-makers are being frozen out of the European Union's massive
new defense spending law."

#### Autonomy revives the European tech sector

The [Trump]{.underline} administration was supposed to be a shield
against the profit margin impact of European regulation. Instead, it
[may have become the catalyst for Europe beginning to turn its back on
American digital technology. What began as a regulatory skirmish has
escalated into a campaign for technological self-determination that
threatens to cost Big Tech]{.underline} what they value most:
[growth.]{.underline}

Whether Europe succeeds in building a credible alternative to the
American tech stack remains to be seen. But it is already clear that
[the United States is no longer viewed as a neutral steward of digital
tools. In betting on]{.underline} Donald [Trump, Big Tech may have
provoked the very digital decoupling it hoped to avoid---and in doing
so, may have helped to make European tech great again]{.underline}.

### AT: Dollar hegemony

#### Dollar hegemony inevitably collapses under Trump

Fund. "How Low Can the Dollar Go?" Foreign Policy, 6/30,

//DH

In terms of shaking up the global exchange rate system, there is little
question that Richard Nixon serves as the closest analogy to Donald
Trump in his second term. Nixon's decision to suspend the convertibility
of U.S. dollars into gold on Aug. 15, 1971, upended the global monetary
system and presaged a disastrous decade of high inflation, low growth,
and the weakening of the dollar as European countries delinked from the
U.S. currency. Although the final chapter is yet to be written on
[Trump's]{.underline} international economic policies, the uncertainty
triggered by his [tariff war suggests a high risk that the dollar,
inflation, and growth will once again be casualties. This time, it will
be a renminbi bloc---China and the many countries for which it is the
major trading partner]{.underline}, particularly in East Asia but also
in Latin America and Africa---[that separates from its tight links to
the dollar, with the already existing euro bloc gaining market share at
the dollar's expense.]{.underline} [Cryptocurrencies are already eroding
the dollar's preeminence in the underground economy, which represents
perhaps much as 20 percent of global income]{.underline}.

#### Dollar collapse inevitable due to rising unsustainable debt

To be fair to Trump, [the dollar's dominance was already fraying at the
edges by the time he returned to office.]{.underline} As I emphasize in
my recent book Our Dollar, Your Problem, Chinese decoupling from the
dollar began in earnest in 2015 and in recent years has accelerated.

[The deepest vulnerabilitie]{.underline}s, however, [come from within.
The U.S. debt trajectory has become]{.underline} conspicuously
[unsustainable]{.underline} now that long-term interest rates have
inevitably risen from their post-financial crisis lows. [With little
apparent appetite in either political party to rein in debt, one
strongly suspects that nothing will happen until there is a crisis that
jolts the public]{.underline} into realizing the full dimensions of the
problem. Remarkably, after [Trump]{.underline} lashed out at President
Joe Biden's record 6.4 percent of peacetime GDP deficit spending
(outside of 2008 and 2020, when the global financial crisis and COVID-19
pandemic hit, respectively), his [deficits look set to be over 7 percent
for the rest of his term]{.underline}, even absent a deep recession or
another shock of pandemic proportions. [With U.S. debt levels already
exceeding 120 percent of income, future budgets are extremely sensitive
to the considerable risk of further rises in interest rates]{.underline}
from the ultra-low levels after the financial crisis. [If foreigners
pull back, and global demand for U.S. assets falls, the effect will be
to push up interest rates and make the U.S. debt situation even more
unsustainable.]{.underline} While a crisis, likely involving another big
burst of inflation or growth-stifling financial repression, is not
inevitable, the odds have been rising sharply and now seem more likely
than not over the next four to five years. It took a decade to stabilize
the U.S. economy after Nixon. Will the same be true for Trump?

#### Dollar heg collapse inevitable

American University. "Trumpism and the End of Dollar Hegemony" Modern
Diplomacy, 5/1,

<https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/05/01/trumpism-and-the-end-of-dollar-hegemony/>
//DH

Donald Trump, the current President of the United States, has placed the
global economy on a turbulent path with his controversial economic and
trade policies. The imposition of tariffs on imports, interference in
Federal Reserve monetary policy, and confrontational approaches in
foreign affairs have all shaken global confidence in the United States.
As a result, the dollar---long regarded as the world's primary reserve
currency---has come under unprecedented pressure. These "America First"
policies have not only disrupted international trade relations, but also
encouraged countries to reduce their reliance on the dollar, paving the
way for its declining hegemony. If this trajectory continues, the
dollar's position within the global financial system may be jeopardized,
potentially upending the current economic order. [History shows that no
reserve currency retains dominance forever. The British pound
sterling]{.underline}, once the leading global currency until the early
20th century, [lost its status to the dollar following]{.underline} two
world wars and [poor policy decisions]{.underline} by the UK. Today,
[America's erratic economic and political strategies may be setting the
stage for a similar fate for the dollar]{.underline}.

Under the banner of "America First," [Trump]{.underline} has [imposed
steep tariffs]{.underline} on imports from key trading partners such as
China, the European Union, and Japan. In the trade war with China, U.S.
tariffs on Chinese goods reached as high as 145 percent, prompting
retaliatory Chinese tariffs of up to 125 percent on American products.
While these tariffs were ostensibly aimed at protecting domestic
industry and reducing the trade deficit, they have in reality disrupted
global supply chains. According to a report by the Brookings
Institution, these policies have cost the U.S. economy about 0.5 percent
of its GDP and raised consumer prices. U.S. tariffs of 20 to 24 percent
on European and Japanese goods have also strained ties with
long-standing allies, pushing them toward strengthening trade relations
with non-dollar economies such as China and Russia. For instance, [the
EU recently signed new trade agreements with China, while Japan has
entered bilateral deals]{.underline} with India and Vietnam [to reduce
dollar dependence]{.underline} in regional commerce. [These developments
have reduced global demand for the dollar and created opportunities
for]{.underline} alternative currencies like [the yuan and the
euro]{.underline} to emerge as potential substitutes.

Trump has repeatedly and publicly criticized the Federal Reserve for its
refusal to lower interest rates, urging more expansionary monetary
policies to stimulate growth. Such political interference has raised
concerns over the Fed's independence and eroded global trust in U.S.
monetary decision-making. According to data from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), [the dollar's share of global central bank reserves
declined from 71 percent in 2016 to 68 percent in 2024]{.underline},
while China's yuan rose from 1 percent to 3.2 percent during the same
period. [This]{.underline} trend [reflects an increasing global
inclination toward currency diversification]{.underline} to mitigate the
risks of overdependence on the dollar. Diminishing confidence in U.S.
monetary policy is driving central banks to accumulate more stable or
non-dollar reserves. For example, India and Brazil have recently
announced plans to convert portions of their reserves into yuan and
euro. Although these changes may seem modest in the short term, they
could significantly undermine the dollar's dominance in the long run.

[Trump's confrontational foreign policy]{.underline}---marked by reduced
support for NATO and deteriorating relations with the EU---has [created
an unprecedented rift]{.underline} among traditional Western allies.
This erosion of trust has opened the door for economic rivals like China
and Russia to expand their influence. Through its Belt and Road
Initiative and yuan-based trade agreements with over 40 countries across
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, [China has chipped away at the dollar's
role in global trade]{.underline}. China's Cross-Border Interbank
Payment System (CIPS), now involving over 1,500 financial institutions
in 100 countries, offers an alternative to SWIFT and further reduces
dollar reliance. [Russia,]{.underline} particularly following sanctions
linked to the Ukraine crisis, has actively [distanced itself from the
dollar]{.underline}. Over 60 percent of its trade with China is now
conducted in yuan, and it has signed agreements with India and Turkey to
use local currencies. [These actions---mirrored by similar moves from
other countries---highlight a global trend toward reducing dollar
dominance]{.underline}.

Overall, many of the Union's Arctic policy objectives remain pertinent
in light of current challenges. However, its strategy could be
supplemented by adding another dimension to better reflect current
realities as this would allow the EU to better prepare itself in case
tensions in the region start to rise further. Nevertheless, it could
also be possible that [the EU is currently keeping a limited profile in
the region to not further upset Russia.]{.underline} Seven of the eight
Arctic countries are now part of NATO and [if the EU -- home to several
circumpolar countries and close partner of the United States and Canada

In addition, [Russia has been excluded from key collaborative

### Can't Solve Greenland

#### US investment in Greenland is key to cement key economic and military advantages

Diana **Roy and** Jonathan **Masters 25**- Senior Writer/Editor, Latin
America & immigration @ Council on Foreign Relations \| MA Candidate at
University of London, Jonathan Masters is a deputy editor at the Council
on Foreign Relations, and writes on national security and civil
liberties issues. \[ \"What Would Greenland's Independence Mean for U.S.
Interests?\", 3/13/25, Council for Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/article/greenlands-independence-what-would-mean-us-interests\]
EP

[Trump has repeatedly said that acquiring Greenland is critical to U.S.
national security]{.underline}. Greenland's location [between Europe and
North America and its proximity to the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans
makes it strategically important for military and defense
purpose]{.underline}s---**[particularly in monitoring increasing Chinese
and Russian military activity in the region]{.underline}**. While the
United States already has a military base on Greenland, [full control
over the island could enable Washington to expand its
influence]{.underline} in air and naval operations in the Arctic, as
well as space.

"[Greenland is growing in importance as we find ourselves in a global
competition with Chi]{.underline}na and in a new technological
revolution with regards to warfare," Rebecca Pincus, director of the
Wilson Center's Polar Institute, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
"So, **[Greenland is important from a missile-defense perspective, from
a space perspective, and from a global competition
perspective]{.underline}**."

There are also economic incentives. Rising temperatures associated with
climate change are making Greenland's rare earth metals such as lithium,
a critical mineral for electric vehicles and batteries, more accessible.
A 2023 report by the Danish government detailed [Greenland's potential
as a deposit of critical raw materials, many of which are used in the
green energy transition. (The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [currently relies heavily on China for rare
earth minerals]{.underline}.) [Greenland is also believed to possess
enormous untapped oil and gas reserves]{.underline}; a 2008 estimate by
the U.S. Geological Survey put the amount at approximately thirty-one
billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE)---the amount of energy contained
in one barrel of crude oil---though the island banned all oil and gas
exploration in 2021 over environmental concerns.

Meanwhile, [Greenland's ice sheet]{.underline}, which covers roughly 80
percent of the island, [is experiencing accelerating
melting]{.underline}, making Arctic trade routes more navigable; these
include the Northeast and Northwest Passages. [Greater availability
could potentially open up shorter and faster trade routes between Asia,
Europe, and North America, positioning Greenland as an international
maritime hub]{.underline}.

Trump's push to take Greenland echoes other territorial aims expressed
at the start of his second term, including regaining control of the
Panama Canal---which the United States officially turned over to Panama
in 1999---and making Canada the fifty-first U.S. state.

The United States could legally acquire Greenland with the consent of
the Danish government, which would also hinge on the agreement of
Greenland's self-ruling parliament. (The United States made such a
purchase when it bought Alaska from Russia in 1867.) Some experts say
[Washington could]{.underline} also [pursue a Compact of Free
Association with Greenland, establishing a relationship where the
territory is self-governing but still closely tied to the United States
for economic assistance and defense.]{.underline} The United States has
these treaties already in place with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands,
and Palau. However, such a deal would still require approval from both
the Greenlandic and Danish governments.

#### EU lacks the ability to invest in Greenland -- it can't provide necessary security for extraction and can't manage China or Russia

Sumantra **Maitra** 20**25** (Director of research and outreach at the
American Ideas Institute, senior writer at The American Conservative,

Nottingham, UK, "Time for a 'Big, Beautiful Deal' for Greenland", The

https://www.theamericanconservative.com/time-for-a-big-beautiful-deal-for-greenland/)//MC

To her credit, Nathanielsen understands that. In her Financial Times
interview, she mentioned that Greenland was "having a difficult time
finding our footing" [in a changing geopolitical landscape]{.underline},
as [the U.S. is considered just as predatory as China]{.underline}. She
considers the [EU]{.underline} as [a natural fit, and aligned on
environmental metrics.]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, that is the key problem]{.underline}. The [EU
is]{.underline} [simply not capable of investing the amount
required]{.underline}, [nor does it have the expertise or hardware
production capacity]{.underline}. EU [structures prohibit the degree of
research and development required]{.underline} to make Greenland a
mining and trading hub, a Singapore [on the Arctic]{.underline}. The
[Ukraine]{.underline} war [should have made it clear]{.underline} by now
just [how much the EU lags]{.underline} in hardware production.
Individual countries can invest, of course. Denmark and France are
investing in some mining in Greenland, but the amount runs to mere
millions of euros in total. European GDP, investment, research, and tech
was at parity with the U.S. up until 2008. [The U.S. dwarfs the EU
now.]{.underline}

Then there is this [question of security.]{.underline} [Arctic security
will be a headache to Europe in the coming decades.]{.underline} [Given
China's closeness to Russia]{.underline} and its material aid in the
Ukraine conflict, it is [unlikely that Europeans would
desire]{.underline} major Chinese [investment]{.underline} (and Chinese
or Russian intelligence-gathering[) in a place that essentially looks
over their northern trade routes]{.underline}. It is [not just an
American concern, but a European concern as well.]{.underline} Consider,
also, how the Chinese are increasingly wrecking strategic competition by
buying up assets. The case of British Steel and the [Chinese control of
Hutchison Port Holdings in Panama should be cautionary
tales]{.underline} for Europeans courting Chinese investment. [Without
any provision of American security but with potential
Russo-Chinese--aligned military interest, inviting such investment is
self-destructive.]{.underline}

### 2ac -- EU autonomy fails

#### Populism and leadership crises destroy EU leadership

Ecaterina **Moroz,** 20**25** - is a graduate of the KU Leuven Master of
European Studies: Transnational and Global Perspectives "The EU\'s Lack
of Leader Who Runs Europe?" Foreign Analysis, Spring
<https://foreignanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FOREIGN-ANALYSIS-SPRING-2025-1.pdf>
//DH

In this context, is the EU's leadership structure fit for the Herculean
tasks, or does its fragmented decision-making leave it struggling to
respond when a clear answer is needed? A leadership crisis is not just
the absence of strong personalities---it is rather a failure of
direction, coordination, and the ability to secure public trust. [In
the]{.underline} context of the [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion, [a leadership crisis manifests itself when
institutions lack the ability to project authority and inspire
confidence and stability]{.underline}. It is not about the lack of a
single, charismatic figure, but rather about whether the EU\'s
decisionmakers can both provide clear and effective governance and bring
Union-level politics closer to the citizens.

And while the European Union was never designed to be led by a single
figure, certain leaders in its history have played a key role in shaping
its direction and serving as "faces" of the EU. Jacques Delors, the
President of the European Commission from 1985 to 1995, possessed the
vision to lay the groundwork for the modern EU, the Single Market, and
the euro. Leaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, though
primarily a national figure, exerted perceivable and, most importantly,
recognizable influence over EU affairs, contributing to steering Europe
through crises such as the eurozone meltdown. These well-known names
represent examples of how leaders can set direction but, most
importantly, build trust internally and represent the EU externally.

Yet, over the years, [the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion's
[leadership has]{.underline} arguably [become less visible and more
fragmented]{.underline}. This is not entirely accidental---as the EU
expanded from its founding members to the current 27 nations,
decision-making became increasingly complex, requiring a redefinition of
power sharing. [The more voices involved, the harder it became for any
single figure to emerge as the face of European leadership]{.underline}.
The 2009 Lisbon Treaty reshaped the EU's governance, creating new
positions such as the President of the European Council, aimed at
limiting the prominence of the Commission President. While successfully
distributing power more evenly, the EU also made its leadership less
recognizable. The rise of [populism and nationalist movements across
Europe has weakened the authority of EU institutions]{.underline} even
further, as some national leaders frame Brussels in dictatorial terms,
antagonistic to the national interests of member states.

Instead of contributing to building a stronger EU leadership, [some
members have grown more reluctant even when it comes to competencies
already given to the EU, **leading to decision-making
gridlock**]{.underline}, [as in the current case of enforcing sanctions
against Russia and continuing to offer support to Ukraine]{.underline}.
And while this political strategy brings short-term electoral gains at
the national level precisely by exploiting the existing disconnect
between the Union and EU citizens, [it]{.underline} ultimately
[undermines the already weakened foundation of European cooperation,
alienating Europeans further from the EU]{.underline}. While populist
national leaders in some member states pledge to "regain" sovereignty at
the expense of acting at the Union level, the EU continues to face
problems that cannot be solved by individual action but instead require
an EU-wide response.

[Decisions on]{.underline} defense, the leveling up of [strategic
autonomy]{.underline}, migration, and financial reform often [become
trapped in prolonged negotiations. The lack of clear leadership has
direct geopolitical consequences as well, eroding]{.underline} the
[global influence]{.underline} that the EU tried to build over the last
decades. One of the very recent examples of this can be observed in the
approach of the new U.S. administration towards the peace talks on
Ukraine. The cabinet of Donald Trump has chosen to speak directly with
Russia, sidelining Brussels completely and leaving the EU to warn
against a "quick fix" and a "dirty deal" that cannot be implemented
without the involvement of Ukraine and the EU, as the High
Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,
Kaja Kallas, put it.

Since 2017, both French President Emmanuel Macron, former German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, and EU bureaucrats have stated on different
occasions that Europe should be self-sufficient and that there should be
a military power to complement the EU's undeniable economic power. Thus,
the initiative for a European army was reborn---this time with tangible
actions such as Strategic Autonomy, the European Army Project, and the
Strategic Compass Initiative. Second, [Europe has been
dependent]{.underline} on other powers and states [for its]{.underline}
own [energy consumption.]{.underline} Although energy dependency on
non-EU countries varies greatly between EU states, the average energy
import dependency rate was 63% in 2022. There is no exact number
demonstrating that the EU's dependency on energy from non-EU countries
has declined.

As frequently pointed out by the European Commission, the EU's [imports
from Russia]{.underline} have indeed [declined; however, this gap was
quickly filled by other non-EU countries]{.underline} like Norway, the
U.S., Egypt, Israel, and Azerbaijan. Moreover, it is suggested that
[Russian natural gas continues to be an important resource for some
European countries]{.underline} [due to the **internal conflicts** that
some EU member states are having with]{.underline} the supranational
administration in [Brussels]{.underline}. Taking all these developments
into account, one may argue that the EU has achieved some success in
reducing its reliance on Russian energy. However, [it remains dependent
on]{.underline} other major suppliers, such as [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [which the EU]{.underline} and its politicians
themselves have [labeled an unreliable partner]{.underline} following
President Trump\'s election victory. Third, **[internal divisions and
conflicts]{.underline}** within the EU [pose a significant challenge to
the bloc]{.underline}.

### 1ar -- political divisions n/u

#### Unanimity requirements fragment EU decisionmaking, making it incapable of responding in a crisis

European Studies: Transnational and Global Perspectives "The EU\'s Lack

//DH

Leadership in the EU has always been a balancing act between
institutions and national governments. But [when leadership is too
diluted, the system risks stagnation]{.underline}. The challenge ahead
is not just about finding strong personalities but also about creating a
structure that allows for decisive action while maintaining the
unparalleled complexity of the EU. The Union has strong institutions to
act; what it might need could be a representative of the whole
institutional structure---not a leader vested with extensive powers, but
rather a powerful and coherent presence, especially on an international
level.

Beyond leadership development, [structural reforms are necessary to
eliminate systemic obstacles to decisive action, as the EU's
decision-making process is often **slow and fragmented** due to
excessive **reliance on unanimity**]{.underline}. Transitioning to more
qualified majority voting in areas of security and foreign policy would
allow for swifter, more coordinated responses. [The EU]{.underline} also
n[eeds stronger crisis-management mechanisms that empower leaders to act
decisively when urgent situations arise, without getting lost in a
**bureaucratic labyrinth.**]{.underline} However, this would involve a
leveling up of the Union's competencies, to which member states might be
reluctant to consent.

[The problem of the EU is]{.underline} not the lack of leaders, but
rather [a lack of leadership resulting in political fragmentation,
waning global influence, and low public engagement]{.underline}. Without
proper reforms, [the EU risks becoming increasingly vulnerable to
**internal division** and external sidelining]{.underline}. A European
Union with a clear leadership structure, backed by functional
institutions and genuine public trust, would not only be able to respond
more effectively to crises but also reclaim its position as a decisive
actor in world affairs. The challenge ahead is not just about
strengthening institutions but also about revitalizing the European
project in a way that forges trust, unity, and resilience. Leadership in
the EU is not about strong figures; it is rather about strong
institutions and people with a strong presence to represent them.

#### EU leadership vacuum undermines autonomy

them,16/6/25/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/16/europe-trump-putin-eu-ursula-von-der-leyen/ZP)

[Donald Trump's "America First" policies are undermining decades of
transatlantic cooperation]{.underline} just as Putin's Russia
destabilises Europe with direct military aggression. But these twin
shocks have unintentionally accomplished something the EU institutions
never could. They [have made European integration feel not just
important, but existential -- a matter of democratic survival -- for

From Helsinki to Lisbon, people are suddenly [experiencing the same
existential unease]{.underline}. Trade wars, defence threats and
military aggression don't respect borders. More and more [Europeans now
recognise that their small, individual nations cannot withstand
simultaneous pressure from both Washington and Moscow. They find
themselves caught between economic coercion and military
intimidation.]{.underline}

Recent Eurobarometer data confirm the shift: [74% of
Europeans](https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3492) now view
EU membership as a positive thing -- the highest level of support ever
recorded.

This is a historic opportunity. And yet[, EU and national leaders remain
paralysed -- unable, or unwilling, to convert this public support and
shared urgency into political momentum for reducing Europe's dependence
on US military guarantees and economic shelter.]{.underline}

This is the real tragedy: [Europe's governments no longer practise the
very ideals they preach. Though the EU still speaks the language of
multilateralism and climate leadership, its policy direction and that of
most of its member states increasingly **mirror Trump's**.]{.underline}

The roadblocks ahead

But there are a range of challenges impeding progress.

[The Union is divided. Hungary continues to veto
initiatives]{.underline}, often backed explicitly or tacitly by other
governments such as Slovakia. [Consensus remains the EU's default
mode,]{.underline} making it easy for individual member states to block
collective action, even in areas of strategic importance.

Governance reform remains stalled. Despite repeated calls for treaty
change or at least more flexible decision-making, [there is little
appetite among member states to reform voting procedures, strengthen
supranational authority, or empower EU institutions to act more
decisively in times of crisis]{.underline}. Budgetary constraints are
tightening. [Many EU countries are heavily indebted, limiting both
national and collective financial firepower]{.underline}. The EU's own
budget remains modest compared to the scale of its ambitions. Proposals
for common borrowing, deeper fiscal integration, or sovereign investment
capacity face political resistance. [Without financial firepower, even
the best plans remain toothless]{.underline}.

[Institutional overload is growing. The EU increasingly finds itself
trying to do more with outdated structures and overstretched
capacity]{.underline}. Implementation bottlenecks and bureaucratic
excess persist and coordination between national and EU levels is often
lacking. And public support is volatile. While overall support for the
EU remains high, trust in institutions is uneven. Populist narratives
continue to thrive in several member states, and many citizens view
Brussels as distant, technocratic, or unresponsive. This weakens the
political mandate for deeper integration and enlargement.

Finally, shifting political majorities in the EU institutions are
already shaping a more defensive agenda. The political direction of
travel is regressive or counterproductive in some areas. Climate
ambition risks being scaled back, even though green leadership is a core
source of competitiveness. While attacks on civil society funding,
coming from within segments in the European People's Party, threaten an
integral part of a healthy democracy.

As is well known, [the EU derives its strength from its

perceive Russia: as a threat or as an inevitable partner.

Fourth, today, [there is a lack of leadership even at the highest ranks
of EU bureaucracy]{.underline}. The leaders of the most important EU
institutions do not come into office through a direct election by the
public but rather through selection by heads of state or formal
appointment procedures. This not only signifies that there is still a
democratic deficit---meaning that people have yet to be fully integrated
into the system---but also that one competence (for instance, foreign
policy or representing the union abroad) may be shared between two or
more officials in power. This, in turn, may further trigger leadership
discussions within the EU.

#### Empirically -- the EU is ineffective at managing global crises

The contradictions inherent in this position, and their i[mplications
for EU effectiveness in 'ordering' Europe, became even more apparent in
the next period, whose beginning was marked by the crisis over Ukraine
in 2013--2014.]{.underline} Both the eastern and the southern
'neighbourhoods' were in crisis, whilst the Union was challenged as
before by economic turbulence and the growing salience of nationalist
movements, especially in Hungary and Poland. [Whilst the 'hardening' of
EU security and defence policy gained momentum,]{.underline} especially
in areas related to defence industrial policy and (after the exit of the
UK) the development of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), [the
contradiction between growing diplomatic presence and qualified material
power remained.]{.underline} Diplomacy (and the EU's role as a 'market
power') could construct new forms of association agreements and
partnerships with countries bordering the EU, the collision between such
processes and the growing predominance of geopolitics was sharpened by
events in the Ukraine in particular. The negotiation of a Deep and
Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with Ukraine plunged the EU into the
domestic turmoil created by Russian intervention and the reaction of
EuroMaidan revolutionary forces. Russian intervention in turn confronted
the Union with a compelling need for the restora- tion of stability, but
at the same time with a sharp demonstration of the limits of diplomacy
without 'hard power' (Haukkala 2015, 2016; Averre 2016). [Alongside this
set of contradictions went others, arising from the EU's engagement with
its southern neighbourhood,]{.underline} of which the most intransigent
was the spill-over of regional conflict into mass movements of refugees.
This [created a direct and at times unmanageable linkage between the
internal order of the EU and the 'security perimeter' along which new
conflicts and crises were erupting, especially in Libya, Syria and more
broadly in the 'greater Middle East']{.underline}, creating conditions
[in which the EU would be confronted by an even more compelling set of
crises and tensions after 2020. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February
2022, it was not a sudden, spontaneous or unexpected challenge to
European order,]{.underline} or to the EU's role in establishing and
maintaining that order. [It was the culmination of a process that had
been established in the 1990s, had intensified in the first decade of
the new century and had exploded in the middle of its second
decad]{.underline}e. Shifts in material power, pressures on governing
institutions and challenges to received ideas about the nature of
European order had created a conjuncture in which the EU and its member
states would be tested as never before[;]{.underline} the response both
from the Union and from its member states was uncertain and often
faltering, infused as it was with contradictions in national and
European political processes, and with the resurgence of geopolitics
more generally (Cliffe 2022; Rachman 2022).

#### **The E.U. lacks economic integration sufficient to replace the U.S. as a global leader**

Theodore **Bunzel** **and** Elina **Ribakova**, 20**25** - \*Managing
director and head of Lazard Geopolitical Advisory and previously worked

Treasury Department, AND \*\*senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics and previous deputy chief economist at the

Bank in London. ("What Europe Needs to Lead", Foreign Affairs, 30 May
2025, <https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/what-europe-needs-lead>,
JP)

The truth is that [despite the EU's position as the world's
second-largest economy, the EU]{.underline} still [does not function
as]{.underline} a fully [integrated]{.underline} single market. Many of
the [barriers]{.underline} to economic integration [are
self-imposed.]{.underline} The [I]{.underline}nternational
[M]{.underline}onetary [F]{.underline}und [estimates that intra-EU trade
barriers could be equivalent to tariffs as high as 44 percent for goods
and 110 percent for services]{.underline}---and that a [reduction of
barriers in goods by ten percent could increase GDP by seven percent in
ten years.]{.underline} To break down these impediments to growth, the
EU needs to improve cross-border infrastructure (including in energy),
harmonize capital market regulations, and remove remaining intra-EU
trade frictions[.]{.underline}

Europe also needs to significantly increase public investment---and
coordination among member states---in strategic sectors such as critical
technologies and clean energy. [The scale of the challenge is
massive]{.underline}: [Draghi's report recommends ramping up public and
private investment in critical industries by]{.underline} up to 800
billion euros [(\$910 billion]{.underline}), or about 4.5 percent of the
EU's GDP. If the EU jointly financed its defense buildup, member states
could grow the EU budget to at least two percent of gross national
income, which would allow the bloc to leverage its single market to
raise revenue for more investment into strategic sectors.

Another opportunity for bold action lies in the area of financial
markets. As Washington frantically wields tariffs and looks poised to
add trillions more to the U.S. national debt, many investors are eager
for an alternative to U.S. assets and the dollar. The dollar is down
nearly ten percent since the beginning of the year, and the S&P 500 has
been flat this year while the European STOXX 600 has had a total return
of around ten percent.

To be sure, the euro will not replace the dollar any time soon. The
dollar accounts for 57 percent of foreign reserves and 54 percent of
export invoicing, compared to the euro's 20 percent and 30 percent. For
now, the euro lacks the liquidity that is essential for global reserve
currencies. U.S. Treasuries are the common language of markets in part
because of their size and liquidity: they account for \$28 trillion in
outstanding value with a turnover of almost \$1 trillion a day, compared
with 578 billion euros (\$657 billion) of outstanding Eurobonds with
only one trillion euros (\$1.4 trillion) in turnover a year. Large
investors prefer to invest in highly liquid assets that allow them to
transact in billions of dollars without moving market prices. Although
there is a lot of debt outstanding in Europe across different member
states, each individual country's debt has a different risk profile, and
historically that debt has been purchased and held to maturity.

But more common debt to fund European defense and other investments can
begin to provide the liquidity that international investors require to
become more comfortable with the euro. And as more investors look to
Europe, interest rates on the continent will fall, lowering financing
costs and stimulating further investment. Over the coming years, a
larger role for the euro globally could allow Europe to play a more
significant role in geopolitics, through the use of sanctions,
investment restrictions, and other tools of economic statecraft. As
Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, pointedly
put it in a speech this week, "Increasing the international role of the
euro ... would allow Europe to better control its own destiny."

Another challenge is that [European]{.underline} capital [markets remain
fractured]{.underline}. The rules and regulations governing investments
in Italy differ wildly from those in France, making investing
complicated. European leaders must accelerate [the EU's chronically
stalled]{.underline} "capital markets union" initiative (now called the
[Savings and Investment Union]{.underline}) to streamline the byzantine
financial market regulatory landscape across the EU. Doing so could
un[lock]{.underline} some of the [\$35 trillion in European household
savings tied up in low-interest accounts]{.underline} and direct them
toward investment, which would make Europe a more compelling place for
foreigners to invest in.

[If Eu]{.underline}rope [is to]{.underline} take a more assertive role
in global economic governance, [step]{.underline}ping [in]{.underline}
[where the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is stepping
back]{.underline}, European [leaders will have to develop an integrated
economic statecraft toolkit similar to that of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. An EU-wide agency modeled on the U.S. Office of
Foreign Assets Control may be the best option for centralizing sanctions
enforcement, but it remains politically unrealistic in the near term.
Instead, the EU should focus on strengthening coordination among member
states on sanctions, export controls, and investment screening.
[Enforcement of trade rules remain]{.underline}s [highly uneven across
the bloc]{.underline}. Greater [EU]{.underline}-level alignment would
not only reduce regulatory [loopholes]{.underline} but also
[offer]{.underline} a one-stop shop for businesses, cutting down on
[duplication and confusion.]{.underline}

[The EU]{.underline} also [needs to rethink its]{.underline}
decision-making [process]{.underline} in areas such as sanctions, where
unanimity requirements hamper effective action. (Take Hungary's recent
threat to veto the bloc's extension of sanctions on Russia.) An
emboldened European Council should extend qualified majority voting to
more policy areas, as recommended in the Draghi report. Even in the
absence of EU-level agreements, EU countries can choose to ramp up
cooperation among themselves and with non-EU countries, particularly the
United Kingdom, in areas such as sanctions and defense.

The EU can already fill the U.S. role in sanctions enforcement against
Russia. Beginning in the fall of 2024, the EU, together with the United
Kingdom, sanctioned more than 300 ships in Russia's so-called shadow
fleet, which comprises tankers with opaque ownership structures that
Russia uses to circumvent sanctions. That is 100 more ships than the
United States sanctioned. Europe has been able to identify these ships
and deny them access to ports and services such as maintenance. Actions
such as these demonstrate that Europe can act decisively when it
marshals its collective power.

The [existing multilateral institutions]{.underline}, such as the UN,
IMF, World Bank, and WTO, [will likely continue to function]{.underline}
in their roles [in promoting international cooperation.]{.underline}
However[, their]{.underline} institutional authority and [tasks will
overlap with the emergence of alternative institutions]{.underline}.
Countries frustrated by paralysis and divisions within existing
institutions may seek opportunities within new institutions and
partnerships that represent countries with similar strategic interests.
For example, China-supported institutions such as the AIIB and SCO, and
U.S.-supported institutions such as IPEF and QUAD, may compete for
international influence.

[The majority of countries in the world will likely continue to affirm
support for political democracy.]{.underline} However, [political
variations among "democracies" will likely increase,]{.underline} even
in the West. As a result, either the requirements of "liberal democracy"
may become relaxed, or "illiberal democracies" may become tolerated
under a broad framework of democracies versus explicit autocracies. NATO
already tolerates such ideological heterogeneity, as several of its
member states are viewed by others as "illiberal."

[The expansion of]{.underline} complexities and [uncertainties within
the international system may be mitigated by]{.underline} another
factor: the [strategic interests of countries in seeking geopolitical
stability through strategic alignment and constraints]{.underline}. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration, for instance, [may seek geopolitical
stability in Europe and the Middle East to strategically prioritize
China and the Asia-Pacific. U.S.-China strategic conflicts may be
mitigated by constraints designed to prevent mutually detrimental
economic and military losses]{.underline}.

However, [the basis for strategic stability and alignment will be a
transactional collaboration among countries with convergent geopolitical
interests]{.underline}. [Trump's signaling of diplomatic overtures to
Russia and North Korea may be a reflection of such a calculation:
that]{.underline} [a geopolitical order may be maintained by
strategically aligned states with different political
systems]{.underline}. The [dynamics of regional and international
stability may become more fluid and unpredictable, as individual
countries weigh and bargain over their strategic alignment]{.underline}.
Many countries in the Global South, for example, may engage in
transactional hedging between the U.S. and China, creating fluctuations
in geopolitical balance on certain international issues.

There are indeed geopolitical trends shifting the international system
away from the aspired goals and policies of the "liberal" international
order. What, then, is emerging as an alternative international system?
For now, [the international order appears to be evolving into a "less
liberal]{.underline}," "more eclectic," **[yet still U.S.-led
order]{.underline}** [where the superpower imposes restraints against
its lesser geopolitical rivals]{.underline}, albeit with changed
ideological priorities and strategies. Paradoxically, [such geopolitical
trends suggest the continuity of the "order" over the increasing
"disorder" in the contemporary international system]{.underline}.

#### Trump will maintain the current order and existing alliance structure; Russia and China can't contain the US

The geopolitical trends of competing geopolitical actors and
institutions, shifting political values, and transactional strategic
alignments will likely result in the transformation of the current
liberal order. However, such a [transformation does not assume the
dismantling of the international order into chaos, but rather an
evolution into a new version of the international order]{.underline}.
[One important continuity from the previous world order would be the
role of the United States in asserting global influence and utilizing
strategic alliances]{.underline}. To be sure, domestic political fatigue
toward "nation-building" and "peacekeeping" projects abroad has
galvanized political support behind Trump's "America First" slogan.

Yet, [Trump's second term, far from advocating an isolationist foreign
policy, appears to be committed to defending U.S. geostrategic
interests]{.underline} in the Western Hemisphere [and maintaining
strategic and technological superiority over China]{.underline}. [Many
U.S. allies will likely continue their strategic alignment with the
superpower. They may encounter contentious bargaining and pressures to
accommodate Trump's transactional demands. However, many U.S. allies
will calculate that in turn, their transactional benefits from the
alliance]{.underline} (even with reduced U.S. involvement in certain
policy areas) [will outweigh the costs and uncertainties]{.underline}.
[Skillful allies may also perceive the opportunity to attain their key
objectives through quid pro quo dealmaking with the U.S]{.underline}.

In contrast, [the alternative bloc of revisionist countries lacks
sufficient capacity to dominate the international order on an equal
footing with the U.S.-aligned bloc]{.underline}. [While fighting a war
in Ukraine, Russia has lost much of its regional influence in the Middle
East and Central Asia]{.underline}. Even after the war's end,
[recovering from the war's socioeconomic costs would constrain Russia's
geopolitical capability. China is falling behind in its quest to surpass
the United States, hampered by economic recessions and social
unrest]{.underline}. [Despite the expansion of its international
influence]{.underline} (through projects such as the Belt and Road
Initiative), [China has fallen short in consolidating strategic
alliances, as countries, especially in Asia, maintain wariness toward
its regional leadership]{.underline}.

[Should the current geopolitical trends result in changes to an
international system that retains the strategic superiority of a U.S.led
alignment over revisionist blocs]{.underline} but prioritizes mutual
strategic interests and transactional benefits over shared "liberal"
political principles and norms, [an international order that promotes
stability and cooperation may still function.]{.underline} Whether such
an order will be more effective than a "liberal" order may be open to
debate. The "less liberal" and "more transactional" world order may
struggle to facilitate long-term international cooperation for the
distribution of public goods.

[The geopolitical stability and balance maintained primarily through
shared strategic interests may be fragile and fail to deter certain
levels of conflict and disorder from continuing within the international
system]{.underline}. For those who may be disappointed by the prospects
of the decline of a liberal international order, perhaps [a hopeful
perspective is to view changes in the international system through the
lens of a swinging pendulum]{.underline}. In past decades, "[liberal"
endeavors to establish an international system have faced
challenges]{.underline} and resistance [that have caused trends toward
"less liberal" geopolitical models]{.underline}. Yet, [the limitations
of such new models may]{.underline}, in turn, [reinvigorate a new wave
of geopolitical changes toward the restoration of the liberal world
order]{.underline}.

(CN) --- [The transatlantic alliance has had its rough patches, but not

In the short time since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the
White House, [a]{.underline} great and [growing rift has opened up
between America and Europe and there may be no going back.]{.underline}

["It is unlike and worse than any hiccup in transatlantic relations
since the Second World War,"]{.underline} said Brigid Laffan, an Irish
emeritus professor of political science at the European University
Institute in Florence, Italy.

"It\'s very clear that [the Trump administration has a]{.underline}
particular visceral [dislike of the EU and therefore of Europe more
generally,]{.underline}" she said, "[and has turned traditional allies
of the United States into adversaries."]{.underline}

Manlio Graziano, an Italian geopolitics professor at Sciences Po and

divorce.

"Without doubt, we are at a completely new stage in relations between
the United States and Europe," he said. "I wouldn\'t yet call it a

rupture."

One thing is clear, he added: [Trust in the United States is broken and

because the United States wants to weaken Europe."

On Friday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance rubbed more salt in the wounds
by leading an American delegation to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish
territory that Trump openly talks about annexing, to the stunned
disbelief and anger of Europeans.

Every day, it seems, another plank in the transatlantic bridge falls
into the turbulent waters below.

#### A split's inevitable -- divergent security interests

**Bergmann,** 2/14/20**25** \-\-- director of the Europe, Russia, and
Eurasia Program and the Stuart Center in Euro-Atlantic and Northern
European Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(February 14, 2025, Max Bergmann, "The Transatlantic Alliance in the Age
of Trump: The Coming Collisions,"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/transatlantic-alliance-age-trump-coming-collisions,
IM)

To stave off a transatlantic rupture, it has been asserted that perhaps
the United States and Europe could cut a deal or strike some sort of
grand bargain. Europe, for instance, could make some concessions,
perhaps agree to purchase more liquified natural gas from the United
States, spend more on defense, buy more U.S. weapons, or make some trade
concessions, in exchange for a relatively placid relationship and the
continuation of the U.S. security commitment. But [a transatlantic grand
bargain is highly unlikely for the simple reason that the Trump
administration looks determined to remake the partnership in a way that
Europe will find unacceptable.]{.underline}

Reaching a grand bargain will require compromises on both sides,
including the Trump administration. The crux of the issue is that [any
bargain will be rooted in a continued U.S. security presence in
Europe.]{.underline} Thus, the question is whether the Trump
administration will be willing to leave the U.S. security presence in
Europe, and therefore, NATO, untouched as part of any deal.

Many incoming Trump administration officials, as well as U.S. companies
squeezed by EU regulations, want to use the U.S. security guarantee as a
tool to extract concessions from Europe on economic, trade, and tech
policy. During the presidential campaign, Vice President JD Vance linked
U.S. security commitments through NATO to looser European tech
regulation of Elon Musk's social media platform, X. Yet [the Trump
administration has made clear that it is determined to fundamentally
shift the burden of European security from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to Europe.]{.underline} This will likely mean a
significant reduction in U.S. forces in Europe. [The U.S. security
guarantee will only serve as bargaining leverage over Europe if it is
not materially weakened. Instead of making compromises, the Trump
administration will likely]{.underline}, and in many ways
understandably, [not want to choose or prioritize. Instead, it will
insist on Europe making major policy concessions, all the while also
shifting the defense burden to Europe.]{.underline}

Moreover, once the United States treats Europe's security as a hostage
to be negotiated over, there is no reason why the United States cannot
keep taking it hostage. For instance, should the European Union alter
its technology regulations, effectively passing a new law to appease the
Trump administration and to keep U.S. forces in place, what is there to
prevent the United States from seeking ever more concessions on other
issues, such as trade or carbon tariffs? The hostage---Europe's
security, in this case---is never actually released, as the United
States can always threaten European security by pulling back in every
follow-on policy clash.

What may also trigger tension is that [there is lack of
trust.]{.underline} [The Trump administration sees Europeans as feckless
and willing to say the right things, such as about defense spending, but
then failing to follow through. Europeans]{.underline}, meanwhile, [are
unlikely to trust the president to stick to any deal.]{.underline} The
mere fact that President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs against
Canada and Mexico, despite having negotiated the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) a few years ago, will likely
raise concerns about entering any deal with the United States.

Yet, [even if both sides wanted a grand bargain, there are major
structural obstacles. For the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [making difficult policy trade-offs across
sectors]{.underline}, especially between defense and economic areas,
[would be difficult for any administration. For Europe]{.underline}, the
structural problems are even more profound, as [economic and regulatory
issues are completely disconnected from defense policy. The power to
negotiate and retaliate on economic, regulatory, climate, and trade
issues resides with the European Union, and more specifically with the
European Commission, not with European member states.]{.underline} Yet
when it comes to defense and security issues, the power lies not with
the European Union but with member states and NATO. Member states can
push the European Commission and pressure its president, Ursula von der
Leyen, which could shape how the European Union responds or retaliates.
But they cannot force the European Commission to not implement EU law or
to change EU laws and policy. Moreover, [member states are a diverse
group and are **unlikely to** universally **agree** to cave to U.S.
pressure.]{.underline} Thus, [changing EU law and policy to satisfy
Trump]{.underline} and to ensure continued U.S. security commitment
[would be structurally very difficult for the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion to pull off, [even if many, if not most member
states, wanted to strike such a deal.]{.underline} France in particular
will seize on efforts to hold European security hostage for policy
concessions as unacceptable, and it will likely push back against the
efforts of other member states to pressure the European Commission to
soften its approach or change policy.

Lastly, [Europe's perceived weakness will likely lead the Trump
administration to underestimate Europe.]{.underline} On the one hand,
the clash with the United States comes at a terrible time for Europe.
There is political disarray in France and Germany. European unity is
plagued by internal Trojan horse states, like Hungary and Slovakia, that
block European unity. Europe is plagued by economic frailty and
stagnation. The continent is at its most insecure since the Cold War,
and it is as dependent as ever on the United States both for its
security and its energy supply. And yet, Europe's weakness is also
vastly overstated, especially by Europeans. Europe has shown again and
again its strength in unity when facing direct challenges to its union,
exemplified by its response to Brexit. Brussels is largely empowered to
act, and Europeans have shown a willingness to do whatever it takes to
protect themselves in crises.

#### Transatlantic relations are inevitably collapsing

Jim **Lobe**, 02-13-20**25**, Washington Bureau Chief of the
international news agency Inter Press Service. (\"Poll: Europeans see US
as \'necessary partner\' not \'ally\'\", Responsible Statecraft,
<https://responsiblestatecraft.org/europe-public-opinion-trump/> ) BAO

[Europeans]{.underline} increasingly [see the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as a "necessary partner" rather than an "ally,"
according to a new poll of 14 European countries]{.underline} released
Wednesday by the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The survey of more than 18,000 adults across the continent was conducted
in the weeks following the U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 5, in
which Donald Trump defeated his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.

Trump did not take office until Jan 20, although his skepticism about
transatlantic cooperation and NATO and his criticism of the European
Union during his previous tenure as president (2017-2021) and during the
election campaign were well known in Europe.

"[Our new poll highlights]{.underline} a remarkable shift in public
opinion --- and, as a headline, [the potential **death knell of the
Transatlantic Alliance**]{.underline}," asserted Arturo Varvelli, an
ECFR senior fellow who co-authored a report that accompanied the poll's
release. "[That Europeans]{.underline}, today, [see the United States
more as a 'necessary partner' than an 'ally' speaks to a collapse of
trust in Washington's foreign policy agenda]{.underline}."

Fourteen countries were covered by the survey, including Bulgaria,
Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal,
Romania, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and Ukraine. All of the countries
except the UK and Ukraine are EU members, and all except Ukraine are
members of NATO.

The survey and the accompanying report, "Transatlantic twilight:
European public opinion and the long shadow of Trump," also found that
Europeans believe that peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are
imminent and that the most likely outcome of the nearly three-year-old
war will be a "compromise settlement" in which neither country will
achieve its optimal outcome.

Majorities or pluralities of respondents in even what have been the most
hawkish countries, notably Estonia, Denmark, the UK, and Poland, appear
reconciled to such an outcome, although they also support continuing to
supply Kyiv with the weapons it needs to continue its fight.

Coincidentally, the poll's release came on the same day that Trump held
what he described as a "lengthy and highly productive phone call" with
Russian President Vladimir Putin centered in major part on ending the
war in Ukraine, characterizing it as the beginning of a negotiation to
end the war in Ukraine, and that his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
told a NATO meeting Ukraine's hopes of restoring its pre-2014 borders
were "unrealistic."

The poll also found that Europeans still see China less favorably than
the United States. An average of 43% of respondents across the continent
said they see China as a "necessary partner" or "ally" of the EU, 35%
said they regard it as a "rival" or "adversary." The most pro-China
sentiment was found in southern Europe, particularly Bulgaria, Hungary,
Spain, Romania, Italy, and Portugal. Majorities or pluralities with much
less favorable view were found in Germany, Denmark, the UK, and France,
respectively.

But [the most significant finding]{.underline}, according to the ECFR
analysts, [was the prevailing view in every EU member state and the UK
that the U.S. could no longer be seen as an "ally," but rather as a
"necessary partner."]{.underline}

That assessment held for respondents in even the traditionally most
Atlanticist-oriented countries, such as Poland where 45% of respondents
said "necessary partner" vs 31% "ally) and Denmark (53% vs. 30%), and
even the UK (44% vs. 37%), which has enjoyed a "special relationship"
with Washington dating back to the Second World War. Only 18 months
earlier, majorities in those countries saw the US primarily as an ally.

Those countries where respondents were most likely to view the U.S. as a
"necessary partner" included Ukraine (67% vs. 27%), Spain (57% vs. 14%),
Estonia (55% vs. 28%), Portugal (55% vs. 18%) and Italy (53% vs. 18%).

[ECFR's analysts viewed this shift as potentially tectonic and
attributed it mostly to perceptions of Trump based on his previous
administration and statements.]{.underline}

["Donald Trump's recent actions towards historic US allies show that the
Atlantic community is no longer underpinned by shared
values,"]{.underline} according to Jana Puglierin, a senior ECFR fellow
and co-author of the report. "In a world of Trump 2.0, transactionality
reigns[... For EU leaders, this will require a positional shift, away
from the Washington-led status quo, towards one that showcases internal
unity and an ability for Europe to exert its own influence on the world
stage."]{.underline}

Whether such a shift is possible, however, will depend to a significant
extent on whether such unity can be achieved.

Indeed, the poll found major divisions among respondents in different
members states of views regarding Trump. Asked whether Trump's return to
power was a "good" or "bad" development, respondents in southeastern
Europe, particularly in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, were more likely
to see the president as positive for their own countries and world
peace.

Conversely, [clear majorities in Denmark, the UK, and Germany said they
saw Trump's return as "bad" news for their own countries and world
peace.]{.underline}

#### Trump will escalate demands so Europe [can't]{.underline} meet them

of Trump: The Coming Collisions,"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/transatlantic-alliance-age-trump-coming-collisions,
IM)

[Europe will try desperately to maintain the status quo on defense with
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, ensuring European security
and staying engaged in NATO. The problem for Europe is that the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [appears intent on shifting
responsibility for European security to Europeans]{.underline}.

President Trump's talk of annexing Greenland from Denmark also raised
fundamental concerns about the U.S. commitment to NATO. If the United
States is seeking to take an ally's territory, it is hard to see it
coming to defend an ally's territory. At his first NATO Defense
Ministerial, Secretary of Defense Hegseth said, "the United States will
no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages
dependency. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe
to own responsibility for its own security."

This represents a radical shift in the United States' foreign policy
toward Europe. Since the 1950s, the United States has sought to play an
indispensable role in European security. As much as U.S. administrations
have complained about the lack of European defense spending and Europe's
limited defense capabilities, the United States has not supported Europe
working to organize itself militarily without the United States (this
has particularly been the case since the end of the Cold War, when the
United States aggressively opposed such self-organization). The United
States, across administrations, has been strongly opposed to the
European Union's involvement in defense. European dependence on the
United States has been seen as a feature, not a bug, of the current
structure of NATO, giving the United States a set of ready-made partners
and unparalleled influence in a large, wealthy, and technologically
advanced region. Yet President [Trump has shown little affinity toward
NATO and has repeatedly questioned its value.]{.underline} A new
generation of defense and foreign policy thinkers in Republican foreign
policy see the United States as overstretched and emphasize the need to
ruthlessly prioritize Asia over Europe.

[Trump has recently demanded that European countries spend 5 percent of
GDP on defense, which is much more than what the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [spends]{.underline} and a significant increase
from what anyone has been calling for; [it is]{.underline} also almost
certainly [unachievable for almost all NATO countries.
Trump]{.underline}, in short, [is laying out a demand that he knows will
not be met and that lays the groundwork for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to pull back]{.underline}.

The question now is whether and in which form that transition comes
about. It is highly likely that the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[will reduce U.S. force presence in Europe, with some reports of 20,000
forces being withdrawn]{.underline}. In a report titled the The
Prioritization Imperative, Heritage Foundation Research Fellow Robert
Peters and former Heritage Foundation scholar and current Acting Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy Alex Velez-Green wrote that the items to
be transferred "will likely include submarines and surface combatants;
heavy bombers; fighter, electronic attack, maritime patrol, and airborne
early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft; air and missile defenses;
certain ground-based long-range fires; critical munitions for air,
naval, and ground platforms; and critical enablers, such as airlift,
sealift, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
assets." [Such a shift will create enormous gaps in European defense. A
U.S. pullback and a move toward making the U.S. position in NATO
essentially "dormant]{.underline}," as conservative scholar Sumantra
Maitra notably called for, [looks quite possible]{.underline}.

### 2ac -- EU autonomy impact turn

#### [Strategic autonomy ends US primacy and dollar hegemony]{.mark}

William **Finnegan** 20**25**- [pseudonym used by a former senior
official in the George W. Bush administration, political scientist and
author of the Long Memo substack "Europe Is Preparing for a World
Without U.S. Leadership---Are We Ready for That?" The Long Memo, 4/7/25
https://www.thelongmemo.com/p/europe-is-preparing-for-a-world-without//LL]{.mark}

[The reality is that [this shift carries profound consequences for U.S.
influence, economic stability, and even national security]{.underline}.
What Trump is doing is playing "Russian Roulette" with our national
survival. [Each misstep, we spin the revolver, put it to our head, and
pull the trigger]{.underline}. Eventually, we're going to catch that
bullet. This is a question of when, not if.]{.mark}

[For nearly 80 years[, the United States has been the primary security
guarantor for Europe. This arrangement wasn't just about protecting
allies---it gave the U.S. enormous leverage over European political and
economic decisions]{.underline}. For a guy who claims to be a genius
businessman, the reality of this fact is ignored, or outright lied
about. We run the world the way it is because it benefits us. These
people aren't freeloaders, but our servants, or at least they
were.]{.mark}

[A[merican leadership in NATO ensured that European nations aligned with
U.S. interests, followed Washington's lead in global
crise]{.underline}s, and remained economically and militarily dependent
on American power. When that changes---[if Europe becomes a fully
independent military power---then the U.S. loses one of its greatest
strategic advantages]{.underline}. At best, we become a powerful actor
attempting to survive in a multi-polar world. At worst, the wealth,
power, prestige, and safety Americans enjoyed for five generations will
evaporate in less than a decade; all for lies, defamatory statements,
and capricious desires of a fatally flawed felon who was elected
President.]{.mark}

[The Loss of Strategic Leverage]{.mark}

[One of the biggest benefits of the current system is that the United
States, as Europe's primary military protector, effectively sets the
terms of transatlantic policy. That's why Europe has followed the U.S.
on key foreign policy issues---sanctions against adversaries, military
interventions, and diplomatic positioning. Despite all of the
"bullshit," and defamatory remarks from Republicans and Trump, [Europe,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan have followed the
U.S]{.underline}. Our allies have been there for us, economically,
militarily, and politically. They might not have done exactly what we
wanted, but not once have any of them ever stood opposed to us.]{.mark}

[[That's going to end]{.underline} thanks to the President.]{.mark}

[[A militarily independent Europe would no longer need to align with
Washington]{.underline}. Moreover, [it is doubtful that it will align
itself with our interests at all absent the security and economic ties
that have bound us for generations. If European nations have the ability
to defend themselves without U.S. assistance, they also can ignore U.S.
pressure]{.underline}. Donald Trump likes to talk about "Fuck you,"
money; in international affairs, military capability is "Fuck you,"
money.]{.mark}

[When Trump destroys the international framework, this is what Americans
can look forward to:]{.mark}

[Less U.S. control over economic policy -- [Europe would be free to
trade with adversaries like China and Russia without fear of U.S.
retaliation]{.underline}. [If Washington pushes for sanctions, Europe
could refuse.]{.underline} [That would effectively make the US's
leadership position impotent]{.underline}. While the US is the largest
market, it's only the largest as long as it controls trade and
economics. If it loses its leverage to coordinate the other developed
economies of the world, nearly half of our soft (and hard power)
evaporates with that choice.]{.mark}

[More divergence on military action -- Europe would no longer be
obligated to participate in U.S.-led interventions[. If America wanted
European support in a conflict]{.underline}---whether in the Middle
East, Asia, or elsewhere---[European leaders could decline]{.underline}
without fear of losing U.S. security guarantees. Even more problematic,
would be if Europe takes a position against the United States.]{.mark}

[A competing power in global affairs -- [Instead of working as
Washington's junior partner, Europe could emerge as an independent pole
in a multipolar world, negotiating its alliances and setting policies
that may contradict U.S. interests]{.underline}. While the US and its
allies have been aligned, in an environment where the U.S. is
antagonistic, Europe will undoubtedly move to undermine the U.S. In this
regard]{.mark}, Trump's legacy will be to have destroyed the ability of
the U.S. to be "the leader of the free world." [At best, we'd be
relegated to being just another voice. Again, that's "at best."]{.mark}

[An Economic Blow to the United States]{.mark}

[Beyond military strategy, this shift could have profound economic
implications for the U.S. Again, for a guy who allegedly is such a great
businessman, this is a self inflicted business wound without any basis
in fact other than MAGA's delusions and defamatory positions about our
allies:]{.mark}

[The weakening of the U.S. defense industry --]{.mark} European nations
currently buy TRILLIONS of dollars in American weapons [and military
equipment over a decade of time because they are integrated into NATO's
command structure. If Europe develops an independent military-industrial
complex, American defense contractors could lose billions in arms sales.
As it presently stands, I would expect Europe to completely abandon the
F-35 fighter. That loss alone will be tantamount to a loss of hundreds
of billions of dollars in revenue for America's A&D industry. The United
States cannot sell its top-line equipment to the likes of Russia or
China. For one, the Europeans would not allow it (they would sanction
and attack the United States), and for another, the Russians and Chinese
can't afford it even if we were reckless enough to lose our minds and
attempt to sell such weapons to them. The relationship we have with
Europe ensures that the United States A&D industry makes hundreds of
billions in revenues and that "the West" remains well armed with US
weapons. Again, this is a choice made by MAGA and the President, it's
nothing being driven by outside forces; it's a choice made by delusion
and defamation.]{.mark}

[A challenge to the U.S. dollar's dominance---[The U.S. dollar is the
world's reserve currency, in large part because American military power
underpins global economic stability. If Europe becomes a self-sufficient
power center, it is more likely that it will push for alternative
reserve currencies, reducing global dependence on the
dollar]{.underline}. "Eddies" could easily replace the "Greenback"
around the world; especially if the ECB and its leaders in France and
Germany are stable, and the US is led by an Orange Orangutan who imposes
tariffs without warning and flip-flops daily with no explicable
reason.]{.mark}

[A shift in trade relationships -- Without security dependence on the
U.S., European nations would be free to prioritize economic ties with
China, India, and other rising powers, weakening Washington's economic
influence.]{.mark}

[A More Unstable World for the U.S.]{.mark}

[For decades, U.S. foreign policy has operated under the assumption that
the transatlantic alliance provides global stability. A fractured
alliance means a less predictable world---one in which American leaders
can no longer assume that Europe will be on their side. We could face
France, Germany, and Britain in a conflict; especially if we're reckless
enough to align ourselves with Russia and China.]{.mark}

[This could manifest in several ways:]{.mark}

[[America could find itself alone, or at worst opposed, in major global
conflicts.]{.underline} If the U.S. engages in a standoff with China
over Taiwan, or a military confrontation with Iran, [Europe]{.underline}
could decide to remain neutral---or even act as a mediator rather than
an ally. Or worse, given power politics, they [could actively undermine
the U.S. Given their knowledge of our strategy, training, doctrine,
capabilities, intelligence gathering, etc., this would prove
FATAL.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[European military power could counterbalance U.S. economic interests.
[A militarized and independent Europe would have the capability to
challenge U.S. dominance in global institutions like the UN, the IMF,
and the World Bank]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[[Russia and China could benefit from U.S.-European
division]{.underline}. If Washington and Brussels are no longer in
lockstep, [adversaries could exploit the cracks in the Western alliance,
striking deals that weaken U.S. leverage.]{.underline} This means
Americans wind up poorer, less safe, and ultimately, relegated to being
a "nobody" in international affairs.]{.mark}

[As the global reserve currency since the end of World War II, [the US
dollar has been intrinsic to the functioning of the world
economy]{.underline}. The US dollar is so fundamental to the global
financial system that the political and economic ramifications of the
dollar's reserve currency status are rarely considered. The US dollar as
the global reserve currency is a subject of critical importance, both to
the understanding of the international financial system, and the wider
political and economic ramifications of the status accorded to the
dollar. As F. William Engdahl has explained,]{.mark}

> [[Maintaining the role of the US dollar as world reserve currency has
> been the foremost pillar of the American Century since

> encompassed the history of countless postwar wars]{.underline},
> financial warfare, debt crises, [and threats of nuclear war to the
> present]{.underline}. (Engdahl 2008)]{.mark}

[This article contends that [the dollar as the global reserve currency
has been crucial to the operations of US hegemony]{.underline} during
the post-World War II period. To investigate this issue, the theoretical
perspective of World-Systems Analysis expounded by Immanuel Wallerstein
(2011) is employed. The article also draws upon the theoretical work of
Henry C.K. Liu who developed the term "US dollar hegemony" (Liu 2002).
In this article, we argue that US planners from the Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR) in conjunction with State Department officials pursued a
deliberate plan to make the United States a global hegemonic power
(Shoup and Minter 1977) and the dollar was the central currency of that
hegemony (Engdahl 2008, 213). We demonstrate how the dollar evolved into
a petro-currency through Nixon's Saudi decision of 1973. The dollar was
placed on the trajectory that it would follow for decades and became the
source of conflict against the United States by its geo-political
competitors (Durden 2014). We conclude by arguing that [newly emerging
strategic competitors to US hegemony such as China, Russia and Iran are
growing dissatisfied with the current oil trading
arrangements]{.underline}. We do not argue that any of these nations are
remotely in contention to replace the United States as world hegemon.
However, we suggest that [a significant blow could be dealt to the
ability of the United States to maintain its hegemonic status should oil
trading be carried out in currencies other than the dollar
(]{.underline}Koenig 2015). If this were to occur to a large enough
extent, [the ability of the United States to exercise its foreign policy
would be severely curtailed]{.underline} (National Intelligence Council
\[NIC\] 2012). It would also demonstrate the critical importance of the
US dollar in the exercise of US hegemony. In this article, we would like
to move the dollar to the forefront of debate in understating how US
hegemony in the post- World War II period is constructed and maintained
and its critical importance in a hegemonic US global agenda.]{.mark}

### 1ar -- EU autonomy impact turn

#### EU autonomy will undermine U.S. global leadership -- disrupts critical military bases and cedes world order to China and Russia

Celeste A. **Wallander,** 20**25** (July/August, Celeste Wallander was

For," https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/beware-europe-you-wish-wallander) jiji

[For decades, the United States had asked its NATO allies in Europe to
do more for their own defense.]{.underline}  [And by the alliance's 2024
summit in Washington, they had gotten the message. Twenty-three
of]{.underline}  [NATO's 32 members were spending two percent of their
GDP]{.underline} on defense, the alliance target---up from  six members
in 2021.  

[In explaining this increase, many commentators cited a single factor:
Donald Trump.]{.underline} It is true that the  U.S. president's
rhetoric, broadly critical of European defense spending during his first
presidential term  and now his second, has played a role in the uptick.
But the increase was underway before Trump  entered politics. For over a
decade, [NATO allies have been focused on the elevated threat that
Russia]{.underline}  [poses to European security, with Russian President
Vladimir Putin's naked aggression against Ukraine as]{.underline}  a
[harbinger]{.underline}. They have also warily watched as Washington
paid less attention to their region and more  to Asia. Together, these
factors prompted the steady increase in defense spending, procurement,
and  production that helped Europe build more capable militaries before
Trump's return to the presidency in  2025---and that will continue after
he leaves office. Trump's reelection has only helped underscore the 
continent's burgeoning independence: Europeans now see a fundamentally
changed United States, and  they are no longer confident that investing
in U.S. leadership will secure their interests.  

[The fact that Europe is spending more on its own defense is in many
ways good news for Americans.]{.underline}  [Thanks to the continent's
increased strength, Washington can now focus on China first and
Russia]{.underline}  [second.]{.underline} There is a reason why
generations of U.S. presidents from both parties have pushed for Europe 
to spend more on defense.  

[But before American officials pat themselves on the back or take a
victory lap, they must understand the]{.underline}  [downsides of their
success. Growing European power means the era of comfortable U.S.
leadership is]{.underline}  [over. Now that it provides more for itself,
Europe will feel less pressure to defer to Washington's]{.underline}
 [interests. It is less likely to buy American-made weapons. It might
deny the United States the right to]{.underline}  [use American military
bases in Europe for operations in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. And
the]{.underline}  [continent is already holding up Washington's efforts
to end the war in Ukraine]{.underline}, restraining American  officials
in ways it previously wouldn't.  

None of this means the transatlantic alliance is doomed, let alone
already finished. Washington and  Europe still have many shared
interests, which will encourage them to keep working together. But the 
changing balance of power means that the United States now has to earn
Europe's partnership---just  when that partnership is becoming more
significant. [The United States is facing challenges on multiple  fronts
across the globe]{.underline} in ways it hasn't since the end of the
Cold War. It [will need its European friends,  with their newfound
strength, to help it handle aggressors in multiple regions. Washington,
then, has to make a decision. It can forge a new transatlantic
relationship that respects Europe's interests. Or it can  **lose the
world order to**]{.underline} a triumvirate of autocracies: **[Beijing,
Moscow, and Tehran]{.underline}**.

[For the first time since 1945, the U.S. risks losing its position as
the primary security guarantor of the West. That has profound
consequences. Let's talk about why. Let's talk about how, in less than
one presidency, America could dismantle seventy-five years of strategic
dominance---and what happens when the world no longer relies on the
United States to hold it together. Realism, Neorealism, and the Limits
of Cooperation To understand what's happening now---and why Europe's
potential shift toward military independence is so consequential---we
need to step back and look at the theoretical foundations of global
power. I realize most of my subscribers are super smart, but I doubt
many of you are political scientists (I am). So indulge me for a minute
as I give you a very brief version of the lesson I've given thousands of
poly-sci students in their "International Relations 101" classes. I
think it's important to have a background in the structure of
understanding how people "like me" think about what people like "Trump"
say and do. International statecraft is a discipline in and of itself,
with research, theory, scholarship, and practicum. So here's a brief
overview: Realism & Neorealism: Structures & Power (Everybody Wants to
Rule the World) For nearly a century, [realism has shaped how
policymakers and military strategists understand international
relations. At its core, realism is built on a few fundamental
principles: The international system is anarchic -- No global government
enforces rules; survival depends on power. States are the primary actors
-- While institutions like the United Nations exist, realists argue that
states act in their self-interest, and power---not ideals---dictates
global outcomes.]{.underline} National interest and power drive
decision-making -- Morality and ideology may shape rhetoric, but
security calculations ultimately dictate policy. Military capability
matters most -- In an anarchic system, security depends on strength.
Nations with military power set the terms of engagement. Hans
Morgenthau, one of the leading thinkers of classical realism, argued
that international politics is governed by the same forces that shape
human behavior---the will to power, competition, and self-interest. In
his 1948 book Politics Among Nations, Morgenthau laid out a stark vision
of world affairs: states act rationally to maximize power, alliances are
fleeting, and international law is often secondary to raw power
politics. By the late 20th century, realism evolved into neo-realism,
most associated with Kenneth Waltz. In Theory of International Politics
(1979), Waltz shifted the focus from human nature to the structure of
the international system as the key driver of state behavior. This was a
key observation, countries had no choice to act in certain ways. They
either understood the international system, or they perished (this was a
key distinction from "realism" scholarship prior.) Waltz argued that:
[The world is defined by balance-of-power politics---when one nation or
alliance grows too strong, others push back to maintain equilibrium. The
distribution of power (unipolarity, bipolarity, multipolarity)
determines global stability. States act not out of greed or aggression,
but out of necessity to ensure their own survival.]{.underline} For
Waltz, the post-Cold War era of U.S. unipolarity---the period when
America was the undisputed global superpower---was an anomaly. The
world, he argued, naturally tends toward balance, and that balance is
now shifting. Stephen Walt built on this framework with his balance of
threat theory. He argued that states don't just respond to power---they
respond to perceived threats. Nations form alliances based on: The
aggregate power of a rival (military, economy, population).]{.mark}

[Geographic proximity (neighbors feel threats more directly). The
rival's offensive capabilities (the ability to project force). Perceived
aggressive intentions (hostile rhetoric and actions matter). For
decades, Europe aligned with the U.S. under NATO not just because of
shared history but because the Soviet Union posed an existential threat.
After the Cold War]{.mark}, Europe continued to rely on the U.S. because
American power still provided stability and shielded them from a rogue
Russia as well as other perceived threats (Iran, China, etc.) [[With a
growing perception that the U.S. is an unreliable partner, Europe has
little choice but to reassess its alliances.]{.underline} According to
realists, the United States has moved from being an ally to being a
threat to stability (from the view of Europe) itself. Europe cannot
afford not to balance this threat. What About Institutions? The Limits
of Cooperation Realists argue that power dictates international
relations, but some scholars---notably Robert Keohane---have pushed
back. In After Hegemony (1984), Keohane laid out the case for neoliberal
institutionalism: institutions like NATO, the EU, and the UN help
stabilize global politics by reducing uncertainty, fostering
cooperation, and creating interdependence. Keohane argues [that states
don't just react to power but also calculate cooperation\'s benefits.
Even in an anarchic system, international institutions can constrain
states' worst impulses and create incentives to follow
rules]{.underline}. [But institutions only work if major powers respect
them. When a leading power---like the United States---begins undermining
alliances, questioning commitments, and disregarding multilateral
agreements, the credibility of those institutions erodes. And when
institutions break down, realism takes over. That's where we are
now]{.underline}.1 For decades, NATO functioned as a security stabilizer
not just because of military power but because the U.S. upheld the
credibility of its commitments. Now, with the U.S. openly questioning
NATO's purpose and treating allies as expendable, [Europe is reverting
to a realist mode of survival---preparing to ensure its own security,
independent of American guarantees]{.underline}. This is the moment
where realism reasserts itself. [NATO and other institutions won't
disappear overnight, but their role in maintaining security depends on
trust. And if that trust is gone, so is the system that has kept Europe
stable for nearly 80 years]{.underline}. The Implications of Realism
Today]{.mark}

[Realism tells us that alliances are not permanent. They exist as long
as they serve a mutual strategic interest. If Europe sees the U.S. as
unpredictable---or worse, a liability---it will act accordingly.]{.mark}

[If that happens, the global balance of power will shift in ways that
fundamentally alter the world order.]{.mark}

[Now, let's talk about what that looks like. Europe's
Reassessment---From Security Partner to Strategic Liability]{.mark}

NOT-SO-FREE RIDERS  

Ever since its 1949 founding, NATO has relied heavily on the United
States. During the Cold War, in the  1970s, Europe's NATO members spent
an average of two to three percent of their GDP on defense. The  United
States, meanwhile, averaged seven percent. As a result, [the most
capable military force  defending Europe was made up of American
troops]{.underline}. With some exceptions, European NATO militaries 
were underfunded. [Credible defense and deterrence against any Soviet
attack depended on  Washington]{.underline}.  

This might seem odd, given that Europe---not North America---would
suffer most immediately from  Soviet conquest. But preventing Moscow
from controlling western Europe when it already occupied  eastern Europe
was the necessary condition for American global security and prosperity.
The Soviet  Union's ultimate goal was to defeat the United States, and
control of western European economic and  industrial power would fuel
Moscow's ability to strike against its real enemy: an America built on 
democracy, a market economy, and global trade. Washington, locked in
competition with the only other  power that came close to matching it,
could thus not risk a third world war on the continent. European  and
American security were, in other words, indivisible. They constituted a
collective good.  

Because a collective good benefits all members of a group regardless of
who steps up to provide it,  there is little incentive for most members
to pay. But for the most powerful player, one with a huge  stake in
ensuring that the collective good is secure, contributing the lion's
share is perfectly rational.  After the disasters of two world wars and
a global depression, the United States was the only country  with the
resources to really ensure that Europe was defended from Soviet
occupation, and so it did. The  imbalance of defense spending was still
a source of friction in the alliance, but U.S. leadership was 
ultimately in Washington's own interest.  

[The United States got more than just a stable world order in exchange
for being Europe's protector. It  received a stockpile of military,
political, economic, and diplomatic advantages.]{.underline} Some of
these were  explicit and negotiated. Others developed naturally from the
structures and processes of the alliance,  and still others arose from
the determination of individual allies to support Washington one on one.
 (Each state gained unique benefits from its bilateral relationship with
the superpower.) All of these  advantages helped Americans.  

U.S. officials must realize the downside of their success.  

Consider [the most concrete benefit]{.underline}: the [more than 30
military bases]{.underline} the United States has set up [across
Europe]{.underline}. The legal status of these bases  is established in
bilateral agreements that dictate how, when, and whether the U.S.
military can operate from both the bases themselves and  the airspace
and waterways that allow access to them. These are called "access,
basing, and overflight," or ABO, agreements. Typically, [the  terms are
quite generous, allowing the United States to use the bases not only to
defend Europe but also to support American interests across  the
globe]{.underline}.  

Washington has repeatedly availed itself of this ability. In 1973, for
example, Portugal let the United States use an air base in the Azores
to  supply Israel during the Yom Kippur War despite the risk of economic
retribution by Arab states. In 2001, multiple European allies granted 
Washington permission to use its bases for operations in Afghanistan, as
well as the right to fly military planes through European airspace. 
Several NATO allies that opposed the 2003 U.S. war against Iraq
nonetheless allowed Washington to use bases in Europe for the
invasion---or at least permitted U.S. military aircraft to transit their
territory. When France did not, it was criticized by some members for
causing NATO  disunity. This is the essence of the United States'
hegemonic advantage, built over the course of 75 years of leadership:
NATO allies often  support American priorities, even when they disagree
with them, to preserve U.S. leadership.  

[The benefits of the United States' NATO hegemony continue to this day.
Washington's 2024 defense of Israel against Iranian air attacks 
depended on American military aircraft and ships based in Greece, Italy,
Spain, and the United Kingdom. European basing and overflight  enabled
the United States to destroy strike and command facilities operated by
the Houthi rebels in Yemen. And European bases support U.S. 
counterterrorism operations in]{.underline} the Horn of
[Africa]{.underline}.  

[These bases even help the United States protect itself. To reach the
northern Atlantic Ocean]{.underline}, for example, [Russian submarines
must first travel]{.underline}  from a naval and air base on the Arctic
Ocean [through]{.underline} a chokepoint known as the [GIUK
Gap]{.underline} (for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom).  [If
they succeed in evading detection there, they can move along the U.S.
coastline unnoticed, ready to launch nuclear weapons against  hundreds
of American targets without warning.]{.underline} Such an attack would
be extremely difficult to defend against. [The Pentagon is typically
able to  track these submarines through the gap, but **only because of
the many U.S. naval and air assets it has stationed in
Europe**]{.underline}. Washington is  helped in this task by patrols
from Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United Kingdom.  

#### European dependence ensures interoperability with allies and sustain U.S. defense industrial base 

Celeste A. **Wallander,** 20**25** (July/August, Celeste Wallander was

ONE-STOP SHOP  

The United States benefits from NATO leadership in ways that go beyond
basing. [For the alliance to  function properly, its members need to be
able to jointly plan, patrol, and carry out operations. That  means they
must use similar sets of weapons]{.underline}. And although [NATO
states]{.underline} are free to purchase any  systems that meet alliance
interoperability and capability requirements, in practice, they very
[often buy  U.S.-made ones]{.underline}.  

[The advantage of buying American is simple: European forces are more
effective at operating alongside]{.underline}  [U.S. forces when they
use American systems. Norwegian and U.S. NATO patrols in the GIUK Gap,
for]{.underline}  [instance, train on the same systems, especially the
Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, so that they can]{.underline}  [seamlessly
coordinate complex joint military operations.]{.underline} Poland and
the Baltic states have prioritized  the purchase of High Mobility
Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, because when their units and 
U.S. units need to hand off patrol duties to each other to ensure
round-the-clock coverage of NATO's  eastern frontline, operating with
the same equipment makes the process relatively frictionless. The 
Polish government is more likely to get American soldiers patrolling and
training with Polish soldiers  every day if they are all working from
the same weapons systems. American leaders, after all, will then  have
greater confidence that their soldiers will be effective and safe if the
troops fighting alongside  them are using the same technology. By
equipping European forces with American weapons, eastern  allies can
encourage Washington to keep its military in the region.  

[The reliability of the U.S. defense industrial base and the scale of
the Pentagon's long-term contracts]{.underline}  [offer additional
incentives to use American weapons. The American Foreign Military Sales
system is]{.underline}  [notoriously inefficient, with years-long
processes to finalize contracts and last-minute price
increases.]{.underline}  [But European countries still choose U.S.
military equipment over their own partly because American]{.underline}
 [defense contractors,]{.underline} accustomed to servicing the enormous
U.S. armed forces, are typically capable of  providing decades' worth of
maintenance, parts, and upgrades. This reliability is one reason why 
European countries have inked contracts for fifth-generation F-35
aircraft despite the high prices and  torturous timelines.  

[Europe's purchases help the United States maintain a strong defense
industrial base. From 2022 to]{.underline}  [2024, European countries
purchased \$61 billion worth of U.S. defense systems, accounting for
34 percent of all their defense contract procurement, according to the
International Institute for Strategic]{.underline}
 [Studies.]{.underline} The F-35 alone is worth billions of dollars to
U.S. defense companies. And these deals are  growing in size and scale:
since 2020, European NATO allies have more than doubled the number of 
weapons they import and increased the proportion they buy from the
United States from 54 percent to  64 percent. U.S. military contractors
are not just exporting more to European allies but also getting a 
larger share of the continent's defense spending pie. Yes, Washington
pays more for defense than  Europe does. But the United States has long
enjoyed its own benefits from this predominance.  

**European independence prevents resolving Ukraine**

Celeste A. **Wallander,** 20**25** (July/August, Celeste Wallander was
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International  Security Affairs in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy at the U.S. Department
of  Defense, Foreign Affairs, "Beware the Europe You Wish
For," https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/beware-europe-you-wish-wallander) jiji

For the United States, the upside of Europe's rise is easy to grasp.
Beijing is the primary challenge to  American security, so U.S.
officials want to prioritize it over Moscow. Now, they can.  

But [Americans]{.underline} may find that they [overcorrected in their
quest to get Europe to do more]{.underline}. Consider, for  example, the
manufacturing implications. With Washington retrenching from the
continent, Europe has  seemingly decided to buy fewer goods from
American defense manufacturers. Countries drawing from  the EU's new
\$163.5 billion defense procurement loan pool must spend the funds only
for purchases  from European defense companies. A senior EU official
told me that purchases from U.S. defense  companies might qualify if
their products are manufactured in Europe. Yet the contracts will
require  employing European workers and paying European taxes. Such
agreements could help American  production by creating more resilient
supply chains, but not if tariffs and trade barriers create obstacles 
for U.S. companies in Europe. For example, American companies have been
scouring the globe for  sources of ammunition fuses and explosives, many
of which European companies have been able to  source. But ironically,
that potential benefit could be undermined if new tariff rules label
these products  as European imports, even if they are ultimately
produced by American companies on the continent.  

[Europe's newfound autonomy is also causing strategic
difficulties]{.underline}. For instance, the [United States
wants]{.underline}  [to put a quick stop to the war in Ukraine, and it
has therefore argued for lifting sanctions on Russia in]{.underline}
 [step-by-step peace negotiations. Europe, however, does not want to
pressure Kyiv into an unwanted]{.underline}  [settlement. In the past,
Europe might have gone along with Washington's plans anyway, lest the
bloc  lose American support. But this time around, the continent has
declared that it will not lift sanctions  until Ukraine is ready to
settle]{.underline}.  

This has severely restricted the amount of relief American officials can
provide to Russia. Europe holds  two-thirds of the \$330 billion of the
Russian assets that U.S. allies agreed to freeze in 2022 to deny  Moscow
access to financing for its war in Ukraine. This means that the [White
House cannot dangle this carrot before Putin without European
permission]{.underline}. Europe is also home to SWIFT, the payments 
mechanism that is keeping Russian banks from gaining access to the
global financial system. The United  States could loosen sanctions on
the Russian energy sector, but since it is Europe that buys Russian 
natural gas through the now shuttered Nord Stream pipelines, [a change
in U.S. energy policy alone has]{.underline}  [little impact on the
Kremlin's purse strings. And Europe has significant sanctions on Russian
shipping and]{.underline}  [Russian access to dual-use technology goods,
which the United States can do nothing about.]{.underline}  

#### EU autonomy prevents US military intervention

Celeste A. **Wallander,** 20**25** (July/August, Celeste Wallander was
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International  Security Affairs in
the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy at the U.S. Department
of  Defense, Foreign Affairs, "Beware the Europe You Wish
For," https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/beware-europe-you-wish-wallander) jiji

[Other parts of the United States' Russia policy also depend on European
acquiescence. Washington, for]{.underline}  [example, wants European
countries to pledge to put troops on the ground in Ukraine to enforce
an]{.underline}  [eventual peace settlement. But Europeans have
demonstrated little interest in doing so as long as]{.underline}
 [Washington entertains Russia's demands]{.underline}. Unlike the United
States, for example, the vast majority of  European countries will not
concede that Russia should be able to dictate whether Ukraine can be a 
member of NATO---not least because Putin has stated that a peace
settlement with Kyiv should also  revisit previous rounds of NATO's
enlargement.  

[If a sense of a common transatlantic purpose continues to fray, Europe
might wind up undermining  Washington's objectives elsewhere in the
world. Should the United States decide to conduct a major  military
campaign against Iran's nuclear facilities]{.underline}, for example,
[it will want to use its military bases in  Europe. This would require
seeking permission from European countries]{.underline}. [Those
governments will know]{.underline}  [that their granting Washington's
request will guarantee massive protests all over the continent. But
in]{.underline}  [contrast to their actions in the run-up to the U.S.
invasion of Iraq in 2003, many European countries]{.underline}  [might
refuse. Washington would then either have to start its offensive from
far-off bases in the United]{.underline}  [States---or from partner
bases in the Middle East, which are easier for Iran to hit than bases in
Europe.]{.underline}  

[As long as NATO remains strong, the United States will probably be able
to keep using its bases in]{.underline}  [Europe for self-defense.
Protecting North America is written into the alliance's charter. But
European]{.underline}  [countries may no longer trust that Washington
will defend them should the need arise. As a result,]{.underline}
 [European leaders are seriously discussing whether the continent should
acquire its own credible nuclear]{.underline} [deterrent.]{.underline}
France and the United Kingdom both have nuclear weapons, but neither
currently has the  number of warheads and the variety in delivery
vehicles that the U.S. arsenal does, or the strategic  depth.
(Washington, for example, is separated from its competitors by vast
oceans.) The United States  claims it has no intention of pulling its
nuclear umbrella from Europe or ignoring Article 5 of the NATO  treaty,
which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack
on all. But Washington's  NATO policy seems to change every day, and
Europe does not have the time to wait and see if the  Americans will
actually uphold their commitments.  

### AT: Democracy impact

#### Transactionalism won't rollback democracy

Similar to the practice of realpolitik during the Cold War period,
[strategic interests may be more openly prioritized over strict
adherence to "liberal" political principles in the evolved international
order]{.underline}. [Some countries may welcome diplomacy based on
strategic interests as more authentic and credible than ostentatious
value-based or moral-based diplomacy]{.underline}. However, [a complete
return to an unrestrained "illiberal" international system appears less
likely. Liberal political values such as democracy, human rights, and
the rule of law will still be practiced by multiple
countries]{.underline}, and their governments' (or populaces') political
sensitivity will remain a consideration in geopolitical decisions.

To conclude, I predict that [the international order is currently
trending toward a still largely U.S.-alliance-led system, but one that
is less liberal and more restrained in its goals and
aspirations]{.underline}. [In contrast to the commonly cited "Thucydides
Trap" (which predicts a declining world power being replaced by a newly
rising power), the stagnation of alternative powers such as China allows
the current superpower to, by default, retain superior international
influence]{.underline}. Yet, [aversion to the burdens of past decades in
enforcing a "liberal" order will motivate future U.S. governments to
downscale their geopolitical objectives and maintain a more limited
order of international stability]{.underline}.

### AT: EU Soft power

#### E.U. soft power fails\-\--its impacts are exaggerated

Paula **Higgins** 20**23** -- graduate of Ewha Womans University -
Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS) ("EU Soft Power
Illusion," Social Science Research Network, 23 Oct 2023,
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4582269>, /JP)

[THE]{.underline} European Union ([EU]{.underline}) [has frequently
emphasised its soft power capabilities as its primary currency on the
international stage]{.underline}. Many scholars have written about the
reliance of the EU on soft power instruments to influence world affairs
and push forward its policy goals (see Michalski, 2005; Casey, 2006;
Pasternac, 2017; Thompson, 2019) in an analogous way to states. Despite
progress in Common Foreign and Security Policy, (CFSP) framework to give
the EU one voice on the international stage , the notion of a common EU
foreign policy must be heavily qualified. The EU can,
[however]{.underline}, be considered an international actor in the sense
of the impact its policies have on the global and regional environment,
and on relations with other major international actors (Zielonka, 2008:
473--75).

Hill (2010) argues that, as the first of its kind, the EU 'project' has
tried to tailor its foreign policies to expand its soft power potential.
There is a fondness of senior EU officials to speak of its soft power
capabilities - based on promoting its liberal 'European' norms and
values - as the optimal way for the EU to influence its external
environment. The reason for this is two-fold. First is that [the EU
lacks the traditional 'hard power' policy tools that most states have in
the form of substantial armed forces or military
preponderance]{.underline}. Therefore, [in order to achieve what it
wants, the EU needs to rely on nonmilitary and non-coercive
options.]{.underline} The second reason is that the EU has a very
limited cultural identity compared to the individual states in the
Union. These individual states can use their distinct national culture
for soft power goals. The EU, in contrast, must rely on its shared
norms.

The EU constructs its soft power in relation to its values because of
its particular history and its liberal construction (Birchfield, 2013).
The historical narrative of peaceful integration between countries that
used to be enemies is consciously presented by the EU as its main source
of soft power (and for which it became the Nobel Peace Prize recipient
in the 2012). The challenge for the EU has been turning this liberal
rhetoric into concrete and consistent foreign policies (although the
2009 Lisbon Treaty was helpful in setting the EU as a single actor with
a unitary voice for all its Members when it comes to its foreign policy
actions and strategies with other countries).

Since the EU talks of its soft power as a manifestation of its
projection of 'normative power', there is often an incorrect conflation
of these two similar but distinct concepts. First coined by Manners
(2002), 'normative power' refers to the EU bureaucracy's ability to
transform other countries' domestic affairs and inculcate democracy
abroad by disseminating and exporting EU liberal principles and
democratic practices. The international power of the EU is associated
with persuasion and cooperation rather than coercion or unilateralism. A
normative power goes beyond Westphalian conventions, exercising
influence "not by what it says or does, but what it is" (Manners 2002:
252). This line of argument highlights how the EU has uniquely developed
post-national, post-sovereign and even post-modern policies, to employ
its power via shared norms, values and good governance practices
(Michalski, 2005). These fit a more Kantian logic of cooperating world
governance and are adaptable to our more interconnected and complex
world today (Keohane Nye, 2000).

EU policymakers promoting the EU as a soft power giant serves a purpose
by "playing up those aspects of foreign policy that obscure the EU's
weakness in traditional resources, thereby becoming an argument for the
EU's international legitimacy" (Nielsen, 2013: 730).

II\. SOFT POWER DOES NOT INVOLVE CARROTS

The problem with this projection of the EU as a soft power lies in the
fact that many scholars [and EU policymakers ignore the manner of tools
that the EU uses to project its power]{.underline}. Normative power does
not equal soft power and they cannot be considered synonyms. If one
examines Joseph Nye's primary definition, soft power is in fact: "the
ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or
payments. When you can get others to want what you want, you do not have
to spend as much on sticks and carrots to move them in your direction.
Hard power, the ability to coerce, grows out of a country's military and
economic might. Soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's
culture, political ideals and policies. When our policies are seen as
legitimate in the eyes of others, our soft power is enhanced" (Nye,
2004: 256). In other words, Lukes (2005: 95) argues that "hard power
refers to the changing of the incentive structures of actors whose
interests are taken as given and soft power to the shaping of those very
interests". Essentially, hard power involves a situation marked by
conflict of interest, in which one actor coerces or induces the other to
act (or not) in a particular way, by means of economic or military
resources. By contrast, in the case of soft power, an actor gets its way
by way of the attraction of these values, institutions or ideology.
Economic hard power includes sanctions, payments, bribes, aid, and
preferential trade agreements, as well as both negative and positive
conditionality (Nye, 2004: 31).

The EU exerts hard power in the form of economic carrots, promises of
funding, access to the single European market (SEM) and the ultimate
carrot: EU membership. When it makes other countries or firms adopt EU
rules or standards, this conditionality approach is a form of exerting
power (Goldthau Sitter, 2015: 948). As Meunier and Nicolaidis' (2006:
920) argue, '"the EU's trade power is about using mainly 'carrots' and
sometimes 'sticks' to enforce such norms on trading partners". To
reiterate, Ashton (2011) stated that, "the EU has soft power with a hard
edge - more than the power to set a good example and promote our values.
But less than the power to impose its will". One form of power cannot
exist without the other, according to many scholars. In fact, the two
forms of power must always work in a symbiotic relationship, reinforcing
each other (Nye, 2011: 23).

The EU has often relied on its stronger economic position in relation to
its partners, or indeed on the regional hegemony it enjoys over most of
the European continent. The financial inducements and positive
conditionality (what the EU Commission categorise as soft power)
actually are an example of normative power - again, which should not be
mistakenly conflated with soft power - in that "negotiation, contractual
relationships and economic incentives are a central element". But
conditionality, whether positive or negative, and the sanctions implied,
are, on a more rigorous understanding of power, at the lower end of what
can be termed hard power (Nye, 2004: 8).

[If the EU truly had the soft power strength]{.underline} - as defined
by Nye - [that it claims to wield, we would see a high level of
voluntary emulation and imitation by countries around its
neighbourhood.]{.underline} [The EU's soft power would attract these
countries to engage in norm convergence with the EU's values and buy
into EU policies because they agree with them]{.underline}. [We would
see examples of norm socialisation,]{.underline} even in the absence of
any economic incentives. [The world is not that simple]{.underline} and
often hard power considerations determine choices on the international
stage. The present paper will examine the impact of the EU's project to
export liberal values and democracy to its neighbourhood and ask whether
the EU successfully projected its soft power into these participating
countries? Can it change the hearts and minds of the people in the
Eastern countries to internalise EU norms and become socialised to the
EU's way of operating? Can we even say that the EU - as a supranational
institution and not itself a country - possesses soft power at all? The
paper will examine the EU's self-declared "soft power' project in its
Eastern neighbourhood and present alternative approaches to ensure the
successful implementation of EU's (mainly security-based) policy
objectives.

#### EU soft power ineffective, Ukraine war shows

Oleksandr **Moskalenko**, 20**23** an academic researcher focusing on
European politics and is a Non-resident Fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis (CEPA). ("Europe --- Too Soft, Not Enough
Power", CEPA, April 18, 2023,
https://cepa.org/article/europe-too-soft-not-enough-power/ IB

And yet. The [EU]{.underline}'s [soft power utterly failed to prevent
the biggest conflagration in Europe since World War II]{.underline}.
[Its campaign of sweet reason to persuade Vladimir Putin's regime to
change its approach, and to negotiate rather than the fight was equally
unsuccessful.]{.underline} The EU earnestly wanted jaw-jaw, as Winston
Churchill might have said, but got war-war anyway.

[Putin never made a secret of who he was, or about his ideology and
methods of governance]{.underline}. Faced with the frustrating
conundrums of the modern world, [he chooses war when it suits
him]{.underline}. [Invasion, political assassination, and poisoning are
the stock in the trade of his government]{.underline}. He gave Europe a
choice --- continue our economic and trade cooperation, complete with
distasteful domestic policies and domination of countries along my
borderlands, or we return to confrontation.

Back in 1990, after the peaceful revolutions, the EU's eastward
enlargement marked the erasure of dividing lines. The [success of the
democratic transformations in the former authoritarian countries of the
Warsaw Pact was heavily bound up with the EU's application of
conditionality]{.underline}. Obey our rules and you can enter our bloc,
countries were told. Many did, thus giving rise to the EU's
self-perception as a unique non-military international actor.

There were signs even in 2014, [when Russia first invaded Ukraine and
annexed Crimea, that this formula no longer worked.]{.underline} While
Russia was not being offered membership, [the EU offered assurances to
members old and new that it stood for certain core values]{.underline},
like human rights and democratic norms. [These were non-negotiable. And
yet if that was truly the case, it could not continue its economic
engagement with Russia following an open act of military
aggression.]{.underline}

[Nothing of this kind ever happened.]{.underline} Furthermore,
cooperation continued against the background of Russia's bloody war in
Eastern Ukraine[. EU's sanctions were mostly decorative and
marginal]{.underline}, and the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas
pipeline in September 2021 [reaffirmed the fundamental truths of what
the EU really cared about.]{.underline}

It is true that France and Germany led the Minsk I and II agreements of
2014 and 2015. But eight years of talks failed either to re-establish
the territorial integrity of Ukraine or to stop the bloodshed. (And
indeed the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has since said that
the accords had actually bought "precious time" for Ukraine, suggesting
she never believed they would bring peace.) Worse, the [EU's inability
to formulate a means to deal with open Russian aggression gave Putin a
sense of impunity.]{.underline} In other words, it spurred him to
further, all-out aggression in 2022.

#### EU is perceived as ceding to the white supremacist right shows

The [Ukraine crisis shows that the European Union has a problem with
power]{.underline}. While [its hard-power deficit has recently moved to
the centre of attention, its philosophical and political shortcomings
are an even bigger concern.]{.underline} After all, given
Germany's *Zeitenwende *(foreign-policy 'turning point'), Finland's and
Sweden's debates over NATO membership, and the size of European
rearmament spending pledges, [Europe likely will have more military
resources than anyone other than the United States before too long. But
even then, it will have a soft-power problem]{.underline}.

Europe is home to two identity-building projects, both of which are
deeply alienating to the rest of the world. Each was represented in the
second round of the French presidential election, where the
incumbent, [Emmanuel
Macron](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/emmanuel-macron),
defeated the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen to secure a second
term.

Macron framed the campaign as a choice about what kind of civilisation
France -- and Europe -- wants to be. He portrayed his country as the
ultimate embodiment of enlightened civic virtue. For him (and for
Europeans like myself), the European project is an elaborate attempt to
transcend the continent's bloody history of nationalism, imperialism,
and genocide. The EU is meant to forge a new European identity based on
civic principles such as international law (against 'might makes
right'), liberal democracy (against populist majoritarianism), privacy
(against 'surveillance capitalism'), and human rights (against
the [surveillance
state](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/xi-jinping-surveillance-state-by-mark-leonard-2018-02)).

This project implies a new kind of patriotism -- and, insofar as it has
succeeded, it has provoked a counterrevolution from those who believe
that globalisation and European integration threaten their wealth,
culture, and status. Le Pen presents herself as the tribune of this
new-old version of European identity. Describing Macron as a globalist
agent of death who will lead France and Europe to cultural suicide, she
claims to represent the forgotten farmers and workers whose interests
have been sidelined for the benefit of economic elites and refugees.

The structural dynamics of the French electoral system have intensified
the dialectical relationship between these two versions of European
identity, with the traditional contest between the centre left and the
centre right giving way to a showdown between Christian ethnic
nationalism and civic internationalist patriotism. But France is hardly
alone. One finds similar divisions across Europe. Movements to 'take
back control' have mobilised voters against the openness and
internationalism that underpin the new European identity.

[Europe's internal culture war has undermined its soft
power]{.underline}. [The EU would like to think that it is an exponent
of democracy, yet many of the world's largest democracies -- Brazil,
India, Indonesia, and South Africa -- have been reluctant to stand with
it on Ukraine. Europe's warring identities have each contributed to this
lack of global appea]{.underline}l.

[The problem with the European far right is obvious.]{.underline}
Despite her appeals to religion and traditional values, Le Pen's
xenophobia, [Islamophobia, and implicit white supremac]{.underline}y
have alienated a large share of the global population, not least the
world's 1.9 billion Muslims. What is more surprising is that attempts by
internationalists such as Macron to develop a civic identity have
sometimes also reduced Europe's appeal in many parts of the world. His
version of Europe supports gender parity, minority rights, and
environmental action, but it has also been increasingly willing to
subordinate sovereign power to the imperatives of markets and
supranational principles and institutions.

[These new priorities have naturally been met with charges of hypocrisy.
Many European countries that slammed their doors during the 2015 Syrian
refugee crisis are now offering a warm, open-ended welcome to the
blonde, blue-eyed refugees fleeing from Ukraine]{.underline}. And, as
many attendees at this year's Doha Forum noted, the West's commitment to
the principle of sovereignty in Ukraine rings somewhat hollow after
years of Western drones patrolling the skies above Pakistan and
Afghanistan. Weren't these the same countries that changed international
borders in Kosovo, overthrew Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, and invaded
Iraq? Moreover, after r\*ping the planet for centuries, Europe has now
decided to present itself as a champion of climate-change mitigation and
environmental protection.

What is most off-putting is the way that Europeans tend to universalise
their own experience, often assuming that what is right for them is
right for others (closer to home, an EU enlargement model requiring
other countries to adopt an 80,000-page rule book is a case in point).
For various historical reasons, most European societies have embraced a
balance between majoritarian democracy, minority rights, and private
property, and we now take this package of principles as a given. But as
the Arab Spring showed, people elsewhere might opt for the right to vote
without demanding the full package. Those who rebelled against
authoritarian regimes sought to emancipate themselves, not to mimic the
West.

As my ECFR colleague [Ivan
Krastev](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ivan-krastev) and I
have [argued](https://ecfr.eu/special/power-atlas/culture/), the world
seems to be moving from an era of imperialism to one of decolonisation.
In the former, the success of the capitalist economic model and new
communication technologies helped spread Western ideas and values
worldwide; but now, countries and societies increasingly want to
celebrate their own values and culture.

[This paradigm shift has profound implications for everyone, but
especially for Europe. Powers that want to prosper will need to embrace
a 'sovereignty-friendly' idea of soft power. Failing that, we Europeans
will always be accused of using our norms and standards to defend white
privilege. We will remain at odds with the new project of
decolonisation, and thus out of step with much of the international
community.]{.underline}
