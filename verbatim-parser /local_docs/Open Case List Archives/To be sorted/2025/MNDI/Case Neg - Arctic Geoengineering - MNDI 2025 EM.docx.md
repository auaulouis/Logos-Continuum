The loss of Arctic sea ice over the past half century is one of the most
clear and well-known indicators of human-induced climate change (IPCC,
2021; Copernicus, 2024). September sea ice area has nearly halved since
the beginning of the satellite era in 1979 (Fetterer et al., 2017;
Stroeve & Notz, 2018), and during the same period, estimated Arctic sea
ice volume has decreased by over 10,000 km3 (Kwok, 2018).
[Record-breaking summer sea ice minimums]{.underline} in 2007 (Stroeve
et al., 2011) and 2012 (Parkinson & Comiso, 2013; J. Zhang et al., 2013)
[fueled predictions, which with hindsight look overly
alarmist]{.underline}, [that the Arctic would experience its first
ice-free summer before 2020]{.underline} (Maslowski et al., 2012;
Wadhams, 2016). Adding to this, the Arctic has been warming up to four
times faster than the global average (Rantanen et al., 2022). It has
been further proposed that global warming might be accelerating,
culminating in record breaking warmth in recent years (Samset et al.,
2023; Hansen et al., 2025; Merchant et al., 2025). [As Arctic sea ice
cover is strongly tied to global temperatures]{.underline} (Notz &
Stroeve, 2016), [there would be little expectation of a multi-decadal
slowdown in Arctic sea ice loss]{.underline}. [And yet,]{.underline} as
we will show, **[such a slowdown has been occurring in the last two
decades]{.underline}**. Recall that, [over the past century, periods of
increasing]{.underline} anthropogenic [greenhouse]{.underline}
[emissions]{.underline} [without sustained sea ice loss]{.underline} -
the mid-20th century (Walsh et al., 2017) - [have already
occurre]{.underline}d. [From the 1940s to the 1970s Arctic sea **ice
cover expanded**]{.underline} (Gagne et al., 2017), with the largest
increases in the Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara and Barents Seas.
However, anthropogenic forcing in the mid-20th century was very
different compared to the one of the past two decades. Industrial
aerosol emissions from Europe and North America contributed
substantially to the positive multi-decadal trend in Arctic sea ice area
and associated Arctic cooling in the mid-20th century (Fyfe et al.,
2013; Nafaji et al., 2015; Gagne et al., 2017; England et al., 2021);
but these aerosol sources are far smaller today (Szopa et al., 2013;
Lund et al., 2019). However, when anthropogenic aerosols are being
discussed in the context of the recent past, it is with regards to the
phase out of aerosol emissions from ship tracks which have potentially
contributed to enhanced global warming since 2020 (Manshausen et al.,
2022; Yoshioka et al., 2024). In fact, Yoshioka et al. (2024) find that
the simulated warming response to these reduced sulphur emissions is
largest in the Arctic. So, the lessons of the past may not be a reliable
guide for understanding current trends. It is important to appreciate
that the observed trend in Arctic sea ice cover over a given period is
composed of a contribution caused by anthropogenic emissions, denoted
the forced response, and a contribution from unforced fluctuations
associated with internal climate variability (England et al., 2019;
England, 2021; D¨orr et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024).
Anthropogenically-forced changes which may contribute to a reduction in
Arctic sea ice loss over the past two decades include a forced slowdown
in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Lee & Liu, 2023),
and changes in the emissions from biomass burning, both in the magnitude
(Blanchard-Wrigglesworth et al., 2025), and the variability
(DeRepentigny et al., 2022). One would imagine, however, that the
aforementioned reduction of sulphur emission from shiptracks (Yoshioka
et al., 2024) would lead to an acceleration rather than a deceleration
of sea ice loss since 2020. Alternatively [modes of climate variability
which act on multi-decadal timescales]{.underline}, such as the Atlantic
Multidecadal Oscillation (Kerr, 2000; Deser & Phillips, 2021) and the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Mantua & Hare, 2002), [have an important
imprint on Arctic sea ice.]{.underline} For example, [variability
emanating from the Pacific sector]{.underline} (Ding et al., 2018;
Baxter et al., 2019) [or Atlantic sector]{.underline} (Meehl et al.,
2018) [has been suggested to have substantially contributed to the rapid
loss of Arctic sea ice during the 2000s]{.underline} (England et al.,
2019). [A number of recent studies,]{.underline} using different methods
including standard optimal detection method (Shen et al., 2024), machine
learning (Siew et al., 2024) and low-frequency component analysis (D¨orr
et al., 2023), [conclude that internal variability is at least as
important as anthropogenic forcing, perhaps more,]{.underline} for
explaining the steep decline in that period. Needless to say, [internal
variability can damp sea ice loss trends as well as strengthen
them.]{.underline} For instance, Yeager et al. (2015) correctly
predicted a slowdown of winter Atlantic sector sea ice loss for the past
decade based on predictability from oceanic conditions linked to the
North Atlantic Oscillation. In fact, [it has been found in climate model
simulations that internal climate variability **can totally counteract**
the forced loss of Arctic sea ice]{.underline}, **[resulting in periods
of simulated sea ice growth under increasing anthropogenic
emissions.]{.underline}** Kay et al. (2011) were among the first to
demonstrate, in a single climate model, that positive trends in Arctic
sea ice extent on multi-decadal timescales were possible until the
middle of this century. They found, using a limited ensemble size of six
members, that two members exhibited statistically insignificant trends
in September for the period 1979-2005 due to a cancellation between the
forced response and internal climate variability. Motivated by the
as-of-then brief pause in September Arctic sea ice loss for the period
2007-2013, Swart et al. (2015) analyzed the CMIP5 archive and showed
that seven-year pauses occurred frequently in model simulations, and
concluded that such episodes are an expected feature of Arctic sea ice
trajectory, even in a high emissions scenario. This study also
demonstrated that [pauses in sea ice loss on multi-decadal timescales
remain plausible, and relatively frequent, over the coming
century]{.underline} under a medium- or low-emissions scenario. Looking
back from the vantage point of 2025, [the model-based
studies]{.underline} of Kay et al. (2011) and Swart et al. (2015) now
app[ear remarkably prescient with regards to the plausibility of a
sustained slowdown in Arctic sea ice loss.]{.underline}

#### Artic sea has stabilized -- current warming levels are not driving further ice melt

Rising Arctic Temperatures,"

[The loss of sea ice in the Arctic]{.underline} [due to global warming
has long been held up]{.underline} by the mainstream media and climate
activists [as cause for alarm]{.underline}. [The ice would
be]{.underline} completely [gone]{.underline} in summer, they predicted,
[by]{.underline} 2013, then 2016, then [2030]{.underline}. [But the
evidence shows that Arctic ice is not cooperating]{.underline}, and in
fact [its summer extent in 2022]{.underline} [was the same as in
2008]{.underline}. [And this stasis has occurred even as Arctic
temperatures continue to soar]{.underline}. The minimum summer Arctic
ice extent this month was about 67% of its coverage in 1979, which is
when satellite measurements of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic
began. The figure to the left shows satellite-derived images of Arctic
sea ice extent in the summer of 2022 (September 18) and the winter of
2021 (March 7) , which was similar to 2022. Sea ice shrinks during
summer months and expands to its maximum extent during the winter. Over
the interval from 1979 to 2022, Arctic summer ice detached from the
Russian coast, although it still encases northern Greenland as can be
seen. The figure below compares the monthly variation of Arctic ice
extent from its March maximum to the September minimum, for the years
2022 (blue curve) and 2008 (red curve). The 2022 summer minimum is seen
to be almost identical to that in 2008, as was the 2021 minimum, with
the black curve depicting the median extent over the period from 1981 to
2010. ![](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.065693350831146in"
height="2.413479877515311in"} The next figure illustrates the estimated
Arctic ice thickness and volume at the 2022 minimum. The volume depends
on both ice extent and thickness, which varies with location as well as
season. Arctic ice thickness is notoriously difficult to measure, the
best data coming from limited submarine observations.
![](media/image2.png){width="3.181578083989501in"
height="2.6820297462817146in"} The thickest, and oldest, winter ice
currently lies along the northern coasts of the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago and Greenland. According to a trio of Danish research
institutions, just 20% of the Arctic ice pack today consists of thick
ice more than one to two years old, compared to 40% in 1983. Thick,
multi-year ice doesn't melt away in the summer, but much of the ice
cover currently formed during winter consists of thin, first-year ice.
[What is surprising]{.underline}, however, [is that the lack of any
further loss in summer ice extent since 2008 has been accompanied by a
considerable increase in Arctic temperature]{.underline}. The left panel
of the next figure, from a dataset compiled by the European Union's
Copernicus Climate Change Service, shows the mean surface temperature in
the Arctic since 1979. ![](media/image3.png){width="4.955705380577428in"
height="2.1957589676290463in"} You can see that the Arctic has been
warming steadily since at least 1979, when the first satellite
measurements were made. As shown in the figure, the mean temperature
there shot up by 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to
global warming over the same interval of only 0.68 degrees Celsius (1.2
degrees Fahrenheit). That's an Arctic warming rate 4 times faster than
the globe as a whole. [From 2008 to 2022, during which the summer ice
extent remained unchanged on average, the Arctic nevertheless warmed by
about 1.3 degrees Celsius]{.underline} (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit). This
phenomenon of excessive warming at the North Pole is known as Arctic
amplification, depicted numerically in the right panel of the figure
above. The effect shows strong regional variability, with some areas --
such as the Taymyr Peninsula region in Siberia and the sea near Novaya
Zemlya Island -- warming by as much as seven times the global average.
The principal reason for the high amplification ratio in these areas is
exceptionally low winter ice cover, which is most pronounced in the
Barents Sea near Novaya Zemlya. The amplification is a result of
so-called albedo (reflectivity) feedback. Sea ice is covered by a layer
of white snow that reflects around 85% of incoming sunlight back out to
space. As the highly reflective ice melts from global warming, it
exposes more of the darker seawater underneath. The less reflective
seawater absorbs more incoming solar radiation than sea ice, pushing the
temperature higher. This in turn melts more ice and exposes more
seawater, amplifying the warming in a feedback loop. Interestingly,
computer climate models, most of which exaggerate the impact of global
warming, underestimate Arctic warming. The models typically estimate an
average Arctic amplification ratio of about 2.5, much lower than the
average ratio of 4 deduced from actual observations. A recent research
study attributes this difference to possible errors in the modeled
sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing, and in the distribution of
heating from the forcing between the atmosphere, cryosphere and ocean.
They also suggest that [climate models underestimate multi-decadal
internal variability, especially of atmospheric circulation in
mid-latitudes]{.underline} (30o to 60o from the equator), [which
influences temperature variability in the Arctic as well.]{.underline}

#### The risk of ice melt in the Arctic is dramatically overstated -- laundry list of failed ice-free predictions prove

Joakim **Book**, 4/13/**22**, Human Progress, "Is the Arctic Ice about
to Disappear?"
https://humanprogress.org/is-the-arctic-ice-about-to-disappear/, mm

In 2009, the BBC ran a reporting piece on the Arctic featuring the
esteemed polar scientist Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University. The
Catlin Arctic Survey, a project set out to answer vital scientific
questions about sea ice in the Arctic, had just returned with its
findings. Its central purpose had been to gather evidence on how long a
warming planet could sustain an all-year ice cover at its northern pole:
How long did the Arctic ice cover have left? The results, said Wadhams,
who has studied the Arctic since the 1970s, were terrifying. The survey
supported the "new consensus view that the rapid melting of sea ice will
turn this frozen landscape into an open ocean within twenty years" and
that "much of that decrease will be happening within ten years." [The
old view in the scientific literature]{.underline} and publications by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [was
that]{.underline} an extreme event like [an ice-free Arctic could happen
around mid-century]{.underline} at the earliest. Three years later,
Wadhams predicted that an ice-free Arctic would occur in 2015 or 2016,
describing the climate events of these northern latitudes as a "global
disaster." The scientific article that prompted the infamous
disaster-peddling journalist Nafeez Ahmed to run a full Q&A with Wadhams
in The Guardian suggested the Arctic ice would melt "within 30 years,"
but somewhere between scientific publication and newspaper reporting,
the prediction got shifted by an order of magnitude. In 2016, The
Guardian ran another weekend long-form piece with Wadhams as his
fascinating and comprehensive book, A Farewell to Ice: A Report From the
Arctic, was hitting the shelves. Although Wadhams repeats his warnings
of an imminent ice-free Arctic in the book, he is more balanced,
suggesting that [the prediction game of when an ice-free Arctic may or
may not happen takes away from the more important point:]{.underline}
[The dismal failure of most models to reproduce the present state of the
Arctic ice in summer.]{.underline} The debate over exactly when the
September Arctic will become ice-free has distracted attention from the
more important issue, which is how fast, and in what manner, the Arctic
sea ice will retreat at all seasons of the year. [While long term trends
show a decline in Arctic ice,]{.underline} Wadhams' [stark predictions
didn't come true]{.underline}---[in 2016 or in any other year
since]{.underline}. In fact, the September lows of the Arctic sea ice
extent in 2021, per NASA data, was one-sixth above what it was when
Wadhams uttered these fateful words in 2016. The interview had Wadhams
double down on his remarks in response to a direct question about his
previous predictions. He said that the historical trend was clear and
that by 2016 or 2017, the "central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be
able to cross over the north pole by ship." Five years later, that still
wasn't true, according to the maps published by the National Snow and
Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Yet, he's not
alone in making these stark predictions about Arctic ice. In 2007,
Professor Wiesław Masłowski of the Naval Post Graduate School in
Monterey, California, projected that the Arctic would be ice-free by
2013, based on state-of-the-art modeling and 50 years' worth of data. In
an Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences article in 2012,
Masłowski and three coauthors updated this figure to "2016 ±3 years."
Those years came and went, yet still there was no ice-free Arctic. More
recently, Harvard professor James Anderson said in 2018 that the chance
of any permanent ice left in the Arctic by 2022 was "essentially zero."
When the observations come in later this year, we'll find out, but it's
not looking promising for Anderson's prediction. My purpose above is not
to take pot-shots at failed predictions or minimize the threat of
climate change: the future is difficult to predict, and the Earth's
climate system is ridiculously complicated. The danger that these
climate scientists give voice to is real and important; the reality is
just nowhere near as bad as they say. Wadhams' polar research has been
invaluable to what we know about this remote part of the planet: the ice
cover is gradually shrinking, as is the thickness of that ice. As it
shrinks, it reflects less of the sun's incoming rays, exposes the ocean
below it to much more heating, and threatens to release methane plumes
long stored at the ocean floor. However, [even]{.underline} some of [the
brightest scientists get carried away by]{.underline} their own
[research]{.underline} [and overestimate its importance]{.underline}.
When thrust before journalists on the hunt for juicy quotes, it's no
secret that the state of the scientific literature---let alone their own
research findings---might get a bit polished. Exaggerated. While [a more
resilient Arctic is]{.underline} bad for the predictions of Wadhams,
Masłowski, and Anderson, it's actually [good news for a climate area
drenched in pessimism]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} January [2022, sea
ice in the Arctic was **at its largest extent in over a
decade**]{.underline}---but strangely, the NASA press release reported
it under the heading "NASA Finds 2022 Arctic Winter Sea Ice 10th-lowest
on Record." Contrary to what we might learn from casually browsing the
newspaper headlines, [we will likely continue to have ice in the Arctic
for a long time]{.underline}. What failed past predictions by reputable
scientists and institutions tell us is that we don't understand these
complex systems as well as we would like to. That means that the next
prediction, perhaps of an even more dire nature, ought to be taken with
a whole jar of salt. [The world has an unfathomable]{.underline} and
mind-boggling [amount of ice]{.underline}. Something like [one-eighth of
all the Earth's land is covered by i]{.underline}t[---some of
which]{.underline}, like the ice sheets at Greenland and Antarctica[,
are kilometers thick]{.underline}.

### AT Arctic Tipping Points

#### No tipping points for Arctic sea ice -- winter seasons prevents runaway ice melt

**NSIDC**, 12/17/**21**, (National Snow and Ice Data Center), "Does
Arctic sea ice have a tipping point?"
https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/does-arctic-sea-ice-have-tipping-point,
mm

[Scientists once thought that Arctic sea ice could have a tipping
point]{.underline} because the upper ocean layer would retain too much
heat, warming too much for sea ice to form again once melted.
"[This]{.underline}, however, [has not stood up to
modeling]{.underline}," said Ted Scambos from the University of Colorado
Boulder. Though Arctic sea ice has no definitive threshold, it is
showing a rather significant trend in sea ice loss. Since the early
2000s, tipping points have emerged on the Antarctic and Greenland Ice
Sheets, with a major global current known as the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and permafrost thaw. The question then
begged to be asked of Arctic sea ice. [A tipping point in the Arctic
Ocean would mean losing so much ice that its heat-reflecting effects are
severely diminished, leading to more and more ice loss]{.underline}.
With this vicious cycle in place, ice could not recover to its previous
summertime levels. After Arctic sea ice hit a record low in 2007, some
scientists considered the possibility that sea ice has already passed
this tipping point. [A 2011 modeling study]{.underline} from researchers
at the Max Planck Institute in Germany [suggeste]{.underline}d that sea
ice could recover quickly, **[even if all the ice melted in the
summer]{.underline}**---[showing that the feedback effects that would
lead to a downward spiral in ice extent may be weaker than suspected.
The study shed some good news for the Arctic.]{.underline} Researchers
from the study do not argue against the mainstream view that a
seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean is inevitable. The issue is how we get
there---with or without a tipping point. [Another study from 2016 showed
that]{.underline} the decline in the observed sea ice extent correlates
well with the increase in CO2 emissions. It is not a perfect match
because there is variability in the ice extent from year-to-year, but
"[runaway" ice loss is not seen]{.underline}. This agrees with the 2011
modeling study. [The key to Arctic sea ice not having a tipping point is
its winters]{.underline}. [Arctic winters are shrouded in complete
darkness and air temperatures drop below freezing]{.underline}. [This
causes the ocean to lose heat---enough for ice to rapidly form and grow
and survive the next summer\'s melt]{.underline}.

### AT AMOC Collapse -- Won't Happen

#### Low risk of AMOC collapse -- insufficient model support

**MIT Climate Portal,** 11/7/**24**, MIT Climate Portal, \[MIT professor
of oceanography\], "What would happen if the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapses? How likely is it?",
https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-would-happen-if-atlantic-meridional-overturning-circulation-amoc-collapses-how-likely,
mm

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is part of a
"global conveyor belt" of ocean currents, exchanging cool and warm water
in a path around the Atlantic Ocean.1 The surface branch of the AMOC
merges with the famous Gulf Stream, and carries warm water coming all
the way from the Southern Ocean near Antarctica up to the Arctic Sea
near the North Pole. Along this journey, the waters become saltier,
thanks to evaporation in the subtropics and an influx of salty waters
from the Mediterranean Sea. Upon reaching the Arctic, they also get
colder. Cold, salty waters are very dense and plunge to the bottom of
the ocean, leaving the surface waters on the European side of the
Atlantic warm. Eventually, the cold water winds its way back south to
the Southern Ocean, where the westerly winds pull it back to the
surface, and the process begins again. The AMOC doesn't just move water
around; it plays a huge role in transporting heat to different parts of
the world. This means any changes in its circulation also affect weather
and climate conditions up and down the Atlantic.2 And today, [the AMOC
is changing]{.underline}, thanks to warming oceans, increased rainfall,
and melting sea ice. The history of our planet reveals how dramatic
these changes can be. "We know that the AMOC at times, during the ice
ages, has collapsed. We know that the AMOC at other times was weaker,"
says Raffaele Ferrari, a professor of oceanography at MIT. So what is
likely to happen today? [Data around whether the AMOC has]{.underline}
already [weakened]{.underline} in modern times [is]{.underline} a bit
[uncertain]{.underline}, says Ferrari, because we only have direct
measurements going back about a half century. But current information
suggests the circulation may have slowed by as much as 15 percent since
the 1950s.3 [How much more it could slow]{.underline}---or even how
accurate that 15% figure is---[is still debated]{.underline}. But there
is consensus that climate change is likely to further weaken the AMOC.
Warming temperatures heat up the ocean, which makes water lighter, less
dense, and less likely to sink. Meanwhile, increased rainfall and
melting ice will add more freshwater to the ocean, reducing its
salinity. "If there isn\'t enough increase in salinity and decrease in
temperature, this water, instead of sinking down, will essentially veer
to the right and come back at the surface," says Ferrari. That would
reduce the amount of heat released to the atmosphere---a crucial
function of the AMOC, because it plays an important role in keeping
Northern Europe's climate mild, even at latitudes that are frigid in
other parts of the world. As a result, even a slight slowdown in the
AMOC can cool Europe, change precipitation patterns in parts of Europe,
South America, and Africa, affect the timing of the Indian monsoon, and
lead the tropical rain belt to shift southward, resulting in droughts
over the African Sahel.4 We also know that it's possible for the AMOC to
collapse altogether. Around the end of the last ice age, a mass melting
of ice sheets inundated the Northern Atlantic with freshwater. That
changed the density of the water in the northern latitudes, which made
it more difficult for water to sink and cool down before heading south.
The result was massive cooling in the Northern Hemisphere, and warming
in the south, in a matter of just decades.5 Such a collapse would be
what scientists call a "climate tipping point"---an event that would
lead to sudden, wide-reaching impacts that are difficult if not
impossible to reverse. Changing currents would cause sea levels to rise
swiftly in areas like the U.S. East Coast, storms would grow more
severe, the rainy and dry seasons in the Amazon may flip, and the ice
age pattern of a cooling north and warming south would play out once
again.6 Is that in store for us[? A recent study]{.underline}, using a
climate model in a novel way, [projected]{.underline} that
[an]{.underline} [AMOC]{.underline} [collapse]{.underline} could come as
early as mid century, assuming global warming continues at its current
rate.6 **[But that finding is not widely accepted]{.underline}**, says
Ferrari. In his view, [today's pace of climate change doesn't appear
substantial enough to spur a near-term collapse of the]{.underline}
[AMOC]{.underline}. "[The likelihood that the AMOC
collapses]{.underline}, let\'s say, [before the end of the century,
according to numerical models and our understanding, **is pretty
small**]{.underline}. [Most likely the weakening will be
modest]{.underline}," he says.

### AT AMOC Collapse -- No Extinction

#### AMOC collapse isn't existential -- past climate eras prove

Devin **Hartman**, 12/15/**23**, R Street, \[Hartman is director of
Energy and Environmental Policy at the R Street Institute.\],
"Low-Energy Fridays: Climate Change is - and is not - an existential
risk,"
https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/low-energy-fridays-climate-change-is-and-is-not-an-existential-risk/,
mm

The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference is over, but
[undercurrents of existential anxiety persis]{.underline}t. This is a
timely reminder that climate policy begins with characterizing the
problem correctly. Perhaps no frame has been more hotly debated---and
misunderstood---than whether climate change poses an existential risk.
As this week's title reveals, the answer is not definitive. But
understanding the circumstances under which climate change is and is not
an existential risk has profound bearing on whether our policy response
benefits or harms humanity. [An existential risk threatens the
existence]{.underline} [of]{.underline} a subject, such as a community,
a nation state, or even [humanity as a whole]{.underline}. In this
sense, climate change does present such a risk to certain communities or
nation states, such as low-lying island countries susceptible to
sea-level rise. Climate change is, to a degree, a matter of life or
death, considering how it may shift mortality patterns around the world.
But [there is no evidence that humanity's existence is at
stake]{.underline}. However, climate change is existential to an
alarming proportion of Earth's species---with up to half facing
extinction. [We can learn much from the history of the human condition
under previous climate eras]{.underline}. Paleoclimate data reveal that
climatic fluctuations markedly affected human evolution and perhaps
eliminated some human populations up to continental scale a million
years ago. Overall, however, [primitive humans proved resilient under a
variety of harsh climatic conditions]{.underline}. In fact, [the
collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
current]{.underline}---arguably the biggest climate risk in the news
today--- [previously occurred about 14,500 years ago]{.underline}. This
is not to understate the threat that human-caused climate change
presents, but simply to put it in perspective. There are scenarios of
climate "tail events" that could accelerate climatic disruption and
induce massive economic, social and ecological damages. Yet [there is no
scenario in which humanity would not be able to provide the bulk of its
basic needs]{.underline}, [especially with further technological
advances.]{.underline} Distinguishing the circumstances of existential
climate risk is not just semantically important---it is crucial for
better civil society dialogue, policy analysis and decisions.
Importantly, policies to mitigate climate change only improve society if
their benefits exceed their costs.

### AT Methane Scenario -- AT Permafrost Thaw

Permafrost, or soil that remains at or below freezing for at least two
consecutive years, is a significant global carbon store. When it thaws,
stored carbon is released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases,
amplifying climate warming. This process, especially pronounced in
colder ecosystems like High Mountain Asia (HMA), threatens to intensify
global warming further.

HMA, home to over 70% of the world\'s low-latitude mountain permafrost,
faces ongoing warming. Scientists have debated whether HMA will become a
net source of carbon emissions in the future, making precise permafrost
loss estimates increasingly important. [Accurate predictions for
permafrost degradation are therefore crucial.]{.underline}

A new study published in Geophysical Research Letters highlights the
role of \"equilibrium climate sensitivity\" (ECS), a metric estimating
how much global surface temperature increases with rising carbon dioxide
levels. [[Around 40% of]{.mark} the [models used in]{.mark} the most
[recent global climate assessments predict ECS values above]{.mark} the
likely [range of 2.5°C to 4°C.]{.mark} [These inflated values contribute
to **exaggerated regional warming forecasts**]{.mark} for areas like
HMA, which [in turn]{.mark} could **[distort permafrost loss
predictions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[To overcome the bias in existing studies, the research team based in
the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences used a statistical approach to adjust the warming magnitude
associated with ECS according to the best estimate of ECS
value]{.underline} (about 3°C, according to the 6th Assessment Report of
the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change). With these adjustments,
they calculated future warming projections and related permafrost loss
under different emissions scenarios. [Their [findings suggest]{.mark}
that under constrained projections, [permafrost loss estimates]{.mark}
for HMA [in]{.mark} the [coming]{.mark} [decades are **significantly
lower** than previously thought.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Using these improved projections, the researchers found that by
2081-2100, the HMA permafrost area could shrink by 37% to 64% under mid-
and low-emission scenarios, a decrease from earlier
projections.]{.underline} Without the adjustments, [[previous models
**overestimated** permafrost loss by as much as
**10%.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Under the highest emissions scenario,
however, the impact of warming remains severe, with HMA nearly devoid of
permafrost by the end of the century.

Dr. JIANG Jie , the study\'s lead author, emphasized, \"Global efforts
are underway to curb warming to 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100, and
[[recent]{.mark} [emissions policies have made]{.mark} the [likelihood
of high-emission scenarios much lower]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our study
shows that **[[more realistic temperature projections lead to more
accurate permafrost predictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only for
High Mountain Asia but for other vulnerable permafrost areas as well.\"

[The findings underline the importance of using realistic global warming
levels in climate projections, particularly for permafrost thaw and
related carbon emissions.]{.underline} Conditioning these projections
based on the best estimate of climate sensitivity could improve the
accuracy of climate impact predictions globally.

### AT Methane Scenario -- ! Defense - Won't Happen

#### Leading climate scientists have debunked the methane bomb theory -- past Arctic warming disproves the threat

Shani **Cairns**, 7/27/**20**, Scientists' Warning, "Debunked: The
Methane Monster,"
https://scientistswarning.org/2020/07/27/debunked-methane-monster/, mm

[The]{.underline} clathrate gun hypothesis (a.k.a. the
[methane]{.underline} time [bomb theory]{.underline}) [is]{.underline}
the popular name for this often [vaguely]{.underline} used and loosely
[defined]{.underline} (video) subject in the news media. It refers to
the theory that increases in sea temperatures or drops in sea levels can
trigger a strong positive feedback effect on climate: first, warming
causes a sudden release of methane from methane clathrate compounds
buried in seabeds and seabed permafrost; second, because methane itself
is a powerful greenhouse gas, temperatures rise further, and the cycle
repeats. This runaway process, once started, could be as irreversible as
the firing of a gun or the sudden explosion of a bomb going off that
would literally be a shot heard around the world. These theories claim
that if these hydrate sources thaw abruptly all at once due to warming,
unstoppable feedbacks would be set in motion, methane would be released
in enormous quantities immediately raising temperatures, and what
pseudoscience dubs near term human extinction would result. Some claim a
50 gigaton methane bomb could burst from the ocean floor all at once
anytime now. They argue that this would not be survivable by humans and
that we would perish in as little as a few short weeks time. These
researchers point to the theory that Methane Hydrate: Killer Cause of
Earth's Greatest Mass Extinction," which highlights the fact that the
most significant variable in the Permian Mass Extinction event, which
occurred 250 million years ago and annihilated 90 percent of all the
species on the planet, was likely methane hydrate. Debate over the
plausibility of a catastrophic release of methane in coming decades due
to thawing Arctic permafrost escalated after a paper warned that exactly
this scenario could trigger costs equivalent to the annual GDP of the
global economy. The methane bomb scenario got a further boost into the
public eye after being featured in a hotly debated New York magazine
article on climate change, which argued that without sharp cuts in
planet-warming carbon emissions, parts of the Earth "will likely become
close to uninhabitable" by the end of this century. As many climate
scientists, like Paul Beckwith, are fond of saying "what happens in the
Arctic, does not stay in the Arctic." This is an interconnected and
complex system that science is constantly attempting to play catch up
with and with data constantly emerging and reshaping our knowledge of
what we're actually seeing. For example, some have claimed that we are
seeing signs of the beginnings of catastrophe and that phenomena like
giant gas blow out craters they are witnessing are proof enough that
we're already moving temperature harder and faster than ever before.
However, [new data]{.underline} (video) [is]{.underline} now
[emerging]{.underline} that says that this is not unexpected or in any
way new for this area. We simply cannot jump to conclusions on these
matters. [A 2018 published review concluded that the]{.underline}
clathrate gun [hypothesis]{.underline} **[remains
controversial]{.underline}**, but that a better understanding is vital.
Actual [measurements of methane in the atmosphere don't show
any]{.underline} such sudden, accelerating [spike]{.underline}, [and
climate scientists don't believe anything like this]{.underline}
"clathrate gun" [scenario is underway]{.underline}, though they cannot
rule out the possibility. Paul Beckwith asks "will the clathrate gun
fire only blanks" in the following video lecture discussing the USGS
paper on this matter: \[video ommitted\]. According to the Guardian,
"scientists of different persuasions remain fundamentally divided over
whether such extreme and abrupt scenarios are at all plausible. Carolyn
Rupple of [the US Geological Survey]{.underline} (USGS) Gas Hydrates
Project [told]{.underline} NBC News [the scenario is '**nearly
impossible'**]{.underline} [citing laws of thermodynamics]{.underline}.
Ed Dlugokencky, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's ([NOAA]{.underline}), [said there has been
'no detectable change in Arctic methane emissions]{.underline} over the
past two decades.' [NASA']{.underline}s Gavin Schmidt [said that ice
core records]{.underline} [from previously warm Arctic periods show no
indication of such a scenario having ever occurred]{.underline}. Methane
hydrate expert Professor David Archer reiterated that the mechanisms for
release operate on time scales of centuries and longer. These arguments
were finally distilled in a lengthy, seemingly compelling essay posted
on Skeptical Science, concluding with utter finality: "[There is no
evidence that methane will run out of control and initiate any sudden,
catastrophic effects.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the Arctic is a region
that is quite dynamic and is changing rapidly. The high latitudes are
currently a CO2 sink and CH4 source in the modern atmosphere, and it's
not implausible that the effectiveness of the sink could diminish (or
reverse) or that the methane source could enhance in the future, since
we expect a transition to a warmer, wetter climate with an extended
thawing season." -- Skeptical Science

### AT Disease -- No Arctic Outbreaks

#### No outbreak from Arctic microbes -- degraded DNA eliminates the risk

Valerie **Brown**, 11/25/**24**, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,

Recently [there's been]{.underline} a lot of press [coverage of "zombie
viruses" bursting out of thawing permafrost]{.underline}. The bodies of
people and animals buried in permafrost a few centuries ago have
contained potentially infectious variants of smallpox, anthrax, and
influenza, but because of this risk, most scientists have expressed
little interest in studying zombie viruses---especially smallpox---in a
lab. [There is little agreement among experts as to the risks of
"zombie" pathogens spreading into the larger world
population]{.underline}. Some research establishes that even very old
permafrost microbes can be viable. But Paul Hunter, a professor of
medicine at the University of East Anglia who has studied Covid and
infectious diseases related to extreme weather, is not worried about the
[viruses]{.underline} that have actually been [revived from
permafrost]{.underline} because "no[ne of them are human pathogens,
they're all protozoan viruse]{.underline}s." Further, Hunter says,
[because]{.underline} all [the "zombie viruses" that are human pathogens
are familiar, if they are revived they can be handled with vaccines and
antibiotics]{.underline}. ["Currently there's nothing to suggest there
would be something coming out that would be a new disease that would
infect humans]{.underline}," he adds. [Much of the viral DNA found in
permafrost is degraded, so even if the viruses remain intact, they are
unlikely to be infectious]{.underline}.

### AT Disease -- ! Defense -- No Extinction

#### No possibility of disease caused extinction.

But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. [With each outbreak]{.underline} of a
headline-grabbing emerging infectious disease [comes]{.underline} a
[fear of]{.underline} [extinction]{.underline} itself. The fear
envisions a large proportion of humans succumbing to infection, leaving
no survivors or so few that the species can't be sustained.

[I'm]{.underline} [not afraid]{.underline} [of this]{.underline}
[apocalyptic scenario]{.underline}, but I do understand the impulse.
Worry about the end is a quintessentially human trait. Thankfully, so is
our resilience.

[For most of]{.underline} mankind's [history]{.underline}, [infectious
diseases were the existential threat]{.underline} to humanity---and for
good reason. They were quite successful at killing people: The 6th
century's Plague of Justinian knocked out an estimated 17 percent of the
world's population; the 14th century Black Death decimated a third of
Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5 percent of the world;
malaria is estimated to have killed half of all humans who have ever
lived.

[Any yet]{.underline}, of course, [humanity]{.underline} [continued to
flourish]{.underline}. Our species' [recent explosion in lifespan
is]{.underline} almost exclusively the [result of]{.underline} the
[control]{.underline} [of infectious]{.underline} [diseases]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} [sanitation,]{.underline} [vaccination,
and]{.underline} [antimicrobial]{.underline} [therapies]{.underline}.
Only in the modern era, in which many infectious [diseases have
been]{.underline} [tamed]{.underline} in the industrial world, do people
have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the
8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and
friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles,
and the like. o what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity
now?

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction, there's no reason to expect
alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any time soon, and my
analysis suggests that **[any real-life domestic microbe
reaching]{.underline}** an **[extinction level of threat]{.underline}**
probably **is just as unlikely.**

Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special
combination of two attributes. First, it would have to be so unfamiliar
that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it. Second, it
would need to have a high and surreptitious transmissibility before
symptoms occur. The first is essential because any microbe from a known
class of pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could
serve as models for containment and countermeasures. The second would
allow the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even
the most astute clinicians.

The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level threats in the world today---influenza, HIV, and
Ebola---don't meet these two requirements. Influenza, for instance,
despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its
contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from
our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known unknown." While there
are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the
time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the
modern era, a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists,
with effective vaccine strategies and antiviral therapies.

HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is
similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, HIV's
dependency on blood and body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola)
requires intimate human-to-human contact, which limits contagion. Highly
potent antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the
disease, and a substantial group of the population has genetic mutations
that render them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly,
simple prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug
users and barrier contraceptives---when available---can curtail
transmission risk.

[Ebola]{.underline}, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as
several others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to
the fact that it [spreads]{.underline} almost exclusively [through
people with]{.underline} [easily recognizable symptoms]{.underline},
plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by
simple supportive care.

Beyond those three, every other known [disease falls short]{.underline}
[of what seems required to wipe out humans]{.underline}---which is, of
course, why we're still here. And it's not that diseases are
ineffective. On the contrary, diseases' failure to knock us out is a
testament to just how resilient [humans]{.underline} are. [Part of our
evolutionary heritage is]{.underline} [our immune system,]{.underline}
[one of the most complex]{.underline} [on the planet,]{.underline} [even
without]{.underline} [the benefit of]{.underline} [vaccines]{.underline}
[or the helping hand of antimicrobial drugs]{.underline}. This system,
when viewed at a species level, [can adapt to]{.underline} almost [any
enemy]{.underline} imaginable. [Coupled to]{.underline} [genetic
variations]{.underline} [amongst humans]{.underline}---which open up the
possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection
to a tendency for mild symptoms---this [adaptability]{.underline}
[ensures]{.underline} that almost [any]{.underline} infectious
[disease]{.underline} onslaught [will leave a large
proportion]{.underline} of the population [alive]{.underline} [to
rebuild]{.underline}, in contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions.

### AT Warming -- Slow/Gradual

#### Climate models have consistently overstated the rate at which climate change has occurred

Research Scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2001,

Average warming of the climate system over the past five decades has
been widely attributed to greenhouse gas emissions---primarily carbon
dioxide (CO~2~)---from the burning of fossil fuels. This belief has led
to calls for greatly reducing humanity's reliance on such fuels and a
transition to "renewable" energy sources such as wind power and solar
energy.

For the purposes of guiding public policy and for adaptation to any
climate change that occurs, it is necessary to understand the claims of
global warming science as promoted by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).1

[[When it comes to increases in global average temperature since the

    emissions]{.mark}, as is usually claimed?]{.underline}

    what [computer]{.mark} climate [models]{.mark}---[used to guide

3.  [[Has the observed]{.mark} rate of [warming]{.mark} been [sufficient
    to justify alarm and extensive regulation]{.mark} of CO2
    emissions?]{.underline}

[While the climate system has warmed somewhat over the past five
decades, [the]{.mark} popular [perception of a "climate crisis"
and]{.mark} resulting [calls for]{.mark} economically [significant
regulation of]{.mark} CO2 [emissions is not supported by
science]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**What Causes Temperature Change?**

Before addressing how much warming has been observed, it is useful to
explain what causes the temperature of anything---the climate system,
the human body, a pot of water on the stove, a car's engine---to change.
The underlying concepts are not difficult to grasp and are experienced
by people on a daily basis.

**Temperature Change Is Caused by an Imbalance Between Energy Gain and
Energy Loss.** One may picture an uncovered pot of water on a stove
being heated over a very low flame. The water will warm rather rapidly
when the stove is first turned on, then it will warm more slowly as the
warm pot loses energy to its cooler surroundings. At some point, the
water will stop warming altogether as the hot water loses energy to its
surroundings just as fast as the flame puts energy into the pot. This
state is called "energy balance" and it corresponds to a stable,
constant temperature.2

D. B. R. Kenning, "Heat Balance," AccessScience, last reviewed August
2020, https://www.accessscience.com/content/article/a310400 (accessed
January 3, 2024).

Or one may imagine wearing a coat outside in the winter. People wear
coats to reduce the rate of energy loss by their bodies. If people did
not wear coats, their bodies would lose energy faster than they could
generate heat through metabolism, and people would go into hypothermia.
The coat helps to maintain energy balance by reducing the rate of energy
loss by people's bodies.

As a final example, everyone has experienced how air temperature changes
on a sunny day. The air warms through the morning and early afternoon.
But by late afternoon, something curious happens: The temperature starts
going down, even though the sun is still shining. This cooling happens
because the rate of energy loss by the air becomes greater than the rate
of energy gain from sunlight as the sun sinks lower in the sky.

In all of these examples, when energy gain equals energy loss, there is
no temperature change. If there is an imbalance between rates of energy
gain and energy loss, the temperature changes.

**Recent Warming of the Climate System Corresponds to a Tiny Energy
Imbalance**

The average rate of energy gain by the global climate system from
sunlight is variously estimated to be 235 to 245 Watts per square meter
(W/m^2^),3

Kevin E. Trenberth, John T. Fasullo, and Jeffrey Kiehl, "Earth's Global
Energy Budget," Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Vol.
90, No. 3 (2009), pp. 311--324,
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/90/3/2008bams2634_1.xml
(accessed January 3, 2024).

so, for purposes of discussion the assumption is 240 W/m^2^. For global
temperatures to remain approximately constant over time, the rate of
energy loss by the system to outer space, which occurs through infrared
(IR) "heat" radiation, must also be approximately 240 W/m^2^.

But just how well do climate researchers know these numbers, and what is
the evidence that there is a natural balance between them? The best
satellite measurements from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's (NASA's) Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System's
(CERES's) instruments are only accurate to a few W/m^2^ (about 1 percent
of the average energy flows4

). [[To estimate the level of global energy imbalance, researchers
use]{.mark} long-term [measurements of the]{.mark} gradual [warming of
the global average oceans]{.mark} to estimate the energy imbalance.
[From the]{.mark} observed [rates of warming]{.mark} of the deep ocean
[it is straightforward to compute that the current energy imbalance is
only]{.mark} about 0.6 W/m2,]{.underline}[5]{.underline}

[which is [a]{.mark} tiny [fraction of the approximate]{.mark} 240 W/m2
[natural energy flows]{.mark}. [This imbalance is]{.mark} thus
[considerably smaller (by]{.mark} about [a factor of four) than the
accuracy with which one can measure]{.mark} global average rates of
energy gain and loss in and out of [the climate system using
satellites.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This is important because]{.mark} it means that [some portion of
recent warming could be natural]{.mark}. But since climate researchers
do not understand natural sources of climate change, such as those that
caused the Roman Warm Period of about 2,000 years ago, the Medieval Warm
Period of about 1,000 years ago, and the Little Ice Age several
centuries ago, most climate researchers simply assume that a similar
event is not happening today.]{.underline}[6]{.underline}

and Their Implications," Geology, Vol. 26, No. 5 (1998), pp. 471--473,

(accessed January 3, 2024).

[Instead of admitting that natural processes could be at work in causing
climate change, "energy equilibrium" is what is assumed by the
mainstream climate research community for the natural state of climate
system unaffected by humans. The members of this community assume that
the rate of energy input into the climate system from the sun is, on
average, exactly equal to the rate of energy loss to outer space from IR
radiation when averaged globally and over many years.]{.underline} The
current, small roughly 0.6 W/m^2^ imbalance in the approximate 240
W/m^2^ energy flows in and out of the climate system is then entirely
blamed on the burning of fossil fuels.

But this energy balance assumption for the Earth is a statement of
faith, not science. As mentioned, a natural state of global energy
balance cannot be demonstrated. Even using NASA's best satellite
measurements of energy flows through the climate system.

**Climate Models Assume Energy Balance, but Have Difficulty Achieving
It**

The projections of climate change in the news, and that form the basis
of government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, come from
computerized climate models run by climate research centers in various
countries.7

Veronika Eyring et al., "Overview of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Experimental Design and Organization,"
Geoscientific Model Development, Vol. 9 (2016), pp. 1937--1958,
https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/1937/2016/ (accessed January 3,
2023).

[[These projections]{.mark} are similar to weather forecast models but
[have]{.mark} additional [enhancements that are not needed]{.mark} in
short-term weather forecasts. The models are adjusted to produce no
long-term climate change. In other words, [the models assume that all
climate change is unnatural, and then are used as "proof" of
human-caused climate change when extra CO2 is added to them. Of course,
this is circular reasoning]{.mark}. [There are also numerous]{.mark}
potentially [natural]{.mark}, or non-CO2-related, [reasons a climate may
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The large number of climate models produce global warming rates which
vary by about a factor of three between them (1.8°C to 5.6°C)8

Gerald A. Meehl et al., "Context for Interpreting Equilibrium Climate
Sensitivity and Transient Climate Response from the CMIP6 Earth System
Models," Science, Vol. 6 (2020),
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba1981 (accessed January 3,
2024).

in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO~2~ (2 x CO~2~). In 2023,
Earth's atmosphere was about 50 percent of the way to 2 x CO~2~.
Amazingly, this factor-of-three range of warming projections has not
changed in the more than 30 years of climate-model improvements. This
proves that climate-model forecasts are not, as is often claimed, based
on proven physics. If they were, they would all produce about the same
amount of warming.

As described above, temperature change is the result of energy
imbalance, and all climate models have been tuned to produce energy
balance in the absence of human-produced CO~2~-equivalent emissions.9

Frédéric Hourdin et al., "The Art and Science of Climate Model Tuning,"
Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Vol. 98, No. 3 (2017),
pp. 589--602,
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/98/3/bams-d-15-00135.1.xml
(accessed January 3, 2023).

Without such tuning adjustments (one might call them "fudge factors,"
some of which are *ad hoc*), almost all models' temperature would slowly
drift over time---that is, become progressively warmer or cooler.
Despite this tuning, many models have been found to still have problems
conserving energy.10

Damien Irving et al., "A Mass and Energy Conservation Analysis of Drift
in the CMIP6 Ensemble," Journal of Climate, Vol. 34 (2021), pp.
3157--3170,
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/8/JCLI-D-20-0281.1.xml
(accessed January 3, 2023).

Energy conservation (probably the most fundamental law in science, the
First Law of Thermodynamics) should be a necessary requirement of any
model used for energy policy decisions. The need for model tuning is
unavoidable because the fundamental physical processes in the climate
system (especially cloud characteristics) are not known accurately
enough to build a stable model from physical first principles alone. So,
empirical adjustments must be made to those modeled processes so that
the model will not spuriously warm or cool over centuries of model run
time. Yet, even at this, many models fail.

The assumption that the climate system is in a natural state of energy
balance also means that the models do not include any sources of
long-term natural climate change. Again, this assumption is rather
unavoidable since models can only include processes that climate
researchers understand and can quantify, and that knowledge does not
currently exist for natural sources of long-term climate change. While
scientists often assume that long-term changes must come from some
external forcing agent (such as increasing CO~2~ or a change in solar
activity), the Earth's climate is known to be a "nonlinear dynamical
system," exhibiting chaotic fluctuations, such that long-term changes
are possible without any external forcing.11

Dynamical System,"

For example, small-scale turbulence in the oceans has been shown to be
capable of producing substantial chaotic changes in ocean heat
content,12

a result that invariably is blamed on humanity's greenhouse gas
emissions.

As a result of the assumptions inherent in climate models, any claims

example, warming caused by any process will be more rapid over land than
over oceans.13

While it is true that, based on theory, increasing CO~2~ levels in the
atmosphere should cause some warming, absent any other mitigating effect
from the presence of that CO~2~, just how much warming remains
uncertain. It is entirely possible that much of the warming that has
been observed (although over-predicted by the computer models) may
indeed be due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. After all,
greenhouse gasses, such as water vapor and CO~2~, absorb and emit IR
radiation,14

which is all that is needed for there to be an atmospheric greenhouse
effect (mostly due to water vapor) which keeps the Earth habitably warm
and helps to sustain life. But just how much warming will result from
humanity's role in all this remains considerably more uncertain than is
generally realized.

**[[The Direct Warming from a Doubling of CO2 Is Only
1.2°C]{.underline}]{.mark}**

How much warming does global warming theory say should occur from human
greenhouse gas emissions? The public has been led to believe that models
are fairly accurate in this regard, but the data show different results.
Global warming theory indicates that a doubling of atmospheric CO~2~
would cause only 1.2°C of direct warming if there are no other changes
in the climate system than temperature.15

It is those other, indirect changes (called feedbacks) built into these
models that greatly amplify the rather benign 1.2°C of warming in almost
all climate models. These feedbacks lead to the wide range of current
model projections of 1.8°C to 5.6°C of warming in response to 2 x CO~2~.

warming, not on actual observations of the climate system which reveal
unremarkable changes over the past century or more.

**Climate Models Produce Too Much Warming**

[[Climate models]{.mark} are [not only used to predict]{.mark} future
[changes]{.mark} (forecasting), [but also]{.mark} to [explain past
changes]{.mark} (hindcasting). Depending on where temperatures are
measured (at the Earth's surface, in the deep atmosphere, or in the deep
ocean), [it is]{.mark} generally [true]{.mark} that climate [models have
a history of producing more warming than has been observed]{.mark} in
recent decades.]{.underline}[17]{.underline}

Global Warming," May 4, 2022,

(accessed January 3, 2024).

This disparity is not true of all the models, as two models (both
Russian) produce warming rates close to what has been observed, but
those models are not the ones used to promote the climate crisis
narrative. Instead, those producing the greatest amount of climate
change usually make their way into, for example, the U.S. National
Climate Assessment,18

the congressionally mandated evaluation of what global climate models
project for climate in the United States.

The best demonstration of the tendency of climate models to overpredict
warming is a direct comparison between models and observations for
global average surface air temperature, shown in Chart 1.

In this plot, the average of five different observation-based datasets
(blue) are compared to the average of 36 climate models taking part in
the sixth IPCC Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The models
have produced, on average, 43 percent faster warming than has been
observed from 1979 to 2022. This is the period of the most rapid
increase in global temperatures and anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions, and also corresponds to the period for which satellite
observations exist (described below). This discrepancy between models
and observations is seldom mentioned despite that fact that it is,
roughly speaking, the average of the models (or even the most extreme
models) that is used to promote policy changes in the U.S. and abroad.

**Summertime Warming in the United States**

While global averages produce the most robust indicator of "global"
warming, regional effects are often of more concern to national and
regional governments and their citizens. For example, in the United
States large increases in summertime heat could affect human health and
agricultural crop productivity. But as Chart 2 shows, surface air
temperatures during the growing season (June, July, and August) over the
12-state Corn Belt for the past 50 years reveal a large discrepancy
between climate models and observations, with all 36 models producing
warming rates well above what has been observed and the most extreme
model producing seven times too much warming.

never mentioned when climate researchers promote climate models for
energy policy decision-making. Instead, they exploit exaggerated model
forecasts of climate change to concoct exaggerated claims of a climate
crisis.**Global Warming of the Lower Atmosphere**While near-surface air
temperatures are clearly important to human activity, the warming
experienced over the low atmosphere (approximately the lowest 10
kilometers of the "troposphere," where the Earth's weather occurs) is
also of interest, especially given the satellite observations of this
layer extending back to 1979.22Roy W. Spencer, John R. Christy, and
William D. Braswell, "UAH Version 6 Global Satellite Temperature

warm in three radiosonde (weather balloon) datasets (green), three
global reanalysis datasets (which use satellites, weather balloons, and
aircraft data; black), and three satellite datasets (blue).]{.underline}

As seen with the surface air temperature data in Chart 1, the climate
models on average produced too much warming in the lower atmosphere
since 1979: by 43 percent compared to weather balloons, by 55 percent
compared to reanalysis datasets, and by 75 percent compared to satellite
datasets.

So, it is clear that the latest state-of-the-art climate models produce
too much warming compared to the observations. Yet, those models are
used to guide policy in the U.S. and in other countries. This
discrepancy is not widely appreciated by the public because seldom (if
ever) do news media outlets publish stories that do not fit the
narrative that humans are destroying the climate system.

**If Models Warm Too Much, What Do Current Warming Rates Show?**

There is another, simpler way to model energy flows in the climate
system to help answer the question, What do recent rates of global
warming say about future warming? These approaches assume that all the
warming has been due to humans, which is likely not the case.

[The [accumulation of energy in the deep oceans]{.mark} and the observed
rate of warming of the global land and ocean surface [over the past

of these energy flows that focuses on the warming observed on land in
the deep oceans since 1970 (the period of highest-quality temperature
measurements and most rapid warming and rise in atmospheric CO~2~)
produced a similar range of future warming of 1.5°C to 2.2°C in response
to 2 x CO~2~. Again, this assumes that all warming has been due to human
activity.

But, might the Earth's atmosphere surpass 2 x CO~2~ in the future? This
depends on highly uncertain projections of future usage of fossil fuels.
The good news is that nature is quite efficient at removing "excess"
CO~2~ from the atmosphere, and, depending on future rates of fossil fuel
burning, it turns out that the atmosphere might not even reach 2 x
CO~2~.25

Marine Science Research and Oceanography, Vol. 6 (2023), pp. 163--170.

[[Why Do Climate Models Produce Too Much Warming?]{.underline}]{.mark}

The tendency for climate models to produce too much warming has at least
two possible explanations.

First, it could be that the forcing---any imposed global energy
imbalance---of the climate system26

Climate.gov, "Climate Forcing,"
https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/climate-data-primer/predicting-climate/climate-forcing
(accessed January 3, 2024).

has been assumed to be too large. The forcing from increasing CO2 (and
other less-important greenhouse gases) is believed to be reasonably well
understood. What is less well understood is the role of particulate air
pollution, especially sulfate aerosols from coal and petroleum burning,
either as a direct reflector of sunlight or an indirect one through
their influence on clouds.

The second possibility is that [[climate models are too sensitive to
forcing]{.mark}. That is, [for a given imposed energy imbalance
from]{.mark} increasing [CO2]{.mark}, [they produce too much
warming]{.mark}. For example, temperature-dependent changes in clouds
and precipitation (the regulator of Earth's main greenhouse gas, water
vapor) within the [models could be unrealistically amplifying the
relatively benign 1.2°C direct warming effect of 2 x
CO2]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**What Else Besides Humans Could Be Producing Climate Change?**

One claim that is often made is that humans must be causing recent
warming since scientists do not know of any other reason. This argument
is not from knowledge, though, but rather from a lack of knowledge. For
example, it is simply not known what caused the coolness of the Little
Ice Age several centuries ago, or the warmth of the Roman Warm Period
(about 2,000 years ago), or the Medieval Warm Period (about 1,000 years
ago). Similarly, the U.S. Dust Bowl of the 1930s existed before most
CO~2~ emissions occurred and it must have had a largely natural origin.
Yet, if another Dust Bowl occurred today, it would certainly be blamed
on human-caused climate change.

Some researchers have published unorthodox evidence for non-CO~2~
origins of climate change, for example, through changes in the transport
of energy from the tropics to high latitudes27

Javier Vinos, Climate of the Past, Present, and Future: A Scientific
Debate, 2nd ed. (Madrid: Critical Science Press, 2022),

(accessed January 3, 2024).

and the sun's modulation of galactic cosmic rays, which in turn can
affect cloud formation.28

Henrik Svensmark, "Influence of Cosmic Rays on Earth's Climate,"
Physical Review Letters, Vol. 81 (1998), pp. 5027--5030.

Since clouds are the Earth's natural sunshade, reducing global
temperatures below what they would be in the absence of clouds, a solar
effect on climate remains a possibility.

Another possibility is a natural change in the global ocean circulation.
Earth's climate is considered a nonlinear dynamical system, capable of
undergoing changes all by itself in the absence of forcing. Since the
oceans are very cold (near 4°C, averaged over their full depth), any
change in the slow overturning circulation of the global oceans would
cause surface temperatures to change. And it is well known that even if
warming (or cooling) originates entirely over the ocean it will be
magnified over land.29

Gilbert P. Compo and Prashant D. Sardeshmukh, "Oceanic Influences on
Recent Continental Warming," Climate Dynamics, Vol. 32 (2009), pp.
333--342, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-008-0448-9
(accessed January 3, 2024).

This means that one cannot attribute warming to humans just because
warming is larger over land than over the ocean.

**Conclusion**

[[Climate models produce too much warming when compared to observations
over the past fifty years or so]{.mark}, which is the period of most
rapid warming and increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. [The
discrepancy ranges from over 40]{.mark} percent [for]{.mark} global
surface [air temperature]{.mark}, about [50]{.mark} percent [for global
lower atmospheric temperatures]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even [a factor of
two to three for the United States in the summertime]{.mark}. This
discrepancy is never mentioned when those same models are used as the
basis for policy decisions.]{.underline}

Also not mentioned when discussing climate models is their reliance on
the assumption that there are no natural sources of long-term climate
change. The models must be "tuned" to produce no climate change, and
then a human influence is added in the form of a very small, roughly 1
percent change in the global energy balance. While the resulting model
warming is claimed to prove that humans are responsible, clearly this is
circular reasoning. It does not necessarily mean that the claim is
wrong---only that it is based on faith in assumptions about the natural
climate system that cannot be shown to be true from observations.

Finally, possible chaotic internal variations will always lead to
uncertainty in both global warming projections and explanation of past
changes. Given these uncertainties, policymakers should proceed
cautiously and not allow themselves to be influenced by exaggerated
claims based on demonstrably faulty climate models.

Security published [the first Global Catastrophic Risk
Assessment]{.underline} two weeks ago, and [reached some important ---
and one surprising --- conclusions]{.underline}.1

The legislation provided key definitions:

The term ''[existential]{.underline} [risk'']{.underline}
[means]{.underline} the [potential for an outcome that would result in
human extinction]{.underline}.

The term ''global catastrophic risk'' means the risk of events or
incidents consequential enough to significantly harm or set back human
civilization

at the global scale.

The term ''global catastrophic and existential threats'' means threats
that with varying likelihood may produce consequences severe enough to
result in systemic failure or destruction of critical infrastructure or
significant harm to human civilization.

Congress requested that the assessment focus on six areas of risk:2

the use and development of artificial intelligence (AI);

asteroid and comet impacts;

sudden and severe changes to Earth's climate;

nuclear war;

severe pandemics, whether resulting from naturally occurring events or
from synthetic biology;

supervolcanoes;

Using the key definitions across these six categories, the table below
summarizes my reading of the report.

Below is the full summary table from the report, within which, each
chapter goes into extensive detail on each of the six risk categories.

[The report is well done, and each of the six risk areas are worth their

highlight what the report says about [climate change]{.mark} --- which
the [report does]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [identify as]{.mark} an
[existential]{.mark} risk.]{.underline}

[The assessment recognizes that [changes]{.mark} in climate

["An important dynamic of climate change effects is that [any one

[global]{.mark} catastrophe or an [existential

[The report acknowledges diplomatically that [activists]{.mark} often
[characterize]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} change [as]{.mark} an

"A [strong, international activist movement now exists that engages in

population (330 million), percent would mean approximately 80 million
people, or 2 billion for the estimated global population in 2022 of 8
billion. . . Mortality of this magnitude would effectively be ten times
that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. These values suggest a very high
bar for catastrophic risk. . . **[[No published

Last night I had the chance to give a talk to a wonderful group of
thoughtful and informed normal folks in downtown Denver. After the event
a women came up to me and asked if I was afraid of climate change. I
responded that I was not, for the simple reason that despite the very
real risks of changes in climate, we are focused on those risks. I told
her that I worry much more about the things that we are not paying
attention to, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic arose following a long
period where there was little attention or concern about pandemics among
most scientists or policy makers.

In a paper I wrote almost a decade ago, I warned that the catastrophes
of the 21st century may --- like COVID-19 --- come from places not at
the center of our attention:

I suggest three types of catastrophes lie ahead. The familiar -- hazards
that we have come to expect based on experience and knowledge, such as
earthquakes and typhoons. The emergent -- hazards that are the product
of a complex, interconnected world, such as financial meltdowns, supply
chain disruption and epidemics. The extraordinary \-- hazards that may
or may not be foreseen or foreseeable, but for which we are wholly
unprepared, such as an asteroid impact, massive solar storm, or even
fantastic scenarios found only in fiction, such as the consequences of
contact with alien life. I will argue that our collective attention and
expertise is, perhaps understandably, disproportionately focused on the
familiar. The consequence, however, is a sort of intellectual myopia. We
know more than we think about the familiar and less than we should about
the emergent and the extraordinary. Yet our ability to deal with the
hazards of the future likely depends much more on our ability to prepare
for the emergent and the extraordinary.

The [first Global Catastrophic Risk assessment by the U.S. government is
an excellent starting point for a continuing discussion about
catastrophic risks]{.underline} and how we might better prepare for
them. It tells us that [where our focus lies may not be where we find
the greatest risks]{.underline}.

[[as seen in]{.underline}]{.mark} (most of) them "[[hindcasting"

sub-titled, "Stop using the worst-case scenario for climate warming as

[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} [and advocates]{.underline} [[have

forecasts of this kind]{.underline} [[for decades]{.underline}]{.mark}

but never a retrospective holding to account.]{.underline} [Rather, on

forecasts get the attention, the clicks, the research funding. We saw
the exaggeration mechanism spelled out by Richard Betts of the BBC,
Holman Jenkins of the Wall St Journal, and climate scientist Judith
Curry. The built-in exaggeration of the costs of climate change blunts
the parallel with nuclear power plants. We know with high certainty the
costs of nuclear explosions. We know the costs of global temperature
going above 1.5 C above "pre-industrial" much less certainly, and we can
see the mechanisms by which the likely costs are being systematically
exaggerated. On the other hand, there is abundant evidence that even
without the doomsday exaggerations the plausible risks of climate change
could be very serious, in particular because of the inherent political
economy difficulty of getting needed global or regional cooperation when
political action is mostly at the level of sovereign nation states (see
the G20). Coal power generation is the single biggest source of GHG
emissions, and emissions from coal consumption will probably not fall
fast, whatever the promises. First, coal is cheap, accessible and
generates reliable power for many developing countries; in Asia, coal
alone generates 40 percent of energy consumption, much higher than the
world average of 29 percent. (12) Second, developing countries,
including China, assert a strong claim on carbon space to power their
economic development. They see it partly as a matter of fundamental
justice, since developed countries emitted most of the CO2 that is
already in the atmosphere and seas as the necessary condition for them
becoming developed. Developed countries promise finance and technical
assistance on a massive scale to accelerate the energy transition in
developing countries -- and have a long track record of leaving promises
as promises. (See the global distribution of Covid vaccines. See the
results of vaunted "voting reform" in the World Bank, leaving the US
with 17% and China with 6%.) What is more, the Japanese government plans
up to 22 new coal power plants, as it closes nuclear plants in the wake
of Fukushima. Then comes a question: does drawing attention to the
doomsday exaggerations of the CCC -- "disaster", "catastrophe",
"extinction", "fiddling while the planet burns" - serve to reduce the
political and public pressures for necessary ameliorative action, in a
world where powerful fossil lobbies seek to block or delay such action
for reasons independent of "evidence"? Should "Third Way" essays like
this one not be published, because "give them (deniers, sceptics) an
inch and they will take a mile"? To what extent must mass publics be
"panicked" in order to induce enough collective political and business
action -- national, international -- to substantially slow the growth of
GHG emissions? If we can sustain emission- and temperature-curbing
action only by holding up the certainty of disaster, catastrophe,
extinction, then better to let the doomsday exaggerations continue as
the necessary condition for that ameliorative action. What is the harm,
when the alternative is ruin for humanity and the biosphere? The danger
is that the repeated wild exaggerations produce a public backlash, a
discrediting, and a strengthening of the many "deniers" who see
"leftists, governments, and the United Nations" as the source of
malevolence in the world. A more accurate accounting of the evidence
would (hopefully) produce a more calibrated and sustained public and
business response. What to do? (13) The IPCC should allocate some 10% of
its budget to a Red Team, dedicated to independent scrutiny of its
evidence and conclusions (especially the Summary for Policymakers). (14)
The IPCC should revise its mandate to require it explicitly to focus on
interactions between natural forces and human actions, as it is now
almost required not to, biassing its assessment of the state of
scientific knowledge towards "man-made global warming" as an almost
separate system. Learned societies should more actively seek to
understand and publicize the reasons for repeated large-scale
discrepancies between "hindcasts" and "forecasts" on the one hand and
actual observations on the other, discrepancies strongly biased towards
"disaster". It is particularly important that the knee-jerk attribution
of extreme weather events to global warming be challenged with reference
to evidence. Judith Curry explained -- quoted earlier \-- why [CCC
advocates have a powerful incentive to attribute cases of extreme
weather to global warming, tout court]{.underline}. She has recently
written, "[Apart from the reduced frequency of the coldest temperatures,
the signal of global warming in the statistics of extreme weather events
remains much smaller than that from natural climate variability, and is
expected to remain so at least until the second half of the 21rst
century]{.underline}." She goes on to amplify a point made earlier about
the limits of the [[climate models]{.underline}]{.mark} used for the
IPCC assessment reports: they [[are driven]{.underline}]{.mark} [mainly
by]{.underline} [[predictions]{.underline}]{.mark} of future GHG
emissions. [[They do not include predictions of
natural]{.underline}]{.mark} climate [[variability]{.underline}]{.mark}
[arising from solar output, volcanic eruptions or evolution of
large-scale multi-decadal ocean circulations.]{.underline} [[They do
a]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[poor job of
simulating]{.underline}]{.mark} regional and
[[decadal-scale]{.underline}]{.mark} climate
[[variability.]{.underline}]{.mark} (15) Participants on both sides have
to learn the art of respecting the principle of free speech while
maintaining the standards of civil discourse. While I have stressed the
CCC's support for urgent and radical changes to the way we live, work
and govern, some CCC champions argue that the world economy could
continue on a largely unchanged growth trajectory provided that we
switch fast from fossil fuels to renewables. Indeed, this switch is
beginning to happen fast, with coal and nuclear energy production unable
to compete without subsidies in areas where natural gas, wind and solar
resources are readily available. But to say that life can continue as
before provided we substitute renewables for fossil fuels obscures the
huge difficulties for many developing countries of getting out of fossil
fuels while growing fast enough to reduce the income gap with developed
countries. We must give high priority to investments in "clean coal"
technologies, such as carbon capture, storage and use, to make the
dirtier coal cleaner in existing and new coal-power plants; and link
coal-power retirement to the coming on-stream of attractive
alternatives. The multilateral development banks have recently or will
soon announce bans on coal power. The G7 leaders meeting in mid 2021
promised to stop using government funds to finance new international
coal power plants by the end of 2021. China's Belt and Road Initiative
should increase its pressure on host countries to cut back on dirty coal
and boost clean coal and renewables. A high and immediate priority is to
build a robust financing and technical assistance mechanism for help
from developed to developing countries. The Paris Agreement instituted a
Mitigation pillar and an Adaptation pillar. Intense debate took place
around the third, Loss and Damage, the name of a mechanism to compensate
for the destruction that Mitigation and Adaptation cannot prevent.
Developed countries by and large have sought to marginalize the Loss and
Damage pillar, as they have long sought to marginalize Special and
Differential Treatment for developing countries in trade and investment
agreements. "Finance is something that really rich countries,
particularly the US, have made sure that there is no progress and not
even discussion on", remarked Harjeet Singh, senior advisor at Climate
Action Network International. (16) My "forecast" is that [[in the
next]{.underline}]{.mark} [two to three]{.underline}
[[decades]{.underline}]{.mark} to midcentury [we will make rapid
progress in scientific knowledge about weather and climate, helped by
longer and more accurate satellite and ocean records and by a new
generation of climate models that operate at one to ten kilometers scale
(as distinct from the current models' 50 kilometer scale).]{.underline}
[[We will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably continue to
[[make]{.underline}]{.mark} rapid [[progress in
decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark} GHG from GDP growth, with a combination
of state direction-setting and private innovation focused on
transformations in energy, transport, buildings, industry and
agriculture, using incentives like research and development subsidies
and tax credits for technology investment, and penalties for
carbon-intensive activities. (17) In transport, this entails
coordination across urban planning decisions, public transport
investment, future of remote working, infrastructures for electric
charging and hydrogen loading. (18) [[Transformations in these systems
are already underway]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the prospect of vast new
green investments, supported and under-written by the state, will
intensify them. These green investments will open productive investment
opportunities previously limited by stagnant wages and rising debt,
which have driven investment into increasingly speculative ventures. If
by two or three decades ahead it looks as though the second half of this
century could well experience globally extreme climate and ocean events,
we will be much more knowledgeable about what to do than we are today.

[Climate change is an issue I care passionately about and have dedicated
a significant portion of my life to addressing. I have been politically
active on the issue for over 20 years and have researched and written
about it for 17 years. Over the last four years, my organization,
Environmental Progress, has worked with some of the world's leading
climate scientists to prevent carbon emissions from rising. So far,
we've helped prevent emissions increasing the equivalent of adding 24
million cars to the road.]{.underline} I also care about getting the
facts and science right and have in recent months corrected inaccurate
and apocalyptic news media coverage of fires in the Amazon and fires in
California, both of which have been improperly presented as resulting
primarily from climate change. Journalists and activists alike have an
obligation to describe environmental problems honestly and accurately,
even if they fear doing so will reduce their news value or salience with
the public. There is good evidence that the catastrophist framing of
climate change is self-defeating because it alienates and polarizes many
people. And exaggerating climate change risks distracting us from other
important issues including ones we might have more near-term control
over. I feel the need to say this up-front because I want the issues I'm
about to raise to be taken seriously and not dismissed by those who
label as "climate deniers" or "climate delayers" anyone who pushes back
against exaggeration. With that out of the way, let's look whether the
science supports what's being said. [First, [no credible scientific body
has]{.mark} ever [said climate change threatens the collapse of
civilization much less the extinction of the human
species]{.mark}.]{.underline} "'Our children are going to die in the
next 10 to 20 years.' What's the scientific basis for these claims?"
BBC's Andrew Neil asked a visibly uncomfortable XR spokesperson last
month. "These claims have been disputed, admittedly," she said. "There
are some scientists who are agreeing and some who are saying it's not
true. But the overall issue is that these deaths are going to happen."
"But most scientists don't agree with this," said Neil. "I looked
through IPCC reports and see no reference to billions of people going to
die, or children in 20 years. How would they die?" "Mass migration
around the world already taking place due to prolonged drought in
countries, particularly in South Asia. There are wildfires in Indonesia,
the Amazon rainforest, Siberia, the Arctic," she said. [But in saying
so, the XR spokesperson had grossly misrepresented the science. "[There
is]{.mark} robust [evidence of disasters displacing people]{.mark}
worldwide," notes IPCC, "but [limited evidence]{.mark} that [climate
change]{.mark} or sea-level rise [is the direct cause]{.mark}" [What
about "mass migration"?]{.mark} "The [majority of]{.mark} resultant
[population movements tend to occur within]{.mark} the borders of
[affected countries]{.mark},\" [says IPCC.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's not
like climate doesn't matter. It's that climate change is outweighed by
other factors. Earlier this year, researchers found that climate "has
affected organized armed conflict within countries. However, other
drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of
the state, are judged to be substantially more influential." Last
January, after climate scientists criticized Rep. Ocasio-Cortez for
saying the world would end in 12 years, her spokesperson said \"We can
quibble about the phraseology, whether it\'s existential or
cataclysmic." [He added, "We\'re seeing lots of \[climate
change-related\] problems that are already impacting lives.\" That last
part may be true, but it's also true that [economic development has made
us less vulnerable]{.mark}, which is why there was a [99.7% decline in
the death toll from natural disasters since its peak]{.mark} in 1931. In
1931, 3.7 million people died from natural disasters. In 2018, just
11,000 did. And that decline occurred over a period when the global
population quadrupled. [What about sea level rise?]{.mark} IPCC
estimates sea level could rise two feet (0.6 meters) by 2100. Does that
sound apocalyptic or even "unmanageable"? Consider that [one-third of
the Netherlands is below sea level]{.mark}, and some areas are seven
meters below sea level. You might object that Netherlands is rich while
Bangladesh is poor. But the [Netherlands adapted to living below sea
level 400 years ago. Technology has improved]{.mark} a bit since then.
[What about claims of crop failure, famine, and mass death? That's
science fiction, not science]{.mark}. Humans today produce [enough food
for 10 billion people, or 25% more than we need]{.mark}, and scientific
bodies predict increases in that share, not declines. The United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forecasts [crop yields
increasing 30% by 2050]{.mark}. And the poorest parts of the world, like
sub-Saharan Africa, are expected to see increases of 80 to 90%. [Nobody
is suggesting climate change won't]{.mark} negatively [impact crop
yields]{.mark}. It could.]{.underline} But such declines should be put
in perspective[. [Wheat yields increased 100 to 300%]{.mark} around the
world [since the 1960s]{.mark}, [while a study]{.mark} of 30 models
[found that yields would decline by 6% for every one degree Celsius
increase in temperature]{.mark}. Rates of [future yield]{.mark} growth
[depend far more on]{.mark} whether [poor nations get access to
tractors,]{.mark} [irrigation, and fertilizer than on climate
change,]{.mark} says FAO. All of this helps explain why [IPCC
anticipates climate change will have a modest impact on economic
growth]{.mark}. By [2100]{.mark}, IPCC projects [the global economy will
be 300 to 500% larger than it is today]{.mark}. Both [IPCC]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [Nobel-winning Yale economist]{.mark}, William
Nordhaus, [predict that warming]{.mark} of 2.5°C and 4°C [would
reduce]{.mark} gross domestic product ([GDP)]{.mark} [by 2% and 5% over
that same period.]{.mark}]{.underline} Does this mean we shouldn't worry
about climate change? Not at all. One of the reasons I work on climate
change is because I worry about the impact it could have on endangered
species. Climate change may threaten one million species globally and
half of all mammals, reptiles, and amphibians in diverse places like the
Albertine Rift in central Africa, home to the endangered mountain
gorilla. [But [it's not]{.mark} the case [that "we're putting our own
survival in danger" through extinctions]{.mark}, as Elizabeth Kolbert
claimed in her book, Sixth Extinction. [As tragic as animal extinctions
are, they do not threaten human civilization]{.mark}. If we want to save
endangered species, we need to do so because we care about wildlife for
spiritual, ethical, or aesthetic reasons, not survival
ones.]{.underline}

Canada's chattering classes claim that climate change is one of the
country's pre-eminent threats. This is extraordinary. Canada is
experiencing a productivity showdown the worst decline in living
standards in 40 years, and growth rates that lag in most developed
countries. Geopolitical threats loom, the healthcare system is under
stress and education is faltering. Yet the federal government has spent
or committed more than \$160 billion on climate initiatives since 2015,
and is funneling \$5.3 billion to help poor countries respond to climate
change. Like most nations, Canada faces tough decisions in coming
decades. Resources spent on climate will not be not available for
health, education, security or boosting prosperity. Global warming is a
problem. Science has shown quite clearly that [[more
CO₂]{.underline}](https://financialpost.com/tag/greenhouse-gases/),
mostly from fossil fuel use, increases global temperatures. Climate
economics has shown how this brings both problems and benefits (for
instance, more deaths caused by heat, fewer by cold) but, overall, more
problems than benefits. More CO₂ means higher social costs, so reducing
CO₂ does have real benefits. [[But climate policies also have
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}. They force families and businesses to use
more expensive energy, which slows economic growth. You might have heard
otherwise but if the new ways really were cheaper, no regulations or
mandates would be needed. [If climate change were treated like any other
political issue, we would openly recognize these trade-offs and try to
balance them to get the most climate benefits for the least cost,
recognizing that climate policies need to compete against many other
worthy policies. First, [people say --- wrongly --- that global warming
is an existential challenge, risking the end of mankind.]{.mark} Of
course, if the world is about to end, it follows that any spending is
justified. After all, if a world-obliterating meteor is hurtling towards
us, we don't ask about the costs of avoiding it.]{.underline} Second, it
is also often claimed --- somewhat contradictorily --- that the [[green
transition]{.underline}](https://financialpost.com/tag/green-transition/)
will make energy cheaper, societies safer and everyone richer. In this
"rainbows and unicorns" scenario, there are no trade-offs and we can
afford climate policy *and* everything else. Both claims
[[are]{.underline}](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2024/05/budget-2024-a-clean-and-safe-environment-for-the-next-generation.html)
[[repeated]{.underline}](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2024/07/09/prime-ministers-remarks-celebration-event-nato-climate-change-and-security)
ad nauseam by Canadian politicians and activists and spread by media
hooked on selling climate catastrophes and green utopias. But both are
quite untrue. That is why I'm writing this series. I will outline how
many of the most sensationalist, scary climate stories are misleading or
wrong and ignore the best climate science. Being data-driven, I will
show you this with the best peer-reviewed data and numbers. So: *Is*
climate change the world's all-encompassing problem today? One way to
test this is to look at [[extreme
weather]{.underline}](https://financialpost.com/tag/extreme-weather/),
which we constantly hear is having an ever-larger impact on our
societies. But the data paint a very different picture (see chart). [We
have good evidence for the number of people killed [in climate-related
disasters,]{.mark} i.e., floods, storms, droughts, and fires. (We'll
look at temperature deaths next week.) [A century ago, such disasters
routinely killed hundreds of thousands, even millions of people in a
single disaster.]{.mark} On average, about half a million people a year
died in such disasters. Since then, [the death toll has]{.mark} declined
precipitously. The last decade saw an average of fewer than 10,000
deaths per year, [a decline of more than 97 per cent.]{.mark} Of course,
over the past century the [world's population has quadrupled, which
means the risk per person has dropped even more, and is now down by more
than 99 per cent]{.mark}. Why this great success story? Because richer,
more resilient societies with better technology and forecasting are much
better able to protect their citizens. That doesn't mean there is no
climate signal at all, but rather that [technology and adaptation
entirely swamp its impact]{.mark}. In the same way, [climate's impact on
overall human welfare is also quite small.]{.mark} In proportion to
the]{.underline} [[total
economy](https://financialpost.com/tag/green-economy/), the [cost of
climate-related disasters has been]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[[declining](https://x.com/BjornLomborg/status/1881623527922536687)
since 1990.]{.mark} Looking to the future, the best estimates of the
total economic impact of climate change come from]{.underline}
[[two]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312030121)
[[major](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523005074)
meta-studies by two of the most respected climate economists. Each shows
that end-of-century GDP, instead of being 350 per cent higher, will only
be 335 per cent higher.]{.underline} "Only" becoming 335 per cent richer
is a problem, to be sure, but not an existential threat. Despite that,
as this series will show, many of the most draconian climate policy
proposals so casually tossed around these days will do little to fix
climate but could dramatically lower future growth and the opportunities
of future generations.

## AT Arctic Conflict Advantage

### AT Arctic Development Race -- Not Happening

#### Arctic development is cost-prohibitive -- no resource race

**WWF 21** "The numbers do not add up for new Arctic oil and gas",
October 15, 2021, WWF,
https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/news/the-numbers-do-not-add-up-for-new-arctic-oil-and-gas/
Gcorb

This past week, we have heard multiple voices about the ever-increasing
bad business of investing in fossil fuels. If we are to limit the global
temperature rise and halt the already devastating effects of climate
change, a complete [global energy system overhaul is required: away from
fossil fuels and towards renewable energy]{.underline}. This is
especially relevant in the Arctic. [Many countries are moving in that
direction by shifting to low-carbon pathways]{.underline} and plotting
out a course towards net zero emissions by 2050. Renewable energy such
as wind and solar are growing rapidly and at a decreasing cost. But the
path to limiting global warming to 1.5°C is a rocky one, as countries
have leaned on fossil fuels in the Covid-19 recovery. **World Energy
Outlook calls for an energy system transformation** [The IEA released
the Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap in May of this year]{.underline},
emphasizing the actions needed by the energy sector to reach net zero
emissions by 2050. The milestones include no investment in new fossil
fuel supply projects, echoing what many scientists and experts have been
saying for years. [The IEA has now gone a step further and brought the
1.5° C global warming scenario onboard their annual World Energy
Outlook]{.underline} (WEO) report released on 13 October. The 2021
Outlook highlights the steps needed to reach the transformational change
of the global energy system. [More [investments in]{.mark} [clean
energy]{.mark} are essential and over the next years]{.underline}, these
[will translate into]{.mark} [[lower prices for oil and gas]{.mark},
[exposing]{.mark} further [its volatility]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
decrease this volatility, governments must be decisive in their policies
and plans, showing leadership in the transition, making it just and
absolute. Investors, concerned over climate risk based on the crisis, do
not like uncertainty. The destructive consequences of the
runaway-train-warming in the Arctic are clear: an obliteration of
ecosystems, wildlife and communities who call the Arctic their home. In
addition to these known environmental concerns, [[drilling for oil and
gas in this]{.mark} vulnerable [region does not make financial
sense]{.mark} either.]{.underline} **The Alaska Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge -- [[drilling will not profit]{.underline}]{.mark}** A WWF
analysis released this past week reverberates this. The Economics of Oil
Development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge report looks at
future oil developments within the Arctic Refuge given the context of
the global economy shift to renewable energy. The Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Northern Alaska is a breeding ground for the
Porcupine Caribou Herd, polar bears as well as important habitat for
more than 200 other species. The productivity and biodiversity of this
region has helped to sustain Gwich'in and Iñupiat communities and their
traditional ways of life. The Refuge has also been the center of a
hard-fought 40-year long debate over oil drilling. Drilling would bring
roads, airstrips, heavy machinery, noise and pollution. This would
damage fragile ecosystems and destroy wildlife habitats, as well as the
impact subsistence activities of local Indigenous communities. [[In the
report]{.mark}, we [look]{.mark} [at]{.mark} three [global oil price
scenarios]{.mark} [to understand]{.mark} the [profitability]{.mark} of
drilling for oil here. In all scenarios, [the analysis concluded]{.mark}
that Arctic Refuge [leases are unlikely to be economic to produce
oil]{.mark},]{.underline} and that [[the United States will not]{.mark},
therefore, [obtain significant revenue from]{.mark} a new
[Arctic]{.mark} Refuge [oil and gas leasing]{.mark}]{.underline}
program. [[By]{.mark} the time oil production starts around
[2040]{.mark}, the [price]{.mark} of oil will most likely be [too low
to]{.mark} make any [profit]{.mark}]{.underline}. But major oil
companies may have already known this, as they were a no-show in the
2021 Arctic Refuge oil drilling lease sale. [[Drilling]{.mark} for oil
in the Arctic Refuge can [also mean]{.mark} further [economic
uncertainty]{.mark}. [Warming]{.mark} temperatures, which in the Arctic
are [almost three times greater]{.mark} than the global average,
[exacerbates permafrost thaw, causing infrastructure
damage]{.mark}]{.underline} on scales we are only beginning to
understand. [[Permafrost thaw]{.mark} is not only happening in Alaska
but [all over the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in Russia,
where infrastructure damage related to permafrost degradation and
subsequent [[infrastructure damage]{.mark} could [cost up to \$100
billion by mid-century.]{.mark}]{.underline} The risks of disruption of
infrastructure and who would be accountable for those are [[making the
economy of Arctic drilling even more dubious]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
findings are timely as lawmakers in Congress consider reversing a tax
bill that opened up for oil drilling lease sales in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. WWF has called on lawmakers to do just that. WWF is
against new exploration and production of oil and gas in the Arctic and
globally. This is now underpinned by the IEA's Outlook, and there are
many other initiatives to stop Arctic drilling for oil and gas -- such
as from the European Union's new Arctic strategy which came out the same
day. Mindful of the trade-offs between financial stability and halting
the climate crisis, governments and financial institutions have been
dragging their feet in transitioning to clean energy. But we are now
finding that continued investments in Arctic oil and gas exploration and
production are not economically viable. As COP26 soon kicks off,
preventing new drilling in the Arctic Refuge would be an important
signal that ambition is increasing to keep global warming within the
1.5° C limit, for the benefit of the Arctic, its people, and our planet.

#### Arctic weather and ice conditions make sailing and shipping near impossible

**Uryupova 24,** a Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute, April 30,
2024, "Climate Change and Challenges of Navigation in the Arctic: How
Safe are We?",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/climate-change-challenges-navigation-arctic-how-safe-are-we/,
Gcorb

[Ship [navigation in the polar regions]{.mark}, i.e. the Arctic and
Antarctica, [requires special qualifications]{.mark} from the
crew]{.underline} and the use of specific technologies. In many ways,
[[going to space is easier]{.mark} [than]{.mark} piloting and [operating
ships in]{.mark} the [polar regions]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are
[[too many uncertain]{.mark} characters and [variabilities]{.mark} which
[make navigation]{.mark} in the polar regions [an adventure
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though people have been bringing ships
to the icy waters and exploring cold regions for centuries, relying
completely on charts and standard navigation tools remains risky, and
the [Polar Code does not provide a one-size-fits-all solution for safe
operations in these areas. Due to climate change, extreme weather
effects are becoming another challenge for ships sailing in the northern
waters]{.underline}. Here we discuss climate and weather factors
impacting navigation in the Arctic. More ships are recorded in the North
over a past decade Due to accelerated rates of melting sea ice in the
Arctic region, the potential for easier and safer navigation seems to be
obvious. For instance, sea ice sickness and variations in interannual
temperature support positive projections of increasing shipping along
the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic region.^1)^ According to the Arctic
Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
(PAME), an increase of 37 percent in ship numbers and distance sailed
has been recorded in the Arctic over the past 10 years.^2)^ At the same
time, it should be mentioned that these numbers do not only represent
ships of the eight Arctic States but also numerous ships under flags of
the Arctic Council Observer States entering the Arctic Polar Code area
on a regular basis.^3)^ Climate change is opening huge, newly ice-free
areas in northern waters for all kinds of activities for civil and navy
vessels. For instance, current growing tensions in the North have
resulted in numerous regional deployments, patrols and other incidents
in the maritime Arctic,^4)^ and brought more icebreakers and submarines
in the region as well.^5)^ Additionally, fishing vessels can be found in
new areas of exploration as soon as commercial species migrate farther
north and fill new niches in local marine ecosystems.^6)^ Marine traffic
of expedition cruise ships has increased significantly in remote Arctic
such as Svalbard and Greenland in recent years as well. Thus in 2022,
the number of passenger vessels was back to the level before the
coronavirus pandemic in some locations.^7)^ Projections for the Arctic
routes indicate 100 percent navigation probability for the coming
decades as well.^8)^ Climate change indicators -- weather and climate
[Recent [data shows]{.mark} that the number of [extreme events and
weather]{.mark} variability [is growing]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline} -- [[these]{.mark} factors can [affect ship
stability and maneuverability]{.mark}, which affects safety at
sea]{.underline}. These abnormalities are [considered as occurrences of
unusual severe weather or climate conditions]{.underline}, which
[[scientists]{.mark} are [not]{.mark} always [able to forecast]{.mark}
accurately]{.underline}. For 2017-2022, temperature extremes, snow and
sea-ice changes, and shifts in seasonality are the most frequently
reported north of 60° N.^9[)]{.underline}^ [In remote areas with a need
to cover large distances, [rough weather,]{.mark} [drifting ice]{.mark}
patches, [and fog]{.mark}gy conditions may [create additional
difficulties]{.mark} for navigation]{.underline} in the Arctic. Such
phenomena as polar lows -- short-lived atmospheric low-pressure systems
-- also known as [extreme marine storms]{.underline}, are being recorded
more often in northern waters. As a result of their activity, strong
winds and rogue waves are created over big areas, posing a threat to
ships.^10)^ Another recently discovered factor related to the climate
change in the Arctic is related to atmospheric rivers -- long and
concentrated water vapors in the atmosphere which significantly reduce
recovery of sea ice and impact navigation in the frigid waters.^11)^
Scientists say that a change of hydrology of the Arctic Ocean is ongoing
as well, thus it may have a significant effect on the distribution of
the marine living resources such as fish, and fishing activity (fishing
vessels) as well, as we record more upwelling areas in the North (areas
where deep and cold waters are brought to the surface of the ocean, and
they create absolutely new conditions for navigation in the area).^12)^
Climate change alters ship's itineraries in the North [About [10 percent
of Arctic waters]{.mark} are [surveyed to]{.mark} modern or [adequate
standards]{.mark}, and appropriate corrections for charts must be
applied according to data sources and alterations originating from
climate change processes.]{.underline}^13)^ When it comes to natural
factors, such as weather and climate, the lack of technology,
insufficient infrastructure and equipment, and human factors may
significantly decrease the safety of navigation across the Arctic.^14)^
[The [frequency of]{.mark} extreme [weather events is growing]{.mark} in
the North]{.underline}. These changes are affecting the Arctic shipping
in many ways, including the increase in risk for navigation. Lower
central pressures for the poleward-shifted storms, which are increasing
in number, may result in increased wind speeds and extreme wave heights
in polar regions, with an associated increase in the sea-spray icing of
ships.^15)^ For example, this was a reason why the fishing vessel Onega
capsized in the Barents Sea in December 2020, after a period of extreme
sea-spray icing conditions.^16)^ [[Out-of-date]{.mark} nautical
[charts]{.mark} may [pose a huge risk]{.mark} for navigation [in shallow
waters]{.mark}]{.underline} and fjords of the Arctic. Concerns should be
raised in the maritime industry over the quality of the data upon which
the charts are based, since the age and accuracy of data on nautical
charts may significantly vary. One of the [reasons for the inaccuracy of
data might be an environmental shift caused by climate change. In fjords
with active melting glaciers]{.underline} -- a meltout sediment from the
basal ice adds sediment to the flow and increases the deposition rate,
and as a result the bottom topography changes significantly over the
years.^17)^ These factors were likely the case when the expedition
cruise ship *The Ocean Explorer* got stuck in the mud in a remote area
of Alpefjord, East Greenland, in 2023.^18)^ Numerous examples show that
the harsh environment of polar regions still may pose a considerable
risk to ship navigation. The Polar Code: Sailing through a plethora of
challenges [The Polar Code,the international code of safety for ships
operating in polar waters]{.underline}, is a relatively recent and
significant milestone in international regulation of navigation in polar
waters,which covers a [wide range of requirements to ships operating in
the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas.^19)^ It has
been created as a compulsory framework for safe ship operation and
environmental protection in icy waters]{.underline}. On one hand, the
Polar Code's provision gives a solid universal set of operating
standards for various vessels sailing in the polar areas. On the other
hand, experts identify multiple notable gaps in the documents,
especially related to the environmental protection, pollution, and
safety of various types of vessels.^20)^ Among other obstacles, issues
related to climate change are not properly covered in the Code at all. A
broad variety of climate-induced environmental impacts includes not only
temperature and sea-ice conditions mentioned in the documents but many
other parameters such as fog, sea-spray icing, atmospheric rivers,
unusual storms, and more. The Polar Code has been improving since the
time it was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in
2014. The most significant modifications are related to pollution of the
Arctic Ocean, such as the prohibition on the use of heavy fuel,^21)^ and
discussions on underwater noise pollution.^22)^ However, it is difficult
to find any advice on the prediction and mitigation of hazardous weather
events caused by climate change on ships operating in polar regions. Icy
waters remain highly unpredictable for various types of ships, even the
best prepared and equipped, as recent incidents demonstrate. As a
result, significant efforts should be made to research, develop and
improve life-saving equipment and communication technology aboard the
vessels operating in the polar waters.^23)^ The need for independent
maritime regulatory authorities as well as the development of state
transport policies, and wider information-sharing relating to the
analysis of the impact of climate change should be taken into
account.^24)^ Conclusion [The [polar regions]{.mark} can [still]{.mark}
be considered among the [most challenging environments to
navigate]{.mark} by sea]{.underline} [[due to]{.mark} risks presented by
[unpredictable weather]{.mark} [and climate]{.mark}
factors]{.underline}. The number of ships sailing in Arctic waters is
increasing and will continue to grow over coming decades, which will
produce both opportunities and challenges. The escalating impacts of
climate change in the northern waters have created ample opportunities
for Arctic shipping activities related to cargo shipping, fishing,
expedition cruise tourism, mineral resource exploration, science, and
naval activities. Visual observation using satellite images can help in
selecting safer routes to avoid icebergs and sea ice. However, extreme
weather events and the effects of climate change such as Arctic
cyclones, unexpectedly high ocean waves, and rapid sea ice drift may
increase uncertainties in forecasts and make navigation unsafe.
Well-established communication and information-sharing between
researchers and ship crews are crucial for all kinds of vessels to make
information complete, precise, and available. In addition, together with
international maritime laws and policies and the Polar Code, a
development of a shared governance framework to cope with the various
challenges stemming from the climate change impact will be crucial in
the future.

#### Ice melt will not lead to a proliferation of Arctic shipping

**Camacho 24,** editor at E&E news, ( Camacho august 5, 2024, "Hazardous
Melting Ice Could Sink Arctic Shipping",

Gcorb

[[Climate change is thinning]{.mark} Arctic [Sea ice]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} [contrary to]{.mark} [conventional]{.mark} [wisdom]{.mark}
[that's making shipping]{.mark} through the North American Arctic [more
difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline} A study published in *Nature* looked at
Canada's Northwest Passage over 15 years. It [found that the [melting
of]{.mark} local [ice]{.mark} due to global warming [enables
thicker]{.mark} [ice from Greenland to flow]{.mark} [into]{.mark} the
corridor's [choke points]{.mark}, [reducing]{.mark} the length of time
when [ships can move through]{.mark} the [passage.]{.mark}]{.underline}
"First-year ice, that\'s retreating. But it means the thick ice ---
multiyear ice --- is then more able to flow down into those areas," lead
author Alison Cook, a researcher at the Scottish Association for Marine
Science and the University of Ottawa, said in an interview. [[That
thicker ice poses hazards for ships]{.mark}, such as damage or sinking
if there's a collision.]{.underline} The [[results contradict]{.mark}
the common [view that]{.mark} the [Northwest Passage]{.mark}, the Arctic
Ocean [waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific,]{.mark}]{.underline}
is an increasingly practical option for commercial shipping. It even
surprised Cook. "I certainly was assuming the season length was becoming
longer everywhere, and it just wasn\'t," she said. Cook and her
colleagues looked at historical ice charts of the Northwest Passage and
converted those into season lengths. [The seasons indicate the number of
weeks where medium ice-strength ships can traverse the passage without
taking extra safety precautions.]{.underline} Four regions saw
significant changes. In three, the shipping season was shortened by 50
to 70 percent between 2007 and 2021. In one --- the eastern Lancaster
Sound --- the season length grew by 15 percent. Shipping seasons
typically run between 15 and 25 weeks, though it fluctuates heavily
between years and regions. [[Changing ice]{.mark} has
[discouraged]{.mark} at least one [passenger cruise line from
sailing]{.mark} the passage.]{.underline} Scenic Luxury Cruises and
Tours crossed the Northwest Passage in 2022, but "because of the
sensitive environment and ever-changing ice conditions and weather
conditions of the Arctic, they redeployed their sailings after that
season," said Michelle Abril, vice president of Coyne PR and a
spokesperson for Scenic. "They are not currently sailing there or have
itineraries set through Q1 2027 to visit that region." Despite the
shrinking seasons, crossings have --- on average --- increased over the
past decade, according to data provided to POLITICO's E&E News by the
Canadian Coast Guard. "Over the coming years, the Canadian Coast Guard
anticipates an increase in arctic traffic, due to increased tourism,
commercial shipping, and adventuring opportunities," the Coast Guard
said in a statement. While the trends show voyages rising and season
lengths decreasing, there are a couple of explanations for that apparent
contradiction. The first is demand. Shipping companies are eyeing
alternatives to the narrow and congested Panama Canal. And adventure
tourists are eager to trek into the Arctic. Then, there's the location
of multiyear ice. The three regions where the study found shorter
shipping seasons are along the northern route of the Northwest Passage.
The southern route remains mostly unaffected by the thicker ice coming
down from Greenland. "The southern route of the Northwest Passage,
that\'s where there is an increase in ships going through," Cook
explained. "People have their eye on the northern parts of the Northwest
Passage. It\'s shorter. People would want to go that way more than the
southern, but they still haven\'t really because of the presence of
ice." The Danish maritime logistics company Royal Wagenborg, which ships
through the Northwest Passage, declined a request for comment citing
"confidential information." Stephen Howell, one of Cook's co-authors and
a research scientist for the Climate Research Division at the
Environment and Climate Change Canada government department[, said the
thicker [ice from farther north]{.mark} will [continue to flow]{.mark}
down [and endanger ships along the northern route]{.mark} for decades to
come.]{.underline} "Ten years, 20 years --- as long as that ice is still
there, the risk is going to be still there," Howell said in an
interview. Yet even the thicker ice will eventually melt because of
rising temperatures, said Julienne Stroeve, a scientist with the
National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado,
Boulder. "I would imagine if we don't drastically reduce GHG emissions,
after 2050 there will not be a lot of ice to enter into the \[Canadian
Arctic Archipelago\] from the Arctic Ocean and thus the \[Northwest
Passage\] will mostly be ice-free in summer," Stroeve said.

closed for a good long while]{.underline},\" said Dustin Meyers, senior
vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade
organization that represents major oil firms including Exxon Mobil,
Chevron Corp, and ConocoPhillips. \"[There is always the [risk that
these **areas could be reclosed**]{.mark} after the next election
cycle]{.underline},\" he said, adding that is the key issue that could
temper interest from oil companies in the short term to pursue new
drilling projects there. [Drilling in the Arctic and Alaska is a

Conoco is among the most active oil companies in Alaska's Arctic, and
secured a federal approval from the Biden administration for its \$8
billion Willow project there in 2023, angering environmental groups. The
U.S. drilling industry trade group AXPC also did not comment. A source
at one major U.S. oil company, who asked not to be named discussing the
matter, said [many [companies are]{.mark} unlikely to pursue projects in
Alaska based on Trump\'s executive order alone, [seeking **long-term

consultancy Rystad said [Trump's use of the \"drill, baby, drill\"
mantra in his inauguration speech overestimates the industry\'s
willingness to prioritize growth over generating shareholder
returns.]{.underline} Drilling in Alaska\'s pristine Arctic refuge has
long been a source of friction between Alaska lawmakers and tribal
corporations seeking to open more acres to drilling to spur economic
growth, and Democratic presidential administrations that sought to
preserve the local ecosystem and wildlife. A 2017 tax law during
Trump\'s first term mandated oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, a 19 million-acre sanctuary for species
including polar bears and Porcupine caribou. But [**[interest has been
sparse]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Biden Interior Department received no
bids from energy companies last year when it offered 400,000 acres of
the refuge, the minimum amount required. ANWR's wild landscape lacks
roads and public facilities, but its 1.6 million-acre coastal area along
the Beaufort Sea is estimated to have up to 11.8 billion barrels of
recoverable oil, enough to supply the U.S. for more than a year and a
half at current rates. Before leaving office this month, Biden banned
new offshore oil and gas drilling in federal waters off the East and
West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of the northern
Bering Sea in Alaska. The move was considered mostly symbolic since it
mainly covered zones that have no important prospects. Trump issued an
order seeking to repeal those protections. Still, the energy industry is
\"cautiously optimistic\" that the Trump administration will continue
easing regulations that have hampered oil and gas development, said
API\'s Meyers. \"The administration deserves a lot of credit for at
least doing everything that they can do to send the signal that these
areas are going to be open for development,\" he said.

### No Arctic War -- No US/Russia War

#### Arctic war is a major misconception -- the situation is stable

https://partner.sciencenorway.no/arctic-climate-conflict/war-in-the-arctic-researchers-debunk-three-myths-about-the-high-north/2314629\]//ds

[[What could lead to a serious conflict in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}? A story from nearly 20 years ago might
provide some clues. It was a cold autumn and the sea was rough.
[Norwegian Coast Guard inspectors were]{.underline} on duty and were far
out to sea, [about to board the Russian trawler Electron, as they had
noticed the vessel was not abiding by protocols.]{.underline} What
followed next put Norwegian diplomacy to the test. The Russian fishermen
took the Norwegian inspectors into Russian waters, and were pursued by
Norwegian Coast Guard ships and helicopters[. It later emerged that the
Norwegian Naval Special Operations Command had also been
mobilised.]{.underline} Could have ended differently today [After
delicate diplomatic efforts, Norway managed to get the Russian
authorities to instruct the trawler to release the Norwegians and hand
over Electron's vessel documents. The Coast Guard is part of the
Norwegian defence. To avoid escalating the conflict, it was crucial that
the Russian Northern Fleet was kept out of the area.]{.underline} "The
Electron incident occurred in 2005. If this had happened in 2024, it\'s
not certain it would have ended as well," Andreas Østhagen says. He is a
senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute (FNI). He studies
Arctic geopolitics, seeking to identify factors that could lead to
dangerous security flare ups in the Arctic. Everything that could have
gone wrong "When thinking about potential conflict in the North, it\'s
precisely a scenario like the Electron case that could spiral out of
control," Østhagen says. What would have happened if the fishery
inspectors were armed? What if the weather had been good enough for the
marines to board the ship? What if the admirals of the Russian Northern
Fleet were not interested in de-escalation? Many things could have gone
wrong, contributing to an escalation of the conflict rather than keeping
the tumult at as low a level as possible. Østhagen envisions two
scenarios for conflict in the North: A low-scale incident that escalates
or a full-blown crisis, which, in that case, would be linked to
something much larger than the Arctic where Russia plays a key role. He
references the situation in Ukraine and the currenty global instability.
"There is no doubt that interest in the Arctic is increasing, both
commercially and in terms of a geopolitical power play," he says.
Geopolitics deals with how a country\'s politics, history, and society
are shaped based on its geography. [The [situation is **calmer than
expected**]{.mark}]{.underline} But Østhagen believes [[there
are]{.mark} **three [major misconceptions]{.mark}** about geopolitics in
the Arctic]{.underline}: [The **[first is the possibility of
war]{.mark}** in the Arctic. The **[second is]{.mark} that there are
[unresolved borders]{.mark}** in the Arctic and that a resource race is
underway. The third is that climate change is the primary catalyst for
all changes in the Arctic region]{.underline}. ["The [reality is **much
calmer**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" Østhagen says. "The Electron
case illustrates well everything that can go wrong. But it also shows
why things usually dont go wrong. There\'s a willingness to cooperate,\"
Svein Vigeland Rottem says. He is a senior researcher at FNI and studies
cooperation in the Arctic. [Rottem and Østhagen do not agree that the
Arctic is a powder keg and a dangerous place]{.underline}, as recently
stated by Lars Saunes, former head of the Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian
Broadcasting Corporation NRK. Myth 1: The possibility of war in the
Arctic [Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the
Arctic, explains that the [conditions in the Arctic are often **more
stable and transparent than many assume**]{.mark}**.** **Conflict is not
easily triggered**, considering the vast areas and diverse countries
involved. Østhagen emphasises the enormity of the Arctic, which
encompasses eight countries, four million people, and extensive ocean
areas.]{.underline} The countries include Russia, the Nordic states, the
USA, and Canada. He notes that the [significant Russian
presence]{.underline} -- with almost half of the Arctic landmass under
Russian control -- [influences perceptions of geopolitics in the
North.]{.underline} Iver B. Neumann, a Russia researcher and director at
the FNI, concurs that [the [Arctic is]{.mark} **[less likely]{.mark} to
witness armed conflict** [than other]{.mark} global
[locations.]{.mark}]{.underline} He believes the primary driver for
military conflict in the Arctic is Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base
for nuclear weapons. "There are three main ways to keep such weapons
mobile: in aircraft, on land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where
such submarines exist, as in Murmansk, there is also significant
military attention. And where there is military attention, there is also
the potential for conflict," he says. Neumann advises caution in
responding to Russia\'s desire for global attention and military
control, stressing the importance of Norway maintaining a cool head,
enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to intimidation. Myth 2:
Unresolved borders and a race for resources [As the Arctic becomes more
accessible due to melting sea ice because of climate change, a common
myth suggests a scramble for resources and land in the North will
occur.]{.underline} But Østhagen clarifies that, unlike in other parts
of the world, [there are **[almost no disputes over]{.mark} Arctic
[borders]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "[All the borders are settled," he
says, noting that the [last conflict]{.mark} between Canada and
Greenland was [resolved]{.mark} [in 2022]{.mark}.]{.underline} Maritime
boundaries are key for resource management and potential conflict. Law
of the sea grants coastal states sovereign rights for resource
exploitation in their economic zones. In the Arctic, [**only one**
maritime boundary remains unresolve]{.underline}. It is between the USA
and Canada -- two close allies. [Østhagen]{.underline}, who wrote his
PhD on maritime disputes[, foresees **no major concerns** regarding
sovereignty or territorial issues. He believes the [myth persists due to
historical reasons]{.mark} but emphasises that, with [all]{.mark} the
[land borders settled]{.mark} and just one disputed sea border, **Arctic
resources are already distributed** among the eight Arctic
states.]{.underline} Myth 3: Climate change drives all shifts in the
Arctic A third myth suggests that climate change is the main driver for
all political shifts in the Arctic. But Østhagen cautions against
oversimplifying the issue, noting that while climate change does affect
fish migration -- leading to potential future conflicts around
resource-rich areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to be specific
about which aspects of climate change increase conflict risks. Another
claim Østhagen addresses is the notion that Russia's military buildup in
the Arctic is climate change-driven. He suggests that this is only
partially true, as Russia is generally strengthening its military. The
Arctic, traditionally seen as secure due to inaccessibility and ice
cover, hosts many of Russia's nuclear weapons. "Putin's aim to rebuild
Russia as a military superpower, with credible nuclear deterrence,
involves deploying weapons to strategic locations like the Kola
Peninsula," Østhagen says. With climate changes, increased shipping
activity in Russian Arctic waters becomes more feasible. "Therefore, it
is perhaps not surprising that Russia wants to maintain control over its
northern territories," the researcher says. However, according to
Østhagen, Russia's military buildup in the region is more about
relations with NATO than the changing climate.

#### No risk of US/Russia war on the Arctic -- neither side desires conflict

mm

[The Arctic is so remote]{.underline}, so cut off from the rest of the
world, [that]{.underline} at times [it appears to defy the normal rules
of politics]{.underline}. [Relations between the United States and
Russia]{.underline}, for example, [have been deteriorating for
years]{.underline}. Recently, [the two]{.underline} countries [have
clashed in]{.underline} practically [every]{.underline} geopolitical
[arena]{.underline} around the world---[except]{.underline}, it seemed,
[in the Arctic.]{.underline} At the Arctic Council, the region's main
diplomatic forum, Washington and Moscow have worked side by side.
Together with the council's other members, they have agreed on the need
to protect the region's fragile ecosystem and established protocols to
ensure that its abundant natural resources are developed for commercial
use in an ecologically responsible fashion. And in the decades following
the end of the Cold War, they both scaled back their military presence.
Now, that spirit of cooperation is fraying. As the Arctic's icecap melts
away, new trade routes are emerging and with them a set of new security
challenges. [Over the past several years, Russia has rebuilt its
military presence]{.underline} along the Northern Sea Route---the newly
accessible shipping lane that runs from just east of Norway all the way
to the Bering Strait---in order to ensure safe passage for container
ships, counter smuggling and other illicit activities, and defend
several thousand miles of northern border left unprotected by the
retreating ice. Throughout the region, Moscow is enhancing its military
capabilities. In 2014, Russia created a new military district with
responsibility for the entire Arctic region, stretching from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and in 2017 it began to build a
small fleet of icebreaking vessels equipped for antisubmarine warfare,
although the ships will not enter service for several years. Russian
strategic air patrols off the coast of Alaska, which resumed back in
2007, and their routine interception by U.S. military jets have also
drawn more attention recently as suspicions of Russian intentions mount
in Washington. NATO, meanwhile, has voiced concerns about increased
Russian submarine movements near the so-called GIUK (Greenland, Iceland,
United Kingdom) gap, a naval chokepoint in the North Atlantic. Partly in
response to all this activity, [the United States is rebuilding its own
military capabilities]{.underline} in the region, which have atrophied
since the end of the Cold War. Besides tracking Russian submarines near
the GIUK gap, Washington has stepped up its strategic air patrols off
the coast of Siberia to probe Russian defense systems and gather other
intelligence. The Trump administration also plans to build a fleet of
icebreakers to carry out what it has referred to as "national and
economic security missions" in the Arctic. Additional investments will
likely be necessary down the line, both to police commercial activities
along the Alaskan coast and throughout the U.S. exclusive economic zone
and to defend the country's commitment to freedom of navigation in the
polar region. [Neither side's actions are necessarily aggressive in
nature]{.underline}, **[nor do they portend an impending geopolitical
fight over who controls the region]{.underline}**. In fact,
[Russia's]{.underline} [military buildup has taken place solely in areas
where its legal authority is undisputed.]{.underline} Submarine and
aircraft activity near the GIUK gap and off the Alaskan coast is a part
of Russia's global strategy to deter potential military attacks and not
focused on the Arctic per se. [Much the same is true of U.S. actions in
and around the region.]{.underline}

[see]{.mark} [Arctic cooperation as]{.mark}]{.underline} a potential
[[means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and
Beijing.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In my [meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian diplomats and

that many [are interested in]{.mark} diverse [forms]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[Arctic cooperation]{.mark},]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[cultural]{.mark} diplomacy]{.underline} that [celebrates the
commonalities of Indigenous peoples]{.underline} on both sides of the

understand and adapt to climate hazards]{.underline} faced by both
nations. [[Business interests]{.mark},]{.underline} however,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [at the [top of the
agenda]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. [[Putin's
offer]{.mark} to open Russian rare earth minerals [to joint
exploration]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with the US]{.underline}]{.mark} may
also [[have implications for Arctic cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

The announced [[plan to revamp diplomatic relations]{.underline}]{.mark}
and restore the staff of the countries' diplomatic missions
[[will]{.mark} significantly [reduce]{.mark} the current [obstacles to
US-Russia scientific cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. By
making it easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries,
[Americans and Russians will again be able to conduct joint research,
expeditions, and scientific conferences]{.underline} and build models to
better understand the unfolding climate emergency. Scientific
cooperation to understand the changes affecting sea ice, permafrost,
ecosystems, and local communities has been blunted by the political
fallout of the war in Ukraine.

[[Cooperation in the Arctic]{.mark} [can]{.mark} help [build regional

#### Russia is willing to cooperate with the West on Arctic Development

**Al Jazeera '25** \[3/27/2025, Al Jazeera, "Russia's Putin eyes Arctic
cooperation despite geopolitical tensions,"
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/27/russias-putin-eyes-arctic-cooperation-despite-geopolitical-tensions\]//ds

[Geopolitical rivalries are intensifying in the Arctic, but [Russia is
**willing to cooperate** with foreign partners, including from the
Wes]{.mark}t, in economic ventures there that will benefit all
sides,]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. In a
major speech on Thursday, Putin said US President Donald Trump's stated
intention to acquire Greenland was "serious", and [it was clear that the
US would continue to promote its interests in the Arctic]{.underline}.
The Greenland question had nothing to do with Russia, he said. But
Moscow was concerned that "NATO countries in general are increasingly
designating the far north as a springboard for possible conflicts,
practising the use of troops in these conditions, including by their
'new recruits', Finland and Sweden," he said, referring to the
alliance's newest members. Russia was monitoring the situation and
building a response, including by boosting its military capabilities in
the region. "We will not allow encroachments on the sovereignty of our
country and will reliably protect our national interests," Putin said.
Reporting from Moscow, Yulia Shapovalova said [the Russian president's
[priority is **developing the region's infrastructure**]{.mark} to
[improve]{.mark} people's **[living condition]{.mark}** and to get
better [access to the natural resources]{.mark} of the
Arctic.]{.underline} "[[Putin sees many prospects for **further
development**]{.mark} of the region -- the most important direction is
the **[strengthening of transport and logistics]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}," she said. "[Russia is also keen to develop the
Northern Sea Route, which is the shortest shipping route connecting
western Eurasia with the Asia Pacific region -- but [the country is not
going to go it alone. It's **ready to cooperate**,]{.mark} ready for
prospects in the Arctic]{.underline}," Shapovalova said. Focus on the
Arctic's strategic importance for mining, shipping and security has
increased sharply because of repeated statements by Trump that he wants
to acquire Greenland. He has not ruled out doing so by force. The Arctic
holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and the seabed that
could become more accessible with global warming. It is also an area of
military competition, where defence analysts say Russia has built up its
presence much faster than the West by reopening Soviet-era bases and
modernising its navy. The US sees the Arctic as crucial for national
security, including for its early warning system against nuclear
attacks. The Kremlin says [the Arctic is a zone of Russian strategic
interest, and suggested in February that [**Russia and the US could work
together** to develop natural resources there]{.mark} as the two
countries pursue a fast-moving rapprochement that has unnerved Ukraine
and its European allies.]{.underline}

### No Arctic War---AT Resource War

#### No resource conflicts in the Arctic -- incentives for cooperation outweigh motivations for conflict

[Advocates of an]{.underline} interest-driven [arms race over the North
Pole]{.underline} often [point to]{.underline} the growing economic
potential of the region, overlapping territorial claims, and an
increasing "[militarization" of the Arctic]{.underline} region.4
[However, there are]{.underline} good [reasons]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} more [carefully examine the underlying
assumptions]{.underline} about power and interests on which such
analyses are based. I would like to begin with the most commonly used
argument for the risk of military confrontation in the Arctic: the
region's enormous economic potential and the conflicting interests of
major Arctic stakeholders. In 2008, a US Geological Survey report
estimated that the Arctic probably contains the largest untapped oil and
gas reserves in the world.5 In addition, the increasing accessibility of
the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route are of major economic
interest, as they considerably reduce the transit times between the
Atlantic and the Pacific while avoiding unsecure waters such as those
around the Horn of Africa.6 [Controlling]{.underline} both the [natural
resources and]{.underline} these [shipping routes is considered a matter
of great significance]{.underline} by the five Arctic littoral states of
Norway, Denmark, Canada, Russia, and the United States. Their [recent
submissions under the]{.underline} United Nations Convention on [the Law
of the Sea]{.underline} (UNCLOS)7 for the extension of their continental
shelves (and thus the right to exploit the resources in the seabed) [are
seen by some as provocative]{.underline}, [and overlaps
among]{.underline} proposed are[as of interest are believed to contain
imminent potential for conflict]{.underline}.8 [However]{.underline}, a
few major points should be considered. First, [the
submissions]{.underline} to UNCLOS [are in full accordance with
international]{.underline} law and can hardly be described as
provocative. They consist solely in the filing of scientific data with
the Commission on the Limits of the Con- tinental Shelf (CLCS) on the
extension of the littoral states' continental shelves. The CLCS assesses
the various submissions before making recommendations on how to proceed.
While the Commission has no mandate to resolve overlapping claims, the
UNCLOS refers to various mechanisms for dispute settlement.9 The
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} littoral [[states]{.underline}
[have]{.underline}]{.mark} so far [always [followed a path of peaceful
dispute settlement]{.mark}]{.underline} and reaffirmed their commitment
to international law "and to the orderly settlement of any possible
overlapping claims"10 at the Arctic Ocean Conference in 2008 in
Ilulissat. With the signing of the border delimitation treaty between
Norway and Russia in 2010,11 only a few overlaps remain, with little
actual conflict potential.12 Considering that [[resource extraction far
out in the Arctic Ocean is highly unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
dispute between Canada, Denmark, and Russia over who owns the North Pole
is mainly symbolic, and, in 2015, [[Russia]{.mark} already
[indicated]{.mark} its [readiness to negotiate]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[overlapping claims]{.underline}]{.mark} there.13 Disputes such as the
one over Hans Island (a "rock" in the Nares Strait between Canada and
Greenland) have even become "running gags", with military forces from
Canada and Denmark leaving bottles of Danish schnapps and Canadian
whisky on the island along with signs welcoming the other side.14
Finally, it is often overlooked that [[the vast majority of]{.mark}
predicted [resources are located either within]{.mark}]{.underline}
Exclusive Economic Zones ([[EEZs]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[or]{.mark} in
[areas that are claimed by only one Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} littoral
[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}, of which Russia has by far the largest
share.15 In addition, [[the harsh Arctic climate makes resource
extraction extremely difficult and]{.underline}]{.mark}, due to the lack
of the necessary infrastructure, approximately [[twice as
expensive]{.mark} as anywhere else]{.underline} in the world. This is
particularly true for extraction offshore, where it is assumed that most
undiscovered resources lie. Many studies thus conclude not only that it
will remain very expensive, but also that [[it is highly unlikely
that]{.mark} the bulk of [Arctic resources will be allocated
unilaterally]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 In other words, [the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} littoral [[states have the most to lose
from a military confrontation]{.mark}, as they are required to
co-operate for technical reasons if they want to access the economic
benefits of their regional share]{.underline}. International sanctions
on oil and gas equipment following the illegal annexation of Crimea
have, for example, basically brought Russia's Arctic resource extraction
programmes to a complete halt.

### No Arctic War---No Escalation

#### No risk of Arctic war -- military capabilities are overstated and environmental conditions make conflict impossible 

Benjamin **Schaller**, **2018**, OSCE Yearbook 2017, "Defusing the

Confidence-and Security-Building Measures in the Arctic Region,"

[[The harsh Arctic climate]{.underline}]{.mark} not only has severe
consequences for the profitability of Arctic resource extraction, but
also [[places practical constraints on]{.mark} the conduct of [military
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the large Arctic Ocean covered in
ice for most of the year, and temperatures that can drop below minus 40
degrees Celsius, [the overall [military presence]{.mark} in the Arctic
[is]{.mark} still relatively [low]{.mark}]{.underline} in comparison to
other regions[. [Sustaining]{.mark} [military infrastructure]{.mark} and
even conducting military activities]{.underline} (e.g. exercises) [[are
highly expensive]{.mark} and pose severe challenges]{.underline} to
service members and equipment. Consequently, [[armed forces in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[more [a symbol]{.mark} of national sovereignty]{.underline} and
prestige [than of military power projection]{.underline}. An exemplary
illustration is provided by the Danish elite navy unit "Slædepatruljen
Sirius" (Sirius Dog Sled Patrol). Studies have shown that the extreme
cold and darkness have a considerable impact on the physical and
psychological health of the participating soldiers.17 The unit,
consisting of twelve soldiers split up into dogsled teams of two,
patrols approximately 16,000 kilometres of coastline in Northern
Greenland.18 Due to the extremely low temperatures, the unit is equipped
with the M1917 Enfield, a bolt-action rifle used during the First World
War. More modern, gas-operated semi-automatic rifles are far less
reliable in the cold environment of Northern Greenland and put the
soldiers at greater risk of attack by polar bears. [[The Arctic]{.mark}
also [places constraints]{.mark} on the deployment of other conventional
military equipment such as battle [tanks and heavy
artillery]{.mark}]{.underline}, which require a far more elaborate
military infrastructure in low temperatures (e.g. for preheating engines
or maintenance) than currently exists in the region.19 [Military
capabilities]{.underline} in the Arctic [and]{.underline} national
moder[nization plans in the region]{.underline} also [seem]{.underline}
to be [overstated]{.underline}. [Despite warnings of
"militarization]{.underline}" or an "arms race" in the Arctic, [two
consecutive studies by]{.underline} the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute ([[SIPRI]{.underline}]{.mark}) from 2012 and 2016
[[draw a less alarming picture]{.underline}]{.mark}. They both conclude
that the [military presence]{.underline} in the region [continues to be
small in scale and far below Cold War levels]{.underline}.
[[Arctic]{.mark} military [modernization]{.mark} and procurement
plans]{.underline} -- which tend to be particularly costly -- often
[[proceed slowly or are]{.mark} even [completely called
off]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Most changes]{.underline} that do take place
have little to do with offensive military postures and the safeguarding
of territorial claims; instead, [they are connected with protecting and
policing territorial waters and existing state borders and supporting
Search and Rescue]{.underline} (SAR) [operations]{.underline}.20
Looking, for example, at the sparsely populated northern parts of Russia
and Canada, it is not surprising that these tasks are undertaken, or at
least supported, by specifically trained and equipped military
personnel. As the former Chief of the Canadian Defence Staff, General
Walter Natynczyk, once put it: "If someone were to invade the Canadian
Arctic, my first task would be to rescue them."21 To sum up, [there are
good reasons to believe that [military conflict is highly unlikely to
break out in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the harsh Arctic
climate and rudimentary infrastructure have always fostered particularly
close cooperation]{.underline} in the sparsely populated High North,
[and the]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline} littoral [states]{.underline}
in particular [have much more to lose than to gain from military
confrontation]{.underline} if they intend to make the Arctic
economically useable. In addition, [the level of military presence in
the Arctic is often exaggerated, and many practical constraints are
usually overlooked]{.underline}.

#### Escalation in the Arctic is impossible---Geography and lack of capability limit any risk of conflict

forward-looking analysis based on policies and practices.",
<https://doi.org/10.1186/s40309-025-00250-y>**\] CK**

[Despite intensifying re-securitization factors in Arctic governance,
the [likelihood of]{.mark} direct [military conflict remains]{.mark}
comparatively **[low]{.mark}**, as the region's geopolitical
[competition]{.mark} [is bounded]{.mark} [by]{.mark} three constraints:
the [mutual dilution of]{.mark} strategic [resources]{.mark}, the
[harsh]{.mark} natural [environment]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the buffering
role of [institutional resilience]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[First, the mutual [dilution of]{.mark} strategic [resources]{.mark}
[curtails]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} [for]{.mark} military
[escalation]{.mark}. Russia's deep [entanglement]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[Ukrain]{.mark}ian battlefield has significantly [consumed its
resources]{.mark}, thereby [restraining]{.mark} its [capacity to
projec]{.mark}t military [power in the Arctic]{.mark}. International
sanctions have further impacted Russia's economy and defense industry.
In contrast, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates currently
[operates]{.mark} only [two icebreakers]{.mark}, indicating a
[substantial gap]{.mark} [in]{.mark} its icebreaking
[capability]{.mark}. The next generation of icebreakers is not expected
to be delivered before 2029 \[80\], which will create at least a
decade-long equipment gap.]{.underline}

[Second, the [Arctic's geographic features]{.mark} [serve as a]{.mark}
natural [barrier to]{.mark} conflict [escalation]{.mark}. Its
[extreme]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} [and sparse infrastructure]{.mark}
greatly increase the cost of military operations. For example, research
suggests that the severe weather in the Arctic [heightens]{.mark} the
risk of [drone icing]{.mark} \[81\], thereby [limiting]{.mark} the
[effectiveness]{.mark} [of]{.mark} modern [combat systems]{.mark}.
Additionally, the limited annual navigation window for the Northern Sea
Route [further]{.mark} [constrains military
deployments]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Third, [institutional resilience]{.mark} [helps]{.mark} to
[buffer]{.mark} the [pressures of securitization]{.mark}. Although the
Arctic Council is currently fractured, it has not completely collapsed.
Norway has pursued the gradual resumption of virtual meetings among
working groups, maintaining cooperation in relatively low-sensitivity
areas such as climate monitoring and Indigenous rights \[82\].
[Russia]{.mark}, while suspending economic contribution,
[continues]{.mark} [to hold its membership]{.mark} and
[emphasizes]{.mark} that the [Arctic Counci]{.mark}l remains a [viable
multilateral instrument]{.mark}, signaling that all parties still regard
it as a platform for collaboration \[83\]. This [model]{.mark} of
"limited functional continuity" [creates a]{.mark} protective
[buffer]{.mark} [between geopolitical conflict]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
functional [cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### No Russia-China Axis

#### No Russia-China axis in the Arctic -- cooperation is limited and relations are at risk of tension and collapse

mm

[[Closer engagement between Russia and China has fueled assumptions of
an emerging axis]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The Arctic is often cited as
evidence of Sino-Russian alignment due to their growing Arctic ties
across the security, strategic and commercial spheres]{.underline}.
Beijing frames its Arctic relationship with Russia often in terms of
'win-win' agreements and strategies. This term, 'win-win', reflects
Beijing's Confucius thinking, and indicates that the two countries'
bilateral mutually beneficial interests in the region remain far short
of the increasingly popular assumption of a brewing Arctic alliance.
Resources and transportation (that is, the future history of global
maritime trade) are the two primary strategic interests driving China's
Arctic gambit. All components of the Arctic resource 'prize' are of
interest to Beijing and feature across various policy statements and
indeed within China's 2018 Arctic Strategy. As a burgeoning global trade
power, the ability to cut logistics costs and, indeed, transportation
times, is of central interest to China. Here, the Northern Sea Route
(NSR) -- largely hugging the Russian Arctic coastline -- links Asia to
Europe. Through the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are
connected. Travel time between Asia and Europe via the NSR is about 23
days on average, compared with the Suez Canal's 37-day average. In 2013,
the first Chinese merchant ship transited the NSR and was the first
container vessel ever to do so. China's Arctic interest dates to 1925,
when it acceded to the Spitsbergen (now Svalbard) Treaty. The treaty
benefited the signatories economically by facilitating access to mining
rights on the Svalbard archipelago, while agreeing to protect Svalbard
from any military buildup. This Arctic archipelago's scientific and
research value was further tapped by China in 2004 when Beijing built
the Yellow River Arctic research station -- cementing Chinese presence
in the region. In addition, the Xue Long (Snow Dragon), China's first
icebreaker, has conducted numerous Arctic research expeditions since
1999. Today, it is joined by Xue Long-2, China's first indigenously
built icebreaker. Murmurs of a nuclear-powered icebreaker about to roll
off China's production yard further point to [[Beijing's]{.mark} growing
[polar capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In securing observer status to
the Arctic Council in 2013, China inserted itself into the Arctic
governance ecosystem. But this [[does not place Beijing at the
decision-making table]{.underline}]{.mark} -- observers do not vote or
lead multilateral discussion within the Arctic Council. Beyond
transportation, Beijing seeks to diversify its energy imports across the
globe. This makes the resource-rich Russian Arctic Zone (both inland and
offshore) an attractive component of China's diversification strategy.
[While the Sino-Russian Arctic relationship is predicated on economic
foundations]{.underline}, for now, Russia has yet to fall into Beijing's
'debt-trap diplomacy'. [[Moscow maintains stringent domestic legislation
on joint ventures]{.mark} and ownership of sovereign energy
deposits]{.underline}. This is a delicate balance. Russia relies on
sustained future Chinese demand for Arctic liquified natural gas (LNG),
but [Moscow has also worked to diversify its capital pools]{.underline}.
India, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea are all linked to Russian
Arctic energy ventures in one way or another. China does not have a
majority share in either of the two key LNG projects on the Russian
Arctic's Yamal Peninsula. Beijing's share in the Yamal LNG venture is
29.9%, while Russia's Novatek holds a controlling 50.1% and France's
Total holds 20%. In the Arctic-2 LNG project, China holds 20%, Novatek
60%, Total 10%, and the remaining 10% is held by a Japanese consortium.
Russia's upcoming Arctic energy projects, located in proximity to the
existing Yamal Peninsula ventures Ob (LNG), Vostok (oil), Arctic-1 (LNG)
and Arctic-3 (LNG), can be expected to attract diverse capital pools.
Likewise, [[on the]{.underline}]{.mark} NSR or '[[polar silk
road']{.mark} front, [Russia maintains the upper]{.mark}]{.underline}
(controlling) [[hand]{.underline}]{.mark}. The NSR wraps along the
Russian coastline for most of its route. This is important to Russia for
two reasons. First, much of the NSR falls within Russia's exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) and therefore [Moscow has deemed it necessary to
charge transit tariffs]{.underline}. The tariffs have been accompanied
by Russia's introduction of tight rules and domestic laws for foreign
firms looking to use the route. Second, [Russia insists vessels can only
navigate]{.underline} the NSR [when accompanied by Russian nuclear
icebreakers]{.underline}. Tapping into NSR potential is thus subject to
strict Russian directives. While mutually beneficial interests -- and
the overall sense of 'win-win' agreements -- facilitate close engagement
between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, [it is]{.underline} still
[problematic to assume an Arctic 'axis' is forthcoming]{.underline}.
[China's]{.underline} efforts to increase its [engagement in the Arctic
are occurring far beyond the Russian Arctic Zone]{.underline}. Iceland
was the first European state to sign a free-trade agreement with
Beijing, and China's first intergovernmental framework in the Arctic was
struck with Iceland in 2012. Various Chinese state energy interests have
been floated in geothermal resources in Iceland -- but to date the
projects have been abandoned. In 2018, the China--Iceland Arctic Science
Observatory opened and continues to operate. Iceland strategically
presents as a logistics hub that would act as a key shipping port
between Europe and Asia along the NSR. It seems clear that Chinese
Arctic strategy is to 'internationalise' the Arctic in a way that
features and promotes China's strategic benefit. [China is also driven
by great power ideology]{.underline} and the prestige afforded by having
a global polar footprint. [Russia is aware of this simmering rationale
for Chinese Arctic strategy]{.underline}. Efforts by China to move
beyond the agreed terms of its mutually beneficial arrangement with
Moscow within the Russian Arctic Zone, and how closely China adheres to
the existing legal and sovereign arrangements of the Arctic Ocean, will
certainly be a litmus test for the Sino-Russian Arctic 'alliance'.
Indeed, [[Sino-Russian strategic tensions remain]{.underline}]{.mark},
well beyond the overhanging fear of centuries of mistrust and the issue
of the Russian Far East. In June 2020, Moscow accused one of its leading
Arctic scientists, Valery Mitko, of spying for Beijing. Mitko was
charged with treason for handing over classified information on Arctic
research and submarine sensor technology to China. But perhaps more
telling is the way that both countries have hushed up the incident, with
neither formally commenting on the arrest. For now, Beijing and Moscow
appear to agree to disagree -- so long as Arctic LNG business is
booming. The narrative of Moscow and Beijing working together to carve
up the Arctic riches and take control of new global transport corridors
has started to make its way into the policy and defence planning
documents of Arctic-rim states. Washington's litany of Arctic strategic
planning documents -- Naval, Air Force and Coast Guard strategies --
feature renewed great power competition in the Arctic as a central
security threat. However, [the notion that there is a Sino-Russian
Arctic alliance is a misinterpretation of the realities that drive China
and Russia together in the Arctic]{.underline}. The realities of the
Sino-Russian relationship (dubbed by both as one of 'mutual benefit') in
the Arctic is best grasped when the limits of the partnership are
considered. [There are]{.underline}, first and foremost[, limits in
terms of geographical boundaries]{.underline}. [The [Russian Arctic
Zone]{.mark} is the lion's share of the Arctic region]{.underline}, home
to the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources. [The]{.underline}
Russian Arctic [Zone [is]{.mark} also [the]{.mark} geographical '[limit'
of Sino-Russian Arctic 'cooperation' as well]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of
the eight members of the Arctic Council, Russia took the most convincing
to grant China its observer status in 2013. Moscow approved membership,
and with it, legitimacy, on the basis that Beijing explicitly
acknowledged the sovereignty of Arctic-rim states and reaffirmed its
commitment to the legal architecture of the Arctic region -- the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea. Russia watches, with tempered
suspicion, Beijing's Arctic high sea missions and scientific research
agenda in what China sees as a global commons. Yet within the Russian
Arctic Zone, [Russia welcomes Chinese engagement, but on Kremlin
terms]{.underline}. Since 2014, with Western sanctions over Russia's
annexation of Crimea and sustained aggression in Ukraine, Moscow has had
a cashflow problem. [Despite]{.underline} key economic strategic
[partnerships in the Russian Arctic, China is busy diversifying itself
throughout the region]{.underline}. China is actively engaging with
other Arctic-rim powers and has commercial ventures, investment plans
and entrenched soft-power strategies in Norway, Canada, Iceland and
Denmark (through Greenland). Russia's Arctic strategy is built on both
economic security and frontier border security objectives. The
Sino-Russian relationship lends itself to these economic security
interests and ambitions, but it is less effective at navigating Russia's
Arctic 'siege mentality'. This is largely because of the kind of
increased interest and activity that China is undertaking in the Arctic
-- and against which Russia seeks to secure its vast open frontier. [Any
deterioration in Sino-Russian ties could threaten this delicate
balance]{.underline}. Russian efforts to securitise its economic
interests in the Arctic fall short of an expansionist agenda. Beyond the
posturing, ultimately Moscow's Arctic priority remains regional
stability. Continued regional cooperation with its NATO-member and
Western Arctic neighbours remains a central strategic objective. After
all, keeping the arena free of conflict is crucial to ensuring the NSR
(and Russia's future economic resource base) remains open and
commercially viable. Russia needs to be able to deliver secure, trusted
and unimpeded energy supplies from its northern frontier to Asian and
European energy clients. The same cannot be assumed of Chinese Arctic
interests, with clear indicators of an emerging expansionist agenda.
While much of Beijing's recent Arctic Ocean missions have been primarily
about 'raising the flag' and promoting soft-power public relations
campaigns for domestic consumption, it is evident that China is set to
stay in the Arctic. While much of the Arctic Ocean is delineated by
territorial seas and agreed maritime boundaries, the central Arctic
Ocean does hold international waters, which facilitates Chinese
engagement. [[Fragmentation of Sino-Russian
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic context [[might]{.mark} yet
[emerge from the outcomes of the Arctic continental shelf
debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} Via the UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all submitted formal,
yet overlapping, claims to this continental shelf. Should a claim be
upheld, the awarded state will then claim exclusive rights to the seabed
and the resources beneath the area of the North Pole. This would block
China's access to seabed or resources in the international Arctic waters
around the North Pole. Overall, [continued efforts to put Moscow and
Beijing in the same 'basket' when it comes to great power competition in
the Arctic 'great game' is short-sighted and misses critical
opportunities to futureproof the Arctic as a zone of international
cooperation, collaboration and low tension]{.underline}. Sino-Russian
Arctic ties will continue to be predictable to a large extent. Ties will
remain mutually beneficial -- until they are not. Predicting this point
should be the priority for Arctic stakeholders. The problem appears to
be, for now, that many stakeholders assume a fractured or fragmented
Sino-Russian Arctic relationship does not exist. [[Russia and China's
Arctic relationship is not an alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} -- it is
driven by 'win-win' thinking. Such framing is extremely subjective and
prone to change. Despite mutually beneficial interests in the region[,
commercial realpolitik is at the heart of their engagement]{.underline}.
For now, the partnership in the Arctic navigates existing fault lines
elsewhere, such as Beijing's failure to acknowledge Russia's annexation
of Crimea and Moscow's nonalignment in the developing India--China
conflict. [Sino-Russian mutually beneficial cooperation and engagement
within the Russian Arctic Zone is not a Sino-Russian alliance in the
Arctic]{.underline}. In a somewhat Confucius-informed position, Beijing
wants to 'seek harmony and keep differences' when it comes to engagement
with Russia in the Arctic. Both countries will remain engaged
proactively and collaboratively across industrialisation projects,
diplomatic relations and various commercial dealings in the Russian
Arctic Zone. But when this 'win-win' situation sours, Western Arctic
states may indeed be faced with another Arctic security threat -- a
conflict between Russia and China in the Arctic.

In public, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says his country's
growing friendship with China is unshakable --- a strategic military and
economic collaboration that has entered a golden era. But in the
corridors of Lubyanka, the headquarters of [[Russia's]{.mark} domestic
[security agency]{.mark}]{.underline}, known as the F.S.B., a secretive
intelligence unit [[refers to the Chinese as "the
enemy]{.mark}."]{.underline} This unit, which has not previously been
disclosed, has warned that China is a serious threat to Russian
security. [[Its officers say]{.mark} that [Beijing is]{.mark}
increasingly [trying to recruit Russian spies]{.mark} and get its hands
on sensitive military technology]{.underline}, at times by luring
disaffected Russian scientists. The intelligence officers say that China
is spying on the Russian military's operations in Ukraine to learn about
Western weapons and warfare. They fear that Chinese academics are laying
the groundwork to make claims on Russian territory. And [they have
warned that Chinese intelligence agents are carrying out espionage in
the Arctic]{.underline} using mining firms and university research
centers as cover. The threats are laid out in an eight-page internal
F.S.B. planning document, obtained by The New York Times, that sets
priorities for fending off Chinese espionage. The document is undated,
raising the possibility that it is a draft, though it appears from
context to have been written in late 2023 or early 2024. Ares Leaks, a
cybercrime group, obtained the document but did not say how it did so.
That makes definitive authentication impossible, but The Times shared
the report with six Western intelligence agencies, all of which assessed
it to be authentic. [The document gives the most detailed
behind-the-scenes view to date of Russian counterintelligence's thinking
about China]{.underline}. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022,
Moscow's new bond with Beijing has shifted the global balance of power.
The rapidly expanding partnership is one of the most consequential, and
opaque, relationships in modern geopolitics. Russia has survived years
of Western financial sanctions following the invasion, proving wrong the
many politicians and experts who predicted the collapse of the country's
economy. That survival is in no small part due to China. China is the
largest customer for Russian oil and provides essential computer chips,
software and military components. When Western companies fled Russia,
Chinese brands stepped in to replace them. The two countries say they
want to collaborate in a vast number of areas, including making movies
and building a base on the moon. Mr. Putin and Xi Jinping, China's
leader, are doggedly pursuing what they call a partnership with "no
limits." But the top-secret F.S.B. memo shows there are, in fact,
limits. "You have the political leadership, and these guys are all for
rapprochement with China," said Andrei Soldatov, an expert on Russia's
intelligence services who lives in exile in Britain and who reviewed the
document at the request of The Times. "You have the intelligence and
security services, and they are very suspicious." Mr. Putin's spokesman,
Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to comment. The Chinese Foreign Ministry did
not respond to requests for comment on the document. [[The Russian
document describes a "tense and dynamically developing" intelligence
battle]{.mark} in the shadows between the two outwardly friendly
nations.]{.underline} Three days before Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine in
2022, the F.S.B. approved a new counterintelligence program called
"Entente-4," the document reveals. The code name, an apparent
tongue-in-cheek reference to Moscow's growing friendship with Beijing,
belied the initiative's real intent: to prevent Chinese spies from
undermining Russian interests. The timing almost certainly was not
accidental. Russia was diverting nearly all of its military and spy
resources to Ukraine, more than 4,000 miles from its border with China,
and most likely worried that Beijing could try to capitalize on this
distraction. Since then, according to the document, the F.S.B. observed
China doing just that. Chinese intelligence agents stepped up efforts to
recruit Russian officials, experts, journalists and businesspeople close
to power in Moscow, the document says. To counter this, the F.S.B.
instructed its officers to intercept the "threat" and "prevent the
transfer of important strategic information to the Chinese." Officers
were ordered to conduct in-person meetings with Russian citizens who
work closely with China and warn them that Beijing was trying to take
advantage of Russia and obtain advanced scientific research, according
to the document. The F.S.B. ordered "the constant accumulation of
information about users" on the Chinese messaging app WeChat. That
included hacking phones of espionage targets and analyzing the data in a
special software tool held by a unit of the F.S.B., the document says.
The possible long-term alignment of two authoritarian governments, with
a combined population of nearly 1.6 billion people and armed with some
6,000 nuclear warheads, has stoked deep concern in Washington. Some
members of the Trump administration believe that, through outreach to
Mr. Putin, Washington can begin to peel Russia away from China and avoid
what Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called "two nuclear powers
aligned against the United States." "I'm going to have to un-unite them,
and I think I can do that, too," Donald J. Trump said shortly before his
election in November. "I have to un-unite them." Read one way, the
F.S.B. document lends credence to the theory that, with the right
approach, Russia can be cleaved away from China. The document describes
mistrust and suspicion on both sides of the relationship. China is
conducting polygraphs on its agents as soon as they return home,
tightening scrutiny of the 20,000 Russian students in China and trying
to recruit Russians with Chinese spouses as potential spies, the
document says. But another reading of the document leads to the opposite
conclusion. The fact that Mr. Putin is apparently well aware of the
risks of a closer relationship with China and has decided to push ahead
anyway could suggest little opportunity for the United States to get
Russia to change course. "Putin believes that he can go much deeper into
this Chinese embrace, and it's not risk free, but it is worth it," said
Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center,
who reviewed the document at the request of The Times. "But we also see
there are people within the system who are skeptical of that approach."
Mr. Putin has courted Mr. Xi for years, in more than 40 personal
meetings, and has cemented a far deeper partnership with China since
invading Ukraine. The two countries have a natural economic synergy,
with Russia being one of the world's largest energy producers and China
the world's largest energy consumer. That poses a delicate challenge for
Russian counterintelligence agents. The document shows them trying to
contain the risks posed by Chinese intelligence without causing
"negative consequences for bilateral relations." Officers were warned to
avoid any public "mention of the Chinese intelligence services as a
potential enemy." Most likely written for circulation to F.S.B. field
offices, the directive offers a rare glimpse into the inner world of one
of the most powerful parts of the Russian intelligence establishment:
the F.S.B.'s Department for Counterintelligence Operations, known as the
D.K.R.O. The document was written by the D.K.R.O.'s 7th Service, which
is responsible for countering espionage from China and other parts of
Asia. [Anxiety about Russia's susceptibility to an increasingly powerful
Beijing dominates the memo.]{.underline} But it is unclear how common
those worries are across the Russian establishment, beyond the
counterintelligence unit. Even allied nations regularly spy on one
another. "To go back to the old adage, there is no such thing as
friendly intel services," said Paul Kolbe, a senior fellow at Harvard's
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, who served for 25
years in the C.I.A. Directorate of Operations, including in Russia. "You
don't have to scratch very deep in any Russian military or intel
official to get deep suspicion of China. In the long run, China is, in
spite of the unlimited partnership and how useful they are, also a
potential threat." Soon after Russian troops pushed across the border
into Ukraine, officials from Chinese defense firms and institutes tied
to Chinese intelligence began flooding into Russia. Their goal,
according to the F.S.B. document, was to better understand the war.
China has world-class scientists, but its military has not fought a war
since a monthlong conflict with Vietnam in 1979. The result is anxiety
in China about how its military would perform against Western weapons in
a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea. Chinese intelligence
officials are eager to understand Russia's fight against an army backed
by the West. "Of particular interest to Beijing is information about
combat methods using drones, modernization of their software and methods
for countering new types of Western weapons," the F.S.B. document says,
adding that Beijing believes the war in Ukraine will become drawn-out.
The conflict has revolutionized warfare technology and tactics. China
has long lagged behind Russia in its aviation expertise, and the
document says that Beijing has made that a priority target. China is
targeting military pilots and researchers in aerohydrodynamics, control
systems and aeroelasticity. Also being sought out, according to the
document, are Russian specialists who worked on the discontinued
ekranoplan, a hovercraft-type warship first deployed by the Soviet
Union. "Priority recruitment is given to former employees of aircraft
factories and research institutes, as well as current employees who are
dissatisfied with the closure of the ekranoplan development program by
the Russian Ministry of Defense or who are experiencing financial
difficulties," the report says. It is not clear from the document
whether those recruitment efforts are limited to hiring Russian
specialists for Chinese ventures or also extend to recruiting them as
spies. The document also shows that Russia is very concerned about how
China views the war in Ukraine and is trying to feed Beijing's spies
with positive information about Russian operations. And it commands
Russian counterintelligence operatives to prepare a report for the
Kremlin about any possible changes in Beijing's policy. Western leaders
have accused China of providing Russia with essential weapons components
and working to conceal it. The F.S.B. document lends support to that
claim, stating that Beijing had proposed establishing supply chains to
Moscow that circumvent Western sanctions and had offered to participate
in the production of drones and other unspecified high-tech military
equipment. The document does not say whether those proposals were
carried out, though China has supplied Russia with drones. The F.S.B.
memo also hints at Chinese interest in the Wagner mercenary group, a
Russia-backed paramilitary group that propped up governments in Africa
for years and fought alongside Russian troops in Ukraine. "The Chinese
plan to use the experience of Wagner fighters in their own armed forces
and private military companies operating in the countries of Southeast
Asia, Africa and Latin America," the directive says. The wording of the
report does not indicate whether the F.S.B. believes that China wants to
recruit former Wagner fighters for its own formations or simply wants to
learn from their experience. [[Russia has long feared encroachment by
China]{.mark} along their shared]{.underline} 2,615-mile
[border]{.underline}. And Chinese nationalists for years have taken
issue with 19th-century treaties in which Russia annexed large portions
of land, including modern-day Vladivostok. [[That issue is now of key
concern]{.underline}]{.mark}, [with Russia weakened by the war and
economic sanctions and less able than ever to push back against
Beijing.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} F.S.B. [report raises concerns
that some academics in China have been promoting territorial claims
against Russia.]{.underline} China is searching for traces of "ancient
Chinese peoples" in the Russian Far East, possibly to influence local
opinion that is favorable to Chinese claims, the document says. In 2023,
China published an official map that included historical Chinese names
for cities and areas within Russia. The F.S.B. ordered officers to
expose such "revanchist" activities, as well as attempts by China to use
Russian scientists and archival funds for research aimed at attaching a
historical affiliation to borderlands. "Conduct preventative work with
respect to Russian citizens involved in the said activities," the memo
orders. "Restrict entry into our country for foreigners as a measure of
influence." [The concerns about China expanding its reach are not
limited to Russia's Far East borderlands]{.underline}. Central Asian
countries answered to Moscow during the Soviet era. Today, the F.S.B.
reports, Beijing has developed a "new strategy" to promote Chinese soft
power in the region. China began rolling out that strategy in
Uzbekistan, according to the document. The details of the strategy are
not included in the document other than to say it involves humanitarian
exchange. Uzbekistan and neighboring countries are important to Mr.
Putin, who sees restoring the Soviet sphere of influence as part of his
legacy. [[The report also highlights China's interest in Russia's vast
territory in the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}]{.mark},
which hugs Russia's northern coast. Historically, those waters have been
too icy for reliable shipping, but they are expected become increasingly
busy because of climate change. The route slashes shipping time between
Asia and Europe. Developing that route would make it easier for China to
sell its goods. [[Russia historically tried to maintain strict control
over Chinese activity in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. But Beijing
believes that Western sanctions will force Russia to turn to China to
maintain its "aging Arctic infrastructure," according to the F.S.B.
document. Already, the Russian gas giant Novatek has relied on China to
salvage its Arctic liquefied natural gas project, after previously using
the American oil services firm Baker Hughes. [The F.S.B. asserts that
Chinese spies are active in the Arctic]{.underline}, as well. [The
report says Chinese intelligence is trying to obtain information about
Russia's development of the Arctic,]{.underline} using institutions of
higher education and mining companies in particular. But despite all of
these vulnerabilities, the F.S.B. report makes clear that jeopardizing
the support of China would be worse. The document squarely warns
officers that they must receive approval from the highest echelons of
the Russian security establishment before taking any sensitive action at
all.

#### Incompatible strategic cultures limit Russian-Chinese Cooperation in the Arctic -- long-term power dynamics thump short-term cooperation

Jørgen **Staun** **and** Camilla T. N. **Sørensen**, **2023**,
Scandinavian Journal of Military Studies, 6(1), 24-39, "Incompatible
Strategic Cultures Limit Russian-Chinese Strategic Cooperation in the
Arctic," https://sjms.nu/articles/10.31374/sjms.178, mm

[While they share the overall focus on confronting]{.underline} what
both Moscow and Beijing see as [a hostile]{.underline} and threatening
[U.S.,]{.underline} [[Russia and China have conflicting ends]{.mark}
when it comes to their views on their respective roles in the future
international system. Russia wants to be a leading great
power]{.underline} but realize that role will become increasingly
difficult if the world moves towards a bipolar standoff between China
and the U.S. [[Even if China officially adheres to
multipolarity]{.underline}, [it]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly
measures and [[positions itself solely in relation to the
U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}. [China]{.underline} thus [assesses its
strategic cooperation with Russia in terms of the benefits this
cooperation brings in China's confrontation with the U.S]{.underline}.
[[As the power asymmetry continues to grow to China's advantage]{.mark},
[it is highly likely that a more confident Beijing will]{.mark}
increasingly [feel entitled to set the tone]{.mark} in the strategic
partnership with Russia and will push for emphasis on Chinese concepts
and ideas]{.underline} -- on the development of the future international
order, for example. We are already seeing strong signs of this, most
recently in the 2022 Joint Statement, in which Beijing expressed support
for the Russian critique of NATO enlargement for the first time. When it
came to describing the preferred international development, however,
Chinese concepts and ideas were clearly dominant (President of Russia,
2022). [To leave the dominant role and the initiative to China does not
come easily for Russia, being incompatible with Russian great power
identity. The Russian reservation shines through in some of the
formulations of its official statements:]{.underline} The Russian side
notes the significance of the concept of constructing a "community of
common destiny for mankind" proposed by the Chinese side to ensure
greater solidarity of the international community and consolidation of
efforts in responding to common challenges (President of Russia, 2022).
According to Lukin (2021, p. 166), [Beijing's intensified effort to push
Chinese concepts and official statements on various issues and thus to
shape the narrative of joint declarations and treaties provokes a
growing discontent in Russia]{.underline}. As seen in the 2022 Joint
Statement, Russia has accepted the Chinese concept of "community of
common destiny" as well as "the new era of Sino-Russian relations" --
but not without internal dissent (see Denisov & Lukin, 2021, pp.
545--546). Such [[internal dissent in Russia is likely to grow]{.mark}
with the increase in Chinese confidence and assertiveness]{.underline}.
[As China develops its goal of becoming a world class military power and
a maritime great power, Russia's deeply ingrained insecurity and feeling
of vulnerability will also grow]{.underline}. As demonstrated above,
[**[it will be particularly so in the Arctic]{.mark}**, [given that
Russia's great power identity is closely connected to the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Moscow will]{.mark} therefore [find it
extremely difficult to]{.mark} make room for and to [accommodate
China]{.mark} as the leading great power there.]{.underline} In other
words: [while Russia and China have expanded their strategic cooperation
in the Arctic in recent years, **[there are serious stumbling blocks to
further expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Russia wants to retain its
position as the leading power in the Arctic and to preserve the
privileges of the Arctic states in relation to Arctic governance. Such
ends will increasingly be challenged by a more assertive
China]{.underline} insisting on being respected and included in the
region as a great power, and on gaining a decisive role and influence on
the region's governance regime. As mentioned above, China shows a
preference for non-Arctic specific agreements and regulations, which
until now has been met with strong resistance in Russia. Here it is
worth noting the statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry's Special
Envoy to the Arctic, Nikolay Korchunov that it is impossible to disagree
with U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo's statement made in May 2019
that there are two groups of countries --- Arctic and non-Arctic ... He
said so in relation to China, which positioned itself as a near-Arctic
state. We disagree with this (quoted in Wishnick, 2021) In this one
sentence, Korchunov says that China, in Russia's view, is not an Arctic
state and therefore should not enjoy comparable rights. Arctic
governance, in other words, is for Arctic states. It should be
remembered that Russia initially opposed China's observer status in the
Arctic Council until China agreed to recognize the privileges and rights
of the Arctic states (Wishnick, 2020, p. 6). However, Beijing has since
gradually moved and is increasingly challenging Russia's -- and the
other Arctic states' -- position in line with its overall ambition of
becoming "rule-maker" instead of "rule-taker". Increasing Chinese
lawfare activities, especially, are to meet strong resistance in Russia.
[[Seen from Moscow, it is crucial to maintain and demonstrate Russian
sovereignty in the Russian Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moscow, in other
words, will not allow serious questions or challenges to its economic
sovereignty or to its security, its military dominance, in the Russian
Arctic. Such challenges are not unthinkable, however, should the Chinese
military, through dual-use activities and facilities, increase its
presence in the region, or if Chinese companies (large state-owned
shipping, infrastructure construction or resource-extraction companies,
for example) or banks gain a dominant stake in projects in the Russian
Arctic. Indeed, following Western sanctions associated with the war in
Ukraine, such scenarios have become more likely. It is not only a
question of the Russian side losing control over the projects and
missing out on actual profit or other material gains, but also the
potential for the area to be decreasingly recognized as Russian
territory, a vital constituent of the Russian sphere of influence and,
hence, a pillar of Russian great power status[. If Moscow is no longer
able to uphold the picture of Russia as the Arctic great power, it will
cost it the recognition and respect more generally of it being a great
powe]{.underline}r. Consequently, [it is likely that Russia and
China]{.underline}, [sharing complementary interests and a perception of
a hostile U.S., should remain committed to further developing their
strategic cooperation in the Arctic in the near term]{.underline}. They
will thus seek to manage the sources of concern and tension. And due to
its dire economic position as a consequence of the war in Ukraine,
Russia will most likely be able and willing to accept more than it
otherwise would. We may be partly seeing the framework for this being
set in the new Foreign Policy Concept from 2023, where it is stated that
Russia in the Arctic will give priority to "establishing mutually
beneficial cooperation with non-Arctic states pursuing a constructive
policy towards Russia and interested in carrying out international
activities in the Arctic, including the infrastructural development of
the Northern Sea Route" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2023). In our
view, this is mainly addressed to China. Taken together with Russia's
new borne reservations vis-à-vis the Arctic Council and other
multilateral Arctic fora and prioritisation of "relations with foreign
states on a bilateral basis", as stated in the amendments to its 2020
Arctic strategy (2023), it points towards more Russian-Chinese
cooperation in the Arctic in the near future and possibly also further
alignment of Russian interests with Chinese wishes. [In the long run,
however]{.underline}, **[we argue that [widespread accommodation to
China is not sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[as Russia will not
accept its relatively declining position]{.mark} and excessive
dependence on China]{.underline}. [Besides being incompatible with the
Russian great power identity,]{.underline} with [time it will also come
to restrict Russia's policy options and force unwelcomed
concessions]{.underline}. [[The Chinese side]{.mark},]{.underline}
employing its ways and means more assertively, [[will come to be less
diligent in its reassurances]{.mark} and respect concerning Russia's
need for great power recognition.]{.underline}

[The world is separating into a NATO+ grouping]{.underline} of NATO
countries and Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, under
clear US leadership, [and the Rest]{.underline}. [The Rest]{.underline},
I call BRICS++ for the BRICS+ grouping and many other countries. This
separation is clear through demography, economy, and science and
technology. Humanity [is about 8 billion people, compared to the West,
which is about 1 billion, making it a small minority]{.underline}.
Humanity is expected to grow to 10 billion, where the West will remain
at about 1 billion, a shrinking small minority. The dominance of the
West has rested on economic development and science and technology,
translated into military force, with a shrinking demographic share of
the world economy, scientific and technological development and relative
power shifts from the West to the Rest. [Legitimacy and credibility
divisions are also clearly visible between the NATO+ and the BRICS++
worlds]{.underline} concerning the war in Ukraine, where the West is
astonished by its own isolation. To great surprise, [the Rest of the
world have not followed the West's attempts to isolate Russia
diplomatically and economically]{.underline}. This rejection of the
West's position was clear from the very first UN Security Council debate
on the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Russian veto and
Chinese and Indian abstentions were not surprising, but the abstention
by the United Arab Emirates was remarkable considering the close
security and other partnerships between the GCC countries and the US and
historically the UK. The speech during the debate on 21 February 2022, a
few days prior, by the Kenyan ambassador to the Security Council,
condemning Russia's recognition of breakaway regions but reminding that
other UNSC permanent members had also violated international law, showed
the lack of Western credibility and legitimacy on the issue. Western
credibility and legitimacy have eroded further by supporting Israel's
genocide in Gaza since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. [The
effects of world order on the Arctic are clear]{.underline}, applying
the analytical lenses of unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar traits of
world order to the Arctic. [The world is increasingly becoming
Sino-American bipolar, where the US seeks to maintain unipolarity
through a global containment strategy of China.]{.underline} This
struggle is also evident in the Arctic; for instance, US pressure on the
Kingdom of Denmark to exclude Chinese investment, science and technology
in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The US keeps up an ever-stronger
anti-Chinese Arctic discourse from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's 2019
speech in Rovaniemi, Finland, to US Senator Lisa Murkowski at the Arctic
Circle Assembly in Reykjavik in 2024. [Russia has opposed US unipolarity
since the 1990s]{.underline}, seeking multipolarity. The conflict
between US and Russian multipolarity ultimately escalated via the 2014
annexation of Crimea, the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the proxy war in
Ukraine. This conflict has led to an almost complete division of the
Arctic into NATO-Arctic (collaborating with the wider NATO+ world and
further) and the Russian Arctic. Russia reaches out all it can
diplomatically, economically, and in science and technology to the
BRICS++ world, especially China and India. The Rest of the World seems
restrained from pursuing Russian Arctic opportunities by the risk of US
and Western secondary sanctions and other NATO Arctic pushbacks. [The
world is]{.underline}---as usual for international history---[marked by
the struggle over the world order among the strongest State
actors]{.underline}. This struggle was forgotten especially by European
observers during the post-Cold War era, with the illusion of End of
History and confounding globalization and modernization with
Westernization. Instead, we have had the Return of History and the
return of historically very large non-Western economic, science and
technology actors as China, followed by others. [The current
struggle]{.underline} over the world order [also shapes the
Arctic,]{.underline} as was historically clear, especially during the
Second World War and the Cold War. [The US is determined to prolong
post-Cold War unipolar dominance expressed as 'rules-based
order']{.underline}, where the US defines the rules, to whom, and when
they apply. Europe has found an apparently comfortable and completely
dependent position in this US-led order. [The Rest of the World less so,
with China and Russia explicitly rejecting this US-led
orde]{.underline}r. [The conflict]{.underline} over world order between
the US and its bounded order in the NATO+ world in Europe, Oceania, and
East Asia and the Rest of the World, [can only be expected to
escalate]{.underline}. The US must either stop Chinese economic, science
and technology development (and later other peer competitors), or
[demographics, economy, science and technology will lead to a more
bipolar and multipolar world]{.underline}. Europe by its dependence on
the US is forced to follow this US strategy. [The war in Ukraine can
lead to a frozen conflict, where the overall Russia-West relationship
remains highly conflictual, including in the Arctic]{.underline}.
Ukrainian defeat or a negotiated settlement with a neutralized Ukraine
and cessation of territory to Russia will also probably lead to a
decadal severance of economic, science and technology, people-to-people
ties between Russia and the West, including in the Arctic. [A Russian
defeat is unlikely]{.underline} because of difference in Russian and
Ukrainian manpower and resources. [China is unlikely to allow Russia to
succumb to the US,]{.underline} which would put defeated Russia on
China's Northern frontier in China's own conflict with the US. [All in
all, world order seems highly conflictual and with increased separation
between the NATO+ and the BRICS++ world]{.underline}, which will only
bring humanity more conflict and less economic development and growth,
unlike the age of post-Cold War globalization. [This division will be
replicated in the Arctic]{.underline}.

Complacency, Appeasement, Self-destruction, and the New Cold War

It could be argued that the policies proposed here to deal with the
international problems, whether real or imagined, presented by China,
Russia, and Iran constitute exercises not only in complacency, but also
in appeasement. That argument would be correct. As discussed in the
Prologue to this book, [[appeasement]{.mark} can]{.underline}
**[work]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[[avoid military
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as]{.underline} can be [seen in the
case of the]{.underline} **[Cuban missile crisis]{.underline}** of 1962.
As also discussed there, [appeasement has been]{.underline} **[given a
bad name]{.underline}** by the experience with Hitler in 1938.

Hitlers are very rare, but [there are]{.underline} some
**[resonances]{.underline}** today [in]{.underline}
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Vladimir Putin [[and
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark}'s Xi Jinping. [Both are]{.underline}
shrewd, **[determined]{.underline}**, [**authoritarian**,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} seem to be quite intelligent, [and]{.underline} both
[are]{.underline} **[fully in charge]{.underline}**, are surrounded by
sychophants, [and]{.underline} [appear to have essentially]{.underline}
**[unlimited tenure]{.underline}** [in office]{.underline}. Moreover,
both, like Hitler in the 1930s, are appreciated domestically for
maintaining a stable political and economic environment. However, unlike
Hitler, [both [run **trading states** and need a **stable
and**]{.mark}]{.underline} essentially **[[congenial international
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to flourish]{.underline}.128 Most
importantly, except for China's claim to Taiwan, [[neither]{.mark} seems
to [harbor]{.mark}]{.underline} Hitler-like [[dreams of]{.mark}
**extensive**]{.underline} [[expansion by]{.mark} [military]{.mark}
means]{.underline}. Both are [leading their countries in an]{.underline}
**[illiberal direction]{.underline}** which [will]{.underline} **[hamper
economic growth]{.underline}** [while maintaining a kleptocratic
system]{.underline}. But this may be acceptable to populations enjoying
historically high living standards and fearful of less stable
alternatives. [Both]{.underline} do seem to [want to]{.underline}
**[overcome]{.underline}** what they view as [past
humiliations]{.underline} -- ones going back to the opium war of 1839 in
the case of China and to the collapse of the Soviet empire and then of
the Soviet Union in 1989--91 in the case of Russia. Primarily, both seem
to want to be treated with respect and deference. Unlike Hitler's
Germany, however, [both seem to be]{.underline} **[entirely
appeasable]{.underline}**. [That]{.underline}
[**[scarcely]{.underline}** [seems]{.underline}]{.mark} [to present or
represent [a threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [United
States]{.underline}, after all, **[continually]{.underline}** [declares
itself]{.underline} [to be]{.underline} the
**[indispensable]{.underline}** nation. [If the United States is allowed
to wallow]{.underline} in such self-important, childish, essentially
meaningless, and decidedly fatuous proclamations, [why]{.underline}
[should]{.underline} **[other nations]{.underline}** [be denied the
opportunity to emit]{.underline} **[similar inconsequential
rattlings]{.underline}**? If that constitutes appeasement, so be it.
[[If]{.mark} the two [countries want]{.mark} to]{.underline} be able to
say they now [preside over [a "**sphere of influence**," it scarcely
seems]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[worth risking world
war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to]{.underline} somehow [keep them from
doing so -- and [if the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[substantially
disarmed]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [it would not have the]{.underline}
**[capacity]{.underline}** [to even try]{.underline}.

If China and Russia get off on self-absorbed pretensions about being big
players, that should be of little concern -- and [their]{.underline}
**[success rate]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}** [to be any better than that]{.underline} of
[the United States]{.underline}. Charap and Colton observe that "The
Kremlin's idee fixe that Russia needs to be the leader of a pack of

Applying the Gingrich gospel, then, [it]{.underline}
**[certainly]{.underline}** [seems that, [although]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[China]{.underline}**, **[Russia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark} [may [present]{.mark} some
"[challenges]{.mark}"]{.underline} to US policy, [there is]{.underline}
**[little or nothing]{.underline}** [to suggest]{.underline} a need to
maintain a [large US military force]{.underline}-in-being [to
keep]{.underline} these [countries in line]{.underline}. Indeed,
[[all]{.mark} three]{.underline} monsters [[seem]{.mark} to be
[in]{.mark} some stage of]{.underline}
**[self-destruction]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[descent into
[stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- not, perhaps, unlike the Communist
"threat" during the Cold War. Complacency thus seems to be a viable
policy.

However, it may be useful to [look]{.underline}
**[specifically]{.underline}** [at a couple of [worst-case]{.mark}
scenarios]{.underline}: an **[[invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan]{.underline}**
[by China]{.underline} (after it builds up its navy more) [and
an]{.underline} **[invasion of the Baltic states]{.underline}** of
Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia [by Russia]{.underline}. [It
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[wildly [unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
[[China or Russia]{.mark} would [carry out]{.mark} such]{.underline}
**[[economically self-destructive acts]{.underline}]{.mark}**: the
[economic]{.underline} [[lessons]{.underline}]{.mark} from Putin's
comparatively minor Ukraine gambit [[are]{.underline}
**[clear]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} these are
**[unlikely]{.underline}** [to be lost on the Chinese]{.underline}.
Moreover, the analyses of Michael **[Beckley]{.underline}**
[certainly]{.underline} [suggest]{.underline} that [Taiwan has the
conventional military]{.underline} **[capacity]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} concentrate the mind of, if not necessarily fully to
**[deter, any Chinese attackers]{.underline}**. [It has
"spent]{.underline} **[decades]{.underline}** [preparing for this exact
contingency]{.underline}," has an advanced early warning system, can
call into action massed forces to defend "fortified positions on home
soil with precision-guided munitions," and has supply dumps, booby
traps, an wide array of mobile missile launchers, artillery, and
minelayers. In addition, there are [only]{.underline} **[14
locations]{.underline}** that [can support]{.underline} amphibious
[landing and]{.underline} these [are]{.underline}, not surprisingly,
**[well-fortified by the defenders]{.underline}**.130

The United States may not necessarily be able to deter or stop military
attacks on Taiwan or on the Baltics under its current force levels.131
And if it cannot credibly do so with military forces currently in being,
it would not be able to do so, obviously, if its forces were much
reduced. However, [the]{.underline} **[most likely
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}** in either eventuality [[would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the United States to wage [a]{.mark}
campaign of]{.underline} **[[economic and
military]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including naval)
[[harassment]{.underline}]{.mark} and to support local -- or partisan --
resistance as it did in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion there in
1979. 132 [Such a response]{.underline} [**[does not]{.underline}**
[require]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States to have, and perpetually
to maintain, [huge [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} in place and [[at the
ready]{.underline}]{.mark} to deal with such improbable eventualities.

The [current]{.underline} **[wariness]{.underline}** about,
[and]{.underline} **[hostility]{.underline}** [toward, Russia and China
is]{.underline} sometimes [said to constitute "a new Cold
War."]{.underline}133 There are, of course, considerable differences. In
particular, during the Cold War, the Soviet Union -- indeed the whole
international Communist movement -- was under the sway of a Marxist
theory that explicitly and determinedly advocated the destruction of
capitalism and probably of democracy, and by violence to the degree
required. [[Neither]{.underline} **[Russia nor
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} today [[sport]{.mark}s such]{.underline}
**[[cosmic goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or is enamored of]{.underline}
such **[destructive]{.underline}** [methods]{.underline}. However, as
discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
was]{.underline} **[strongly]{.underline}** [inclined]{.underline}
during the Cold War massively [to]{.underline} **[[inflate the
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [it imagined]{.underline} the
Communist adversary to present. The current "new Cold War" is thus in an
important respect quite a bit like the old one: [it is
[an]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
substantially **[militarized]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
often [**[hysterical]{.underline}** [campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
deal with threats that do not exist]{.underline} or are likely to
selfdestruct.134

It may also be useful to evaluate terms that are often bandied about in
considerations within foreign policy circles about the rise of China,
the assertiveness of Russia, and the antics of Iran. High among these is
"hegemony." Sorting through various definitions, Simon Reich and Richard
Ned Lebow array several that seem to capture the essence of the concept:
domination, controlling leadership, or the ability to shape
international rules according to the hegemon's own interests. Hegemony,
then, is an extreme word suggesting supremacy, mastery, preponderant
influence, and full control. Hegemons force others to bend to their will
whether they like it or not. Reich and Lebow also include a mellower
designation applied by John Ikenberry and Charles Kupchan in which a
hegemon is defined as an entity that has the ability to establish a set
of norms that others willingly embrace.135 But this really seems to
constitute an extreme watering-down of the word and suggests opinion
leadership or entrepreneurship and success at persuasion, not hegemony.

Moreover, insofar as they carry meaning, the militarized application of
American primacy and hegemony to order the world has often been a
fiasco.136 Indeed, it is impressive that the hegemon, endowed by
definition by what Reich and Lebow aptly call a grossly disproportionate
military capacity, has had such a miserable record of military
achievement since 1945 -- an issue discussed frequently in this book.137
Reich and Lebow argue that it is incumbent on IR scholars to cut
themselves loose from the concept of hegemony.138 It seems even more
important for the foreign policy establishment to do so.

[There is]{.underline} also **[[absurdity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
getting up tight [over something as]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[vacuous
as]{.mark} the venerable "[s]{.mark}phere [o]{.mark}f
[i]{.mark}nfluence" concept]{.underline}** (or conceit). The [notion
that world affairs]{.underline} [are a process in which
countries]{.underline} **[scamper]{.underline}** around the world
[seeking to establish spheres]{.underline} [of influence is]{.underline}
[at]{.mark} best decidedly unhelpful and at worst **[utterly
[misguided]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But the concept continues to be
embraced in some quarters as if it had some palpable meaning. For
example, in early 2017, the august National Intelligence Council opined
that "Geopolitical competition is on the rise as China and Russia seek
to exert more sway over their neighboring regions and promote an order
in which US influence does not dominate."139 [Setting aside
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[issue of]{.mark} the
[degree]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to which American "influence"
[could]{.mark} be said to "**[dominate]{.mark}**"]{.underline} anywhere
([we still wait]{.underline}, for example, [for]{.underline}
**[dominated Mexico]{.underline}** supinely [to pay for a
wall]{.underline} to seal off its self-infatuated neighbor's southern
border), [[it]{.underline} **[doesn't]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[bloody
well [matter]{.mark}]{.underline}** whether China or Russia has, or
seems to have, a "sphere of influence" someplace or other.

More importantly, the whole notion is vapid and essentially meaningless.
Except perhaps in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe. When members of the
House of Lords fail to pay sufficient respect to a group of women they
take to be members of a ladies' seminary who are actually fairies, their
queen, outraged at the Lords' collected effrontery, steps forward,
proclaims that she happens to be an "influential fairy," and then, with
a few passes of her wand, brushes past the Lords' pleas ("no!" "mercy!"
"spare us!" and "horror!"), and summarily issues several edicts: a young
man of her acquaintance shall be inducted into their House, every bill
that gratifies his pleasure shall be passed, members shall be required
to sit through the grouse and salmon season, and high office shall be
obtainable by competitive examination. Now, that's influence. In
contrast, on December 21, 2017, when the United States sought to alter
the status of Jerusalem, the United Nations General Assembly voted to
repudiate the US stand in a nearly unanimous vote that included many US
allies. Now, that's not influence.

In fact, [to push this point]{.underline} perhaps **[to an
extreme]{.underline}**, [[if]{.mark} we are entering an era in
which]{.underline} **[[economic]{.mark}
motivation[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[became]{.underline}
**[paramount]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} in which [military
force is]{.underline} **[not deemed a sensible method]{.underline}** for
pursuing wealth, [the]{.underline} **[idea of
"[influence"]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[would be]{.mark}come
[obsolete]{.mark}]{.underline} [because]{.underline}, in principle,
[pure economic actors do not care]{.underline} much about influence.
They care about getting rich. (As Japan and Germany have found, however,
influence, status, and prestige tend to accompany the accumulation of
wealth, but this is just an ancillary effect.) Suppose the president of
a company could choose between two stories to tell the stockholders. One
message would be, "We enjoy great influence in the industry. When we
talk everybody listens. Our profits are nil." The other would be, "No
one in the industry pays the slightest attention to us or ever asks our
advice. We are, in fact, the butt of jokes in the trade. We are making
money hand over fist." There is no doubt about which story would most
thoroughly warm the stockholders' hearts.

Science and Chair of the Committee on International Relations at the
University of Chicago; Lawfare, "Misreading the 'Liberal Order:' Why We
Need New Thinking in American Foreign Policy,"
https://www.lawfareblog.com/misreading-liberal-order-why-we-need-new-thinking-american-foreign-policy\]

[**Pushing back** against Trump's foreign policy is an **important
goal**.]{.underline} But [moving forward requires a **more serious
analysis** than claiming that [the "**liberal international order**"
was]{.mark}]{.underline} the centerpiece of past U.S. foreign-policy
successes, and thus should be again. Both claims are flawed. We need to
understand the limits of the liberal international order, where it
previously failed to deliver benefits, and why it offers little guidance
for many contemporary questions.

First, advocates of the order tend to skim past the policies pursued
under the liberal order that have not worked. These mistakes need to be
directly confronted to do better in the future.

Proponents of the order, however, often present a narrow and highly
selective reading of history that ignores much of the coercion,
violence, and instability that accompanied post-war history. Problematic
outcomes are treated as either aberrant exceptions or as not truly
characterizing the order. One recent defense of the liberal order by
prominent liberal institutionalists Daniel Deudney and G. John
Ikenberry, for instance, does not mention Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, or
Libya. Professors Stephen Chaudoin, Helen Milner, and Dustin Tingley
herald the order's "support for freedom, democracy, human rights, a free
press." Kori Schake writes that Western democracies' wars are "about
enlarging the perimeter of security and prosperity, expanding and
consolidating the liberal order." Historian Hal Brands argues that the
order has advocated "political liberalism in the form of representative
government and human rights; and other liberal concepts, such as
nonaggression, self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of
disputes."

Other analysts have persuasively argued that these accounts create an
"imagined" picture of post-World War II history. Patrick Porter outlines
in detail how coercive, violent, and hypocritical U.S. foreign policy
has often been. To the extent an international liberal order ever
actually existed beyond a small cluster of countries, writes Nick
Danforth, it was recent and short-lived. Thomas Meaney and Stephen
Wertheim further argue that "critics exaggerate Mr. Trump's
abnormality," situating him within a long history of the pursuit of
American self-interest. Graham Allison---no bomb-throwing radical---has
recently written that the order [[was a **"myth"**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and that [[**credit** for]{.mark} the [**lack of great power war**
**should instead go to nuclear deterrence**]{.mark}. **Coercion** and
**disregard** for]{.underline} both [**allies** and **political
liberalism** have been **entirely compatible** with the "**liberal**"
**order**.]{.underline}

The last two decades have been a bumpy ride for U.S. foreign policy.
Since 9/11, we have seen the disintegration of Syria, Yemen, and Libya,
a war without end in Afghanistan, the collapse of the Arab Spring, the
rise and resurgence of the Islamic State, and the distinctly mixed
success of strategies aimed at managing China's rise. At home, the
growth of a national-security state has placed remarkable power in the
hands of Donald Trump. Simply returning to the old order is no guarantee
of good results. Grappling openly with failure and self-inflicted
wounds---while also acknowledging clear benefits of the order---is
essential for moving beyond self-congratulatory platitudes.

Second, [[the]{.mark} liberal [order]{.mark}]{.underline} in its
idealized form [[had **very limited reach** into]{.mark} what are now
**pivotal areas of U.S. security policy**: **[Asia]{.mark}**, the
[**Middle East**, and]{.mark} the **["developing
world"]{.mark}**]{.underline} more broadly. The core of the liberal
order remains transatlantic, but Asia is now growing dramatically in
wealth and military power. What is the record of the order in the
region? There was certainly some democracy promotion when authoritarian
regimes began to totter, but there was also deep, sustained cooperation
with dictators like Suharto and Ferdinand Marcos; while there are some
regional institutions (such as ASEAN), they are comparatively weak;
while there are some rules, they have been deeply contested. Close U.S.
allies like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea (the latter two experiencing
long bouts of U.S.-allied autocracy) were not integrated into a broad
alliance pact like NATO. India and Pakistan were never part of the core
order, and China was only very partially integrated (primarily into the
economic pillar of the order, and through ad hoc security cooperation
from the 1970s). Southeast Asia has been a site of warfare and
authoritarianism for much of its post-1945 history.

The United States has long considered the Middle East vital to its
security, but the extent to which the United States should invest its
own blood and treasure in protecting the area was always up for debate.
It was only in the 1970s that the United States decided it was prepared
to use force to defend the region; "dual containment" in the 1990s was
always controversial, while [the invasion of **Iraq** and its **chaotic
aftermath** revealed **deep fissures** over how much presence was
**enough**. Meanwhile, **liberalism, democracy, human rights**, and
**international institutions** have **not made much of a mark** in the
region]{.underline}. Jake Sullivan, in a rather odd defense of the
order, suggests that "[Middle Eastern instability has been a
**feature**, not a **bug**, of the system]{.underline}." [This is **not
reassuring** about the order's ability to **structure politics** in the
area]{.underline}. [[The same]{.mark} can be said
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} the order's history in
**[[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [with deep Western
involvement]{.underline} in civil wars, support for authoritarian
regimes, and often-counterproductive demands for economic liberalization
contributing to ongoing instability.

The legacy of the "liberal order" is both far more complex and shallower
outside of the north Atlantic core than within it. Invocations of the
order are seen with greater cynicism and suspicion in these areas than
in Washington or Berlin. Yet they are precisely the regions that are
increasingly the focus of U.S. security policy.

Finally, and as the preceding already suggests, [the idea
of]{.underline} "**[liberal order]{.underline}**" [is itself frequently
**[too vague]{.mark} a concept**, and was too **incomplete a
phenomenon**]{.underline}, [to offer guidance on a number of key
contemporary questions]{.underline}. [Allison]{.underline} goes so far
as to [call it **["conceptual Jell-o."]{.mark}**]{.underline} [The
**extremely abstract principles** that experts use to define the order
are **confronted** with a reality of **extreme historical variation**.
[This]{.mark} amorphousness **[undermines]{.mark} its
[usefulness]{.mark}** [as a]{.mark}n **actual [guide to]{.mark} future
[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy**.]{.underline}

U.S. [alliances in]{.underline} Western [Europe]{.underline} since World
War II [look]{.underline}ed [**dramatically different** than those in
East Asia]{.underline}. Both have achieved their basic goals, so which
should be the model for the future? The United States often applied
pressure to coerce its allies into adopting economic and security
policies conducive to U.S. interests---going so far as to threaten
abandonment of close European allies---even as it simultaneously built
key elements of the liberal order. [[The core]{.mark} of the liberal
order [was]{.mark} a more [**tenuous** and **contested**]{.mark}
political space than we often remember.]{.underline}

This inconsistency applies to involvement in the domestic politics of
other states. [The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates has
**[regularly embraced authoritarian leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([and
distanced itself from **democratic regimes**]{.underline}), [while at
other times it has helped to **push these leaders** **out** in the face
of domestic mobilization]{.underline}. Advocates of the order tend to
stress the latter and dismiss the former as aberrant, but both
strategies contributed to the ultimate victory of the liberal order over
the Soviet bloc.

The order's history offers support for aggressively promoting democracy,
accepting democratization when it emerges, and strongly supporting
friendly dictators. [This makes it **unhelpful** for grappling with the
question of **whether**]{.underline} and how [**to promote
democracy**.]{.underline} The same is true of military interventions and
covert operations abroad. U.S. leaders invested heavily in Cold War
proxy wars and the overthrow of foreign regimes, while at other times
and places they avoided such interventions.

This history carries important implications for addressing today's
policy challenges. Simply appealing to the order does not, for instance,
tell us much about how to deal with a rising China: Since [the liberal
order]{.underline} included highly institutionalized alliances, loose
"hub-and-spoke" arrangements, and coalitions of the willing, and [was
characterized by both **preventive wars** and
**containment**,]{.underline} it is extremely unclear what the order
suggests for America's China strategy. While "rules-based" order is a
term in vogue, it doesn't tell us what the rules should actually be, or
how they should be decided.

Nor does appealing to the liberal order help us understand whether the
United States needs to be deeply involved or largely absent from the
Middle East, or somewhere in between. [**Under the order**, **[democracy
promotion]{.mark}** and **assertive liberal intervention** sometimes
[occurred, but so too did]{.mark} **restraint** and an **[acceptance of
autocracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are no answers in the liberal
international order for navigating the enormously difficult terrain of
the contemporary Middle East.

desirable,"

[While solar radiation modification]{.underline} (SRM) [is mostly
imagined as a global intervention, the Arctic has been singled out as a
region for deploying SRM]{.underline} with a more limited scope. But
[[in an increasingly]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic and [[conflictual
Arctic]{.mark} political climate, [SRM]{.mark} [would]{.mark} likely
[destabilise]{.mark} [things]{.mark} even [further]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Arctic SRM is therefore unlikely to succeed, and it is imprudent to
promote it if it distracts from the urgent need for mitigation and
adaptation. Many different ideas for SRM have been explored by
scientists and entrepreneurs as ways to stabilise or lower temperatures
in the Arctic, even as most research has been restricted to modelling
studies. Ideas include making marine clouds brighter,1 covering surfaces
with reflective materials,2 and thickening sea ice using wind-powered
water pumps.3 Not all such techniques are likely to be effective or
desirable from a technical perspective,4--6 and in January 2025 the
Arctic Ice Project -- which had proposed spreading small silica-based
beads to increase the reflectivity of ice -- was stopped, in part due to
concerns about the risk of toxic effects on the Arctic food chain. In
addition to such technical uncertainties, there is, however, an
additional element of political uncertainty which is too often
overlooked. In fact, those working on Arctic SRM projects tend to
believe that "Arctic interventions pose less of a governance challenge
than global climate interventions", as Daniel Bodansky and Hugh Hunt
argue.7 They highlight the existence of the Arctic Council as an
effective institution for getting countries to agree on Arctic SRM,
while others have emphasised the small number of countries that would
need to come to an agreement.8 But recent research, including recent
work by Olaf Corry, Duncan McLaren, and myself, raises serious doubts
about the Arctic as a politically conducive region for SRM.9 In our
paper,10 we analysed literature on Arctic SRM, looking into the
assumptions researchers and entrepreneurs had about Arctic politics. We
also asked how the Arctic climate was understood as a problem that could
potentially be addressed via SRM. We then compared and contrasted their
views with those expressed in recent policy documents of Arctic
states.11 Our research found that SRM scientists and entrepreneurs
understand the Arctic as an exceptional region in international
politics, where inter-state cooperation on environmental and scientific
agendas can be separated from international security and competitive
dynamics between states. This idea of "Arctic exceptionalism",12
famously encapsulated in Mikhail Gorbachev declaring the Arctic a "zone
of peace", was prevalent in the decades after the Cold War and led to
many successful examples of inter-state cooperation -- particularly
through the Arctic Council of states and Indigenous organisations.
However, recent political developments on the global stage have made
"Arctic exceptionalism" appear increasingly outdated. [The relationship
between the Arctic NATO states and Russia has soured]{.underline}
markedly [since]{.underline} [the]{.underline} Russian [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014. It further deteriorated with the
full-scale invasion in 2022, which caused NATO states to temporarily
suspend their participation in the Arctic Council. [[State
strategies]{.mark} for the Arctic increasingly [see it as]{.mark} having
[a high risk of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and there is a clear
trend toward more military presence in the Arctic]{.underline}.10 We
also found that [[mitigating climate change is not a major priority in
Arctic state policies]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Instead, [the
changing]{.mark} Arctic [climate]{.mark} [is]{.mark} largely
[seen]{.mark} as a new condition which must]{.underline} be adapted to
or even [seized upon [strategically]{.mark}]{.underline} as an
opportunity -- as illustrated by US President Trump's continued efforts
to gain control of Greenland. [The warmer climate makes the Arctic more
accessible]{.underline}, enabling new strategies for creating economic
growth from the region, for example through extraction of oil, gas, or
minerals; new transcontinental shipping routes; and tourism. [This
creates security risks and competition]{.underline} which states respond
to by increasing surveillance and military presence, which, in turn,
creates more mistrust of motives among the NATO states and Russia.10 [To
anticipate how Arctic SRM would unfold in reality, we must place it in
this broader geopolitical context]{.underline}. As my colleagues and I
found in a related interview study of security experts,13 security
actors and climate scientists don't make sense of SRM in the same way.
Scientists and engineers are predominantly concerned with technical
uncertainties and aggregate impacts as they can be measured with models
and experiments, bracketing out human motives and interpretations. By
contrast, diplomats, security analysts, and [[military actors]{.mark}
make sense of SRM through their pre-existing geopolitical
logics]{.underline}. This means, among other things, that [they think of
SRM]{.underline} first and foremost [as a strategic source of leverage
in global politics]{.underline}. [Rather than assuming it would be used
to mitigate climatic shifts in a rational way, they are concerned that
states [will not trust each other's intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}
around SRM research and deployment, [and that [the]{.mark} potential
[spread of disinformation]{.mark} about SRM [will]{.mark} [make]{.mark}
climate politics and international [cooperation]{.mark} more
[difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [if a state were to allow
[deployment]{.mark}]{.underline} or large-scale experiments [[with
SRM]{.mark} in the increasingly conflictual Arctic]{.underline}, [the
outcome would be]{.underline} unpredictable but likely
[destabilising]{.underline}. **[It [could trigger a diplomatic
crisis]{.mark}, potentially sabotaging other efforts to cooperate on
environmental policy and research.]{.underline}** [[States]{.mark}
[might]{.mark} also [consider]{.mark} their options for
"[counter-geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}",14 which would compound
the technical uncertainties of SRM. However, [anticipation of [such
dynamics]{.mark} [could]{.mark} also [make states prevent any
deployment]{.mark} or experiments **from getting off the ground [in the
first place]{.mark}**]{.underline}.13

#### Military involvement magnifies the turn -- ensures the disputes over geoengineering go nuclear

Alan **Robock**, June **2012**, \[Department of Environment Sciences,
Rutgers University\], Ethics, Policy and Environment, 15(2), "Will
Geoengineering With Solar Radiation Management Ever be Used?",
https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/WillGeoBeUsed.pdf, mm

As a meteorologist, I understand the limits of prediction of physical
systems, let alone human ones, but here I will attempt to predict
whether geoengineering will ever be used. While the term
'geoengineering' has come to encompass several different responses to
global warming, here I will use the term to refer to solar radiation
management, ideas about reducing incoming sunlight to cool the planet
(Lenton & Vaughan, 2009; Shepherd et al., 2009). [[The
geoengineering]{.mark} [ideas]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [have gotten the
most attention are]{.mark}]{.underline} the creation of a stratospheric
aerosol cloud, to mimic the effects of episodic volcanic eruptions, and
[the [brightening]{.mark} of low [clouds over the
ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}, to mimic ship tracks. No cloud has ever been
produced on purpose in the stratosphere, and no low cloud has ever been
brightened on purpose, and there are serious issues with the
practicality of either of these ideas, but for now I will assume that at
some time in the future they will become technically possible and
affordable. Still [I do not think either will ever be implemented on a
global basis, because of the inherent risks and
uncertainties]{.underline}. Geoengineering could reduce or reverse
global warming (Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2008). The impacts of rising
temperature on agriculture in general are negative. Pongratz, Lobell,
Cao and Caldeira (2012) showed that if the temperature did not rise in a
geoengineered world, enhanced CO2 would increase agricultural
productivity in general. Still, regional precipitation changes (droughts
and floods), as well as the continuing ocean acidification, argue
against a world with rising CO2 and the need to continue strengthening
geoengineering, with no end in sight. In addition, if society lost the
will or means to continue the geoengineering, the rapid warming that
would follow would be more dangerous than the gradual warming we are now
experiencing. One of the most serious possible side effects of a
stratospheric cloud is reduction of summer monsoon precipitation over
India and China (Robock et al., 2008). Similarly, marine cloud
brightening might devastate the Amazon (Jones, Haywood, & Boucher,
2009). But this precipitation reduction would be on a background of
large random interannual variations. For example, the summer monsoon in
India was below average in 2009 with drought, but was above average in
2010 with significant flooding. Due to this natural climate variability,
it is impossible to test whether stratospheric geoengineering would work
by using small stratospheric clouds, as the response to them would be
impossible to detect. In situ testing would essentially be full-scale
implementation (Robock, Bunzl, Kravitz, & Stenchikov, 2010).
MacMynowski, Keith, Caldeira and Shin (2011) propose periodic forcing of
the climate system to conduct in situ testing at less than the full
scale of implementation, but their proposal calls for [[large-scale
manipulation of the climate]{.mark} system]{.underline} for multiple
decades, which I think [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be]{.mark}
[found unacceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Long climate model simulations
can investigate the change in multi-decadal mean precipitation, but
those statistics will include large interannual variations.
[[Imagine]{.mark} that soon after implementation]{.underline} of
stratospheric geoengineering, [[India or China received]{.mark} two or
three years of [anomalous]{.mark} summer
[precipitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be impossible to attribute
those to the geoengineering, but certainly [[there would be]{.mark}
accusations that these actions were causing it and [demands for the
geoengineering to stop]{.mark}]{.underline}. What if computer modeling
determines that geoengineering overall would help the planet by reducing
the worst impacts of global warming, but that there would be regions
that would suffer at the same time? How would it be possible to
determine which adverse situations were caused by the geoengineering,
and which were just bad weather luck? Even if it were possible, how
could those suffering be compensated? There is not a good record of this
happening, even in cases where the cause is obvious. For example, are
people moved out of river valleys because of dam construction in general
happy with their new situations? How would the planetary governance
decision be made as to whether to implement geoengineering, and if so
how much? Whose hand would be on the planetary thermostat? Would the
decision process be the same successful model used to implement
mitigation of greenhouse gases emissions? I am participating in the
Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative, sponsored by the Royal
Society, and so far we have not even been able to agree on rules for in
situ testing of cloud brightening or stratospheric aerosols. For
example, some advocate a 'small-scale' test, one that would produce
important scientific information and pose no danger to the environment.
But how do you define 'small-scale'? What amount of material, over what
area, and for how long would emissions be acceptable? Is it acceptable
if emissions are less than other ongoing emissions, such as current
emissions from cargo ships? Or do two wrongs not make a right? Is it
acceptable if the impacts cannot be detected for some period after the
tests end, even if detection technology is imperfect, or the effects
might not appear until sometime later? [There are no rules, and
agreement does not seem near.]{.underline} Certainly, extensive computer
modeling of the processes being investigated and of the potential
consequences of both small-scale tests and geoengineering implementation
is needed. In my opinion, testing of geoengineering should be indoors
for the foreseeable future, either in computer models or laboratories,
with no potential to affect the environment. Only once we feel that we
have developed a good understanding of a potential system and have
devised an outdoor test that is crucial, should it go ahead, and then
only if it can be shown to be safe. I am not sure we will ever get to
that point. To help the progress of research on stratospheric
geoengineering, we have initiated the Geoengineering Model
Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) (Kravitz et al., 2011; Robock, Kravitz,
& Boucher, 2011). Climate modeling groups from around the world are
conducting standardized experiments of greenhouse gases and solar
reduction scenarios to examine the robustness of previous results of the
response of the hydrologic cycle to geoengineering, and will examine all
other climate responses. This will help us to better understand the
potential benefits and risks of such a strategy. The first results (for
example Schmidt et al., 2012) are now being published. In addition to
the above issues, there are more that would affect the implementation of
planetary geoengineering. The principle of informed consent governs
medical interventions. [How could we get the informed consent of the
entire planet?]{.underline} What if a big multinational corporation was
in charge? [[Would you trust the fate of the planet to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} BP Geoengineering Corporation? The [[US
military]{.underline}]{.mark} is the best at flying material up into the
atmosphere. [[Would the rest of the world trust
them]{.mark},]{.underline} or any military, to have their best interests
at heart? Certainly the developed world is most capable of doing any
geoengineering implementation. The history of colonialism will make the
rest of the world wary of climate manipulations that are presumably for
their benefit. Global agreement is not necessary for regional- or
global-scale geoengineering to be implemented. What if one country
determined that intervention would benefit them, say by relieving
drought caused by global warming, and their research showed that the
negative aspects elsewhere would be minimal? In this rather unlikely
event, and if the research proved correct, there may be no retribution.
Yet the creation of a stratospheric cloud in one location will allow the
cloud to spread globally if in the Tropics and covering half a
hemisphere in high latitudes, so it is bound to have large-scale
effects. Similarly, [[cloud brightening]{.mark} on a scale large enough
to change regional climate [will]{.mark} also [have effects in other
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And [it is highly]{.mark}
[unlikely]{.mark} that [the effects]{.mark} outside the target area
[will be]{.mark} only [positive]{.mark},]{.underline} or that it will be
possible to determine them amidst the weather noise. So here is my
prediction. Global warming will continue with only meager mitigation
actions for the next decade or two. Rich nations will work to adapt to
the continuing climate changes. Poor nations will continue to suffer out
of proportion. Weather catastrophes, such as strong hurricanes hitting
Guangzhou, China, or Washington, DC, USA, will get the world's attention
for a while, but there will still be arguments that individual events
cannot be tied to global warming. Ongoing geoengineering research using
computer models will identify clear risks of both cloud brightening and
stratospheric aerosol production, including ozone depletion and
reduction of water supplies to large natural areas, such as the Amazon,
and large regions that depend on water supplies for food production.
[Even suggestions of temporary geoengineering to relieve the most
dangerous aspects of global warming will be met with so many of the
above issues that there will never be world agreement to
implement]{.underline}. [[I can imagine worse scenarios]{.underline},
**[including global nuclear war started in response to unilateral
geoengineering implementation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. I can imagine
better scenarios, with technological breakthroughs of carbon-free energy
sources or charismatic world leaders taking us to a future using
existing technology with little additional dangerous climate change. I
can only hope that this latter scenario will play out.

### Unilateral Deployment Bad Turn -- Causes Conflict

#### Unilateral deployment of geoengineering fails -- generates international opposition 

Jennie **Stephens et al., 2023,** Environmental Politics, 32(1), "The
Dangers of Mainstreaming Solar Geoengineering: A critique of the
National Academies Report,"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2021.1989214#abstract,
mm

The report highlights the importance of inclusive global cooperation and
coordination, recognizing the dangers of a single country advancing
solar geoengineering research unilaterally. The report states that
'there are political risks associated with research, especially if
research is perceived as unilateral and self-interested based on actors'
past policy decisions' (NASEM 2021) (p. 112, italics added for
emphasis). Contrary to this cautionary note, however, the report
nonetheless unconditionally recommends immediate investment of up to
\$200 million U.S. dollars to establish a United States solar
geoengineering research program, even though a system of international
research governance has not yet been developed. [History shows that when
the U.S. takes the lead on international issues, international
governance institutions have been dominated by the U.S]{.underline}.:
e.g. World Bank, International Monetary Fund, etc. The NASEM report does
not adequately acknowledge this history -- nor does it offer suggestions
and recommendations for how to avoid U.S. dominance in international
governance of solar geoengineering. Instead, the NASEM report recommends
setting up an 'ad hoc working group ... to address future governance
needs for SG research' (p. 190), and includes a vague suggestion that
the US research program should be developed 'in coordination with other
countries' (p. 145). Depending on the type and extent of international
coordination[, if the U.S. acts to invest substantially in solar
geoengineering research, it could preempt global cooperation and further
marginalize vulnerable groups and communities who might be most affected
by solar geoengineering]{.underline} (Biermann and Möller 2019).
Moreover, [a unilateral U.S. research program could catalyze global
competition among countries]{.underline} and is likely to orient future
development of both research and its governance toward a U.S.-centric,
technocratic vision of climate response (Gupta et al. 2020). This
undermines efforts to elevate the perspectives and priorities of the
people around the world most affected by climate change. The U.S. has
become the world leader in solar geoengineering research during the past
five years, with multiple private philanthropies funding research at
major universities. Harvard researchers have received the most private
research funding so far, and their proposals for outdoor field
experiments -- the SCoPEx (Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation
Experiment) project -- have already triggered international controversy
(Fountain and Flavelle 2021). The NASEM report recommends expanding
these philanthropic-academic research efforts substantially through
federal policy and increased public investment to support more research.
To be clear, ceteris paribus, a publicly funded research program is
preferable to a privately funded research program. Yet, the report notes
that public funding should not replace philanthropic funding, but
suggests that U.S. public and private sector funding agencies should
coordinate to develop codes of conduct for responsible research (p.
157). This recommendation provides legitimacy for continued
philanthropic funding of solar geoengineering research, which has
primarily attracted white male tech-billionaires and other wealthy
individuals or their foundations (Biermann and Moller, 2019). In the
absence of effective public engagement and broad-based global
governance, public [U.S. funding would be supporting a top-down and
exclusive research program that is driven by and legitimizes U.S.
interests. It also risks promoting the interests of billionaires and
other powerful actors that tend to dominate the U.S. policy
process]{.underline}, and are already shaping solar geoengineering
research in the U.S. (Stephens and Surprise 2020, Kumbamu 2020). [Given
widespread mistrust of the U.S. on climate change, and the legacy of the
U.S. taking unilateral action in international affairs, we are concerned
that U.S. unilateralism in advancing solar geoengineering technology
will increase geopolitical risks]{.underline}, [including increased
securitization and the potential for militarization of this
planetary-scale intervention]{.underline} (Biermann and Moller, 2019,
Surprise 2020). [Proponents and critics of solar geoengineering alike
draw attention to the dangerous potential for geopolitical conflict or
military involvement in solar geoengineering research and
deployment]{.underline} (Parker et al. 2018, Surprise 2020), but this
concern -- and the wider U.S. reputation in this context -- is given
scant consideration in the report. [A unilateral approach also risks
disrupting ongoing international efforts to build trust toward global
cooperation on solar geoengineering research]{.underline} (Jinnah et al.
2019), including initiatives within the U.N. Convention on Biological
Diversity and at the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), where
the US, stood alongside Saudi Arabia,Footnote2 to block efforts for
international cooperation on solar geoengineering governance and
research (Stefanini 2019).

#### Solar geoengineering will provoke international conflict

[Imagine]{.underline} the following scenario: it is the year 2035. [One
large country]{.underline}, dealing with major issues of global warming,
decides to take extreme action. The government [begins secret deployment
of a geoengineering system for pumping large amounts of reflective
particles into the air,]{.underline} a technique designed [to mimic the
cooling effect of a volcanic eruption]{.underline}, only on a much
larger scale and over a much longer time horizon. Although such behavior
has been discouraged by the international community, research has
continued, largely behind closed doors and without real regulation. [Now
that the climate situation has become more dire, the country has decided
that it can no longer afford to wait; they see geoengineering as their
only option]{.underline}. [At first, the decision seems wise, as the
increase in global temperatures start to level off. But soon other types
of anomalous weather begin to appear:]{.underline} unexpected and severe
droughts hit countries around the world, disrupting agriculture, and the
ozone layer begins to decay rapidly, exposing populations to harmful
radiation. [Global weather has become
politicized]{.underline}---[delegates argue at the United Nations over
new climate complications allegedly caused by geoengineering, and
diplomatic relationships are strained]{.underline}. [This new
geoengineering crisis escalates when another large country, under the
impression it has been severely harmed by the geoengineering, carries
out a focused military strike against the geoengineering equipment, a
decision supported by other nations who also believe they have been
negatively impacted]{.underline}. [This development]{.underline},
however, [becomes even more devastating, as once the geoengineering
stops, global temperatures dramatically rebound to the levels they would
have reached on their previous trajectory, prior to the use of
geoengineering. The resulting consequences of such a dramatic increase
in temperatures are disastrous]{.underline}.

#### Unilateral efforts to geoengineer the Arctic will generate international backlash

Solutions: Cascading Security and Ethical Considerations,"

With little doubt, diplomacy and science will likely be charged to
provide leadership in global geoengineering endeavors, including the
Arctic region; however, [to assume that an Arctic geoengineering
solution will be developed]{.underline} and implemented
[through]{.underline} naturally [peaceful]{.underline} and cooperative
[means might be a mistake]{.underline}. Additionally, domestic actors
will likely pressure national authorities with concerns of local
negative impacts. The securitization process helps to describe how such
non‐military concerns can result in is‐ sues of national security and
interests, which could greatly affect the ability of an interna‐ tional
coalition to adopt solutions; however, studying the securitization and
consequen‐ tialism circumstances for the Arctic could help facilitate
cooperative efforts toward resolv‐ ing tensions in order to achieve
desired regional objectives. At the very least, such consid‐ erations
could help to manage overall expectations, as well as to acknowledge
legitimate and competing perspectives. Such challenges remain the
purview of the diplomatic corps of the world who are well trained and
experienced in dealing with multinational issues and tensions. For the
circumpolar North, the Arctic Council represents the lead international
institution with significant proficiency in overseeing efforts in
support of environmental and Indigenous solutions. Although unlikely to
directly oversee geoengineering efforts for the Arctic, the organization
provides a highly relevant example of what coalition‐led efforts offer
in the realm of scientific uncertainty and understanding that is deeply
connected to regional stakeholders. It is plausible that the Arctic
Council could contribute to any number of components, whether through
efforts to improve scientific understanding, through en‐ hanced
monitoring, or through the establishment of guidance based working
groups, making the lessons learned there additionally valuable to any
implementation strategies. Many Arctic Council projects and initiatives
involve the study of processes that affect the entire region, not unlike
geoengineering. The Arctic Council is by design a consensus‐ based
organization, where the eight member nations retain decision‐making
authority, and six permanent participant groups representing Arctic
Indigenous peoples have full consultation rights. Of note, the Arctic
Council does not engage in issues of military secu‐ rity \[30\]. As a
result, topics involving sensitive national security interests cannot
get in on the agenda, or they are otherwise rejected if member nations
are instructed or compelled to do so. The securitization process warns
us that issues can go from acceptable dialogue and consideration to a
diplomatically difficult situation---possibly even elevated to an
emergency level in extreme scenarios. To maintain a geoengineering
dialogue in a collab‐ orative or consensus building environment such as
the Arctic Council, it will require an understanding of potential
conflict and competition points in advance to prevent or limit the
securitization of these issues. Within that context, [it is not only
possible but plausible that nations may not easily agree to
geoengineering solutions as a result of conflicting national security
interests.]{.underline} To disregard such opposition, even in an
adversarial‐based system (such as the United Na‐ tions), might lead to
the development of dangerous consequences. Unlike the Arctic Council, it
would be anticipated that the responsible body with regard to Arctic
geoengi‐ neering would likely have two overarching organizational
objectives: (1) identifying and defining the problem(s) to be resolved
in a typical framework instrument (e.g., Vienna Convention), followed by
(2) establishing the implementation, maintenance, and inspec‐
tion/review requirements in a typical protocol instrument, such as the
Montreal Protocol \[31\]. What determines the structure and authorities
of any potential geoengineering‐related organization is yet to be seen,
although the history and process of similarly related en‐ deavors are
well‐known and documented. Part of any international organization's
efforts involving management of geoengineering will invariably include a
significant amount of interdisciplinary literature reviews. For example,
not only will the impact of global cli‐ mate systems as a result of
geoengineering need to be relatively well known, but a critical
understanding of the processes and norms of securitization and
consequentialism will also need to be a part of considerations where
tensions over issues are concerned. [It is of paramount importance that
international organizations are set up for success from the start,
because the alternatives are often exponentially counter‐productive, and
delays late in the process may lead to a failure to reach diplomatic
solutions]{.underline}. As with any international treaty/convention, the
most commonly recognized types concern international law \[32\], but not
all nations become full‐party members, nor do all nations remain
members. This would likely be the case with any framework convention and
protocol involving Arctic geoengineering, especially because the vast
majority of en‐ vironmental agreements tend to function on the premise
of reducing production, con‐ sumption, or processes, rather than the
introduction of engineering‐based solutions. For example, the
international solution for dealing with the ozone problem as per the
Mon‐ treal Protocol involved a significant reduction in use of the
substances responsible for the problem. Other agreements have found
solutions in reductions or a change in human be‐ haviors, such as the
precautionary moratorium on unregulated high‐seas Arctic fishing
activities, until a greater understanding of impacts could be achieved
\[3\]; however, [geoen‐ gineering solutions]{.underline} in the context
of this article [will likely involve adding something new to the
environment, which, once released, might not be as easily
controlled]{.underline}. This circum‐ stance would be fairly novel and
especially difficult as part of an agreement, based on ongoing
monitoring and management requirements. Unlike other conventions where
non‐party member nations might not interfere with the agreement,
[geoengineering in the Arctic atmosphere would undoubtedly draw active
opposition from non‐party members]{.underline}. Whether in the Arctic,
Northern Hemisphere, or anywhere else, [affected nations could have a
justification for withholding support, knowing full well that what
happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arcti]{.underline}c. [This
leads to the potential for a range of scenarios, where independent or
unilateral attempts at geoengineering solutions may have consequences
outside the intended area of impac]{.underline}t, and may affect the
food security, energy security, and other forms of security within other
nation's political boundaries. [Modeling efforts have already identified
that asymmetrical approaches to geoengineering in the Arctic may lead to
alterations in the Inter‐tropical Convergence Zone]{.underline} (ITCZ),
creating a reduction in local precipitation in por‐ tions of the
Southern hemisphere \[33\]. Although the oceans and atmosphere form
compo‐ nents of the global commons \[34\], alterations to those features
have the potential to di‐ rectly affect areas within terrestrial
boundaries. P[rior conflicts over fishing resources]{.underline}, in‐
cluding access and distribution, [offer examples here as to the
connections between shared resources and the potential for conflict.
Previous efforts at geoengineering]{.underline}, such as iron
fertilization, [when connected with issues of fishery management, may
provide insights as to the ability for such issues to become
securitized]{.underline} \[35\]. Additionally, when framed as a
disruptive technology, nation‐[states may be incentivized to develop
cutting edge systems]{.underline} that produce improvements to regional
outputs, whether from fisheries, agriculture, or other means, [at the
cost of neighboring or even distant regions, creating regional losses
that may generate antagonistic perceptions.]{.underline}

#### Unilateral geoengineering turns climate wars -- risks nuclear escalation

[Military planners recognise climate change as a 'threat
multiplier']{.underline}. US defence chiefs, among others, have
incorporated a changing climate into their military planning and
equipment supply. Climate change is expected to create political
instability; indeed, some experts believe that climate change-induced
drought, high food prices and migration to cities nudged Syria into
civil war. If that's true -- and we can only guess at how much conflict
there might be in a world 3°C warmer -- [mitigating warming by
geoengineering]{.underline} [ought to create a more peaceful world. But
it's not so straightforward.]{.underline} When hit by a devastating
flood, drought or storm, a community will tend to see it as an act of
God -- a natural event that it just has to cope with. But what if we
believed that the death and destruction were caused not by nature but by
someone manipulating the weather? If another nation were engineering the
climate, its politicians' denials would fall on deaf ears, and not just
because humans naturally look for someone to blame. [If a nation had
embarked on a system-altering form of climate engineering]{.underline}
like sulphur dioxide spraying, [it would be virtually impossible to work
out whether an extreme weather event somewhere in the world was due to
natural variability, human-induced climate change or climate
manipulation]{.underline}. **[And climate manipulation would quite
likely get the blame.]{.underline}** The government of China, faced with
a catastrophic drought in the north of the country, might decide its
survival demanded rapid global cooling. But sending up planes to spray
sulphur dioxide might deprive India and Pakistan of their monsoon rains,
bringing on famine. Three [nuclear-armed nations would]{.underline} then
[be in conflict over weather patterns]{.underline} that affect the
survival of millions of their citizens. It's hard to know who might
first be tempted to regulate the global climate. Given the severe
environmental and geopolitical risks, and the deep ethical divide over
whether humans should 'play God', governments in democratic countries
may be hamstrung. Authoritarian leaders who do not need public approval
to act may have a freer hand. Do we want Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping
controlling our weather? A dictator with his hand on the global
thermostat is a scary prospect. But imagine if several poorer nations
(let's say Bangladesh, Tuvalu, the Maldives and Ethiopia) clubbed
together and declared: "The rich countries that caused global warming
promised to cut their emissions, but they have not done so. Our people
are dying, so we must take unilateral action. We are sending up a fleet
of planes to spray sulphur dioxide." Now the moral calculus leaves us
uncertain what to think. Don't they have the right to save themselves
from an existential threat, even if by risky means? What would it mean
for floods and storms in other countries? Would the United States or
China be entitled to shoot down their planes? Reaching a consensus to
regulate the Earth's climate would, in the words of a 2013 study, "pose
immense challenges to liberal democratic politics". But then, liberal
democratic politics does not have a great record responding to climate
change, either. The elected president of the US, Donald Trump, has
announced that his country will be pulling out of the Paris Agreement,
an action that will slow emissions reductions and expose millions of
people, especially poorer individuals, to the devastating effects of a
warming world. In the circumstances, the only acceptable answer is a
global agreement to regulate research into geoengineering. [If it ever
comes to deployment, conflict could be avoided only if an inclusive
international institution makes the decision]{.underline}. [Without it,
one nation would control the climate of others, and those others will be
tempted to engage in their own 'counter-geoengineering]{.underline}'.
And then we really are in trouble.

### Unilateral Deployment Bad Turn -- Link Magnifier: Military

#### Geoengineering will cause conflict -- involvement of the military magnifies tensions

Dhanasree **Jayaram**, 9/20/**20**, \[Assistant Professor and
Co-Coordinator of Centre for Climate Studies, Manipal Academy of Higher
Education, Karnataka, India\], Wilson Center, "Without Attention,
Geoengineering Could Upend Foreign Policy,"
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/without-attention-geoengineering-could-upend-foreign-policy,
mm

In the summer of 2020, border tensions between India and China and the
future of their bilateral relations came to dominate the news cycle in
the subcontinent---or at least the space left over by the coronavirus
pandemic. Although foreign policy experts are right to discuss the
boundary dispute at the core of India-China tensions, they must not
ignore the many other potential sources of tensions. One of the most
significant is the probable implementation of large-scale geoengineering
projects. As emissions reductions prove elusive, major emitters are
increasingly looking for other solutions to reduce global warming. Both
China and India are exploring carbon dioxide removal or negative
emission technologies. More controversially, they are also studying
solar radiation management, a technological domain in which China is far
ahead of India and the risk of bilateral disagreement is extremely high.
The foreign policy community needs to incorporate climate change
issues---especially geoengineering---into foreign policy. [The emergence
of ambitious geoengineering technologies could exacerbate tensions and
even hostility between nations]{.underline} such as India and China.
Without regulation, [one country's efforts could affect other
countries]{.underline}. While China has not yet shown signs of
"unilaterally" deploying geoengineering projects on the ground, the
scale of its weather modification and other massive engineering
projects, including mega-dam projects (such as the Three Gorges),
suggests China is willing to deploy large-scale geoengineering schemes
to tackle the impacts of climate change and achieve its Paris targets.
Take, for example, China's large-scale weather modification project,
Tianhe, or Sky River---a cloud seeding geoengineering project. The
project has potential security implications for neighboring countries,
including India, and other South and Southeast Asian countries. Tianhe's
climate geoengineering venture aims to manage drought-like conditions in
the northern parts of the county that receive less rainfall and are
seeing declining water levels in its rivers. With the project, China
seeks to blast silver iodide particles into the atmosphere using
fuel-burning chambers in order to transfer more water from the Yangtze
River basin to the Yellow River basin via water vapor that becomes
rainfall. If past patterns repeat, conflicts may arise. India has
accused China of creating floods in its northeast through suspicious
dam-building activities. The Tianhe project could further heighten
concerns in the South and Southeast Asian regions, as the Tibetan
Plateau is the source of major rivers such as the Indus, and
Brahmaputra. Some Chinese scientists regard the project, led by
researchers from Tsinghua University and Qinghai University, as
technically "unfeasible," and scientifically "delusional." But if it is
to go through, it could unpredictably affect local and transboundary
ecosystems, precipitation patterns, and even the long-term regional
climate. These variables could raise the importance of information and
data sharing (transparency) that is at times held hostage by
geopolitical dynamics, as was the case during the 2017 Doklam military
standoff between India and China, when owing to "technical" reasons, the
latter did not share water flow data with the former. Just how solar
geoengineering may affect regional climate and weather patterns is
unclear, but the impacts are potentially significant. Climate change
already seems to be affecting the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR)
that is the lifeline of all the South Asian economies. Studies have
attributed a decline in the total rainfall and a concurrent rise in the
magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall events to climate change in
many parts of India and other South Asian countries. A few scientific
studies have also pointed out that using techniques such as injection of
stratospheric aerosols to cool the planet (the effect is comparable to
that of a volcanic eruption) may reduce rainfall in India and China and
may affect the ozone layer too, by thinning it. The deployment of such
initiatives in the region could therefore unleash far-reaching
repercussions for ecological, livelihood, economic, social, and human
security. [The consequences of]{.underline} a lack of safeguards on
[unregulated geoengineering could be disastrous]{.underline},
particularly for developing countries that do not possess enough
resources to undertake research and development (R&D) in the field,
deploy such schemes on a large-scale, or deal with their unintended
outcomes. Geoengineering research, especially solar geoengineering, both
in terms of technological innovation and futuristic governance
frameworks, continues to be dominated by the Global North (primarily
North America and Western Europe). These dynamics could exacerbate the
geopolitical divide between the haves and have-nots or winners and
losers, an asymmetry in the international system that developing
countries have long contested. Yet, scientists have spoken about the
need to implement geoengineering not just to prevent a future climate
emergency, but also to create "equity" in connection with the
possibility of reducing surface temperature faster than mitigation, in a
way that will be comparatively cheaper than adaptation, and as a moral
obligation to save the global poor. [Wherever militaries are involved,
we should proceed with caution]{.underline}. In some countries, the
military may already be playing a role in developing these technologies.
If and when the technologies are deployed on a wide scale, militaries
may be involved in various aspects of the process, including the
protection of project sites, R&D, and potential
militarization/weaponization (to have an upper hand in times of crises).
Tianhe, in fact, is being aided by the state-owned China Aerospace
Science and Technology Corporation, a "major space and defense
contractor," using "cutting-edge military rocket engine technology" and
"satellite network." [The involvement of the militaries in an already
geopolitically tense region without appropriate safeguards could lead to
further opaqueness, mistrust, disagreements, and conflict over the use
of such technologies]{.underline}.

promote it if it distracts from the urgent need for mitigation and
adaptation. Many different ideas for SRM have been explored by
scientists and entrepreneurs as ways to stabilise or lower temperatures
in the Arctic, even as most research has been restricted to modelling
studies. Ideas include making marine clouds brighter,1 covering surfaces
with reflective materials,2 and thickening sea ice using wind-powered
water pumps.3 Not all such techniques are likely to be effective or
desirable from a technical perspective,4--6 and in January 2025 the
Arctic Ice Project -- which had proposed spreading small silica-based
beads to increase the reflectivity of ice -- was stopped, in part due to
concerns about the risk of toxic effects on the Arctic food chain. In
addition to such technical uncertainties, there is, however, an
additional element of political uncertainty which is too often
overlooked. In fact, those working on Arctic SRM projects tend to
believe that "Arctic interventions pose less of a governance challenge
than global climate interventions", as Daniel Bodansky and Hugh Hunt
argue.7 They highlight the existence of the Arctic Council as an
effective institution for getting countries to agree on Arctic SRM,
while others have emphasised the small number of countries that would
need to come to an agreement.8 But recent research, including recent
work by Olaf Corry, Duncan McLaren, and myself, raises serious doubts
about the Arctic as a politically conducive region for SRM.9 In our
paper,10 we analysed literature on Arctic SRM, looking into the
assumptions researchers and entrepreneurs had about Arctic politics. We
also asked how the Arctic climate was understood as a problem that could
potentially be addressed via SRM. We then compared and contrasted their
views with those expressed in recent policy documents of Arctic
states.11 Our research found that SRM scientists and entrepreneurs
understand the Arctic as an exceptional region in international
politics, where inter-state cooperation on environmental and scientific
agendas can be separated from international security and competitive
dynamics between states. This idea of "Arctic exceptionalism",12
famously encapsulated in Mikhail Gorbachev declaring the Arctic a "zone
of peace", was prevalent in the decades after the Cold War and led to
many successful examples of inter-state cooperation -- particularly
through the Arctic Council of states and Indigenous organisations.
However, recent political developments on the global stage have made
"Arctic exceptionalism" appear increasingly outdated. [The relationship
between the Arctic NATO states and Russia has soured]{.underline}
markedly [since]{.underline} [the]{.underline} Russian [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014. It further deteriorated with the
full-scale invasion in 2022, which caused NATO states to temporarily
suspend their participation in the Arctic Council. [State strategies for
the Arctic increasingly see it as having a high risk of
conflict]{.underline}, [and there is a clear trend toward more military
presence in the Arctic]{.underline}.10 We also found that [mitigating
climate change is not a major priority in Arctic state
policies]{.underline}. [Instead, the changing Arctic climate is largely
seen as a new condition which must]{.underline} be adapted to or even
[seized upon strategically]{.underline} as an opportunity -- as
illustrated by US President Trump's continued efforts to gain control of
Greenland. [The warmer climate makes the Arctic more
accessible]{.underline}, enabling new strategies for creating economic
growth from the region, for example through extraction of oil, gas, or
minerals; new transcontinental shipping routes; and tourism. [This
creates security risks and competition]{.underline} which states respond
to by increasing surveillance and military presence, which, in turn,
creates more mistrust of motives among the NATO states and Russia.10 [To
anticipate how Arctic SRM would unfold in reality, we must place it in
this broader geopolitical context]{.underline}. As my colleagues and I
found in a related interview study of security experts,13 security
actors and climate scientists don't make sense of SRM in the same way.
Scientists and engineers are predominantly concerned with technical
uncertainties and aggregate impacts as they can be measured with models
and experiments, bracketing out human motives and interpretations. By
contrast, diplomats, security analysts, and [military actors make sense
of SRM through their pre-existing geopolitical logics]{.underline}. This
means, among other things, that [they think of SRM]{.underline} first
and foremost [as a strategic source of leverage in global
politics]{.underline}. [Rather than assuming it would be used to
mitigate climatic shifts in a rational way, they are concerned that
states will not trust each other's intentions]{.underline} around SRM
research and deployment, [and that the potential spread of
disinformation about SRM will make climate politics and international
cooperation more difficult]{.underline}. Therefore, [if a state were to
allow deployment]{.underline} or large-scale experiments [with SRM in
the increasingly conflictual Arctic]{.underline}, [the outcome would
be]{.underline} unpredictable but likely [destabilising]{.underline}.
**[It could trigger a diplomatic crisis, potentially sabotaging other
efforts to cooperate on environmental policy and
research.]{.underline}** [States might also consider their options for
"counter-geoengineering]{.underline}",14 which would compound the
technical uncertainties of SRM. However, [anticipation of such dynamics
could also make states prevent any deployment or experiments **from
getting off the ground in the first place**]{.underline}.13

#### Unilateral action triggers an international backlash -- leads to conflict and efforts to stop It which turns the case

Scott **Barrett**, Summer **2014**, Review of Environmental Economics
and Policy, 8(2), "Solar Geoengineering's Brave New World: Thoughts on
the Governance of an Unprecedented Technology,"
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1093/reep/reu011, mm

All of this leads to what I think is [the fundamental problem posed by
geoengineering]{.underline}: governance. A failure of governance could
lead to one of two errors: (a) failure to prevent geoengineering from
being used when it would be harmful overall; and (b) failure to deploy
geoengineering when it would be beneficial overall. Three attributes of
geoengineering [make governance challenging]{.underline}. First, a crude
form of geoengineering, such as the injection of sulfate aerosols, would
be cheap to deploy---so cheap that cost would be unlikely to be a major
factor in a decision to use it (Barrett 2008). Second, [geoengineering
could be undertaken unilaterally]{.underline}. Although, as mentioned
earlier, it is more likely that geoengineering would be done by a
"coalition of the willing," the important point is that in contrast to
efforts to reduce emissions in order to stabilize atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases, geoengineering does not require the
active engagement of all or even most of the world's countries. Finally,
geoengineering using sunlight-scattering sulfate particles could be
scaled up very quickly, changing mean global temperature in a matter of
months. This puts the use of geoengineering on a kind of "hair
trigger."24 Taken together, these three features imply not only that
solar geoengineering could be done unilaterally, but also that a single
country or coalition of countries may someday have a strong incentive to
deploy it unilaterally. [The problem is that all countries would be
affected]{.underline} by whatever is done (or not done), [and it is
unlikely that the interests of any one state]{.underline} or small
coalition of states wishing to use geoengineering [would coincide
precisely with the interests of all states]{.underline} collectively.
Thus the failure of governance that is most likely is the first
one---the failure to prevent geoengineering from being used when it
would be harmful overall.25 However, [a move by any one state to
geoengineer unilaterally would likely meet resistance]{.underline}.
[Such resistance might take the form of formal protests, trade
sanctions, or even threats of military action]{.underline}.
Alternatively, countries might offer financial or other assistance to
would-be geoengineering states, in exchange for their promise not to
geoengineer. In addition, [countries could threaten deployment of
"counter-geoengineering]{.underline}" (i.e., injection of particles that
warm the planet) or, as noted earlier, supplemental geoengineering
interventions. Rules for geoengineering could be codified in an
international agreement, but these rules would ultimately have to be
compatible with the self-interests of the states able and willing to
geoengineer.

Solar Geoengineering Would Breach the No-Harm Rule

[[Under]{.mark} customary [i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw, [states
have an obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm to]{.mark}
the territory of [other states and to areas beyond national
jurisdiction]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} rule, commonly referred to as the
'[no-harm' rule,]{.mark} developed from the 1938/41 Trail Smelter
arbitration and [has been affirmed as a principle of customary
international law by the International Court of Justice]{.mark}
(ICJ).]{.underline} 5 States have further acknowledged this rule in
soft-law declarations,6 and it is reiterated in MEAs, including the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC) 7 and the Convention on
Biological Diversity. 8 The no-harm rule has been invoked by states
before the ICJ,9 and it has been further considered by international
courts and tribunals.10 [[The no-harm rule continues to be a fundamental
and legally binding rule of international]{.mark} environmental
[law.]{.mark}]{.underline} Solar [[geoengineering will fall within the
scope of the no-harm rule, by posing risks of significant harm to the
territory of another state or to areas beyond national
jurisdiction.]{.underline}]{.mark} The threshold level of 'significant'
harm is widely understood to be harm that is more than 'detectable' but
not necessarily 'serious' or 'substantial'.13 [[Scientific understanding
of the]{.mark} precise nature and [scale of negative side-effects
from]{.mark} solar [geoengineering is limited, but]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering will plainly meet this threshold]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Potential negative transboundary side-effects from various solar
geoengineering proposals include changes in regional monsoon and
precipitation patterns, with associated implications for water security
and food production, 14 and further depletion of the stratospheric ozone
layer. Further negative impacts could result from the sudden termination
of a solar geoengineering program me, as species and ecosystems may be
unable to adapt to a rapid rise in temperature if atmospheric greenhouse
gas concentrations remain high.16It is uncertain whether all the risks
of transboundary harm from solar geoengineering can be prevented. My
opponent has referred to research indicating that the severity of
certain impacts, such as surface acid deposition and ozone depletion,
may be less than originally anticipated, or may be managed through
careful project design. [However, according to a recent review of
solar-geoengineering research by the IPCC, it remains uncertain whether
'the most adverse side-effects \[of solar geoengineering\] can be
avoided']{.underline}. 17 [Moreover, [solar geoengineering will involve
'novel perturbations to the imperfectly understood Earth system']{.mark}
[and could]{.mark} therefore [result in unforeseen, significant]{.mark}
adverse [transboundary impacts that]{.mark} may [take time to
manifest]{.mark}.]{.underline} 19 [[Under the no-harm rule]{.mark},
[states are obliged to take a precautionary approach]{.mark}. 20 [This
means that states should not disregard their obligations]{.mark} under
the no-harm rule [just because there is scientific uncertainty
concerning the]{.mark} precise [scope and nature of risks of
transboundary harm from]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering]{.mark}.]{.underline} 21Once triggered, the no-harm rule
provides states with an obligation of conduct, or 'due diligence', to
prevent significant transboundary harm. 22This includes conducting a
transboundary environmental impact assessment (EIA) 23 and notifying and
consulting with potentially affectedstates.24 Reynolds suggests that
states would easily satisfy these obligations and that solar
geoengineering therefore will not breach the no-harm rule. [However,
[due diligence also requires states to use 'all the means' at their
disposal to prevent]{.mark} significant [transboundary harm]{.mark}.
[The]{.mark} content and [standard of due diligence depends on the
nature of an activity and the scientific and technological knowledge
regarding it, with riskier activities requiring a higher
standard]{.mark} of due diligence.26 [Given the magnitude and
uncertainty of risks from solar geoengineering, the no-harm rule would
provide states with a very high standard of due diligence]{.mark}.
Contrary to what Reynolds suggests, [this standard will not be 'easy' to
satisfy, and]{.mark} it may be [impossible for states to take sufficient
preventative measures to discharge this
obligation]{.mark}]{.underline}.27Moreover, a key component of due
diligence that states would need to satisfy for solar geoengineering is
regulation, and states are yet to demonstrate a capacity to achieve
this. To satisfy this obligation, states would need to take sufficient
measures to regulate and control the risks of
solargeoengineering.28First, states must adopt appropriate rules and
measures under domestic law and vigilantly enforce them.29 To date, no
state has enacted rules under domestic law to specifically regulate the
risks of solar geoengineering, and existing domestic environmental laws
are inadequate to meet the unique governance challenges of these
technologies.30 Second, states would need to exercise administrative
control over the activity's operators.31 Due to the novel and
experimental nature of solar geoengineering, it is questionable whether
state regulatory bodies would have the expertise or experience to
effectively exercise such control.32 Third, states would also need to
care-fully consider the technology.33 [[The I]{.mark}ntergovernmental
[P]{.mark}anel on [C]{.mark}limate [C]{.mark}hange the leading
scientific assessment body in the world for climate change, [has been
unable to provide a comprehensive assessment of the feasibility and
impacts of solar geoengineering.]{.mark}34 It is therefore difficult to
see how states could accomplish this. [Without the capacity to regulate
and control solar geoengineering,]{.mark} states cannot satisfy their
obligation of due diligence, and [any solar geoengineering will breach
the no-harm rule.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Strong international law caps [downside risks]{.underline} of [existential]{.underline} emerging technology AND several pathways to [nuke war]{.underline}.

**Sears '20** \[Nathan Alexander; 2020; Founder of the Regulatory
Institute; Global Policy, "Existential Security: Towards a Security
Framework for the Survival of Humanity," p. 262-263\]

By what means and modes of protection? The [[existential
security]{.underline}]{.mark} frame [[requires
**innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the means and modes of security
policy. This is [because the [conventional emphasis]{.mark}]{.underline}
on military capabilities and balancing [[is]{.mark} either
[inadequate]{.mark} (e.g. [**nuclear war**), irrelevant]{.mark} (e.g.
**[climate]{.mark} change**), [or counterproductive]{.mark} (e.g.
**[AI]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. Moreover, [the pursuit of relative
gains]{.underline}/losses in security [is fundamentally misguided for
anthropogenic existential threats, since -- as a general principle --
either **all** human societies are safe, or **none** of them are.
Existential security requires a **paradigm shift** from thinking about
security policy as a matter of (national) 'defense' to being a matter of
(global) 'governance']{.underline}. Governance is not an end in itself
(e.g. the creation of a 'world state'), but rather a means to security
(i.e. the survival of humankind). The pursuit of existential security
requires means of protection that involve a comprehensive set of
political, economic, and technological resources -- not merely military
capabilities. The modes of protection are primarily 'restraint' and
'resilience'. Restraint is a prevention strategy, while resilience is a
mitigation strategy, which take on different forms for different
threats. For the nuclear threat, restraint manifests itself in the
policies of disarmament, arms control, and nonproliferation, while
resilience comes mostly in the form of nuclear bunkers and shelters
(Bull, 1961; Deudney, 2007). For climate change, restraint is primarily
about limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the degradation of carbon
sinks, while resilience is about making societies less vulnerable to
heat stress, rising seas, food and water scarcities, new diseases, and
human migration (Wallace-Wells, 2019; World Bank, 2012). For AI,
restraint entails the slow and careful development of AI (Bostrom, 2014)
-- or perhaps forgoing the 'AI dream' altogether (Joy, 2000) -- while
resilience is about reducing societal vulnerability to technological
disruption (e.g. cybersecurity). Importantly, the growing survival
interdependence of human societies implies that restraint and resilience
must be mutual to be effective. If only some states choose disarmament
or nonproliferation, if some societies reduce carbon emissions while
others increase them, or [if one **tech**]{.underline}nology [firm
decides to rapidly pursue **'superintelligence'**, then the (in)action
of some actors may **affect** the security of **all**
humankind]{.underline}. This emphasis on mutual restraint and resilience
contrasts with the national security frame's emphasis on 'self-help'.

By which security actors? [For the foreseeable future, **states** will
remain **critical** security actors. Yet their importance]{.underline}
for existential security [derives from]{.underline} their [**political
authority**, not]{.underline} their **[military power]{.underline}**.
States remain the only entities with political authority to create and
enforce laws within their national territories, and regulate the
activities of other de facto security actors, including individual
citizens, private firms, and public entities. Global institutions and
[**[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}** [must]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[take]{.mark} on **[greater importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
International Atomic Energy Agency has had a critical role in reducing
the risk of the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons; and the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also plays an important role
in informing policy on climate change. A global institution to monitor
AI research -- and other emerging technologies -- would be a welcome
development. However, these 'watchdog' institutions are primarily for
monitoring and verification. Currently the sole political institution
that can address matters of compliance -- [the [UN]{.mark}]{.underline}
Security Council -- [[is **fettered** by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[veto
privilege]{.underline}]{.mark} and 'great power politics' of 'P5'
states. [Ultimately, [existential security **requires**]{.mark} global
governance]{.underline} in order [to strengthen humanity's [**collective
capacity** to **navigate**]{.mark} a **[growing]{.mark} spectrum** of
anthropogenic existential [threats. This]{.mark} will [mean]{.mark}
**developing [new]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- or reforming existing --
**[global political [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the power
and authority to act on behalf of the security of humanity. This, in
turn, depends on constructing a sense of 'identity' of humankind as a
common 'security community' (Craig, 2003; Deudney, 2007; Herz, 1959;
Wendt, 2003). In this sense, too, existential security responds to a
critical limitation of the national security frame: the self-limiting
security identity of its referent object, the nation state.

At what costs? Security always implies costs, especially when it is
prioritized relative to other values. Existential security is no
different. In particular, human individuals and societies might
sacrifice some degree of political liberty (e.g. new methods of
surveillance) (Bostrom, 2019), and/or economic wellbeing (e.g. new
regulations on consumption habits) (Rees, 2018) for the purposes of
existential security. The political interests of states (e.g. loss of
sovereignty) and economic interests of firms (e.g. loss of profits) may
also be affected -- though most likely as a matter of degree. Another
cost involves 'securitization' risks: political actors could invoke
'existential threats to humanity' to justify 'emergency measures' that
break free from 'normal politics' (Buzan et al., 1998). The 'politics of
security' has a dark-side (Aradau and Van Munster, 2007; Wæver, 2005),
and, while the risk seems far off, it is imaginable that the 'survival
of humanity' could become a political justification for a totalitarian
'world state' (Bostrom, 2019; Torres, 2017).

In what time period? Security policy generally responds to immediate
threats, although national security strategies may gaze up to 20--25
years into the future ('grand strategy'). Conversely, anthropogenic
[existential threats cover [timeframes]{.mark}]{.underline} extending
[[from **existing**]{.underline}]{.mark} threats [(e.g. **nuclear
war**), [to]{.mark}]{.underline} what are conventionally understood as
the **[['short']{.underline}]{.mark}** [(e.g.
**[bioterrorism]{.mark}**), 'medium' (e.g. **AI**), and 'long-term'
(e.g. **climate** change)]{.underline}. For example, the time horizon of
2045 has been given for 'highlevel machine intelligence' (Grace et al.,
2018), and 2100 for climate change (Steffen et al., 2018). Security
policy has difficulty with such timeframes; yet seen relative to the
duration of human civilization (\~10,000 years), or homo sapiens
(\~200,000 years), such time horizons seem more or less 'immediate'
(Baum et al., 2019). Thus, anthropogenic existential threats challenge
the 'short termism' of security policy (Fisher, 2019), and support the
premise that existential security requires an intergenerational
timeframe (Rees, 2018). In summary, existential security takes humankind
as its referent object, the survival of humanity as its core value,
anthropogenic existential threats as the principal dangers,
comprehensive capabilities and mutual restraint and resilience as the
means and modes of protection, nation states and global political
institutions as the key security actors, and an intergenerational
timeframe for security policy. Existential security therefore represents
an alternative to national security and human security as a framework
for security policy, which is based on the inadequacy of existing
security frames for the survival of humanity. While a shift from
national security to existential security represents a serious political
challenge within an 'anarchic' international system of sovereign nation
states (Waltz, 1979), there is perhaps no better catalyst for a paradigm
shift in security policy than humanity's interest in 'survival'. As
Yuval Noah Harari (2018) writes, ['[Humankind]{.mark} now [faces the
**triple crisis** of **nuc**]{.mark}lear [**war**, climate]{.mark}
change [and **tech**]{.mark}nological [disruption. Unless humans
realise]{.mark} their common predicament and make [**common cause**,
they are **unlikely to survive**]{.mark} this crisis.']{.underline}

### International Law Turn -- AT Low Now

#### Global adherence to international law norms is strong now

Maximilian **Bertamini '24**, PhD candidate at the Institute for
International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (IFHV). His doctoral
research on the legality of resource mining in outer space revolves
around 'national appropriation' in international law, sovereignty and
property in legal theory, and outer space law. Voelkerrechtsblog.

https://voelkerrechtsblog.org/defending-international-law-in-2024 // SZ

I believe that it is every international lawyer's responsibility to have
a rock-solid reply to such challenges. But to me, our attempts often
feel a bit apologetic, construed, cumbersome. Popular choices include:
["A world without international law would be even worse"]{.underline}
(e.g. here) and giving examples for the few (mostly ineffective)
enforcement mechanisms that we do have (e.g. here). Unfortunately, it is
all too easy to counter the first with "How would we notice?" or "Good
luck explaining that to the people in
Gaza/Ukraine/Taiwan/Yemen/Sudan/Myanmar/etc.". And attempt No. 2 is a
dead end, at least as far as reference is made to the veto-infested
Security Council, the short-armed ICC or to any court whose judgments do
not come with enforcement.

But what could we reply instead? I have some suggestions.

**[[States need I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational **[[Law, and they
almost always comply]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even the "bad guys"!).

; Today's world is so interconnected that no single state can afford
isolation. [**[States]{.mark}** heavily **[rely on]{.mark}**
international coordination and cooperation. Some depend on exporting
their goods, others depend on importing resources]{.underline} and
[many]{.underline} [rely on external support up to the stage of military
alliances. **[Coordinating and cooperating effectively]{.mark}** and
somewhat predictably requires an international order]{.underline}. One
dimension of this is the optimization of international relations at a
purely functional level. This dimension comes naturally to most
observers and so comes its criticism: As soon as it is "optimal" for a
state to blaze its own trail outside of that order, sticking to it loses
its appeal and potentially its legitimacy. But there is a second
dimension of importance to the international order that is international
law, which is more easily overlooked: Because no state can afford
isolation, all states experience the existential necessity to be
perceived as orderly participants in international relations, as
reliable partners. The [broader a state's disregard for the
international order]{.underline} -- and thereby for the order-upholding
participants -- is displayed, [the greater the ensuing isolation and
loss of legitimacy will be.]{.underline}

Now, isolation is not a legal concept -- yet. And it comes in varying
degrees. Not every violation of international law is met with isolation
and its direction can be selective at times. But this does not
invalidate the point about all states striving to be perceived as
law-abiding. When Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it
made considerable efforts to justify its conduct in the vocabulary of
international law. You may remember the Russian narrative of preventing
Genocide, defending against Western aggression and being invited to
intervene by the alleged Peoples Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.
Simultaneously, Israel defends its conduct in the war in Gaza and
against terrorist organizations-- despite Israeli atrocities being
committed regularly -- towards an ever-shrinking circle of supporters in
the vocabulary of international law. That [even those **[states
breaching i]{.mark}**nternational **[law]{.mark}** employ its logic to
**[defend]{.mark}** **[themselves against accusations is a powerful
indication of the weight]{.mark}** they ascribe **[to]{.mark}** the
**[international]{.mark}** legal **[order]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As
long as this is the case, as long as [legal order is preferred over
anarchy and the blatant right of the strongest, **[the importance of
i]{.mark}**nternational **[law cannot be
invalidated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We may debate over and criticize its
effectiveness in important areas. But we may not naively ignore this
most important fact: That at its core, where it provides a baseline
structure for the modern state's existential necessity to avoid
isolation, international law is indispensable.

And before the criticism of this very restricted baseline of
international law's relevance even comes up: For the absolute majority
of states, abiding to international law far beyond the scope of
necessity was and still is nothing but natural.

Louis Henkin's 1968 observation still applies today:

It is fair to say that [most nations observe most principles of
international law and most of their international obligations most of
the time]{.underline}; it is probably the case, even, that [**[almost
all nations observe]{.mark}** almost all **[principles of
i]{.mark}**nternational **[law and]{.mark}** almost all of **[their
obligations almost all of the time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (Henkin,
179).

The Enforcement-Fetish misunderstands Law.

Enforceability of international law is always criticized as weak. And
weak enforceability is a problem for international law's effectiveness,
especially where commands and prohibitions are concerned. And even more
so, when these commands and prohibitions encapsulate cornerstones of
international peace and conscience.

Nevertheless, it is not enforcement that makes law binding. And even
more importantly: Reducing law to commands and prohibitions restricts it
to a level of undercomplexity that borders on the ignorance of law.

There are of course several different theories on what makes law
binding. As international law largely consists of agreements, we should
consider the following: When two autonomous entities enter into an
agreement, it is their mutual, corresponding and ultimately codependent
self-restriction of autonomy that gives legal weight to their agreement.
Unfairness and problematic side-effects on third parties
notwithstanding, this consent is also what justifies enforcement. If the
relationship between enforcement and legal value were reversed, law
would be nothing more than subjection to the will of the strongest
enforcer. This may have been how law worked centuries ago, but certainly
not today.

Not only is **[[enforcement not the determining factor for what should
be considered law]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, requiring
enforceability turns a blind eye to all the legal norms which are not
commands and prohibitions, but rights, principles or technical rules.
Think of the principles of interpretation, the rules governing the
status of global commons, procedural rules, the rules creating
organizations, privileges, equality.

How should an international law sheriff enforce doctrinally sound
interpretation? Whom should they arrest to uphold the jurisdiction of a
court or the allocation of competences in an international organization?
Who should be shot to ensure freedom of navigation on the High Seas? And
who should receive a ticket when it comes to determining the existence
of customary international law or a new state?

A large part of international law provides structure to international
relations through norms that do not directly impose behavior. They are
better understood as creating the legal environment that states exist
in. While the rules of the game may benefit (greatly) from enforcement,
trying to enforce the pieces of the game or the board itself makes no
sense.

Domestic law, which shapes our daily lives and comes to mind for most
when they think of "law" in general, makes us take the existence of
board and pieces for granted. But we must be careful to not transfer
this to the much more volatile realm of international relations. Having
a board to play on in the first place, something that provides
structure, context and predictability, is nothing short of an
achievement of foundational importance for international relations
today.

Thus, I am ultimately convinced that [we do not even have to address the
enforcement criticism]{.underline} at the level of giving examples and
thereby implicitly accepting effective enforcement as a core requirement
of relevance. But if we do go there, here are three things to consider:

1\. [Decentralized enforcement through sanctions, tariffs and political
isolation is a common, yet often overlooked practice in international
relations]{.underline}. Although not on their own, decentralized
sanctions helped to overthrow the apartheid system in South Africa.

2\. While domestic law may be more enforceable than international law,
it is often not enforced Certain grave offences are notoriously
difficult to enforce (think of crimes that typically occur behind closed
doors) and most minor ones are overlooked or addressed through public
disapproval rather than the justice system.

3\. When it comes to litigation, keeping point No. 2 in mind,
[international law's quota of litigations to violations is in all
likelihood far above that of domestic law]{.underline}. The number of
offences against international law is, by way of the simple fact that
the relevant actors are hundreds instead of billions, almost
incalculably smaller than that under domestic law. International
litigation before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), regional
international courts and the myriads of cases of international arbitral
tribunals is generally an active business. Thus, the numbers of pursued
international litigation logically far trump those of domestic law
enforcement.

### International Law Turn -- Link Extension

#### Solar geoengineering would violate the no-harm rule -- this breaks a fundamental aspect of international environmental law

Kerryn Anne **Brent**, **2021**, "Solar Geoengineering Is Prohibited
Under International Law," Debate Climate Law (eds. Benoit Mayer and
Alexander Zahar), pps. 274 -- 284, mm

[Under customary international law, states have an obligation to prevent
significant transboundary harm to the territory of other
states]{.underline} and to areas beyond national jurisdiction.
[This]{.underline} rule, commonly referred to as the ['no-harm'
rule,]{.underline} developed from the 1938/41 Trail Smelter
arbitrationFootnote4 and [has been affirmed as a principle of customary
international law]{.underline} by the International Court of Justice
(ICJ).Footnote5 States have further acknowledged this rule in soft-law
declarations,Footnote6 and it is reiterated in MEAs, including the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)Footnote7 and the
Convention on Biological Diversity.Footnote8 The no-harm rule has been
invoked by states before the ICJ,Footnote9 and it has been further
considered by international courts and tribunals.Footnote10 [The no-harm
rule continues to be a fundamental and legally binding rule of
international environmental law]{.underline}. [Solar geoengineering will
fall within the scope of the no-harm rule, by posing risks of
significant harm to the territory of another
state]{.underline}Footnote11 or to areas beyond national
jurisdiction.Footnote12 The threshold level of 'significant' harm is
widely understood to be harm that is more than 'detectable' but not
necessarily 'serious' or 'substantial'.Footnote13 Scientific
understanding of the precise nature and scale of negative side-effects
from solar geoengineering is limited, but solar geoengineering will
plainly meet this threshold. [Potential negative transboundary
side-effects from various solar geoengineering proposals include changes
in regional monsoon and precipitation patterns, with associated
implications for water security and food
production]{.underline},Footnote14 [and further depletion of the
stratospheric ozone layer]{.underline}.Footnote15 Further negative
impacts could result from the sudden termination of a solar
geoengineering programme, as species and ecosystems may be unable to
adapt to a rapid rise in temperature if atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations remain high.Footnote16 It is uncertain whether all the
risks of transboundary harm from solar geoengineering can be prevented.
My opponent has referred to research indicating that the severity of
certain impacts, such as surface acid deposition and ozone depletion,
may be less than originally anticipated, or may be managed through
careful project design. However, [according to a recent review of
solar-geoengineering research by the IPCC, it remains uncertain whether
'the most adverse side-effects \[of solar geoengineering\] can be
avoided']{.underline}.Footnote17 Moreover, solar geoengineering will
involve 'novel perturbations to the imperfectly understood Earth
system'Footnote18 and could therefore result in unforeseen, significant
adverse transboundary impacts that may take time to manifest.Footnote19
Under the no-harm rule, states are obliged to take a precautionary
approach.Footnote20 This means that states should not disregard their
obligations under the no-harm rule just because there is scientific
uncertainty concerning the precise scope and nature of risks of
transboundary harm from solar geoengineering.Footnote21

#### Solar geoengineering is prohibited under international law

Kerryn Anne **Brent**, **2021**, "Solar Geoengineering Is Prohibited
Under International Law," Debate Climate Law (eds. Benoit Mayer and
Alexander Zahar), pps. 274 -- 284, mm

This chapter has demonstrated that [states will breach their
international legal obligations if they conduct large-scale solar
geoengineering. This is]{.underline} primarily [because such activities
will breach the obligation of due diligence of states under customary
international law to prevent significant transboundary
harm]{.underline}. Rules of treaty interpretation also mean that [states
have limited discretion in how they can interpret existing treaty
obligations]{.underline}. [States must]{.underline} interpret treaty
provisions in light of the object and purpose of a treaty and [take
into]{.underline} account other international law obligations that exist
between parties, including [the no-harm rule]{.underline}. These rules
of treaty interpretation mean that [provisions within]{.underline} MEAs
\[[multilateral environmental agreements]{.underline}\] [cannot be
interpreted to encourage or permit solar geoengineering.]{.underline}
Finally, [states will not be able to rely on the doctrine of necessity
to excuse any breaches of their international obligations]{.underline},
as they cannot satisfy the strict conditions of that doctrine. [As a
result, solar geoengineering **is effectively prohibited under
international law**]{.underline}.

### International Law Turn -- Link -- AT "Doctrine of Necessity"

#### The U.S. wouldn't be able to invoke the doctrine of necessity to shield itself against breaches of international law

Kerryn Anne **Brent**, **2021**, "Solar Geoengineering Is Prohibited
Under International Law," Debate Climate Law (eds. Benoit Mayer and
Alexander Zahar), pps. 274 -- 284, mm

[In the event that solar geoengineering should breach international law,
Reynolds suggests that the wrongfulness of such an act may be precluded
under the doctrine of necessity]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, as
noted by the ILC in the commentaries to its draft articles on state
responsibility, [a state may only invoke this doctrine in exceptional
circumstances]{.underline}, where the 'only way' in which the state can
protect an essential interest from a 'grave and imminent peril' is by
breaching an international obligation.Footnote52 [The conditions to
claim necessity are therefore strictly defined and very challenging for
a state to satisfy]{.underline}.Footnote53 First, it is unlikely that
solar geoengineering will be the only means available to states to
protect their essential interests. According to the ILC, [states may be
unable to invoke the doctrine of necessity if the peril could be averted
through other action, including cooperative action with other states or
international organizations]{.underline}.Footnote54 [It may therefore be
difficult for states to rely on this defence i]{.underline}f they can
engage in cooperative action to mitigate climate change and adapt to its
impacts through the UNFCCC.Footnote55 States cannot rely on this defence
just because other means available to them, such as mitigation,
adaptation, or negative-emission technologies, may be more expensive or
inconvenient.Footnote56 Second, [the wrongful act must not 'seriously
impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the
obligation exists]{.underline}, or of the international community as a
whole'.Footnote57 [Solar geoengineering is likely to impair the
essential interests of other states. In addition to damaging
transboundary environmental impacts]{.underline},Footnote58 [solar
geoengineering could also have significant implications for
international peace and security]{.underline}. [The use of solar
geoengineering by one state,]{.underline} or a small group of states,
[without the consent of others may heighten geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}. According to Lockyer and Symons, it could
increase rivalry between powerful states, such as the United States and
China.Footnote59 They further suggest that states that conduct solar
geoengineering could use the risks associated with the sudden
termination of solar geoengineering to coerce other states, and that
states might resort to 'counter-geoengineering' or the use of military
force to stop a geoengineering programme.Footnote60 [The potential for
solar geoengineering to inflame geopolitical tensions and destabilize
international security would be against the essential interests of
individual states and the entire international community.]{.underline}
Finally, [states cannot rely on the doctrine of necessity if they have
contributed to the situation of necessity]{.underline}.Footnote61 [All
states have contributed to the elevated levels of greenhouse gas
emissions in the atmosphere. Furthermore, most states continue to rely
heavily on fossil fuels for their energy and transportation needs,
thereby further contributing to climate change. It is therefore unlikely
that states can plead necessity if they conduct solar geoengineering in
breach of their international obligations]{.underline}.

### International Law Turn -- Impact -- AT Not Enforced

#### Despite slowdowns, international law still governs state behavior

Jonathan **Kuttab**, 1/29/**25**, Arab Center Washington DA, "The
Slowdown in Enforcing International Law,"
https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/the-slowdown-in-enforcing-international-law/,
mm

But in recent years, [the process of expansion]{.underline} and
development [of international law has slowed down]{.underline}. The
United States, which once led the process, now seems to be deliberately
opposing it. During his first term in office, President Donald [Trump
emphasized the "America First" principle]{.underline} in his foreign
policy which often included an open disrespect for the principles of
international law that, to him, negatively impacted American interests.
His general disregard for international law was on full display in his
administration's handling of Middle East issues and bias in favor of
Israel's interest. He recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved
the American embassy there; accepted Israel's sovereignty over the
illegally occupied Syrian Golan Heights; and recognized Morocco's
sovereignty over the Western Sahara, apparently as a reward to the
kingdom for normalizing relations with Israel. Now that he has returned
to the White House, this attitude of disdain toward international law
seems to also cover other aspects of his foreign policy, as he talks of
annexing Greenland and the Panama Canal and suggests the idea of making
Canada the fifty-first state of the United States. Twice did Trump
withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, once during
his first term and recently after he started his second presidency, when
he issued an executive order rescinding President Joe Biden's decision
in 2021 to rejoin the accord. This attitude of disrespect for
international law is also evident in Congress's animosity toward the
ICC. Recently, the House of Representatives passed a law to punish and
sanction the ICC and any entity that supports bringing Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or other Israelis, to justice before that
court. But luckily the US Senate has refused to pass similar legislation
to sanction the court. [The example of the United States points to an
integral feature of international law---that it can only function
effectively if states actively participate in implementing and enforcing
it]{.underline}. This feature is bolstered by the nature of
international institutions that depend on the voluntary participation of
nation-states. The Statute that created the ICC itself specifically
proclaims that the court's jurisdiction is "complimentary" to that of
the nation-states, and expressly allows the court to take cases only
when national judicial bodies "are unable or unwilling" to deal with the
crimes that fall under its jurisdiction. To take another example, the
Geneva Conventions state that each signatory state has the duty to
"ensure compliance" with their provisions. This means that third parties
in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict other than Israel and the
Palestinians have a duty and an obligation to ensure compliance with the
Conventions, and failing to do so would render such parties guilty of
violating the Conventions themselves. The same stipulation and
obligation are found in the language of decisions by the International
Court of Justice, such as that in 2004 regarding Israel's construction
of a wall in the occupied Palestinian territories. In that case, the
court specifically proclaimed that all states that ratified the ICJ
statute have an obligation to see its decision carried through and to
take up specific actions on the basis of said decision. This opens the
door to a wide-ranging array of activism in the service of implementing
and enforcing international law. Instead of waiting for the ICC or the
ICJ to deal with international crimes like geocide and apartheid,
activists can also consider lobbying individual states to take up
specific actions of enforcement. They can also apply for redress to the
national courts of the different states to seek implementation of
provisions of international law in specific cases. Here are two examples
of such activism: Canadian activists have succeeded in requiring the
Canadian Tax authorities to rescind the tax exemption of the Jewish
National Fund in Canada, which has been channeling millions of dollars
in "charitable donations" to be used by settlers in carrying out
settlement activities in the occupied West Bank. Another case that
demands the suspension of arms sales to Israelin light of its genocidal
actions in Gaza is still pending. The Hind Rajab Foundationin Belgium
has actively sought warrants against a number of Israeli soldiers and
officials in several countries for war crimes and participation in the
genocide in Gaza on the basis of their own reports on social media where
they had filmed themselves and boasted about their criminal actions in
Gaza. Cases were filed in Brazil and other countries where these
Israelis were traveling on vacation. [To be sure, international law
**continues to govern** the behavior of states despite the skepticism
brought about by the impunity of certain countries]{.underline},
specifically Israel. [Enforcing its provisions]{.underline}, however,
[requires]{.underline} the active [involvement of nations and
states]{.underline}. Where states fail to carry out their obligations,
individuals and nongovernmental [organizations]{.underline}
[must]{.underline} collect evidence, lobby their governments, and
[find]{.underline} creative [ways to make sure the world is governed by
law rather]{.underline} than by jungle behavior in which the powerful
have their way with total impunity.

## AT Solvency

### AT MCB -- Fails

#### MCB is very Ineffective -- technical limitations

Jim M. **Haywood et al** 20**23**\[Phd in Meteorology, Professor of
Atmospheric Science (College of Mathematics, Engineering and Physical
Science\]"Climate intervention using marine cloud brightening (MCB)
compared with stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) in the UKESM1
climate model" <https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/15305/2023/> EMK

From Fig. 3, it is obvious that [the **injection** of significant
amounts of **sea salt**]{.underline} into bin 7 (mid-bin radius 23 nm)
[**is very ineffective**. The **change in cloud-top** CDNC is small
across the range of injection rates and, along with cloud fraction,
actually **decreases** with increasing injection rate,]{.underline}
thereby [acting **against** the objectives of MCB.]{.underline} [These
results are not dissimilar to those found for over-seeding]{.underline}
by Alterskjær et al. (2012) and Alterskjær and Kristjánsson (2013).
[[This reduction in cloud fraction translates to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the weakest perturbation to global ToA radiative fluxes and the [**least
global-mean cooling** of all the bins investigated.]{.underline} As the
size of the injected aerosols increases through to bin 10, progressively
more changes in CDNC, cloud fraction, ToA flux perturbation, and
[global-mean **temperature are obtained**, particularly at high
injection rates, before smaller changes are seen for injections into
bins 11 and 12]{.underline}. It therefore appears that, for UKESM1\'s
cloud droplet activation scheme, the optimal size for aerosol injection
to maximize the cooling from MCB is when the sea-salt dry radius is
around 85 nm. We therefore chose injection into bin 10 for G6MCB. Some
of the implications and limitations of utilizing the Abdul-Razzak and
Ghan (2000) activation scheme are highlighted in Sect. 5.

[**Studies** like Wan's **highlight** the **major knowledge gaps** that
remain **in a field that's been** mostly **confined** thus far **to
modeling**, and point up the vast uncertainties of how MCB should and
could be deployed.]{.underline}

For Wan, the "big picture" takeaway is that "[the widespread **climate
impacts** of a regional intervention will change under different climate
conditions,]{.underline}" [[meaning that]{.underline}]{.mark} testing
and deployment [[impacts in today's climate could be very different from
those in the]{.underline}]{.mark} more globally warmed
[[future]{.underline}]{.mark}.

["I think the paper shows convincingly that the effectiveness of marine
cloud brightening in a certain region can change with continued global
warming. \[But\] I'm not convinced that the change will always be to
diminish efficacy,"]{.underline} said Michael Diamond, assistant
professor of meteorology and environmental science at Florida State
University, who was not involved in the study. ["Other work has found
that very local deployments (like just over the Great Barrier Reef)
**don't seem to have detectable remote effects."**]{.underline}

In Diamond's view[, one conclusion could be that marine cloud
brightening may be an option for either large-scale or small-scale
deployment to protect fragile ecosystems, but **not appropriate at the
regional scale.**]{.underline}

that while MCB could quickly lower temperatures, [[it would also
suppress ENSO]{.underline}]{.mark}, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation,
which affects global weather patterns. MCB could cause the La Niña phase
of ENSO to persist, [[which would make the southern US hotter and drier

Another solar geoengineering technology, known as [marine cloud
brightening, seeks to make low-lying clouds more reflective]{.underline}
by spraying microscopic seawater droplets into the air. [Since 2017,
trials have been underway on the Great Barrier Reef.]{.underline} The
project is tiny in scale, and involves pumping seawater onto a boat and
spraying it from nozzles towards the sky. The project leader says the
mist-generating machine would need to be scaled up by a factor of ten,
to about 3,000 nozzles, to brighten nearby clouds by 30%. [After years
of trials, the project has not yet produced peer-reviewed empirical
evidence that cloud brightening could reduce sea surface temperatures or
protect corals from bleaching. The Great Barrier Reef is the size of
Italy. Scaling up attempts at cloud brightening would require up to
1,000 machines on boats, all pumping and spraying vast amounts of
seawater for months during summer. Even if it worked, the operation is
hardly]{.underline}, as its proponents claim, "environmentally
[benign]{.underline}". [The technology's effects remain
unclear.]{.underline} For the Great Barrier Reef, less sunlight and
lower temperatures could alter water movement and mixing, harming marine
life. [Marine life may also be killed by pumps or negatively affected by
the additional noise pollution. And on land, marine cloud brightening
may lead to altered rainfall patterns and increased salinity, damaging
agriculture]{.underline}. More broadly, [101 governments]{.underline}

geoengineering]{.underline}, including cloud brightening, [as having

[Although current efforts have primarily been focused on computer
simulations, and]{.underline} in rare cases, [small‐scale
experiments]{.underline}, [once large‐scale efforts are undertaken,
there exists the potential for substantial unintended consequences,
either due to unidentified interactions, potential miscalculations, or
lagging responses]{.underline}. Although a sense of urgency exists among
many with regard to the need for solutions to climate change, [without
proper due diligence, proposed solutions have the potential to
exacerbate current challenges and add tension between nation
states]{.underline} and their citizens, who bear the result of any
experimenta‐ tion. Under the concept of consequentialism, although the
aim for expediency may be well intended, failing to understand the
complex interactions leads to the concern that poorly understood
outcomes may lead to a net negative outcome, worsening the situation for
those affected. Although the available number of real‐world experiments
in geoengineer‐ ing has been limited, the deployment of large renewable
energy systems is more prevalent and can act as an example of positive
intentions, resulting in potential net negative out‐ comes once studied.
[Solar and wind technologies]{.underline}, for example[, are often
recognized as a way to reduce carbon emissions]{.underline} and replace
fossil fuel consumption through renewable pathways, and those
technologies have received widespread support \[54\]; [however, re‐ cent
studies indicate that in large‐scale deployments, depending on
placement, the near surface changes to albedo and atmospheric conditions
may produce net‐warming]{.underline} \[55\], disruptions of local
climate patterns \[56\], reduction of wind speeds \[57\], and a loss of
pre‐ cipitative transport inland \[58\]. By some indications, wind farms
may "need to operate for more than a century before the warming effect
over the Continental US caused by turbine‐ atmosphere interactions would
be smaller than the reduced warming effect from lowering emissions"
\[56\]. In addition to failing to mitigate carbon production, these
studies highlight that mit‐ igation efforts hold the potential to alter
agriculture, water availability, the frequency, in‐ tensity, and
duration of natural hazards, and a range of other issues that have the
ability to amplify climate challenges and could increase the potential
for conflict. Concerns over the understudied or poorly understood
consequences of geoengineering have already led to push back from some
Indigenous groups in the Arctic. In March of 2021, the Saami Council,
representing the Saami (Sámi) people, wrote an open letter to the
Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) Advisory
Committee, which is part of a project by Harvard University attempting
to test stratospheric aerosol injection technol‐ ogy in Sweden \[59\].
The letter voiced several issues, including the potential for termina‐
tion shock, "irreversible sociopolitical effects", and concerns that the
team did not "have any representation from the intended host country".
Citing concerns from the Saami Council and environmental groups,
Sweden's space agency cancelled the flights that would have been the
first active test of aerosol injection technology \[60\]. These
challenges further highlight the need for an inclusive risk governance
approach, to ensure stake‐ holder concerns are a component in the design
and deployment of eventual intervention methods. Additionally, such an
approach would provide a mechanism to communicate risk more effectively
between groups.

Risks of Geoengineering,"

[Habitat loss]{.underline} [and degradation have long been understood to
be key drivers of declining biodiversity]{.underline}.12
[The]{.underline} land- and [water-use changes required to implement
geoengineering technologies at a]{.underline} climatically [significant
scale would exacerbate these driver]{.underline}s, impacting many
ecosystems and biodiversity both terrestrially and across water systems,
[in the name of pursuing highly speculative technologies that do nothing
to tackle the root causes of the climate crisis]{.underline}. This
section explores the likely direct and indirect impacts of 14
geoengineering technologies on biodiversity. It is important to note
that while we have categorized the technologies based on their area of
intended intervention --- marine, terrestrial, atmosphere-based
geoengineering --- the harms caused by various techniques frequently
cross multiple ecosystems and are not confined solely to their area of
deployment. The intention of geoengineering is to affect large or even
planetary-scale changes to Earth's systems, which, of course, ultimately
lead to transboundary ecosystem impacts. Atmosphere-based geoengineering
technologies would have far-reaching, global impacts on biodiversity
across all biomes. Deployment of solar radiation management (SRM)
technologies would introduce novel risks associated with light dimming
and the threat of termination shock, putting biodiversity and ecosystem
functions at risk of suffering irreversible damages.13 Simulations show
that even if light dimming --- which describes the effect of Earth
receiving less solar radiation --- were globally perfectly uniform using
stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), surface temperatures would not
uniformly fall to either preindustrial or current conditions at the
regional level.14 SAI-induced dimming would reduce the temperature
gradient between the equator and the poles, resulting in excess cooling
in the tropics, excess warming in the poles, or both compared to
existing conditions.15 This is significant as it signals that even if
planetary cooling were achieved, ecosystems would still experience the
adverse effects of regional temperature changes, decreasing their
long-term resilience. [Marine cloud brightening]{.underline} (MCB) [is
expected to]{.underline} also [result in unevenly distributed
temperature shifts]{.underline}, ultimately altering the land-sea
temperature gradient.16 [Doing so would]{.underline} likely
significantly [impact]{.underline} several of [Earth's
subsystems]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} shifts in mean annual
precipitation patterns, **[increased warming in the
Arctic]{.underline}** and Antarctic, uneven terrestrial warming, and
marine cooling.17 [These effects are likely to stress
ecosystems]{.underline}, [putting them further in danger of reaching
their tipping points]{.underline} and undermining their ability to keep
us in the Holocene. [As a result of]{.underline} uneven cooling and
[physical harms caused to micro marine life during the pumping of
seawater]{.underline}, [MCB would also modify food webs]{.underline}
through harm to primary producers and alter the vertical structure of
the water column, [likely making ocean stratification more
pronounced]{.underline}, [thereby leading to changes in the ocean's
biogeochemical cycling with consequences for carbon sequestration and
oxygen cycling that are not yet understood]{.underline}.18

This funding would be used to support a multi-disciplinary research
program, encompassing atmospheric science, climate modelling, aerosol
technology, and environmental ethics. Key research areas would include
the development of advanced aerosol injection technologies, the
refinement of climate models to simulate MCB effects, and the assessment
of potential [[impacts on local ecosystems and weather
patterns]{.underline}.]{.mark} Additionally, the funding would support
field experiments in the Arctic, providing critical data on the
real-world performance of MCB and helping to build public and political
support for the technique.

It is important not to confuse carbon dioxide removal and solar
geoengineering, two very different approaches, under the umbrella term
"geoengineering." Carbon dioxide removal as a climate solution has been
largely embraced, as the risk of unintended consequences is considered
minimal. [Solar geoengineering]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[presents a variety of complicating issues]{.underline}. For example,
despite research on the matter, [a consensus does not yet exist around
the ultimate overall climate impact of techniques like strategic aerosol
injection. Some alarming models have predicted that certain schemes
would cause droughts for a significant portion of the earth's
population]{.underline}. Additionally, [some predict the injection of
aerosols into the atmosphere to cause increased depletion of the ozone
layer]{.underline}. A long list of potential environmental complications
like these exists in addition to complications that have not even been
considered. [Artificially lowering global temperatures via solar
geoengineering also presents the unique risk of "termination
shock]{.underline}," meaning that [if]{.underline} deployment of
[such]{.underline} geoengineering [technology were suddenly
discontinued, the resulting abrupt warming could become even more
catastrophic than if warming had simply continued on its previous
trajector]{.underline}y. [Unpredictable events such as terrorist
attacks, natural disasters, or political action all create risk for the
sudden discontinuation of solar geoengineering and thus risk of
termination shock]{.underline}.

[([CO2]{.mark})]{.underline} [emissions]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} nigh,
with emissions [on track]{.mark} [to peak by 2025]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to Rystad Energy research and analysis. [On the current global
pathway]{.underline} of announced policies, projects, industry trends
and expected technological advancements, global [CO2 emissions are
poised to hit]{.underline} about 39 gigatonnes per year (Gtpa) in 2025
before settling into [a steady annual decline as industries clean up
their carbon footprint]{.underline}. Emissions hit a record high in 2022
as countries scrambled to secure reliable, affordable fuel for power
generation on the back of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a result,
many turned to more carbon-intensive fuels as a short-term solution to
their energy security crises, reviving mothballed coal plants and
prioritizing gas over cleaner alternatives. While these fuels will still
have a role to play in the global economy for decades to come,
[[the]{.mark} broader [push]{.mark} towards a cleaner future [is showing
**no signs of slowing down**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a sign of things
to come, direct CO2 emissions -- carbon dioxide originating from fossil
fuel combustion at the plants worldwide -- from power and heat
generation will peak this year. The decline will be minimal initially
before gathering momentum in the coming years, becoming a significant
factor behind the decrease in total CO2 emissions from all sectors by
2025. ["[Peak]{.mark}]{.underline} fossil fuel CO2
[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} within the next two years [[is
a]{.mark}n outstanding **[global achievement]{.mark}**]{.underline},
exceptional when considering the current supply chain roadblocks and the
high focus on energy security. [If the industry can maintain this
momentum, [global warming of less than 2.0 degrees Celsius **is within
reach**."]{.mark}]{.underline} -- (Artem Abramov, head of clean tech
research at Rystad Energy). Fossil CO2 emissions reached an all-time
high of about 38.3 Gtpa last year, raising eyebrows and questions about
the world's ability to deliver on ambitious climate goals to limit
warming to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius. However,
[[our]{.underline}]{.mark} [comprehensive]{.underline} emissions
[[modeling points to an]{.mark} imminent emissions [inflection
point]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our data shows a peak of 39 Gtpa in 2025,
but that timeline could move up to as early as next year if the
short-term macroeconomic outlook accelerates the energy transition. Last
year proved a challenging one for global climate goals. On the one hand,
a record amount of new utility-scale solar and wind capacity was added
-- about 300 gigawatts (GW) globally -- triggering a sizeable increase
in renewable-generated electricity, a trend that is likely to increase
again this year. However, these new installations were weaker than
forecast, thanks to low-carbon supply-chain disruptions and inflationary
pressure. Moreover, Russia's invasion of Ukraine fundamentally disrupted
energy flows, resulting in widespread natural gas shortages,
particularly in Europe, facilitating the increase in coal use for power
generation. As a result, direct fossil CO2 emissions from the power and
heat sectors hit record highs of around 14.4 Gtpa. Global industrial
emissions (process and direct use of fossil fuels for energy generation
purposes at industrial facilities) last year stayed flat at \~9.95 Gtpa
as post-Covid recovery in China was offset by a visible decline in
Chinese industrial carbon intensity. Transport emissions increased by
0.2 Gtpa to reach 7.8 Gtpa in 2022 -- falling short of pre-Covid peaks
of 8.2 Gtpa due to the continued weakness of the aviation sector,
triggered by the pandemic and accelerating penetration of electric
vehicles (EVs). EV adoption is approaching the levels needed to offset
the annual global growth of the size of the active car fleet. Despite
these setbacks, [[the power and heating sector]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[expected to drive the]{.mark} upcoming fossil CO2 [decline]{.mark} from
mid-decade onwards.]{.underline} In 2023, the addition of renewable
generation capacity is projected to outstrip the uptick in electricity
demand. [[From 2025, annual renewable generation]{.mark} additions
[will]{.mark} [start]{.mark} materially [affecting]{.mark} total [fossil
fuel output]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[This]{.mark} trend [will]{.mark}
also [accompany]{.mark} [continuous coal-to-gas
switching]{.mark}]{.underline} (the persistent trend established several
decades ago net of occasional short-term disruptions). [[Transportation
and industrial emissions]{.mark} will peak later this decade but [are
also]{.mark} [expected to join the decarbonization trend]{.mark} in the
second half of the 2020s]{.underline}. At the same time, [[the
first]{.mark} [generation of]{.mark} large-scale [commercial carbon
capture initiatives will]{.mark} also [start]{.mark} [playing]{.mark}
[non-negligible roles]{.mark}]{.underline}, driven initially by projects
in Europe and North America.

#### Geoengineering deployment will gut support for decarbonization 

Alex **Luhn**, 5/20/**25**, Scientific American, "Inside the Bold
Geoengineering Work to Refreeze the Arctic's Disappearing Ice,"

mm

As global fossil-fuel emissions keep rising, [attitudes about
[geoengineering]{.mark} are starting to change]{.underline}. Two weeks
before I arrived in Cambridge Bay I went to an annual Arctic science
conference at the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco. Frederik Paulsen, a
Swedish pharmaceutical billionaire in a tailored suit and rimless
glasses, took the podium. Though not a scientist, Paulsen was the first
person to reach all eight poles---the geographic, geomagnetic, magnetic
and least accessible poles of each hemisphere---and was onboard one of
the two submersibles that planted a Russian flag on the North Pole
seabed in 2007. In 2023, while flying over Greenland in an ultralight
aircraft, Paulsen was startled to notice that the once brilliant ice
sheet was turning darker as less fresh snow fell. He said he decided
only "more drastic solutions" could avoid catastrophic climate impacts,
given our failure to rein in fossil fuels. It's not enough to just study
climate, he scolded the scientists. "Now is the time to act." The
University of the Arctic, a network of educational institutions that
Paulsen chairs, has rated the feasibility of 61 polar interventions,
from spraying glaciers with ski-resort snow guns to cables that stop
icebergs from drifting south. At the conference, John Moore, a
University of Lapland glaciologist, presented the seabed-curtain idea.
Also there was Fonger Ypma of Arctic Reflections, a Dutch
sea-ice-thickening company that has done field trials in Newfoundland
and Svalbard. Last year he went to Cambridge Bay to learn from Real Ice,
but he hopes to deploy large movable pumping platforms rather than
drones. [The surge of interest [has created a schism in polar
science]{.mark}]{.underline}. In October 2024 [a preprint paper by [42
top glaciologists condemned]{.mark} ice thickening and other [polar
geoengineering techniques]{.mark} as dangerous and
unfeasible]{.underline}. Seabed curtains could disrupt nutrient flows to
CO2-consuming phytoplankton. Spreading tiny glass spheres across
mountain glaciers could decrease the reflectivity of ice covered in
fresh snow. But [[the **overarching concern** is that]{.mark}
[geoengineering]{.mark} [fixes]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
["**[making decarbonization a lot less
attractive]{.underline}**]{.mark}," according to Heidi Sevestre, one of
the paper's authors, who visited an Arctic Reflections trial last year.
[[What they are offering "doesn't attack]{.mark} the cause of the issue,
the [fossil fuels,]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} she says. At the
Monaco conference, Kim Holmén, a Norwegian Polar Institute climate
scientist who has spent more than three decades on Svalbard, the
fastest-warming place on Earth, argued that [[trying to undo the
harms]{.mark} [of]{.mark} our [technology]{.mark} [with]{.mark} even
[more technology was folly]{.mark}.]{.underline} "I make mistakes every
day, you make mistakes every day, [and if we create a system where it
must work every day, it will fail]{.underline}," he said. Critics say
[[it would be more effective to put geoengineering funds toward cutting
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Decarbonization breaks the grip of petrostates -- otherwise inevitable energy wars cause extinction

Dominic **Rohner** **et al., 2023**, Frontiers, "Decentralized green
energy transition promotes peace,"

Two of the biggest challenges faced by humanity, [[climate change and
major]{.mark}]{.underline} episodes of [[political
violence]{.mark},]{.underline} have one thing in common: They [[are
fuelled by oil and gas]{.underline}]{.mark} to which the world has
become increasingly dependent over the last century. The upside of this
dilemma is that if [the [green energy]{.mark} transition]{.underline}
succeeds, it [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[kill two birds with one
stone]{.underline}]{.mark}", as there is an environmental and
geopolitical double dividend of avoiding fossil fuels. The tragedy in
Ukraine unfolding currently in front of our eyes has increased the
political urgency to reduce fossil-fuel dependency. Fossil fuel prices
that have been relatively high in the past months compared to recent
years, especially for fuel types particularly affected by the war, such
as, e.g., natural gas prices in Europe (Federal Research Bank of St,
2020, Garicano et al., 2022), and ever-cheaper renewable energy
technologies provide powerful economic incentives to finally invest in
green energy. Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic can inform
incentives for behaviour change too. Put differently, the current moment
is a unique window of opportunity to engage in a radical transition
towards green energy. In what follows, this piece will first highlight
through what mechanisms [[fossil fuels threaten]{.mark} sustainability
and [peace]{.mark}]{.underline}, and, subsequently, outline in detail
how the green energy transition can concretely be achieved, stressing
both key factors of reducing energy demand and boosting green energy
supply. Several promising [[green energy]{.underline}]{.mark} policies
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be implemented at a local, decentralized
scale, helping to [[avoid]{.mark} the fatal concentration of [resource
rents and political power]{.mark} [that]{.mark} has [led]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} oil and gas [hollowing out democracy,]{.mark} fuelling
[corruption]{.mark} [and triggering civil and interstate
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rapid climate change is a generally accepted
reality, and it is unequivocal that it is a direct consequence of
human-led fossil fuel burning and poor land management. The atmosphere,
ocean and land have already warmed an average of 1.1°C compared to
pre-industrial time. Today, Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) from coal, gas and
oil continue to accumulate and increase global average temperatures at
an alarming rate. What does it mean? Human-induced climate change is
already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region
across the globe. Sea levels increase as well as heatwaves, floods,
droughts, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase in severity and
frequency as temperatures keep rising. Is it too late? It will never be
"too late" to avoid some level of impacts and destruction by reducing
emissions to zero -- but right now, we can still act to avoid the vast
bulk of impacts by limiting the global average temperature increase to
1.5°C. To do so, we need to halve our GHGs emissions by 2030 and reach
global net zero emissions by 2050. How can we do it? The first and most
obvious step to reach this goal is to commit, starting today, to stop
extracting, trading, transforming and using fossil fuels (IPCC et al.,
2022). Decades of research in political science and economics have
assembled a long list of detrimental effects of fossil fuel and mineral
extraction. [Petrostates are characterised by lower levels of democracy,
more corruption, and more economic instability]{.underline} (Ross,
2012). [One of [the underlying mechanisms]{.mark} at work [is]{.mark}
that [the appeal of]{.mark}]{.underline} grabbing the
[[windfalls]{.underline}]{.mark} of mother nature's riches attracts a
type of rent-seeking politician and leads to lower state accountability
[[and a rentier stat]{.mark}e]{.underline} (as much of the fiscal budget
is financed by royalties of natural resources rather than by income
taxes, the regime in place has lower incentives to content citizens and
invest in public services, infrastructure, education and sectors beyond
the extractive one). The lucrative fossil-fuel rents also represent an
attractive "prize" to be appropriated by rebel leaders aiming to get
their hands on the precious resources. [[This has led to **a strong
statistical relationship**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} oil or mineral
discoveries or [prize spikes fuelling]{.mark} the risk of [civil
wars]{.mark} (]{.underline}Ross, 2012), (Watts, 2004), (Heinberg, 2005),
(Berman et al., 2017). In many circumstances multinationals also
contribute to the institutionalised theft of a country's riches by
kleptocrats. In particular, mineral extraction has a specially strong
detrimental impact on peace when mines are owned by companies with low
corporate social responsibility and when the sector escapes traceability
and transparency initiatives (Berman et al., 2017). Further,
[[dictatorships]{.mark} [built]{.mark} [on
petrodollars]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[have a]{.mark}]{.underline}
greater [[tendency to commit mass atrocities]{.mark} targeted against
their citizens]{.underline}. As shown in the game-theoretic setting and
empirical analysis of (Esteban et al., 2015), when a cynical dictator
draws riches mainly from lucrative oil contracts that do not require
much local labour, her/his incentives to physically eliminate opposition
groups are larger than when the economy hinges on complex, human-capital
intensive production outside the commodity sector. Finally, [[there
is]{.mark} also [**strong statistical evidence** that interstate wars
are fuelled by]{.mark} the "[black gold]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Caselli
et al., 2015). First of all, [[petrostates]{.underline}]{.mark}
over-proportionally [[give birth to dictatorships]{.mark},
[which]{.mark} are [more likely to start wars]{.mark}]{.underline}
against democracies and autocracies alike. Indeed, [[as shown
by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} famous ["[democratic
peace]{.mark}"]{.underline} result, democracies are extremely unlikely
to attack other democracies militarily. Put differently, **[a decisive
way in which [fossil fuels push our world towards Armageddon]{.mark} is
[by increasing the share of non-democracies in the international
system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Beyond this mechanism, [[fossil fuels are
drivers of interstate wars]{.mark} [by]{.mark} providing [countries with
incentives]{.mark} for trying [to capture a neighbouring country's
resources]{.mark}]{.underline} (Caselli et al., 2015).

### 2NC - ! -- Ocean Acidification

#### Decarbonization is key to stop ocean acidification -- we are on the brink of total ecosystem collapse

Lisa **Bachelor**, 6/9/**25**, The Guardian, "Ticking timebomb: sea
acidity has reached critical levels, threatening entire ecosystems -
study,"
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/sea-acidity-ecosystems-ocean-acidification-planetary-health-scientists?utm_source=chatgpt.com,

[The world's [oceans]{.mark}]{.underline} are in worse health than
realised, scientists have said today, as they warn that a key
measurement shows we [[are "running out of time]{.underline}]{.mark}" to
protect marine ecosystems. [Ocean [acidification]{.mark}]{.underline},
often called the "evil twin" of the climate crisis, [[is caused when
carbon dioxide is rapidly absorbed]{.mark} by the ocean]{.underline},
where it reacts with water molecules leading to a fall in the pH level
of the seawater. It damages coral reefs and other ocean habitats and, in
extreme cases, can dissolve the shells of marine creatures. [Until now,
ocean acidification had not been deemed to have crossed its "planetary
boundary]{.underline}". The planetary boundaries are the natural limits
of key global systems -- such as climate, water and wildlife diversity
-- beyond which their ability to maintain a healthy planet is in danger
of failing. Six of the nine had been crossed already, scientists said
last year. [However, [a new study]{.mark}]{.underline} by the UK's
Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), the Washington-based National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and Oregon State University's
Co-operative Institute for Marine Resources Studies [[found that]{.mark}
ocean acidification's "boundary" was also reached]{.underline} about
five years ago. ["[Ocean acidification]{.mark}]{.underline} isn't just
an environmental crisis -- it **[[is a ticking
timebomb]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for marine ecosystems and coastal
economies]{.underline}," said PML's Prof Steve Widdicombe, who is also
co-chair of the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network. The study
drew on new and historical physical and chemical measurements from ice
cores, combined with advanced computer models and studies of marine
life, which gave the scientists an overall assessment of the past 150
years. [It found that [by 2020 the average ocean condition worldwide
was]{.mark} already [very close to]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and in some
regions beyond -- [[the planetary boundary]{.mark} for ocean
acidification]{.underline}. This is defined as when the concentration of
calcium carbonate in seawater is more than 20% below preindustrial
levels. The deeper in the ocean they looked, the worse the findings
were, the scientists said. At 200 metres below the surface, 60% of
global waters had breached the "safe" limit for acidification. "Most
ocean life doesn't just live at the surface," said PML's Prof Helen
Findlay. "The waters below are home to many more different types of
plants and animals. Since these deeper waters are changing so much, [the
impacts of ocean acidification could be far worse than we
thought]{.underline}." This had, she added, huge implications for
important underwater ecosystems such as tropical and even deep-sea coral
reefs that provided essential habitats and nursery grounds for the young
of many species. As pH levels drop, calcifying species such as corals,
oysters, mussels and tiny molluscs known as sea butterflies struggle to
maintain their protective structures, leading to weaker shells, slower
growth, reduced reproduction and decreased survival rates. The authors
underlined that **[[decreasing CO2 emissions was the only way to deal
with acidification globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but that
conservation measures could and should focus on the regions and species
that were most vulnerable. Jessie Turner, director of the International
Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, who was not involved in the
study, said: "This report makes it clear: we are running out of time and
what we do -- or fail to do -- now is already determining our future.
"**[[We are coming to terms with an existential
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** while grappling with the difficult reality
that much suitable habitat for key species has already been lost. It's
clear that governments can no longer afford to overlook acidification in
mainstream policy agendas," she said.

The oceans of the Earth can exist without us. If we humans become
extinct, they won't even notice we're gone. [[We]{.mark}, however,
**simply [cannot exist]{.mark}** [without]{.mark} our [oceans]{.mark}.
We need them. [They are the]{.mark} **primary [life support
system]{.mark}** [on Earth]{.mark}, the **lungs**, **climate
regulator**, and ultimate **food factory**]{.underline} - connected
deeply to each of us and nearly every economic activity that makes our
world go round. For those old enough to remember - and for the young and
curious, too - you may know "Earthrise," the iconic photograph taken on
24 December, 1968 by a 35-year-old American astronaut and engineer named
William Anders as he looked through a small, frosty window of Apollo 8,
the first spacecraft to leave Earth's gravity and orbit the moon. From
380,000km away, our spectacular planet appeared as a vulnerable, mostly
blue sphere, vividly illustrating their size and importance -- they
cover some 70% of the Earth with an average depth of four kilometers.
Since then, we've explored just 10% of our oceans' contents. We've
learnt they provide 99% of the Earth's living space and contain around
80% of all living organisms. They are the largest space in our universe
known to be inhabited by organisms. [[They provide]{.underline}]{.mark}
our [Earth with a moist, livable climate, full of
[oxygen]{.mark}]{.underline} from trillions of microscopic plants
floating like tiny stars in a watery, immense universe, producing close
to 100 million tons of food each year, enough to provide one in every
four or five people with their daily protein. [They are]{.underline}
also [[crucial to]{.mark} our **[climate]{.mark} system**]{.underline}.
There is more heat stored in the first 10 feet of the ocean than in the
entire atmosphere. This is significant because heat is transferred from
the atmosphere to the ocean. Then currents move heat throughout the
ocean and across the planet. The gulf stream, an intense warm current,
is the major source of north-south heat transfer in the Atlantic. It
starts in the Gulf of Mexico, snakes around Florida, and then goes
northeast across the Atlantic, expanding like a funnel until it gets to
Europe. The heat transferred by this "river within an ocean" brings a
mild, moist, warm climate to Europeans. The gulf stream moves this heat
at a speed 300 times the average speed of the Amazon, and at a volume
greater than all rivers in the world, combined. Without the gulf stream,
England would be like Alaska and upper Norway would resemble Antarctica.
But for all its might, the gulf stream is fragile and could change, or
even shut down within 10 years if we keep heating our planet the way we
are, disrupting the exquisite balance of this unusual oceanographic
phenomena. By any measure, scientific or anecdotal, the global ocean
makes Earth a nice place for us all to live. [If you want to see what
the Earth might be like without an ocean there are plenty of examples in
our own solar system]{.underline}. President John F. Kennedy once said:
"Why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea? It's because we
all came from there \... and when we go back \... we are going back from
whence we came." He was also correct in his prediction that the United
States would land people on the moon within 10 years, and that the 1960s
would be the "Decade of the Oceans." Sadly, in spite of the birth of
modern oceanography, our oceans did not garner anywhere near the same
budget and attention as space exploration. We looked up instead of
taking note of the trouble brewing right beneath our noses, along our
shores and under our docks. Since the 1970s, a lot of damage was done
when countries all over the world developed their coastal areas,
destroying reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves along the way. Our
population grew from four to over seven billion people, and as the
middle class expanded so did consumption, especially in the realm of
oil, coal and natural gas development. Newly minted fleets of fishing
boats depleting most of our wild stocks of edible ocean life. We
polluted our oceans with agricultural runoff, oil, plastic and other
synthetic chemicals. The time is now Through the thousands of dives I
conducted during this period in all five oceans, I had a front row seat
to this seemingly endless destruction. Fortunately, this is changing.
Countries all over the world now understand that the blue planet, as
Anders saw it from the Apollo spaceship nearly 50 years ago, is an ocean
planet, and it's on us to make sure we never forget that. So don't.
Three landmark agreements in 2015 give us the international framework we
need for action. The Paris climate summit acknowledged that if we are to
understand and solve climate change, oceans must be part of the
equation. There was renewed evidence of the governance of the 'High
Seas' -- the area beyond any national jurisdiction. And the UN also
adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 14 focuses on conserving
our oceans. This makes 2015 the most important year in the history of
the world as far as committing to take collective action on the global
ocean. It should be clear to anyone concerned with the health of our
civilization that our past connection to the ocean is ripe and ready to
connect with a future vision; one that is fully awake to the reality
that if we are to continue occupying this planet in balance with nature
we must pay attention to the oceans - now.
[[Conserving]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[oceans -- and **through
them**]{.mark} **our [own survival]{.mark}** [-- is]{.mark} now more
[possible]{.mark} than ever]{.underline}. It will need to include all
stakeholders -- governments, businesses, citizens, technology
developers, and indigenous populations. We are all stakeholders of the
oceans and we all have something to contribute. Indigenous communities
have a deep knowledge of oceans based on empirical information as old as
humanity itself. For example, Aborigines in present-day Australia living
alongside the ocean discovered what time of year particular coral reef
fish are most nutritious and not reproducing, which becomes the best
time of year to harvest and eat them. This is a time-tested, perfect
system, which marine biologists and nutritionists knew nothing about
until recently. We also need the innovation that well-funded, modern
science can provide. We are in the midst of what some call the \"Fourth
Industrial Revolution\", one that embraces big data, apps, and unbridled
creativity. Initiatives like Global Fishing Watch are increasing
transparency and giving data access to ordinary people -- on their
mobile phones and in real time! I am encouraged by the optimistic
millennials who intend to change the world through approaches so new we
have no idea what they are. Our oceans need a renaissance This is our
moment. It's what I call the "Ocean Renaissance" -- a moment where
technology meets tradition, where fishermen become scientists, where
scientists become policy makers, where policy makers become
anthropologists and where anthropologists learn the ways of the oceans
from cultures like the Aborigines or Pacific Islanders, who live a
symbiotic life with the ocean. The conversation will continue at the UN
climate conference in Morocco this month. Even if you cannot attend, you
can watch a livestream feed on the U.N. website, you can read about what
happens there, and you can do something with your newfound education.
Our collective actions now impact the health of the ocean. The effect of
global industry, commerce and the lifestyle choices of more than seven
billion people is affecting our oceans. We have a choice. We can degrade
the salty water that covers most of our planet or we can steward it in a
way that enables it to take care of us. [[Without healthy
oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}, our [[life on Earth would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} severely challenged, unpleasant and perhaps
[**[impossible]{.mark}**. The [oceans are]{.mark} the **[life
support]{.mark} system** of all living beings]{.underline}. That's
because **[[life on Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}** can thrive without
land, but it [[**cannot** exist without an ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### UQ -- Decarbonization Now

#### The U.S. is successfully decarbonizing its economy now -- growth has become decoupled from GHG emissions

Roger **Pielke**, 6/16/**25**, American Enterprise Institute, "The Most
Amazing Climate Policy Figure,"
https://www.aei.org/articles/the-most-amazing-climate-policy-figure/, mm

[You'd be hard pressed to find a more fascinating straight
line.]{.underline} The figure below is one of the most amazing graphs in
all of climate policy.1 It shows the decarbonization of the U.S. economy
from 1992 to 2025 --- with decarbonization is defined as the ratio of
carbon dioxide emissions (from fossil fuels) to GDP (in 2025\$).
![](media/image6.png){width="3.810721784776903in"
height="3.0876246719160103in"} I was motivated to update this time
series after reading the best analysis of recent U.S. climate policy
that I've seen, by Ted Nordhaus of The Breakthrough Institute. Ted's
entire, detailed analysis is well worth your time, but the part that
sent me off making graphs was this: The wild swings of energy policies
from Democratic to Republican administrations beg the question of
whether the United States is capable of sustaining any coherent energy
policy, whether in service of climate mitigation or energy dominance.
And yet, [despite]{.underline} all of that political and [policy
volatility, the US over recent decades has both managed to sustain a
significant and consistent rate of decarbonization while establishing
its energy economy]{.underline} as the envy of much of the world. [What
makes the U.S. decarbonization rate remarkable is]{.underline} that it
is (a) not an explicit focus as a policy metric, (b) few people pay
attention to it (you'll see decarbonization discussed more here at THB
than most anywhere), and, (c) U.S. politics and energy policy has indeed
been subject to "wild swings" over the past 30+ years. And yet, with all
that, [the linear decline]{.underline}. Consider another remarkable
graph. The figure below shows, for 1992 to 2025, a scatterplot of U.S.
GDP versus U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.
![](media/image7.png){width="6.320298556430446in"
height="2.6732042869641295in"} The graph shows that from 1992 to 2005,
increasing GDP was fairly tightly coupled to increasing emissions of
carbon dioxide. Then, in [about 2006]{.underline}, things changed ---
since then, [GDP has been decoupled from emissions of carbon
dioxide]{.underline} --- [GDP has continued to increase as emissions
fall.]{.underline} Decarbonization results from the net effects of
decreasing carbon intensity of energy consumption and/or decreasing
energy intensity of the economy. We can make some sense of causality
with the figure below, which shows from 2006 the change in U.S.
consumption of coal, natural gas, and renewables.3
![](media/image8.png){width="3.1214862204724407in"
height="2.1605839895013124in"} The figure shows that [from 2006 to 2024,
coal consumption decreased rapidly]{.underline}, and by slightly less
than the combined increase in natural gas and renewables. [Natural gas
consumption increased]{.underline} dramatically due largely to
technologies such as fracking and horizontal drilling, along with
learning through implementation by the private sector. Because natural
gas has about half the carbon intensity of coal, and renewables much
less, [these]{.underline} consumption [trends contributed to emissions
going down]{.underline} even as economic activity increased by about 25%
(after inflation). How long can decarbonization continue based on
replacing coal with less carbon intensive generation? The figure below
gives us a sense of the answer.
![](media/image9.png){width="4.200164041994751in"
height="2.532846675415573in"} The figure shows that the decline of coal
has been just about linear since about 2006. [If that trend were to
continue, then the U.S. would be coal-free by the early 2030s,
suggesting that the linear rate of U.S. decarbonization could continue
for the rest of the decade without a significant departure from recent
energy trends]{.underline}. However, at some point the decline of coal
will stop --- either because the U.S. has exited coal or the decreasing
trend in coal consumption of the past decade is stopped or reversed. At
that point, if the decades-long systematic decarbonization of the U.S.
economy is to continue, then some other dynamic will have to kick in.
Some concluding thoughts: We do not fully understand the linear rate of
decarbonization over the past three decades --- What dynamics have
modulated this trend such that it has been so consistent? If we
understood that trend better, we'd be better positioned to understand
what it would take to keep it going; If we kept that decarbonization
trend going, the U.S. would hit "net zero" carbon dioxide emissions in
the middle of the second half of the century, approximately consistent
with the Paris Agreement's 2 degrees Celsius temperature target;4
Climate policy focused on deep decarbonization does not have to
characterize energy policy through the rest of the century --- it needs
instead to focus primarily on how to maintain, if not accelerate, rates
of decarbonization of recent decades for the next few decades; The U.S.
case shows that technological advancement is essential for maintaining
historical rates of decarbonization; So long as coal is on the grid,
natural gas is a bridge fuel --- Expanded nuclear electricity generation
would seem to be a no-brainer, for many reasons, and may in future
decades contribute to greater decarbonization; The U.S. natural gas boom
starting in the 2000s resulted from decisions made in the public and
private sectors (and in collaboration) since the 1970s. Energy policy
outcomes do not conform to electoral calendars; A question that should
be asked: Has U.S. climate policy since 1992 even mattered for
decarbonization? Or have steps that result in maintaining historical
rates of decarbonization been recharacterized as climate policy? A focus
on decarbonization has another benefit --- pretty much everyone values
economic growth, emissions reductions, or both. [Based on the historical
data, I'd hypothesize that economic growth and decarbonization are
actually **inter-related, and mutually reinforcing**]{.underline}.

#### Global decarbonization efforts are speeding up -- that will keep us under 2 degrees of warming

Ian **Stannard**, August **2024**, ICE, "Global decarbonization gaining
momentum?",

[Globally, the numbers of companies publishing]{.underline} temperature
targets and making emission reduction plans, such [as Net Zero 2050
commitments, has continued to increase]{.underline}. But is there any
evidence to suggest these commitments are having an impact on global
corporate emissions? [Our analysis]{.underline} using the ICE Global
Emissions and Targets Database to track global corporate emissions
[suggests there are positive signs.]{.underline} [We found improvement
in both the quality of data being reported and the trend in global
emission intensities, and absolute emissions globally]{.underline}.
Overall, [evidence points to the trend of global corporate
decarbonization **gaining momentum**]{.underline} in the last reporting
year. To carry out a detailed analysis and to examine progress on a
like-for-like basis we created a global diversified portfolio of
companies reporting complete Scope 1 and 2 emissions and at least one
category of Scope 3 emissions for at least the past two years (sample of
2,005 companies). The global average emission intensity (tCO2e/\$m
revenue) reduction for this sample portfolio is an impressive 30%
year-on-year for Scope 1 and 2 and 24% year-on-year for Scope 3 for the
last reporting year. Screening the portfolio for companies that also
publish a verified SBTi temperature target (sample 668 companies)
produces further interesting results. While the rate of emission
intensity reduction is not quite as steep for Scope 1 and 2 in the
latest reporting year at 26% year-on-year, the Scope 3 intensity decline
is 31% year-on-year. Overall average intensity levels for companies with
SBTi targets continue to be significantly below the average of the
broader sample portfolio, particularly for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
These results are consistent with previous ICE research which found
companies with temperature targets tend to report lower intensities and
overall faster decarbonization rates than their peers without targets1.
In terms of absolute emissions (by EVIC), the declining trend is also
evident for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, for both the overall portfolio and
the SBTi screen portfolio. For Scope 3 absolute emissions the picture is
more complex. While there is no clear trend observed for overall Scope 3
emissions in recent years, we note divergent trends between the upstream
(declining) and downstream (rising) Scope 3 emissions for our sample
portfolio, a dynamic we will explore further in following articles.
Regional variations are also interesting. [European
companies]{.underline} on average [report the lowest emission
intensity]{.underline} for both Scope 1 and 2, and Scope 3 emissions,
[with continued strong decarbonization trends]{.underline} evident in
the latest data. At the other end of the scale, North American companies
have traditionally reported higher emission intensities, but here we are
finding encouraging trends emerging. In recent years, average Scope 1
and 2 emission intensities reported by North American companies have
fallen significantly. Average emission intensities reported by North
American companies are now aligned with the global average. However, it
is Scope 3 emission intensities where the most significant change
appears to be taking place. While average Scope 3 emission intensities
reported by North American companies remain the highest globally, these
have fallen dramatically and are now closing the gap with the rest of
the world. An assessment of the portfolio (before applying the SBTi
filter) using ICE's Net Zero Analysis tools, show 90% of companies in
the portfolio have published temperature targets (both verified and
unverified by SBTi). [Our analysis finds the portfolio is aligned to
the]{.underline} NGFS Phase IV [Net Zero 2050 scenario]{.underline}
until 2026, when some divergence starts to take place, giving an Implied
Temperature Rise (ITR) of 2.18 degrees C. [Applying the]{.underline}
SBTi \[[Science Based Targets initiative]{.underline}\] [filter improves
the performance further, taking the ITR down to 1.94 degrees
C]{.underline}. This is an improvement from 2.44 degrees C and 2.29
degrees C, respectively in the previous reporting year and is consistent
with the percentage reduction in the divergence of the portfolio
cumulative emissions from their Net Zero pathway.

#### The US has been actively [increasing]{.underline} its energy transition efforts.

Sami **Ulla and** Rundong **Luo,** 8/**23**, ScienceDirect, \[Sami Ulla
is a professor of biogeochemistry and geography at University of
Birmingham, and Rundong Luo is a professor of human resources and labor

energy transition in the United States through the lens of green energy
innovations, natural resources and environmental policy,"

The United States (US) is recognized as a major contributor to
greenhouse gas emissions globally, due to its extensive resource
utilization. However, sustainable development can be achieved with the
advent of technological advancements, resource management, and effective
environmental policy. This study evaluates the role of green energy
innovations (GENI), natural resources (NRSS), and environmental policy
(ENPY) in forecasting green growth and energy transition in the US. A
recently introduced Fourier quantile causality framework is used to
analyze the quarterly data ranges from 1990-Q1 to 2020-Q4. The results
indicate that [GENI, NRSS, and ENPY have **substantial** predictive
capabilities for green growth and **energy transition** in the
US]{.underline}, [particularly in higher quantiles, promoting
sustainable development.]{.underline} Additionally, [ENPY reinforces the
positive impacts of NRSS and GENI on energy transition and green
growth.]{.underline} The study highlights different policy points to
stimulate green growth and energy transition in the US to ensure
sustainable development.

Green growth and energy transition are critical components of achieving
sustainable development goals (SDGs) and ensuring a sustainable future
for our planet (Rahim et al., 2021). The world is facing significant
environmental challenges, such as climate change, resource depletion,
and pollution, which require urgent action (Wei et al., 2023). According
to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy-associated carbon
emissions rose to a historic high of 33.2 gigatons in 2019, contributing
to the growing threat of climate change. However, there is a growing
recognition that transitioning to a low-carbon economy and promoting
green growth can provide significant economic, social, and environmental
benefits (Xie et al., 2022). A report by the IEA found that progressive
climate actions can create about \$26 trillion in economic benefits and
65 million new low-carbon jobs by 2030 (IEA, 2022). Most countries rely
on fossil fuels to meet their energy demands, which causes environmental
degradation and impeding the green growth (Afshan et al., 2022). The
current global economy necessitates a shift towards eco-friendly
practices and countries worldwide are striving to be carbon-free by
using advance technologies to promote green recovery. The green growth
is an essential indicator of a nation\'s ability to accomplish
sustainable development objectives in the long-term (Khan et al.,
2022a). Nonetheless, numerous factors such as technological innovations,
and renewable energy, have a significant impact on green growth (Khan et
al., 2021). It is therefore crucial for governments, businesses, and
individuals to prioritize green growth and energy transition to ensure a
sustainable future for generations to come.

[The US]{.underline} has long been one of the world\'s significant
consumers of energy and natural resources, with soaring economic growth
and industrialization driving significant demand. However, this
consumption has come at a cost, with significant environmental impacts,
including greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and resource depletion
(Zafar et al., 2019). As such, promoting sustainable development and
transitioning to a sustainable/green energy system is crucial for the
US\'s long-term economic and environmental health. However, in recent
years, the country [has made significant strides in **reducing** its
energy and resource consumption while maintaining economic growth.
Between 2005 and 2019, the US **declined** its energy intensity by
**19.1%**]{.underline}, while the economy grew by 25% (Yang et al.,
2021). Additionally, renewable energy has become increasingly
competitive, with the cost of wind and solar power falling rapidly in
recent years. According to a report by the IEA, costs of wind and solar
energy have dropped by 70% and 89% by 2010 in the US, respectively.
These trends demonstrate that economic growth and energy consumption are
not mutually exclusive until the percentage of renewable energy
resources are not integrated in the energy mix. By transitioning to a
more sustainable energy system, the US can mitigate its environmental
effect alongside preserving economic growth. Furthermore, promoting
sustainable development can create new economic opportunities,
particularly in the rapidly growing clean energy sector. As such, it is
crucial that the country continues to prioritize sustainable growth and
energy transition as part of its long-term economic strategy to ensure a
sustainable future.

Among the many other institutional, economic, and financial factors,
green energy innovations are becoming increasingly vital for sustainable
growth and the energy transition (Chen and Lei, 2018). As the world is
facing the severe challenges of climate change, rising energy demands,
and the exhaustion of natural resources, it\'s crucial to find
alternative sources of energy that are renewable and environmentally
friendly (Wei et al., 2023). Green energy innovations, such as wind
turbines, solar panels, and hydroelectric power, provide sustainable
solutions to the world\'s energy needs (Afshan et al., 2022). Innovative
technologies and business models can help to drive down the cost of
renewable energy, increase energy efficiency, and improve energy storage
and distribution systems, thus promoting sustainable development
(Petrariu et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2022). Not only do they reduce
carbon emissions, but they also promote energy independence and create
new economic opportunities including the creation of new industries and
jobs in the rapidly growing clean energy sector (Saleem et al., 2020).
The development and application of green energy innovations have the
ability to transform the process we produce and consume energy, inducing
a sustainable future (Xie et al., 2022). Governments, businesses, and
individuals alike must invest in and promote green energy innovations to
drive the energy transition forward and diminish the influences of
climate change because it is crucial to continue prioritizing their
development and implementation to promote sustainable development
(Ramzan et al., 2022).

Likewise, natural resources are at the core of sustainable growth and
energy transition. The abundance and efficient utilization of natural
resources like wind, hydro, solar, and biomass are crucial in ensuring a
transition to clean and sustainable energy (Jhariya et al., 2022). On
the positive side, natural resources offer a clean and renewable
resource of energy, declining our reliance on non-renewable energy
resources and helping to mitigate climate change (Abbasi et al., 2021;
Lee and He, 2022), which in turn improves public health and helps to
secure a stable environment. Furthermore, natural resources are the key
source of raw material used in producing renewable energy technologies
like wind turbines, batteries, and solar panels (Wang et al., 2021). For
instance, the production of solar panels needs materials like silicon,
glass, and aluminum, while wind turbines require steel and rare earth
metals. However, extracting and using natural resources can have
significant environmental and social impacts. For instance, mining
operations can result in deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution,
and habitat destruction (Mela et al., 2021). Furthermore, producing some
renewable technologies like batteries generate significant amounts of
waste and pollution (Huang, 2022). It is crucial to manage natural
resources\' sustainability and to minimize the climate and social
impacts associated with their extraction, production, and use for a
sustainable growth. In addition, natural resources are finite, and their
availability is not evenly distributed worldwide. This means that there
are geopolitical implications associated with their use, including
issues related to access, control, and distribution (Gyamfi et al.,
2022). To address these challenges, it is important to prioritize
sustainable resource management, promote resource efficiency, and invest
in the development of alternative and more sustainable production
methods.

Environmental policies are also essential for promoting green growth and
facilitating the transition to a sustainable energy structure(Shao et
al., 2021). These policies can help to address some of the most
significant environmental and social challenges facing the world today,
such as climate change, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss
(Dechezleprêtre and Sato, 2017; Ibrahim and Ajide, 2021). At the same
time, the implementation of these policies can also have both favorable
and adverse effects on economic growth, social equity, and individual
behavior. On the positive side, effective environmental policies can
create new economic opportunities in the clean energy sector, generating
employment and supporting local businesses. For instance, policies such
as feed-in tariffs and tax incentives for renewable energy installations
can encourage investment in sustainable technologies and promote
innovation in the clean energy sector (Razzaq et al., 2021).
Furthermore, environmental policies can lead to improved public health
outcomes by reducing air and water pollution and mitigating the impacts
of climate change (Dechezleprêtre and Sato, 2017). However,
environmental policies can also have negative consequences, particularly
for industries that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels or other
non-renewable resources (Borozan, 2018). Such policies can lead to job
losses, particularly in regions where these industries are a significant
source of employment (Dogan et al., 2023). Also, environmental policies
may not always be socially equitable, as the costs of transition may be
disproportionately borne by low-income or marginalized communities
(Bashir et al., 2021). Therefore, it is vital to formulate and implement
environmental policies in a way that balances economic growth, social
equity, and environmental protection.

The US faces significant challenges in achieving sustainable growth and
energy transition while maintaining its position as a global economic
leader. To address these challenges, it is essential to prioritize
innovation in green energy technologies, effective usage of natural
resources, and efficient environmental policies to realize the
sustainable development. Innovation in renewable energy technologies can
provide a foundation for sustainable energy systems while promoting
economic growth. Recent data shows that [in 2022, renewable energy
sources, including wind and solar, provided **24%** of US electricity
generation, up from **10%** in 2010 (EIA, 2023).]{.underline}
Encouragingly, [the US government has announced plans **to invest \$35
billion in clean energy research and development** over the next decade
(IEA, 2022).]{.underline} In addition, [the US]{.underline} has vast
natural resources that can support the transition to a sustainable
energy system, such as solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal. However,
the country also faces significant challenges related to natural
resource management, including the potential environmental impacts of
resource extraction, land use conflicts, and access issues (Zafar et
al., 2019). To overcome these challenges and achieve a sustainable
energy transition, the US needs to execute some sound environmental
policies. For instance, [the country has implemented **a national
renewable energy standard** and **carbon pricing mechanisms**, such as
the **Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative**, which have helped to
**incentivize** the implementation of **renewable technologies and
reduce emissions.**]{.underline} Fig. 1 uncovers the trends of
sustainable growth (SGRW), energy transition (ENGT), green energy
innovations (GENI), natural resources (NRSS), and environmental policy
(ENPY) in the US for the period 1990 to 2020. The figure exposes huge
variations in the sustainable growth of the US across the years;
however, all the factors are seen to have an increasing trend. This
gives us a hint that [the US is significantly **promoting innovations in
green energy, natural resources, and environmental policies** over time,
**progressing towards sustainable growth** and **energy
transition**.]{.underline} Therefore, it is essential to prioritize
green energy innovations, natural resources, and environmental policies,
and this study aims to empirically examine the significance of these
factors for sustainable growth and energy transition in the US while
promoting economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection
to realize sustainable development.

This study offers a significant contribution to the prevailing
literature by examining the dynamics of the relationship between green
energy innovations, natural resources, environmental policy, sustainable
growth, and energy transition in the US. Using a recently developed
Fourier quantile causality test, the study offers unique insights into
the association among these variables at different quantiles, providing
a more detailed and robust understanding of their interactions. This
study is novel in several ways. Firstly, it is the first to examine the
relationship between green energy innovations, natural resources, and
environmental policy with sustainable growth and energy transition in
the US, using a robust econometric technique and the latest data.
Secondly, the study also investigates the moderating influence of
environmental policy on the relationship of green energy innovations and
natural resources with sustainable growth and energy transition, which
have not been taken into consideration previously. Finally, the study
has used a Fourier quantile causality test in conjunction with spectrum
analysis, allowing for the investigation of causal links among the
variables in short-, medium-, and long-term based on different
quantiles. This test has yielded reliable outcomes since it considers
structural breakdowns, quantity, position, and shape that are not needed
to predetermine. The technique employed in this study is innovative, and
it provides policymakers with valuable information on the actual
magnitude of each covariate, helping to develop suitable policies for
sustainable growth and energy transition in the US economy. The outcomes
from the [**empirical analysis** revealed **a positive role** of natural
resources, green energy innovations, and environmental policy in
promoting green growth and energy transition in the US.]{.underline}
More importantly, [an efficient environmental policy strengthens the
influence of green energy innovations and natural resources on green
growth and energy transition, ensuring the significance of these factors
for a sustainable future in the US.]{.underline} These results provide
policymakers with valuable insights into the most effective policies and
strategies to promote sustainable development.

[Despite warnings of a slowdown, solutions continue to race
forward]{.underline}. As cleantech becomes cheaper than ever, [2024 saw
record uptake in renewable energy]{.underline}, electric vehicles (EVs),
and more. [These positive tipping points are happening
worldwide]{.underline} --- with major progress in China and the Global
South. Let's review what that means for the year ahead. Costs falling
fast. Solar module prices fell 35 percent to 9 cents per watt; EV
batteries are now below \$100/kWh and often at cost parity with their
fossil-fueled competition. Cleantech growing globally. Solar additions
grew to 600 GW, EV sales climbed 25 percent, and battery storage
additions nearly doubled. Changing perception. [IEA forecasts have
improved for cleantech and fallen for fossil fuels]{.underline} several
years in a row. New year, new progress? Energy efficiency and methane
are the two fastest ways to cut warming, but also the two furthest off
track.From ambition to action. With national climate plans due in
February, it is time to include all sectors, pollutants, and solutions
--- and then hit the ground running.After 2024, clean energy is cheaper
than ever. Global solar module prices fell 35 percent to less than 9
cents/kWh. EV batteries saw their best price decline in seven years,
dropping \~30--50 percent for cathodes and 20 percent for the full
battery to below \$100/kWh. EVs are now at cost-of-ownership parity in
the United States and purchase price parity in China --- with that
milestone expected around now for Europe, in 2026 for the United States,
and in 2027 for India's two- and four-wheelers. Thankfully, lower cost
does not mean lower quality. Take batteries: the average cell in 2024
used less than half as much nickel and cobalt as a decade ago, and new
technologies could double energy densities in the next five years. As we
see improving safety, charge time, and longevity, uptake will follow and
drive down cost in a virtuous cycle. [Cleantech uptake is more
widespread than ever.]{.underline} Renewable energy additions grew 17
percent with a record \~600 GW of solar, \~125 GW of wind, and
near-doubling of grid storage installations to \~170 GWh in 2024.
Renewables now outpace fossil electricity investment by 10 to 1, with
more investment in solar than all other power sources combined. As a
result, [renewables are poised to overtake coal as the leading power
source in 2025.]{.underline} [This progress is truly
global]{.underline}. As a share of electricity, solar and wind is
scaling twice as fast in the Global South as in the Global North.
Countries like Pakistan and Namibia have used Chinese solar exports to
nearly double their total electricity capacity in just two years.

[only about 14% of global CO2 emissions]{.underline}. [A presidential

While the electricity industry is responsible for 25% of US greenhouse
gas emissions, it is also regarded as the easiest sector to decarbonise
and foundational to subsequent decarbonisation via vehicle, home and
industrial electrification (Lawson,
[2018](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0010)).
[The growth of renewable energy in the **U**nited **S**tates during the
last two decades has been **remarkable**. Renewables are no longer a
fringe part of the energy system. Renewable energy firms **employ
millions of workers** in both installation and manufacturing, and the
industry **generates billions of dollars** in fees and tax credits for
some of the world\'s largest financial institutions]{.underline} (Job
Creation & Economic Growth,
[n.d.](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0007);
Knuth,
[2021](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0009)).
On some particularly windy or sunny days, [**renewables provide the
majority of electricity** that courses through the electricity grid
in]{.underline} places like [Texas, Iowa and California.]{.underline} It
is important to note that energy transitions are not just technical
processes. They are also social and economic processes embedded within
our highly unequal society. Energy systems are highly uneven, featuring
multiple territorialisations of energy politics and governance. They are
systems in which remnants of the old come into conflict with the new,
meaning that transitions are less about the replacement of one energy
source with another, than the lumpy and contentious recombination and
reconfiguration of energy sources, forms of governance, and corporate
accumulation strategies (Bridge & Gailing,
[2020](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0003);
Harrison,
[2022](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0006);
Welton,
[2021](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0024)).
In the United States, huge sunk costs in various forms of energy
extraction and electricity generation have made the electricity industry
very slow to change. Moreover, the federal government has traditionally
taken the backseat in energy governance, with the lion\'s share of
electricity policy made at the state level (Boyd & Carlson,
[2016](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0002)).
This means electricity governance varies substantially from state to
state, with some states leaving electricity operations to vertically
integrated monopolies while others are part of 'competitive' regional
wholesale markets that procure power from independent generators. The
last two decades have seen three trends shape the US electricity
industry. First, the use of cheap fracked gas for electricity generation
has increased dramatically to the point that it accounts for
approximately 40% of electricity generation. Second, [natural gas and
renewables have gradually pushed coal out of the generation mix, down to
around 16% in 2023.]{.underline} Third, and finally, electricity demand
has remained largely stagnant, meaning that the size of the electricity
generation pie has largely remained the same even as the ingredients
have been reconfigured (US Energy Information Administration,
[2023](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0022);
Seiple,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0020)).
The rise of renewable energy has been shaped less by the quality of the
resource and more by federal and especially state-level policy, namely
renewable portfolio standards and/or tax incentives (e.g., for many
years cloudy Massachusetts had more installed solar capacity than sunny
Florida or Arizona). But this has begun to change in recent years as
[the falling cost of installing wind and solar has made renewables
attractive to large power buyers, especially when buyers are further
incentivised by generous tax credits and corporate pledges to move to
100% clean and/or renewable energy]{.underline} (Christophers,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0004);
Knuth,
[2021](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0009)).
[This configuration of renewable energy developers, state-level
renewable requirements, and corporate renewable energy
buyers]{.underline} (i.e., Meta, Google, Amazon) [began to coalesce
during Trump\'s first term but was enhanced by the passage of the
IRA]{.underline} by the US Congress in 2022. To attract support from the
politically powerful electric utility industry, the Act is packed with
incentives but very few penalties on carbon emitters---all carrots and
no sticks. [The prime incentives in the IRA are tax
credits]{.underline}. [The Act increased the magnitude of already
available federal tax credits and extended the length of the programme
**through 2032, providing certainty** for renewable
developers]{.underline} (Martin,
[2022](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0012)).
Recent analysis indicates that [**IRA has ramped up renewable energy
generation**, with corresponding greenhouse gas reductions,]{.underline}
though not to levels required to meet US obligations in the Paris
Agreement (Rhodium Group & MIT CEEPR,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0019)).
Beyond tax credits for renewable energy generation, [the IRA also
includes tax incentives for moving 'clean' manufacturing (i.e., solar
panels, batteries, and electric vehicles) to the United States. Since
the passage of the IRA, **hundreds of new manufacturing facilities**
have been announced in the United States., a **majority in** reliably
**Republican states**]{.underline} (Bermel et al.,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0001)).
Indeed, so much manufacturing has moved, or is planning to move, to the
United States that---in combination with the rapid growth of data
centres supporting energy-intensive artificial intelligence -- [electric
utilities are now facing the prospect of growing electricity demand for
the first time in decades]{.underline} (Seiple,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0020)).
Given this scenario, many utilities are eyeing major new investments in
generation, and for some, new natural gas generators, a controversial
but long-lasting solution to their pending generation crunch. This
dynamic makes the coming years even more important to the
decarbonisation of the sector. To begin, there are some Biden-era
policies that Trump can undo by executive order, but [most changes will
rely on Congress]{.underline}, where Republicans hold a slim majority in
both houses. [This]{.underline} likely [makes **broad sweeping change
difficult.**]{.underline} Second, cabinet appointments in the
Departments of Energy and Interior are important for the trajectory of
the energy industry, but because of the heavy reliance of the IRA on tax
credits, the Department of the Treasury---which has issued nearly 100
pieces of guidance on energy tax credit qualifications---may be of
greater importance (Plautz,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0018)).
Third, and relatedly, [Trump treats the stock markets as an important
barometer of a proposed policy\'s popularity]{.underline} (Swan &
Haberman,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0021)),
[meaning that **the financial industry may provide additional guardrails
that will restrain the new administration\'s energy
policy.**]{.underline} With these elements in mind, early reporting from
and conversations with the electricity *and* financial industry press,
consultants and advisory firms point to some likely outcomes. In terms
of fossil fuels, there is no reason to believe that the production of
natural gas in the United States will slow. If anything, there might be
a coming glut over-production. The outlook for coal is less rosy.
Trump\'s first presidential campaign in 2016 featured him wearing a hard
hat and promising to resuscitate the coal industry. Trump did not save
coal the first time because there is not much that can be done to save
the coal industry. The only hope for the coal industry is that
electricity demand growth and regulatory roll-back might delay the
retirement dates scheduled for many of the coal plants across the United
States (Frazin,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0005)).
The question, then, is whether electric utilities will meet new
electricity demand by building new natural gas generation or whether
they will turn towards renewables, storage and/or nuclear. And much of
that decision-making rests on the fate of the IRA. During a
post-election roundtable discussion featuring a group of Republican
Party energy insiders, one commentator framed the IRA issue as having
two sides. On one side are conservative and climate-change denying
Republican lawmakers that staunchly oppose it, viewing it as part of
Biden\'s 'woke' green agenda. More than this, they see a full repeal of
the IRA as an important revenue source to fund their ultimate objective
of extending Trump\'s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end
of 2025 (Martin,
[2024a](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0013)).[1](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-note-0002_24)
Lawmakers on the other side of the issue are Democrats and a small but
influential group of Republicans who---like the signees of the NAM
letter---point to the renewable energy and clean manufacturing projects
spurred by the IRA, many of which are located in Republican states.
Given the slim Republican control over Congress, [the most likely
outcome is that the IRA will be picked apart by a scalpel, not beaten
with a sledgehammer]{.underline} (Martin,
[2024a](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0013)).
Most commentators agree that the most politically vulnerable parts are
subsidies for electric vehicles, followed by programmes that provide tax
credits for residential energy efficiency and electrification upgrades
like heat pumps (Martucci,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0015);
Pearl et al.,
[n.d.](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0017)).
Also highly vulnerable are offshore wind projects---the subject of many
Trump polemics on the campaign trail---although [the administration has
little ability to stop projects that are farther along the development
path.]{.underline} However, many of these projects are already in
jeopardy due to rising costs (Kinniburgh,
[2024](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0008)).
The situation for onshore [wind and solar]{.underline} is better. Recall
that this industry is supported by a variety of policy and financial
forces---state-level renewable portfolio standards, demand from
corporate buyers, and financial institutions eager to acquire tax
credits. It also [benefits from political and economic momentum and
support in both Democratic]{.underline} (e.g., California and New York)
[and Republican]{.underline} (e.g., Texas and Florida)
[strongholds]{.underline}. Importantly, [utilities in the United States
largely support the IRA and are **loath to pivot their strategies**
every four years based on political outcomes]{.underline} (Lipton,
[2022](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0011);
Martin,
[2024b](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.70009#geoj70009-bib-0014)).
[Early indications are that **utilities will stand by their development
pipelines**, most of which are packed full of solar, wind and storage.
Even if Republicans **claw back some of the money** from the IRA by
shortening the time frame for tax credits, **this would have little
impact on projects already under development, sustaining the industry
through at least the next four to five years.** Indeed, many developers
are currently ensuring their projects are far enough along to be
grandfathered in should any changes to the IRA occur]{.underline}
(Martin,

### Link -- Delays the Transition

#### Solar geoengineering is a moral hazard -- it crushes the transition to a low-carbon economy

gases]{.underline}. [Fossil fuel companies]{.underline}, in particular,
[are keen]{.underline} at this point [to pursue any solutions that could
prolong the use of their products.]{.underline} The discussion around
[SRM]{.underline} [could be a dangerous distraction from
the]{.underline} urgently [needed emission reductions in this critical
decade]{.underline} [and the much-needed focus on unlocking the finance
and resources needed to roll out renewable energy and its supporting
technologies at scale.]{.underline} The report appears to recommend
diverting attention, scientific focus, and research budget away from
climate science and mitigation research towards SRM, while being light
in other areas including loss and damage, for instance.

#### Geoengineering creates a moral hazard -- it will gut any public or political pressure to pursue decarbonization

Albert **Lin**, **2013**, Ecology Law Quarterly, 40(673), "Does
geoengineering present a moral hazard?",
https://law.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk10866/files/media/documents/ELQ.MoralHazard.pdf,
mm

How is geoengineering likely to be framed amidst substantial climate
skepticism? Relatedly, and more pertinent to assessing the moral hazard
posed by geoengineering, how is geoengineering likely to be perceived?
Like mitigation efforts, geoengineering operations cannot be justified
without an acknowledgment that climate change is occurring. Accordingly,
one might initially expect opponents of mitigation to be hostile to
geoengineering as well. [[Geoengineering offers a]{.mark} very
[different]{.mark} economic [calculation]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
for the companies that would bear much of the cost of climate
mitigation. Utilities, oil companies, and other [[carbon-intensive
industries would benefit]{.mark} from persuading the public that
geoengineering offers a relatively inexpensive and painless option for
addressing climate change]{.underline}. A climate policy dominated by
geoengineering would facilitate continuation of business as usual,
enabling the avoidance---or at least deferral---of fundamental and
potentially costly changes to current industry practices. Some companies
might even develop a direct financial stake in designing and
implementing geoengineering schemes For purposes of analyzing public
perceptions of geoengineering, the public may fall into two camps
according to their underlying views on climate change: believers and
skeptics. Persons in both groups are subject to heuristics and biases
that foster overconfidence in geoengineering's efficacy and
underweighting of geoengineering's risks.208 [[Cultural cognition theory
suggests]{.underline},]{.mark} moreover, [that climate change
[skeptics]{.mark} [are]{.mark} especially [likely to experience moral
hazard]{.mark} with respect to geoengineering]{.underline}. This
prediction may appear counterintuitive at first, as there is presumably
no need for climate change policy measures---geoengineering or
otherwise---if climate change is not a problem to begin with. But as
cultural cognition theory predicts, the policy options offered in
response to a risk can substantially alter public perceptions of that
risk.209 Specifically, [for climate]{.underline} change
[skeptics]{.underline} who have resisted climate mitigation,
[geoengineering offers a policy option more consonant with culturally
conservative values]{.underline}. Supporting evidence exists in studies
examining the influence of cultural values on perceptions of another
controversial technology, nuclear power. Persons with individualistic
and hierarchical orientations ("hierarchical individualists") tend to be
the strongest supporters of nuclear power, whereas persons with more
communitarian and egalitarian orientations tend to be its strongest
opponents.210 Not surprisingly, the former group also tends to be
relatively skeptical of global warming. When nuclear power is framed as
a possible solution to global warming, however, hierarchical
individualists have been found to be more open to evidence of global
warming.211 For these persons, geoengineering could have an appeal
similar to that of nuclear energy.212 By illustrating how technology
might solve problems faced by humanity, geoengineering could serve as an
affirmation of human initiative, capitalism, and scientific progress.213
[The possibility that one might simultaneously deny climate change and
advocate geoengineering is not merely theoretical. The Cato Institute
has derided]{.underline} [concern]{.underline} [over]{.underline} global
[warming]{.underline} as a "scare" [while framing opposition to
geoengineering as opposition to]{.underline} economic
[growth]{.underline}.214 [Views expressed by]{.underline} scholars
associated with [the American Enterprise Institute]{.underline} (AEI), a
conservative think-tank, [provide a further illustration]{.underline}.
The AEI has financed attacks on climate change science and sponsored
programs critical of international efforts to combat climate change and
other environmental problems.215 At the same time, AEI scholars also
have expressed strong support for geoengineering research and
deployment. Testifying before the House Committee on Science and
Technology, Lee Lane, co-director of AEI's geoengineering project,
characterized stratospheric aerosols and other similarly speculative SRM
techniques as "very likely to be a feasible and effective means of
cooling the planet."216 Advocating that SRM be viewed no differently
than any other policy tool for responding to climate change, Lane
blithely suggested that SRM "may have more upside potential than does
any other climate policy option."217 Samuel Thernstrom, the other
co-director of AEI's geoengineering project, more recently cautioned
that "\[g\]eoengineering should be seen as a complement to mitigation
and adaptation, not an alternative," and deemed it "implausible that any
national leader would argue that geoengineering offers a safe
alternative to emissions reductions---or that the American people would
go along with the idea."218 Nonetheless, Thernstrom touted
geoengineering for its "unique ability to overcome the inertia in the
climate system and provide a degree of rapid cooling, if necessary," and
advocated immediate research on geoengineering.219 The knowledge thereby
gained, he contended, "would be relatively cheap and potentially
priceless, while continued ignorance of this field would be reckless . .
. ."220 Perhaps unsurprisingly, the proponents of these views make
little mention of geoengineering's drawbacks. They also gloss over the
tremendous difficulties of developing effective geoengineering
techniques and determining whether they would actually work.
[[Deployment of any serious geoengineering project is]{.mark} estimated
to be [decades away]{.mark}, even if research efforts were accelerated
immediately and even if such efforts ultimately proved
successful.]{.underline}221 Simply put, [[geoengineering offers no magic
bullet]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Efforts to frame [geoengineering]{.mark}
as a necessary]{.underline} choice under desperate circumstances
nevertheless [[may exacerbate the moral hazard
effect]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Proponents]{.underline} [of
geoengineering]{.underline} research have [described
[geoengineering]{.mark} as "the]{.underline} [only]{.underline} human
[response that can fend off rapid]{.underline} and high-consequence
[climate impacts]{.underline}."222 [Such [statements]{.mark} [shift
attention away from mitigation]{.mark} by "play\[ing\] on the fears of
the public and advocat\[ing\] technological quick-fixes rather than
reasonable debate about instituting difficult changes]{.underline} to
our resource-based and extractive mode of existence."223 The ease with
which geoengineering supporters sometimes make their arguments
underscores the potentially widespread psychological and political
appeal of geoengineering. [Because it is susceptible to framing as a
magic bullet against climate change, geoengineering may prove
attractive]{.underline} not only to persons whose cultural values align
with geoengineering, but also [to the broader American
public.]{.underline} [[Studies find that Americans strongly support GHG
emission reductions, yet tend to oppose]{.underline}]{.mark} specific
[[policies that would discourage fossil fuel
consumption]{.underline}.]{.mark}224 Interpreting this apparent
contradiction, the author of one such study suggests that American
public opinion on climate change is "in a 'wishful thinking' stage of
opinion formation, in which they hope the problem can be solved by
someone else (government, industry, etc.), without changes in their own
priorities, decision making or behavior."225
[[Geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}, in hinting at a cheap and easy
resolution---or at least postponement---of our climate reckoning,
[[plays directly into this wishful thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
if [[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} recognize the problems associated
with geoengineering, they [[face little incentive to dispel]{.mark} any
[illusions]{.mark} the public may hold]{.underline}. Rather than make
difficult choices that impose costs on the electorate, [it will be
easier for elected officials to point to a technological fix that may
one day arrive, obviating the need for sacrifice or a departure from
business as usual]{.underline}.226 By suggesting additional potential
options for responding to climate change, [[geoengineering reduces the
political pressure for near-term mitigation and provides opponents of
mitigation with a new rationale for further
delay]{.underline}]{.mark}.227 In the end, people might want so much to
believe that geoengineering will work that they may allow politicians
and interested parties to convince them that it will work, regardless of
evidence to the contrary.

### Petrostates ! - AT Petrostates Aren't Aggressive

#### Robust empirical research supports the connection between petrostates and conflict

University), Security Studies, 30(4), "Oil and War: An Exchange,"

Hye Ryeon [Jang]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Benjamin
[Smith]{.underline} [argue]{.underline} in their article "Pax Petrolica?
Rethinking the Oil--Interstate War Linkage" [that]{.underline}, when
reexamined, [the historical data are "more supportive of
petro-peace]{.underline} than of petro-aggression." Their argument is a
direct critique of my research on that topic, which includes my book
Petro-Aggression: When Oil Causes War. They have a number of concerns,
but their central claim is that "the Iran--Iraq War is singularly
responsible for what was believed to have been a radical
petro-aggression effect globally." In various statistical models, they
add a dummy variable for the eighteen country-year observations
associated with the Iran--Iraq War (1980--88) and argue that this
reveals a key variable from my research to be statistically
insignificant. The key variable is petro-revolutionary, a dichotomous
indicator for a state that is both a "petrostate" (defined as a state
with net oil exports of at least 10% of gross domestic product (GDP))
and has a revolutionary government. The tendency of petro-revolutionary
states to instigate interstate conflicts at a high rate is the
phenomenon I label "petro-aggression." Jang and Smith engage with my
research on the topic in a serious way. [I do not find their critique
compelling]{.underline}, but I am grateful for the chance to reevaluate
the evidence from new perspectives. [Their critique might actually add
to the confidenc]{.underline}e we can have in the idea of
[petro-aggression]{.underline} rather than reduce it. There are six
reasons why: first, we probably should not see the Iran--Iraq War as an
outlier; second, even if we do, there are different ways of dealing with
outliers that statisticians typically prefer to the method Jang and
Smith use, and those methods generate different results; third, even if
we accept their method, their results do not justify affirming the null
hypothesis; fourth, their other concerns about measures, when tested,
actually provide empirical support for petro-aggression; fifth, the
qualitative historical evidence adds further support; and sixth, when
judging robustness, we should consider the full range of empirical tests
rather than a highly selective focus. [First, it is not at all clear
that the Iran--Iraq War is an outlier]{.underline}. Standard econometric
texts repeatedly warn analysts away from treating observations too
swiftly as outliers. It is safe to do so only rarely: for example, if
survey data indicated the age of a respondent as 150 years, we could
view that as an outlier, probably an error, because there are zero known
cases of humans living that long. The Iran--Iraq War was not that kind
of event at all. We know it existed; it is not an error. It was a major
war with enormous casualties on both sides, precisely the kind of event
that people studying the causes of war hope to understand and prevent.
Jang and Smith provide relatively little justification for treating it
as an outlier. [They are correct that the war produced a lot of
militarized interstate disputes]{.underline} (MIDs), [but big wars do
that]{.underline}. After all, the Iran--Iraq War was the longest
conventional interstate war of the twentieth century, and it took place
at the heart of the global oil system, so it involved many players. Iran
instigated 62 MIDs in the 1980--88 period and Iraq instigated 35,
meaning a rate of 6.9 and 3.9 MIDs per year, respectively. That is a
lot, but still a lower rate than Germany's 53 MIDs between 1939 and
1944, a rate of 8.2 per year. The Iran--Iraq War stands out because few
big wars occurred in the period the dataset covers (1945--2001), but
**[historically such wars do happen]{.underline}**. We should not treat
big wars as outliers simply because they produce a lot of MIDs. The term
"outlier" might actually be confusing. Although the Iran--Iraq War might
be an outlier in the quantitative sense that it generated a lot of MIDs,
that does not mean the war is an outlier in terms of how
petro-revoltutionary states tend to behave. [Petro-revolutionary states
like Libya]{.underline} under Muammar Gaddafi [or]{.underline}
[Sudan]{.underline} under Omar al-Bashir tend to [have leaders with
risk-tolerant, aggressive preferences]{.underline}, as demonstrated by
their behavior prior to taking office, which shape their foreign policy
while in office. Both Saddam Hussein and Ruhollah Khomeini seem to fit
that description during the Iran--Iraq War. [Petrostates tend to have
disproportionate military spending during oil booms,]{.underline} which
expands military options such as warfare. Again, military spending in
1970s Iran and Iraq fits this pattern. And petro-revolutionaries often
have oil money to buy off domestic political opponents, who might
otherwise be able to mount opposition to their aggressive policies.
Again, behaviors by Hussein and Khomeini fit that pattern. Thus, [the
Iran--Iraq War does not look an outlier]{.underline} from a theoretical
view. Second, even if we do accept the Iran--Iraq War as a potential
outlier, the question becomes what to do about it. Jang and Smith pursue
one option, but others exist that are at least as valid and arguably
better. For instance, statisticians often prefer a process known as
"winsorization," by which extreme values are limited or capped at
reasonable values near the top end of the distribution. If we winsorize
the Correlates of War's MIDs data, 3 MIDs per state-year is a reasonable
cap because it is the 95th percentile value among state-years with
instigated MIDs. Outside the Iran--Iraq War, there were forty-eight
state-years that had at least 3 MIDs, involving states such as China,
Argentina, or Turkey. So, we can cap any state-year observation at a
value of 3, and rerun the regression. Or, even more pointedly, we could
cap at 3 the observations for Iran and Iraq between 1980 and 1988,
inclusive, but not cap any of the other observations. The results, using
both approaches, are shown in Table 1. In both cases, the coefficient
for petro-revolutionary is positive and above the standard 95%
confidence threshold. In short, we should not treat the Iran--Iraq War
as an outlier, but [even if we do th**e evidence for petro-aggression
remains reasonably strong**.]{.underline} Third, even if we accept the
Iran--Iraq War as an outlier and adopt Jang and Smith's approach to
dealing with it, the coefficient for the key variable
petro-revolutionary is positive and not far from statistical
significance at standard thresholds. In Jang and Smith's statistical
specification with the Iran--Iraq War dummy variable, the coefficient
for petro-revolutionary has a p-value of p = 0.12 (based on their Model
3). Though it is conventional to reject the null hypothesis only if the
p-value is less than 0.05, indicating a 95% confidence level, we should
not affirm the opposite when p = 0.12, indicating only an 88% confidence
level. This known as affirming the null hypothesis, and it is not
warranted just because p is larger than 0.05. Notably, the size of the
coefficient for petro-revolutionary remains large (0.345) in their Model
3, larger than the coefficient for revolutionary government, which is
statistically significant and commonly understood by scholars as
correlated with interstate conflict. That 0.345 coefficient indicates a
31% increase of the expected number of MIDs instigated by such states.
Of course, the standard error for petro-revolutionary is high because
those governments are rare. That creates statistical noise surrounding
the signal. [It is striking that even when we statistically isolate a
major war between two petro-revolutionary states, we still have more
reason to believe]{.underline} (with roughly 88% confidence) [that
petro-revolutionary states are correlated with interstate
conflict]{.underline} than we have reason to believe the null
hypothesis. Petro-aggression also helps us understand the Iran--Iraq War
itself (as a case of two petro-revolutionary states fighting each
other), rather than treating it in a theoretically ad hoc manner. Even
if we treat the war as sui generis, the theory of petro-aggression can
account for the Iran--Iraq War and many other events. The fourth reason
to have confidence in petro-aggression comes from the alternative
measures Jang and Smith use to test its robustness. They spend several
pages in their article criticizing the way I operationalized some of the
variables, describing those measures as "errors." For instance, they
argue that my method of identifying "petrostates" dichotomously (based
on net oil exports) is an error and argue for the preferability of
measuring petrostates based on oil income per capita. They correctly
note that their preferred measure has become common in the literature on
whether oil inhibits democracy, but that does not mean there is only one
true way of identifying petrostates, especially if considering oil's
effect on other dependent variables besides democracy (interstate
conflict, in this case). Jang and Smith's approach suggests that, at
least sometimes, Denmark is more of a petrostate than Nigeria is,
because Denmark has more oil income per capita than Nigeria does. That
is strongly counterintuitive for most people because oil appears to
affect political incentives more in Nigeria than Denmark, relative to
the counterfactual of no oil. By contrast, my measure treats Nigeria as
a petrostate and Denmark as a non-petrostate. Setting aside the
rationale for each measure, it turns out that even when Jang and Smith
use their preferred definition and measure of petrostate, the evidence
again supports petro-aggression. In their Model 9, they expand the scope
of the analysis to include more years than in my analysis, use
alternative specifications of the control variables, and find that the
coefficient for petro-revolutionary is positive and statistically
significant at 95% confidence. In their Model 11, they do the same plus
use their preferred measure of petrostate (based on Michael Ross and
Paasha Mahdavi's oil income per capita data), and again find that the
coefficient for petro-revolutionary is positive and above the 95%
confidence threshold. Only when they add in the control variable for the
Iran--Iraq War does the statistical significance fall below 95% (Models
10 and 12). Thus, [the]{.underline} whole weight of their [critique
stands or falls only based on how we treat the Iran--Iraq War, and
petro-aggression is otherwise quite robust to alternative measures and
data]{.underline}. The fifth reason to have confidence in
petro-aggression comes from the qualitative evidence that I offered in
my 2013 book. Jang and Smith write, "Econometric research could benefit
from reengagement with close-range regional expertise," but they chose
not to engage with the five chapter-length case studies I conducted of
Iraq, Iran, Libya, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia. The first four of those
cases offer within-country variation with respect to revolutionary
governments; the fifth, Saudi Arabia, serves as a prominent example of
nonrevolutionary petrostates. The book's qualitative analysis
complements the quantitative analysis and offers distinct advantages in
terms of process tracing, congruence testing, and contextual analysis.
[The country-case histories in Petro-Aggression illustrate the causal
mechanisms]{.underline}. For instance, [the cases show that oil revenues
offer petrostate leaders considerable political autonomy from their
population, shielding them from the political backlash if they engage in
military adventurism in foreign policy.]{.underline} Remarkably, no
petro-revolutionary leader who lost a war has been forced out of office
due to domestic political backlash, even though leaders of
non-petrostates who lose wars are frequently punished this way.
Anticipation of those outcomes should induce leaders in non-petrostates
to be cautious about instigating military conflicts, but leaders in
petrostates need not be so cautious. In addition, [there is strong
qualitative evidence that revolutionary leaders tend to be risk
tolerant, which plausibly makes them more likely to engage in interstate
conflict]{.underline}. The sixth and final reason to have confidence in
petro-aggression stems from considering the full range of efforts to
test petro-aggression's empirical robustness. Jang and Smith conclude
that the evidence for petro-aggression is "not robust" and "quite weak,"
phrases which normally suggest the finding is fragile to multiple
alternative specifications. Yet, in my 2010 article and 2013 book on
petro-aggression, I described some of the many robustness checks I
conducted. For instance, I used data from the International Crisis
Behavior dataset as a measure of conflict instead of MIDs. I also used
other measures of the dependent variable, such as the "Side A" indicator
for the conflict initiator. I used four different variants of the
definition of petrostate (for example, continuous measures of oil income
per capita or as fraction of GDP), each of which were substituted for
the dichotomous measure of petrostate, and the regressions retested. I
used logit and rare events logit regressions. The dataset on
revolutionary governments has a secondary variable called ambiguous that
indicate borderline cases or cases where information was missing; that
variable was used for robustness testing. I used dichotomous measures of
democracy instead of continuous ones. I added various potential control
variables, such as: year fixed effects; a lagged dependent variable (to
control for rivalries and ongoing disputes); and the Correlates of War
measure composite indicator of national capability (CINC). The models
were also retested when the sample was restricted to developing
countries only, and when all the independent variables were lagged by
one year, to avoid possible endogeneity. In none of these robustness
tests did any of the results change materially. These tests for
robustness are especially relevant because some of them directly address
the very concerns Jang and Smith raise in their article. They argue that
there are "two key problems with the \[Colgan\] data." The first is:
"The GDP per capita variable drawn from replication ... was lagged in
that study. In the Colgan data, it is not, meaning that every
country-year observation for the indicator is off by one year." Yet, as
I described in the 2010 article, I did lag by one year the GDP per
capita variable (along with the other independent variables). Reasonable
people can differ about whether a one-year lag in the variables is the
right specification, but either way it does not change the result. The
second problem, in Jang and Smith's view, is "the use of outdated
indicators for oil wealth," specifically my dichotomous measure of
petrostate, as opposed to their continuous measure of oil income per
capita. They ignore, however, that I used a continuous measure of oil
income per capita, precisely to address the potential concerns Jang and
Smith describe in their article. Using a continuous oil income measure,
either with the data I used or the Ross and Mahdavi data that Jang and
Smith use in theirs, does not change the basic finding of
petro-aggression. For all these reasons, Jang and Smith's critique seems
unwarranted. [The evidence of petro-aggression has proven
strong.]{.underline} I have set aside Jang and Smith's critique of
Cullen S. Hendrix's work, and I cannot fully engage their claim that oil
has primarily a peace-inducing effect, what they term "Pax Petrolica."
Briefly, I do not think that oil has such a monolithic effect on
interstate politics; instead, oil's net effect on interstate relations
depends significantly on the relevant states' domestic politics. The
main point, however, is that [the basic empirical pattern of
petro-aggression is remarkably robust and stands up well to sustained
critical scrutiny]{.underline}. The interesting question, to my mind, is
not whether the empirical pattern exists, but why. In my original
research, I emphasized the internal properties of petro-revolutionary
states, treating them as monads. In new research, I explore the
possibility that many of these same states became counterhegemonic at
the same time they became revolutionary, and thus they became conflict
prone due to political dynamics at the system and subsystem levels,
rather than at the monadic level. It is quite possible both factors are
at work. Regardless, the evidence as a whole suggests that, for
petrostates with revolutionary governments, the net effect of oil has
been to increase the state's propensity for interstate conflict (not
lower it). In short, **[petro-aggression is a force in world
politics.]{.underline}**

petrostates. These are the most oil and gas-reliant countries (as a % of
GDP) and are predominantly in the Middle East, North and West Africa and
South America. [There is a fundamental shift underway as the global

losses as the pace and inevitability of the energy transition increases.
Compared with industry expectations, [petrostates']{.underline}

COP28 host the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is among [28
petrostates]{.underline} that [risk losing over half their revenues from
fossil fuels by 2040 as the energy transition accelerates]{.underline}
[and climate policies tighten]{.underline}, according to new research
from financial think tank Carbon Tracker. "[Electricity is expanding to
become the basis of our entire energy system]{.underline}, driven by
falling costs of wind, solar and batteries," said Guy Prince, senior oil
and gas analyst at Carbon Tracker and author of the report, in a press
statement. "[This is a profound threat to oil and gas exporting
nations]{.underline}, because falling demand for oil and gas is likely
to lead to a significant fall in future revenues. Governments should
waste no time in reducing their dependence on fossil fuel revenues and
take steps to make their economies more resilient and better equipped
for a low-carbon future." [Demand]{.underline} for oil and gas [is
expected to start declining before the end of the decade]{.underline},
with the subsequent oversupply likely to result in falling prices. This,
the report warns, will leave a large hole in the public finances of the
world's petrostates, even those with the lowest cost of production,
hampering their ability to fund public services and threatening their
stability. The 'Petrostates of Decline' report, released on 1 December,
analyses the potential fossil-fuel revenues of 40 oil and gas dependent
countries between 2023 and 2040 in the scenario of a moderately paced
energy transition that limits global warming to 1.8°C. The nations'
revenues will fall from an expected \$17trn to just \$9trn, the research
found. "In many petrostates, a political settlement has become
established where citizens expect high public sector salaries and low or
zero-income taxes along with a generous welfare state," said Prince.
"Restructuring their economies is likely to require parallel political
reforms to make lawmakers more accountable and give citizens greater
representation." [Governments are adopting increasingly tough climate
policies]{.underline} as natural disasters proliferate and intensify,
and the global carbon budget -- the amount of carbon that can be safely
emitted for the world to stay within a 50% chance of limiting global
warming to 1.5°C -- looks likely to be blown before the decade's end. As
COP28 kicked off in Dubai, nearly 120 countries backed a goal to triple
renewables and double energy efficiency by 2030. Language calling for a
"phasedown/out" of "fossil fuels" and "coal" -- with negotiators still
to decide on the final wording -- was also included in a first draft
text circulated at the COP. Some are pushing for a Fossil Fuel
Non-Proliferation Treaty. [The ever-decreasing cost of renewable
energies]{.underline} and electric vehicles, along with the energy
security concerns spotlighted by the Ukraine War, [is diminishing demand
for oil and gas]{.underline}. According to the IEA's World Energy
Outlook 2023, demand for oil will fall from 100 million barrels a day
(b/d) in 2019 to 92.5 million b/d in 2030 and 54.5 million b/d in 2050
if current national policy pledges are fulfilled. Carbon Tracker warns
that a country like the UAE relies on oil and gas for 40% of government
income, but faces a 60% drop in production revenue. Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest oil exporter, is in a similar situation. In Africa,
Nigeria, Angola, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon all rely on
oil and gas for over 60% of their total budgets; and all but Gabon face
a 70% reduction in expected oil and gas revenues. Venezuela is the
country most at risk, with its public finances entirely dependent on oil
and gas revenues, which could be over 80% lower than forecast.
Petrostate governments earn fossil fuel revenues either through
state-owned national oil companies (NOCs) or through taxing oil and gas
production. But [when demand falls, declining prices reduce these
revenues and can render some projects uneconomic.]{.underline} The
highest cost producers will suffer the most, and a moderate transition
is likely to make redundant over 50% of new projects belonging to NOCs
Rosneft (Russia), Ecopetrol (Colombia; this became the tenth government
to join the call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty on 2
December) and Pemex (Mexico). However, **[price slumps will impact all
petrostates]{.underline}**. Countries in the Middle East and North
Africa will see 45% less oil and gas revenues under a moderate
transition than a slow one, with nations in Latin America, the Caribbean
and Africa suffering even more.

### Ocean Acidification ! -- Geoengineering Can't Solve

#### Solar geoengineering can't solve ocean acidification

Introducing particles like sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere could
create a plethora of new and unpredictable problems. Possible negative
impacts may include changing regional weather patterns---creating or
shifting areas of drought or regions that receive extreme
precipitation---or altering tropospheric chemistry and ocean circulation
patterns. Partially blocking the sun's rays could interfere with normal
plant processes and reduce agricultural yields. Adding sulfate aerosols
to the stratosphere would degrade the ozone layer (thereby increasing
global cancer rates) and increase acid rain. [The]{.underline} potential
[effects]{.underline} [of solar radiation management are]{.underline} so
[large and wide-ranging]{.underline} as to implicate almost every aspect
of life on the planet. [Even in best-case scenarios, it would be only a
partial stopgap]{.underline}. [Solar geoengineering]{.underline}, for
example, [does nothing to ameliorate ocean acidification, which occurs
when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} acidification [threatens ocean life]{.underline} like
oysters, clams, sea urchins, corals, and the calcareous phytoplankton
[that]{.underline} help [make up the foundation of the marine food web
on which much of humanity depends]{.underline}.

#### Solar geoengineering won't decrease emissions -- can't solve ocean acidification 

Michael **Proambo et al., 2024,** National Security Perspective (Johns
Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory), "Balancing Act: Assessing Risks and
Governance of Climate Intervention,"

mm

SRM, also known as sunlight reflection methods or albedo modification,
encompasses techniques that cool the earth by increasing the
reflectivity of solar radiation incident on the planet. Increasing the
reflectivity lowers the amount of solar radiation that is converted to
infrared radiation through absorption and emission. Therefore, less
infrared radiation gets trapped by greenhouse gases, resulting in an
overall cooling effect. Figure 1 depicts this concept and the various
methods within it. [Since SRM methods do not decrease atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations, they would not reduce or reverse some physical
consequences of climate change, such as ocean
acidification]{.underline}. Moreover, [if carbon dioxide concentrations
are not simultaneously reduced]{.underline} in other ways, such as CDR
methods, and especially if carbon dioxide concentrations continue to
grow because of emissions, [interruption or termination of SRM methods
could cause significant environmental and societal damage. If SRM were
to be suddenly terminated, the world would warm, perhaps rapidly, based
on the accumulated atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations]{.underline}.14 This phenomenon is often referred to as
termination risk, termination shock, or millennial dependence.
Consequently, if SRM were started for climate intervention, it would
need to be perpetually maintained; if the intervention were stopped,
climate change could become much worse.

#### Geoengineering can't solve ocean acidification -- only GHG reductions can

Phil **McKenna**, 9/5/**15**, Inside Climate News, "Geoengineering will
not save ocean life from acidification, research says,"

[Waiting to tackle ocean acidification]{.underline} caused by climate
change [through]{.underline} yet-to-be developed
[geoengineering]{.underline} schemes [will be too little too late to
prevent mass extinction of ocean life]{.underline}, a new study
concludes. [Cutting carbon emissions is the only way for oceans to
recover]{.underline} from the devastating effects of climate change,
according to the new research published in Nature Climate Change. While
using deliberate, large-scale manipulation of earth processes to combat
global warming has its proponents, intervening in the climate through
potentially dangerous geoengineering technologies is unproven. And even
if carbon dioxide could be removed from the atmosphere, ocean
acidification already spurred by CO2 will persist for centuries. This
could cause mass extinctions of marine species, researchers concluded.
["Once the ocean is severely affected by high carbon dioxide, it is
virtually impossible to undo these alterations on a human-generation
timescale]{.underline}," said Sabine Mathesius of the Potsdam Institute
for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. Mathesius and
colleagues used computer modeling to simulate the effects of CO2 removal
on ocean acidification under a high emissions, business-as-usual
scenario. Acidification, or a decrease in the water's pH level, occurs
when CO2 is absorbed by seawater and reacts by producing acid. Increased
ocean acidity harms a wide range of organisms including coral, mussels,
clams, sea urchins, barnacles and microscopic plankton that use calcium
carbonate, a mineral that dissolves with increased ocean acidity, to
build their shells and other structures. Damage to coral reefs is one
well-known example of the effects of increased ocean acidity, but such
acidification affects all organisms that rely on calcium carbonate
including coccolithophores, phytoplankton found in large numbers
throughout the ocean. "They are really at the base of a lot of food
chains," said Steven Davis, an earth systems scientist at the University
of California, Irvine. "[If oceans are acidified those things are going
to suffer and it could destabilize whole webs of the food
chain]{.underline}." The group looked at the effect of removing CO2 from
the atmosphere at two rates. The first rate, 5 gigatons of carbon per
year, equals half of today's annual CO2 emissions. They then modeled a
more aggressive rate of 25 gigatons of carbon per year, or 2.5 times
current annual emissions. Even the higher removal rate, which the
authors describe as "probably infeasible," would be unable to return the
oceans to preindustrial conditions by 2700, which was the end of the
simulation period. [The study also looked at whether a high CO2 emission
rate, followed by intensive carbon removal, would have the same effect
on the oceans as a continuously low rate of carbon emissions achieved
through immediate reductions]{.underline}. [The simulations
showed]{.underline} near-surface ocean waters would respond quickly to a
geoengineered removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, but [the deep ocean
would take several centuries or more to approach the pH levels of a
continuous low-emissions scenario]{.underline}. ["There really is no
replacement for]{.underline} drastically [cutting]{.underline} our
[emissions]{.underline} now," said Davis. "Swallowing a spider to catch
a fly won't work." Davis said he doubted whether removing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere on such a large scale is even achievable. One
controversial technique to pull carbon from the atmosphere is to grow
biomass---crops, plant or tree matter, which suck up CO2 as they
grow---burn it to generate electricity, and then capture and bury all of
its CO2 emissions deep underground. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change has endorsed the carbon-sucking technique given the
urgent need to shrink the earth's carbon footprint, with a caveat that
considerable scientific uncertainty remains about its risks and costs.
To remove large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, it would likely
take industrial methods that use chemicals to capture carbon dioxide
directly from the air. That approach is currently being tested in small
scale pilots by companies like Carbon Engineering and Global Thermostat
but the cost would be prohibitively expensive, Davis said. "We are
talking about vastly larger dollars than anyone has suggested it would
cost to switch over to renewables today," Davis said. "You are getting
towards the GDP of large economies." Graciela Chichilnisky, an economist
at Columbia University and the chief executive of Global Thermostat,
said her company is developing a CO2 removal system that will
significantly reduce costs by harnessing waste heat from coal-fired
power plants to power their operations. Chichilnisky said atmospheric
removal of C02 must be developed along with energy like solar power and
other renewables. She cited a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change that states "a large fraction of anthropogenic climate
change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century
to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of
CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period." "You need to do \[CO2
removal and develop low-emissions energy\] but the one you need to do
right now is the removal of CO2 in massive quantities from the air,"
Chichilnisky said. [Some]{.underline}, however, [fear that even talk of
the potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]{.underline}
at a later date [will make countries more likely to put off emissions
reductions]{.underline}. [The resulting increase in ocean acidification
from such a delay **could cause irreversible catastrophic
changes**]{.underline}, Davis said. A 2008 study published in the Annals
of the New York Academy of Sciences notes that "past mass extinction
events have been linked to ocean acidification, and the current rate of
change in seawater chemistry is unprecedented." Davis says if emissions
continue at current levels the effect it will have on oceans could
spread beyond the marine environment. "The oceans are this real buffer
to the earth's systems," Davis said. "We are forcing it slowly but
surely and the problem is once we get it moving in a direction it is
really hard to reverse that."

#### Solar geoengineering will intensify ocean acidification -- cooling the ocean surface without reducing C02 intensifies the acidification of the deep oceans -- that collapses marine ecosystems

Kimberly **Samuels-Crow**, 11/26/**24**, SRM 260, "SRM Cannot Address
Ocean Acidification,"
https://srm360.org/article/srm-cannot-address-ocean-acidification/, mm

CO2 emissions, the main driver of human-caused climate change, have also
acidified the ocean since the start of the industrial revolution. Ocean
acidification is the result of chemical reactions between CO2 in the air
and water that make key shell-building compounds less available for
marine organisms, weakening their skeletons and shells. This would
threaten the foundation of marine food webs, impacting commercial and
indigenous fisheries,1 the livelihoods of 300 million people, and a
major source of protein for more than half of the world's population.2
Today, the ocean has an average pH3 of around 8.05. While seawater has a
pH above 7 and is therefore alkaline, it is more acidic than it has been
in the past 2 million years and is at least 25% more acidic now than
before the industrial revolution. [Sunlight reflection
methods]{.underline} (SRM) like stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)
[cannot directly address the ocean acidification problem]{.underline}.
Instead [SRM could enhance the ability of some ecosystems on land to
retain carbon, decreasing CO2 in the atmosphere]{.underline}.4 [However,
CO2 dissolves more readily in colder water. This enhanced CO2 solubility
could cancel out any benefit of SRM on the carbon cycle and **may lead
to increased acidity** at greater ocean depths]{.underline}.5 The ocean
absorbs CO2 at its surface, taking in about 25% of human-caused CO2
emissions per year.6 The ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 makes it the
second largest carbon reservoir after the solid earth, partially
mitigating the warming effects of fossil fuel combustion.7 However, the
accumulation of CO2 in the ocean since the start of the industrial
revolution has affected ocean water chemistry and marine life. When
atmospheric CO2 dissolves in water, it reacts to form carbonic acid
(H2CO3) -- the substance that gives sparkling water its sharp or acidic
taste. As CO2 emissions increase, carbonic acid in the ocean also
increases, making the ocean more acidic.8 Once CO2 reacts with water,
forming carbonic acid, a series of chemical reactions takes place. These
chemical reactions ultimately decrease the relative abundance of
carbonate ions (CO32−), which shell-forming organisms use to build their
shells.9 Models predict ocean acidity will continue to increase. By the
end of the 21st century, models predict pH will decrease by around 0.01
if emissions are significantly cut (scenario SSP1-1.9) or around 0.39 in
an extreme high-emissions scenario (scenario SSP5-8.5).10 [Increasingly
acidic water could lead to extensive die-offs of]{.underline} coral
reefs and exacerbate harm to other [marine ecosystems]{.underline}.7
Ocean acidification, through its effects on shell-forming organisms,
ultimately impacts the people and industries that rely on the ocean.
Increased ocean acidification makes it more difficult for organisms,
including shellfish and tiny organisms that form the basis of the marine
food web, to build and maintain shells.11 This causes shells to become
thinner or dissolve.9 Impacts on shell-builders affect other animals
that rely on them for food, including humans. Globally, economic losses
in the shellfish industry alone are estimated to be \$6 billion to \$100
billion per year by 2100.1 Loss of shellfish will also have major
impacts on indigenous and rural groups​​.1 Ocean acidification has
additional impacts on the concentrations of harmful pollutants that fish
accumulate, which ultimately pose threats to human health. For example,
fish in acidified waters accumulate more mercury, aluminium, iron, zinc,
copper, and lead in their tissues, posing a poisoning hazard to people
who rely on fish for protein.2 Coral reefs are also at risk from warming
and ocean acidification. Around the world, an estimated 500 million
people rely on coral reefs for food, coastal protection, and income.1
Though it is difficult to assign a cost to these valuable "ecosystem
services", estimates range from \$29.8 billion to \$376 billion per
year.1 The ocean's capacity to store carbon is changing as the climate
changes. Increased acidification, warmer ocean temperatures, and changes
in wind and storm patterns alter the amount of CO2 the ocean can absorb
and store.12,13 [Without interventions, the ocean's ability to store
carbon is likely to weaken as the climate continues to
change]{.underline}.14 [This would lead to more CO2 in the atmosphere
and increased warming]{.underline}. Suggested sunlight reflection
methods (SRM) like stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) are not
expected to have a direct impact on ocean acidification but could have
indirect effects through the global carbon cycle, i.e., the flow of
carbon atoms between Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land.5 SRM could
decrease temperatures, enhancing the ability of non-marine carbon sinks
to retain carbon or remove CO2 from the air. For example, [by cooling
the Arctic, SAI could slow permafrost melting and the associated carbon
loss to the atmosphere]{.underline}.4 Further, SAI, by scattering light,
could enhance the ability of plants to take CO2 from the atmosphere.5
SRM could change the distribution of acidity in the ocean relative to a
climate without SRM deployment. [Without SRM, ocean currents that
transport CO2 to the deep ocean are expected to weaken. With SRM, these
currents are expected to stay strong]{.underline}.15 [Therefore, the net
effect of SRM in a high-CO2 world would likely be little change in
acidity at the ocean surface **but increased acidity at greater
depths**]{.underline}.5 [To tackle rising ocean acidification, CO2
emissions would need to be eliminated]{.underline}, and to reverse it
would require large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal methods
to safely store CO2 away from the atmosphere and ocean.

#### The DA turns case -- the impact ensures a system failure, triggering a termination shock and runaway warming

decision makers,"

This concern stems directly from the possibility that of the prospect of
[successful]{.underline} SRM [geoengineering would make emissions
reductions seem less urgent and take the heat off
politicians]{.underline}. Then, as the editors of Scientific American
recently wrote, [carbon dioxide would continue to build up in the
atmosphere]{.underline}, "breaching the level of 450 parts per million
by volume (ppmv) that many climatologists now recommend as the upper
limit, then passing the 550 ppmv mark that is the goal of many current
policy initiatives, and eventually reaching ... a level not seen on
Earth since the days of the dinosaurs." [The danger then becomes that if
the geoengineering effort should ever falter, "a century's worth of
warming would hit us]{.underline}."35 [It would hit with a speed
unprecedented in the Earth's history, making adaptation nearly
impossible]{.underline} for large numbers of plant and animal species,
and perhaps for human society Unchecked carbon dioxide emissions would
build up in the ocean as well as the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has a
lifetime in the atmosphere of about a hundred years, but large amounts
of CO2 stored in the ocean would outgas for a much longer time, keeping
the atmosphere laden with CO2 . This means that any
[geoengineering]{.underline} initiatives that allow such build-ups to
occur [would need to have]{.underline} internationally sanctioned
[control that is ultra-reliable and proof against mechanical failures,
human error, economic depressions and funding failures, wars, terrorism,
natural disasters and simple apathy across many centuries]{.underline}.
It may be, therefore, that the social and institutional requirements for
some forms of geoengineering are much more daunting than the engineering
requirements.36

#### A nuclear war would disrupt geoengineering -- triggers termination shock and turns the case

the Governance of an Unprecedented Technology,"

Ironically, [one argument against]{.underline} doing [geoengineering is
that we might someday stop doing it]{.underline} (Matthews and Caldeira
2007). [This]{.underline} so-called [termination problem is based on the
fear that we might stop]{.underline} geoengineering
[suddenly]{.underline}, long after we started using it, [causing
temperatures to rise much more rapidly than if we had never
geoengineered in the first place]{.underline} (Goes, Tuana, and Keller
2011). Of course, the incentives to terminate geoengineering abruptly
would be very low for precisely this reason. It seems more likely that
if geoengineering produced unexpected problems long after we started
using it, countries would reduce its use gradually while at the same
time taking other actions, such as increasing investments in adaptation
and efforts to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO2.12 Of course,
[there is]{.underline} also [the possibility that geoengineering would
be terminated abruptly]{.underline} (and unavoidably) [because of an
unrelated catastrophe, such as nuclear war]{.underline} or an asteroid
strike. But because geoengineering could be deployed unilaterally by a
great number of countries, problems in one country or region would not
prevent the redeployment of geoengineering somewhere else. [Only a truly
global catastrophe could cause geoengineering to fail
permanently,]{.underline} and in such a case the global community would
likely have more serious problems to address than the unmanaged
termination of geoengineering.

### Cap K -- Link

#### Solar geoengineering is a tool to manage the environmental crisis of capitalism -- it strengthens the hands of financial capital 

Kevin **Surprise** **and** JP **Sapinski**, **2022**, Conference of
Socialist Economists, 47(4), "Whose climate intervention? Solar
geoengineering, fractions of capital, and hegemonic strategy,"
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03098168221114386, mm

[Capitalism's structural drive for constant expansion and accumulation
are the root cause of the climate crisis]{.underline}, and the climate
crisis -- given its capacity to undermine the conditions of capitalist
production and generate radical, anti-capitalist social movements --
portends a systemic crisis for capital. [The primary
response]{.underline} to this crisis [has been 'green']{.underline} or
climate [capitalism]{.underline}, [but there are fundamental limits to
this]{.underline} competitive, market driven [approach]{.underline} --
not least of which stems from competing fractions of capital within the
power bloc -- necessitating state intervention to enact the compromises
necessary for rapid decarbonization. Yet, given the structural confines
of the capitalist political economy, state intervention in
ecologic-economic crises is also fundamentally limited. [It is
t]{.underline}hus increasingly [likely that the only way for capitalism
to manage climate change on relevant timescales is through the
deployment of]{.underline} SG \[[solar geoengineering]{.underline}\] as
an integral aspect of near-term climate policy. [The primary actors
funding SG as a way to 'buy time' for capitalist climate policy
are]{.underline} philanthropies and [billionaires]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} myriad [connections to corporate power]{.underline},
particularly in the technology and financial sectors. We detail US-based
philanthropic funding of SG focusing on connections to specific
fractions of capital, demonstrating that -- contrary to popular critique
-- [the technology and financial sectors are considerably more invested
in SG technology than the fossil fuel industry]{.underline}. [We trace
this]{.underline} new [alignment to the rise of the 'technodollar
coalition' in the capitalist power bloc vis-a-vis the nascent decline of
fossil capital]{.underline}, the shift in approach to SG (from a distant
emergency measure to a near-term mechanism to 'buy time'), and to shared
ideologies of philanthrocapitalism and ecomodernism. We then demonstrate
the ways in which this approach is being taken seriously by major
corporate-backed think tanks and key segments of the US state.3 That SG
has moved from the right-wing fringes to high-level government
discussions signifies that other attempts to manage climate change from
within the narrow constraints of capitalism continue to fail, and that
the shift in funding sources, aim, and [rhetoric around SG research
renders the technology more palatable to the liberal-capitalist
state]{.underline}. Ideologies pushing inclusion of SG in US climate
policy as a temporary supplement to mitigation that has potential
'humanitarian' benefits fit exceptionally well within the liberal,
technocratic centrism of the Biden Administration and the Democratic
Party. Here [we are poised to see a state-led compromise within the
capitalist class around 'climate intervention' that can appeal to both
fossil and climate capital, rendering SG not a humanitarian tactic but a
tool of class rule]{.underline}.

### China Soft Power DA -- Link

#### China will fill the geoengineering void in the Arctic -- that's key to its soft power

Versen, J., Z. **Mnatsakanyan**, **and** J. **Urpelainen**. **2022**.

Concerns in the Arctic and Beyond." Climatic Change 171, no. 3: 27.
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-022-03345-8.

While the Arctic is already experiencing the impact of anthropogenic
climate change, [it appears that]{.underline}, from a geopolitical
perspective, [there is not much of a global appetite to engage in
geoengineering efforts in the Arctic at this time]{.underline},
especially considering the economic opportunities created by melting
Arctic ice. [This does not mean there will never be
interest]{.underline} in addressing the effects of climate change in the
Arctic. [China]{.underline}, for instance, [may engage in this type of
geoengineering research and seek to conduct experiments in the Arctic in
order to continue establish its presence in the region as well as
**boost its image as a leader** in the global conversation around
climate change and the environment]{.underline}. While doing anything
unilaterally in the Arctic will prove difficult for [China]{.underline}
given issues of sovereignty and exclusive economic zones, it [has shown
it is able to cooperate with a variety of sovereign actors in the region
and could feasibly do so with geoengineering as well]{.underline}.

### Environmental Management K -- Link

#### Geoengineering is a techno-quick fix attempt to manage the unmanageable -- controlling with the atmosphere will divorce us from the natural world -- the technological intervention will eventually fail which turns the Aff

[The idea of dimming the sun carries a number of problems]{.underline}.
First, take the ethical conundrum of unequal benefits. What if world
leaders decided to deploy the sulfur option and, as one climate model
has suggested, an engineered cooling led to a decrease in monsoon rains
over Asia? In such a scenario, geo-engineering could benefit some 5
billion people, while putting another 2 billion people in danger of
drought and famine. The risk of unequal benefits connects to a second
difficult question: Who would control such powerful technology? Few
people would want the US (or Chinese) military to run the weather.
Corporate control would have its own drawbacks. As Robock put it to me:
"Would you trust the ExxonMobil geo-engineering unit?" Leaving
management of a makeshift sky to the lowest bidder seems imprudent, to
say the least. Thernstrom says one of the virtues of geo-engineering is
precisely this centralized control. While unilateral emissions
reductions are pointless, unilateral geo-engineering could work. Any
industrial power could likely do it on its own -- which means you don't
need collective action to cool the planet; you just need countries not
to object. But [even if the major powers agreed to cool the globe,
reaching consensus on how exactly wouldn't be simple]{.underline}. "How
do we even decide what the temperature of the planet will be?" Robock
wonders. "Whose hand will be on the thermostat? What if Russia and
Canada decide they want it warmer and India wants it cooler? How do you
decide those things?" Imagine that the United Nations took control of
the planetary thermostat. That would prevent any country from having a
monopoly over geo-engineering or, worse, having several countries deploy
geo-engineering at cross-purposes. But UN oversight would still involve
geo-politics. It's been close to impossible to get the major polluters
to agree to emissions reductions. Finding cooperation on something as
powerful as geo-engineering would be at least as complicated. That's a
concern of James Lovelock, founder of the Gaia theory. Lovelock's new
book, The Vanishing Face of Gaia, warns that climate change will wreck
civilization. Still, he doesn't think that geo-engineering provides a
way out. "If we can't predict what's happening now, how can we predict
what's happening in 50 years with some kind of artificial mechanism?" he
said to me in a conversation this summer. "It's just moonshine. I think
that [if we ever take on the task of trying to manage the planet
completely -- if we succeed with geo-engineering and we have to run the
planet ourselves]{.underline}, doing what the system now does for free
-- [that we will be on a course for extinction]{.underline}. [Because we
can never manage it. We haven't learned to live with ourselves
yet]{.underline}." As Lovelock points out, [the political and ethical
issues are compounded by an epistemological predicament: No one knows
how the planet would react]{.underline}. [Geo-engineering is unlike any
experiment in history]{.underline} in that the subject is the entire
globe. [On a closed system floating in space, there is no laboratory to
test ideas]{.underline}. "I think geo-engineering is less an ethical
question than a methodological question," Martin Bunzl, a philosopher
who works closely with Robock, said to me. "Could you answer the risk
analysis with enough assurance to deploy at a large scale? The burden of
proof is on the proponents to tell us we know enough about how the
atmosphere works." Take the sulfur aerosol proposal. Would stratospheric
injection of SO2 rip a hole in the ozone layer? Would it decrease the
amount of energy that solar panels capture or, far more troublesome,
affect how plants grow? What if it caused a massive drought in Africa?
These are the known unknowns. More worrisome are the unknown unknowns --
the consequences we can't even imagine. "The difference with large-scale
geo-engineering is that you can't actually proceed in the normal way
that science proceeds: lab to field tests to increased levels of
deployment," Bunzl says. "Because you don't have a model that models the
whole world system well enough. You can only deploy the whole thing. Or
you are trying to make an inference from a small-scale deployment? What
will the consequences be at full strength?" Without a laboratory, any
test to see how the atmosphere would react is already a manipulation of
the atmosphere. "The problem with sulfur insertion is that you can't get
results until you get to a certain strength, and you can't do it without
involving the whole atmosphere," Bunzl says. Or, put another way: The
only way to investigate the results of tinkering with the sky is to
tinker with the sky. The experiment is itself a fait accompli. The
epistemological checkmate means that the very term "geo-engineering" is
flawed. [Fixing the climate isn't like repairing a bridge or building a
skyscraper.]{.underline} The planet is neither an engine nor, in the
metaphor used at the beginning of this essay, a supercomputer. [It's an
enormous living system, intricate beyond the scale of human
understanding]{.underline}, our impressive discoveries notwithstanding.
A machine has certain parts that work in expected ways: Even when
moving, an engine is static. That's why it's reliable. [Earth
is]{.underline} different: It is, by nature, [ceaselessly
dynamic]{.underline}. So [we can't be certain about the outcome of a
given input.]{.underline} [Despite all our fancy computer modeling, we
will never know for sure how the atmosphere will respond to
manipulation]{.underline}. More than an endeavor of science,
geo-engineering would be an act of faith. Beyond the political and
scientific questions lies a much larger moral, even spiritual, problem:
Do humans have the right to undertake such a monumental task? The
geo-engineering debate proves once again that while our technological
society is adept at exploring the how, we are less practiced in pursuing
why and whether. As [geo-engineering]{.underline} proponents
acknowledge, schemes like sulfur aerosol [address only the symptoms, not
the source, of global climate change]{.underline}. [That fact betrays
our society's bias for the techno-fix,]{.underline} the seemingly easy
way out. Seemingly -- because [geo-engineering]{.underline} is the most
complicated strategy we could pursue. It [takes a problem, simplifies
its cause, and then exaggerates its solution]{.underline}. It's like a
Rube Goldberg machine, employing eight or nine steps when one or two
would do. Instead of pursuing the elegant solutions -- trading in our
cars for buses, turning off the coal and turning on the wind -- we are
going to build a contraption to make the clouds shinier. Bill Becker,
head of the Presidential Climate Action Project, summed up this thinking
in an essay earlier this year: "Geo-engineering is rooted in the idea
that although we're too stupid to do the simple things that would slow
climate change, we're smart enough to do the improbable things." Indeed,
geo-engineering involves a surfeit of technological imagination and a
poverty of political imagination, an imbalance that's ingrained in the
notion that if we can do something we should do it. We prefer the overly
complicated solutions because they flatter us, confirming our power and
intelligence. This makes geo-engineering -- the ambivalence of its
promoters notwithstanding -- human hubris compounded. It's like doubling
down on self-regard. [Geo-engineering is a bet that we can save
civilization by divorcing our species from the rest of the
globe.]{.underline} [The payoff is the idea that in "fixing" the planet,
we can absolve ourselves of having ruined Earth. The risk is that if we
turn the atmosphere into]{.underline} what Dale Jamieson, director of
environmental studies at NYU, calls [a "human artifact," we will lose
our connection to much of what is best in life]{.underline}. In taking
possession of the sky, we will become ungrounded. [The psychological
ramifications of geo-engineering shouldn't be
underestimated]{.underline}. It's exactly what Bill McKibben worried
about 20 years ago in his seminal book on global warming, The End of
Nature, when he warned of "the imposition of our artificial world in
place of the broken natural one. ... How can there be a mystique of the
rain now that every drop ... bears the permanent stamp of man? Having
lost its separateness, it loses its special power. Instead of being a
category like God -- something beyond our control -- it is now a
category like the defense budget or the minimum wage, a problem we must
work out. This in itself changes its meaning completely, and changes our
reaction to it." [Tinker with the heavens, and our relationship to the
rest of the world suffers. We will sever our bonds to the other natural
systems]{.underline} -- rivers, forests, oceans -- [on which we
depend]{.underline}. We will have made a decision that we can live
without those things. [Once we take responsibility for managing the
planet's curtains, our position in this place changes]{.underline}. [We
will be in charge in a way we never have been before, knowing that
if]{.underline} for any reason we [were to cease overseeing the
sunlight]{.underline}, [global temperatures would shoot upward again,
spelling disaster.]{.underline} [The new role will force upon us an
existential anxiety]{.underline}. Because as soon as we are in control
of the weather, we will always be fearful of letting our grip slip from
the string that keeps the planet in a semblance of balance. [Such
ownership]{.underline} of Earth would be a new step in human evolution.
It [would turn us into a bubble species, living inside a protective dome
of our own making. If that comes to pass, we will cease to view the
world as a comfort. It will have become,]{.underline} instead, [a
threat.]{.underline}

### Politics -- Link -- Unpopular 

#### Republicans will oppose solar geoengineering

David **Shipton**, 4/28/**24**, E-International Relations, (Shipton is a
commercial lawyer and postgraduate student at King's College London),

mm

The second condition to the US deployment of MCB \[marine cloud
brightening\] is a sufficient level of domestic support for the
intervention. Of course, popular support is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for the making of policy, even in representative
democracies. Nevertheless, empirical studies reveal that public opinion
strongly influences policy, especially where the salience of an issue is
high, and politicians are often responsive to public demands on climate
change. [In the case of MCB, the unprecedented nature of the deployment,
together with its significant financial cost, is likely to heighten the
salience of the public debate]{.underline}. Further, because MCB would
need to be maintained in perpetuity until the atmospheric concentrations
of GHGs can be reduced, its deployment would likely span several decades
and need to survive repeated swings between Republican and Democratic
administrations. Authorising the deployment of MCB would also likely
require a filibuster-proof majority in the US Senate. Taken together,
these factors indicate that sustained MCB deployment by the US would
require a significant coalition of bipartisan support. [In a period of
intense political polarisation, the achievement of a consensus over an
issue as potentially divisive as]{.underline} SG \[[solar
geoengineering\] appears challenging. Positions on climate are amongst
the strongest indicators of political identity]{.underline} in the US
[which]{.underline}, along with guns and abortion, [reflect "two
Americas divided along ideological lines]{.underline}". Indeed, [a
significant proportion of Republicans currently deny the very existence
of anthropogenic climate change]{.underline} -- usually considered a
pre-requisite to support for SG. Moreover, since climate change is a
subtle phenomenon to observe in abstract, populations rely upon
second-hand information to understand its causes and effects. Given that
the country's political polarisation is increasingly reflected in
bifurcated news consumption, [the very existence of support for SG from
one party could feed suspicion from the other.]{.underline}

In April 2024, [[Tennessee became the first state to adopt a

Governor Bill Lee. [The legislation "prohibits the intentional
injection, release, or dispersion, by any means, of chemicals, chemical
compounds, substances, or apparatus within the borders of this state

resurgence over controversy around scientists' efforts for weather
modification and geoengineering.

### Politics -- Link Turns Case

#### Political opposition to the plan would gut deployment -- makes a rollback inevitable 

Andy **Parker** **and** Peter **Irvine**, March **2018**, \[Parker works
at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam,
Germany; Irvine works at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and
Applied Sciences, Harvard University\], Earth's Future, 6(3), "The Risk
of Termination Shock from Solar Geoengineering",
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017EF000735,
mm

So far, the paper has only considered factors that could force cessation
of SRM where there was a continuing commitment to maintaining it. [It is
also possible that termination would be a political choice]{.underline}.
We assume that it would be widely understood how damaging a termination
shock would be, such that no party would bring on termination shock out
of ignorance. However, [politicians vehemently opposed to geoengineering
could come to power]{.underline}, there could be a revolution, or a
coalition of countries might decide that they were suffering
unacceptable harms from SRM and push for it to be stopped. Figure 3
outlines the pathway from political opposition to SRM through to
termination shock. First, actors opposed to SRM would need to gain
sufficient power to force an end to deployment within their own
jurisdictions. It would also need to be the case that they preferred
termination shock to other forms of SRM deployment (such as a different
technique, different aerosol spraying locations, or different aerosol
type), or to any form of slower phasing out of deployment. Finally, they
would need to have the power to impose their will for termination on all
other parties, all around the world, even those who wanted to maintain
SRM. A number of different policies might be able to reduce the drivers
of elective termination. In particular, decision-making mechanisms that
reduced possible grievances over the impacts of SRM, or over the
decision to deploy it in the first place, would reduce the level of
antipathy to an ongoing geoengineering deployment. Making sure that
deployment was agreed as widely as possible and was supported by strong
support for adaptation and compensation regimes could help reduce
injustices and perceptions of injustice. Slowly ramping up the SRM
cooling, with extensive environmental monitoring before and after
deployment, could reduce the risks of damaging environmental effects
being discovered only after the point where termination shock had become
possible. The development of alternative SRM techniques or deployment
methods, which might maintain cooling while avoiding given environmental
drawbacks, could allow the SRM system to be modified to reduce undesired
impacts. Finally, [stopping SRM need not involve termination shock, as
parties pushing for an end to SRM might be open to a gradual phase out
of deployment]{.underline}, reducing the rate of temperature change and
hence the impacts of termination (Irvine et al., 2012).

### Security K -- Link

#### Proposals for Arctic geoengineering are inherently securitized -- justifications for intervention are built on faulty assumptions that construct the Arctic as a global security threat

Nikolaj **Kornbech**, Olaf **Corry**, **and** Duncan **McLaren**,
**2024**, Cooperation and Conflict, 60(2), "Securing the 'great white
shield'? Climate Change, Arctic security and the geopolitics of solar
geoengineering,"
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00108367241269629, mm

[We analyse]{.underline} both [Arctic geoengineering]{.underline}
schemes and state strategies for the Arctic [as security
imaginaries]{.underline}. This concept draws on Charles Taylor's (2004)
notion of the social imaginary, 'the ways people imagine their social
existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between
them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the
deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations'
(p. 23). [Imaginaries]{.underline}, in this sense, [are
worldviews]{.underline} -- sets of assumptions [that may or may not
correspond to social reality but affect it in significant and material
ways]{.underline}. They are not simply subjective constructions to be
weighed against some objective reality, but (often competing) ways of
constructing and institutionalising the world. Following Pretorius
(2008), [a security imaginary is then 'that part of the social imaginary
as "a map of social space" that is specific to society's common
understanding and expectations about security and makes practices
related to security possible']{.underline} (p. 112). Regrettably, social
imaginaries are often theorised through 'internalism': as if a society
is determined by factors originating within that society alone
(Rosenberg, 2016).3 This makes it difficult to explain why different
societies often have similar security imaginaries. By breaking with
internalism, national imaginaries can be understood as inherently
international in the sense that they are deeply affected by coexistence
with other societies. For Pretorius (2008), 'the security imaginary is .
. . open to influence from perceptions, beliefs and understandings of
other societies about security' due to 'trans-societal exchanges' such
as travel (p. 112). But in a deeper way, the mere existence of multiple
societies is fundamental to the whole idea of (national) security
(Rosenberg, 2016). In addition, if the Arctic is considered a 'regional
security complex' (Lanteigne, 2016) such that the security imaginary of
societies in a region 'cannot be reasonably analysed or resolved
independently of each other' (Buzan and Wæver, 2003: 44), then relations
between societies become constitutive, even, of security imaginaries of
that region. Scientific communities -- in this case geoengineering
researchers -- can produce a different 'map of social space' from
national ones, since the groups (in one version 'epistemic communities'
(Haas, 1992)) producing these are not necessarily national, and use
different tools and concepts than national security communities. At the
same time, scientists are rarely unaffected by their backgrounds, and
their technical and conceptual tools for producing such a 'map' reflect
traces from state priorities and international structures, including
colonial legacies (Mahony and Hulme, 2018). State and scientific
security imaginaries are thus distinct but not separate, and as we shall
see, they can clash or draw upon each other, often implicitly. The
security imaginary concept captures three important characteristics of
our empirical materials. First, [geoengineering ideas and state security
strategies are performative]{.underline} (rather than purely
descriptive) [in their anticipation of (Arctic) futures]{.underline}
(Anderson, 2010). Second, [they are based on understandings of social
order which merge factual and normative claims]{.underline} -- what is
and what should be (Taylor, 2004). Third, [they construct
threats]{.underline} and necessary responses [in terms of the security
of that social order]{.underline}, irrespective of whether those threats
are of a military nature or otherwise (e.g. a climatic threat); [in
other words, they can securitise a variety of referent
objects]{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998). In investigating scientific
and state security imaginaries, we focus on the difference in the
construction of two objects: climate and the international order. We
ask: how is the 'Arctic climate' articulated and made legible in
relation to the planetary climate and other factors, and further, how is
the Arctic climate problematised and related to concerns of desirable or
undesirable futures? What political, economic and international
infrastructures are presumed? In sum, what threatens and what defends
Arctic and international order? [To explore the security imaginaries of
Arctic geoengineering, we gathered materials that construct Arctic
futures through searches in the peer-reviewed literature]{.underline}
with the search terms 'Arctic' and 'geoengineering' using Web of
Science, as well as search hits on the term 'Arctic' in the archive of
the Climate Engineering Newsletter run by the Kiel Earth Institute,4
which also covers grey literature and press coverage on the topic.5 We
manually excluded texts exclusively focused on carbon removal forms of
geoengineering, except those with positive effects on the surface
albedo. [For the state security imaginaries of the Arctic, we consulted
policy documents and other official government publications looking for
the most recent policy statement in each of the littoral
states]{.underline}: Canada, the United States, Russia, Norway and
Denmark (which controls the security and foreign policy of Greenland)
concerning their respective Arctic security strategy.6 [Public documents
are often used as data in security studies as testaments to state
preferences or intentions,]{.underline} despite the often performative
character of such documents. Such documents generally attempt to portray
the institutions that produce them as competent and coherent -- and of
value to particular external audiences. As such they are potentially
unreliable as sources for underlying intentions, levels of capacity and
commitment behind policy goals. However, as documents set out to perform
a future which is seen as desirable -- either by the authors themselves
or the audiences they appeal to -- [they are a useful guide to the
underlying assumptions of social and international order guiding Arctic
security politics]{.underline} -- the state security imaginaries, in
other words. We therefore study them for their performative content,
with particular emphasis on the intended audiences and messages (Coffey,
2014). Similarly, [geoengineering publications]{.underline} also
[perform a material and political Arctic future to advance scientific or
research agendas]{.underline}, [and we]{.underline} therefore [analyse
the underlying imaginary of their desired futures]{.underline}, without
prejudice to the climatological or technical feasibility of the
envisioned schemes. However, [as the imaginaries of many researchers
typically invoke global benefits from Arctic
geoengineering,]{.underline} in particular through preventing tipping
events, [it bears mentioning that recent literature questions these
benefits. Research indicates that that some techniques]{.underline} (ice
restoration in particular) [would have limited impacts on the global
climate]{.underline} (Van Wijngaarden et al., 2024; Webster and Warren,
2022; Zampieri and Goessling, 2019), **[and a recent comprehensive
review finds only limited support for the claim that Arctic sea ice is a
tipping element in the climate system]{.underline}** (Lenton et al.,
2023: 58--60, 66--68). Even so, it should not be assumed that scientific
considerations alone will drive decisions to geoengineer the Arctic, and
the growing interest in these ideas makes it important to examine their
political imaginaries. Finally, we must acknowledge the highly
consequential difference in the power to securitise between the actors
which produce the imaginaries. The state apparatuses producing the state
security imaginaries are more aligned with, and therefore more likely to
influence, actors with the power to securitise (Floyd, 2021). We read
both sets of imaginaries in this light. In geoengineering studies and
policy papers, the Arctic is foremost understood as a part of the global
climate system (Corry, 2017a), with focus placed on potential tipping
points in terms of alarming above-average warming, the sea ice albedo
feedback and the potential release of methane and carbon dioxide from
thawing permafrost or undersea clathrates. These may push the Earth into
feedback cycles of further warming. The Arctic is therefore seen as a
'great white shield' for the global climate, but a fragile one: 'the
weakest link in the chain of climate protection' (Zaelke, 2019: 241).
[Many of those advocating exploration of Arctic geoengineering argue
that emissions cannot be reduced in time to prevent tipping
points]{.underline}. One paper contends that cryospheric tipping points
'are essentially too late to address by standard political processes
\[for climate management\]' (Moore et al., 2021: 109). This pessimistic
assessment spawns a complementary opposite: hopes that geoengineering
might prove especially feasible and desirable in the Arctic, with
associated aspirations for near-term experimentation and potential
deployment. One researcher coined the term 'Arctic Premium', arguing
that the particular climatic characteristics of the region will enable
'a dividend for regionally based climate interventions that could be
less expensive, more effective and achieve faster results than if they
were targeted over the whole earth' (Littlemore, 2021: 2) -- the Arctic
imagined as an effective and relatively accessible lever for operating
on the global climate system as a whole.7 While regional benefits such
as the preservation of ice-dependent Indigenous ways of life are
sometimes mentioned (Moore et al., 2021: 110), this tends to occur when
regional benefits align with what are understood as global climatic
interests. This instrumental attitude can also be seen in proposals
that, echoing some of the early literature on SG (Lane et al., 2007;
Robock et al., 2008), see the Arctic as a testing ground. These include
'SCoPEx', which would have tested SAI equipment over Indigenous Sámi
land, and the suggested use of the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier in Greenland
-- Inuit territory -- as a prototype for more substantial glacial
geoengineering in the Antarctic. The Sermeq Kujalleq proposal is
justified on the basis of 'fewer global environmental impacts', despite
the considerable amount of local socio-environmental impacts and
acknowledgement that 'the reactions of local people would be mixed'
(Moore et al., 2018: 304). In a quote that sums up the assessment of
most researchers Bodansky and Hunt (2020) argue that 'as bad as Arctic
melting is for the Arctic itself, its global effects are more
concerning' (p. 601). [The concern with global effects infuses
scientific security imaginaries with urgency.]{.underline} [The
ostensible 'speed']{.underline} (Zaelke, 2019: 244) [of SG is contrasted
with the slowness of politics]{.underline}, emissions reductions and
large-scale carbon removal.8 In many cases, such invocations of urgency
lead to claims that geoengineering is necessary: that 'excluding polar
ice restoration could make the 1.5° C goal impossible to achieve' (Field
et al., 2018: 883) or that 'more and more people see geoengineering as a
necessity more than an option, making it a matter of when rather than
if' (Barclay, 2021: 4). [One proposal notes that 'these are]{.underline}
expensive propositions, but within the means of governments to carry out
[on a scale comparable to the Manhattan Project']{.underline} (Desch et
al., 2017: 121); others also specify funding by rich states as the way
to move forward on research and deployment (Moore et al., 2021). [The
urgent threat of Arctic climate change is seen as a job for decisive
state action]{.underline}, and thus, it is argued to be salient in so
far as it appears as a universal threat to state interests. At the same
time, the causes of climate change are downplayed and depoliticised
across the literature. Attributing climate change to emissions from
'human societies' (Beer et al., 2020: 1), the literature frames out the
vastly unequal responsibility for climate change and the social and
economic dynamics driving historical and continued emissions.9 One
policy paper neglects social causes of climate change altogether,
contrasting geoengineering only to 'conventional mitigation policies'
(Bodansky and Hunt, 2020: 597) and 'decarbonisation of the global
economy' (p. 616). **[In this way, Arctic climate change is constructed
as a global security threat]{.underline}**, seen as stemming from the
'tight couplings within global systems, processes, and networks'
(Miller, 2015: 278) rather than the actions of any specific group of
humans, and as a threat to global 'human security' and therefore not
subject to the division and distrust of international politics. [In
this, the imaginary resembles much liberal environmentalism in
International Relations, characterised by a 'global cosmopolitanism'
which does not seriously engage with inequalities of power and
intersocietal difference]{.underline} (Chandler et al., 2018: 200).

#### Idealistic scenarios for solar geoengineering discount the influence of political actors -- justifications for deployment are bound up in securitized logics 

Olaf **Corry**, Duncan **McLaren**, **and** Nikolaj **Kornbech**,

power politics: How security expertise reframes solar geoengineering,"

The world faces a deep and widening gap between scientifically informed
and globally agreed temperature targets, and continued emissions driving
up atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. While for Liberal
Institutionalists this might still be resolved with redesigned
international institutions (despite underlying economic and geopolitical
drivers), others have recently turned to Realism for inspiration. Some
see the structure of the international system as an explanation of
policy failure4 or search for ways forward on climate change more
attuned to the primacy of nationalism in world politics.5 Others aim to
marry a realist starting point with a progressive redistributive climate
stance.6 Classical Realism has also been mobilised in search of climate
strategies based on an collective notion of long-term 'national
interest' expanded to include the global climate and future
generations.7 While a welcome diversification, such recourses to Realism
have focused more on power politics than on questioning
rationalist-scientific underpinnings of current climate governance. In
Scientific Man vs. Power Politics, Hans Morgenthau, while by no means
dismissing science, bemoaned what he saw as 'scientism': the illusion
that 'the social world is susceptible to rational control conceived
after the model of the natural sciences'.8 Writing against the horrors
of the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the advent of nuclear
weapons, Morgenthau argued that the embrace of a bald scientific
rationality had led to technocratic depoliticisation of world politics.9
This hampered moral restraint and self-reflection10 and catastrophically
failed to account for power politics. Despite Morgenthau's efforts,
rationalism largely triumphed in post--Second World War US social
science (and inflected his own mid-career work, as well as his
neo-realist heirs).11 Little surprise, then, that [scientistic framings
and technological fixes continue to be primary responses to]{.underline}
complex political issues today, not least [climate
change]{.underline}.12 [A striking example may be found in debates about
solar geoengineering]{.underline} or 'solar radiation modification'
(SRM) techniques. The stated rationale of SRM is to mask some effects of
excess emissions by deliberately reflecting a portion of incoming
sunlight, though this leaves root causes and other harms from greenhouse
gasses like ocean acidification untreated. As a policy originally based
on 'the grossly disappointing international political response' to
limiting emissions,13 SRM is increasingly seen as a possible option,
partly because it could ostensibly be done quickly and by a single actor
(or small coalition), bypassing the impasse of global climate
politics.14 Yet would solar geoengineering evade stubborn international
dynamics around climate change, or encounter and engender new ones?
Proposed solar geoengineering techniques include stratospheric aerosol
injection (the distribution of reflective particles in the high
atmosphere), marine cloud brightening (artificially enhancing the
numbers of cloud condensation nuclei in oceanic stratus clouds, making
their upper surfaces more reflective), surface albedo modification
(techniques to reflect more sunlight from the Earth's surface, such as
preserving or restoring ice sheets and glaciers), and, even more
speculatively, space-based sunshades (deflecting sunlight with mirrors
before it even reaches the Earth). In all cases, scientists and
engineers are investigating whether geoengineering could work as a
cooling measure, and with what probable environmental risks and
benefits.15 While such scientific ideas figure increasingly in policy
settings such as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)16
and, recently, the United States government,17 they remain primarily
rooted in a knowledge base of climate modelling and physical analogues
(notably volcanic eruptions). [Idealised scenarios of controlled
deployment of SRM presuppose]{.underline} (typically unspecified)
international governance based on scientific reasoning and (often
implicit) liberal and [rationalist understandings of the international
system]{.underline}. Uncertainties and risks are seen to be due to a
lack of accurate scientific information or faulty institutions,19 and
ethics rarely go beyond a utilitarian assessment of the balance of risks
and benefits.20 This makes for remarkable optimism in some quarters. In
one version, 'this single technology could increase the productivity of
ecosystems across the planet and stop global warming; it could increase
crop yields, particularly those in the hottest and poorest parts of the
world. It is hyperbolic but not inaccurate to call it a cheap tool that
could green the world.'21 [Such pronouncements on what SRM 'could' do
rely on discounting a host of less rational and predictable dimensions
of the world]{.underline}. As Morgenthau highlighted, scientific man
(sic) -- in this case, scientific models -- can be a dangerously
misleading guide to what really animates states and 'men' and can even
be a poor guide to reason itself.22 For Morgenthau, 'when we speak of
"the pure reason of the natural scientist", we cannot mean a reason
divorced from the irrational forces determining human behaviour'.23 But
Realism was until recently 'largely absent from discussions of solar
engineering',24 scholars deeming SRM likely 'unsuitable for use as a
standard tool of foreign policy'25 due to its unfocused and
unforeseeable physical effects. But what might the limits of scientific
mastery and political rationality imply for the feasibility and
desirability of solar geoengineering? Save a brief theoretical
exploration of solar geoengineering as a conceivable (but improbable)
'lesser evil' measure,26 this question has not been addressed from a
Classical Realist starting point -- a consequential lacuna since 'many
foreign policy decision-makers identify Realism as their primary
theoretical reference-point'.27 Rather than adopting a theoretical
'Realist' position ourselves,28 [we]{.underline} elicit and [explore
empirically how solar geoengineering science is being
'translated]{.underline}'29 [in national security settings]{.underline}.
[Notwithstanding the limitations of national security discourse on
climate change]{.underline} -- [largely overlooking how militaries
themselves contribute to climate change]{.underline}30 [and often
exaggerating the effects of climate impacts on migration and
wars]{.underline}31 -- [we open up non-ideal explorations of SRM by
asking what SRM would look like to those whose expertise is not climate
science but statecraft and security]{.underline}, and whose
institutional position is not an international (scientific) body but a
nation-state. We draw on 8 workshops with national security experts and
analyse interview responses from 19 further security professionals to
gauge how the meaning of solar geoengineering would change if security
practitioners -- rather than climate scientists -- defined its purpose
and concepts. This aims to explore a key dimension of a Classical
Realist ethos in particular, namely its critique of scientism and its
'\[counselling\] against hubris and worr\[y\] over misperception of
state intentions',32 offering an empirically grounded analysis of the
potential power politics of solar geoengineering. The following section
reviews existing knowledge on solar geoengineering, emphasising the
knowledge gap on security implications, especially as considered from
theoretical perspectives outside liberal institutionalism. Next we
introduce the study's methodology drawing on the 'translations of
security' framework,33 followed by a section which outlines the
interpretations and expectations of geoengineering among our security
actor informants. Subsequently, we discuss key themes that emerged and
consider their implications for governance and scientific research of
SRM. We argue [it is hubristic to presume that SRM would be directed
according to optimised global welfare or justice goals as typically
presumed in the climate modelling]{.underline} that has dominated
knowledge production of solar geoengineering so far. [Any attempted
development or SRM intervention is highly unlikely to be exempt from
particularistic interests, securitised logics, and geopolitical
contingencies]{.underline}.

#### SRM deployment will be overlaid onto the securitized international system -- unliteral deployment with military resources magnifies the link

[States are expected to differ over the optimum setting for the 'global
thermostat']{.underline} and, perhaps more importantly, over the
appropriate combination of geoengineering and emissions cuts,
particularly concerning the level of continued fossil fuel exploitation
thus enabled. But we also heard expectations among interviewees of a
very clear divergence between the interests of certain states, each
wanting to secure a central role in governance for themselves, to the
exclusion of broader multilateral representation. [Contestation over
access to the technology]{.underline} and appropriate observation and
monitoring [was seen as likely]{.underline}. [This could be exacerbated
by the possible role of **military assets in any delivery of
geoengineering**,]{.underline} as well as the existing dual-use purposes
of Earth-system monitoring programs such as the EU's Copernicus Earth
observation programme.110 While some leading geoengineering modellers
have appealed to 'smaller democracies' to take a lead in research and
development alongside the USA,111 intimating an acceptable 'we' of
liberal hegemony leading future governance, such a configuration could
fuel governance struggles foreseen by security experts. Moreover, if
'security' becomes the primary concern, governance structures cannot be
based on the idea that states are motivated primarily by environmental
goals. While our respondents were concerned about the security impacts
of climate change, the interview evidence suggests greater concern about
solar geoengineering having negative, disruptive impacts on geopolitics
(at least for the near term) than confidence in it reducing the negative
security implications of climate change. Solar geoengineering -- it
would appear -- is seen so far both as exceptional in security terms and
less predictable (if not necessarily more severe) than the effect of
climate change itself. While the [emergent]{.underline} [security
framings]{.underline} uncovered here do leave space [for]{.underline}
[the hope that geoengineering]{.underline} research and deployment
[could be]{.underline} internationally regulated and [a space for
collaboration]{.underline}, and even peace-building,112 in part such
hope [rests upon a possibility that states' shared]{.underline}
dependence [on]{.underline} the globally interconnected
[climate]{.underline} system [provides a foundation for
cooperation]{.underline}. However, as IR scholars have argued,
[interconnectedness]{.underline} [can also be a source]{.underline} of
conflict because it involves vulnerabilities and opportunities for power
politics.113 [Greater connectivity]{.underline} in other spaces -- such
as global trade, migration, and the internet -- [has confounded
optimistic Liberal expectations]{.underline} by becoming both a means
and source of antagonistic conflict in an 'age of un-peace'.114 [The
idea that 'global realism' could emerge in response to common planetary
threats like]{.underline} nuclear weapons and [climate
change]{.underline}115 [has circulated amongst scholars]{.underline}
since the emergence of nuclear weapons, [though **the odds seem to be
stacked against**]{.underline}. [Our interviewees tended]{.underline} to
view solar geoengineering instead as already inherently linked to wider
patterns of competition and [saw geoengineering as a potential source
of]{.underline} leverage (or [blackmail]{.underline}). [Efforts to
securitise the climate by blaming 'the other' are not new]{.underline}
-- consider President Trump's claims of climate change as a 'Chinese
hoax', or Russian propaganda on 'US climate weapons' noted above. Rather
than circumventing the international, [geoengineering technologies would
be overlaid onto -- and may accelerate -- existing processes of
'othering']{.underline} (of other states, of migrants or others)
[allowing climate instability to be blamed on others']{.underline}
[(non-)deployment of such technology]{.underline}.116 The more research
moves into the physical domain through outdoor experiments and
engineering trials, the more likely that prospects of geoengineering as
a security tool will gain traction in the entangled power--knowledge
space of climate science and military planning. Implied optimistic
visions of controllable geoengineering for the global good are assumed
in climate model studies, but, especially if defined as a 'climate
security' measure, [our interviews suggested that in the
USA,]{.underline} for example, [SRM would be viewed in the context of US
strategic doctrine]{.underline} (maintaining overall dominance for the
USA and its allies). The USA could seek cooperation with other global
powers or cultivate client states, treating climate and climate
engineering as a peace-building (or co-optation) opportunity, but
[interviewees' expectations were more that unilateral US
investment]{.underline} in research [would **provoke tensions** and **a
capabilities race** with Russia or China]{.underline}.

[Realism is increasingly called upon in climate IR to better
understand]{.underline} the [security challenges]{.underline} involved

conceived in globalist and rationalist terms. [[Given failing]{.mark}
multilateral [mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}

plausible and ethically palatable, and what conflicts and tragedies are

underexamined]{.mark} and largely speculative]{.underline}, [with a
tendency to go with]{.underline} [scientistic, rationalist
presumptions]{.underline}. [Our findings suggest [SRM might align poorly
with global utilitarian climate purposes]{.mark}, especially once
security experts apply frames and concepts from their own area of
expertise]{.underline}. [Our security experts' responses to solar
geoengineering reveal ways that [security agencies]{.mark} can be
anticipated to initially engage. They [may respond differently]{.mark}
[once]{.mark} more detailed [proposals]{.mark} [for]{.mark}

[[these concerns suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the very least,
plausible [[pathways to securitisation and militarisation of
SRM]{.mark},]{.underline} regardless of the technical difficulty of
direct weaponisation. Security actors produce a distinctive articulation
of 'solar geoengineering' different from those of climate science and
climate policy analysts. Questions of control, predictability, and
attribution feature in scientific exploration of geoengineering --
aiming for greater certainty -- but these issues take on different
meanings when translated into security contexts. [When geoengineering is
understood as difficult to target, predict, and attribute, [security
experts anticipate]{.mark} that [its development would exacerbate
geopolitical tensions]{.mark} and distrust;]{.underline} if climate
science suggests geoengineering would be feasible to control, target,
and attribute on the other hand, security concerns about possible
weaponisation are raised. In either case, more geoengineering knowledge
is less a source of reliable guidance lowering climate risks, and more a
source of potential leverage, controversy, and disinformation. Security
translations of scientific SRM knowledge do not leave 'security'
unchanged however, e.g. they introduce deliberate intervention and
intentionality into the idea of 'climate security'. [In security terms,
SRM is a potential new geopolitical resource]{.underline} or deterrent,
generative of a geoengineering 'arms race' and/or mutual deterrence
outcomes. Channelling Morgenthau, [[it would be hubristic to assume that
SRM would be directed according to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} carefully
optimised [schemes of climate modellers]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
service]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} multilaterally agreed human
security or [[global justice]{.mark} goals]{.underline}. [[Any
intervention would be influenced by]{.mark} geopolitical
factors]{.underline} of urgency [and [strategic contingency]{.mark}
([including]{.mark} potentially continued interests in [delaying the
ending of fossil fuel exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}) alongside
(secondarily) the perceived security risks of climate change. [[The most
commonly predicted outcomes]{.mark} by security experts [are militarised
research]{.mark} and (eventually) deployment.]{.underline} If SRM is
'governed', this would happen primarily by mutual deterrence not
multilateral governance. Security actors do see pathways (albeit
difficult ones) to unilateral use, most likely followed by competing
uncoordinated deployment of geoengineering and counter-geoengineering
tools.

If [Arctic SRM]{.underline} \[solar radiation modification\] did get off
the ground, it is important to ask what kind of SRM would be feasible
and how it would be implemented. In comparing the scientific literature
on SRM with state policies, we saw that both [had a heavy emphasis on
technological solutionism]{.underline}, i.e. attempting to solve complex
social problems through technological innovation. [They
also]{.underline}, although to varying degrees, [tended to see the
Arctic as a solution for problems outside of the region]{.underline} --
whether that is reducing global climate impacts or supplying energy and
minerals. [Thus, it is conceivable that states may adopt SRM in an
attempt to keep the Arctic temperature stable, but still high enough to
maintain the possibility of extractive projects and
shipping.]{.underline} If that succeeded, the Arctic climate would be
altered to serve ends outside the region itself, on the order of states
which have often acquired their Arctic territories through an interplay
between scientific exploration and colonisation.15 [It is hard to
understand such a scenario as anything other than a continuation of such
colonial projects]{.underline}. [The criticism from Indigenous
organisations over existing Arctic SRM experiments]{.underline} --
including the Saami Council-led opposition to SCoPEx and the Alaska
Native Organisations-led demand to stop the Arctic Ice Project --
[demonstrates a lack of effective inclusion of Indigenous and local
populations]{.underline} in the design and control of SRM. While some
researchers have done more to include local and Indigenous communities
in research, [the risk of any potential Arctic SRM becoming a colonial
and extractivist project remains great]{.underline}.
