# Security Updates

This file is designed to update and improve the specific versions of the
security kritik. It expands the 1NC shell for the kritik, and gives two
other versions - the Russia Threat K and the China Threat K.

The File starts with a section on the chances for war in the Arctic,
with evidence about threats and prospects for war. Then there are
sections on the Security K, the Russia Threat K, and the China Threat K.
Each of these sections has a 1NC and substantial extensions. There are
also Aff responses at the end of each section. The last section includes
unrelated items, like extensions for the Domain Awareness Aff and Neg
and the "Politics DA."

Very good work done by Ben, Baker, Lonan, Sawyer, Jocelyn, Amelia,

# Arctic War

### 

### Arctic War Inevitable

#### 1. War in the Arctic is likely - The US is not prepared for Russian or Chinese expansion into the Arctic.

**Murkins, 24 - fellow at the Arctic Institute** \[Sydney, Dec 3, the
Arctic institute, The Future Battlefield is Melting: An Argument for Why
the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/future-battlefield-melting-argument-us-must-adopt-more-proactive-arctic-strategy/
\]

[The future battlefield is melting]{.underline} and demands US
attention, [as a partnership between Russia]{.underline} and the
People's Republic [of China]{.underline} [fuels strategic
competition]{.underline} in the Arctic. Thus, the [United States must
adopt a proactive Arctic strategy]{.underline}, working [with its NATO
Allies]{.underline} to ensure that the Arctic remains stable and free
from conflict. The [US's 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines
that the United States]{.underline} ["seeks a stable Arctic region
characterized by adherence to internationally agreed upon rules and
norms."]{.underline}^1)^ To achieve a secure Arctic, the [2024 Arctic
Strategy]{.underline}, produced by the U.S. Department of Defense,
[follows a "monitor-and-respond]{.underline}" approach. However, [this
reactive strategy is inadequate.^2)^ Russia's 2022 invasion]{.underline}
of Ukraine [provides evidence that Moscow will not adhere to the current
global order]{.underline} and will continue to challenge Western
international norms wherever possible, [including in the
Arctic]{.underline}. NATO's growing appeal among European states
suggests that [NATO may also be called upon to guarantee the future of
Arctic stability]{.underline}. Instead of dividing Europe, isolating
Ukraine, and expanding its influence, [Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has
resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and its Arctic
NATO allies.]{.underline} Moreover, [NATO]{.underline}, with the
accession of Finland and Sweden, [has expanded,, and now seven out of
the eight Arctic nations are NATO members]{.underline}. [The alliance
offers an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its position
in the Arctic region while not having to go it alone]{.underline}. [The
current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters]{.underline} [Russian
and Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions]{.underline}, though [the makings
of a more effective Arctic Strategy]{.underline} [already
exist]{.underline} in the pages of the 2024 Arctic Strategy. [Washington
must build on this foundation]{.underline}, [shifting its mindset
towards the Arctic]{.underline}. [A proactive Arctic Strategy is
needed]{.underline}, in which [the United States and its NATO
partners]{.underline} [are not afraid to define the rules and laws
governing the north]{.underline}. [Critics]{.underline} of this approach
[will claim that taking a more assertive position]{.underline} in the
Arctic [will further antagonize Russia and divert important resources
from the Indo-Pacific region and China]{.underline}. [This is simply not
the case]{.underline}. [Russia and China have already taken steps to
claim and militarize the Arctic. By acting now, the US and its NATO
allies will be better positioned to counter the threat posed by Russia
and China in the Arctic and beyond.]{.underline}

#### 2. Russia and Western powers are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, increasing the risk of spiralling into conflict.

**Rumer et al, 2021 - Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at
Carnegie** \[Eugene, Richard Sokolsky, and Paul Stronski, March 29,
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Russia in the Arctic---A
Critical Examination"
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/03/russia-in-the-arctica-critical-examination?lang=en\]

Implications for U.S./NATO Policy [Mutual accusations and warnings by
NATO and Russia about the threat they pose to each other risk becoming a
self-fulfilling prophecy. The situation is similar to the classic
"security dilemma," in which states take steps to increase their
security, prompting other states to respond with their own security
measures, thereby decreasing security for the first state.72 This is
risky.]{.underline} The commitment of NATO members to each other and
Russia's vision of its security requirements, which emphasizes strategic
depth and buffers to shield it from perceived threats to the homeland,
meet toe-to-toe along the alliance's northern flank. [An outright
military conflict in the Arctic would not be confined to the region and
would prove catastrophic for both sides]{.underline}. All the Arctic
stakeholders have an obvious interest in avoiding such an outcome, as
the result of either a deliberate or an unintended escalation. The
latter is the more likely scenario and [this risk is likely to increase
as the opposing forces continue to operate in close proximity to each
other. However, neither side has shown willingness to back
down]{.underline}. For NATO it is a matter of maintaining the
credibility of its commitment to mutual defense; for Russia, its main
adversary has advanced to the gates of the homeland and is intent on
denying the security, geopolitical, and economic claims to which it
feels entitled. [The rising tensions are not the result of mutual
misunderstandings---both sides' actions are deliberate and reflect
clashing interests]{.underline}.

#### 3. Russia is militarizing the Arctic - more access means more ships which makes miscalculation more likely

**Boulègue, 2022 - Senior Research Fellow, Russia and Eurasia
Programme** \[Mathieu, 6-6-2022; Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank; \"The militarization of Russian polar politics: 07
Conclusion and policy recommendations\";
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/06/militarization-russian-polar-politics/07-conclusion-and-policy-recommendations\]

[Russia's increasingly militarized posture in polar affairs has two main
consequences for Arctic coastal states]{.underline} and for the future
of the ATS: [it creates the potential for accidents and miscalculations,
and will require policies to deal with Russia--China interaction at both
poles.]{.underline} Miscalculation, accidents and tactical errors
[Russian stakeholders remain convinced that NATO is deliberately moving
closer to Russia's Arctic]{.underline} and that ATS claimant states are
not respecting Moscow's interests in the Antarctic region. [This
situation increases the risk of miscalculation and tactical errors,
which could lead to unwanted escalation.]{.underline} Polar
miscalculations At the South Pole, risks of miscalculation are linked to
Russia's increased presence and assertive posture regarding other
parties to the ATS (see Chapter 5). These are longer-term prospects but
could force the Kremlin to adopt a comprehensive and combined approach
to both poles. Indeed, a similar pattern is slowly emerging between
security issues in the Arctic and Antarctic regions -- largely as a
result of increased human activity. [In the Arctic,]{.underline} the
equation is simple: [under the impact of climate change, greater human
access to,]{.underline} and presence in, [Arctic waters (whether for
commercial, civilian or military purposes) will increase the number and
frequency of accidents and incidents both at sea]{.underline} and in the
air. [This will]{.underline}, in turn, [raise the risk of
miscalculation]{.underline}. [A greater number of surface vessels,
underwater systems and aerial platforms in the European Arctic and
Pacific Arctic -- coupled with extreme weather events and the non-linear
nature of climate change -- will make day-to-day activities such as
patrols and constabulary missions harder to manage. The Arctic is also
not immune to environmental and safety risks, notably from
nuclear-powered vessels and those carrying nuclear
missiles]{.underline}.120 This is equally true for the Southern Ocean.
[The situation is made worse by the reduction in official channels of
communication with Russia since 2014 and further deterioration since
early 2022]{.underline}. [Russia's behaviour and lack of restraint
generally are also causes for concern]{.underline} -- from its lack of
transparency in dealing with serious environmental events121 to its
military activities in peacetime. The latter include dangerous
manoeuvres against Norwegian assets;122 ADIZ violations against Japan
and South Korea; GPS-jamming in northern Finland and Norway during the
NATO 'Trident Juncture' exercise in 2018;123 snap missile drills;124 and
other military activity taking place beyond the AZRF.125 These
activities particularly impact the overall security of the Barents,
Norwegian and Bering Seas (see Chapters 2--4 for discussion of existing
chokepoints). [The risk of miscalculation is compounded by Russia's need
to 'respond' to the expansion of NATO in the European
Arctic]{.underline} (Finland and Sweden potentially joining the alliance
being a case in point)126 and NATO's supposed activities directed
against the AZRF, as well as the increased US presence in the Pacific
theatre.127 For the US, NATO and their allies[, an additional risk is
that their regional military assets could be threatened by Russian
systems, and particularly by naval aviation groups and air-superiority
assets, long-range missile systems and strategic bomber
overflights]{.underline}.

#### 4. Militarization of the Arctic guarantees conflict escalation and global war because there are no diplomatic institutions in the Arctic

**Foizee, 2016 - a Threat/Risk Intelligence Analyst** \[Bahauddin, Sept
8, Eurasia Review, "Pursuit Of Arctic Supremacy: Hotspot For Another
Larger Conflict,"
https://www.eurasiareview.com/08092016-pursuit-of-arctic-supremacy-hotspot-for-another-larger-conflict-oped/\]

[With the rapid melting of ice in the Arctic region, the long-isolated
region is becoming a more accessible zone for commercial fishing, fresh
water, minerals, coal, iron, copper, oil, gas, and shipping. Thus, the
region is increasingly catching the world powers'
attention.]{.underline} [Arctic states]{.underline} -- Canada, Denmark
(via Greenland), Russia, Norway and the U.S. -- [are in rush to
exploit]{.underline} [all these opportunities from]{.underline} [the
region,]{.underline} [which is believed to hold huge oil and natural gas
resources.]{.underline} [With such lust for resources, there is the
likelihood that the slow militarization,]{.underline} [which has already
been initiated by the stake-holding states,]{.underline} [will be
intensified, jeopardizing the peace and stability of the region and the
globe.]{.underline} Disputes The Arctic region is located around the
North Pole and surrounded by landmasses of the aforementioned five
countries. Since the Arctic region was "inaccessible" until the end of
20th century because of the layers of thick ice, there were less
territorial disputes until the beginning of this (21st) century.
However, ice are melting rapidly in the Arctic region because of the
global warming, clearing this ice-covered region from ice. [The ice of
the region is already reduced by as much as 50% from
1950s.]{.underline} The region is warming faster than other areas across
the globe. Such rapid melting of ice is making the region a more
"accessible" zone. [The melting of the sea ice has been opening up trade
routes]{.underline} (during the summers) [between Asia and
Europe]{.underline} [through the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}; the same
region where such trades routes were unimaginable even couple of decades
ago. In 2007, the Northwest Passage between the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans opened for the first time in memory. [The constant change in the
climate and the increasing accessibility to the region would make the
extraction of oil and gas from the region much easier. Estimations from
different corners reveal that the region is speculated to hold oil
reserves of upto 13% of the global total of undiscovered oil, upto 30%
of natural gas, and also other precious metals.]{.underline} Such
'speculations' and 'accessibility' have given rise to plenty of disputes
that have emerged among the aforementioned five countries surrounding
the region. However, among those disputes, the most intensified ones
are: (i) regarding boundaries in the Beaufort Sea and the status of the
Northwest Passage between the U.S. and Canada, (ii) regarding Hans
Island between Canada and Denmark (via Greenland), (iii) regarding the
Lomonosov Ridge -- a mountain range across the region --- among Canada,
Denmark and Russia, (iv) and regarding the maritime border from the
Bering Sea into the region between the U.S. and
Russia. [Therefore,]{.underline} [all countries surrounding the region
are involved in disputes regarding the ownership and control over
different parts of the region.]{.underline} Alongwith these five Arctic
countries, [China and the UK are also involved in the
dispute]{.underline} [through their claims]{.underline} over the
Svalbard archipelago, which happens to be within the region. Some of the
Arctic countries that are claimant to the disputes have been attempting
to come to a solution through the Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) and the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS). However, a constructive solution, which would bind all
the claimants to the Arctic disputes to abide by it, could not be
reached through these CLCS and UNCLOS. This is because, [both CLCS and
UNCLOS lack the appropriate mandate from countries across the world,
including the aforesaid five Arctic countries, to impose "legally
binding" decisions or provisions for any maritime disputes.
Therefore,]{.underline} [the absence of a binding legal regime creates
scopes for intense territorial and maritime
disputes]{.underline} [concerning the control, exploration and
exploitation of the energy resources in such a region that is becoming
increasingly accessible for such purpose]{.underline} (i.e. purpose of
energy exploration and exploitation). Militarization In the prevailing
scenario, all the Arctic countries, which are involved in the
territorial and maritime disputes among themselves, have been moving
towards militarizing the region in order to acquire each of their
respective objectives in the region. Norwegian foreign secretary Jonas
Gahr Stoere already expressed that the presence of "military, navy and
coastguard" in the region is necessary. Canada has planned a deep water
"naval facility" at Nanisivik, which lies at the entrance to the
disputed Northwest Passage. Canada promised (under former PM Stephen
Harper's administration) to build armed ice-breakers, several patrol
ships and several vessels in order to proceed towards gripping the
Arctic. [In 2011,]{.underline} [Canada conducted large-scale "military
exercises" in the region.]{.underline} In August 2015, the U.S.
permitted Shell to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea, which falls within
the periphery of Alaskan Arctic. The U.S. "Coast Guard" has already
deployed "sophisticated ships, aircrafts and other maritime assets" in
the Alaskan Arctic for the duration of Shell's drilling in the Arctic.
Through such presence, [the U.S. is]{.underline} [not only trying to
exploit energy resources of the Arctic region, but also trying to keep
its "military presence" deep inside the region.]{.underline} On the
otherside, in 2007, Russian scientists dived to the seabed in the Arctic
Ocean and planted a titanium Russian flag (Russia claimed that it was
flag of Russia's ruling party) in order to beef up their
claims[.]{.underline} [Russia has already moved to restore a Soviet-era
"military base" and other "military outposts" in the Arctic. In early
2015,]{.underline} [Russia exercised Arctic "military patrols" from its
Northern Fleet, involving "38,000 servicemen, more than 50 surface ships
and submarines and 110 aircrafts".]{.underline} More
interestingly, [Russia is currently planning to jointly explore for oil
in Russia's Arctic fields with China, which is increasingly becoming a
strong "military power" besides being an economic giant]{.underline}.
Through such move, Russia is trying to make sure that Russia has a
"rising military power" like China involved into its stake in the Arctic
region so that such cooperation favours Russia at the time of escalation
of any "military conflict". Wrapping Up As of yet, the Arctic region is
largely untouched by mankind. However, with the ice caps melting, access
to the Arctic oil and gas reserves, which is estimated to be worth
hundreds of billions of dollars, will become easier -- a prediction that
has already sparked a military competition in the region. [Such
militarization of the region is likely to increase with almost all the
countries urging for increasing their military deployments and
exercises, and there appears little hope and opportunity for any
diplomatic resolution (or political agreement) regarding the
disputes.]{.underline} [It can be well presumed that without any
diplomatic resolution (or political agreement),]{.underline} [the
current non-hostile debate over the Arctic could turn into a violent
confrontation.]{.underline} It seems our globe does not lack reasons to
engage in chaos. The two world wars began as European conflicts, only to
turn gradually into world wars. Likewise, i[f the
disputes]{.underline} [over the control of the Arctic
resources]{.underline} [are not resolved quickly, it could turn into a
larger military conflict that would]{.underline} [not just involve the
Arctic countries, but would also]{.underline} [drag a larger part of the
world into]{.underline} [this]{.underline} [conflict. And for sure, the
start of such war would mean the cold, yet beautiful, Arctic region
would become the targets of war machines-- destroying the environment
and the stability of the region and the globe.]{.underline}

China increased its Arctic presence immediately after a U.S. Coast Guard

The U.S. Naval Institute
[reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/09/03/chinese-icebreaker-mission-to-arctic-clear-signal-of-beijings-polar-ambitions-says-expert)
last week that [China has successfully used the Northern Sea Route
(NSR]{.underline}), [an Arctic passage controlled primarily by Russia
and long-anticipated as an alternative to the Suez]{.underline}, to
carry Russian goods bound for Europe and Asia[. The opening of the NSR
presents an economic opportunity as a safer maritime trade route -- and
a dangerous opportunity for Russia to exert strategic control over a
critical maritime chokepoint.]{.underline} The NSR runs through the
Arctic Sea from the Barents Sea in the West to the Bering Strait in the
East. [The NSR connects East Asian manufacturing centers with European
consumer markets]{.underline}. Merchants have long eyed the NSR as an
alternative shipping route to avoid congestion in the Strait of Malacca,
piracy in the Horn of Africa, and instability in the Suez Canal and
Middle East. They had long hoped it could cut transit times by weeks,
despite shallow, icy, foggy waters that are impassible for much of the
year. [Russia has long viewed the NSR's potential to move Arctic oil and
gas]{.underline} to Western and Eastern markets[. Russia is also the
only one of the eight Arctic nations that is not a member of NATO, and
Russia has used]{.underline}
[lawfare](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3525442)[,
the use of law to achieve a strategic objective, to safeguard its
strategic interests accordingly]{.underline}. [Russia interprets the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in a way that
is not commonly accepted by states to enlarge its territorial
sea]{.underline}. [It further claims that the waters of three large
archipelagos twenty miles off the Russian coast are Russian internal
waters]{.underline}, [allowing it to use them as maritime choke points
and assert illegal and excessive maritime claims over the entire NSR.
Russia can then use these waters to restrict entry, charge tariffs, and
impose regulations on ships transiting through the NSR. Russia has also
attempted to exercise control]{.underline} over the NSR [by instituting
strict regulations on pollution and shipping safety]{.underline}.
[UNCLOS grants states the ability to regulate pollution, including
indirect pollution prevention by way of safety and navigation rules to
lower the risk of accidents and oil spills, in ice-covered parts of
their exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where severe climate conditions
create navigational hazards or could cause major environmental harm.
Russia applies regulations that are significantly stronger than
generally accepted international standard]{.underline}s. These include
mandatory insurance and icebreaker escorts, both of which are expensive
and exclusively controlled by Russia. [These and other regulations allow
Russia to assert stringent control over its illegal maritime
claims---and to ]{.underline}[threaten

#### 6. Russia has become Certain of Western intentions in the Arctic, and has portrayed the US as hostile - this makes conflict inevitable

Arctic"

1 Introduction After the Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea,
[Russia and NATO seem locked in a pattern of escalating
tension]{.underline}. With talk of a new Cold War, even an arms race,
[the re-militarization of Europe is underway, also in the Arctic. The
low-tension space between Russia and NATO has rapidly been supplanted by
military exercises, bases and installations]{.underline}, all growing in
number and scope. Whereas security experts and [bureaucracies on both
sides have engaged in measuring the "threat" in objective terms, often
taking for granted the hostile intent of the adversary]{.underline},
this article examines how the understanding of the other as hostile and
threatening has (re-) emerged. We see the social interaction between the
parties as the fundamental driver in conflictual relations, with the
material manifestations of such relations being re-armament and military
posturing enabled by inimical identifications. The spiral of rising
tension in Europe is part of a broader Russia--West interaction pattern
which can be theorized as a process of mutual and multifaceted
securitization,1 but we focus on Russia, investigating the changing
identifications of NATO in the wider context of self/other
representations in Russian official texts. We theorize and empirically
investigate the changing pattern in post-Crimea official statements on
the strategic adversary and how such general securitization spills over
into Russia's framing of NATO in the Arctic. Thereby [we
address]{.underline} a neglected aspect in discussions on the emerging
Russia-West security dilemma(s): [how uncertainty about the intent
behind the other party's military build-up2 has dissolved and become
certainty.]{.underline} Some scholars see the basic objectives of NATO
and Russia in the Arctic as defensive, and explain the "tragic"
action/reaction pattern in military build-up now unfolding with
reference to longstanding psychological, bureaucratic and political
biases and assumptions,3 or a general lack of trust.4 While
acknowledging that historical animosity is relevant, we disagree with
both the weight that it is given, as well as shallow accounts of how
today's distrust is (re-) produced. We argue that [the power of recent
political speech -- including rhetoric that invokes]{.underline}
historical [animosity -- must be considered in explaining how parties
replace strategic uncertainty about the intent behind the other party's
actions with certainty of hostile intent -- thus contributing to the
action/reaction dynamic involving military activities and potentially
leading to armed conflict.]{.underline}5 Moreover, [spillover of
strategic certainty from one area (Ukraine]{.underline}/Black Sea) [to
another (Arctic) occurs as a result of a discursive process in which the
Other has been naturalized as a total threat.]{.underline} Empirically,
our study contributes fresh insight into a main protagonist on the
rapidly changing European scene, as well as how Russia's expressed views
on NATO might affect relations in the Arctic. The Arctic has long been
considered a strategic low-tension zone, featuring cross-cutting
institutions focused on non-military issue-areas, with agreement on the
primacy of UNCLOS and a healthy mix of collaboration and competition in
the energy field.6 Even immediately after the annexation of Crimea,
Russia and NATO states remained "frenemies" in the Arctic,7 an area now
increasingly dominated by great-power rivalry where Russia--NATO
interactions are pivotal. Can the Arctic can be "compartmentalized" and
insulated from broader developments in Russia--West relations?8 By
reviewing a large body of Russian official texts on NATO since 2014 and
examining how relations in the Arctic are re-read in light of this
broader discursive change, we indicate how [compartmentalization could
be challenged by Russian strategic certainty of NATO's hostile
intent]{.underline}. We start by presenting our theoretical assumptions
and methodology as to the relevance of changing official identifications
for strategic certainty and geographical spillover (2). Then follows the
result of our discourse analysis of Russian official texts. We detail
how Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Ministry of Defense (MOD)
statements represent the state of world affairs and NATO's role in
creating it (3.1), NATO's nature and intentions (3.2), and NATO's
actions (3.3). We show how ["certainty" of NATO hostility is construed
through this discourse, gradually becoming naturalized]{.underline}
(3.4). Finally, we examine Russian statements on NATO and NATO states in
the Arctic, to see whether this region can be insulated from the
overarching Russia--NATO social dynamic, and to test our empirical
expectation that [the social construction of strategic certainty puts
relations in the Arctic under pressure]{.underline} (3.5). The
conclusions sum up the findings of our empirical analysis, linking them
to the theoretical debate on how misplaced certainty originates (4).

#### 7. Russia already perceives NATO as hostile in the Arctic - our expansion is seen as "flanking" Russia

Research group for Russia, Asia and International Trade at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs.** \[Julie and Anni, Mar 9,

Arctic"
<http://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3378/6334>"\]

3.5 Spillover: NATO in the Arctic and Arctic relations [Given the
finding that NATO hostility has been naturalized as near-total in
Russian official statements]{.underline} since 2014, [we would expect
the general hostile intent and posture ascribed to NATO elsewhere to
spill over, shaping understandings of NATO in the Arctic.]{.underline}
Here we seek to uncover whether the pattern of identification of NATO
elsewhere is replicated in Russian statements on NATO in the Arctic
region. We also investigate whether the established discourse on the
Arctic as a "uniquely collaborative space" is reiterated and whether (or
not) it restrains the securitization of NATO or the level of hostility
attached to diverse Western actors in this region. [In Russian
representations of the Arctic we find a dual pattern; on the one hand,
resistance to securitization emanating from the discourse on the Arctic
as a cooperative space]{.underline} with cooperative actors; [on the
other, full "contamination" in terms of NATO hostility. Tellingly,
despite many references to NATO in a range of contexts in these Arctic
texts, we have not encountered a single instance where NATO is mentioned
in non-hostile terms]{.underline}. Further, there is evident replication
in the representations of NATO across the three analytical categories
outlined above. While the Baltic region is identified as being subjected
to "militarization" before [the Arctic]{.underline},155 in April 2015
this [region is actively framed as part of the new dangerous world which
NATO is creating.]{.underline} Defence Minister Shoigu notes that "[with
the geographical concentration of the NATO exercise areas, exclusively
on the eastern flank of the alliance and the Arctic region ... the
alliance has dropped its propaganda clichés of past years about
cooperation with Russia]{.underline}".156 NATO/USA are repeatedly
identified as the sole source of this new situation, for instance:
"Speaking about potential sources of mounting tensions in the region, it
would be logical to consider the United States and its allies' military
activities in the Arctic that go hand-in-hand with belligerent rhetoric.
In fact, NATO and NATO member states, including non-Arctic countries,
are carrying out provocations there and are doing so on an increasingly
regular basis".157

[Successful exercises can weaken Russia's and China's military
footprints.]{.underline} A [longstanding partnership between the U.S.
Marines and the Norwegian military highlights the importance of
amphibious operations to strengthen alliances]{.underline}. During the
1986 Operation Anchor Express, [Norway hosted the U.S. Fourth Marine
Amphibious Brigade]{.underline}. [Approximately 20,000 troops
representing eight countries tested the limits of their equipment in
cold weather and conducted exercises that would protect NATO's northern
flank]{.underline}.18 [The U.S. amphibious fleets continue to anchor
themselves in this relationship to reaffirm partnerships with
Scandinavian countries who specialize in Arctic operations]{.underline}.
NATO recently launched Exercise Steadfast Defender 24, the largest
Arctic drills since the Reforger Exercise in 1988[.]{.underline} One
component, Exercise Nordic Response 2024, focused on high-end amphibious
operations, including beach landings on Norwegian shores. These
exercises aim to reaffirm joint doctrine and ensure successful
operations in the Arctic's harsh environment. They establish tailored
Arctic tactics while reinforcing safety of personnel. [The Russian Navy
has also attempted amphibious exercises with the objective of showing
its tactics as superior to NATO's]{.underline}. Ocean Shield 2023
consisted of more than 30 military vessels, 20 support vessels, 30
aircraft, and 6,000 personnel. Because of a redistribution of forces to
Ukraine, however, [Russia's "Baltic Fleet has lost its ability to
conduct a large-scale offensive amphibious operation." Russia's Arctic
naval posture has weakened.]{.underline} Assemble the "A" Team. Fleet
commands consist of staffs responsible for a designated operating area.
In 1943, Admiral Ernest J. King established the Ninth Fleet Command,
which was responsible for military operations in the High North. After
World War II, the Ninth Fleet dissolved into the Atlantic numbered fleet
commands. [In 2017, Admiral James Stavridis proposed reserving the Ninth
Fleet for the High North by establishing a staff specialized in naval
operations at the northern front]{.underline}.19 [The Russian Navy's
Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command is responsible for the western
and central Arctic.]{.underline} Its naval component includes the
Northern Fleet's Submarine Command and fleet, and the Kora Flotilla's

\]

[The historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal
that the Arctic is likely to be an arena for future strategic
competition]{.underline}. [Russia's 2022 invasion]{.underline} of
Ukraine has [temporarily bolstered the West's position]{.underline} in
the Arctic, [as previously neutral Finland and Sweden joined
NATO.]{.underline} [Finland's accession]{.underline} into NATO [not only
increased the NATO-Russia land border by over 650 percent]{.underline}
[and moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from St.
Petersburg]{.underline}, but [it also contributed to creating a divided
Arctic]{.underline}, [where nearly half belongs to NATO while the
remaining half is Russian territory]{.underline}. Threatened by the
growing alliance, in June 2022, [Putin warned that if U.S.-NATO military
contingents or military infrastructure appears in either Sweden or
Finland, Russia will respond]{.underline} "symmetrically" [by deploying
nuclear weapons]{.underline} [to the Baltic Sea region]{.underline} [to
restore military balance and strengthen its defenses.]{.underline}^19)^
In February 2023, [Putin made good on this threat and deployed Russian
ships]{.underline} [armed with tactical nuclear weapons to the Baltic
Sea]{.underline}. According to Norway[, this was the first time in 30
years that this has happened]{.underline}.^20)^ Then in June 2024,
[Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in Leningrad, [a military district bordering NATO
members Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania.]{.underline}^21)^ As evidenced by these actions, [while Putin
is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber, it is not likely that Russia
has the military or economic capacity to engage in a direct conventional
conflict with NATO. NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window
of time to prepare for conflict against Russia]{.underline}. In 2024
[the head of the Norwegian armed forces warned that NATO countries only
have two to three years to prepare for a Russian attack.]{.underline}
Norwegian General Eirik Kristoffersen claims that [Moscow is building up
its military stockpile faster than previously predicted,]{.underline}
while Western nations have depleted their own weapons by supplying them
to Ukraine.^22)^ [Several other European leaders]{.underline} have
echoed these concerns[, citing that they have between three and eight
years to prepare for a Russian attack against NATO]{.underline}.^23)^
Despite Russia's aggressive rhetoric, [Moscow understands that because
of its war against Ukraine it likely will not have the capability to
attack NATO]{.underline} in the near future. For instance, [Russia
removed nearly all its ground forces from the Finnish border to Ukraine
in June 2024]{.underline}.^24)^ [Russia's timeframe to launch a
successful attack is dependent not only on its economy but also on its
partnership with the PRC.]{.underline}

#### Russian/Chinese cooperation in the Arctic gives early signs of Arctic conflict

\]

In 2021 [Russia and China renewed their 20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty
of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]{.underline}, a move
described as "an act of friendship against America."^9)^ Moreover, both
[Russia and China have deep historic and economic ties to the
Arctic]{.underline}. [NATO's expansion]{.underline} to include Finland
and Sweden [have increased tensions]{.underline} in the region, [while
both Russia and China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's
increasing presenc]{.underline}e in the Arctic.^10)^ However, despite
feeling antagonized by NATO's actions, [Moscow and Beijing may not have
the economic and military capacities to reshape the current
international rules-based order in the Arctic in the near
term]{.underline}. Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic,
[Russia controls over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline]{.underline},
[making it a decisive player in the future of the
region.]{.underline}^11)^ Yet[, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not
new.]{.underline} [Russia's connection]{.underline} with the [Arctic can
be traced back to the sixteenth century]{.underline}, [beginning with
its conquest of Siberia]{.underline}, [which was part of a larger
initiative to search for resources and trade routes]{.underline}.^12)^
As the nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well. During the Cold
War, [the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval presence on the
Kola Peninsula to project power against the U.S]{.underline}. With the
collapse of the Soviet Union, [Russia, as the de jure inheritor of the
Soviet nuclear arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic
power]{.underline}. As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s
under Vladimir Putin[, Russia began posturing for Arctic
supremacy]{.underline}, reopening multiple Soviet-era military bases[,
modernizing its navy, and developing new hypersonic missiles designed to
evade U.S. sensors and defenses]{.underline}.^13)^ Moreover, in August
2022, [Moscow announced that it would refocus its military
power]{.underline} [on the Arctic and Nordic region.]{.underline}^14)^
According to Colin Wall, [a research associate at Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, "The military balance in the
Arctic is heavily weighted towards Russia.]{.underline}" Furthermore,
the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that
[Russia's bases inside the Arctic Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a
third.]{.underline}^15)^ [Russia's remilitarization of the Arctic and
its revitalized strategic partnership with China, provides both
countries with the means to challenge the current Western rules-based
international order.]{.underline}

### \--Extend - Sea Lane Cutoffs

#### Russia is escalating its aggressive rhetoric about the Northern Sea Route, increasing the risk of miscalculation

**Boulègue, 2024 - Global Fellow at the Wilson's Center Polar
Institute** \[Mathieu, October 31, The Arctic Institute, Russia\'s
Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/\]

[The main risk of miscalculation with Russia, however, pertains to
Moscow's contestable interpretation of the legal status of the Northern
Sea Route (NSR).]{.underline} For years, the Kremlin has been projecting
the NSR as a body of internal waters covered by Article 234 of the Law
of the Sea (also known as the 'Ice Clause'), therefore offering Russian
authorities the possibility to enforce 'non-discriminatory laws and
regulations'20) over ice-covered areas. The issue is twofold. On the one
hand, [the impact of climate change]{.underline} [is completely
reshuffling access to the AZRF]{.underline}, in turn [preventing Russia
from invoking the clause to increase control over the NSR]{.underline}
because of seasonal sea-ice reduction. [On the other hand, Moscow's
application of 'non-discriminatory' rules is, in fact, highly
discriminatory]{.underline}. Indeed, for the past few years, [Russia has
been introducing stringent national regulations clearly violating
UNCLOS]{.underline} -- [for instance by strengthening navigation rules
and transit rights]{.underline} or interdicting passage to foreign
military assets21) through the NSR. Moscow seeks to appropriate the NSR
as a body of internal waters regulated by Russian law, and no longer
linked to UNCLOS under the principles of freedom of navigation and
innocent passage. This obsession for control responds to the fear of
'encirclement' in the Arctic and the unwarranted belief that NATO will
soon contest the self-appropriation of the NSR. [Russian fears have
crystallized in the belief that NATO or the United States are willing to
conduct a freedom of navigation operation]{.underline} (FONOP) through
the NSR to 'test' innocent passage in contested waters. Most of these
fears remain unfounded, especially since there is little value in
arranging such an operation as well as high operational risk.22) [The
fact remains that the Kremlin's rhetoric around a potential Western-led
FONOP has grown aggressive in recent months]{.underline}, with NATO
arguably seeking to 'snatch'23) the NSR from under Russia's control.
Furthermore, the Russian armed forces and the FSB (in charge of the
Coast Guard and Border Guard) have reportedly been making plans to
'counter'24) a potential foreign FONOP.

#### The US is dependent on Arctic oil, which leaves us vulnerable to cutoffs and shocks

\]

Energy [The US is vested in the Arctic's oil and natural
gas]{.underline}, with Alaska's Prudhoe Bay Oil Field being North
America's most prominent; in the 2000s, [Prudhoe Bay typically produced
about 8% of America's domestic oil.2]{.underline}0) [The importance of
Arctic oil to America's energy independence was demonstrated in
2006]{.underline} [when a leak in a critical pipeline at Prudhoe Bay
forced the line's shutdown while the US and Iran were in a
dispute]{.underline}. At the same time, [tensions in the Middle East
made it difficult for the US to buy reasonably priced foreign
oil]{.underline}. [The total cost of oil increased 3%
domestically.]{.underline}21) [The 2009 Arctic Region Policy aimed to
increase US oil independence]{.underline} [by accessing Alaskan oil
deposits]{.underline}. While it received support from energy
independence advocates, [it was]{.underline} [also met with resistance
from environmentalists]{.underline}, thus hindering implementation.22)
[This debate persisted over the years, shaping subsequent approaches to
Arctic resource development. The Trump administration (2021) issued
drilling leases on more than 400,000 acres in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.23]{.underline}) In contrast, [the 2022 National
Strategy]{.underline} for the Arctic [acknowledges the region's economic
reliance on hydrocarbon production while advocating for economic
diversification, a transition to green energy and environmental
protection.24)]{.underline} In 2024[, the US Department of the Interior
denied commercial access to a copper deposi]{.underline}t through Gates
of the Arctic National Park. [It banned oil drilling in half of the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska]{.underline}.25) [Environmentalists
and tribal leaders praised these decisions, but Alaska's officials
criticized them]{.underline}.26) [The relationship between
environmentalism and energy complicates the US grand
strategy]{.underline} in the Arctic, creating inconsistency due to
fluctuating politics, public opinion, and stakeholder support. [This
makes long-term planning for Arctic energy difficult]{.underline}, [as
leadership changes can shift priorities between resource extraction and
environmental protections and alter the trajectory of US Arctic
strategy]{.underline}. [Such volatility hampers coherent, long-term
policies essential for the region's energy security and ecological
sustainability]{.underline}, making it a contentious issue influenced by
electoral outcomes and shifting public opinion.

#### Conflicts could erupt over Arctic sea lanes - Russia has acted aggressively, and the US sees this as threatening

\]

[Russia has fortified the region to protect future strategic and
economic interests]{.underline}.35) [The US has interpreted this as an
attempt to achieve regional dominance,]{.underline} [prompting numerous
military operations in the area]{.underline}.36) [Moscow views US
actions as aggressive intrusions into Russian territory, which has led
to further militarization on both sides.]{.underline}37) [This ongoing
dynamic was exemplified when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed that his
fleet was prepared to secure sea lanes in the]{.underline} Atlantic and
[Arctic]{.underline}.38) A Russian Duma member responded by stating that
the US should not tempt fate and that the NSR and Arctic were Russia's
responsibility where Russian national interests are present.39) [The
current US Grand Strategy has acted firmly but lacks consistent
messaging]{.underline}. For example, in 2019, [Secretary of State Pompeo
decried Russian aggressio]{.underline}n in the Arctic, [citing their
regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic fortification, and actions in
Ukraine]{.underline}.40) However, Pompeo's message lacked specificity
about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that the US would host
military exercises and increase its presence in the Arctic.41) [The US
must ensure that its actions in the Arctic are firm, predictable,
consistent, and straightforward to avoid further escalating tensions.
The US must improve its messaging on Arctic security by clearly
communicating its policies and red lines to Russia to avoid
misinterpretations and unintended confrontations]{.underline}. However,
it's also important to recognize that the Arctic offers opportunities
for cooperation. [Enhanced communication can address immediate threats
and foster stable regional collaboration. By improving its messaging
strategy,]{.underline} [the US can more effectively navigate the complex
geopolitical landscape and reduce the risks of escalating tensions with
Russia.]{.underline}

resources expands, [states will shift strategies and intensify
competition over the Arctic's growing economic and military
significance]{.underline}. [This competition has also been driven by its
militarization.]{.underline}16) Over the past decade, [Russia has
modernized its Arctic military bases]{.underline}, [deployed defense
missiles, and upgraded its submarine fleet while developing fisheries,
petroleum, and mineral extraction.]{.underline}17[) Russia's restrictive
NSR claims have further escalated tensions]{.underline}, especially
following its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, [PRC signaled growing
ambitions having ramped up its Arctic investments]{.underline},

[These developments highlight the Arctic's evolving role in economic
opportunity and strategic rivalry, posing significant challenges to US
grand strategy.]{.underline} American Grand Strategy [The 2009 Arctic
Region Policy shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold War US Arctic
strategy, recognizing the Arctic as an emerging critical region but only
identified two focal points: energy and security.]{.underline}19) [The
2022 National Strategy]{.underline} for the Arctic Region [was
comprehensive, addressing the Pillars of security, climate
change/environmental protection, sustainable development, and
international governance]{.underline}. [Changes in the physical,

In contrast, [Europe and Japan have a more complicated view of the
NSR]{.underline}. [Following Russia's invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine,
[there was a decline in NSR transit due to sanctions on
Russia.]{.underline}53) However, by 2023, [transits had

the NSR, indicating that economic advantages often outweigh political
considerations. Shifting maritime traffic]{.underline} from the Suez
Canal [to the NSR requires the US to reevaluate trade
routes]{.underline} [and competitive strategies. As European and Asian
partners increasingly use the NSR, they will need to maintain good
relations with Russia]{.underline}, [which could limit their willingness
to oppose Russia, giving Russia a strategic advantage]{.underline}. [The

monitoring the growing partnership between Russia and the PRC in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

Corbett emphasized the value of an effective political system to achieve
sea power while deterring war. Corbettian theory echoes throughout A
Blue Arctic, the U.S. Navy's 2022 strategic blueprint for the region,
and in Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti's priorities
for the fleet. Blue Arctic aims to "maintain enhanced presence;
strengthen cooperative partnerships; and build a more capable Arctic
Naval Force." Admiral Franchetti expands on these objectives with her
priorities of warfighting, warfighters, and the foundation that supports
them. Normalizing Arctic exercises with NATO allies embodies the
Corbettian emphasis on effective political systems. [Corbett observed
that a fleet with command of the seas can "control the maritime
communications of all parties concerned."]{.underline}13 [The remote and
vast Arctic region, however, has insufficient sea lines of communication
(SLOCs)]{.underline} and undersea cables. [Tensions between Russia and
other Arctic states have indefinitely stalled SLOC projects such as the
Russia Optical Trans-Arctic Submarine Cable System, Arctic Connect, and

economic challenges aren't yet severe enough to force a quick end to the

hopes]{.underline}. "For at least the next year, [the Kremlin should be
able to keep its overheating economy from exploding into a full-blown
crisis,"]{.underline} Prokopenko said. ["Putin will likely still have
the resources to sustain his brutal campaign in Ukraine---and perhaps

[However, the consequences of the war against Ukraine have not (yet) led
to a complete strategic reassessment regarding Russia's Arctic military
posture]{.underline}. Existing strategic priorities are linked to:
Imposing cost on foreign military access to the region (ambitions of
control), Extending interdiction capabilities beyond the AZRF and
removing tension away from the Russian Arctic (ambitions of denial) and
Protecting the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and contested 'internal waters.'
Wartime adaptations If strategic priorities remain unchanged[, Russian

#### 2. Russia is securitizing the Arctic - they are using Arctic lands to establish military advantages

Superpowers Scrap for a Piece of the Arctic"
<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwqn7z02plo>)

[Russia also relies on its Arctic to store strategic weapons - mainly on
its Kola peninsula, which bristles with nuclear capabilities and is home
to its legendary Northern Fleet.]{.underline} Back in Norway, Kirkenes
residents live under that shadow of the Russian Bear next door. They
always have. The border with Russia is a 10 minutes drive away by car.
And [Kola peninsula feels uncomfortably close]{.underline}. In Cold War
times, the town became known as a nest of spies - a frontline between
the West and the Soviet Union. [Norway believes Russia is using its
Arctic to train new recruits to fight, and to fly bombers from, to
attack Ukraine. Though not directly at war with Russia,
Norway,]{.underline} and specifically the north of the country along its
roughly 200km long land border, [feels under attack.]{.underline} \"We
see it here locally,\" says Col Jørn Kviller, speaking to me by the
clear waters of the Pasvik River that separates Norway and Russia. Just
in front of us are Norway\'s bright yellow, and Russia\'s red and green,
border posts. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there have been
increasingly frequent incidents of GPS jamming that have even caused
commercial pilots to change navigation systems. Cases of espionage by
the border - \"everything from signals intelligence to agents being sent
to Norway\" - have shot up, Col Kviller tells me. [Norway and its Nato
allies are also on the alert for Russian spy submarines and other
vessels in the Arctic.]{.underline}

 

#### 3. Russia is militarizing the Arctic - more access means more ships which makes miscalculation more likely

**Boulègue, 2022 - Senior Research Fellow, Russia and Eurasia
Programme** \[Mathieu, 6-6-2022; Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank; \"The militarization of Russian polar politics: 07
Conclusion and policy recommendations\";
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/06/militarization-russian-polar-politics/07-conclusion-and-policy-recommendations\]

[Russia's increasingly militarized posture in polar affairs has two main
consequences for Arctic coastal states]{.underline} and for the future
of the ATS: [it creates the potential for accidents and miscalculations,
and will require policies to deal with Russia--China interaction at both
poles.]{.underline} Miscalculation, accidents and tactical errors
[Russian stakeholders remain convinced that NATO is deliberately moving
closer to Russia's Arctic]{.underline} and that ATS claimant states are
not respecting Moscow's interests in the Antarctic region. [This
situation increases the risk of miscalculation and tactical errors,
which could lead to unwanted escalation.]{.underline} Polar
miscalculations At the South Pole, risks of miscalculation are linked to
Russia's increased presence and assertive posture regarding other
parties to the ATS (see Chapter 5). These are longer-term prospects but
could force the Kremlin to adopt a comprehensive and combined approach
to both poles. Indeed, a similar pattern is slowly emerging between
security issues in the Arctic and Antarctic regions -- largely as a
result of increased human activity. [In the Arctic,]{.underline} the
equation is simple: [under the impact of climate change, greater human
access to,]{.underline} and presence in, [Arctic waters (whether for
commercial, civilian or military purposes) will increase the number and
frequency of accidents and incidents both at sea]{.underline} and in the
air. [This will]{.underline}, in turn, [raise the risk of
miscalculation]{.underline}. [A greater number of surface vessels,
underwater systems and aerial platforms in the European Arctic and
Pacific Arctic -- coupled with extreme weather events and the non-linear
nature of climate change -- will make day-to-day activities such as
patrols and constabulary missions harder to manage. The Arctic is also
not immune to environmental and safety risks, notably from
nuclear-powered vessels and those carrying nuclear
missiles]{.underline}.120 This is equally true for the Southern Ocean.
[The situation is made worse by the reduction in official channels of
communication with Russia since 2014 and further deterioration since
early 2022]{.underline}. [Russia's behaviour and lack of restraint
generally are also causes for concern]{.underline} -- from its lack of
transparency in dealing with serious environmental events121 to its
military activities in peacetime. The latter include dangerous
manoeuvres against Norwegian assets;122 ADIZ violations against Japan
and South Korea; GPS-jamming in northern Finland and Norway during the
NATO 'Trident Juncture' exercise in 2018;123 snap missile drills;124 and
other military activity taking place beyond the AZRF.125 These
activities particularly impact the overall security of the Barents,
Norwegian and Bering Seas (see Chapters 2--4 for discussion of existing
chokepoints). [The risk of miscalculation is compounded by Russia's need
to 'respond' to the expansion of NATO in the European
Arctic]{.underline} (Finland and Sweden potentially joining the alliance
being a case in point)126 and NATO's supposed activities directed
against the AZRF, as well as the increased US presence in the Pacific
theatre.127 For the US, NATO and their allies[, an additional risk is
that their regional military assets could be threatened by Russian
systems, and particularly by naval aviation groups and air-superiority
assets, long-range missile systems and strategic bomber
overflights]{.underline}.

[The exploitation of Arctic riches accelerated in post-Soviet Russia.
Oil and gas played the pivotal role in restoring the country's economic
fortunes in the early 2000s, underwriting domestic stability, fostering
Putin's rise as the country's undisputed leader, and returning Russia to
the world stage]{.underline} as an aspiring great power intent upon
recouping its losses in Europe and reclaiming its rightful place in the
international system. [The role of oil and gas in Russia's Arctic
ambitions was highlighted]{.underline} in 2006 [as part of the Kremlin's
agenda to establish the country as an "energy superpower" and to justify
its inclusion in the G8]{.underline}.3 [Rising temperatures would make
those riches more accessible]{.underline} and ensure the Kremlin a
steady source of revenues as well as market and geopolitical influence
in Europe and Asia. And [without any contenders to challenge these
ambitions, Russia had a shot at securing its place as a major
geopolitical presence in the Arctic. Even the high projected costs and
technological difficulties associated with exploration and recovery of
Arctic offshore resources did not appear to pose a major obstacle to the
Kremlin's ambitions.]{.underline} Projects would be open to
participation by foreign energy companies with their technology and
capital, and their participation would make them powerful stakeholders
that could influence Western governments' policy choices toward Russia.
Moreover, thanks to the warming temperatures in the Arctic, the
development of the NSR along Russia's Arctic coastline would provide the
Kremlin with an opportunity to diversify its energy policy by eventually
linking the Russian Arctic to markets in Asia, thus reducing the
country's reliance on Europe as a critical energy market and on Ukraine
as a critical conduit to that market.4 [With oil and gas accounting for
as much as 60 percent of Russia's export revenues]{.underline} and
upward of 30 percent of its federal budget, [the motive behind its
Arctic ambitions is not difficult to discern. The revenue from these
projects would]{.underline} help sustain several critical priorities:
[further consolidation of Putin's hold on political power]{.underline}
as the leader who returned Russia from the abyss and restored it to
greatness, the accumulation of funds to hedge against future economic or
political adversity, [and the rebuilding of the military]{.underline},
which had long suffered from neglect and was in need of modernization.

#### 5. Russia lacks the ability to de-escalate, and other areas spill up to the Arctic

**Boulègue, 2024 - Global Fellow at the Wilson's Center Polar
Institute** \[Mathieu, October 31, The Arctic Institute, Russia\'s
Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/\]

[A more vulnerable yet assertive Russia in the Arctic, coupled with more
NATO attention towards the region, can only mean that the risk of
miscalculation provoked by civilian and military accidents, incidents,
and tactical errors will increase. Because of the absence of clear lines
of communication and deconfliction between Russia and the Arctic 7
countries, it could lead to unintended escalation and further down the
road, to military tension if not conflict]{.underline}. [This situation
is worsened by the fact that Moscow's restraint over such events cannot
be taken for granted anymore]{.underline} -- [as exemplified by Russia's
continued low intensity warfare operations in peacetime against Arctic
nations and NATO allies]{.underline}. Finally, the absence of Russian
transparency regarding recent environmental disasters17) in the region
adds more complexity to peacefully solving potential crises. [Another
form of risk relates to horizontal escalation -- i.e. military tension
from other theaters such as the North Atlantic or the North Pacific
spilling over into the Arctic.]{.underline} In the context of the
Finnish and Swedish adhesion to NATO, the Baltic Sea represents a key
area for horizontal escalation towards the Arctic. Finally,
[miscalculations could happen in the context of Russian sharp power
activities in circumpolar governance]{.underline} -- [for
instance,]{.underline} the [contestation of the Svalbard Treaty with
Norway or exploiting recent decisions1]{.underline}8) by the UN
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) regarding
Russia and the United States. As a knee-jerk reaction, Moscow also
recently threatened to withdraw from the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS).19)

#### 6. Russia is becoming more confrontational in the Arctic - they are increasing their sub threshold reactions

**Boulègue, 2024 - Global Fellow at the Wilson's Center Polar
Institute** \[Mathieu, October 31, The Arctic Institute, Russia\'s
Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/\]

[The Kremlin is now prioritizing the completion and maintenance of
existing infrastructure]{.underline} rather than seeking to expand the
network. Moscow must also consider climate change impact and budget
constraints. As a response to the sense of vulnerability in the AZRF,
[Russia is becoming more confrontational in its approach towards
regional security and finding excuses to 'defend' itself against
perceived external threats]{.underline}. While the Kremlin is taking
stock of the consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, Russia
will likely conduct more conventional power demonstrations,
sub-threshold activities, and grey zone operations in the Arctic. While
there is little incentive for the Kremlin leadership to escalate in the
region per se, [there is also a strong willingness to continue probing
and testing the resolve of the Arctic]{.underline} 7 through a
well-established toolkit of low intensity warfare operations. [These
sub-threshold operations and grey zone activities mostly take the form
of: Brinkmanship-prone activities]{.underline}12) through offensive
peacetime maneuvers at sea and in the air, especially close to the air
defense identification zones (ADIZ) of NATO countries and NORAD,
[Regular snap military exercises]{.underline}, strategic bomber
overflights and patrol activities, and the weaponization of notices to
air missions13) (NOTAM) in the Barents Sea, across North Pole
approaches, and close to the Bering Strait and Alaska -- including with
China14), [Seabed warfare activities]{.underline}15), and notably the
disruption of critical undersea infrastructure (CUI) such as energy
pipelines and fiber optic data cables across Arctic chokepoints,
GNSS/GPS jamming and recurrent electronic warfare operations16) in
Lapland and Finnmark in the European High North -- with severe risks for
civilian and commercial assets.

#### 7. Russia is expanding militarily in the Arctic - it will deploy nuclear subs and defend the Arctic by any means necessary

**Starchark 24, expert on Russian Nuclear Policy at Carnegie Politika**

Growing Nuclear Threat"

Around the same time that Norway reported the surge in radiation levels,
[Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov]{.underline}
[accused](https://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/minister_speeches/1970336/)
[NATO of militarizing the Arctic through increasingly frequent crisis
response exercises.]{.underline} Yet Russia is guilty of the same. [Its
new foreign policy
[concepts](https://www.mid.ru/ru/detail-material-page/1860586/) and
[doctrines](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/official_documents/1688734/)
call the Arctic "a vital area for ensuring our national interests in the
global ocean," and Moscow has
[warned](https://iz.ru/1687752/2024-04-25/mid-rf-predupredil-ob-otvete-zapadu-na-voennuiu-aktivnost-v-arktike)
that it will use "any means necessary" to secure its interests
there.]{.underline} Those means include the Northern Fleet, whose ships
regularly---and
conspicuously---[traverse](https://flot.com/2024/530231/?sphrase_id=8945266&ysclid=m03o8w5tho160535187)
the Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines. [Particularly
crucial to Russia's plans is its fleet of nuclear submarines, which
has]{.underline}
[become](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Russia-Nuclear-Report-2021-FINAL.pdf)
[significantly more active in northern waters in the past
decade.]{.underline} [The fleet consists of twelve strategic nuclear
submarines carrying up to 192 nuclear-capable ballistic missiles,
twenty-four nuclear submarines armed with cruise missiles, and ten
special-purpose nuclear submarines, with another twelve nuclear
submarines under construction or nearly ready for commission. The Arctic
is also a testing ground for new nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed
weapons]{.underline}---from the Burevestnik cruise missile to the
Poseidon torpedo---[contributing to both regional tensions and the risk
of [radiation
accidents](https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nuclear-hazards-in-Arctic-policy-brief_updated.pdf).]{.underline}
[That risk is growing, not only because of Russia's military activities,
but also because of its increasing economic activity in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Rosatom, the state nuclear company, operates the
eight-ship nuclear icebreaker fleet that is key to the Northern Sea
Route, along which 36 million tons of cargo were
[transported](https://www.rosatom.ru/en/press-centre/news/historical-record-of-the-northern-sea-route-the-cargo-carriage-volume-in-2023-exceeded-36-254-mln-to/)
in 2023, up from 4 million in 2014. That number is
[expected](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/news/2023/04/07/969969-perevozki-po-sevmorputi)
to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker fleet is
to expand by seven more vessels.

#### 8. Russia is motivated to conquer the Arctic - from the Czars through Putin, Russia has pushed Arctic expansion

**Caldon, 2023 - professor of National Security at the Air Force
University** \[Josh, April 13, Center for International Maritime
Security, Why the US is Losing The Race for the Arctic and What to Do
About It,
https://cimsec.org/why-the-us-is-losing-the-race-for-the-arctic-and-what-to-do-about-it/\]

This is not the case for Russia or China. [Russia suffers
from]{.underline} what Hill and Gaddy call [the Siberian Curse. Its
geography is not as economically favorable as America's, which has
forced it to turn towards the Arctic to improve its economic
circumstances]{.underline}. However, it has also traditionally operated
a state-controlled economy that uses slave labor and nationally owned
corporations to mask the economic, environmental and demographic costs
of operating in the Arctic. Beginning with the czars, and accelerating
under Russia's Soviet dictators, [Russia forcibly sent millions of
people to develop and "conquer the Arctic." This legacy continues today
as Putin pushes and subsidizes Russia's economic ministries and
state-controlled corporations to extract more resources from the Arctic
and to expand the infrastructure of the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}
(with the numerous powerful icebreakers needed to navigate this
waterway) to transport these resources to distant markets. Unlike
American corporations, Russia's economic pursuits in the Arctic are not
concerned with environmental or indigenous considerations either.
Furthermore, [Russia's extreme sacrifices in the Arctic have made
developing and controlling it symbolic for its people and
leadership]{.underline}. As such, [Russia has much more to defend
materially and ideationally in the Arctic than the US does]{.underline}.
Even with these factors pushing Russia to conquer the Arctic, Russia's
regional ambitions have been challenged by fiscal, demographic, and
environmental hurdles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has forced it
to curtail its ambitious Arctic railway and icebreaker projects and to
mobilize and sacrifice a significant proportion of its Arctic troops for
combat in Ukraine. Additionally, many of its Arctic cities have rapidly
de-populated, and the Arctic melt has paradoxically threatened its
existing Arctic infrastructure.

### \--Extend - Sea Lanes

#### Russian reactions to Western pressure on sea lanes of communication are increasing the risk of miscalculation

**Boulègue, 2024 - Global Fellow at the Wilson's Center Polar
Institute** \[Mathieu, October 31, The Arctic Institute, Russia\'s
Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/\]

[Russia's imperative to remove tension from the Arctic is consequently
adding pressure on critical regional chokepoints -- notably in the
European High North with the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK)
gap,]{.underline} [the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) gap, and the 'Bear
gap' (between the Svalbard archipelago, Bear Island, and mainland
Norway) as well as in the Pacific Arctic across the Bering
Strait.]{.underline} In the High North[, Russian actions are heightening
tension across the North Atlantic sea lines of
communication]{.underline} and on the Nordic-Baltic continuum regarding
NATO reinforcements. As the Atlantic Alliance is taking stock of the
Finnish and Sweden accession, more policy attention will be required to
determine the exact role and place of NATO in a circumpolar environment.
Meanwhile, the Kremlin is currently taking stock of how Finland and
Sweden will approach their NATO membership, notably the deployment of
troops and military capabilities. The Alliance recently agreed to the
creation of a Multi Corps Land Component Command25) (MCLCC) as well as
Forward Land Forces (FLF) in Finland, a multinational battle group
initially composed of Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish troops. [These
initiatives will undeniably strengthen the land component of High North
defense. Yet it is something Moscow will follow closely and ultimately
feel forced to respond to, with the risk of miscalculation and military
escalation looming.]{.underline}

### \--Extend - Military Bases

#### Russia is increasing its security apparatus in the Arctic which will increase the risk of miscalculation

**Adler, 2025- European Editor** (Katya, May 23, BBC. "Tensions Rise as
Superpowers Scrap for a Piece of the Arctic"
<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwqn7z02plo>)

I\'m able to see how [Norway monitors this threat]{.underline}, after we
get high security clearance to enter the country\'s Cold War-era joint
military command. It\'s deep inside a quartz mountain in Bodø, within
the Arctic Circle. We find a labyrinth of tunnels and surveillance rooms
where Norway gathers real-time intelligence from land, air and sea,
focused on suspicious-looking vessels in and near its Arctic waters.
Everything is shared in real-time with Nato allies. [Crucially, any
Russian vessel wanting to enter Europe has to pass through Norwegian
waters first. Agents]{.underline} in the mountain HQ [are on the lookout
for signs of espionage and sabotage around what officials call
underwater \"critical infrastructure\" as part of the Kremlin\'s hybrid
warfare against the West. Targets include undersea communications
cables - connecting continents and permitting trillions of dollars\'
worth of financial transactions a day - and also oil and gas
pipelines.]{.underline} Norway is a major supplier of natural gas to
Europe, including the UK, especially since sanctions were imposed on
Russian exports following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [Moscow
has been modernising its military capabilities in the Arctic. It has a
serious fleet of spy and nuclear submarines. If they pass undetected,
they could potentially target missiles at capitals across Europe and
also threaten the US.]{.underline} US President Donald Trump has told
Europe it must do more for its own defence, but inside the Arctic, there
is a \"great overlap of interests\", says the chief of the Norwegian
joint headquarters Vice Adm Rune Andersen. \"This is also about US
homeland defence... The Russian concentration of nuclear weapons, the
capabilities that Russia is deploying are not only aimed at Europe, but
also at the US,\" he says. [Vice Adm Andersen doesn\'t believe any party
is courting open conflict in the Arctic but with global tensions rising
elsewhere, such as over Ukraine, the potential for spillover in the
Arctic is there.]{.underline}

 

### \--Extend - More Boats cause Miscalculation

#### Russia is expanding its military in the Arctic - joint exercises and air defence forces

Buildup in the Arctic: Political Rhetoric vs. Reality"
https://broadenimpact.com/2015/10/russias-military-buildup-in-the-arctic-political-rhetoric-vs-reality/\]

[Russia is also re-opening airfields and radar sites in the Arctic to
restore the air defense forces demolished after the end of the Cold
War.]{.underline} Groupings of air defense forces have already been
formed in Russia's island territories in the Arctic, including the
Novaya Zemlya, the New Siberian Islands, and Wrangel Island, as well as
at Cape Schmidt. In December 2014, [Joint Strategic Command North was
established to coordinate the different military branches located in the
Arctic. Starting in 2012, Russia has increased its number of military
exercises in the region. The largest Arctic exercises took place in
March 2015,]{.underline} involving 38,000 soldiers, 3,360 vehicles, 41
naval vessels, 15 submarines, and 110 aircraft. They started as snap
exercises aimed at inspecting combat readiness of the Northern Fleet,
but later expanded to include units from four other Russian military
districts. Among the most recent exercises is one on Taimyr Peninsula in
August 2015 involving more than 1,000 military personnel and 12
aircraft. [The exercises focused on training to defend an important
industrial object and respond to a potential terrorist attack as well as
man-made and technological emergency situations. The exercise scenarios
show that the military forces in the Arctic focus on a variety of
tasks]{.underline} ranging from traditional scenarios of large-scale
military conflict to relatively new ones related to shipping security
and the defense of expansive resource extraction projects.

### \--Extend - Access to Oil

#### Russia has economic interests in the Arctic - oil and gas, rare earth metals, and fish.

[Russia's]{.underline} [sparsely populated]{.underline} [Arctic

roughly]{.underline} [20 percent]{.underline} [of]{.underline}

About [one-third of all fish]{.underline} [harvested in
Russia]{.underline} [comes from Arctic waters]{.underline}, making it
[a]{.underline} [key]{.underline} [food source.]{.underline} The Russian
[government hopes to increase that share by 2030]{.underline}, as
warming ocean water pushes fish stocks northward.12 [Tapping these
resources is Russia's primary economic interest]{.underline}, but [doing
so]{.underline} [will require]{.underline} [developing costly and
complicated road, rail, aviation, and maritime]{.underline}
[transportation infrastructure]{.underline} [to connect the
Arctic]{.underline} [to other parts of the country and
beyond]{.underline}. It will also [require expanding icebreaking
capabilities and developing ports, weather stations, and emergency
response facilities]{.underline}. Building this infrastructure is
Moscow's second economic priority in the region. Finally, [Russia
aspires to transform]{.underline} [its northern coast into]{.underline}
[the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, a navigable maritime corridor
through Arctic waters. Currently [passable without icebreaker
escort]{.underline} only in the summer months, the corridor is [used
mainly by Russian vessels to transport Arctic resources to markets in
Asia]{.underline}. Russia's 2020 Arctic strategy, however, envisions
transforming it into a competitive Asia-Europe maritime corridor by
2035.13

#### Russia has increased its militarization of the Arctic - it changed how it portrayed the Arctic to emphasize competition for fossil fuels over cooperation

**Klimenko 2019, Researcher, Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute** \[Ekaterina, 8/5/2019, Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, NARRATIVES IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA OF CONFLICT AND
COOPERATION IN THE ARCTIC,
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/sipriinsight1908.pdf\]

[Russia's official narrative on the Arctic has changed several times
over the past decade and a half]{.underline}. In the first half of the
2000s, its Arctic policy followed the foreign policy principles of
Vladimir Putin's first two terms as president, particularly the ideas of
reviving Russia as a great power, restoring its military might and
maintaining its status as an energy superpower.13 This was reflected in
Russia's first Arctic strategy in 2001.14 Since then, the Arctic has
remained one of Russia's top priorities. [The region's importance to
Russia's energy sector is increasing and the Arctic is seen as the major
source of hydrocarbons for the next 20--50 years.]{.underline}15 Another
priority is development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which is
crucial for transporting Arctic resources to an expanding market,
especially as climate change and the melting permafrost make it more
difficult to rely on terrestrial infrastructure to transport resources
to and from remote areas[. For historical and geographical reasons, the
Arctic and the Kola Peninsula, in particular, are home to a large
proportion of Russia's sea-based nuclear deterrence forces. This makes
the Arctic vital from a defence perspective.16 Moreover, it is important
to Russia's national identity and its image as a great power.17 The
Arctic is a region where Russia can demonstrate its military power to
domestic and international audiences. In 2008, the Russian narrative on
the Arctic began to shift noticeably. While Russia did not abandon its
plans for military modernization in the region, it did change the
narrative and start to focus on building cooperation. Russia's 2008
Arctic policy defines the Arctic as a 'zone of peace and cooperation'.18
Russia has repeatedly underlined that there are 'no threats in the
region that would require a military solution'.19 It has also engaged
with the other Arctic states to develop the rules of the game in the
region in order to guarantee the sovereignty of the Arctic states,
determine best practice for resolving territorial disputes and ensure
that all relevant rights in the Arctic are divided between the Arctic
states, with only limited involvement from non Arctic
states.]{.underline} Russia has thus been supportive of the 1982 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and was a signatory of
the Ilulissat Declaration and the Nuuk Declaration.20 Furthermore, in
2010 Russia signed a bilateral treaty with Norway on delimitation of the
maritime border between the two countries in the Barents Sea, thereby
resolving a 40-year territorial dispute.21 On other claims, Russia
submitted a revised filing to the Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf in 2015. The area covered extends to the North Pole,
where it overlaps with Danish and Canadian claims.22 In 2012, at the
start of Putin's third presidential term, relations between Russia and
the West started to deteriorate and reached a low point as a result of
the crisis in Ukraine. [This deterioration was also reflected in the
Arctic, where Russia reverted to more assertive rhetoric that
highlighted the various emerging threats in the region.23 Among these
threats was the 'militarization of the region'.24 Military documents,
such as the 2015 National Security Strategy, the 2015 Maritime Strategy
and the 2014 Military Doctrine, paid increased attention to the Arctic
region. However, a cooperation narrative persisted alongside this
increased focus on military security, whereby the Russian Foreign Policy
Concept of 2016 underlined Russian support for international cooperation
in the region.25]{.underline}

### \--Extend - History

#### Historically, the Arctic has been described in terms of environmental cooperation. Recently, the Arctic has been described militarily, as a launching pad for Russian attacks on Ukraine

**Szczerbowicz, 2025 - prof of Social Sciences at The Institute of
International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**
\[Wojciech, May 24, Wschodnioznawstwo (Eastern Studies) "Constructing
reality through language. Russia in the Western Arctic discourse"

The Arctic region's political landscape before February 2022 was shaped
by a complex interplay of postcolonial history, environmental
cooperation, and the evolving dynamics between the West and Russia.
[During the Cold War, the Arctic was a strategic frontier marked by
military presence and political tension between the United States and
the Soviet Union. However, with the Cold War's conclusion, new
opportunities for cooperation emerged,]{.underline} particularly in
environmental protection. This shift was exemplified by the 1973
Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, which marked the beginning
of international efforts to safeguard the Arctic's fragile ecosystem. In
the post--Cold War era, the establishment of the Arctic Council in 1996
represented a pivotal development in regional governance. Although not a
formal international organisation, [the Arctic Council provided a forum
for dialogue among Arctic states, including Russia.]{.underline} Its
focus on issues such as environmental protection aligned with the
broader international context, which favoured cooperation. However, the
Arctic Council deliberately excluded discussions on hard security,
leaving significant areas of political tension unresolved. Consequently,
cooperation between the West and Russia remained complex and often
contentious. For example, the publication of the Arctic Climate Impact
Assessment and Russia's 2007 symbolic planting of a flag on the North
Pole seabed attracted significant media attention, resulting in what has
been described as a 'media frenzy'. These events underscored the
region's growing strategic importance, driven by environmental reports
and political developments. The enduring complexities in West--Russia
relations set the stage for the challenges that would emerge in the
following years. [The annexation of Crimea in 2014 tested the concept of
Arctic exceptionalism -- the belief that the Arctic could remain
insulated from broader political conflicts. Despite heightened tensions,
little initially changed in the Arctic cooperation, with the Arctic
Council continuing its work.]{.underline} However, Russia's full--scale
invasion of Ukraine in 2022 marked a true critical juncture for regional
international relations. Increased militarisation became evident, with
Western states expressing concerns about Russia's potential revisionism
and expansionist aims, especially as attacks on Ukraine have been
partially launched from the Arctic, such as bombers from Olenya air
base. The Arctic Council paused its activities involving Russia, and the
Barents Euro--Arctic Council ceased functioning in its prior format,
signalling a breakdown in regional cooperation. Sweden and Finland's
decision to join NATO further altered the security dynamics of the
Arctic, reflecting an intensified response to perceived threats from its
eastern neighbour. Sanctions imposed on Russia also had a significant
impact on its Arctic economic projects, constraining investment and
technological support. [In response, Russia pivoted towards increased
cooperation with non--Arctic states, notably China, and possibly other
BRICS members, seeking alternative partners for Arctic
development]{.underline}. This shift underscores the changing landscape
of the Arctic international relations amid escalating political
tensions.

### Chinese Threat Increasing

#### China is developing satellite surveillance technology in the Arctic

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The

Navigation and Satellite Technology [Research conducted by
PLA]{.underline}, both unilaterally and in cooperation with civilian
stakeholders[, indicates that Arctic navigation and satellite
surveillance technology has been identified as a priority by China's
military establishment]{.underline}. [These knowledge and
capacity-building efforts have been identified as a security threat in
the Arctic by the US in its latest Arctic policy]{.underline}.37) In
2015, researchers from PLA and the China Ship Development and Design
Center published an article on maneuverability of ships in the
region38). In 2016, The PLA University of Science and Technology
completed research on climate change and weather in the Arctic.39)
Navigation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but both Arctic
climate change and weather conditions are key elements of navigational
possibilities in the region. A joint paper by researchers from the PLA
and the National Ocean Satellite Application Center (NSOAS)40) in 2015
about ice levels, melting and the impact on ship navigation in the
Arctic concluded that global warming is decreasing ice levels to such an
extent that navigating Arctic waterways will become possible as global
temperatures rise (Shili, et al., 2015). In 2014, the PLA undertook a
joint research effort with NSOAS and Shanghai Ocean University that
confirmed that data provided by the HY-2 satellite, developed by NSOAS
in 2011, could be used for "operational sea services" in the Arctic.41)
[These research undertakings provide early signs of PLA interest in
Arctic ship navigation and the usage of military-civilian cooperation on
building up Chinese naval capacities in the Arctic. Satellite data has,
indeed, been identified as having military uses in the Arctic,
underscored by the recent warnings from The Swedish Defense Research
Agency,]{.underline} an affiliate of the Swedish Army and Ministry of
Defense, [that Chinese investments in]{.underline}, and cooperation on,
Swedish [satellite technology could have military uses in the
Arctic]{.underline}.42) The PLA has reportedly been building up its
Arctic navigational capabilities since these research projects were
undertaken.43)

As soon as Magnus Mæland became mayor of a small town on Norway\'s
northern tip in late 2023, three delegations from [China came knocking
on his door. \"It\'s because they want to be a polar
superpower,\"]{.underline} he tells me. [China]{.underline} might not
instinctively spring to mind when you think about the Arctic - but
[it\'s determined to be a big Arctic player. It\'s been]{.underline}
vying to buy real estate, [get involved in infrastructure projects and
hopes to establish a permanent regional presence. China already
describes itself as a \"near-Arctic state]{.underline}\", even though
its northernmost regional capital Harbin is on roughly the same latitude
as Venice, Italy. [But the Arctic is fast becoming one of the most
hotly-contested parts of the world. Beijing faces stiff competition from
Russia, Europe, India and the US. The race for the Arctic is
on.]{.underline}

#### China is expanding its access to Arctic resources, which challenges US influence

[Increased access to energy and mineral resources extraction due to ice
melt, holds significant capacity for growth]{.underline}.55) [The area
is home to 22 percent of the world's resources, which includes up to 25
percent of unexplored oil and gas reserves]{.underline}. Despite having
no Arctic land, [PRC refers to itself as a "near Arctic state,"
investing heavily in the region]{.underline}. In 2012, [PRC invested
\$12 billion in the Russian Yamal LNG project after US sanctions left
Russia short on funds.]{.underline}56) Furthermore, [in 2018, PRC signed
an agreement to invest in Alaskan natural gas export
facility]{.underline},57) and in 2019, [Chinese companies purchased 10

relations]{.underline}, making it a key consideration for American
strategic planning.

#### China is adopting a securitized approach to protecting their commercial interests in the Arctic - Chinese academic and international sources prove

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

This article finds that the reality is a middle ground between how China
describes its own Arctic strategy and the most critical Western
analyses. [There is currently little available evidence to suggest that
China will pursue a military course in the Arctic similar to, or
aligning with, Russia. Commercial development appears to be China's main
goal]{.underline}, [but it is evident that China is building its
capacity to enforce its perceived rights and protect its interests
through an increasingly security-focused Arctic strategy that is backed
up by the military. This article examines publicly available data and
documents from international organizations; Chinese bureaucracy,
organizations and academic journals]{.underline}; media; various
national governments of Arctic Countries; and Chinese academic output on
Arctic issues [to analyze China's evolving approach on the
Arctic]{.underline}. The article is divided into three parts. First, it
explains China's evolving view of the Arctic, [shifting from a focus on
research to considering its presence in the region as a commercial,
diplomatic and security imperative.]{.underline} Second, the article
[provides an in-depth analysis of Chinese official planning
documents]{.underline} and research by key Chinese security stakeholders
to [illuminate the increasing security focus in China's Arctic
strategy.]{.underline} Third, it discusses interpretations of legal
frameworks in the Arctic and its impact on China's role in the region.
[China will have to balance its own stated adherence to mainstream
interpretations of international law in the Arctic with its revisionist
interpretations of the same legal framework in its regional
waters.]{.underline}

#### China sees scientific progress and the Arctic Council as avenues for power - it justifies their securitization of the Arctic

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

[China's increasing focus on commercial opportunities in the Arctic15)
has grown in tandem with its efforts to contribute to the shaping of
norms and rules in the region through multilateral
forums]{.underline}.16) As indicated in its official Arctic policy,
China states that it wants to play, "a constructive part in the making,
interpretation, application and development of international rules
regarding the Arctic".17) While China has contributed to other
multilateral forums, [the Arctic Council is the principal outlet for
these efforts, where countries' scientific and academic capacities in
the Arctic play an important part]{.underline}. [Scientific output and
collaborations are what gives countries a seat at the table in Arctic
Council working groups.18) China's presence in the Arctic Council
started in 2006]{.underline}, and discussions about Chinese ascension to
Arctic Council permanent observer status coincided with a significant
increase in Chinese activity in the council.19) In China's 2016 and 2018
Arctic Council observer reports it stated that it took part in most
working groups20)21) and that it took part in every Arctic Council
meeting possible.22) [China's efforts to lead in Arctic science is
reflected in a steady increase of publications since 2006. According to
a 2016 pilot study, China was "by far the nation with the highest
relative growth (260 per-cent increase)"]{.underline} since then,
ranking 7th in terms of Arctic scientific publications.23) Statistics
from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database indicates that
this trend has continued since then (see Figure 1.). [A scientific
presence in the Arctic not only provides China with legitimate access to
the region's waters, but also the technical capabilities to map, survey
and monitor the region.26) These research activities therefore have the
potential to support both Chinese commercial and military activities in
the Arctic]{.underline}. For example, the marine research voyage of the
Chinese icebreaker, 'Xue Long', westward through the Arctic in 2017,
provided the Chinese with valuable information on the viability of
future trade through the region.27) Similarly, [the Annual U.S.
Department of Defense report to Congress regarding China argues that:
"Civilian research could support a strengthened Chinese military
presence in the Arctic Ocean,]{.underline} which could include deploying
submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks".28)
[China's increasing civilian focus on mapping, surveying, and navigation
in the Arctic Council could be seen in the same context]{.underline}.

### Russia-China Threat Increasing

#### Sino-Russian Arctic cooperation is deepening - they are focusing on security for shipping lanes

**Dieckmann, 2025 -- Independent China policy analyst** \[Oliver, May
24, The Diplomat, "From Rhetoric to Reality: China-Russia Cooperation in
the Arctic Accelerates"
https://thediplomat.com/2025/05/from-rhetoric-to-reality-china-russia-cooperation-in-the-arctic-accelerates/\]

[When China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin meet, one theme
surfaces with clockwork regularity: Arctic collaboration.]{.underline}
In every joint statement issued during their state visits since February
2022, the Arctic is framed as a shared strategic priority -- from the
"limitless friendship" declaration in February 2022 to the follow-up
encounters in March 2023, May 2024, and the summit with Xi Jinping in
Moscow for the 80th anniversary of the Victory Day in 2025. [Similar
language has echoed through every round of annual intergovernmental
consultations since 2018, with Arctic cooperation reaffirmed year after
year. What began as political signaling is now becoming reality --
through joint drills in the Arctic Ocean and growing
military-technological cooperation, new bilateral Arctic governance
formats, and intensified use of Arctic shipping lanes on the Northern
Sea Route.]{.underline} China and Russia's Arctic engagement is set to
accelerate. Institutional Arctic Alignment Moscow's attitude toward
Beijing's polar ambitions has flipped. [When China was granted observer
status in the Arctic Council in 2013, Russia insisted on language
safeguarding state sovereignty]{.underline} -- a sign of unease. But
[Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then the full-scale invasion
of Ukraine in 2022 altered geopolitical dynamics in the
Arctic]{.underline}. While Russia held the rotating chairmanship of the
Arctic Council from 2021 to 2023, the other seven member states
suspended their participation in meetings on Russian territory. Amid
this boycott, [China's Arctic envoy Gao Feng publicly sided with Moscow,
warning that Beijing could not recognize an Arctic Council composed
solely of the Arctic Seven]{.underline}, effectively rejecting the
isolation of Russia. Since then, a more structured form of cooperation
has begun to take shape. In November 2024, the inaugural session of the
[Sino-Russian Arctic Waterway Subcommittee convened in St. Petersburg,
under the broader framework of the regular China-Russia prime
ministerial consultations]{.underline}. Far from a ceremonial meeting,
[the subcommittee is a standing institution, divided into three working
groups that focus on shipping development, navigational safety, and
polar shipbuilding and technology]{.underline}.

#### Russia and China are cooperating to securitize the Arctic - they are cooperating on submarines and joint exercises

**Dieckmann, 2025 -- Independent China policy analyst** \[Oliver, May
24, The Diplomat, "From Rhetoric to Reality: China-Russia Cooperation in
the Arctic Accelerates"
https://thediplomat.com/2025/05/from-rhetoric-to-reality-china-russia-cooperation-in-the-arctic-accelerates/\]

Separately, [the readout of a 2021 intergovernmental consultation
mentioned a Sino-Russian cooperation roadmap for Russia's Arctic
regions]{.underline} and an April 2023 law enforcement agreement brought
the FSB (Russia's Federal Security Service) and the China Coast Guard
into closer contact. While the concrete outcomes of these accords remain
opaque, [they indicate a steady institutional layering that has shifted
the partnership from rhetoric to emerging operational coordination --
including in the security domain.]{.underline} Joint Arctic Drills [From
2022 to 2024, China and Russia held 27 joint military exercises, among
them 16 joint naval exercises, including a record seven in 2024
alone]{.underline}. Some of these drills included maneuvers in Arctic
waters, such as [Pacific Patrol 2024 and Ocean 2024]{.underline}. [The
latter patrol followed shortly after bombers from both militaries flew
for the first time together near Alaska]{.underline}. All of those
maneuvers signal China and Russia's expanding military coordination in
Arctic-adjacent regions. According to Russian Admiral Roman Tolok, the
Pacific Patrol exercises will become an annual event. While not publicly
framed as Arctic-focused, it is reasonable to expect that future
iterations may rotate even more frequently across different Arctic
maritime zones. As Alexander Perendzhiev, an associate professor at the
Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, highlighted, these drills
underline Russia's determination -- alongside China -- to defend the
Northern Sea Route with its military. These developments reflect a
broader, long-standing trajectory of military cooperation. According to
data compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, [China and Russia have conducted over 110 joint military
exercises since 2003, with activity accelerating significantly after
2022]{.underline}. This intensification of operational coordination has
gone hand-in-hand with deeper military-technical ties. The Sino-Russian
Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation (MTC),
created in 1992 and traditionally co-chaired by the Russian defense
minister and a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission
(CMC), has long served as the main platform for arms sales and
technology transfers. [In 2013, both states signed an agreement to
co-produce four Lada-class attack submarines -- two built in Russia, two
in China -- which demonstrated a willingness to share sensitive naval
technology.]{.underline} Many of the concrete deliverables remain
secret. As Russian analyst Alexander Gabuev noted, [Moscow and Beijing
ceased publicly disclosing their military contracts after the U.S.
Congress passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions
Act (CAATSA) in 2017.]{.underline}

#### Russia and China are increasing security cooperation to protect new transportation routes.

**Dieckmann, 2025 -- Independent China policy analyst** \[Oliver, May
24, The Diplomat, "From Rhetoric to Reality: China-Russia Cooperation in
the Arctic Accelerates"
https://thediplomat.com/2025/05/from-rhetoric-to-reality-china-russia-cooperation-in-the-arctic-accelerates/\]

Arctic Trade Corridors [New transport corridors also show how far the
Sino-Russian Arctic cooperation has progressed. In summer 2023, the
Chinese logistics company NewNew Shipping Line opened a seasonal,
maritime-only Northern Sea Route (NSR) container service linking
Shanghai with St. Petersburg,]{.underline} Kaliningrad, and Arkhangelsk.
In 2024, the company also established "Arctic Express No. 1," a
transport corridor that ships from Shanghai and Ningbo to Arkhangelsk,
where cargo transfers to rail for the final leg to Moscow. [These routes
significantly reduce transit times between China and
Europe.]{.underline} For example, the shipping distance from Shanghai to
Hamburg drops from approximately 18,709 km via the Suez Canal to 14,440
km via the Arctic -- an estimated 23 percent reduction. Compared to the
Cape of Good Hope route (26,022 km), the distance is shortened by
roughly 45 percent. However, transit volumes on the NSR remain far below
official projections. In 2024, total cargo volume reached 37.9 million
tonnes, up by just 1.6 million tonnes from 2023. This was less than half
of Putin's long-standing target of 80 million tonnes by 2024, as
outlined in multiple strategic planning documents. Nevertheless, one key
metric did surge: Rosatom counted 92 full NSR transits, which together
carried over 3 million tonnes of cargo -- a nearly 50 percent increase
from the previous year, despite a shortened navigation season caused by
unusually heavy sea ice. This sea ice, which often renders the RSE
impassable, remains a major obstacle. However, both countries are
investing significant effort and resources to overcome this challenge.
[Russia is expanding its fleet of Project 22,220 icebreakers. Most
recently, it launched the Yakutiya and the Chukotka, with the Leningrad
and the Stalingrad under construction. Meanwhile, China is also
preparing to construct a new generation of icebreakers, following the
Xuelong 2, to supplement its growing Arctic ambitions.]{.underline}
These efforts, in combination with the melting ice will facilitate
shipping on the Northern Sea Route in the future. Accelerated Expansion
Taken together, [recent developments in the military, logistical,
diplomatic, and intergovernmental realms suggest that the prerequisites
for a rapid expansion of China-Russia Arctic cooperation are already in
pla]{.underline}ce. If sea ice decline continues on its current
trajectory, the Northern Sea Route could by 2040 carry a reliable,
year-round flow of goods, delivering sizable cargo volume.

#### China and Russia are expanding in the Arctic to extend their reach for resources

Arctic Region"

[The Arctic strategic environment is changing profoundly, and the United
States must pay greater attention and dedicate more resources to this
crucial area]{.underline}, said Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for Arctic and Global Resilience. Ferguson
addressed the increased attention that the People\'s Republic of China
has in the Arctic. She spoke at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies today. Paratroopers descend onto an Alaskan drop
zone. China is, by no means, an Arctic nation. But [Chinese leaders see
the region as a new crossroads of the world, a new source of raw
materials and new avenues for manifesting its growing
power]{.underline}. [China is working closely with Russia in its attempt
to be seen as an Arctic power]{.underline}, Ferguson said. [Even with
Russia\'s unjust war on Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin is investing
heavily on military and economic strategies in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[\"We\'re seeing Russia continue to have immense focus on the Arctic
region, and it\'s part of their ... security calculus]{.underline},
vis-a-vis the U.S. and NATO,\" Ferguson said. \"Despite the attrition in
Ukraine, we still see them \... heavily focused on the region.\"

[The U.S. and partner NATO naval forces are prepared to confidently
engage in Arctic conflict and win]{.underline}. [That confidence should
be anchored in joint exercises grounded in Corbettian theory, and in
fostering subsurface cold-water operations; amphibious cold-weather
operations; and expertly trained warfighters. Leveraging these
capabilities does not diminish the shared aspiration for cooperation
among all Arctic states. While Russia remains the leading Arctic
stakeholder, its military posture in the region has
weakened]{.underline}. [Consequently, China's interest in Arctic
investments has waned. In response to the shift in dynamics, the United
States and its NATO allies are standing by to thaw the Arctic naval
theater.]{.underline}

# Security Kritik

### 1NC - Security Kritik

#### Hawkish rhetoric about "Arctic conflicts" will undermine cooperation and inflame tensions

**Dingman, 2014 - Associate Fellow at the World Policy Institute**
\[Erica, Jan 17, World Policy Institute, "Arctic Rhetoric"
https://jsis.washington.edu/aic/2014/01/17/arctic-rhetoric/\]

[Despite ongoing cooperation between Arctic nations]{.underline} --
Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia,
and the United States-- [mainstream rhetoric often implies Arctic
stakeholders are teetering on the brink of conflict]{.underline}. To a
great extent, [this sentiment is reflected in mass media and political
banter, inflaming the passions of audiences]{.underline}. This is true,
not only in the U.S. but also elsewhere, evidenced in the mass media
reporting of other Arctic nations and beyond. [Consider]{.underline},
for instance, [the impact of headlines pronouncing a "New Cold War" or a
"Rush for Riches," headlines not uncommon in U.S. media.]{.underline}
Some reactions may be visceral-- [insidiously implanting notions of
fear, lust, or chaos into the very core of society]{.underline}.
Similarly, political banter suggesting belligerent rivalries reminiscent
of bygone years may well influence public opinion to the detriment of
strengthened Arctic relations. A case in point occurred in December 2013
when Canada submitted its claim to the United Nations Commission on the
Limits of the Continental Shelf (UNCLOS), verbally asserting Canada's
bond to the North Pole. However, the Canadian government submitted only
"preliminary information" on its Arctic, excluding the crucial
scientific evidence that would substantiate such a pronouncement. The
rules and laws for determining validity of a claimant's submission are
orderly and well defined. Under UNCLOS, all coastal states have rights
to the waters and seabed beyond the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic
zone, including resources such as oil, gas, and fish, if they can
demonstrate that their continental shelf extends beyond this point.
Based on an underwater mass, the Lomonosov Ridge, both Russia's and
Denmark's (via Greenland) submitted claims to UNCLOS include scientific
evidence that conceivably links each nation to the North Pole. It is
expected that Canada's next submission will be similar. In Canada,
however, this omission began a waterfall of political debate played out
in mass media both in Canada and elsewhere. On December 9, 2013, the day
Parliament released the data to UNCLOS, Canada's Foreign Minister John
Baird, accompanied by the Environmental Minister and Arctic Council
Chair Leona Aglukkaq, stood in the foyer of the House of Commons. He
assured the public that additional scientific data submitted to UNCLOS
would show that "the full extent of the continental shelf in the Arctic
includes Canada's claim to the North Pole." The following day,
conservative MP Paul [Calandra accused the Liberal opposition of
abandoning Santa Claus, suggesting that Santa's workshop at the North
Pole will fall into the hands of foreign interests. "All of a sudden the
Liberals are suggesting that Santa Claus is no longer Canadian and that
they would abandon the North Pole and abandon Santa Claus,"]{.underline}
said Calandra. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau replied he would defer
questions of North Pole claims to "scientists and oceanographers." On
the heels of this Canadian banter, President Putin's response was
indirect but nevertheless determined to publically defend Russia's
Arctic presence. At a televised meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in
Moscow on December 10, Putin asserted: "I would like you to devote
special attention to deploying infrastructure and military units in the
Arctic." Recent events in December 2013 suggest the Arctic will be swept
up in a vortex of militarization and territorial disputes, in a rush for
Arctic riches and shipping opportunities. [This hawkish posturing,
however, is not representative of 21st century Arctic relations, and
could, in fact, contribute to a decline in ongoing regional cooperation,
should it create an atmosphere of mistrust]{.underline}. Indeed, the
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) 2013 Arctic Strategy makes a compelling
argument: ["Political rhetoric and press reporting about boundary
disputes and competition for resources may inflame regional
tension."]{.underline} Further, the policy report states, "[Efforts to
manage disagreements diplomatically may be hindered if the public
narrative becomes one of rivalry and conflict."]{.underline} In what
could be seen as a highly unusual policy statement, [the DoD takes a
clear position on the adverse effects of bellicose or misinformed
communication to redirect Arctic discourse toward a more accurate
appraisal of the persistent multinational commitment to
cooperation.]{.underline}

#### Their rhetoric over-securitizes the Arctic, making militarized conflict inevitable and preventing cooperation over non-military existential threats. 

**Gricius, 2021 - Fellow at the North American & Arctic Defense and
Security Network** (Gabriella, "The Arctic's Securitization,"
https://inkstickmedia.com/the-arctics-securitization/, dml)

Whether you read US Army and Coastal Guard Strategies from other Arctic
states or the front page of the New York Times, [the Arctic is becoming
nearly synonymous with fears]{.underline} about Russia and China.
Military [strategists and journalists]{.underline} alike [write about
Russian militarization as well as unwelcome Chinese
influence]{.underline} in the High North. [While there are certainly
geopolitical realities to take into consideration [when thinking about
Arctic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in [focusing too heavily on
questions of]{.mark}]{.underline} ["[hard]{.underline}"
[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, [policymakers are obscuring other
transnational issues]{.underline}, [such as climate change and cyber
security]{.underline}, [where cooperation is not only desired but also
necessary]{.underline}. In other words, [[discussing interstate
competition too much leads the Arctic on a trajectory toward becoming a
securitized region]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Yet]{.underline}, [it doesn't
have to be this way]{.underline}. [This trend can]{.underline} --- [and
should]{.underline} --- [be reversed to mitigate possible
consequences]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline}: [[Focusing on how
cooperation can be used to solve key issues in the Arctic rather than
thinking solely about military buildup]{.underline}; [changing the
framing of the Arctic in official
policie]{.underline}]{.mark}[s]{.underline}, [speeches]{.underline},
[and critical international organizations]{.underline}, such as the
Arctic Council, [and finding low-stakes issues to encourage
relationship-building]{.underline} among actors in the Arctic. So, can
the Arctic be spared from securitization? EARLY SYMPTOMS OF
SECURITIZATION [[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} is the process of
something becoming a security threat or a security issue. It [[happens
when something]{.underline}]{.mark} --- such as immigration --- [[is
labeled as]{.mark} dangerous]{.underline}, [threatening]{.underline},
[and as [an existential crisis]{.mark} by someone]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} then [that framing is accepted by an
audience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, securitization implies that
security issues are not just out there. Instead, [[by creating security
threats in the way we speak]{.underline}, [we create security
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the Arctic might seem like a
peripheral region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to
rise in importance. [[Concerns about China]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline}, [and resource competition are causing real changes
to occur in]{.underline}]{.mark} [how states treat [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has
announced the establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be
housed within the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique
challenges and security concerns related to the Arctic region." As
climate change has resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access to
resources in the Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United
States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden
--- and non-Arctic states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a
few --- have grown. The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of
oil, gas, and minerals that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states. A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as China, are finding investment
opportunities with Arctic states to build infrastructure as part of the
Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt and Road Initiative), [[it is by no
means a necessity to treat Chinese influence as inherently
negative]{.underline}]{.mark}. By the same logic, [[Russian]{.mark}
investment and military [actions]{.mark} in the Arctic [might
seem]{.mark} overtly [negative]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but it is
important to contextualize]{.mark} Russian interest in the Arctic as not
recent]{.underline}, [but historic]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline},
[[the rhetoric around these issues has treated them as critical security
risks]{.underline}, [painting the Arctic as the next theater of a new
Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}. But is the Arctic really the next
theater? [Rather than focusing on these interstate threats]{.underline},
[[there are more serious concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as
climate change]{.mark} and]{.underline} insecurities that stem from it
--- such as [[food]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[water]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[environmental]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [health security]{.mark}
concerns]{.underline} --- [that affect individuals and impact their
quality of life]{.underline}. For example, Alaskan [communities are
suffering from food insecurity]{.underline} because sea ice is melting,
causing traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise hunt, to move
elsewhere [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} decreasing their protection from
the large ocean waves that have in some cases caused [devastating
[infrastructure damage]{.mark}]{.underline}. On Little Diomede Island,
for example, a late storm caused serious damage to a water treatment
plant, leaving the town without clean water and without power. [[By
over-emphasizing]{.underline} "[hard]{.underline}" [security
issues]{.underline} [from Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} therefore, [[the
rhetoric]{.mark} surrounding Arctic politics [ignores]{.mark} other
important [questions that impact people on the
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly Indigenous people whose
livelihoods and societal resilience are threatened by climate
change]{.underline}. [The most significant concern]{.underline} when it
comes to treating the Arctic as a theater of great power competition [is
the danger]{.underline} it presents [in putting the Arctic on a
trajectory of becoming a securitized region]{.underline}.
[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} it can be argued that as it stands, [[the
Arctic is not]{.mark} a contested region or a region [fraught with
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the Middle East and parts of Africa,
[[it could be if the trajectory]{.mark} of treating the Arctic as this
region of competition and security [continues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Regions]{.mark} of the world [do not become theaters of
competition]{.mark} and conflict [overnight]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [become that way [after]{.mark} years
of [construction]{.mark} that involves a range of activities from
rhetoric and to military buildups]{.underline}. [Crimea is a telling
example of this]{.underline}, [where both Ukraine and Russia slowly
began ratcheting up bellicose discourse over time which was followed by
militarization]{.underline}. Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension
between the two states. [The Arctic]{.underline}, however, [is
not]{.underline} --- [and should not]{.underline} --- [be destined for
that end state]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}, the journalists who
report on our news, and the policymakers who create reports, [have a
choice in how we frame issues]{.underline}. [Rather than always treating
the Arctic as a place where competition is inherent]{.underline}, [we
can instead see it as a place of possible cooperation]{.underline}.
After all, [the largest security threat in the Arctic is climate
change]{.underline}. [It impacts not only the people living in the
Arctic itself]{.underline}, [but also]{.underline} states surrounding
the Arctic, and the rest of [the world]{.underline}, [as sea and ocean
levels increase]{.underline}, [oceans become desalinated]{.underline},
[and temperatures increase worldwide]{.underline}. [There is a choice to
focus on how states can and have been cooperating on this
issue]{.underline}, [thereby incentivizing further collaboration down
the line instead of thinking solely on old-school ways of thinking about
security]{.underline}. HOW TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY [While
we can think and write about geopolitical hard security issues in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [we can do so in a way that also gives airtime to
cooperation and collaboration rather than thinking solely about the
latest Russian military exercise or most recent scare about Chinese
investment in Greenland]{.underline}. [This is not to say that reporting
on Russia and China is not important or necessary]{.underline}, [but

responsibility of reporting all sides of an issue
seriously]{.underline}. On a policy level, [policymakers]{.underline}
and diplomats [can]{.underline} --- [and should]{.underline} --- [change
the framing of the Arctic in official policies]{.underline},
[speeches]{.underline}, [and critical international
organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic Council. [Security
shouldn't be only about the]{.underline} construction of new ships,
submarines, and [military]{.underline} exercises. [Planners who are
thinking about the role of militaries and institutions should consider
how security also refers to]{.underline} the [individual]{.underline}
security of Arctic residents, focusing on their ability to access food
[and]{.underline} water, potential insecurities arising from coastal
erosion --- 70% of which in the Arctic is built on currently thawing
permafrost --- as well as [societal insecurities]{.underline} that come
about from a lack of community resilience. Lastly, [there is a
tendency]{.underline} in international politics [to focus on conflictual
issues when instead we should be finding other]{.underline}, [more
cooperative issues to encourage relationship-building among actors in
the Arctic]{.underline}. [Instead of immediately pivoting to trying to
negotiate arms control treaties amongst Arctic states]{.underline},
[countries could instead find issues]{.underline}, [such as
transparency]{.underline}, [s]{.underline}earch [a]{.underline}nd

that does not require as much political capital]{.underline}.
[[These]{.mark} issues [might be framed as low-stakes but they should
not be]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly if all stakeholders want [[to

[RHETORIC MATTERS]{.underline} AFTER ALL [[It matters how we talk about
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Whaling is a great example of where
changing rhetoric has impacted policy]{.underline}. While in the first
half of the 20th century, whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect
of the economy, [anti-whaling discourse changed the depiction of
whales]{.underline} to intelligent mammals. [This transformed the
perception of whaling to morally repugnant]{.underline}. It goes to show
that [[the way we talk matters]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and it can matter
[more than material interests]{.mark} that might seem more
logical]{.underline}. [We can continue to use [bellicose
rhetoric]{.mark} to describe relations between states and [encourage

#### Our Alternative is post-structuralism - we will examine how discourse about the Arctic constructs Russia as a threatening agent. Our securitization of the Arctic creates a zone of conflict - rejecting that discourse solves

**Szczerbowicz, 2025 - prof of Social Sciences at The Institute of
International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**
\[Wojciech, May 24, Wschodnioznawstwo (Eastern Studies) "Constructing
reality through language. Russia in the Western Arctic discourse"
https://ejournals.eu/en/journal/wschodnioznawstwo/article/constructing-reality-through-language-russia-in-the-western-arctic-discourse#:\~:text=Discourse%20analysis%2C%20facilitated%20by%20AntConc,increasingly%20militarised%20and%20expansionist%20actor.\]

The increasing militarisation in the Russian Arctic has prompted a
reassessment of regional stability. While [existing research has focused
on the empirical aspects of Arctic relations -- such as military actions
and economic activities -- there is a significant gap in analyzing how
discourse shapes these dynamics]{.underline}. Specifically, [the ways in
which Western Arctic states construct and present the image of Russia in
their strategic narratives remains underexplored. Addressing this gap is
crucial for understanding the implications for the Arctic governance and
future cooperation,]{.underline} especially given Russia's aggressive
actions and their impact on regional collaboration. This study employs
[a poststructuralist theoretical framework]{.underline} to analyse the
discourse on Russia in the Arctic. Poststructuralism, which emphasises
the constructed nature of social realities, [provides a lens for
understanding how]{.underline} [language shapes political
dynamics]{.underline}. Influenced by Michel Foucault's concept of
'power-knowledge' and Jacques Derrida's deconstruction, [this approach
views the Arctic strategies as key speech acts that construct political
meaning]{.underline}. These documents articulate state interests and
identities, [shaping the perception of Russia's role in the
Arctic]{.underline}. By examining the language used in these strategies,
the study reveals how [Western Arctic states create and sustain
particular narratives about Russia, reflecting and reinforcing power
relations.]{.underline} The research analyses the Arctic strategies
published by Western Arctic states -- namely the USA, Canada, Denmark,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland -- between 2006 and 2024. These
strategies serve as primary speech acts shaping Arctic discourse. Using
AntConc software for discourse analysis, the study focuses on
identifying key terms and collocates associated with Russia[. This
approach reveals the evolution of Russia's portrayal, from a cooperative
regional player to an increasingly militarised and potentially
expansionist agent. Understanding this evolving narrative is essential
for comprehending the challenges and opportunities in the Arctic
international relations amid ongoing political shifts.]{.underline} The
methodological approach of this study is grounded in four key pillars.
The first is poststructuralism, which provides the theoretical framework
underpinning the research. This is followed by the region-building
approach and discourse analysis, which form the core methods employed in
the study. The final pillar is the application of AntConc software, a
critical tool for conducting the discourse analysis. Poststructuralism
serves as the foundational theoretical framework for this study,
particularly concerning its ontological and epistemological stances.
[Ontologically, poststructuralism rejects the notion of a fixed,
objective reality, arguing instead that social realities are constructed
through language and discourse]{.underline}. Epistemologically, it
aligns with hermeneutics, emphasising the interpretative nature of
knowledge. This approach stems from a critique of rationality and the
search for objective truth, deeply influenced by the works of Nietzsche
and Heidegger. Poststructuralism's relationship with postmodernism
further complicates its classification, as both are concerned with
deconstructing established narratives and exposing the fluidity of
meanings within discourse. In this context, Michel Foucault's concept of
'power--knowledge' becomes central. Foucault posits that knowledge is
always intertwined with power structures, and through his genealogical
method, he examines how discourses shape and are shaped by these
dynamics. Jacques Derrida's theory of deconstruction complements this by
challenging the stability of meaning within language, advocating for a
critical analysis that reveals the multiplicity and instability of
meanings. These perspectives are particularly relevant in analyzing the
Arctic discourse, where region--building narratives are continuously
constructed and reconstructed through language. The region--building
approach, as articulated by Iver Neumann, is a significant
methodological framework within area studies, a subdiscipline of
international relations. It aligns with the broader trends in new
regionalism, offering a critical perspective on how regions are
conceptualised and maintained within discourse. Central to this approach
is the notion that [regions are not pre-existing
geographical]{.underline} [objects but are instead 'imagined objects'
constructed through social and political processes]{.underline}.
Inspired by Benedict Anderson's concept of 'imagined communities',
Neumann argues that [regions, like nations, are discursively constructed
by 'region--builders' who imbue them with specific meanings and
identities.]{.underline} These region--builders, through their
narratives and actions, anchor the concept of a region in time and
space, creating a shared sense of belonging among its members.
[Neumann's approach challenges the conventional understanding of regions
as static objects. Instead, it posits that the existence of a region is
contingent upon the continuous reinforcement of its identity through
discourse.]{.underline} The region--building approach asks critical
questions about the origins of a region's conception and the intentions
behind its perpetuation. It also interrogates the criteria used to
define what is considered 'natural' within a regional context, revealing
the power dynamics at play in these definitions. Thus, regions are seen
as dynamic constructs, subject to redefinition and contestation, with
dominant narratives often emerging as hegemonic forces that shape the
region's identity and influence regional international relations.
Discourse analysis is a vital method in this study, based on the premise
that reality is discursively constructed. As Phillips and Hardy argue,
[social reality is produced and made meaningful through
discourse,]{.underline} which shapes social interactions. In this
context, [discourse is not merely language but the interaction and
context that form reality]{.underline}. For example, Arctic strategies
issued by states are discursive acts that construct the Arctic as a
geopolitical space, positioning these states as discursive
region--builders. A key technique within discourse analysis is predicate
analysis, which examines how subjects are characterised through
language. Predicates define subjects by connecting verbs and adjectives
to nouns, thereby shaping the discourse. This method reveals how various
discourses intersect and diverge, offering insights into how different
agents frame discourse. Furthermore, [discourse analysis identifies
hegemonic discourses]{.underline} -- [the dominant narratives that shape
social reality]{.underline}. By analyzing these discourses, researchers
uncover the power relations within them and how they maintain or
challenge the status quo.

[The ongoing]{.underline} [claims to OCS and maritime
resources,]{.underline} [alongside]{.underline} with [debates
about]{.underline} [the trans-continental]{.underline}
[accessibility]{.underline} [of the Arctic, has]{.underline} [attracted
considerable]{.underline} [popular and formal]{.underline} [geopolitical
speculation. According to some commentators, the Arctic is on the
threshold of a political and environmental state-change]{.underline}
(e.g. Berkman & Young, 2009). [Sea]{.underline} [ice
thinning]{.underline} in particular [is]{.underline} [held to be
primarily responsible for stimulating renewed interest in the Arctic as
a resource rich space awaiting further development and
exploitation]{.underline}. Moreover, [as a consequence of]{.underline}
[these potential shifts,]{.underline} [it is claimed that we are
witnessing the prospect of further schisms emerging over maritime
claims]{.underline} [to the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}. As Berkman and
Young (2009: 339) warn, "The Arctic could slide into a new era featuring
jurisdictional conflicts, increasingly severe clashes over the
extraction of natural resources, and the emergence of a new 'great game'
among the global powers". [Claims to OCS are]{.underline}
[only]{.underline} [one element]{.underline}, therefore,
[in]{.underline} [a wider discursive reconfiguration]{.underline} [of
the Arctic. Repeated warnings]{.underline} [concerning the thinning
of]{.underline} [Arctic sea]{.underline} [ice]{.underline} [have
contributed to increasingly strategic debate concerning]{.underline}
[the region\'s]{.underline} [accessibility not only in the form of
shipping lanes]{.underline} (e.g. the Northwest Passage and Northern Sea
Route) [but also as an energy/resource frontier]{.underline}. [What is
at stake]{.underline} [here]{.underline}, I believe, [is]{.underline} [a
competing sense of territorial legibility, most notably over the
maritime Arctic.]{.underline} [The ongoing attempt]{.underline} [of the
coastal states]{.underline} [to map and survey]{.underline}
[their]{.underline} [continental shelves is one powerful manifestation
of that desire]{.underline}, in the words of the US led Extended
Continental Shelf Project, [for]{.underline} ['certainty' and
'recognition'. Informing,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} indeed
[enhancing,]{.underline} [that desire]{.underline} [for
those]{.underline} [aforementioned qualities]{.underline} [is
a]{.underline} [whole]{.underline} [series of 'bordering
practices']{.underline} [ranging from demarcating the outer continental
shelf to speculating about new fears of illegal trans-shipment and
illicit flows through an ice-free Arctic. What]{.underline}, however,
[is clear is that those Arctic coastal states seeking 'certainty' and
'recognition' will have to do so in a world much changed from the Cold
War era when extra-territorial actors and indigenous communities were
either marginal or]{.underline} [marginalised,

### \--AT Arctic Threats Real

#### US focus on security in the Arctic focuses on Russia and China - we don't actually need the Arctic for security

**Caldon, 2023 - professor of National Security at the Air Force
University** \[Josh, April 13, Center for International Maritime
Security, Why the US is Losing The Race for the Arctic and What to Do
About It,
https://cimsec.org/why-the-us-is-losing-the-race-for-the-arctic-and-what-to-do-about-it/\]

[Almost weekly there is another story insinuating that the US is losing
the "race for the Arctic." Those who support the claim that the US is
losing this race often highlight]{.underline} that the Arctic ice is
melting and that this environmental change is opening up potential trade
routes and making natural resources more ripe for exploitation. Others
then point out [that Russia has increasingly re-militarized the Arctic
and that China has also made inroads to establish itself in the
region]{.underline}. One key point these articles often make is the
United States' relative lack of icebreakers compared to its competitors.
[What is missing from this conversation, however, is an explanation of
why the US has fallen behind its competitors in the Arctic.]{.underline}
This article fills in that gap by attempting to explain why the US is
behaving as it does. It then argues that paradoxically [falling behind
in this regional competition may actually improve America's overall
security and international influence when compared to Russia and
China.]{.underline} Geography [The US is relatively fortunate in its
geography]{.underline}. It has large coastlines with natural harbors on
both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Its rivers largely flow southward
to southern ports. It also [shares borders with Mexico and Canada, two
countries that do not threaten the US in a conventional sense. This
geography serves to protect the US from foreign invasion and allows it
to readily deploy military forces to foreign locales, without use of the
Arctic]{.underline}.With the advent of intercontinental missiles and
strategic bombers, [the Arctic became more important to the US
militarily during the Cold War. This pushed the US to erect now largely
defunct early warning stations across northern Alaska, Greenland, and
Canada]{.underline}. More recently, it established incipient missile
defense systems in the Arctic to deal with increased threats emanating
from Russia, China, and North Korea and improved its ability to monitor
the region. However[, these systems have never been designed to control
the Arctic, but instead to protect America, and its NATO allies, from
foreign military threats coming from, or through, the
Arctic]{.underline}. This is an important distinction.

### \--AT Arctic Key to US Economy

#### The US does not need to expand into the Arctic - it is not necessary for the US economically

**Caldon, 2023 - professor of National Security at the Air Force
University** \[Josh, April 13, Center for International Maritime
Security, Why the US is Losing The Race for the Arctic and What to Do
About It,
https://cimsec.org/why-the-us-is-losing-the-race-for-the-arctic-and-what-to-do-about-it/\]

[The US largely has a free-market economy with strong interest groups
that challenge its willingness to expand its commercial footprint in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [This has overwhelmingly kept it from attempting to
control the Arctic like Russia has done and China is increasingly
attempting to do.]{.underline} It is important to look at the times when
American commercial interests have focused on the Arctic to understand
America's overall lack of interest in this region. The three times the
US has been economically drawn to the Arctic were to exploit temporarily
scarce resources. This occurred with whale oil and seal skins during the
18th and 19th century, gold at the end of the 19th century, and oil
during the mid-twentieth century. These intense periods of economic
interest in the Arctic resulted in America's purchase of Alaska from
Russia in 1867 and the development of Alaska in the decades afterwards.
Notably, however[, it is expensive and difficult to operate in the
Arctic]{.underline}. As Canadian Arctic expert, Michael Byers
highlights, even as the Arctic ice slowly melts, [the region remains in
complete darkness for half of the year and melting ice is dangerously
unpredictable.]{.underline} The Arctic is also austere and quite far
from the largest population centers of the world. [As such, the
intermittent economic demands for the region's natural resources have
relatively quickly resulted in substitutes being found for these goods
in less austere places]{.underline}. [Subsequently, the only portions of
Alaska that are significantly developed are in the sub-Arctic portion of
the state, with the exception of the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay -- which
also appear to be winding down with the advent of fracking and renewable
energy]{.underline}. Increasing environmental concerns (most of Alaska
is situated in nationally owned wilderness preserves) and native groups'
claims prohibitively increase the price of resource extraction from most
of Arctic Alaska even further. Many Americans believe the region should
be left to nature and to indigenous groups. [The US also does not have a
great need to develop the sea routes in the Arctic to improve its
international trade]{.underline}. It has a transnational road and
railway system and easy access to maritime trade routes which are
connected through the recently enlarged Suez Canal. These circumstances
mean that the US has very little motivation to establish sea routes
through the largely uninhabited, relatively shallow, and dangerously
unpredictable Arctic Ocean. Finally, Russia's aggression over the last
two decades, and increasing pressure from environmentally-based NGOs,
have pushed American-based companies even further away from Russia's
Arctic. [All told, since the US has only marginal economic incentives to
pursue the Arctic, it has not felt the need to develop harbors,
settlements, transport infrastructure, or icebreakers to increase its
footprint in the region. As such, it has relatively little capability to
"conquer the region,"]{.underline} but also relatively little to defend
in the region.

[we hope to contribute to a "securitization of securitization," as "the

Whether you read US Army and Coastal Guard Strategies from other Arctic
states or the front page of the New York Times, [the Arctic is becoming
nearly synonymous with fears]{.underline} about Russia and China.
Military [strategists and journalists]{.underline} alike [write about
Russian militarization as well as unwelcome Chinese
influence]{.underline} in the High North. [While there are certainly
geopolitical realities to take into consideration [when thinking about
Arctic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in [focusing too heavily on
questions of]{.mark}]{.underline} ["[hard]{.underline}"
[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, [policymakers are obscuring other
transnational issues]{.underline}, [such as climate change and cyber
security]{.underline}, [where cooperation is not only desired but also
necessary]{.underline}. In other words, [discussing interstate
competition too much [leads the Arctic on a trajectory toward becoming a
securitized region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline}, [it doesn't
have to be this way]{.underline}. [This trend can]{.underline} --- [and
should]{.underline} --- [be reversed to mitigate possible
consequences]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline}: [[Focusing on how
cooperation can be used to solve key issues in the Arctic rather than
thinking solely about military buildup]{.underline}; [changing the
framing of the Arctic in official
policie]{.underline}]{.mark}[s]{.underline}, [speeches]{.underline},
[and critical international organizations]{.underline}, such as the
Arctic Council, [and finding low-stakes issues to encourage
relationship-building]{.underline} among actors in the Arctic. So, can
the Arctic be spared from securitization? EARLY SYMPTOMS OF
SECURITIZATION [[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} is the process of
something becoming a security threat or a security issue. It [[happens
when something]{.underline}]{.mark} --- such as immigration --- [[is
labeled as]{.mark} dangerous]{.underline}, [threatening]{.underline},
[and as [an existential crisis]{.mark} by someone]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} then [that framing is accepted by an
audience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, securitization implies that
security issues are not just out there. Instead, [[by creating security
threats in the way we speak]{.underline}, [we create security
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the Arctic might seem like a
peripheral region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to
rise in importance. [[Concerns about]{.mark} China]{.underline},
[[Russia]{.underline},]{.mark} [and resource competition [are causing
real changes to occur in]{.mark} how states treat [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has
announced the establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be
housed within the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique
challenges and security concerns related to the Arctic region." As
climate change has resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access to
resources in the Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United
States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden
--- and non-Arctic states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a
few --- have grown. The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of
oil, gas, and minerals that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states. A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as China, are finding investment
opportunities with Arctic states to build infrastructure as part of the
Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt and Road Initiative), [it is by no
means a necessity to treat Chinese influence as inherently
negative]{.underline}. By the same logic, [[Russian]{.mark} investment
and military [actions]{.mark} in the Arctic [might seem]{.mark} overtly
[negative]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but it is important to
contextualize]{.mark} [Russian interest in the Arctic as not
recent]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but historic]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline},]{.mark} [[the rhetoric around these issues has
treated them as critical security risks]{.underline}, [painting the
Arctic as the next theater of a new Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
is the Arctic really the next theater? [Rather than focusing on these
interstate threats]{.underline}, [there are more serious
concerns]{.underline}, [such as climate change and]{.underline}
insecurities that stem from it --- such as [food]{.underline},
[water]{.underline}, [environmental]{.underline}, [and health security
concerns]{.underline} --- [that affect individuals and impact their
quality of life]{.underline}. For example, Alaskan [communities are
suffering from food insecurity]{.underline} because sea ice is melting,
causing traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise hunt, to move
elsewhere [and]{.underline} decreasing their protection from the large
ocean waves that have in some cases caused [devastating infrastructure
damage]{.underline}. On Little Diomede Island, for example, a late storm
caused serious damage to a water treatment plant, leaving the town
without clean water and without power. [[By
over-emphasizing]{.underline} "[hard]{.underline}" [security
issues]{.underline} [from Russia]{.underline} ]{.mark}[and
China,]{.underline} therefore, [[the rhetoric]{.mark} surrounding Arctic
politics [ignores other]{.mark} important questions that impact people
on the ground]{.underline}, [particularly Indigenous people whose
livelihoods and societal resilience are threatened by climate
change]{.underline}. [The most significant concern]{.underline} when it
comes to treating the Arctic as a theater of great power competition [is
the danger]{.underline} it presents [in putting the Arctic on a
trajectory of becoming a securitized region]{.underline}.
[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} it can be argued that as it stands, [[the
Arctic is not]{.mark} a contested region or a region [fraught with
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the Middle East and parts of Africa,
[[it could be if the trajectory]{.mark} of treating the Arctic as this
region of competition and security [continues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Regions]{.mark} of the world [do not become theaters of competition
and conflict overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but]{.underline}]{.mark}
instead [become that way [after years of construction]{.mark} that
involves a range of activities from rhetoric and to military
buildups]{.underline}. [Crimea is a telling example of
this]{.underline}, [where both Ukraine and Russia slowly began
ratcheting up bellicose discourse over time which was followed by
militarization]{.underline}. Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension
between the two states. [The Arctic]{.underline}, however, [is
not]{.underline} --- [and should not]{.underline} --- [be destined for
that end state]{.underline}[. [We]{.underline},]{.mark} the journalists
who report on our news, and the policymakers who create reports, [[have
a choice in how we frame issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Rather than
always treating the Arctic as a place where competition is
inherent]{.underline}, [we can instead see it as a place of possible
cooperation]{.underline}. After all, [the largest security threat in the
Arctic is climate change]{.underline}. [It impacts not only the people
living in the Arctic itself]{.underline}, [but also]{.underline} states
surrounding the Arctic, and the rest of [the world]{.underline}, [as sea
and ocean levels increase]{.underline}, [oceans become
desalinated]{.underline}, [and temperatures increase
worldwide]{.underline}. [There is a choice to focus on how states can
and have been cooperating on this issue]{.underline}, [thereby
incentivizing further collaboration down the line instead of thinking
solely on old-school ways of thinking about security]{.underline}. HOW
TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY [While we can think and write
about geopolitical hard security issues in the Arctic]{.underline}, [we
can do so in a way that also gives airtime to cooperation and
collaboration rather than thinking solely about the latest Russian
military exercise or most recent scare about Chinese investment in
Greenland]{.underline}. [This is not to say that reporting on Russia and
China is not important or necessary]{.underline}, [but
rather]{.underline}, [reporting in a balanced way that takes the
responsibility of reporting all sides of an issue
seriously]{.underline}. On a policy level,
[[policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and diplomats [[can]{.underline} ---
[and should]{.underline} --- [change the framing of the Arctic in
official policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [speeches]{.underline}, [and
critical international organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic
Council. [Security shouldn't be only about the]{.underline} construction
of new ships, submarines, and [military]{.underline} exercises.
[Planners who are thinking about the role of militaries and institutions
should consider how security also refers to]{.underline} the
[individual]{.underline} security of Arctic residents, focusing on their
ability to access food [and]{.underline} water, potential insecurities
arising from coastal erosion --- 70% of which in the Arctic is built on
currently thawing permafrost --- as well as [societal
insecurities]{.underline} that come about from a lack of community
resilience. Lastly, [there is a tendency]{.underline} in international
politics [to focus on conflictual issues when instead we should be
finding other]{.underline}, [more cooperative issues to encourage
relationship-building among actors in the Arctic]{.underline}. [Instead
of immediately pivoting to trying to negotiate arms control treaties
amongst Arctic states]{.underline}, [countries could instead find
issues]{.underline}, [such as transparency]{.underline},
[s]{.underline}earch [a]{.underline}nd [r]{.underline}escue
[cooperation]{.underline}, [and pollution clean-up that does not require
as much political capital]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} issues [might be
framed as low-stakes but they should not be]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly if all stakeholders want [[to ensure that the Arctic is not
securitized]{.underline}]{.mark}. [RHETORIC MATTERS]{.underline} AFTER
ALL [[It matters how we talk about the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Whaling is a great example of where changing rhetoric has impacted
policy]{.underline}. While in the first half of the 20th century,
whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect of the economy,
[anti-whaling discourse changed the depiction of whales]{.underline} to
intelligent mammals. [This transformed the perception of whaling to
morally repugnant]{.underline}. It goes to show that [[the way we talk
matters]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and it can matter [more than material
interests]{.mark} that might seem more logical]{.underline}. [We can
continue to use [bellicose rhetoric]{.mark} to describe relations
between states and [encourage militarization]{.mark} on every
side]{.underline}, [but [that will end]{.mark} exactly [the way
worse-case scenarios describe it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Instead]{.underline}, [we can]{.underline} --- [and should]{.underline}
--- [change the way we talk and think about the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to focus on cooperation]{.underline},
[change the way we frame the region]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [find low-stakes issues on which to cooperate
and]{.underline} hopefully [[reverse or]{.mark} at least [slow the
trajectory of securitizing the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Demonizing rhetoric causes us to be "certain" that Russia is hostile. This relies on a realist assumption of the security dilemma. 

**Wilhelmsen and Hjermann, 2022 - Research Professor and Head of the
Research group for Russia, Asia and International Trade at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs.** \[Julie and Anni, Mar 9,
arcticreview "Russian Certainty of NATO Hostility: Repercussions in the
Arctic"
<http://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3378/6334>"\]

2 Theory and methodology The security dilemma in its classic
articulations explains how defensive measures can lead to unintended
consequences and unwanted conflict.9 As reformulated by Wivel in 2017,
[a security dilemma is "a situation in which actions taken by a state to
increase its own security cause reactions from other states, which in
turn lead to a decrease rather than an increase in the original states'
security".10 Thus, one party's actions motivated by a desire for
security could be perceived by the other as offensive and
threatening]{.underline}. In line with recent scholarship, we propose a
constructivist reading of the security dilemma as a suitable theoretical
lens for grasping the basics of the new Russia--NATO rivalry in Europe
and the Arctic. Like Van Rythoven11 we contend that [the
dilemma's]{.underline} classical formulation, with its [core elements of
uncertain]{.underline}ty, choice, and tragedy, [gains analytical clout
when informed by constructivist scholarship]{.underline}: we employ his
reconceptualization of the securitization dilemma, highlighting social
interaction, interpretation, and process. We show how [Russia
increasingly discounts uncertainty about the intentions behind NATO's
activities, with the prospect of a tragic outcome, an unwanted conflict.
Reinterpreted with constructivist assumptions, the uncertainty of the
security dilemma is not, as neorealism would posit, "a problem of
lacking information about others' intentions".]{.underline}12 Rather
than trying to unveil intention as some intrinsic quality of the
adversary, [judging intention is a matter of
interpretation]{.underline}.13 As Mitzen notes, "\[s\]tates do not have
the final say in whether they are security-seekers".14 [States come to
"know" each other as friendly or hostile through social, discursive
interaction]{.underline}. Official [political speech that promotes an
image of the other party as a threat can gradually naturalize
assumptions of hostility,]{.underline}15 [resulting in misplaced
certainty]{.underline}16 [and a powerful securitization
dilemma]{.underline}.17 [Intense and repeated political agitation
describing the other as threatening misleads actors to discount
uncertainty and fosters the epistemological hubris that they "know"
their adversaries.]{.underline} We see such a securitization dilemma in
Russia--West relations where, as already suggested in the scholarly
literature, the entrenched Russian worldview is that the West is
threatening to destroy Russia (be it through communication or force
deployment).18 [Viewed through our discourse-theoretical lens, Russia's
contributions to the current spiral in military posturing and build-up
become possible through the multitude of self/other representations in
Russian official texts]{.underline} undergirding this worldview.
Intersubjective, discursive formations such as self/other
identifications enable and constrain the policies of the political
entities that evoke them and the international relations these entities
contribute to creating. Here we concur with claims made within a
tradition now firmly established,19 including scholarship on Russian
foreign/security policy.20

#### Our Alternative is post-structuralism - we will examine how discourse about Russia in the Arctic constructs Russia as a threatening agent. Our securitization of the Arctic creates a zone of conflict

reality through language. Russia in the Western Arctic discourse"

The increasing militarisation in the Russian Arctic has prompted a
reassessment of regional stability. While [existing research has focused
on the empirical aspects of Arctic relations -- such as military actions
and economic activities -- there is a significant gap in analyzing how
discourse shapes these dynamics]{.underline}. Specifically, [the ways in
which Western Arctic states construct and present the image of Russia in
their strategic narratives remains underexplored. Addressing this gap is
crucial for understanding the implications for the Arctic governance and
future cooperation,]{.underline} especially given Russia's aggressive
actions and their impact on regional collaboration. This study employs
[a poststructuralist theoretical framework]{.underline} to analyse the
discourse on Russia in the Arctic. Poststructuralism, which emphasises
the constructed nature of social realities, [provides a lens for
understanding how]{.underline} [language shapes political
dynamics]{.underline}. Influenced by Michel Foucault's concept of
'power-knowledge' and Jacques Derrida's deconstruction, [this approach
views the Arctic strategies as key speech acts that construct political
meaning]{.underline}. These documents articulate state interests and
identities, [shaping the perception of Russia's role in the
Arctic]{.underline}. By examining the language used in these strategies,
the study reveals how [Western Arctic states create and sustain
particular narratives about Russia, reflecting and reinforcing power
relations.]{.underline} The research analyses the Arctic strategies
published by Western Arctic states -- namely the USA, Canada, Denmark,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland -- between 2006 and 2024. These
strategies serve as primary speech acts shaping Arctic discourse. Using
AntConc software for discourse analysis, the study focuses on
identifying key terms and collocates associated with Russia[. This
approach reveals the evolution of Russia's portrayal, from a cooperative
regional player to an increasingly militarised and potentially
expansionist agent. Understanding this evolving narrative is essential
for comprehending the challenges and opportunities in the Arctic
international relations amid ongoing political shifts.]{.underline} The
methodological approach of this study is grounded in four key pillars.
The first is poststructuralism, which provides the theoretical framework
underpinning the research. This is followed by the region-building
approach and discourse analysis, which form the core methods employed in
the study. The final pillar is the application of AntConc software, a
critical tool for conducting the discourse analysis. Poststructuralism
serves as the foundational theoretical framework for this study,
particularly concerning its ontological and epistemological stances.
[Ontologically, poststructuralism rejects the notion of a fixed,
objective reality, arguing instead that social realities are constructed
through language and discourse]{.underline}. Epistemologically, it
aligns with hermeneutics, emphasising the interpretative nature of
knowledge. This approach stems from a critique of rationality and the
search for objective truth, deeply influenced by the works of Nietzsche
and Heidegger. Poststructuralism's relationship with postmodernism
further complicates its classification, as both are concerned with
deconstructing established narratives and exposing the fluidity of
meanings within discourse. In this context, Michel Foucault's concept of
'power--knowledge' becomes central. Foucault posits that knowledge is
always intertwined with power structures, and through his genealogical
method, he examines how discourses shape and are shaped by these
dynamics. Jacques Derrida's theory of deconstruction complements this by
challenging the stability of meaning within language, advocating for a
critical analysis that reveals the multiplicity and instability of
meanings. These perspectives are particularly relevant in analyzing the
Arctic discourse, where region--building narratives are continuously
constructed and reconstructed through language. The region--building
approach, as articulated by Iver Neumann, is a significant
methodological framework within area studies, a subdiscipline of
international relations. It aligns with the broader trends in new
regionalism, offering a critical perspective on how regions are
conceptualised and maintained within discourse. Central to this approach
is the notion that [regions are not pre-existing
geographical]{.underline} [objects but are instead 'imagined objects'
constructed through social and political processes]{.underline}.
Inspired by Benedict Anderson's concept of 'imagined communities',
Neumann argues that [regions, like nations, are discursively constructed
by 'region--builders' who imbue them with specific meanings and
identities.]{.underline} These region--builders, through their
narratives and actions, anchor the concept of a region in time and
space, creating a shared sense of belonging among its members.
[Neumann's approach challenges the conventional understanding of regions
as static objects. Instead, it posits that the existence of a region is
contingent upon the continuous reinforcement of its identity through
discourse.]{.underline} The region--building approach asks critical
questions about the origins of a region's conception and the intentions
behind its perpetuation. It also interrogates the criteria used to
define what is considered 'natural' within a regional context, revealing
the power dynamics at play in these definitions. Thus, regions are seen
as dynamic constructs, subject to redefinition and contestation, with
dominant narratives often emerging as hegemonic forces that shape the
region's identity and influence regional international relations.
Discourse analysis is a vital method in this study, based on the premise
that reality is discursively constructed. As Phillips and Hardy argue,
[social reality is produced and made meaningful through
discourse,]{.underline} which shapes social interactions. In this
context, [discourse is not merely language but the interaction and
context that form reality]{.underline}. For example, Arctic strategies
issued by states are discursive acts that construct the Arctic as a
geopolitical space, positioning these states as discursive
region--builders. A key technique within discourse analysis is predicate
analysis, which examines how subjects are characterised through
language. Predicates define subjects by connecting verbs and adjectives
to nouns, thereby shaping the discourse. This method reveals how various
discourses intersect and diverge, offering insights into how different
agents frame discourse. Furthermore, [discourse analysis identifies
hegemonic discourses]{.underline} -- [the dominant narratives that shape
social reality]{.underline}. By analyzing these discourses, researchers
uncover the power relations within them and how they maintain or
challenge the status quo.

#### Discourse constructs Arctic Reality - how the west talks about Russia in the Arctic creates political meaning

**Szczerbowicz, 2025 - prof of Social Sciences at The Institute of
International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**
\[Wojciech, May 24, Wschodnioznawstwo (Eastern Studies) "Constructing
reality through language. Russia in the Western Arctic discourse"

[The Arctic has often been viewed as a region insulated from broader
global conflicts]{.underline}, a concept known as 'Arctic
exceptionalism'. However, [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
2022 has challenged this notion, leading to growing tensions and
increased militarisation]{.underline}. [This study uses a
poststructuralist framework to analyse the Arctic strategies published
by Western Arctic states]{.underline} between 2006 and 2024, [treating
these strategies as key speech acts that construct political meaning.
Discourse analysis,]{.underline} facilitated by AntConc software,
[examines how Western Arctic states frame Russia]{.underline} and how
these narratives have evolved. The findings reveal [a shift from
portraying Russia as a cooperative partner to an increasingly
militarised and expansionist actor.]{.underline} This shift reflects
contrasting approaches -- Western states focus on multilateralism and
international law, while Russia emphasises sovereignty and military
power. [The poststructuralist approach highlights how]{.underline}
[discourse actively constructs Arctic political realities, influencing
power dynamics and regional stability.]{.underline} Future Arctic
governance depends on resolving broader political tensions, but
meaningful re--engagement with Russia remains uncertain. Sustaining
multilateralism and adherence to international law will be crucial to
counter destabilising narratives and support a cooperative and peaceful
Arctic. The Arctic has long been perceived as a region insulated from
broader global conflicts, a concept often referred to as 'Arctic
exceptionalism'[. This belief has shaped international relations in the
Arctic, particularly between Western Arctic states and
Russia,]{.underline} through institutions like the Arctic Council.
Historically, the Arctic was viewed as a zone of cooperation,
prioritising environmental protection and sustainable development over
political tensions. However, Russia's changing role -- from a
cooperative partner to an increasingly assertive agent -- has shifted
this dynamic. Key events, such as the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and
the full--scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have eroded the notion of
alleged Arctic exceptionalism, challenging assumptions that the region
could remain detached from broader political conflicts.

### \--Extend - Russia Links

**Representations of the Arctic create Russia as a threat, which shapes
reality**

**Klimenko 2019, Researcher, Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute** \[Ekaterina, 8/5/2019, Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, NARRATIVES IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA OF CONFLICT AND
COOPERATION IN THE ARCTIC,
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/sipriinsight1908.pdf\]

[The Arctic has been narrated as both a region of cooperation and a
region of conflict.]{.underline} In the 1990s, following the well-known
speech in Murmansk in 1987 by the former Russian president, Mikhail
Gorbachev, [a depiction of the northern polar region as a theatre of war
was replaced by 'desecuritization' and an emphasis on the Arctic as a
'zone of peace'.1 The increasingly visible impacts of climate change
over the past decade, including declining Arctic sea ice, have led to
the emergence of new narratives as academics, policymakers, opinion
formers and the media have speculated about future conflicts in the
Arctic over resources, territory and shipping lanes.]{.underline}2
Despite the existence of Russia--NATO security rivalry on a wider scale,
however, [the political situation in the Arctic has remained stable
since the end of the cold war.]{.underline} Furthermore, despite major
lines of conflict over Russia's annexation of Crimea, [international
cooperation in the Arctic Council has continued relatively
unscathed]{.underline}. Nonetheless, future developments are more
difficult to predict---especially given the general uncertainty in
international politics. Russia's size, together with its Arctic
capacities and strong geopolitical interests in the region, make the
country a key player in setting the course for the region's future
political development.3 There is therefore a need to better understand
how the Arctic is perceived in Russia and how such perceptions relate to
Russia's official policies on the region. [The media can play a central
role in shaping public perceptions of a given issue. In today's digital
communications landscape, media narratives that influence political
perceptions and priorities can also have geopolitical
implications]{.underline}.4 The media's interest in the Arctic has
increased substantially in the past decade. This has inspired a number
of studies of media content on this topic, with a focus on the
English-language, Russian and Norwegian media.5 Taken together, these
illustrate how the media covers topics ranging from climate change and
declining sea ice to the geopolitical race for resources and the need to
develop northern regions. [The media often highlights lines of conflict,
either between countries with different interests or between
environmental and economic development goals,]{.underline} although the
rhetoric and the emphasis of the coverage differ between countries. For
example, oil discourses figure prominently in the United States and
Norway, while the Canadian press also highlights sovereignty. Studies of
Russian press coverage of the Arctic have noted the attention paid to
hydrocarbons, economic sanctions and securitization.6 Barry
[Buzan]{.underline} et al. [define securitization as the placement of
areas of activity or subjects within frames of 'security', whereby the
use of certain mechanisms and conduct can be justified for the sake of
security, regardless of whether such areas and subjects genuinely pose a
threat]{.underline} to the well-being of the state.7 A broad search of
the web content on Russia and the Arctic highlights its dominant focus
on hydrocarbon production, and on transport issues.[8 Other themes have
also been the focus of studies of Russian media outlets, such as
environmental concerns in relation to security discourses, military
activities and the Arctic as a zone of peace and
cooperation]{.underline}. 9 Given the interlinkages between mediated
perceptions and geopolitical dynamics, studies of Russian media coverage
offer a way to understand how narratives about the Arctic might
influence Russia's role in relation to the risk of conflict and the
potential for continued peaceful political cooperation. This SIPRI
Insights on Peace and Security paper presents an analysis of how three
Russian newspapers reported on the Arctic region between 2007 and 2016,
adding breadth and depth to previous studies of Russian press coverage
of the region, which have either focused on shorter time windows or had
a narrower empirical base.10

#### Russia would perceive Western incursions into the Arctic - it makes them feel vulnerable

Institute** \[Mathieu, October 31, The Arctic Institute, Russia\'s
Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/\]

On the other hand, [from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, the impact of the war has led
Moscow to feel vulnerable in the Arctic]{.underline}. This vulnerability
is strategic (with the perceived 'expansion' of NATO) and military,
especially with regards to the impact of climate change and receding sea
ice across the AZRF. [The Russian leadership fears that a more
accessible Arctic will bring along more military activity from NATO and
its allies in the European Arctic and above North Pole
approaches]{.underline}. It also fears there will be more military
presence from the US and Canada in the Pacific Arctic -- alongside
Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and presence. [The July 2024
Ukrainian drone strike]{.underline}7) on the Olenya air base in the
northwestern Russian Arctic, where strategic bombers are stationed[,
also reinforces their sense of vulnerability -- not least by defying the
genuine effectiveness of Russian regional air defense
capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Russia would respond to increasing Western presence in the Arctic - US and British maritime operations empirically prove

**Boulègue, 2022 - Senior Research Fellow, Russia and Eurasia
Programme** \[Mathieu, 6-6-2022; Chatham House -- International Affairs

Conclusion and policy recommendations\";
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/06/militarization-russian-polar-politics/07-conclusion-and-policy-recommendations\]

Managing escalation [Military tension in the Arctic is slowly building
around demonstrations of access and presence through naval and aerial
missions]{.underline}. For example, [in May 2020, the US and the UK
conducted a maritime security operation in the Barents
Sea]{.underline}.128 [Russia denounced this operation as provocative and
responded by deploying Northern Fleet surface vessels]{.underline}.129
At the same time, recent Russian violations of the Japanese and South
Korean ADIZs indicate a similar intent to demonstrate uncontested access
for Russia (see Chapter 4). [Such activities are likely to multiply in
the short term, potentially leading to an escalatory dynamic between
Russia and NATO partners and allies. From Russia's point of view,
Western-led operations in the Arctic]{.underline} and Antarctica
[encourage the Kremlin's self-constructed perception of encirclement by
NATO]{.underline} and US forces and consequent remilitarization of both
regions. [In turn, the situation forces other coastal states to act to
counter the Russian threat --]{.underline} especially in the context of
the Russia--Ukraine conflict. Indeed, an important risk factor is linked
to potential horizontal escalation130 into and out of the region,
notably from the European Arctic to the Baltic Sea and to the North
Atlantic, as well as to northeast Asia and the Sea of Japan in the
Pacific theatre. [There are further Russian insecurities around the
status of the NSR and the perception in Moscow that Russia's
interpretation of the 'Ice clause']{.underline} (see Chapter 3) [will
soon be contested by US-led FONOPs using surface assets or
submarines.]{.underline}131 The reality, however, is quite different,
and US-led naval FONOPs through the NSR are unlikely in the short to
medium term. The US Navy has acknowledged the cost and risks linked to
such operations, and the expert community is advising caution and
restraint.132

Hard Power [The Northern Fleet is Russia's main military instrument in
the Arctic. It is used to secure the SSBN force and Arctic borders; to
assert great-power status]{.underline}; to support territorial and
resource claims, economic interests, and infrastructure; [and to counter
and deter the buildup of military forces]{.underline} by NATO members
and partners, and neutral countries, [that the Kremlin considers
threatening to Russian interests]{.underline} in the region.26 [The
importance attached to the Northern Fleet is reflected in organizational
changes that have elevated its status]{.underline}. In 2014, Russia
created an Arctic joint strategic command for the primary purpose of
providing enhanced protection to existing and planned military
installations along the NSR. As a critical component of this
reorganization, a new Arctic brigade was created. In January, the
Northern Fleet was formally designated as Russia's fifth Military
District---the first time that a fleet has been given equal stature with
one of the land Military Districts.27 [These important changes are the
manifestation of the Kremlin's 2017 announcement that the capabilities
of the Northern Fleet were being upgraded to "phase NATO out of the
Arctic."]{.underline}28 The fleet's capabilities are being modernized
with the introduction of more capable naval surface combatants, missile
and artillery units; four new brigade combat teams; a motorized infantry
brigade; and more sophisticated air defense systems, anti-ship cruise
missiles, and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.29 In addition, [facilities are
being constructed or upgraded to provide increased logistical support
for these assets]{.underline} and a planned fleet of over fifty
icebreakers.30

### \--Extend - Russia Alternative

#### A post structuralist approach to the Arctic reveals how Russia is portrayed, and how that impacts how they are constructed as a threat. This is essential to Arctic governance and cooperation

International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**

[This study revealed a clear evolution in how Western Arctic states
portray Russia, transitioning from a cooperative partner to a
militarised and potentially expansionist agent.]{.underline} The
discourse analysis of the Arctic strategies shows that while Russia's
narrative emphasises sovereignty and resource control, Western Arctic
states focus on cooperation, multilateralism, and adherence to
international law. These contrasting narratives have shaped the shifting
dynamics in Arctic relations, especially following the full--scale
invasion of Ukraine. [The poststructuralist framework was essential in
understanding how the Arctic strategies function as speech acts that
construct political meaning. Drawing from Foucault's concept of
'power--knowledge' and Derrida's deconstruction, the study demonstrated
that discourse is not merely reflective but actively constitutes
political reality in the Arctic.]{.underline} [By framing Russia in
specific ways, Western Arctic states contribute to the construction of
regional perceptions, influencing power dynamics and regional
stability.]{.underline} The region--building approach highlighted that
the Arctic is an 'imagined community' and these strategies play a
crucial role in constructing and maintaining its identity, reflecting
both internal and international priorities. The findings suggest that
[the future of the Arctic governance will depend significantly on
resolving broader political tensions.]{.underline} The diminished notion
of the Arctic exceptionalism, coupled with growing concerns over
Russia's assertive behaviour, underlines the need for policymakers to
focus on promoting sustainable development and collective security.
[Maintaining multilateralism and inclusive cooperation is crucial to
counterbalance narratives that promote militarisation and exclusion,
thereby sustaining regional stability.]{.underline} This study is not
without limitations. The analysis focused exclusively on
English-language Arctic strategies, meaning some nuances present in
native-language documents may have been overlooked. Additionally, the
study primarily examined Western narratives; future research should
incorporate an in-depth analysis of Russia's internal discourse on the
Arctic for a more balanced perspective. Expanding the analysis to
include non-Arctic states and indigenous communities could also provide
a fuller understanding of evolving Arctic narratives and possibilities
for more inclusive governance. [The use of the poststructuralist
framework,]{.underline} combined with discourse and region-building
analyses, [proved effective in highlighting the power of language in
shaping international relations in the Arctic. Discourse not only
describes but also constructs reality, influencing the Arctic's future
as a zone of either cooperation or conflict.]{.underline} Ensuring that
the Arctic strategies emphasise multilateralism, sustainability, and
adherence to international law will be key to countering destabilising
narratives, ultimately supporting a cooperative and peaceful Arctic amid
ongoing political challenges.

**A critical geopolitical focus helps us understand how the Arctic is in
the real world - examining Russian media sources is crucial**

**Klimenko 2019, Researcher, Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute** \[Ekaterina, 8/5/2019, Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, NARRATIVES IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA OF CONFLICT AND
COOPERATION IN THE ARCTIC,
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/sipriinsight1908.pdf\]

Against this background of shifting focuses of and parallel discourses
on military security, on the one hand, and an emphasis on international
cooperation, on the other, it is difficult to predict how Russia's role
in the Arctic might develop in the future. However, a closer look at how
the Arctic is being debated within Russia and how these discourses have
evolved over the past decade provides a basis for identifying priorities
and interests that are likely to drive future developments. [The study
is based on an analysis of Russian media narratives in the context of a
media system that has been described as 'neo-authoritarian'.26 Most
media outlets are controlled by the government]{.underline}. Even if
there is no pre-publication censorship, economic and political pressures
are used and freedom of speech is thus circumscribed in practice. There
are few independent voices. III. Methodology [Constructions and
perceptions play an important role in geopolitics---an insight that
serves as a cornerstone of critical]{.underline} geopolitics, as well as
a growing array of studies of [Arctic geopolitics.27 A meaningful
methodological tool for studying different perceptions is to analyse how
an issue is framed,]{.underline} for example, [in media
coverage]{.underline}. According to frame theory, [frames provide an
overarching logic that relates new information to earlier understandings
of the world]{.underline} while also excluding or reinterpreting
information that does not fit preconceived notions.28 [An analytical
focus on the context in which an event or issue is placed in news
coverage helps to reveal the logic that situates a specific story within
a given political discourse.]{.underline} In the study of three Russian
media outlets presented below, seven analytical frames (see table 1) are
used to build on earlier studies of the media and Arctic governance: (a)
social progress and human well-being; (b) economic development and
competitiveness; (c) morality and ethics; (d) science and technology;
(e) the environment and environmental change; (f) governing and
politics; and (g) conflict and strategy.29

### \--Extend - Russia Framework

#### Russia sees its militarization as defensive - the US portrays it as uncooperative - whoever gets to frame the region determines its stability

**Szczerbowicz, 2025 - prof of Social Sciences at The Institute of
International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**
\[Wojciech, May 24, Wschodnioznawstwo (Eastern Studies) "Constructing
reality through language. Russia in the Western Arctic discourse"
https://ejournals.eu/en/journal/wschodnioznawstwo/article/constructing-reality-through-language-russia-in-the-western-arctic-discourse#:\~:text=Discourse%20analysis%2C%20facilitated%20by%20AntConc,increasingly%20militarised%20and%20expansionist%20actor.\]

[The discourse analysis reveals significant differences between how
Russia and Western Arctic states frame their roles in the Arctic.
Western states emphasise cooperation, collective governance, and
adherence to international law, particularly UNCLOS, to maintain
stability. In contrast, Russia stresses sovereignty and asserts itself
as the key Arctic region--builder due to its vast territory and economic
interests.]{.underline} This divergence became more pronounced following
the full--scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which undermined the notion
of the Arctic exceptionalism and increased concerns about regional
militarisation. Western states have aimed to integrate Russia into
multilateral cooperation, as seen since the 1991 AEPS, to maintain a
stable status quo. However, Russia's centralised Arctic policy, its
authoritarian system, and its readiness to use military power
differentiate it sharply from its Western counterparts, who operate
within democratic structures and collaborate through NATO or the EU.
[Russia frames its militarisation as defensive, a response to perceived
NATO threats, while Western states see these actions as indicative of
expansionist ambitions reminiscent of its past aggressions in Georgia
and Ukraine.]{.underline} Economically, Russia prioritises resource
extraction, often sidelining environmental concerns, whereas Western
states emphasise sustainable development and indigenous rights. Russia's
partnership with China, particularly post-sanctions, also contrasts with
the Western narrative, which seeks to limit non-Arctic agents'
influence. [These differences in discourse -- sovereignty versus
cooperation, militarisation versus stability -- highlight contrasting
visions for the Arctic's future]{.underline}.

### \--AT Russia is a Threat

It can be [difficult to see past]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline}
[rhetoric]{.underline}, deliberately provocative acts, and grandiose
statements about its Arctic plans [and threats]{.underline} to them,
[and to acknowledge that its]{.underline} [bark]{.underline} [so

[Russia's]{.underline} [ambitions]{.underline} [far]{.underline}
[exceed]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} [it has
to realize them]{.underline}. Thus, while [it is]{.underline}
[essential]{.underline} [not to yield to Russia's posturing, it is
equally important not]{.underline} [to overreact]{.underline} [to
it.]{.underline} [Notwithstanding the seeming novelty of the
situation]{.underline}---changing climate, NATO's new frontier in
Eastern Europe, China's growing footprint in the Arctic, and so

behind it are]{.underline} [part of]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
[long-standing]{.underline} [historical]{.underline}
[pattern]{.underline}. Its [confrontation]{.underline} [with the West

resources]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [crucial for]{.underline} [its

the country's security establishment, [Russia is]{.underline} [playing
defense rather than offense.]{.underline} Moreover, [Russia]{.underline}
[is confronting the West in vastly diminished
circumstances]{.underline}. Its [economy]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[stagnant]{.underline}, its [population]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[declining]{.underline}, and it is [diplomatically isolated]{.underline}
[in Europe and among the Arctic states]{.underline}---almost entirely
[thanks to its own actions]{.underline}. It has [rebuilt its military
capabilities after a long period of neglect and decline]{.underline},
but even this [utmost national priority is facing]{.underline} [budget
constraints]{.underline} [and technological challenges]{.underline}. In
the years to come [Russia's Arctic pursuits and posture will likely be
driven by concerns about being able to sustain its already weakened
position vis-à-vis the West.]{.underline}

#### Portraying Russia as a threat in the Arctic is false - Russia is committed to protecting sovereignty and the environment

**Klimenko, 2015 -- Researcher, Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute** \[Ekaterina, October 14, Broaden Impact, "Russia's Military
Buildup in the Arctic: Political Rhetoric vs. Reality"
https://broadenimpact.com/2015/10/russias-military-buildup-in-the-arctic-political-rhetoric-vs-reality/\]

[Though Arctic security rhetoric has significantly increased over the
last two years, the existing and planned military and paramilitary
capabilities in Russia's Arctic indicate that the goals of Russian
security policy and military forces remain the same.]{.underline} [These
goals particularly include ensuring sovereign rights, protecting borders
and maritime areas]{.underline}, and providing strategic deterrence
against NATO and the U.S. [Although the recent increase in military
activities in Russia's Arctic region has been happening since the
beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, it would be a mistake to perceive it
as Russia's reaction to the crisis.]{.underline} Most of the plans the
Kremlin is implementing were announced long before the Ukraine crisis in
the Arctic Strategies and GPV 2020. Significant increases in military
activities in 2014-2015 are a result of the long-term policy of
modernization and restructuring of the Russian armed forces, which has
finally started to produce some tangible outcomes. The scale of military
activities in the Arctic, though, is still very modest compared to the
Soviet era. It is expected that most of Russia's future military
expenses and acquisitions will not be concentrated in the Arctic region.
Since the crisis in Ukraine, significant focus has been on upgrading the
Black Sea Fleet and forces located in Crimea. Moreover, the economic
crisis Russia is facing will likely result in delays in the current pace
of implementation of the plans for military buildup in the region.
[Russia's recent military buildup in the Arctic should not be
exaggerated. Rather, it should be considered within the context of its
plans of military modernization and broader security policy
goals.]{.underline}

#### Despite tensions, Russia does not see the Arctic as a source of conflict - nothing has changed that perception

**Klimenko, 2015 -- Researcher, Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute** \[Ekaterina, October 14, Broaden Impact, "Russia's Military
Buildup in the Arctic: Political Rhetoric vs. Reality"
https://broadenimpact.com/2015/10/russias-military-buildup-in-the-arctic-political-rhetoric-vs-reality/\]

[Although over the last decade there has been concern regarding the
possible emergence of territorial conflicts or a 'resource race' in the
Arctic, in reality the Arctic has enjoyed a high level of cooperation.
Even though Russia has been strengthening its military and civil
emergency forces in the Arctic as a part of a wider program of military
modernization, the Arctic has still been regarded by experts and
policymakers in the region as a benign security
environment.]{.underline} However, against the background of the
conflict in Ukraine and Russia's tensions with the West, Russian
military build-up in the Arctic has renewed concerns regarding the
potential militarization of the region. For much of the past decade, the
Kremlin has worked actively on developing energy resources and shipping
in the Arctic region. It has built partnerships with foreign companies
and created a favorable investment environment through tax breaks and
mechanisms for partnership between the public and private sectors. In
this context, most Russian officials distanced themselves from
security-based rhetoric on the Arctic and instead underlined that Moscow
views the Arctic as a special zone of international relations where
peace and cooperation prevail over tensions. [However, since the
deterioration of relations with the West, Russia's rhetoric regarding
the Arctic has significantly changed, pointing to increasing threats to
Russia's national security and interests in the region. This has been
reflected in Russia's security documents. The task of "protecting
Russian interests in the Arctic" for the first time appeared in the
Russian Military Doctrine adopted in 2014. The Doctrine names expansion
of NATO power capacity, which endows the organization with global
functions realized through violation of the international legal norms
and moves the military infrastructure of NATO member states closer to
the borders of the Russian Federation, as number one external military
danger to Russia.]{.underline} New amendments to Russia's Maritime
Doctrine, which were adopted in July 2015, have focused on the Arctic
and Atlantic. NATO's global activities are seen as the major security
concern in the Atlantic, while Arctic's importance is determined by its
provision of limitless access to the Atlantic Ocean and by the Northern
Fleet's defense capabilities. Additionally, the Maritime Doctrine has
underlined "lowering the threats in the Arctic region" as its main goal
for Arctic policy, to be achieved through strengthening the Northern
Fleet, among other means. [Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that
Russian officials are not expecting conflict over resources or
territories in the Arctic. Despite the current tensions between Russia
and the West, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov underlined that "the
current complicated international situation does not bring any cardinal
changes to the established order."]{.underline}

### \--AT They solve Russian Threat

#### They do not solve securitization because it is caused by NATO and the US

Research group for Russia, Asia and International Trade at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs.** \[Julie and Anni, Mar 9,

Arctic"
<http://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3378/6334>"\]

3.1 A dangerous world, with NATO as its source [Official Russian texts
stress that European and global stability and security are under threat;
there is war in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and remilitarization and
rising tensions in Europe. Several state collapses have paved the way
for societal meltdown, terrorism and chaos.]{.underline} Particularly
salient is the view of an unstable situation in which order could be
replaced by chaos at any time: this description permeates the body of
Russian official texts.43 [The main source of these intensifying crises
seems to be NATO/USA/West.]{.underline} "Like lava from a volcano,
demolishing on its way everything positive, accumulated over the past
decade, [Western countries are creating new dividing lines ... the
international security system has been undermined by the actions of the
US and its allies".]{.underline}44 Accordingly, the world is often said
to be in a state of controlled instability -- which springs, as
explained below, from these entities' hybrid or false nature as regards
their intentions and activities.45 The US "exclusivity" and "arrogant"
approach to international law are "contagious bacteria" fostering
terrorism and instability.46 [The picture of the dangerous world that
NATO is contributing to create is constructed through juxtaposition to
the alternative, safe world which Russia is held to build and
represent]{.underline}: a multipolar world governed through a
polycentric system. This ideal world requires the "formation of a common
space for peace, security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area", "the
realisation of the principle of equal and indivisible security" and "the
primacy of international law and the UN".47 In contrast to NATO, the
OSCE is the "cornerstone of implementing equal and indivisible
security".48 This is a world with a "balance of interests and
compromises" rather than "force and aggression"49 where "everyone has
the right to express their point of view"50 -- in short a "new and more
just world order".51 In MOD texts this alternative order is said to be
"gaining traction".52 The MFA also notes that, post-Crimea, enmity has
become an anomaly, as the "objective trend" is problem-solving through
"collective efforts".53 Russia has hopes that "pragmatism in the
interests of international and European security" can penetrate the
"NATO system".54 However, in June 2018, the MFA noted an "increasingly
clear" "contradiction" between the West seeking to maintain dominance
and "the objectively strengthening multipolarity".55

### \--AT Russia Cooperative

#### Western countries have shifted how they portray Russia in the Arctic - we have shifted from describing Russia as cooperative to highlighting the threat that they pose.

**Szczerbowicz, 2025 - prof of Social Sciences at The Institute of
International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**

[These findings demonstrate that Arctic strategies are key speech acts
in the Arctic discourse, and their analysis highlights the dynamics
between Western Arctic states and Russia]{.underline}, capturing both
strategic concerns and cooperation. The ranking by likelihood of
collocates has provided an in-depth view of how unique words associated
with Russia reflect broader political themes and distinct narratives
within the Arctic region. [The analysis]{.underline} of collocates
reveals an evolution [in how Russia is portrayed in Western Arctic
strategies. Initially, Russia was framed as a cooperative
partner,]{.underline} evident from frequent collocates like 'cooperate',
'joint', and 'bilateral'. These terms suggest an early emphasis on
shared governance and collaboration in the Arctic. However, the
appearance of 'Ukraine' as a significant collocate marks a critical
shift, demonstrating the diminishing notion of the Arctic
exceptionalism. Russia's actions in Ukraine have highlighted that the
Arctic is not isolated but intricately connected to broader political
tensions. [Security concerns have become more prominent,]{.underline} as
suggested by collocates such as 'nuclear', 'border', and 'northwestern'.
This indicates a shift in perception, [with Russia evolving from a
collaborative neighbour to a strategic threat]{.underline}. The emphasis
on 'EEZ' (exclusive economic zone), 'territory', 'delimitation' and
'commission' reflects growing concerns over Russia's assertive actions
to reinforce its sovereignty, which are increasingly viewed as threats
to regional stability. As mentioned before, the frequent appearance of
terms like 'Norway' and 'Norwegian' highlights the overrepresentation of
Norwegian perspectives, often framing Russia in relation to shared
borders and emerging security challenges. [Overall, the discourse has
shifted from cooperation to viewing Russia as a militarised and
potentially expansionist agent, with the Arctic relations increasingly
shaped by its actions beyond the region.]{.underline}

[not]{.underline} [appear to be]{.underline} [on a
trajectory]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [establish naval
superiority]{.underline} [in the region or a true blue-water
navy]{.underline}. Most of its [capabilities]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [designed for]{.underline}

[growth in]{.underline} [infrastructure]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[intended]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [conduct nonmilitary
missions]{.underline} [such as]{.underline} [search and rescue

[maritime shipping]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [energy
and]{.underline} [economic]{.underline} [investments.]{.underline}
However, many of [Russia's military]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline} [and operations in the Arctic]{.underline}
[have]{.underline} [inherent]{.underline} [offensive]{.underline}
[potential]{.underline} [and have been used in threatening
ways]{.underline}.31 Its [air and naval forces have intimidated NATO

provocative maneuvers; have increased naval, submarine, and air patrols

drills in the region; and have used more aggressive tactics to harass
U.S. naval and air operations off the coast of Alaska]{.underline}.32
Moreover, many [Russian facilities being developed along the NSR are
dual-use, and Russian measures to improve maritime security and safety,
such as]{.underline} [improved radar surveillance]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [communications]{.underline} [or new]{.underline}

projection, infrastructure development, as well as through the use of
sub-threshold activities and gray zone operations]{.underline}. [As the
Kremlin is approaching Arctic security in more confrontational terms,
there are heightened concerns over the risks of miscalculation and
(un)intended escalation.]{.underline} Photo: Ministry of Defense of
Russia The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 did not alter
Russia's Arctic military posture. If anything, Moscow's obsessive search
for complete control over the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation
(AZRF) has been vindicated by wider geopolitical developments.
[Nevertheless, Finland's and Sweden's accession to NATO is making Russia
feel more vulnerable from a military point of view. This self-perception
of vulnerability will inform how Russia projects itself in the
region]{.underline}, especially through low intensity warfare operations
against NATO and its allies -- [which in turn raises the risk of
miscalculation and escalation in a changing Arctic.]{.underline} Posture
change in the context of 'NATO's expansion' [From Moscow's viewpoint,
the perceived 'enlargement' of NATO to Finland and Sweden is
fueling]{.underline} both [a sense of vindication and vulnerability
across the AZRF]{.underline} -- geographically extending from the North
Atlantic and the European High North, to North Pole approaches in the
Central Arctic, to the North Pacific and the Bering Strait. On the one
hand, [Russia's self-inflicted fear of 'encirclement'1) by the Atlantic
Alliance has been validated by Finland and Sweden joining
NATO]{.underline}. The double accession represents a fait accompli for
the Kremlin, honed by a self-reinforcing propagandistic narrative that
the Alliance is turning the Arctic into a 'conflict zone'2) or that
there is a 'new Cold War'3) in the region because of Western policy.
[This narrative is compounded by the recent release of the US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region]{.underline} and the US Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024, which are also denounced as 'deciding
the region's future by force'4) or 'inviting confrontation'5) in the
Arctic. [Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance further fuels the
Russian logic that the non-Russian Arctic has become 'NATO
territory']{.underline}. This ends up creating a 'NATO 7 vs. Russia'6)
approach, which tends to securitize Arctic affairs and shape discussions
increasingly in military terms. The policy consequences are that Moscow
is planning more than ever for all contingencies, including open
military confrontation in the Arctic.

#### 2. Turn - Russian aggression in the Arctic will increase - the US must react with diplomacy and deterrence

**Rumer et al, 2021 - Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at
Carnegie** \[Eugene, Richard Sokolsky, and Paul Stronski, March 29,
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Russia in the Arctic---A
Critical Examination"
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/03/russia-in-the-arctica-critical-examination?lang=en\]

[Russia's actions in the Arctic---its aggressive rhetoric and its
far-reaching territorial claims---have done little to improve its
diplomatic position there vis-à-vis other Arctic states and only
antagonized them.]{.underline} Its only partner in its Arctic pursuits
has been China, which claims that it is a "near-Arctic" state---a claim
rejected by the United States and likely viewed with suspicion by other
Arctic nations. [Considering the long-term nature of Russia's
confrontation with the West, the return to the relatively benign
geopolitical environment in the Arctic that existed there in the 1990s
is unlikely.]{.underline} Moreover, [the current situation is not due to
a misunderstanding, but rather to a clash of the two parties'
interests]{.underline}. [That leaves two broad avenues for managing the
standoff: Diplomacy]{.underline}: Although Russia may not prove
receptive, [the United States and NATO should seek areas of cooperation
where there is a convergence of interests]{.underline}, as well as to
devise rules of the road similar to those that existed during the Cold
War to reduce tensions, avoid or manage crises, and mitigate the risks
of conflict through an accident or miscalculation. [Deterrence: The
United States and NATO should continue to improve their defenses to
discourage Russia from harassing their military]{.underline} and
commercial aircraft and ships in and around the Arctic, and to ensure
that the alliance maintains the capability to execute its wartime
reinforcement plans for its northern and eastern flanks. The alliance
should continue to manage competition with Russia through a combination
of resolve and restraint, improving and demonstrating its capabilities
for defense and deterrence, but without overreacting to Russian
muscle-flexing. [Striking the right balance will be difficult and will
require communicating to Russia clearly where the allies' interests,
objectives, and redlines are.]{.underline} The allies have been there
before.

#### 3. Turn - Russian threats are real - they are using Arctic lands to establish military advantages

**Adler, 2025- European Editor** (Katya, May 23, BBC. "Tensions Rise as
Superpowers Scrap for a Piece of the Arctic"

[Russia also relies on its Arctic to store strategic weapons - mainly on
its Kola peninsula, which bristles with nuclear capabilities and is home
to its legendary Northern Fleet.]{.underline} Back in Norway, Kirkenes
residents live under that shadow of the Russian Bear next door. They
always have. The border with Russia is a 10 minutes drive away by car.
And [Kola peninsula feels uncomfortably close]{.underline}. In Cold War
times, the town became known as a nest of spies - a frontline between
the West and the Soviet Union. [Norway believes Russia is using its
Arctic to train new recruits to fight, and to fly bombers from, to
attack Ukraine. Though not directly at war with Russia,
Norway,]{.underline} and specifically the north of the country along its
roughly 200km long land border, [feels under attack.]{.underline} \"We
see it here locally,\" says Col Jørn Kviller, speaking to me by the
clear waters of the Pasvik River that separates Norway and Russia. Just
in front of us are Norway\'s bright yellow, and Russia\'s red and green,
border posts. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there have been
increasingly frequent incidents of GPS jamming that have even caused
commercial pilots to change navigation systems. Cases of espionage by
the border - \"everything from signals intelligence to agents being sent
to Norway\" - have shot up, Col Kviller tells me. [Norway and its Nato
allies are also on the alert for Russian spy submarines and other
vessels in the Arctic.]{.underline}

### \--Extend - Russia Already Securitized

#### Discourse analysis shows that the already West frames Russia as a threat, while Russian discourse frames the Arctic as crucial to their national interests.

**Szczerbowicz, 2025 - prof of Social Sciences at The Institute of
International and Security Studies at the University of Wroclaw**
\[Wojciech, May 24, Wschodnioznawstwo (Eastern Studies) "Constructing
reality through language. Russia in the Western Arctic discourse"
https://ejournals.eu/en/journal/wschodnioznawstwo/article/constructing-reality-through-language-russia-in-the-western-arctic-discourse#:\~:text=Discourse%20analysis%2C%20facilitated%20by%20AntConc,increasingly%20militarised%20and%20expansionist%20actor.\]

[The Russian government frames the Arctic as central to its national
interests, focusing on its potential for economic exploitation and
military power projection. Following a period of stagnation in the
1990s, the region regained its strategic status in Russian political
discourse]{.underline}. This is reflected in the Northern Sea Route
development project, intended as a key maritime corridor, albeit still
marginal in global shipping due to difficult ice conditions. Climate
change, which is reducing the Arctic sea ice, has been depicted as an
opportunity to expand shipping activities along the route, thereby
strengthening state\'s position in global trade. This state presents its
increased military presence in the Arctic as defensive, a response to
what it perceives as NATO\'s encroachment, while consolidating its
Arctic policy under foreign, energy, military, and maritime doctrines.
Simultaneously, [Russia portrays the actions of Western Arctic states as
provocative, positioning itself as a guardian of regional stability amid
growing political tensions]{.underline}. The Arctic strategies are
pivotal to understanding the discourse on Russia, as they represent the
most important speech acts within Arctic discourse. The nature of a
strategy lies in its character as a concrete political document [-- an
expression of will, an idea, but also a clearly articulated plan for
achieving specific goals. When formulated by an Arctic state, these
strategies become key speech acts, contributing significantly to the
construction of regional reality.]{.underline} They are embedded in a
broader process of region--building, reflecting the interplay between
domestic policy and international relations. In the Arctic context,
these strategies are not limited to specific sectors but address the
region comprehensively. The internal dimension relates to public
policies within each state, while the external dimension portrays the
Arctic as an international region, fostering a shared identity and
mutual interests among Arctic states. Thus, the Arctic strategies help
define the structure of international relations and articulate the
factors driving change in the region. [By analyzing Western Arctic
strategies]{.underline}, including both current and past documents[, it
is evident that these speech acts contribute to a hegemonic discourse,
shaping the]{.underline} political core of the [Arctic.]{.underline}
[The performative nature of these strategies underscores their crucial
role in both constructing and reflecting the evolving political
realities]{.underline} of the region. [The discourse analysis of Western
Arctic strategies]{.underline}, using AntConc, [sought to reveal how
Russia is framed in these documents]{.underline}. The analysed
strategies, published in English, underscore their international scope
and allow for a consistent comparative analysis. All 20 documents from
2006 to 2024 were converted to .txt format to be compatible with the
AntConc software. This method enables a deeper understanding of the
linguistic context in which 'Russia' is situated within these documents,
revealing underlying patterns in the articulation of political
narratives. [Such analysis not only highlights dominant themes but also
underscores the strategic framing choices employed by Western Arctic
states in their discourse]{.underline}. The category 'collocates' was
selected to examine words frequently associated with 'Russia', offering
insights into how Western Arctic states construct their narratives about
Russia.

#### Russia is already securitizing the Arctic, even though the US is not a threat

**Rumer et al, 2021 - Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at
Carnegie** \[Eugene, Richard Sokolsky, and Paul Stronski, March 29,
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Russia in the Arctic---A
Critical Examination"
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/03/russia-in-the-arctica-critical-examination?lang=en\]

Introduction During the first post--Cold War decade, Russia approached
the Arctic as an area of low tensions, where cooperation with other
powers in addressing common challenges was desirable and feasible.1
Gradually, however, [as relations with the West deteriorated, and
especially since its]{.underline} 2014 [invasion of Ukraine, Russia has
adopted a much more competitive, even confrontational, perspective on
the Arctic.]{.underline} [Instead of emphasizing the benefits of
cooperative engagement, its leaders have articulated their view of the
Arctic as a sphere of military and economic expansion, and an arena for
their great-power ambitions.2]{.underline} As a result of this changing
attitude, [Moscow has prioritized military superiority to counter what
it claims is a growing U.S./NATO challenge to its interests
there.]{.underline} [By any objective standard, U.S./NATO military
deployments in the Arctic do not currently represent a threat to
Russia's]{.underline} Northern Fleet or to its other [military assets
there]{.underline}. [The region possesses an abundance of natural
resources, especially oil and gas, but these are available elsewhere in
Russia.]{.underline} Exploring and extracting them in the Arctic
requires huge capital investments and modern technology that would
stretch its capacity. Global warming is opening up new commercial
opportunities for shipping and fishing, but there is scant
infrastructure in the region to capitalize on these opportunities, and
rectifying this deficiency will be costly. [Russia's evolving Arctic
ambitions have engendered growing concerns among other Arctic
nations]{.underline}, yet surprisingly little is known about the basis
for these ambitions. This paper therefore addresses the following
questions: What are the drivers of Russia's Arctic policy? How does it
define its interests in the region and what tools does it employ to
advance them? Who are the Russian stakeholders that would benefit from
the exploitation of the region? What are the prospects for Russia
realizing its ambitions? What are the implications of its actions and
ambitions for U.S./NATO interests and policy?

#### Russia is already securitizing the Arctic - they perceive NATO encirclement

**Boulègue, 2022 - Senior Research Fellow, Russia and Eurasia
Programme** \[Mathieu, 6-6-2022; Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank; \"The militarization of Russian polar politics: 07
Conclusion and policy recommendations\";
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/06/militarization-russian-polar-politics/07-conclusion-and-policy-recommendations\]

[Russia's policies for the polar regions]{.underline} overlap and [are
increasingly becoming militarized, as the perception of threats to
Russian national interests grows. This has direct consequences
for]{.underline} other polar nations and for [NATO and its allies. In
the Arctic, a fear of encirclement by NATO and its allies informs this
posture -- heightened by worsening relations with the West over Russia's
renewed war against Ukraine and potential NATO expansion]{.underline}.
[Another key Russian goal is to secure control over the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}, amid increased human activity prompted by climate
change. In Antarctica, [Russia perceives a need to protect its national
interests against other state parties]{.underline} to the Antarctic
Treaty System. This paper details the reasons behind Russia's
militarized postures in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It assesses
the North and South Poles as potential theatres for military activity
and geopolitical confrontation, and recommends ways to mitigate risks
for the US, NATO and their allies. 01 Introduction: Drivers of Russian
polar interests Although [Russia]{.underline} does not have a defined
common approach to the polar regions, its [postures in the
Arctic]{.underline} and Antarctica overlap, and [are securitized and
increasingly militarized.]{.underline}

#### Putin's Russia uses Propaganda to label the West as a threat - this will contaminate the Arctic

**Wilhelmsen and Hjermann, 2022 - Research Professor and Head of the
Research group for Russia, Asia and International Trade at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs.** \[Julie and Anni, Mar 9,
arcticreview "Russian Certainty of NATO Hostility: Repercussions in the
Arctic"
<http://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3378/6334>"\]

All three points are particularly salient for [today's Putinite
state]{.underline}, [where identifications in official and media
discourse have become so one-sided and repetitive that scholars attach
the label "propaganda" to Russian official rhetoric. We can hardly
expect Russian official speech on NATO activities in the Arctic to be
very different from such speech on other regions.]{.underline} [Further,
Russia's ontological security has been forged by official invocation of
an existential threat:]{.underline} first in the form of "international
terrorism," then increasingly [in the form of the "West."]{.underline}29
Thus, [we expect that invoking social entities associated with the West
as "hostile,"]{.underline} also [in connection with the Arctic, will
foster the production of ontological security]{.underline}. Finally, [in
Putin's Russia the]{.underline} Schmittian [logic has not been
circumscribed by a democratic political system and is spreading
unimpeded throughout the political system.]{.underline}30 Based on these
theoretical assumptions, we expect that [official Russian discourse on
NATO in the Arctic will evolve into a pattern of identification
consistent with identifications of NATO elsewhere]{.underline}. As to
the overall picture of Russia--West relations, [discourses of high
threat such as those detected in our analysis delineate a boundary for
acceptable action, making policies of military build-up and force
logical and legitimate]{.underline}. In a next step -- beyond the scope
of our enquiry -- it will be up to NATO and associated states to
interpret whether such Russian actions are offensive or defensive. This
judgement will be shaped by various factors, including how these
political entities themselves have represented -- spoken about -- Russia
in recent years. With this overarching theoretical approach, we
highlight the importance of spoken language and how evolving political
statements contribute to creating a dangerous strategic certainty that
drives the action-reaction spiral upwards.

### \--Extend - Turn - Deterrence Necessary

#### Russian expansions in the Arctic make security more important.

**Pechko, 2025 - fellow at the Arctic Institute** \[Kiel, January 7, The
Arctic Institute, Rising Tensions and Shifting Strategies: The Evolving
Dynamics of US Grand Strategy in the Arctic,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/rising-tensions-shifting-strategies-evolving-dynamics-us-grand-strategy-arctic/\]

[The Arctic]{.underline}, often associated with serene landscapes and
wildlife[, is not just a picturesque region but a strategically
important area shaped by environmental, political, economic, and
military forces]{.underline}. [During the Cold War, it was a
battleground between the United States]{.underline} (US), [the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR). Post-Cold War, Arctic nations sought to preserve it as
a zone of cooperation]{.underline}.1) However, the strategic competition
among the US, Russia, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) has
significantly elevated its geopolitical importance in the past decade.
[The military advancements of Russia and PRC, in contrast to slower
efforts by the US and NATO, have turned the Arctic into a critical focus
for security, resource access, and control over emerging shipping
routes]{.underline}. In 2009, [global interest]{.underline} in the
[Arctic surged when the US Geological Survey estimated the Arctic held
13 percent of the world's undiscovered]{.underline} oil and 30 percent
of the world's natural gas.2) That same year, [the US hosted the Arctic
Council Ministerial Meeting to reaffirm cooperation]{.underline}. [When
Russia asserted its claims over arctic territory, the tone shifted from
collaboration to competition.]{.underline} [Russia's tenor was not
unprecedented; in 2007, Russian submarines planted a Russian flag on the
North Pole, proclaiming, "The Arctic is Russian."]{.underline}3) [The
2013 launch of the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region set the
stage for today's geopolitical landscape]{.underline}. By 2022[, Russian
militarism and PRC's 'Polar Silk Road' ambitions prompted the US to
update its Arctic strategy]{.underline}, emphasizing military readiness,
infrastructure, and NATO collaboration.4) [The Biden administration
further prioritized investments in icebreakers, climate action, and
Indigenous involvement, striking a delicate balance between national
security and sustainable development in this increasingly contested
region]{.underline}.5)

### \--Extend - Russia Threat

 

#### Russia is militarizing the Arctic - more access means more ships which makes miscalculation more likely

**Boulègue, 2022 - Senior Research Fellow, Russia and Eurasia
Programme** \[Mathieu, 6-6-2022; Chatham House -- International Affairs
Think Tank; \"The militarization of Russian polar politics: 07
Conclusion and policy recommendations\";
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/06/militarization-russian-polar-politics/07-conclusion-and-policy-recommendations\]

[Russia's increasingly militarized posture in polar affairs has two main
consequences for Arctic coastal states]{.underline} and for the future
of the ATS: [it creates the potential for accidents and miscalculations,
and will require policies to deal with Russia--China interaction at both
poles.]{.underline} Miscalculation, accidents and tactical errors
[Russian stakeholders remain convinced that NATO is deliberately moving
closer to Russia's Arctic]{.underline} and that ATS claimant states are
not respecting Moscow's interests in the Antarctic region. [This
situation increases the risk of miscalculation and tactical errors,
which could lead to unwanted escalation.]{.underline} Polar
miscalculations At the South Pole, risks of miscalculation are linked to
Russia's increased presence and assertive posture regarding other
parties to the ATS (see Chapter 5). These are longer-term prospects but
could force the Kremlin to adopt a comprehensive and combined approach
to both poles. Indeed, a similar pattern is slowly emerging between
security issues in the Arctic and Antarctic regions -- largely as a
result of increased human activity. [In the Arctic,]{.underline} the
equation is simple: [under the impact of climate change, greater human
access to,]{.underline} and presence in, [Arctic waters (whether for
commercial, civilian or military purposes) will increase the number and
frequency of accidents and incidents both at sea]{.underline} and in the
air. [This will]{.underline}, in turn, [raise the risk of
miscalculation]{.underline}. [A greater number of surface vessels,
underwater systems and aerial platforms in the European Arctic and
Pacific Arctic -- coupled with extreme weather events and the non-linear
nature of climate change -- will make day-to-day activities such as
patrols and constabulary missions harder to manage. The Arctic is also
not immune to environmental and safety risks, notably from
nuclear-powered vessels and those carrying nuclear
missiles]{.underline}.120 This is equally true for the Southern Ocean.
[The situation is made worse by the reduction in official channels of
communication with Russia since 2014 and further deterioration since
early 2022]{.underline}. [Russia's behaviour and lack of restraint
generally are also causes for concern]{.underline} -- from its lack of
transparency in dealing with serious environmental events121 to its
military activities in peacetime. The latter include dangerous
manoeuvres against Norwegian assets;122 ADIZ violations against Japan
and South Korea; GPS-jamming in northern Finland and Norway during the
NATO 'Trident Juncture' exercise in 2018;123 snap missile drills;124 and
other military activity taking place beyond the AZRF.125 These
activities particularly impact the overall security of the Barents,
Norwegian and Bering Seas (see Chapters 2--4 for discussion of existing
chokepoints). [The risk of miscalculation is compounded by Russia's need
to 'respond' to the expansion of NATO in the European
Arctic]{.underline} (Finland and Sweden potentially joining the alliance
being a case in point)126 and NATO's supposed activities directed
against the AZRF, as well as the increased US presence in the Pacific
theatre.127 For the US, NATO and their allies[, an additional risk is
that their regional military assets could be threatened by Russian
systems, and particularly by naval aviation groups and air-superiority
assets, long-range missile systems and strategic bomber
overflights]{.underline}.

#### Russian access to Arctic oil causes military modernization - it cements Putin as leader and funds new weapons

**Rumer et al, 2021 - Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at
Carnegie** \[Eugene, Richard Sokolsky, and Paul Stronski, March 29,
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Russia in the Arctic---A
Critical Examination"
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/03/russia-in-the-arctica-critical-examination?lang=en\]

[The exploitation of Arctic riches accelerated in post-Soviet Russia.
Oil and gas played the pivotal role in restoring the country's economic
fortunes in the early 2000s, underwriting domestic stability, fostering
Putin's rise as the country's undisputed leader, and returning Russia to
the world stage]{.underline} as an aspiring great power intent upon
recouping its losses in Europe and reclaiming its rightful place in the
international system. [The role of oil and gas in Russia's Arctic
ambitions was highlighted]{.underline} in 2006 [as part of the Kremlin's
agenda to establish the country as an "energy superpower" and to justify
its inclusion in the G8]{.underline}.3 [Rising temperatures would make
those riches more accessible]{.underline} and ensure the Kremlin a
steady source of revenues as well as market and geopolitical influence
in Europe and Asia. And [without any contenders to challenge these
ambitions, Russia had a shot at securing its place as a major
geopolitical presence in the Arctic. Even the high projected costs and
technological difficulties associated with exploration and recovery of
Arctic offshore resources did not appear to pose a major obstacle to the
Kremlin's ambitions.]{.underline} Projects would be open to
participation by foreign energy companies with their technology and
capital, and their participation would make them powerful stakeholders
that could influence Western governments' policy choices toward Russia.
Moreover, thanks to the warming temperatures in the Arctic, the
development of the NSR along Russia's Arctic coastline would provide the
Kremlin with an opportunity to diversify its energy policy by eventually
linking the Russian Arctic to markets in Asia, thus reducing the
country's reliance on Europe as a critical energy market and on Ukraine
as a critical conduit to that market.4 [With oil and gas accounting for
as much as 60 percent of Russia's export revenues]{.underline} and
upward of 30 percent of its federal budget, [the motive behind its
Arctic ambitions is not difficult to discern. The revenue from these
projects would]{.underline} help sustain several critical priorities:
[further consolidation of Putin's hold on political power]{.underline}
as the leader who returned Russia from the abyss and restored it to
greatness, the accumulation of funds to hedge against future economic or
political adversity, [and the rebuilding of the military]{.underline},
which had long suffered from neglect and was in need of modernization.

#### Russia is becoming more confrontational in the Arctic - they are increasing their sub threshold reactions

**Boulègue, 2024 - Global Fellow at the Wilson's Center Polar
Institute** \[Mathieu, October 31, The Arctic Institute, Russia\'s
Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/\]

[The Kremlin is now prioritizing the completion and maintenance of
existing infrastructure]{.underline} rather than seeking to expand the
network. Moscow must also consider climate change impact and budget
constraints. As a response to the sense of vulnerability in the AZRF,
[Russia is becoming more confrontational in its approach towards
regional security and finding excuses to 'defend' itself against
perceived external threats]{.underline}. While the Kremlin is taking
stock of the consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, Russia
will likely conduct more conventional power demonstrations,
sub-threshold activities, and grey zone operations in the Arctic. While
there is little incentive for the Kremlin leadership to escalate in the
region per se, [there is also a strong willingness to continue probing
and testing the resolve of the Arctic]{.underline} 7 through a
well-established toolkit of low intensity warfare operations. [These
sub-threshold operations and grey zone activities mostly take the form
of: Brinkmanship-prone activities]{.underline}12) through offensive
peacetime maneuvers at sea and in the air, especially close to the air
defense identification zones (ADIZ) of NATO countries and NORAD,
[Regular snap military exercises]{.underline}, strategic bomber
overflights and patrol activities, and the weaponization of notices to
air missions13) (NOTAM) in the Barents Sea, across North Pole
approaches, and close to the Bering Strait and Alaska -- including with
China14), [Seabed warfare activities]{.underline}15), and notably the
disruption of critical undersea infrastructure (CUI) such as energy
pipelines and fiber optic data cables across Arctic chokepoints,
GNSS/GPS jamming and recurrent electronic warfare operations16) in
Lapland and Finnmark in the European High North -- with severe risks for
civilian and commercial assets.

#### Russia is expanding militarily in the Arctic - it will deploy nuclear subs and defend the Arctic by any means necessary

the Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines. [Particularly
crucial to Russia's plans is its fleet of nuclear submarines, which
has]{.underline}
[become](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Russia-Nuclear-Report-2021-FINAL.pdf)
[significantly more active in northern waters in the past

of [radiation

to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker fleet is
to expand by seven more vessels.

# China Kritik

### 1NC - China Threat Kritik

#### Securitization Discourse labels China as an existential threat which is used to justify an extreme response

**Ahmad, 2023 - Student Thesis from the University of Management and
Technology in Pakistan** \[Fahad, June 2023, researchgate
"Securitization of US-CHINA Relations: A Catalyst for Confrontation,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377650144_Securitization_of_US-CHINA_Relations_A_Catalyst_for_Confrontation"\]

The engagement policy of the United States greatly benefited China as it
went from a poor agricultural country to a complex industrialized
society producing almost all-important products with international
reach. Over the years, from its opening up to the world market, [China
has grown enormously and become one of the most powerful political,
economic and military power. The most important part is that China had
never resorted to war during its rise, and the rise is almost completely
peaceful with very little or minor conflicts]{.underline} (US-China
Economic, and Security Review Commission,
[2019](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#US_ChinaEconomicandSecurityReview)).
The significant rise of China within a very short span of time ignited
fear and mistrust in the bilateral relations[. The perception of China
as a responsible world player changed towards a \"strategic competitor\"
at best, and an \"existential threat\" at worst. United States now
considers China as an existential threat to its survival and the
survival of the international system which is based on American
principles. The change from positive engagement towards an existential
threat is not based on empirical evidence; rather, it shows the
subjective construction of threat so that the rise of China can be
checked by employing extraordinary measures like a trade war and actual
military standoff]{.underline} in case China tries to take over Taiwan
by force and undermine the international rule-based system. [The
Securitization of economic, political, and military relations may
further deteriorate the tense relations and increase the possibility of
further escalation]{.underline}
(Nyman, [2018](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Nyman)).
[A successful handling of the situation will be to de-securitize areas
where there is a possibility of cooperation like economic
interdependence,]{.underline} hence facilitating an environment of
peaceful coexistence from which both countries can equally benefit.
[Securitization is the process through which threats are created through
discourse so that extraordinary measures against that threat can be
justified]{.underline}. As the US labels China as an existential threat
to international order, the US tries to justify it by portraying
China\'s negative side to the international system. The securitization
theory doesn\'t rule out the possibility of conflict or cooperation;
rather, it presumes that both scenarios are possible. Further
ecuritization of issues like economic, political, technological, and
cultural relations through the prism of security may worsen the
situation (Holbraad & Pedersen,
[2012](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Holbraad)).
Problem Statement The Securitization of bilateral relations is perceived
as nontraditional security issues. As China\'s economic and military
power continues to rise, the United States has increasingly viewed China
as a strategic competitor and a potential threat to its national
security interests. To address these concerns, [the US has adopted a
policy of securitizing its bilateral relations with China, framing them
in terms of national security and treating them as a potential source of
conflict. However, this approach has been met with criticism from some
who argue that it could lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy of conflict
and undermine important economic and diplomatic ties]{.underline}
between the two countries. Therefore, the study will thoroughly explore
the effectiveness and potential consequences of the US securitizing its
bilateral relations with China, and examine alternative approaches to
managing this complex relationship that balance national security
concerns with the need for economic and diplomatic cooperation. This
study will also give a detailed understanding of the process of
Securitization and what would be the consequences of labeling something
as an existential threat. Furthermore, it provides an overall analysis
of the different issues in bilateral relations and to some extent try to
give solutions for diffusing a possible confrontation.

#### Their rhetoric over-securitizes the Arctic, making militarized conflict inevitable and preventing cooperation over non-military existential threats.

competition too much leads the Arctic on a trajectory toward becoming a
securitized region]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Yet]{.underline}, [it doesn't
have to be this way]{.underline}. [This trend can]{.underline} --- [and
should]{.underline} --- [be reversed to mitigate possible
consequences]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline}: [[Focusing on how
cooperation can be used to solve key issues in the Arctic rather than
thinking solely about military buildup]{.underline}; [changing the
framing of the Arctic in official
policie]{.underline}]{.mark}[s]{.underline}, [speeches]{.underline},
[and critical international organizations]{.underline}, such as the
Arctic Council, [and finding low-stakes issues to encourage
relationship-building]{.underline} among actors in the Arctic. So, can
the Arctic be spared from securitization? EARLY SYMPTOMS OF
SECURITIZATION [[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} is the process of
something becoming a security threat or a security issue. It [[happens
when something]{.underline}]{.mark} --- such as immigration --- [[is
labeled as]{.mark} dangerous]{.underline}, [threatening]{.underline},
[and as [an existential crisis]{.mark} by someone]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} then [that framing is accepted by an
audience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, securitization implies that
security issues are not just out there. Instead, [[by creating security
threats in the way we speak]{.underline}, [we create security
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the Arctic might seem like a
peripheral region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to
rise in importance. [[Concerns about China]{.underline},]{.mark}
[Russia]{.underline}, [[and resource competition are causing real
changes to occur in]{.mark} how states treat [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has
announced the establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be
housed within the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique
challenges and security concerns related to the Arctic region." As
climate change has resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access to
resources in the Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United
States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden
--- and non-Arctic states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a
few --- have grown. The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of
oil, gas, and minerals that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states. A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as China, are finding investment
opportunities with Arctic states to build infrastructure as part of the
Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt and Road Initiative), [[it is by no
means a necessity to treat Chinese influence as inherently
negative]{.underline}]{.mark}. By the same logic, [Russian investment
and military actions in the Arctic might seem overtly
negative]{.underline}, [but it is important to contextualize Russian
interest in the Arctic as not recent]{.underline}, [but
historic]{.underline}. [[Instead]{.underline},]{.mark} [[the rhetoric
around these issues has treated them as critical security
risks]{.underline}, [painting the Arctic as the next theater of a new
Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}. But is the Arctic really the next
theater? [Rather than focusing on these interstate threats]{.underline},
[[there are more serious concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as
climate change]{.mark} and]{.underline} insecurities that stem from it
--- such as [food]{.underline}, [water]{.underline},
[environmental]{.underline}, [and health security concerns]{.underline}
--- [that affect individuals and impact their quality of
life]{.underline}. For example, Alaskan [communities are suffering from
food insecurity]{.underline} because sea ice is melting, causing
traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise hunt, to move
elsewhere [and]{.underline} decreasing their protection from the large
ocean waves that have in some cases caused [devastating infrastructure
damage]{.underline}. On Little Diomede Island, for example, a late storm
caused serious damage to a water treatment plant, leaving the town
without clean water and without power. [[By
over-emphasizing]{.underline} "[hard]{.underline}" [security
issues]{.underline} [from]{.underline} ]{.mark}[Russia and
[China]{.mark},]{.underline} therefore, [[the rhetoric]{.mark}
surrounding Arctic politics [ignores]{.mark} other important [questions
that impact people on the ground]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly
Indigenous people whose livelihoods and societal resilience are
threatened by climate change]{.underline}. [The most significant
concern]{.underline} when it comes to treating the Arctic as a theater
of great power competition [is the danger]{.underline} it presents [in
putting the Arctic on a trajectory of becoming a securitized
region]{.underline}. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} it can be argued that
as it stands, [[the Arctic is not]{.mark} a contested region or a region
[fraught with wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the Middle East and
parts of Africa, [[it could be if the trajectory]{.mark} of treating the
Arctic as this region of competition and security
[continues]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Regions]{.mark} of the world [do not
become theaters of competition]{.mark} and conflict
[overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[become that way [after]{.mark} years of [construction]{.mark} that
involves a range of activities from rhetoric and to military
buildups]{.underline}. [Crimea is a telling example of
this]{.underline}, [where both Ukraine and Russia slowly began
ratcheting up bellicose discourse over time which was followed by
militarization]{.underline}. Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension
between the two states. [The Arctic]{.underline}, however, [is
not]{.underline} --- [and should not]{.underline} --- [be destined for
that end state]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}, the journalists who
report on our news, and the policymakers who create reports, [have a
choice in how we frame issues]{.underline}. [Rather than always treating
the Arctic as a place where competition is inherent]{.underline}, [we
can instead see it as a place of possible cooperation]{.underline}.
After all, [the largest security threat in the Arctic is climate
change]{.underline}. [It impacts not only the people living in the
Arctic itself]{.underline}, [but also]{.underline} states surrounding
the Arctic, and the rest of [the world]{.underline}, [as sea and ocean
levels increase]{.underline}, [oceans become desalinated]{.underline},
[and temperatures increase worldwide]{.underline}. [There is a choice to
focus on how states can and have been cooperating on this
issue]{.underline}, [thereby incentivizing further collaboration down
the line instead of thinking solely on old-school ways of thinking about
security]{.underline}. HOW TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY [While
we can think and write about geopolitical hard security issues in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [we can do so in a way that also gives airtime to
cooperation and collaboration rather than thinking solely about the
latest Russian military exercise or most recent scare about Chinese
investment in Greenland]{.underline}. [[This is not to say that
reporting on]{.mark} Russia and [China is not important]{.mark} or
necessary]{.underline}, [[but rather]{.underline}, [reporting in a
balanced way]{.underline}]{.mark} [that takes the responsibility of
reporting all sides of an issue seriously]{.underline}. On a policy
level, [[policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and diplomats
[[can]{.underline} --- [and should]{.underline} --- [change the framing
of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [in official policies]{.underline},
[speeches]{.underline}, [and critical international
organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic Council. [Security
shouldn't be only about the]{.underline} construction of new ships,
submarines, and [military]{.underline} exercises. [Planners who are
thinking about the role of militaries and institutions should consider
how security also refers to]{.underline} the [individual]{.underline}
security of Arctic residents, focusing on their ability to access food
[and]{.underline} water, potential insecurities arising from coastal
erosion --- 70% of which in the Arctic is built on currently thawing
permafrost --- as well as [societal insecurities]{.underline} that come
about from a lack of community resilience. Lastly, [there is a
tendency]{.underline} in international politics [to focus on conflictual
issues when instead we should be finding other]{.underline}, [more
cooperative issues to encourage relationship-building among actors in
the Arctic]{.underline}. [Instead of immediately pivoting to trying to
negotiate arms control treaties amongst Arctic states]{.underline},
[countries could instead find issues]{.underline}, [such as
transparency]{.underline}, [s]{.underline}earch [a]{.underline}nd
[r]{.underline}escue [cooperation]{.underline}, [and pollution clean-up
that does not require as much political capital]{.underline}.
[[These]{.mark} issues [might be framed as low-stakes but they should
not be]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly if all stakeholders want [[to
ensure that the Arctic is not securitized]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[RHETORIC MATTERS]{.underline} AFTER ALL [[It matters how we talk about
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Whaling is a great example of where
changing rhetoric has impacted policy]{.underline}. While in the first
half of the 20th century, whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect
of the economy, [anti-whaling discourse changed the depiction of
whales]{.underline} to intelligent mammals. [This transformed the
perception of whaling to morally repugnant]{.underline}. It goes to show
that [[the way we talk matters]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and it can matter
[more than material interests]{.mark} that might seem more
logical]{.underline}. [We can continue to use [bellicose
rhetoric]{.mark} to describe relations between states and [encourage
militarization]{.mark} on every side]{.underline}, [but [that will
end]{.mark} exactly [the way worse-case scenarios describe
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [[we]{.mark}
can]{.underline} --- [and [should]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[change the
way we talk and think about the Arctic]{.mark} [to focus on
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [change the way we frame the
region]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} find low-stakes issues on which to
cooperate and]{.underline} hopefully [[reverse or]{.mark} at least [slow
the trajectory of securitizing the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Our alternative is Relational Theory - focusing on how China develops economic relationships as an alternative to a zero sum politics. Realism attempts to divide China from the Arctic by portraying its economic interests as a threat.

Studies, Identity and Relationship-Building in China's Arctic Diplomacy,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/identity-relationship-building-china-arctic-diplomacy/\]

[Faced with both a considerable degree of international scrutiny and a
sensitivity to being viewed as an illegitimate Arctic actor, Beijing has
undertaken a multifaceted approach to developing its Arctic diplomacy,
which has included a heavy focus on regional scientific
cooperation]{.underline},12) [economic engagement, and
institution-building]{.underline} via bilateral and multilateral
engagement as well as using both governmental and 'Track II'
(sub-governmental) organisations. [This protean, 'all-around'
approach,]{.underline} which [has focused specifically on relationship
building and strengthening]{.underline}, has provided China the
opportunity to both deepen its diplomatic footprint in the region and
accumulate necessary information on the subjects of regional politics,
governance, development, and security perceptions while, until recently,
avoiding a blowback situation from Arctic governments. Relationships
matter [A recent addition to international relations (IR) studies in
China has been in the field of relational theory, which seeks to
understand the importance of, and the potential power derived by, select
relationships in the international system]{.underline} using Chinese
historical and philosophical traditions.13) [As this theory explains,
global actors exist within a network of relationships which could and
should be studied specifically along with the processes they
create]{.underline}. These interactions, [relational theory]{.underline}
suggests, [can also create and shape power in the information
system]{.underline}, including through the development of prestige or
'face' (mianzi面子) amongst various actors. [Unlike Western materialist
approaches to IR theory, including various schools of realism and
liberalism, relational theory tends to focus less on the actors
themselves, with a preference for examinations of the linkages they
produce. This approach is useful in understanding how Beijing has been
able to develop both its Arctic interests and a distinct Arctic
identity]{.underline} despite the challenges posed by both geography and
history. On one level, [China has sought to develop bilateral Arctic
partnerships with regional governments over the past
decade]{.underline}, although its success rate has been mixed at best
when looking at each of the eight Arctic states. By far the strongest of
these ties has been with Russia, as [the Ice Silk Road slowly but
steadily develops based on energy partnerships]{.underline}14) and the
promise of future infrastructure projects. Beijing has also developed
strong relations with Finland and Iceland in recent years, with the
latter country signing a free trade agreement with China in 2013. Free
trade talks are also, sporadically, underway15) between China and Norway
after a six-year diplomatic freeze ended in December 2016. China's
bilateral Arctic ties are less evident in the cases of Canada and
Sweden. [Chinese relations with Ottawa deteriorated in late 2018 after
Canadian authorities arrested a senior executive with the Chinese
telecommunications firm Huawei at the behest of the United
States,]{.underline} and Sino-Swedish ties have become brittle16) over
human rights policies and the recent Chinese sentencing of a Hong
Kong-based Swedish bookseller. Chinese relations with Denmark have also
faced headwinds over the past few years, due to Danish concerns about
Chinese interests in pursuing investments in Greenland, developments
which Copenhagen is beginning to view as representing a potential
security risk. Finally, as previously noted, the Arctic is one of the
many areas where US-China relations have frequently clashed of late.
However, to understand the current state of Chinese diplomacy in the
Arctic, an examination of Beijing's multilateral diplomacy in the region
is essential and provides much additional insight into the country's
effective use of relationship building. For example, China has sought to
be an active participant in the Arctic Council despite its limiting
observer status, or as one academic paper from the Ocean University in
Qingdao colourfully phrased it, 'dancing in shackles'.18) China's most
recent activity report to the Council, covering 2016-8, noted that
Chinese representatives were active in several of the organisation's
Working Groups, including those overseeing climate change monitoring and
marine environmental protection.19) [Despite ongoing US government
criticism of China's alleged challenge to the 'rules-based order' of the
Arctic, Beijing has sought to support governance regimes relevant to the
Arctic, i]{.underline}ncluding older agreements such as the Spitsbergen
Treaty, (which China joined in 1925),20) and the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 21) As China's 2018 Arctic
White Paper indicated, the country would 'participate in regulating and
managing the affairs and activities relating to the Arctic on the basis
of rules and mechanisms'. China was also active in the drawing up and
implementation of two more contemporary regional agreements,
specifically the 2017 Polar Code,22) via the International Maritime
Organisation, and the 2018 ban on unregulated high seas fishing in the
Central Arctic Ocean. Beijing's support for the fishing moratorium, as
one commentary argued,23) served to underscore Chinese support for a
strong legal framework in the Arctic while also allowing China greater
visibility in emerging regional legal debates, despite the country's
limitations within the Arctic Council. China, like many other non-Arctic
states with broadening concerns in the far north, has also engaged
extensively with Track II mechanisms both as a means for further
information collection and as a means to further deepen relations with
sub- and non-governmental actors. Chinese governmental, scientific and
academic representatives have been frequent participants in Arctic
Circle (Reykjavík) and Arctic Frontiers (Tromsø) conferences, as well as
within the Russia-sponsored Arctic: Territory of Dialogue events.
Shanghai hosted an Arctic Circle breakout forum in May last year, which
provided China with further opportunities to demonstrate its research
and business prowess in the region. In an announcement last year,
Beijing also sought to develop its own Track II conferences via the
China-Nordic Arctic Research Centre (CNARC) created in 2013, as well as
via a similar forum, which reportedly will connect Chinese and Russian
scientific expertise. China as an Arctic pathfinder Although Beijing's
Arctic diplomacy remains a work in progress and may be facing stronger
resistance from the United States, and other Western governments in the
near future, some initial conclusions can be drawn from China's early
patterns of Arctic engagement. First, [although China is accepting, at
present, of its subaltern status within the Arctic Council, the country
has been actively seeking to deepen its polar diplomacy through
alternative avenues, and the development of multifaceted relationships
with significant regional actors is essential to achieve
th]{.underline}is. Second, China's relational diplomacy is also having
the effect of bringing forward the question of defining an Arctic
stakeholder, even among states with no Arctic geography. Third, the Ice
Silk Road may still be in its infancy, but its slow and steady
development may serve as the central platform for further Chinese
integration, especially relating to economic diplomacy in the region.
Fourth, [should the United States continue to pursue a zero-sum,
'security first' approach to its Arctic strategy]{.underline}, the
relationships Beijing has begun to build may be essential in a scenario,
which [Beijing is duly concerned about, involving a more overt 'cutting
up' of the region amongst the Arctic powers,]{.underline} with no
significant role for outside actors.24) Finally, the Arctic is proving
to be a critical acid test of Chinese international relations beyond the
familiar frontiers of the Asia-Pacific, and in addition to the need for
greater understanding of the players within the region, China is also
seeking to comprehend the political relationships amongst them, and how
they can also be key components of Beijing's emerging diplomacy in the
circumpolar north.

#### The Rhetoric of policy makers can shape public opinion - if we label China as a threat, then our public is motivated to believe it is one.

**Ahmad, 2023 - Student Thesis from the University of Management and
Technology in Pakistan** \[Fahad, June 2023, researchgate
"Securitization of US-CHINA Relations: A Catalyst for Confrontation,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377650144_Securitization_of_US-CHINA_Relations_A_Catalyst_for_Confrontation"\]

[Although there were concerns about the rise of China and the threat it
posed to U.S\'s national security and the security of the world, but
Securitization is a different phenomenon. According to this theory when
you label something as a security issue, your interaction towards that
particular object changes]{.underline}, the change may be positive or
negative, but it definitely changes the issue from being a political one
to a security one. The same thing happened in the context of US-China
relations during the Trump administration. During his administration the
United States started to view every aspect of the bilateral relationship
(Political, economic, military and cultural) through the prism of
security and considered China as a National Security threat in all these
areas. [President Trump]{.underline} in a remark said \"I view China in
many different ways but right now, I am thinking about trade, but, you
know, trade equals military\". This statement by the U.S president shows
that he started to view non-traditional security issues through the
prism of security. He [believed the economic rise of China would bring
about militarization of China and it would be a threat to the U.S
security. The U.S politicians and policy makers were just trying to
present a negative image of China and the threat it posed to the
national security of America specifically, and to the security of the
world in general.]{.underline} \"China is a threat to the world in a
sense because they are building a military faster than anybody and
frankly, they are using US money,\" remarked by Trump (Sempa,
[2022](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Sempa)).
These remarks by the U.S politicians and policymakers were an effort to
lay the groundwork for taking action against China and to preserve US
dominance in the world by containing the rise of China, it was a sort of
speech act. During the 75th annual U.N. General Assembly meeting, mostly
held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, Sept. 22, 2020.
The U.S President blamed China for the outbreak of Covid-19 and even
called it the \"Chinese Virus\". This was also an attempt to downgrade
China\'s global image. [By regularly demonizing China and the Chinese
Communist Party as a biggest threat to the U.S security and prosperity,
U.S politicians even shaped the public opinion in support of the China
threat theory. According to PEW research institute, over the past few
years from 2018 onwards, the perception of China as a partner has
decreased significantly and now majority of the people see China as a
competitor or at worse an enemy.]{.underline} The reason they hated
China are many but most American cited the human right issues and
economy. Although these are the prominent issues but underline this
change of perceptions is the state desire to contain China and maintain
the status quo, a U.S lead world order (Turcsayi &
Qiaoan, [2020](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Turcsanyi)).

### \--Extend - China Links

#### China's attempt to involve itself in Arctic economic affairs leads to it being characterized as a threat because it not an Arctic state.

**Lanteigne, 2020 -- Associate Professor, Arctic University of Norway**
\[Mark, April 28, The Arctic Institute, Center for Circumpolar Security
Studies, Identity and Relationship-Building in China's Arctic Diplomacy,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/identity-relationship-building-china-arctic-diplomacy/\]

The need to create an acceptable Arctic identity was arguably most
pressing for China, given its status as a great power and [early
concerns expressed by]{.underline} other actors, particularly [the
United States, that Beijing was seeking a revisionist agenda in the
region, especially at a time when the Arctic was seen as a resource
bonanza-in-waiting.]{.underline}4) [Increasing concerns was the timing
of China's admittance as a Council observer, which coincided with rising
tensions between Beijing and Washington over the South China Sea, as
critics often attempted to loop together that waterway and the Arctic
Ocean as simply facets of the same policy of Chinese strategic
assertiveness.]{.underline} While the acceptance of China as an observer
could considered a validation of the country's emerging Arctic
interests, at the same time it placed Beijing under a metaphorical
microscope, prompting the Chinese government to adopt a conservative
approach to regional diplomacy. Navigating as a 'near-Arctic state'
Central to the success of China's emerging Arctic policies was the need
to be accepted as a legitimate stakeholder in the region without being
viewed as pursuing a dissenting agenda and risking being marginalised in
a region which Beijing had recognised as one of emerging strategic
importance. Therefore, China was required to build a robust Arctic
identity over the past decade, and despite more overt pushbacks from the
United States since last year, Beijing has been largely successful in
achieving this goal. To understand why, it is necessary to look closely
at the building blocks of the country's current Arctic identity,
especially since Beijing was able to develop key bilateral and
multilateral relationships in the region to fortify the perception of it
becoming an indispensable partner in the development of the Arctic. [One
example of the difficulties Beijing faced in developing its Arctic
identity was the negative reaction in some international policymaking
circles towards China's self-identification, s]{.underline}tarting
almost a decade ago, [as a 'near-Arctic state']{.underline} (jin beiji
guojia近北极国家). [From a geographic viewpoint, the label made little
sense. China has no territory in]{.underline} or near the
[Arctic]{.underline}; the county of Mohe (漠河县), which despite being
the northernmost point in the country and renowned for its sub-zero
winters, is located over 1400 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle.
Nonetheless, the use of the term began to appear in both Chinese policy
statements and research commentaries shortly before China achieved
Arctic Council observer status, and then was a feature in the country's
six-point statement6) on the Arctic produced in 2015, and within China's
first government White Paper on Arctic policy,7) released three years
later, which also confirmed that the Arctic was to be linked with
Beijing's greater 'Belt and Road' trade and infrastructure strategies.
The 'near-Arctic' concept was also explained in an official Blue Book on
Chinese Arctic affairs, published in 2018, which suggested that in
addition to China's relative proximity to the Arctic, the country's
economic weight, and the connections between Arctic climate change and
its changed weather and pollution conditions within China,9) were also
components of that descriptor. [However, the term has at times been
denigrated outside of China, including last year by the US
government,]{.underline}10) [for implying that Beijing was seeking to
challenge the sovereignty of Arctic states and
institutions.]{.underline} China has been actively seeking to dispel
such concerns, given that much of its Arctic policy is heavily dependent
upon the goodwill of the Arctic states themselves, especially Russia,
which is the centrepiece for future development of an 'Ice Silk Road'
(Bingshang Sichouzhilu 冰上丝绸之路), which would connect China to
markets in Northern Europe, and potentially elsewhere in the Arctic
Ocean, via the Russian Arctic.11)

#### Western perceptions of China will influence how we see them in the Arctic - we will label them as a threat, which can escalate to miscalculation

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

[There are concerns about China's Arctic strategy internationally, and
it is often perceived alongside Russian militarization of the Arctic as
a dual threat to the established international order]{.underline}. [In a
recent report, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) names China as a
threat to American interests in the Arctic, labeling it---together with
Russia--- a challenge "to the rules-based international order around the
globe]{.underline} \[causing\] concern of similar infringement to the
continued peaceful stability of the Arctic region", drawing parallels to
Chinese conduct in the South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea
(ECS).2[) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently stated
that the Arctic has "become an arena of global power and competition",
drawing similar parallels to China's actions in its regional waters:
"China's pattern of aggressive behavior elsewhere will inform how it
treats the Arctic".3) The United States recently published its updated
Arctic policy, building on these points and stating that China and
Russia "are \[...\] pursuing activities and capabilities in the Arctic
that may present risks to the homeland",]{.underline} and that these
risks may constrain the United States Department of Defense's "ability
to flow forces globally, and more broadly to affect U.S. strategic
objectives related to competition with China and Russia in the
Indo-Pacific and Europe", going so far as to state that [PRC and Russia
causes the Arctic to be "vulnerable to 'strategic spillover' from
tensions, competition, or conflict arising in \[...\] other
regions."]{.underline}4) Furthermore[, Japan]{.underline} -- a permanent
observer member of the Arctic Council, the principal multilateral forum
for Arctic governance -- [has similarly identified China as a threat to
the rules-based order governing the Arctic]{.underline}.5) Arctic
nations such as Denmark,6) Sweden7) and Norway8) have supported the US
position or singled China out unilaterally as a potential threat in the
Arctic[.]{.underline} Despite Russia being a potential strategic partner
for China in the Arctic, it is reportedly another one of the Arctic
countries expressing concern about Chinese military buildup in the
region.9) [In a recent white paper, an analyst from USEUCOM Strategy
Division & Russia Strategic Initiative states that mutual Sino-Russian
scepticism in the Arctic can, and should, be used by the United States
to "counter what appears to be a growing alignment of Chinese and
Russian strategic interests".]{.underline}10)

### \--Extend - China Implications

#### Discussing China as an existential threat is a racist method to generate domestic support for policies targeting them - no evidence supports the argument that China represents an existential threat.

**Ahmad, 2023 - Student Thesis from the University of Management and
Technology in Pakistan** \[Fahad, June 2023, researchgate
"Securitization of US-CHINA Relations: A Catalyst for Confrontation,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377650144_Securitization_of_US-CHINA_Relations_A_Catalyst_for_Confrontation"\]

The United States has to objectively assess the situation to determine
whether China is an existential threat to its survival and act
accordingly. Few researchers and scholars now believe that China
doesn\'t pose an existential threat to either the existence of the
United States or the security of the international system. In an article
published in Foreign Policy, Micheal D. Swaine argues that [China does
not pose an existential threat to the United
States ]{.underline}(Swaine, [2021](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Swaine)).
Politicians, military officers, and pundits take turns to highlight this
issue but according to Swaine, [the threat perception is not based on
empirical data.]{.underline} Wong and Myers
([2020](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Wong)),
under the title \"Officials Push US-China Relations toward Point of No
Return\" asserted [that US government officials use rhetoric and
criticism against China to get support in domestic
elections,]{.underline} according to the other it was President Trump
Policies that started a fundamental strategic and ideological
confrontation between the two major powers. [According to Li
([2021](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Li)),
a famous Chinese western educated scholar]{.underline}, [China is the
only country in history which gained such huge amount of power without
firing a single bullet or invading another country, so he doesn\'t see
China\'s rise as an existential threat to the US]{.underline} (Shah,
[2023](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Shah)).
While the majority of research is concerned with the causes of
confrontation and the possibility of conflict, no organized piece of
work has been done on [the process of Securitization, the process
through which threats are being created through discourse so that
extraordinary measures against that threat can be
justified.]{.underline} [As China being an existential threat to the US
and international order cannot be justified by empirical evidence,
actors like government officials, politicians, and pundits try to frame
it as such to divert resources, attention, and focus toward that
specified threat.]{.underline} The Securitization theory doesn\'t rule
out the possibility of conflict or cooperation, rather it presumes that
both scenarios are possible. [Further Securitization of the issue like
seeing economic, political, technological, and cultural relations
through the prism of security may exacerbate the already tense
situation]{.underline} (Song,
[2015](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Song)).
The American perception of China as an existential threat is not only
based on China\'s rise but also on a long history of animosity and
distrust against Asians. In his book \"Has China Won\"
[Mahbubani]{.underline}
([2020](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Mahbubani))
[argues that the animosity against the Asian nation is rooted in 'Yellow
Peril\' a racist metaphor that regards East Asians as an existential
threat to Western world.]{.underline} In \"The Myth of American
Exceptionalism\" Hodgson
([2009](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Hodgson))
argues that [Americans believe that their political, economic, and moral
values are superior to all other nations; therefore, they should be
considered universal and admired by all. This sense of exceptionalism is
wrong and is a barrier to understanding issues through
reason]{.underline}. In a nutshell, [looking at the relationship through
a zero-sum game and a cold war mentality will further worsen the
situation; therefore, a process of de-securitization is
required]{.underline} in areas where there is a possibility of
cooperation like trade, climate change, terrorism, and nuclear
nonproliferation.

### \--AT China Threat Real

#### Labelling China as an existential threat actually makes them Into a threat - China does not pose a threat now

**Ahmad, 2023 - Student Thesis from the University of Management and
Technology in Pakistan** \[Fahad, June 2023, researchgate
"Securitization of US-CHINA Relations: A Catalyst for Confrontation,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377650144_Securitization_of_US-CHINA_Relations_A_Catalyst_for_Confrontation"\]

Ole Weaver, a major contributor to this school of thought, asserted that
[security is a self-referential activity]{.underline}, [emphasizing that
labeling something as a security issue makes it one]{.underline}
(Balzacq,
[2011](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Balzacq2011)).
According to him, Securitization theory consists of a few major and
inter related concepts. [A Securitizing Agent is an actor who has the
capability and power to frame something as a security
threat]{.underline}. A Referent Object is something that needs to be
protected, and faces an existential threat from any other entity, and
the most important element in securitization theory is the relevant
Audience (Floyd,
[2011](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Floyd2011)).
[Central to the securitization theory is showing the Rhetorical
Structure of decision-makers when framing an issue and attempting to
lift the issue above politics]{.underline}. [This is what Securitization
theorists call a Speech Act, issues are constructed as security threats
by political or other actors through rhetoric to convince the relevant
audience and to justify emergency measures.]{.underline} According to
Swaine
([2021](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Swaine)),
it has become a cottage industry in Washington and in parts of Europe
these days to highlight the ways in which China threatens the U.S,
Western and Asian interests, politicians, military officers, and
pundits. Take turns describing the dangers posed by Beijing\'s
expansionist and aggressive military, implacably hostile ideology,
predatory economic and tech policies, and insidious overseas operations.
S President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken still depict
China as a major challenge to the entire 'rule-based order\' and a
threat to the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism which is
now, according to Biden, at an \"infection point\" (Swaine,
[2021](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Swaine)).
[Politicians and officials in the US contend that China is attempting to
weaken US positions on these matters and seeks to replace them with
their fictitious objectives. These circumstances may not constitute an
existential danger to the United States, but U.S. politicians and
officials depict them as such]{.underline} in order to secure
partnerships with China in these sectors and justify extreme steps to
restrain China\'s ascent (Balzacq,
[2019](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Balzacq2019)).
There is no conventional threat to the continental United States today.
This clearly shows that [this presentation of China as an existential
threat is mainly concerned with threat construction and
securitization.]{.underline} Emma Ashford an adjunct assistant professor
at George Town University says that the last time the United States did
such securitization of an issue was before the start of the war on
terror which led to the disastrous Afghan war which continued for almost
20 years with significant damage to the U.S (Floyd & Croft,
[2011](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#FloydCroft2011)).
[Securitization theory]{.underline} does not assume that security issues
are based on empirical evidence, rather it [sees the importance of
securitizing actors in presenting something as a threat]{.underline} to
the relevant audience and [a successful securitization means the
audience will acknowledge the presence of an existential threat to the
existence of a referent objec]{.underline}t. The referent object should
also be something significant that the audience believes requires
protection such as, the existence of the state, freedom, economic
independence, etc.
(Williams, [2010](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/gsr/article/download/4479/2181?inline=1#Williams)).

#### China does not pose a threat to the US, but labeling their economic actions as zero sum will escalate conflicts and prevent cooperation.

**Ahmad, 2023 - Student Thesis from the University of Management and
Technology in Pakistan** \[Fahad, June 2023, researchgate
"Securitization of US-CHINA Relations: A Catalyst for Confrontation,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377650144_Securitization_of_US-CHINA_Relations_A_Catalyst_for_Confrontation"\]

[Contrary to prevailing narratives, an objective analysis demonstrates
that China does not pose an existential threat to the United States or
its allies. While concerns have emerged from China\'s economic rise and
certain political actions, it is imperative to recognize the
disproportionate emphasis on the notion of a threat.]{.underline} In
terms of military might, the United States maintains a substantial
advantage over China, ensuring a balance of power. Economically, the
United States remains the preeminent global force. [The growth of
China\'s economy does not inherently undermine the United States;
rather, it contributes to the complex interdependence of the global
economy. Viewing China\'s rise as a zero-sum game oversimplifies the
intricate dynamics of a globalized world.]{.underline} [Politicians
often exhibit a tendency to inflate perceived threats, leading to an
exaggeration of China\'s role on the international stage.]{.underline}
The historical oscillation in the United States\' perspective towards
China, from ideological hostility during the Cold War to strategic
partnership and now a renewed sense of hostility, highlights the
political dynamics shaping the narrative. While concerns exist regarding
China\'s intentions, it is crucial to critically assess claims that
paint China as an existential threat. The narrative of China\'s
dominance rests on rhetorical foundations rather than factual evidence.
[The securitization of the United States-China relationship has
transformed public discourse and policymaking, expanding the scope of
security to encompass economic]{.underline}, technological, and cultural
[dimensions.]{.underline} This paradigm shift has contributed to a
widespread perception of China as a significant national security
threat, even among the public. [Such an approach has the potential to
amplify tensions]{.underline} and distort the understanding of the true
nature of the bilateral relationship. Policymakers must adopt a balanced
and nuanced perspective that considers the multifaceted nature of global
interactions. In conclusion, a comprehensive examination of the United
States-China bilateral relationship reveals the multifaceted dynamics at
play. While engagement has yielded substantial benefits, [concerns about
China\'s rise have at times been exaggerated]{.underline}. [The
discourse surrounding China\'s threat, shaped by political rhetoric and
securitization, warrants careful consideration]{.underline}. To ensure a
stable and productive bilateral relationship, both countries\' leaders
and policymakers need to navigate these complexities with a balanced
approach that prioritizes cooperation and understanding over fear and
misperception. Recommendations This study cannot deny the fact that the
world is changing in terms global powers, therefore, the new powers are
centralized, especially on the economic aspect shifting towards Asian
region, in which China and India have become two big powers. Both the
countries have enormous potential in terms of economic development and
innovation. Therefore, a normal political relationship between the two
countries is very important for its stability and prosperity. [The
United States must look at the economic,]{.underline} technological and
other types of [relationships between the two countries through the lens
of normal political and diplomatic issue not something as threatening to
the U.S national security and the world order.]{.underline} The two
countries must devise a comprehensive strategy for resolving bilateral
and international issues through negotiations and compromises. However,
[U.S should not react furiously with these situations and making policy
blunders]{.underline}, the U.S should carefully weigh the threat posed
by cutting edge Chinese technologies like 5G, it should not over react
by banning the Chinese telecommunication companies all at once this will
have a negative effect not only on China but also on the United Stated
businesses because China is still significantly depended upon American
parts for its manufacturing base.

#### Chinese motives in the Arctic are defensive - they have military plans to defend their interests, but prefer to use institutions to keep peace

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

2015 National Security Law [China's 2015 National Security Law
explicitly references exploration of the Arctic. This is one of the
earliest mentions of the Arctic in a security context]{.underline} from
the Chinese government. Article 32 of the law presents arguments similar
to those laid out in the white paper on Arctic policy, of the right to
exploration and use of the Arctic.30) Research conducted by the
now-defunct State Oceanic Administration (SOA)31) is one way of shedding
light on Chinese strategic thinking on the Arctic in connection with the
National Security Law. SOA's functions, supervising work connected to
China's maritime rights, research and environmental protection,32) are
now placed under the new Ministry of Natural Resources, which has the
responsibility for the development and protection. The First Institute
of Oceanography, under the auspices of SOA, posited in a 2018 paper, for
example, [that]{.underline} the 2015 National Security [Law "expounds
China's interests in new territories like the Arctic areas", including
"geostrategy and military security, asset and personnel security,
climate and environment security and resource- and energy
security".]{.underline}33) The paper proposes the deployment of Chinese
military forces to protect its interests in the Arctic, specifically to
protect Chinese ships passing through the region and to safeguard
construction projects connected to the Polar Silk Road. [The authors
view the Arctic as a region which could potentially become an arena for
a "new Cold War" between NATO countries and Russia, which may hinder the
development of China's economic interests in the area.]{.underline} The
analysis presented underscores the argument that China has identified
areas of interest in the Arctic that it aims to protect, with military
means if necessary. However, [China sees peace and stability as key
requirements for the successful development of its commercial interests,
as indicated in its official Arctic policy, where China states that it
wants to play an active role in Arctic governance and the shaping of
rules and norms in the region, with the end goal of maintaining
peace]{.underline} and security.34) [Avoiding conflicts in the region
can thus be seen as the principal motivation for China's involvement in
Arctic governance.]{.underline} The acknowledgement of the potential for
conflict in the region precipitates the need for increased Chinese
military capacity in the Arctic. PLA Strategy and Capacity Building
China's military has invested resources in studying the military
importance of the Arctic, resulting in numerous publications. One
military scholar sums up the security priorities of China in the Arctic,
stating that, "[the military has made knowledge accumulation and
institutional improvement for the Arctic governance" a priority.35)
Knowledge accumulation is presented as the key to strengthening China's
capacity to safeguard its interests in building up dual
military-civilian capacities on navigation and meteorology for the
Arctic.]{.underline} For example, the state-owned China General Nuclear
Power Group just completed their bidding process for the construction of
a nuclear-powered ice-breaker, which will be China's first
nuclear-powered surface vessel if completed.36)

#### China prefers to view the Arctic peacefully - their desire to defend their commercial interests does not mean militarization

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

[China has previously shown an inclination towards aligning itself with
the US on Arctic issues, sharing the goal of open trade routes in the
region and harboring similar concerns about the militarization of the
Arctic. PLA scholars noted in 2016 that there were two main "camps" in
the future of the Arctic, namely Russia and the US.46) They speculated
that China was more likely to align with the US on Arctic issues due to
skepticism towards Russian militarization in the Arctic and optimism
towards the US stance on open access to shipping routes through the
region.]{.underline} [Public statements from the US, however, indicates
a lack of interest in commercial opportunities in the Arctic, reducing
the scope for commercial cooperation with China.47) The same paper
argued that China can, and should, play a part in the ongoing
international resource grab in the Arctic]{.underline}. The paper,
written by researchers from five PLA entities, and a meteorological lab
under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Education, concludes that
"countries around the world are grabbing the Arctic resources through
alliances, domestic legislation and military exercises. China should,
and can, play a part". The paper especially views the increasing
scientific consensus about the coming availability of hydrocarbons as
the Arctic ice melts: "the dependence of the world's economic growth on
energy, especially on oil and gas, has made military and political
leaders in [many countries aware of the need to formulate political
relations about the Arctic as soon as possible and to coordinate all
important areas from the North Pole, scientific research in the waters,
peaceful use of the Arctic Ocean and to carry out large-scale military
operations and (...) to promote national interests in the Arctic
region." The paper highlights dangers surrounding the militarization of
the Arctic, noting that "the pace of military training in the region is
accelerated. The Arctic may become the tipping point of new
wars."]{.underline} The identification of potential military threats to
China's interests in the Arctic indicates China's increased awareness of
the security implications of its Arctic presence, and the need to devote
resources to address them. However, [such a shift does not directly
translate into China becoming an aggressive player in the Arctic. Much
of China's naval capabilities remain tied to the South China Sea, and
China does not claim sovereignty over any parts of the
Arctic]{.underline}. Rather, the Chinese military will likely support
Beijing's trade and commercial ambitions in the region---which remains
dependent on cooperation with other countries. [Military prerogatives
thus operate in a fine balancing act alongside commercial
goals]{.underline}.

Climate scientists say the Arctic is warming four times faster than
anywhere else. This impacts ecosystems, wildlife and local populations.
The Arctic is enormous, encompassing 4% of the globe. [But global powers
see a new world of opportunities opening up in the Arctic on the back of
environmental changes.]{.underline} [The melting ice in the Arctic makes
it easier to access the region\'s incredible natural resources -

\]

Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north[, Beijing's desire for Arctic supremacy has
rapidly evolved over the past century]{.underline}. [China's
involvement]{.underline} in the Arctic [began in 1925 with the signing
of the Svalbard Treaty]{.underline}, [providing a legal basis for China
to conduct non-military activity]{.underline}, such as scientific
exploration, resource extraction, and fishing in the Arctic.^16)^
However, [China's rationale to operate in the region extends beyond
scientific exploration]{.underline}. In 2018 [China released its first
Arctic White Paper, which asserts that it is a "Near-Arctic
State."]{.underline}^17)^ [China employs a dual narrative to explain its
aims in the Arctic]{.underline}. Externally[, Beijing appeals to foreign
audiences]{.underline} [by advocating for the safeguarding of
international interests]{.underline} [and promoting sustainable Arctic
development]{.underline}. However, [this is juxtaposed against the
narrative it promotes for domestic audiences]{.underline}, [which
emphasizes competition for resources and China's desire to become a
"polar great power."]{.underline}^18)^ [The Svalbard Treaty has
currently enabled China to shroud its military activity and
influence]{.underline} in the Arctic as scientific exploration and
global cooperation. But it is becoming clear from its growing
partnership with Russia and increasingly aggressive military action in
the Arctic that [China's intentions to reshape the international system
extend well beyond the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. and NATO would be wise to
recognize China's aims in the Arctic.]{.underline}

relations]{.underline}, making it a key consideration for American
strategic planning.

### \--Extend - China is already Securitizing

#### China sees scientific progress and the Arctic Council as avenues for power - it justifies their securitization of the Arctic

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

[China's increasing focus on commercial opportunities in the Arctic15)
has grown in tandem with its efforts to contribute to the shaping of
norms and rules in the region through multilateral
forums]{.underline}.16) As indicated in its official Arctic policy,
China states that it wants to play, "a constructive part in the making,
interpretation, application and development of international rules
regarding the Arctic".17) While China has contributed to other
multilateral forums, [the Arctic Council is the principal outlet for
these efforts, where countries' scientific and academic capacities in
the Arctic play an important part]{.underline}. [Scientific output and
collaborations are what gives countries a seat at the table in Arctic
Council working groups.18) China's presence in the Arctic Council
started in 2006]{.underline}, and discussions about Chinese ascension to
Arctic Council permanent observer status coincided with a significant
increase in Chinese activity in the council.19) In China's 2016 and 2018
Arctic Council observer reports it stated that it took part in most
working groups20)21) and that it took part in every Arctic Council
meeting possible.22) [China's efforts to lead in Arctic science is
reflected in a steady increase of publications since 2006. According to
a 2016 pilot study, China was "by far the nation with the highest
relative growth (260 per-cent increase)"]{.underline} since then,
ranking 7th in terms of Arctic scientific publications.23) Statistics
from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database indicates that
this trend has continued since then (see Figure 1.). [A scientific
presence in the Arctic not only provides China with legitimate access to
the region's waters, but also the technical capabilities to map, survey
and monitor the region.26) These research activities therefore have the
potential to support both Chinese commercial and military activities in
the Arctic]{.underline}. For example, the marine research voyage of the
Chinese icebreaker, 'Xue Long', westward through the Arctic in 2017,
provided the Chinese with valuable information on the viability of
future trade through the region.27) Similarly, [the Annual U.S.
Department of Defense report to Congress regarding China argues that:
"Civilian research could support a strengthened Chinese military
presence in the Arctic Ocean,]{.underline} which could include deploying
submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks".28)
[China's increasing civilian focus on mapping, surveying, and navigation
in the Arctic Council could be seen in the same context]{.underline}.

### \--Extend - Chinese Threat Real

#### China is developing satellite surveillance technology in the Arctic - this poses a military threat

**Havnes and Seland, 2019 - Authors at The Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies** \[Heljar and Johan Martin, July 16, The
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies, "The
Increasing Security Focus in China's Arctic Policy",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/increasing-security-focus-china-arctic-policy/\]

Navigation and Satellite Technology [Research conducted by
PLA]{.underline}, both unilaterally and in cooperation with civilian
stakeholders[, indicates that Arctic navigation and satellite
surveillance technology has been identified as a priority by China's
military establishment]{.underline}. [These knowledge and
capacity-building efforts have been identified as a security threat in
the Arctic by the US in its latest Arctic policy]{.underline}.37) In
2015, researchers from PLA and the China Ship Development and Design
Center published an article on maneuverability of ships in the
region38). In 2016, The PLA University of Science and Technology
completed research on climate change and weather in the Arctic.39)
Navigation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but both Arctic
climate change and weather conditions are key elements of navigational
possibilities in the region. A joint paper by researchers from the PLA
and the National Ocean Satellite Application Center (NSOAS)40) in 2015
about ice levels, melting and the impact on ship navigation in the
Arctic concluded that global warming is decreasing ice levels to such an
extent that navigating Arctic waterways will become possible as global
temperatures rise (Shili, et al., 2015). In 2014, the PLA undertook a
joint research effort with NSOAS and Shanghai Ocean University that
confirmed that data provided by the HY-2 satellite, developed by NSOAS
in 2011, could be used for "operational sea services" in the Arctic.41)
[These research undertakings provide early signs of PLA interest in
Arctic ship navigation and the usage of military-civilian cooperation on
building up Chinese naval capacities in the Arctic. Satellite data has,
indeed, been identified as having military uses in the Arctic,
underscored by the recent warnings from The Swedish Defense Research
Agency,]{.underline} an affiliate of the Swedish Army and Ministry of
Defense, [that Chinese investments in]{.underline}, and cooperation on,
Swedish [satellite technology could have military uses in the
Arctic]{.underline}.42) The PLA has reportedly been building up its
Arctic navigational capabilities since these research projects were
undertaken.43)

#### The Link is Discourse around Economic Issues - Securitizing non-security issues creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of threats and reactions

[Securitization theory, an emerging perspective in the contemporary
international system where states view their relations with other states
through this theoretical framework. This theory explains how one state
shape a non-security issue into a security issue. The United States for
the past few years has been portraying China as an existential threat to
its vital national interest and the interests of the global community at
large. This threat perception and cold war mentality have been portrayed
at all levels and in every discourse,]{.underline} with some
intellectuals trying to link this to the 'Thucydides Trap\'. The study
uses qualitative research methodology, relying on secondary data from
different articles, book journals, interview transcripts, and other
important sources. Discourse analysis has been used to analyze secondary
data. The purpose of this paper is to understand and comprehend how this
relationship has been securitized, evolving from engagement to
confrontation. The study also seeks to determine whether such
construction of China\'s image is empirically justifiable or is merely
based on rhetoric and propaganda to contain its rise. Furthermore, it
explores how [the potential of securitization can increase the intensity
of already deteriorating relations between the US and China toward
confrontation]{.underline}. To sum up, the importance of securitization
and its impact on the dynamics between the two nations has been
thoroughly discussed.

#### Their rhetoric over-securitizes the Arctic making it an area of a "Race for Resources" - this makes militarized conflict inevitable. Race discourse shapes reality.

Whether you read US Army and Coastal Guard Strategies from other Arctic
states or the front page of the New York Times, [the Arctic is becoming
nearly synonymous with fears]{.underline} about Russia and China.
Military [strategists and journalists]{.underline} alike [write about
Russian militarization as well as unwelcome Chinese
influence]{.underline} in the High North. [While there are certainly
geopolitical realities to take into consideration [when thinking about
Arctic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in focusing too heavily on
questions of]{.underline} "[hard]{.underline}" [security]{.underline},
[[policymakers are obscuring other transnational issues]{.underline},
[such as climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} [and cyber
security]{.underline}, [where cooperation is not only desired but also
necessary]{.underline}. In other words, [[discussing interstate
competition too much leads the Arctic on a trajectory toward becoming a
securitized region]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Yet]{.underline}, [it doesn't
have to be this way]{.underline}. [This trend can]{.underline} --- [and
should]{.underline} --- [be reversed to mitigate possible
consequences]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline}: [[Focusing on how
cooperation can be used to solve key issues in the Arctic]{.mark} rather
than thinking solely about military buildup]{.underline}; [[changing the
framing of the Arctic in official policie]{.mark}s]{.underline},
[speeches]{.underline}, [and critical international
organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic Council, [and finding
low-stakes issues to encourage relationship-building]{.underline} among
actors in the Arctic. So, can the Arctic be spared from securitization?
EARLY SYMPTOMS OF SECURITIZATION [[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}
is the process of something becoming a security threat or a security
issue. It [[happens when something]{.underline}]{.mark} --- such as
immigration --- [[is labeled as]{.mark} dangerous]{.underline},
[threatening]{.underline}, [and as [an existential crisis]{.mark} by
someone]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} then [that framing is accepted by an
audience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, securitization implies that
security issues are not just out there. Instead, [by creating security
threats in the way we speak]{.underline}, [we create security
issues]{.underline}. While the Arctic might seem like a peripheral
region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to rise in
importance. [[Concerns about]{.mark} China]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline}, [[and resource competition are causing real
changes to occur in]{.mark} how states treat [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has
announced the establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be
housed within the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique
challenges and security concerns related to the Arctic region." As
climate change has resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access to
resources in the Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United
States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden
--- and non-Arctic states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a
few --- have grown. The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of
oil, gas, and minerals that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states. A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as China, are finding investment
opportunities with Arctic states to build infrastructure as part of the
Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt and Road Initiative), [it is by no
means a necessity to treat Chinese influence as inherently
negative]{.underline}. By the same logic, [Russian investment and
military actions in the Arctic might seem overtly negative]{.underline},
[but it is important to contextualize Russian interest in the Arctic as
not recent]{.underline}, [but historic]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, [the rhetoric around these issues has treated
them as critical security risks]{.underline}, [painting the Arctic as
the next theater of a new Cold War]{.underline}. But is the Arctic
really the next theater? [Rather than focusing on these interstate
threats]{.underline}, [[there are more serious
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as climate change
and]{.underline}]{.mark} insecurities that stem from it --- such as
[[food]{.underline}, [water]{.underline}, [environmental]{.underline},
[and health security concerns]{.underline} --- [that affect individuals
and impact their quality of life]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
Alaskan [[communities are suffering from food
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} because sea ice is melting, causing
traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise hunt, to move
elsewhere [and]{.underline} decreasing their protection from the large
ocean waves that have in some cases caused [devastating infrastructure
damage]{.underline}. On Little Diomede Island, for example, a late storm
caused serious damage to a water treatment plant, leaving the town
without clean water and without power. [By over-emphasizing]{.underline}
"[hard]{.underline}" [security issues]{.underline} [from Russia and
China,]{.underline} therefore, [[the rhetoric surrounding Arctic
politics ignores other important questions that impact people on the
ground]{.underline}, [particularly Indigenous people whose
livelihoods]{.underline}]{.mark} [and societal [resilience are
threatened by climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The most significant
concern]{.underline} when it comes to treating the Arctic as a theater
of great power competition [is the danger]{.underline} it presents [in
putting the Arctic on a trajectory of becoming a securitized
region]{.underline}. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} it can be argued that
as it stands, [[the Arctic is not]{.mark} a contested region or a region
[fraught with wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the Middle East and
parts of Africa, [[it could be if the trajectory of treating the Arctic
as this region of competition]{.mark} and security
[continues]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Regions]{.mark} of the world [do not
become theaters of competition]{.mark} and conflict
[overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[become that way [after]{.mark} years of [construction]{.mark} that
involves a range of activities from rhetoric and to military
buildups]{.underline}. [Crimea is a telling example of
this]{.underline}, [where both Ukraine and Russia slowly began
ratcheting up bellicose discourse over time which was followed by
militarization]{.underline}. Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension
between the two states. [The Arctic]{.underline}, however, [is
not]{.underline} --- [and should not]{.underline} --- [be destined for
that end state]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}, the journalists who
report on our news, and the policymakers who create reports, [have a
choice in how we frame issues]{.underline}. [[Rather than always
treating the Arctic as a place where competition is
inherent]{.underline}, [we can instead see it as a place of possible
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, [the largest security
threat in the Arctic is climate change]{.underline}. [It impacts not
only the people living in the Arctic itself]{.underline}, [but
also]{.underline} states surrounding the Arctic, and the rest of [the
world]{.underline}, [as sea and ocean levels increase]{.underline},
[oceans become desalinated]{.underline}, [and temperatures increase
worldwide]{.underline}. [There is a choice to focus on how states can
and have been cooperating on this issue]{.underline}, [thereby
incentivizing further collaboration down the line instead of thinking
solely on old-school ways of thinking about security]{.underline}. HOW
TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY [While we can think and write
about geopolitical hard security issues in the Arctic]{.underline}, [[we
can do so in a way that also gives airtime to cooperation and
collaboration]{.mark} rather than thinking solely about the latest
Russian military exercise or most recent scare about Chinese investment
in Greenland]{.underline}. [This is not to say that reporting on Russia
and China is not important or necessary]{.underline}, [but
rather]{.underline}, [reporting in a balanced way that takes the
responsibility of reporting all sides of an issue
seriously]{.underline}. On a policy level, [policymakers]{.underline}
and diplomats [can]{.underline} --- [and should]{.underline} --- [change
the framing of the Arctic in official policies]{.underline},
[speeches]{.underline}, [and critical international
organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic Council. [Security
shouldn't be only about the]{.underline} construction of new ships,
submarines, and [military]{.underline} exercises. [Planners who are
thinking about the role of militaries and institutions should consider
how security also refers to]{.underline} the [individual]{.underline}
security of Arctic residents, focusing on their ability to access food
[and]{.underline} water, potential insecurities arising from coastal
erosion --- 70% of which in the Arctic is built on currently thawing
permafrost --- as well as [societal insecurities]{.underline} that come
about from a lack of community resilience. Lastly, [there is a
tendency]{.underline} in international politics [to focus on conflictual
issues when instead [we should]{.mark} be finding other]{.underline},
[more cooperative issues to [encourage relationship-building among
actors in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Instead of immediately
pivoting to trying to negotiate arms control treaties amongst Arctic
states]{.underline}, [countries could instead find issues]{.underline},
[such as transparency]{.underline}, [s]{.underline}earch
[a]{.underline}nd [r]{.underline}escue [cooperation]{.underline}, [and
pollution clean-up that does not require as much political
capital]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} issues [might be framed as
low-stakes but they should not be]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly if
all stakeholders want [[to ensure that the Arctic is not
securitized]{.underline}]{.mark}. [RHETORIC MATTERS]{.underline} AFTER
ALL [[It matters how we talk about the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Whaling is a great example of where changing rhetoric has impacted
policy]{.underline}. While in the first half of the 20th century,
whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect of the economy,
[anti-whaling discourse changed the depiction of whales]{.underline} to
intelligent mammals. [This transformed the perception of whaling to
morally repugnant]{.underline}. It goes to show that [the way we talk
matters]{.underline}, [and it can matter more than material interests
that might seem more logical]{.underline}. [We can continue to use
bellicose rhetoric to describe relations between states and encourage
militarization on every side]{.underline}, [but that will end exactly
the way worse-case scenarios describe it]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, [[we]{.mark} can]{.underline} --- [and
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[change the way we talk and think
about the Arctic]{.mark} [to focus on cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline},
[change the way we frame the region]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} find
low-stakes issues on which to cooperate and]{.underline} hopefully
[[reverse or]{.mark} at least [slow the trajectory of securitizing the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### The alternative is to "Lose the Race" by not racing - Focusing on "winning" the race for the Arctic would cost the US in other areas of the world that are more important

**Caldon, 2023 - professor of National Security at the Air Force
University** \[Josh, April 13, Center for International Maritime
Security, Why the US is Losing The Race for the Arctic and What to Do
About It,
https://cimsec.org/why-the-us-is-losing-the-race-for-the-arctic-and-what-to-do-about-it/\]

[Economically speaking, the Arctic will likely remain a backwater for
market-driven economies]{.underline} for the foreseeable future. [The
relatively high costs of extracting resources and transporting goods
from the Arctic means the region is unlikely to become much more
attractive for Western companies]{.underline}, even if the ice continues
to retreat (which has slowed in recent years) and icebreakers improve,
except in times when specific resources are in sharp demand or when
there are long-term bottlenecks in other trade routes. [The resources
that Russia and China extract from the Arctic will contribute to the
overall global supply of these resources and decrease their overall
price for American consumers]{.underline}. As such[, Americans will gain
many of the benefits of Russia's and China's efforts in the Arctic while
Russia and China absorb the costs.]{.underline} In the case of scarce
rare-earth minerals that have spiked in demand and are monopolized by
China, it appears Sweden may fill this void for the US with its own
Arctic resources, even as companies search for substitutes for these
critical resources. Overall, the US should not ignore the Arctic, and it
should put to rest the notion that this region is a unique zone of peace
in an otherwise quite turbulent world. That being said, [Americans
should also not deem that losing the "race for the Arctic" will
critically threaten America's larger national interests. By not
attempting to compete head-to-head with Russia or China to "conquer" the
region, the US has incurred some advantages against these
competitors.]{.underline} As the US has been reminded again in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and through its observation of Russia's disastrous invasion
of Ukraine, [conquering territory comes with significant costs that can
weaken the material strength and ideational attractiveness of a
country.]{.underline} This, in turn, weakens a country's ability to
secure its most significant national interests. [The US]{.underline}
should continue to diplomatically, militarily, and economically
challenge Russia's and China's actions in the Arctic on humanitarian and
environmental grounds, but it also [should identify that China's and
Russia's actions in the Arctic come with high economic and soft power
costs that may relatively benefit the US.]{.underline} [Doing so will
allow the US to]{.underline} increase its ability to collectively defend
its interests in the Arctic with its allies and to [prioritize its
attention and resources on domains that are more important to it than
the Arctic.]{.underline}

### \--Extend Impacts - Green Colonialism

#### The Impact is Green Colonialism - Securitization of Arctic resources will sacrifice indigenous peoples to solve the climate crisis

**Adler, 2025- European Editor** (Katya, May 23, BBC. "Tensions Rise as
Superpowers Scrap for a Piece of the Arctic"
<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwqn7z02plo>)

[Indigenous communities in the region, just over half of whom live in
the Russian Arctic, often feel that there is a failure on the part of
those in power to acknowledge the rights of the peoples who have long
called the region home.]{.underline} Miyuki Daorana, a youth activist
from Greenland representing the Inughuit indigenous community, says when
Donald Trump claimed he wanted to buy the country during his first
presidency, they laughed it off. But this time it feels different, she
says. [\"Because of the current global political situation, with power
play and competition for resources, it\'s much more serious.\" She, and
others in the indigenous communities, accuse European countries of using
the \"climate crisis\" as an excuse to \"extract and invade indigenous
lands\".]{.underline} A woman smiles at the camera, wearing a scarf and
a blue jumper [\"It\'s something we call green colonialism or
developmental aggression where they really want to just take more and
more from lands,\" she says.]{.underline} \"\[The Arctic\] is not just a
topic for us. It\'s not just an interest, it\'s not a study. It\'s
literally our lives and real struggles and emotions and very unfair
injustices.

### \--Extend Impacts - Other Areas

#### The US does not need to compete for the Arctic - we have less at stake militarily or economically - focusing on the Arctic trades off with other more important areas

**Caldon, 2023 - professor of National Security at the Air Force
University** \[Josh, April 13, Center for International Maritime
Security, Why the US is Losing The Race for the Arctic and What to Do
About It,
https://cimsec.org/why-the-us-is-losing-the-race-for-the-arctic-and-what-to-do-about-it/\]

[Like Russia, China's companies are largely nationalized and it also
does not have the environmental or indigenous concerns in the Arctic
that the US does.]{.underline} It has spent the last two decades
increasing its manufacturing sector and its international trade ties.
This has increased its needs for natural resources and trade routes,
resulting in its plans to establish a "Polar Silk Road," under its
greater Belt and Road Initiative, in order to link the Arctic to China's
greater network of international trading posts and manufacturing
centers. As Russia has lost access to Western markets and technology
over the last two decades, it has increasingly turned towards an eager
China to help it build out its Arctic economic footprint. As such, China
also has more economic interests to defend in the Arctic than the US
does. What Does This Mean for the US? [The United States is not truly
interested in competing for the Arctic. It has relatively less military,
economic, or ideational interest in the region when compared to Russia
or China.]{.underline} Its strategic plans for the region have become
increasingly assertive in reaction to Russia's and China's efforts, but
lack funding or prioritization. However, [this lack of genuine interest
carries some benefits for the US when considering the larger
geopolitical context of the international system. America's lack of
interest in the region has paradoxically pushed the other Arctic states
to increase their security ties with the US]{.underline} and to take on
more security responsibilities for the region. Similar to World War II,
when Iceland and Denmark invited the US to help protect their territory
from foreign adversaries, [Russia's aggression pushed Sweden and Finland
to formally petition to join the US-dominated NATO]{.underline}. [The
inclusion of these states into the organization means that half of the
Arctic will soon be administered by NATO member states.]{.underline}
Specifically, the Nordic states of Norway, Sweden and Finland have
significant capabilities and economic stakes in the region that will
make up for America's relative lack of willingness and ability to
contain Russia's and China's ambitions in the region. These countries'
capabilities will be further complemented by Denmark and Canada, and the
other non-Arctic NATO states that have recently increased their defense
spending to deal with Russian aggression. [This collective defense in
the Arctic will allow the US to better focus on domains like space,
cyberspace, the Americas, and the Indo-Pacific, which are more important
than the Arctic to America's most critical national
interests.]{.underline}

#### The US does not need to expand into the Arctic - it is not necessary for the US economically

**Caldon, 2023 - professor of National Security at the Air Force
University** \[Josh, April 13, Center for International Maritime
Security, Why the US is Losing The Race for the Arctic and What to Do
About It,
https://cimsec.org/why-the-us-is-losing-the-race-for-the-arctic-and-what-to-do-about-it/\]

[The US largely has a free-market economy with strong interest groups
that challenge its willingness to expand its commercial footprint in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [This has overwhelmingly kept it from attempting to
control the Arctic like Russia has done and China is increasingly
attempting to do.]{.underline} It is important to look at the times when
American commercial interests have focused on the Arctic to understand
America's overall lack of interest in this region. The three times the
US has been economically drawn to the Arctic were to exploit temporarily
scarce resources. This occurred with whale oil and seal skins during the
18th and 19th century, gold at the end of the 19th century, and oil
during the mid-twentieth century. These intense periods of economic
interest in the Arctic resulted in America's purchase of Alaska from
Russia in 1867 and the development of Alaska in the decades afterwards.
Notably, however[, it is expensive and difficult to operate in the
Arctic]{.underline}. As Canadian Arctic expert, Michael Byers
highlights, even as the Arctic ice slowly melts, [the region remains in
complete darkness for half of the year and melting ice is dangerously
unpredictable.]{.underline} The Arctic is also austere and quite far
from the largest population centers of the world. [As such, the
intermittent economic demands for the region's natural resources have
relatively quickly resulted in substitutes being found for these goods
in less austere places]{.underline}. [Subsequently, the only portions of
Alaska that are significantly developed are in the sub-Arctic portion of
the state, with the exception of the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay -- which
also appear to be winding down with the advent of fracking and renewable
energy]{.underline}. Increasing environmental concerns (most of Alaska
is situated in nationally owned wilderness preserves) and native groups'
claims prohibitively increase the price of resource extraction from most
of Arctic Alaska even further. Many Americans believe the region should
be left to nature and to indigenous groups. [The US also does not have a
great need to develop the sea routes in the Arctic to improve its
international trade]{.underline}. It has a transnational road and
railway system and easy access to maritime trade routes which are
connected through the recently enlarged Suez Canal. These circumstances
mean that the US has very little motivation to establish sea routes
through the largely uninhabited, relatively shallow, and dangerously
unpredictable Arctic Ocean. Finally, Russia's aggression over the last
two decades, and increasing pressure from environmentally-based NGOs,
have pushed American-based companies even further away from Russia's
Arctic. [All told, since the US has only marginal economic incentives to
pursue the Arctic, it has not felt the need to develop harbors,
settlements, transport infrastructure, or icebreakers to increase its
footprint in the region. As such, it has relatively little capability to
"conquer the region,"]{.underline} but also relatively little to defend
in the region.

#### 1. Non-Unique - Arctic Economic Interest Exist - Russia has economic interests in the Arctic - oil and gas, rare earth metals, and fish.

[Russia's]{.underline} [sparsely populated]{.underline} [Arctic

[include]{.underline} [nonferrous and precious metals, stones,
and]{.underline} [other]{.underline} [raw materials]{.underline}.11
About [one-third of all fish]{.underline} [harvested in
Russia]{.underline} [comes from Arctic waters]{.underline}, making it
[a]{.underline} [key]{.underline} [food source.]{.underline} The Russian
[government hopes to increase that share by 2030]{.underline}, as
warming ocean water pushes fish stocks northward.12 [Tapping these
resources is Russia's primary economic interest]{.underline}, but [doing
so]{.underline} [will require]{.underline} [developing costly and
complicated road, rail, aviation, and maritime]{.underline}
[transportation infrastructure]{.underline} [to connect the
Arctic]{.underline} [to other parts of the country and
beyond]{.underline}. It will also [require expanding icebreaking
capabilities and developing ports, weather stations, and emergency
response facilities]{.underline}. Building this infrastructure is
Moscow's second economic priority in the region. Finally, [Russia
aspires to transform]{.underline} [its northern coast into]{.underline}
[the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, a navigable maritime corridor
through Arctic waters. Currently [passable without icebreaker
escort]{.underline} only in the summer months, the corridor is [used
mainly by Russian vessels to transport Arctic resources to markets in
Asia]{.underline}. Russia's 2020 Arctic strategy, however, envisions
transforming it into a competitive Asia-Europe maritime corridor by
2035.13

#### 2. Russia and China are already committed to mining rare earth metals in the Arctic - the race will cause more accidents due to increased ships in the Arctic

the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy",

\]

Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the Arctic [Climate change has
accelerated strategic competition]{.underline} in the region [among both
Arctic and non-Arctic nations]{.underline}, [such as China]{.underline}.
[Melting sea ice]{.underline} from rising global temperatures has
[created new military and economic opportunities]{.underline} in the
region. Since 1979[, the Arctic has warmed four times
faster]{.underline} than the rest of the world, [according to an August
2022 scientific study]{.underline} published in *Nature*.^3)^ As ice
rapidly melts in the Arctic, [increased access to critical rare earth
elements]{.underline}, such as platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and
nickel [emerge]{.underline}. Moreover[, melting ice is opening more
easily traversed Arctic waters]{.underline}, [which has led to a surge
of both military and commercial ship activity in the
region]{.underline}. [These two developments have increased the
potential for conflict in the Arctic.]{.underline} [Any nation that can
effectively mine, process, and refine the materials will have a
strategic advantage]{.underline}. [These minerals are required for
developing technologies ranging from renewable energy systems to
electronics used for national defense]{.underline}. According to the
World Bank, [the demand to produce minerals]{.underline}, many of which
are found in the Arctic, [could increase by nearly 500 percent by
2050]{.underline} to meet the growing demand for clean energy
technologies.^4)^ [China already dominates the global supply chain for
critical materials]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [depends on these materials for its economic
competitiveness and national defense]{.underline}.^5)^ As ice melts[,
new routes are emerging that are more navigable]{.underline}. [This has
resulted in more ship activity]{.underline} in the region. For instance,
[the Arctic Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine
Environment reports]{.underline} [that there has been a 37 percent
increase in ship numbers and distance sailed in the Arctic over the past
ten years.^6^]{.underline}^)^ While much of this activity is commercial,
[Russia and China have also taken advantage of the new sea
routes]{.underline} to project their naval power. [They have carried out
numerous regional deployments and patrols,]{.underline} [demonstrating
their ability to execute military operations]{.underline} in the austere
Arctic climate.^7)^ [The expanded presence of Russian and Chinese
ships]{.underline} in the region [poses a growing threat to NATO member
states. In October 2023, Finnish investigators suspected the Chinese
vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor over the]{.underline}
seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one pipeline. While
the international community has not assigned blame wholly to China[,
China later admitted to accidentally destroying an important gas
pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea in
2024]{.underline}. [These examples suggest that incidents of this nature
could become more likely as military activity increases in the
region.^8)^]{.underline}

#### 3. The race is real - US and China are currently racing to gain access to rare earth elements in the Arctic

the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy",

\]

As part of the US's proactive Arctic Strategy, [Washington should
prioritize economic investments]{.underline} [in companies owned by NATO
members]{.underline}. Through these investments, [energy security within
NATO can be improved]{.underline}, [and the nations can decrease their
dependence on rare earth materials from China]{.underline}. [The United
States has already taken]{.underline} [initial steps to secure critical
mineral and clean energy supply chains, but more can be
done]{.underline}. In September 2024[, the United States signed a
Critical Minerals Agreemen]{.underline}t with Norway, [demonstrating
both countries' commitment to working together to ensure energy
security]{.underline}.^31)^ Another such opportunity for the U.S. to
further support its Nordic Allies exists in Sweden. In 2024 the Swedish
mining company [LKAP discovered Europe's largest deposit of rare earth
elements]{.underline} in the northern city of Kiruna, Sweden[. Norway
and Sweden have already begun collaborating to increase energy security
through the Norwegian company]{.underline}, [REETec, which has developed
technology to separate rare earth metals]{.underline} that competes with
China's production of these materials.^32)^ [According to the CEO of
LKAB, Jan Moström, this cooperation provides the foundation to develop a
"strong and sustainable Nordic value chain for rare earth
metals]{.underline}."^33[)]{.underline}^ [A proactive U.S. Arctic
Strategy]{.underline} that takes into consideration [increased NATO
energy security through Nordic]{.underline} investment further bolsters
the United States' ability to decrease dependence on China and should be
pursued.

### Extend - Missile Threat Growing

#### Russia is abandoning arms control treaties - they are developing new missiles and targetting the US

**Jackson, 2025 - news editor at Newsweek** (Jon, January 31, Newsweek,
"Russia May Expand Arsenal to Counter US Efforts: Russian Diplomat"
https://www.newsweek.com/russia-may-expand-nuclear-arsenal-counter-us-efforts-russian-diplomat-2023718)

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February
2022[, tensions have been high between Russia and Kyiv\'s Western
allies, which includes the United States]{.underline}. [Putin and
various Russian officials have frequently raised the specter of nuclear
escalation. The Russian leader also suspended his country\'s
participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction agreement two
years ago,]{.underline} which was the last remaining treaty between
Moscow and Washington that limited nuclear arsenals. What To Know In an
executive order this week, President Donald Trump directed the military
to start \"construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield,
which will be made all in the USA.\" The Iron Dome is an Israeli air
defense system that intercepts incoming rockets and shells, and the U.S.
supported its development. According to an English translation by the
Russian state news agency Tass of Mashkov\'s International Affairs
interview, the ambassador said that the U.S. further developing a global
missile defense system \"puts an end to the prospects of strategic

### Extend Solvency - Domain Awareness

#### Expanding Domain Awareness is necessary to prevent miscalculation from expansion into the Arctic

Avoid a 'FONOP vicious circle' in the Arctic [Demonstrations of
uncontested access at sea and in the air in the Arctic are slowly
becoming a 'new normal'. This tit-for-tat, action/reaction military
dynamic reinforces the existing security dilemma between Russia and NATO
and other coastal nations. The greatest risk of tactical errors and
miscalculation in the Arctic is undoubtedly posed by incidents at sea
during day-to-day activities,]{.underline} from patrols to
demonstrations of freedom of navigation. [A 'FONOP vicious circle' --
which would consist of successive demonstrations of access and presence
from NATO and Russian forces through naval and aerial operations --
cannot be allowed to develop. Risks can be mitigated by refraining from
unnecessary escalation.]{.underline} [However, the Kremlin cannot be
allowed to believe that Russia 'owns' the approaches of the Barents
Sea]{.underline} or the Bering Sea, [nor that the Russian armed forces
could]{.underline} contest the operating environment, [deny US and NATO
regional presence or achieve military superiority in contested spaces.
This can be achieved by increasing the regional presence of MDA
capabilities, as well as by pushing back systematically against Russia's
narrative.]{.underline} Invest in Arctic-specific technologies [Arctic
partners must invest in cold weather-enabling and polar-specific
capabilities that contest Russia's sense of military superiority in the
region -- this should include MDA]{.underline}, ASW and mine
counter-measure capabilities and maritime patrol aviation, as well as
hardening military infrastructure and systems against Russian electronic
warfare. With specific reference to the Pacific Arctic, this could be
achieved in the US by restarting an extended form of continuous bomber
presence.

Following Finnish and Swedish accession to NATO, [the alliance's center
of gravity,]{.underline} its primary source of strength and stability,
[shifted North and closer to the Russian border]{.underline}. This is
not the first instance of NATO borders moving closer to Russia. In 2007,
Putin provided a final "friendly" warning that NATO expansion
"represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual
trust."25) [The National Defense Strategy (NDS) reaffirms its commitment
to NATO, underscoring the importance of collective defense aimed at
deterring Russian aggression]{.underline}. Despite this stated
commitment, the NDS does not directly address how it will respond in the
event that Russia attacks a NATO member state, forcing the alliance to
respond. While the current NDS and Arctic Strategy offer assurances of
protection to the U.S. homeland, [a proactive Arctic posture will
mitigate future conflict in the region.]{.underline} The United States
already views itself as a leader in the European Arctic. Since the end
of the Cold War, [the United States has sought to uphold international
law]{.underline}, close gaps in governance, and protect sovereign rights
in the European Arctic.^26)^ [The United States was integral in
developing multiple intergovernmental institutions]{.underline},
including the Arctic Council in 1991.^27)^ With growing competition in
the European Arctic[, the United States should continue to use its great
power status to insert itself as a lead actor]{.underline} in the region
[through the establishment of a proactive Arctic Strategy]{.underline}
coupled with enhanced economic and military cooperation with its Nordic
NATO Allies. Today, while Russia is engrossed in its war against
Ukraine[, the United States and its allies have the opportunity to
remain one step ahead]{.underline}. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine
in 2022[, the United States has begun to increase its presence in the
European High North]{.underline}. Underscoring the importance of
collective defense, the United States has entered into several new
bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCA) with Nordic nations. In
2022, the United States signed a DCA with Norway, which acknowledges
that the presence of U.S. forces in Norway contributes to strengthening
the security and stability of the region and permit American forces
unimpeded access to four Norwegian military bases.^28)^ Since the
establishment of the defense agreement, Norway and the United States
added an amendment, allowing U.S. forces and NATO allies to access eight
additional facilities in [Norway for military purposes]{.underline},
emphasizing the growing security threat in the European Arctic.^29)^
Following Norway's lead, [Denmark signed its DCA with the United
States]{.underline} in 2023 [followed by Finland and Sweden]{.underline}
in 2024.^30[)]{.underline}^ [DCAs such as these offer increased and
mutually beneficial opportunities for the United States and its Nordic
NATO Allies to prepare for any future hostilities.]{.underline}

[The United States has been increasing its ability to work with its
Swedish and Finnish counterparts in the case of war. The United States
should establish bilateral training exercises with Sweden and Finland in
order to give these new NATO nations a greater understanding of how to

forces' understanding of how to operate effectively in an Arctic
environment]{.underline}, making it a more reliable and efficient
partner for Arctic allies[. This operational experience ensures that

during a conflict with Russia.]{.underline} Conclusion: How a Proactive
Arctic Strategy Supports America's Focus on the Indo-Pacific The United

approach aimed at reducing the possibility of escalation in the Arctic.
Moreover, [the current strategy recognizes Russia's and China's Arctic
ambitions]{.underline} and that the growing collaboration between
[Russia and the PRC have]{.underline} "[the potential to alter the

[The strategy presents a tangible and realistic way forward for the
U.S.]{.underline} to enhance the Joint Force's Arctic capabilities,
engage with Allies and partners, and demonstrate an ability to work
together across defense forces. Although [the strategy indicates
increased U.S. involvement]{.underline} in the Arctic, [.]{.underline}.
[The 2024 Arctic Strategy already outlines a tangible way for the United
States to commit energy and resources to the region]{.underline}.
Although a deliberate shift in messaging will not change the U.S.
footprint in the Arctic[, it will change the U.S. mindset towards the
region. By making the Arctic a priority, the U.S. demonstrates its

Even more disturbing is the [increasing levels of collaboration between

cooperation between the Chinese and Russian coast guards in the
region]{.underline}. \"This kind of increasing levels of military
cooperation is new,\" she said. \"Certainly, [it\'s new within and
around Alaska]{.underline}.\" [The new DOD Arctic strategy is aimed at
preserving the region as a place that is both stable and
secure]{.underline}, Ferguson said. She also discussed the Defense
Department\'s three main lines of effort in the region. The first is
[enhancing domain awareness to see and detect threats, and to ensure
U.S. forces can operate in the region effectively]{.underline}. \"We\'re
also really focused on engaging with our allies and partners,\" she
said. These nations are a unique U.S. strategic advantage that stretches
from the border of European Russia to the Bering Strait. These are
\"seven like-minded partners that are incredibly militarily capable and
also have heavy geostrategic alignment with us,\" she said. Finally, the
United States is working on using military exercises in the region.
\"We\'ve long had exercises that operate in the region, but we\'re
really looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect, working
alongside our allies and partners,\" she said. There\'s an evolution in
how competitors think about the region, Ferguson said. \"We\'re going to
continue on the DOD side to monitor military activity.\" But this
attention cannot be just limited to that. [The Chinese are using other
aspects of their national power to insinuate themselves into the region.
China is involved in scientific and research projects in the region.

### Extend - Strategic Stability Links

#### US missile defense causes Russia to develop more missiles - it destroys the stability of deterrence.

**Jackson, 2025 - news editor at Newsweek** (Jon, January 31, Newsweek,
"Russia May Expand Arsenal to Counter US Efforts: Russian Diplomat"
https://www.newsweek.com/russia-may-expand-nuclear-arsenal-counter-us-efforts-russian-diplomat-2023718)

[Russia may expand and upgrade its nuclear arsenal if the United States
continues to push ahead with the development of a missile defense
system]{.underline}, a top Russian diplomat said in an interview
published on Thursday. Grigory Mashkov, the Russian Foreign Ministry\'s
special ambassador, made the comments to the Russian journal
International Affairs, according to Reuters. Newsweek reached out to the
Russian Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Department of Defense via email on
Thursday for comment. Why It Matters Since Russian President Vladimir
Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, tensions have been high between
Russia and Kyiv\'s Western allies, which includes the United States.
Putin and various Russian officials have frequently raised the specter
of nuclear escalation. The Russian leader also suspended his country\'s
participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction agreement two
years ago, which was the last remaining treaty between Moscow and
Washington that limited nuclear arsenals. What To Know In an executive
order this week[, President Donald Trump directed the military to start
\"construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense
shield,]{.underline} which will be made all in the USA.\" The Iron Dome
is an Israeli air defense system that intercepts incoming rockets and
shells, and the U.S. supported its development. According to an English
translation by the Russian state news agency Tass of Mashkov\'s
International Affairs interview, [the ambassador said that the U.S.
further developing a global missile defense system \"puts an end to the
prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction and preservation of
strategic stability on the previous terms.\"]{.underline} \"In the
emerging realities, it is no longer possible to talk about strategic
stability in its classical bilateral context, or else we may plunge into
another illusion,\" Mashkov said, per Tass. He added, \"It is not ruled
out that in the current conditions of confrontation with the West, with
its policy of inflicting strategic damage on Russia, [we may face the
need for moving away from restrictions on nuclear and missile arsenals
in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase.\"]{.underline}
He continued by saying Russia would examine its \"commitments in the
area of strengthening transparency and confidence-building measures, and
suspend discussions on nuclear risks and threats, which are becoming
empty talk in the context of growing efforts by the West to undermine
strategic and non-strategic nuclear deterrent forces.\" Mashkov also
said that arms control and disarmament in Russia should be more aligned
with \"U.S. global dominance ambitions.\" \"It is difficult to judge
whether our policy of cooperation with the Americans only in areas which
they are interested in is reasonable, if at all,\" he said. What People

### Extend - Submarine Links

#### Russia reacts to Western provocations that threaten its submarines in the Arctic - the want to be on the defensive in the Arctic

**Rumer et al, 2021 - Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at
Carnegie** \[Eugene, Richard Sokolsky, and Paul Stronski, March 29,
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "Russia in the Arctic---A
Critical Examination"
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/03/russia-in-the-arctica-critical-examination?lang=en\]

[Russia's Arctic ambitions have attracted increasing attention in the
West]{.underline} over the past decade as climate change opens up new
opportunities in the region for navigation and exploration of its
riches. For its part, [Moscow casts a wary eye on what it sees as a
challenge from the United States and]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO) to its]{.underline} position and [ambitions
there. The Kremlin's rhetoric about Western encroachment has become more
strident, in sync with its enhanced military posture]{.underline} and
ambitious economic and infrastructure projects. Russian interest in the
Arctic has deep historic roots that extend all the way to the sixteenth
century and the conquest of Siberia driven by the never-ending quest for
more resources and secure trading routes. Modern-day Russian posture in
the Arctic is integral to its overall confrontation with the West, in
which Europe is the principal theater. [The]{.underline}
[saber-rattling]{.underline} [in the Arctic]{.underline} [and
threatening rhetoric are driven by]{.underline} several factors:
preparations for the unlikely, but potentially catastrophic contingency
of war in Europe, [the need to secure]{.underline} [its]{.underline}
[second-strike]{.underline} [nuclear capabilities]{.underline} ([the
bulk of which is based around the Kola Peninsula]{.underline}), and the
quest for resources to pay for the proverbial guns and butter as the
competition with the West shows no sign of abating. Great-power
ambitions and the interests of powerful bureaucratic elites and business
interests also play a role. AMBITIONS VS. REALITY It remains to be seen
whether Russia will be successful in realizing these ambitions.
[Its]{.underline} [nuclear and conventional]{.underline}
[naval]{.underline} [forces]{.underline} [in northwest
Russia]{.underline} [are increasingly vulnerable to NATO's long-range
precision weapons]{.underline}. It is unclear whether the development of
the Northern Sea Route (NSR) along Russia's northern coastline into a
major shipping route between Europe and Asia and the associated
commercial projects are feasible and sustainable in the face of high
costs and logistical complexity of operating in difficult climatic
conditions with limited infrastructure, increased commercial competition
from other countries, uncertain demand for hydrocarbons as the world
shifts to green technologies, and the possibility of additional Western
sanctions. The Kremlin's posture in the Arctic is likely to continue as
it enjoys backing from President Vladimir Putin and top military,
government, and business actors. Its ability to achieve these broad
ambitions for the region, however, is questionable at best. IMPLICATIONS
FOR THE UNITED STATES AND NATO [Russia's]{.underline} [conception of
its]{.underline} [security requirements and NATO's]{.underline}
[mutual-defense and]{.underline} [deterrence commitments]{.underline}
[on the other hand]{.underline} [have resulted in a tense
standoff]{.underline} [along the alliance's northern flank as their
forces operate in]{.underline} [close proximity]{.underline}. [Tempting
as it may be to view the Arctic through the prism of great-power
competition]{.underline}---which undoubtedly would fit with Russia's
quest for recognition as a great power---[there is little to suggest
that]{.underline} [its military posture]{.underline} [in the Arctic is a
fundamentally new undertaking]{.underline}. [Rather, it]{.underline}
[signals]{.underline} [the return to a version of its Cold War--era
posture centered around long-standing missions of]{.underline}
[protecting]{.underline} [the sanctuaries of]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} [ballistic missile]{.underline}
[submarine]{.underline} [fleet]{.underline} [and operations in the North
Atlantic in the event of a war in Europe]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline}
[the Russian military is resuming these missions]{.underline} [with
fewer resources and facing a more formidable array of adversary
capabilities]{.underline} [than during the Cold War]{.underline}.
[Russia]{.underline} has staked out ambitious territorial claims in the

# Nuclear Power Advantage

### Nuclear Power Advantage

#### Russia is expanding its nuclear power in the Arctic

**Starchark 24, expert on Russian Nuclear Policy at Carnegie Politika**
\[Maxim, November 1, Carnegie Politika, "Russia's Arctic Policy Poses A
Growing Nuclear Threat"
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/10/russia-arctic-nuclear-threat?lang=en\]

[The war in Ukraine continues to drain Russia's resources away from
critical areas, including nuclear security in the Arctic.]{.underline}
Despite this, Moscow remains committed to the development of this
strategic region, and has not stopped building nuclear sites there. In
September, Norway detected elevated levels of radioactive Cesium-137
near its Arctic border with Russia. As [Russia is no longer cooperating
with other nations on nuclear safety in the Arctic]{.underline}, this is
unlikely to be the last such report. Around the same time that [Norway
reported the surge in radiation levels]{.underline}, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov
[accused](https://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/minister_speeches/1970336/)
NATO of militarizing the Arctic through increasingly frequent crisis
response exercises. Yet Russia is guilty of the same. Its new foreign
policy [concepts](https://www.mid.ru/ru/detail-material-page/1860586/)
and
[doctrines](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/official_documents/1688734/)
call the Arctic "a vital area for ensuring our national interests in the
global ocean," and Moscow has
[warned](https://iz.ru/1687752/2024-04-25/mid-rf-predupredil-ob-otvete-zapadu-na-voennuiu-aktivnost-v-arktike)
that it will use "any means necessary" to secure its interests there.
Those means include the Northern Fleet, whose ships regularly---and
conspicuously---[traverse](https://flot.com/2024/530231/?sphrase_id=8945266&ysclid=m03o8w5tho160535187)
the Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines. Particularly
crucial to Russia's plans is its fleet of nuclear submarines, which has
[become](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Russia-Nuclear-Report-2021-FINAL.pdf)
significantly more active in northern waters in the past decade. The
fleet consists of twelve strategic nuclear submarines carrying up to 192
nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, twenty-four nuclear submarines armed
with cruise missiles, and ten special-purpose nuclear submarines, with
another twelve nuclear submarines under construction or nearly ready for
commission. The Arctic is also a testing ground for new nuclear-powered,
nuclear-armed weapons---from the Burevestnik cruise missile to the
Poseidon torpedo---contributing to both regional tensions and the risk
of [radiation
accidents](https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nuclear-hazards-in-Arctic-policy-brief_updated.pdf).
That risk is growing, not only because of Russia's military activities,
but also because of its increasing economic activity in the Arctic.
Rosatom, the state nuclear company, operates the eight-ship nuclear
icebreaker fleet that is key to the Northern Sea Route, along which 36
million tons of cargo were
[transported](https://www.rosatom.ru/en/press-centre/news/historical-record-of-the-northern-sea-route-the-cargo-carriage-volume-in-2023-exceeded-36-254-mln-to/)
in 2023, up from 4 million in 2014. That number is
[expected](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/news/2023/04/07/969969-perevozki-po-sevmorputi)
to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker fleet is
to expand by seven more vessels. Rosatom's footprint in the Arctic
[extends](http://www.scrf.gov.ru/media/files/file/hcTiEHnCdn6TqRm5A677n5iE3yXLi93E.pdf)
to Russia's two nuclear power plants there: Kola and Bilibino. They do
not generate enough energy for the country's Arctic development needs
(the region contains trillions of cubic meters of natural gas and
billions of tons of oil), for which Rosatom
[estimates](https://www.rbc.ru/business/15/06/2023/648ab3eb9a7947624a4cdd5a?ysclid=m0p96883wl845087878)
that no fewer than fifteen floating nuclear power plants are required.
The company separately plans to build several small modular reactors
(SMRs), the first of which should be up and running by 2028. In the past
five years, [Russia's development of the Arctic has seen the number of
civil and military nuclear reactors in the region increase by 30
percent, from sixty-two to eighty-one. By 2035, it is estimated there
may be 118.]{.underline} In response to growing concerns about nuclear
safety, Rosatom has
[offered](http://nsrus.ru/files/ks131022/Muratov.pdf?ysclid=m0patkdc5b798407832)
reassurances on SMRs' passive safety systems. But [environmentalists
[stress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzHd1I4PFo8&ysclid=m17x3oio99784091568)
that SMRs are experimental, and therefore high-risk. Of particular
concern is how they will be transported. It has already been
[reported](https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russia-sends-nuclear-fuel-across-arctic-ship-history-safety-violations)
that ships not designed to transport nuclear materials have been used to
do just that]{.underline}, and [further nuclear safety violations cannot
be [ruled
out](https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russia-sends-nuclear-fuel-across-arctic-ship-history-safety-violations)]{.underline}.
In addition, a 2022 study
[found](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2022/05/small-modular-reactors-produce-high-levels-nuclear-waste)
that [SMRs produce more radioactive waste than conventional nuclear
power plants.]{.underline}

#### Russia won't be able to respond to nuclear emergencies in the Arctic because program funding is being cut.

[Crucially, it has become more difficult for Russia to respond promptly
to nuclear emergencies.]{.underline} The Arctic is marked by extreme
weather conditions, huge distances, and poor infrastructure[. Notifying
partners of a nuclear incident as soon as possible is of the utmost
importance,]{.underline} so that complicated interagency and
international coordination may commence. [Yet Russia is out of the
Norwegian-led Arctic and North Atlantic Security and Emergency
Preparedness Network and is no longer invited to nuclear incident
response exercises, even as an observer.]{.underline} As the 2000 Kursk
submarine disaster made painfully clear, [Russia was never inclined to
accept outside assistance in nuclear emergencies.]{.underline} However,
cooperation with partners was at least theoretically possible. Now, any
[prospect](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3820/6434)
of a regional agreement on nuclear security in the Arctic establishing a
joint emergency response mechanism is as good as dead. [Rosatom
[admits](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/norway-and-russia-suspend-co-operation-on-nuclear-safety-9759051/)
that Russia being cut off from foreign funding means projects related to
nuclear safety in the Arctic will stall.]{.underline} Yet it maintains
that they will not be canceled altogether, which would seem plausible
given the company's
[financials](https://report.rosatom.ru/go/rosatom/go_rosatom_2023/rosatom_2023_ru.pdf).
However, [in practice, funding is being cut, and the results are
clear.]{.underline} Hitherto largely financed by Norway, efforts to
remove solid radioactive waste from Andreyeva Bay may be suspended
indefinitely, Bellona
experts [fear](https://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Nuclear-legacy-report_RUS.pdf).

#### Cuts to Russian safety spending have increased the danger of nuclear emergencies - they cannot afford to keep their nuclear power plans safe, and their secrecy hinders cooperations

**Starchark 24, expert on Russian Nuclear Policy at Carnegie Politika**

Growing Nuclear Threat"
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/10/russia-arctic-nuclear-threat?lang=en\]

[Rosatom's accounts show that nuclear safety is not a priority. Federal
spending on nuclear and radiation safety has steadily been falling since
about 2020, and is expected to be cut by a further 1.5 billion
rubles]{.underline} between 2024 and 2026. Cuts of 2.3 billion rubles
are planned for efforts related to radioactive waste disposal and
management and the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. At the same time,
tariffs for the disposal of radioactive waste are to increase by an
average of 33 percent by 2027. [The opacity of the Russian state does
not help matters. Gone are the days when many projects were implemented
with the involvement of NGOs, and Rosatom's disclosures offer so little
information as to be useless]{.underline} as a guide to Russia's plans
for the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. [The same concerns extend to
Russia's response to nuclear emergencies.]{.underline} Since many sites
are operated by the military or considered key to national security,
[gathering information about incidents is]{.underline} [extremely
difficult](https://barentsobserver.co/sites/default/files/atom-rapport_barents_observer_1.pdf)[.
Before the war, the prospect of a nuclear accident in the Arctic seemed
remo]{.underline}te. It was only slightly easier to
[imagine](https://oaarchive.arctic-council.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/838447b4-9f18-4b20-aa94-9d1e8e669fb9/content)
one involving a nuclear vessel or a floating nuclear power plant. Today,
the situation is deteriorating rapidly, as Russia continues to build new
nuclear sites while halting the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. [The
absence of international assistance and regional cooperation, along with
the dwindling attention paid to nuclear safety in the Arctic by the
federal authorities, spells further trouble.]{.underline} That the risks
are growing is no concern to Russia, which may in fact see the peril of
its development of the Arctic as a feature, not a bug. It could form
part of its policy of blackmail, with Russia taking things to the brink
to force concessions from the West such as the resumption of financing
and technical assistance---irrespective of developments on other fronts.

[The Arctic's radiation risks are therefore only rising. The situation
was far from ideal to begin with, thanks to the region's rich Soviet
nuclear inheritance. There are some 18,000 sunken assets that were or
remain dangerously radioactive, a thousand of which continue to pose a
threat]{.underline}. [They include submarines, reactors, and high-level
waste]{.underline}. In addition, the Russian Arctic is peppered with
facilities for storing nuclear fuel---fresh and spent alike---and
refining it. [Ensuring the safety of new nuclear assets and managing the
Soviet nuclear inheritance is difficult and expensive]{.underline}, and
an endeavor in which Russia used to work closely with foreign partners[.

percent]{.underline} [foreign

[Years of international cooperation on nuclear security ended with the
invasion of Ukraine. Russia was cut off from foreign
funding]{.underline}, not only bilaterally but also through EU and
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development programs. Technical
assistance dried up as well, precluding the maintenance of foreign
equipment and halting the supply of spare parts. [Institutions also
stopped working together, with Russia leaving the Barents Euro-Arctic
Council]{.underline} and being suspended from the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. The
European Technical Safety Organisations Network cut ties with Russia's
Scientific and Engineering Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety.

### Extend Uniqueness - Stalemate Now

#### The Ukraine war won't escalate - it is currently stalemated

**Wasielewski, 23 - Director of the Center for the Study of Intelligence
and Nontraditional Warfare** \[Philip 12/11/23, "Stalemate Is Not
Checkmate in Ukraine" Policy Commons
https://policycommons.net/artifacts/10881324/stalemate-is-not-checkmate-in-ukraine/11759116/
\]

[The ground war in Ukraine is now at a stalemate, a predicament which is
neither a sign of impending defeat nor an unusual occurrence in war.
While one aspect of a war may be "frozen" for a time, wars usually
consist of many different geographic theaters, environments (air, land,
sea, space, cyber), and aspects (economic, psychological, political),
whose combination is what generally determines victory or
defeat]{.underline}. History has shown that past stalemates in war often
cause participants to innovate and create new tactics and/or
technologies and mobilize heretofore untouched resources to move past
stalemate and towards victory.The decision to provide aid to Ukraine
should not depend on what phase this war is in, even if it is currently
a static one. The United States started its support to the Ukrainian
people at their darkest hour when there was little hope of survival, let
alone victory. It should not end it because the war has not met
arbitrary expectations or timelines. The ground war in Ukraine is
currently stalemated. However, the current situation on the battlefield
does not necessarily presage how the war will end. Kyiv and Washington
can both make decisions to profoundly alter the future course of the
war. For Kyiv, this means reforms in its military personnel and
mobilization systems. For Washington, it means providing the type and
quantity of aid that will enable a Ukrainian victory and not just help
it stave off defeat. Furthermore, e nding US aid to Ukraine, as some
suggest as a reaction to the current static situation, would be
tantamount to handing Russia a victory in its war of aggression and
encouraging it to take similar steps in the future. Instead, Congress
should continue the support necessary for Ukraine to create a
battlefield and political situation that will best favor Ukrainian and
US interests. Fears of Stalemate Two recent articles, one in Time
magazine and one by General Valerii Zaluzhnyi , the Ukrainian armed
forces commander-in-chief, speaking of the Russo-Ukrainian war as a
stalemate, have caused considerable unease both in Ukraine and the
United States. In the halls of Congress, some senators and
representatives say these articles are proof that victory for Kyiv is
unobtainable and US support should be curtailed or ended. What may be
lost in translation, however, is that battlefield stalemates are neither
uncommon nor catastrophic unless political and military leaders make
them so. In other words, stalemate is not checkmate. Stalemates are a
part of warfare. During the American Civil War, the armies of Generals
Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee were fixed in trenches at Petersburg
for approximately ten months. In World War II, German and Soviet forces
were locked in a similar stalemate around Leningrad for over two years.
The stalemate most often referenced when discussing the Russo-Ukrainian
war is that of the Western front during World War I from the winter of
1914--1915 up until the spring of 1918. Those stalemates eventually
ended when one side found a way to get around or through the trenches
and fortifications of the other. Stalemates often spur innovation.
During World War I, the major belligerents tried different ways to
overcome the tyranny of trench lines that left no open flanks and the
technology of new weapons such as the machine gun and rapid-fire
artillery pieces. Germany tried to break the stalemate strategically via
unrestricted submarine warfare to destroy Britain's economy and
tactically via stormtrooper tactics to infiltrate past trench lines into
rear areas. Britain's response was to create another new technology, the
tank, and formulate tactics to integrate tanks with artillery and
infantry forces. The French believed innovations in artillery tactics
developed in 1916 would lead to victory in 1917. However, a German
innovation---defense in depth---stopped French attacks cold. Only Russia
did not attempt to innovate, repeating its strategy of massive infantry
attacks, as in the Brusilov and Kerensky offensives, until its army
dissolved in mutiny and desertion. Why Stalemate [Today's stalemate in
Ukraine is the result of three factors: one technological, one
topographical, and one psychological.]{.underline} Modern battlefield
surveillance, the topography of southern Ukraine that provides for
minimal concealment, and the fact that both sides view the conflict in
existential terms contribute to the current situation on the
battlefield. [*Technological* The combination of near-ubiquitous
battlefield surveillance and precision-guided munitions makes a modern
battlefield a dangerous place to move in.]{.underline} Today's cheap,
abundant, and easy-to-use drones provide both sides a literal bird's eye
view of the battlefield. Drones, integrated with other modern advances
(e.g., night vision devices, counter-battery radars, satellite imagery,
etc.) provide battlefield awareness undreamt of just a generation
before[. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets,
combined with precision-guided munitions, and overseen by a
well-organized command, control, and communications network create what
the Russians call a]{.underline} [reconnaissance-strike
complex](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/the-war-in-ukraine-shows-how-technology-is-changing-the-battlefield)
[. In other words, if something can be seen on the battlefield, it can
be hit almost immediately]{.underline}. The world saw this on a smaller
scale in the Second Karabakh War in 2020. Today, it is a central feature
of the war in Ukraine. *Topographical* This integrated system of
ubiquitous reconnaissance and precision fires is especially effective in
southern Ukraine due to its topography, which provides minimal
concealment. The battlefield is mostly one of large, open fields divided
by tree lines and interspersed with small villages. There are few large
forests making it difficult to assemble troops, hide supply dumps, or
position artillery batteries.

#### Russia will not be able to continue the war in Ukraine due to economic troubles

**Ma, 25 - CEO of ThreeEQ** \[Jason 1/27/25, Fortune, "The Russian war
economy is facing a 'moment of truth' as Putin's dwindling cash reserves
raise odds of a financial crash, expert says"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-war-economy-facing-moment-223309337.html\]

[Russia's economy is facing a "moment of truth" as high inflation, an
ailing private sector, and critical shortages are poised to constrain
Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine,]{.underline} according to economist and
author Anders Åslund.Nearly three years after launching its invasion[,
Russia is headed for stagflation, meaning high inflation combined with
minimal growth,]{.underline} he wrote at Project Syndicate on Jan.
14.While official statistics show inflation quickened to an annual pace
of 9.5% in December from 8.9% in November, [other measures suggest it's
far higher. For example, independent research firm Romir has calculated
that prices for a basket of certain consumer goods jumped by 22% in
September.]{.underline} ["Strained by these factors, the Russian economy
is approaching its moment of truth,"]{.underline} Åslund wrote[.
"Inflation will continue to rise in 2025, and people will get even
angrier over higher food prices. Major bankruptcies are looming, and the
Russian state cannot afford large bailouts]{.underline}. Business
leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage
of labor---and soldiers---is reaching a crisis stage."The worst
shortage, however, is budget cash as liquid reserves are on pace to run
out this fall, he predicted. [By then, budget cuts will be
necessary,]{.underline} while the Kremlin may have to resort to the
"Soviet sins" of price controls and rationing."[As the risk of a
financial crash rises, Russia's imperiled economy is about to pose
serious constraints on Putin's war]{.underline}," he addedÅslund and
other Russia watchers have previously said that the economy will be
unable to sustain the war on Ukraine for much longer. [For instance,
Russia already can't manufacture certain weapons at a high enough rate
to replace battlefield losses and is dipping into Cold War--era
inventories. That means Russia may not be able to wage war beyond late
2025, when it will begin running out of key weapons.]{.underline}
