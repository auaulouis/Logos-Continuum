In contrast to the Governor's office, the [[State Legislature]{.mark}
has been [significantly engaged]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}
policy planning, [forming]{.mark} the [Alaska State Arctic Policy
Commission]{.mark}. The [Commission]{.mark} is charged to
**[hold]{.mark} a series of [hearings across the state]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [gather]{.mark} the [views]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark} priorities [of]{.mark} the [citizens]{.mark}**, many of
whom are already living and adapting to changing
conditions]{.underline}. Members of the Commission have also been
[active in meeting with US State Department task force involved in
implementing the National Strategy on the Arctic Region]{.underline}.
[Part of the role of the Commission is to [elevate]{.mark}
[local]{.mark} and regional [perspectives]{.mark}
[into]{.mark}]{.underline} federal and [[international policy]{.mark}
venues such as the Arctic Council]{.underline}.26 Like many subnational
governmental actors, the [Commission is [interested]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
**[strengthening]{.mark} the [coordination]{.mark} [across]{.mark}
[geographic scales]{.mark}** from state and local to international
levels.]{.underline}

The [[Commission's work resulted in]{.mark} the **[introduction]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} an [Arctic legislative initiative]{.mark}**, including the
creation of an **[investment fund for Arctic infra]{.mark}structure**, a
**[new port authority]{.mark}** to govern maritime facilities siting and
development, and a [**joint resolution** of]{.mark} the [Alaska]{.mark}
[House]{.mark} of Representatives [expressing]{.mark} the sentiment
[that]{.mark} the US [government]{.mark} [should consider]{.mark}
[Alaskan priorities]{.mark} during its chairmanship of the Arctic
Council from 2015 to 2017.]{.underline}27 General priorities have been
identified by the Governor, the Alaska Legislature, and civil society
groups, but only the Legislature has undertaken a transparent public
process to develop its set of priorities.

Arctic policy for Alaska has been well represented by US Senators Lisa
Murkowski and Mark Begich (2009--15) in their role linking the state's
priorities to federal policy processes. In July 2012, Begich and
Murkowski sent a letter to President Obama urging the federal government
to take a more cohesive approach to the Arctic.28 The senators noted
[[more than 20 federal agencies]{.mark} [publishing]{.mark} [overlapping
policy]{.mark} recommendations and roadmaps to chart the future of the
American Arctic]{.underline}. Additionally, they highlighted the
inclusion of Arctic issues and priorities in the national strategies of
neighboring Arctic states for comparison. The [senators called for a
strategy that provided specific implementation goals and objectives for
areas spanning from protection of national sovereignty to promoting
resource development and addressing the cultural and subsistence
livelihoods of Arctic indigenous peoples]{.underline}.29 These
[objectives require clear collaboration between]{.underline} [the
state]{.underline} [and]{.underline} federal governments as well as
additional [private and public stakeholders]{.underline}. Begich and
Murkowski requested that the Arctic strategy tie together the now
disparate pieces of individual agency policies and visions.

The letter identified the actors that play a role in establishing Arctic
policies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
the Department of the Interior, the US Navy, and the US Coast Guard, all
federal actors. The Senators urge that [a [comprehensive]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark} [should]{.mark} work to [unify]{.mark}
and organize the policies of]{.underline} not just federal but [[state
and local actors]{.mark}]{.underline} as well. The letter to President
Obama ends with a request for the State of Alaska to have a 'meaningful
role' in the creation of a national Arctic strategy. On 10 May 2013,
just short of a year after Senators Begich and Murkowski's letter to the
President was published, the White House released the National Strategy
for the Arctic Region. 30 The Strategy begins by identifying the need to
proceed in a way that leverages 'expertise, resources, and cooperation
from the State of Alaska, Alaska Natives, and stakeholders across the
entire nation and throughout the international community'.31 The
Strategy also identifies the key stakeholders in the management of the
American Arctic as the federal, state, local, and tribal authorities, as
well as the private sector and international partners. These
stakeholders are recognized as playing key roles in the three objectives
of the strategy: advancing US security interests, pursuing responsible
Arctic region stewardship, and strengthening international cooperation.
These three objectives will be guided by four main principles: safeguard
peace and stability, make decisions using the best available
information, pursue innovative arrangements, and consult and coordinate
with Alaska Natives.

Industrial development of the Outer Continental Shelf

The [[state]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [fed]{.mark}eral
[gov]{.mark}ernment both [support]{.mark} responsible
[development]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [oil and gas]{.mark}
deposits]{.underline}, even as [**[they disagree on the strategies to
attain such development]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Regional and national
actors and voters are [[split on]{.mark} the [value of oil and
gas]{.mark} development [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline},
but many may not realize that the Alaskan Arctic already hosts numerous
oil and gas development projects. The state has authority to permit oil
and gas development within its lands and waters (up to three miles from
shore), and [the [Northstar development complex]{.mark} is an [example
of federalist approach]{.mark}es [to]{.mark} [development]{.mark}, as
both the state and the federal government were involved in the
assessment and permitting process]{.underline}. More recently, projects
put forward in Alaska's coastal waters have been developed using
horizontal drilling technology that allows producers to maintain
facilities adjacent to shore, on artificial islands. [This [type of
development]{.mark} has [seemed **more acceptable to local communities
and tribal organizations**]{.mark}, which also likely realize the
determination the state has to proceed with development.]{.underline}
The [larger battles have been waged over development in federal waters,
partially due to the fact that there are more avenues of legal
contestation (i.e., veto points) in federal permitting
schemes.]{.underline} Coordinating development in federal waters is now
also addressed in national ocean policy and climate change adaptation
strategies. The state preference is to expedite permitting of offshore
development without a framework for ocean governance, as a way to
maximize operational flexibility for oil and gas companies. The linkage
of these three policy areas, Arctic oil and gas, ocean policy, and
climate change adaptation, contrasts with the priority area the state
has emphasized in policy pronouncements: economic development.

This case also points toward coercive federalism in that rules relating
to resources on federal lands may effectively limit economic
opportunities for states. At the same time, any development that is
permitted that may affect protected resources (such as marine mammals or
endangered species) or that may affect the subsistence harvests of such
resources by Alaska Native hunters is also carefully evaluated. The
mitigation of risk to protected species and subsistence hunts are
comanaged between Alaska Native organizations and federal agencies,
pointing toward treaty federalism as well.

State influence over Arctic policy

The first federal policy to acknowledge the Arctic as a national
security priority was Richard Nixon's brief 1971 two-page National
Security Decision Memorandum 144. Since then the American Arctic has
been addressed in security policy through Ronald Reagan's 1983 National
Security Decision Directive 90, Bill Clinton's 1994 Presidential
Decision Directive 26, and George W. Bush's 2009 National Security
Presidential Directive 66/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25.
22 In 2009, President Obama reaffirmed his predecessor's Arctic policy
with the following six goals: (1) meet Arctic-specific national and
homeland security needs; (2) protect and conserve Arctic environments;
(3) ensure the environmental sustainability of natural resource
management and economic development; (4) strengthen institutions for
pan-Arctic cooperation; (5) involve Arctic indigenous communities in
'decisions that affect them'; and (6) enhance scientific monitoring and
research into cross-scale environmental issues.23

The policy also states what has become a consensus view at the Arctic
Council against a comprehensive treaty similar to the Antarctic Treaty
but calls for the assertion of American military and police power in
Arctic waters, in recognition of the geopolitics of sea ice retreat.
Additionally, the policy underscores the need to secure free passage
through the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route.24 The Obama
administration has been more proactive in Arctic issues than previous
administrations, sending Secretary of State Clinton to the 2011 Arctic
Council meeting in Greenland, agreeing to the 2011 Arctic Search and
Rescue agreement and contributing to the Marine Oil Pollution
Preparedness and Response plan, but there remain inefficiencies and
bureaucratic fragmentation of efforts across agencies relating to Arctic
policy.

Case studies of federalist challenges

Environmental assessment as a shared responsibility

Under the US regime for water quality, the 1972 Clean Water Act, [Alaska
shares responsibility for conserving the quality of
freshwater]{.underline}, estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems across
the state. The federal government and the state collaboratively manage
the regulatory requirements for reviewing, permitting, and evaluating
the environmental impact of development activities that affect these
water bodies. [One of the most [contentious development]{.mark}
[proposals]{.mark} facing regulators [is]{.mark} the potential [Pebble
Mine]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In 2007, mining giants Northern
Dynasty and AngloAmerican joined in a partnership to promote the
development of a potentially very large mine to excavate approximately
55 billion tons of copper, 67 million ounces of gold, and 3 billion tons
of molybdenum.15 The planning site for the mine covers 28 square miles
(7,252 hectares) of land that straddles two extraordinarily productive
rivers, the Nushagak and Kvichak. Both rivers flow into Bristol Bay, the
ecosystem that produces the top Pacific sockeye salmon fishery in the
world in terms of value and pounds of wild commercial fish.16 In 2010,
the fishery was worth over USD 500 million in annual income and
supported 12,000 fishing and processing jobs.17

[Significant numbers of [Alaskan]{.mark} coastal [communities]{.mark}
[depend]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the return of salmon to create a critical
economic component of household wealth]{.underline}. Subsistence
fisheries have been valued for the amount of grocery spending that is
offset by acquiring wild foods, but [the value of [subsistence
fisheries]{.mark} encompasses a way of life that is complex, and the
sustainability of those [communities relies on]{.mark} the [cultural
connection]{.mark} to the environment [as well as what it can
provide]{.mark}]{.underline}. For its part, Northern Dynasty and
Anglo-American (a corporation that later dropped its stake in the
project) have also released economic data estimating that the project
will produce 15,000 jobs each year, provide USD 18 billion in revenue to
local, state, and federal taxes, and result in USD 64 billion in
economic contributions to the US gross domestic product.18

In 2010, [regional [tribes]{.mark} and Alaska Native
organizations]{.underline} (including the regional Bristol Bay Native
Corporation) [[petitioned]{.underline}]{.mark} the Environmental
Protection Agency ([[EPA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[to conduct]{.mark} an
ecological [risk assessment]{.mark} of the area]{.underline} that would
likely be disturbed by large-scale mining. The agency reports that under
its assumed mine development scenarios, [significant amounts of
freshwater habitat for salmon and other species would be destroyed in
the immediate vicinity of the mine, and downstream habitat quality would
likely be diminished due to water quality impacts from mining production
wastes]{.underline}. The assessment does note that habitat destruction
could be potentially mitigated somewhat by careful siting decisions.

The assessment itself is somewhat of a departure from the way that
Alaska and the federal government share in the implementation of the
Clean Water Act, a legal framework for governing the release of
pollution (including mining wastes) into waterways and wetlands.
[[Alaska has]{.mark} the [authority]{.mark} [to issue permits]{.mark} to
allow particular developments to pollute surface waters under the Clean
Water Act]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, the [EPA retains the
authority to review permits]{.mark} that Alaska issues.]{.underline}
[The [size and scale of the mine]{.mark}, potentially the [largest
mining development in the world]{.mark} according to the EPA, [motivated
regional actors]{.mark} to ask the federal agency to prohibit
large-scale mining in the area.19 **[Instead]{.mark}, the [EPA
performed]{.mark} an ecological [risk assessment based on]{.mark} the
[resources]{.mark} in the area [versus]{.mark} the [impact]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} a [particular]{.mark} mining development
[plan]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The [State of [Alaska]{.mark}'s
Departments of Natural Resource and Law [expressed]{.mark} their
[disapproval]{.mark} of the ecological risk assessment
process]{.underline}, arguing that the [[EPA]{.underline}]{.mark} lacks
authority to conduct such an assessment and, ' \...
[[disregards]{.underline}]{.mark} federal and [[state laws]{.mark},
processes, and permits, the Statehood Compact, as well as the Alaska
Constitution'.]{.underline}20 The [[balancing act of federal and
state]{.mark} [power sharing]{.mark} in a case as divisive as the Pebble
Mine]{.underline} illustrates a key challenge of federalism. Part of the
tension comes from the EPA's concurrent roles of bureaucratic oversight
and evaluator of environmental justice issues with federally permitted
projects. In its analysis, the agency warns of the potential
environmental justice implications of the Pebble Mine if developed as
assumed by the agency, 'If salmon quality or quantity was (or was
perceived to be) adversely affected, the nutritional, social, and
spiritual health of Alaska Natives would decline.'21

The case reflects both types of federalism we have highlighted, coercive
and treaty federalism. The EPA maintains strict oversight (more or less,
depending on the administration's priorities) but is also bound by
treaty federalism to consult with tribal governments and intervene in
projects that disproportionately affect minority populations. In the
EPA's final analysis, the concern for ecological and cultural values
outweighed the potential for mining revenue and mining jobs as it
prepared to issue rules disallowing mining wastes from entering Bristol
Bay from the proposed Pebble Mine area.

The [[U.S. government ignored]{.mark} the [requests]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
some [Alaska Native]{.mark} [groups]{.mark} to uphold national Roadless
Rule restrictions in the Tongass National Forest, [tribal officials
said]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The U.S. Forest Service recommended lifting the rule completely and is
expected to make the decision official before the end of October,
CoastAlaska reported Friday.

The agency started a 30-day clock last month to completely exempt
Tongass National Forest from the 2001 regulation.

"[It's **[just another broken promise to tribes]{.mark}** as far as
we're concerned]{.underline}," [Hoonah Indian Association Administrator
Bob Starbard said.]{.underline}

The rule restricts but does not prohibit road building and resource
development on some national forest lands, while some critics said the
regulation locks up natural resources.

The [[federal government]{.mark} is [required to consult with tribal
governments]{.mark} before making changes to the rule]{.underline}. The
Forest Service consulted nine Southeast Alaska tribes whose traditional
homelands are part of the country's largest national forest.

[[Meetings, hearings and public comment periods]{.mark} dominated [by
Alaskans]{.mark} who favour keeping the rule intact [failed to
persuade]{.mark} Forest Service [officials]{.mark}]{.underline},
Starbard said.

"[The Tongass, which we sit in the middle of, is part and parcel of
being Tlingit. **We are people of the land**]{.underline}," Starbard
said. "[It became clear at the very end, however, that the [game had
already been fixed]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

Marina Anderson, administrator of the Organized Village of Kasaan on
Prince of Wales Island, said **[[tribal consultation]{.mark} was [not
taken seriously by federal officials]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"It was apparent that [our [participation]{.mark} --- [requested
by]{.mark} the [fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment in the throes of
this rulemaking process --- was a [form of box-checking]{.mark}, a [form
of]{.mark} the [gov]{.mark}ernment [saying]{.mark} that [they]{.mark}
had consulted with us properly and they [met with]{.mark} the
[Indigenous people properly]{.mark}]{.underline}," Anderson said.

The tribes' input "was integral to the agency's analysis during the
rulemaking process," U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Larry
Moore said in a statement.

U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and U.S. Rep. Don Young, both Alaska
Republicans, have criticized the Roadless Rule. Alaska Gov. Mike
Dunleavy, also a Republican, applauded the Trump administration's effort
to lift the rule.

Alaska's elected officials did not listen to the majority of residents
who oppose the Roadless Rule rollback, Anderson said.

"Alaska's delegation, this entire time, has had industry's best
interest, and they've been in full support of the exemption," she said.

[**market rewards** for **innovation**]{.mark} [would]{.mark} also [be

[[Federal climate **preemption**]{.underline}]{.mark} and unitary

**regulatory failure**]{.underline}, [**reversal risks**,]{.underline}
[and **political instability,**]{.underline} [such unitary preemptive
regimes [would **undercut** climate **progress**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[The more]{.mark} federal **climate regulation** or **future

all hopes for [climate progress]{.mark} would [rest]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
one [imperfect]{.mark} and vulnerable [fed]{.mark}eral

regulation and linked clean energy efforts **hedges** regulatory
**risks**]{.underline}. [Such **overlapping** and potentially
**intertwined** federal and state regulation may]{.underline}, somewhat
paradoxically, [be the most effective way to ensure that a future

implemented and endure despite ongoing political and legal
contestation.]{.underline}

In the meantime, [during times of **federal** policy **reversal** or

additional state **regulation** and **innovation** remains
important.]{.underline} [[States]{.mark}, alongside intermittent federal

[[Preserving **state**]{.mark} and **local [authority]{.mark}** despite
a federal **climate-change law** can serve as a]{.underline} partial
[**antidote** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} several [likely]{.underline}
forms of [**regulatory failure**]{.underline} discussed in Part I. [If
**federal law** proves to be **too lax** either in the level of its cap
or in the **rate of progress**]{.underline}, [state and local
governments]{.underline} could choose to [take **supplemental**, more
**stringent** actions]{.underline}. [These, concededly, would **burden**
those regulated more than under federal law alone. This **ability** of
state and local governments to take more **stringent
actions**]{.underline} could, nevertheless, [[prove **critical**]{.mark}
and **beneficial** in several respects]{.underline}. First,
[[widespread]{.mark} [state]{.mark} and local [actions]{.mark} could
[reduce]{.mark} the nation's **aggregate [emissions]{.mark}**, thereby
leading to **environmental progress** despite what might be an unduly
lax federal law]{.underline}. Second, [[a **groundswell** of]{.mark}
**additional** and possibly **different** [state]{.mark} and local
[climate-change efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} could, once again, [[play a
**critical role** in **catalyzing support** for]{.mark} additional or
amended **federal [legislation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.94 [Industry
hoping to avoid too many diverse state and local initiatives might
support federal legal change]{.underline}. [[If state]{.mark} and local
actors [were]{.mark} **legally [precluded]{.mark}** [from
action]{.mark}, then **[progress]{.mark}** could **[falter]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the **states-as-[catalyst dynamic]{.mark}** [would be
lost]{.mark}]{.underline}.95

In addition, [federal law]{.underline} could [fail if a lack of
**monitoring** and **enforcement** destroyed the **integrity** of the
new carbon-allowance marke]{.underline}t. [Empowering [state]{.mark} and
local government[s]{.mark} [to play their own]{.mark} supplementary
[roles]{.mark} in **enforcing** the law could be the equivalent of
[add]{.mark}itional **cops on the beat**]{.underline}.96 [With [**higher
rates** of **monitoring**]{.mark}, **[detection]{.mark}** of
**violations**, [and **punishment**]{.mark}, [rates of **compliance**
would]{.mark} likely [increase]{.mark}]{.underline}. Correspondingly,
[retaining overlapping and cooperative state and local climate
regulation roles would result in state and local governments continuing
to gain GHG regulation expertise]{.underline}. [With that experience
might come ideas for ways to improve federal law]{.underline}.97 If at
the end of the period of preemptive federal cap-and-trade exclusivity
states desired to initiate their own additional GHG regulation and
trading regime, the start-up hurdles would be less formidable.

[Preserving [state]{.mark} and local [climate roles]{.mark} would also
leave room to [engage in]{.mark} **policy [innovation]{.mark}** [and
**experimentation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.98 A [federal cap-andtrade
regime might prove highly effective, but additional measures are sure to
be needed.]{.underline} Apart from the broadly shared goal of creating a
liquid and thriving carbon-trading market---a goal assisted by a single
federal trading market---many other [[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}
could also [[prove effective in reducing GHG]{.mark}
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pollution trading is a promising way to
find cost-effective means to meet a pollution goal but, by definition,
does not prod polluters to extend beyond the cap's required aggregate
reductions. [Numerous other regulatory strategies can also help reduce
GHG emissions, as they have long helped address other environmental
ills.]{.underline} The optimal mix of mandates, technology forcing,
incentive-based tools such as taxes and subsidies, site-specific
imposition of rigorous performance goals, among many other strategies,
is not yet known. [Giving state and local governments **latitude** to
**experiment** serves to **diversify** the risks posed by a single,
**federal regulatory monopoly**]{.underline}. Even a trading regime
could benefit from different state or regional experiences in setting up
their own markets. The several state and regional carbon-trading regimes
in place at this time utilize somewhat different strategies.99 Provided
that the tradable GHG allowances and credits are sufficiently uniform to
facilitate trades across jurisdictional borders, the content and
institutional arrangements under cap-and-trade regimes would likely also
benefit from allowing diverse strategies; [[the **fed**]{.mark}**eral
regime**, [other states]{.mark}, and]{.underline} possibly [**other
[nations]{.mark}**, [all]{.mark} could [learn]{.mark} [by
comparing]{.mark} the efficacy, in actual implementation, of diverse
[approaches]{.mark} to GHG regulation and even cap-and-trade regulatory
strategies]{.underline}.

[[State]{.mark} and local government[s]{.mark} also provide **additional
venues** in which **citizens** and **stakeholders** can participate and
[**nudge governments** and **polluters** to
**improve**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Federal regulatory venues can be
invaluable, but different sorts of participation and input, often at
lower cost, may be facilitated by preservation of state and local
government roles. Similarly, [federal actors may be uninterested in
smaller-scale subjects of regulation that could easily be reached at
more local levels]{.underline}. Hence, state [and local regulatory roles
could serve to **enhance participation** while also filling in
**regulatory gaps** left in **federal law**.]{.underline}

[Even without federal error, reliance on a single regulator poses high
risks of stasis. The **regulatory temptation** to take an action and not

look-back**, **creation** of **regulatory "hammers"** incentivizing
**regulatory reexamination**, and **imposition** of **statutory
deadlines**]{.underline}.100 [Any regulatory reexamination poses risks
of revealing imprudence, error, and ineffective regulation]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [recent precedents greatly strengthen government defenses
to lawsuits intended to address agency inaction]{.underline}. Unless
either an enabling act grants a particular cause of action to address
inaction or a law mandates "required" and "discrete" actions, courts
cannot prompt an agency to act.101

State influence over Arctic policy

The first federal policy to acknowledge the Arctic as a national
security priority was Richard Nixon's brief 1971 two-page National
Security Decision Memorandum 144. Since then the American Arctic has
been addressed in security policy through Ronald Reagan's 1983 National
Security Decision Directive 90, Bill Clinton's 1994 Presidential
Decision Directive 26, and George W. Bush's 2009 National Security
Presidential Directive 66/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25.
22 In 2009, President Obama reaffirmed his predecessor's Arctic policy
with the following six goals: (1) meet Arctic-specific national and
homeland security needs; (2) protect and conserve Arctic environments;
(3) ensure the environmental sustainability of natural resource
management and economic development; (4) strengthen institutions for
pan-Arctic cooperation; (5) involve Arctic indigenous communities in
'decisions that affect them'; and (6) enhance scientific monitoring and
research into cross-scale environmental issues.23

#### Alaska is [substantially]{.underline} more capable of leading exploration and development, putting its Indigenous leaders at the [forefront]{.underline} of the development rather than the [federal government.]{.underline}

In his first hours back in office, President Trump signed a series of
executive orders aimed at unlocking Alaska's resource potential. This
signaled to the world what many Alaskans have long known: The road to
American prosperity, security and global leadership runs through the
49th state.

This renewed federal attention is not only welcome --- it's long
overdue.

[With growing incursions by Russian and Chinese forces into Alaska's
waters and airspace, America's northernmost state is no longer a distant
outpost; it is the front line of a new global contest.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the Arctic itself is changing. [Warming oceans are opening
new trade routes. Rival nations are racing to stake claims and build
presence.]{.underline}

Yet while Moscow and Beijing have poured billions into Arctic
infrastructure and military expansion, the U.S. has been dogged by
underinvestment and, until now, a lack of serious engagement.

[[Alaska]{.mark} is the [game-changer]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our
[[vast]{.mark} [reserves]{.mark} of oil, gas, coal, and critical
minerals]{.underline} --- including copper and rare earth elements ---
are [essential to reducing U.S. dependence on hostile foreign
suppliers]{.underline}. Its [Arctic geography makes it indispensable to
our [national defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [its communities,
industries and **[Alaska Native leadership are ready to meet]{.mark}
this [historic moment]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

That's why [[more than 100 of Alaska's]{.mark} business and [community
leaders]{.mark} [representing]{.mark} [oil]{.mark} and gas,
[mining]{.mark}, fisheries, [tourism]{.mark}, [forestry]{.mark},
transportation, construction [and Native]{.mark} corporation[s]{.mark}
have [come together]{.mark}]{.underline} to deliver a unified message to
Washington: Alaska is poised to deliver on the promise of William H.
Seward when he pressed the U.S. to purchase the state from Russia in
1867. To use the state's untold resource wealth and strategic advantage
for the benefit of the U.S.

[Now is the time. We are ready. [Let **us** lead]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This isn't abstract patriotism. It's a blueprint for national strength.
According to a national poll from Public Opinion Strategies,

73 percent of Americans support reducing reliance on China by tapping
Alaska's resources.

77 percent back expansion of national security infrastructure in Alaska.

64 percent support development of Alaska's critical minerals --- rising
to 70 percent when informed of the state's vast reserves.

77 percent trust Alaska's environmental safeguards more than foreign
producers.

These numbers reflect bipartisan common sense. Alaska is not asking for
a handout. We're asking for federal policies that unlock our ability to
serve the nation. Policies grounded in science and strategy, not
ideology.

Already, the shift is underway. Federal agencies are revisiting stalled
development projects. Congress is debating investment in Arctic ports
and military assets. And the White House has recognized the urgency,
with new executive orders prioritizing domestic energy and mineral
development, many of them with Alaska squarely in mind.

But momentum alone is not enough. We need commitment and partnership.

[We need recognition that Alaska's role in the national interest goes
far beyond beautiful images and nature documentaries]{.underline}. It is
a state that feeds the world with its fisheries, powers the economy with
its energy and connects America to the Arctic, where the next great
power competition is already underway.

We also need to tell the full story. [Alaska's Native communities are
uniquely established with corporations that invest to benefit their
Indigenous shareholders.]{.underline} The [people who have lived in
Alaska since time immemorial stand at the forefront of responsible
development, advancing projects that blend innovation and science with
traditional knowledge and environmental stewardship]{.underline}.

[In Alaska, we don't see development and conservation as mutually
exclusive, but as complementary forces working in tandem]{.underline}.

William H. Seward called Alaska the "last star added to the American
flag." Today, it must become the first place America looks to solve the
biggest challenges of our time: economic instability, resource scarcity
and global insecurity.

[The [U.S. cannot win the race for energy independence]{.mark},

/cblasi

Although the exercise of foreign affairs in the United States is
generally the prerogative of the federal government, [[states]{.mark}
and localities [possess considerable]{.mark} [authorities to engage in
foreign policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Michael Glennon and Robert
Sloane have detailed, [[states **enter into agreements with foreign
countries**]{.mark},]{.underline} **[[adopt international
standards]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [tax]{.underline} and/[or set
incentives for foreign business and **[make foreign policy
statements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, among other international activities.
[[States]{.mark} and localities]{.underline} also engage in a wide range
of foreign policymaking---by [[set]{.mark}ting climate change
[policies]{.mark}, [securing]{.mark} locally administered
[elections]{.mark} [from foreign interference]{.mark} and [battling
public health crises]{.mark} like the coronavirus pandemi]{.underline}c.
These are all, in a broad sense, a form of "foreign affairs federalism."
State and local authority to engage in these activities is derived
largely from state "police power." Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution, all powers that are not expressly delegated to the federal
government are reserved for the states and the people. [States exercise
this authority either by enacting their own legislation or by delegating
their power to counties, cities, and other localities to enact laws and
policies that preserve and protect the safety, health and welfare of the
community]{.underline}. During a public health emergency, states and
localities may also exercise extraordinary public health powers, as seen
across the country in confronting the pandemic, though the contours of
that authority are still being hashed out in the courts. Many other
central foreign policy powers are reserved for the federal government
and, in some cases, expressly withheld from states. For example, states
generally may not enter into treaties or engage in war absent
congressional consent. And the president is vested with the authority to
"speak or listen" on behalf of the nation on international affairs
matters. The federal government might also preempt states from
exercising certain foreign affairs powers, though the scope of the
doctrine is disputed and remains largely unresolved. [Even so,
[states]{.mark} and localities [possess foreign affairs
authorities]{.mark} that [have become even **more evident** due

**Bloom 2024** \[Nat, 20 November, 2024, Massachusetts Daily Collegian,
"The untold suffering of Alaska's Indigenous women,"
https://dailycollegian.com/2024/11/the-untold-suffering-of-alaskas-indigenous-women/,
acc 6/12/2025 mae\]

A smoke screen fortified by the U.S. government and judiciary system has
blinded society. This illusion promotes the supposed idea that because
of recent progress in securing rights, job equity and educational
opportunities, women no longer experience discrimination. However, this
narrative ignores the harsh reality. The [same systems that claim to
protect women's rights intentionally perpetuate their
suffering]{.underline}. [Nowhere is this more evident than in our
treatment of Indigenous communities, where Native women suffer from
countless acts of sexual violence that rarely are
addressed.]{.underline}

[[Alaskan Indigenous]{.mark} communities [contain]{.mark} some of the
**[highest rates]{.mark} of sexual [assault]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
These injustices that Indigenous women face stem from Alaska's resource
allocation. [[Alaskan Native villages]{.mark} have village officers,
separate from America's regular law enforcement]{.underline}. Sadly,
[this system fails Indigenous communities, as they [can't]{.mark} afford
to [pay quality officers]{.mark}, often [leaving them to hire]{.mark}
individuals with [criminal]{.mark} record[s]{.mark}, [including]{.mark}
even **[registered sex offenders]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As a result,
[these [communities]{.mark} [rely]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [VPSOs]{.mark}
which are government-provided officers.]{.underline}

Nonetheless, the [[Alaskan government doesn't hire]{.mark} nearly
[enough VPSOs]{.mark}]{.underline}, and currently, [Indigenous villages
are at an all-time low]{.underline} with "42 today." [Instead of
investing more money and resources to support struggling Indigenous
villages, the **[Governor of Alaska proposed cutting \$3 million]{.mark}
in funding [from]{.mark} the [VPSO]{.mark} program
budget.**]{.underline} This decision aims to avoid raising taxes and
keep costs low for citizens while **[[intentionally imposing]{.mark}
[inadequate safety resources in Indigenous
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Alaska spends the seventh highest amount on police and corrections in
the United States, suggesting that [the [state]{.mark} may well
**[consciously underfund ]{.mark}**]{.underline}law enforcement in
[**[Indigenous communities]{.mark}** [to keep taxes lower]{.mark},
despite having the ability to provide these communities with adequate
resources]{.underline}. [[Indigenous]{.mark} [women live]{.mark} [in
constant]{.mark} [fear]{.mark} as men prey on them without consequence,
a [situation rooted in Alaska's]{.mark} government's [failure to]{.mark}
[allocate]{.mark} adequate [protection]{.mark} resources [to Indigenous
villages]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The judiciary system plays a significant role in perpetuating Indigenous
suffering. In 1885, Congress passed the Major Crimes Act, which is still
active today. The act enabled the federal government to exercise
authority over Indigenous populations by overseeing and prosecuting
crimes, such as rape, committed by Native individuals within their
communities. The federal government took over most rape cases, excluding
tribal jurisdiction, often prosecuting fewer of them. There are many
unsolved cases and Indigenous women continue to suffer. The federal
government has failed to act and perpetuates the cycle of injustice
within Indigenous communities.

Another instance in which the U.S. justice system perpetuates Indigenous
women's suffering is through the Supreme Court's decision in Oliphant v.
Suquamish, which is still in effect today. It's important to recognize
that at least 86 percent of perpetrators in rape cases targeting
Indigenous women are nonnative men. Oliphant v. Suquamish is a decision
that eliminated tribal criminal jurisdiction over anyone who is not a
member of a federally recognized tribe. Prosecution of nonnative abusers
has suffered as a result. [Indigenous women are forced to live in
environments without any legal protection.]{.underline}

The United States is often acknowledged as a remarkable nation,
unmatched by others. However, we have overlooked the atrocities
committed by our government and justice system, particularly how the
U.S. leverages these powers to perpetuate sexual violence in Indigenous
communities. From the very beginning of American history, Indigenous
communities have faced oppression and injustices, with rape being a
prominent issue largely unreported in the media. It is crucial to
acknowledge Native American suffering and take a stand against the
terror enforced by the U.S. government and justice system. Educating
ourselves about these issues is an essential first step toward fostering
change.

We also find evidence that [[**budget-constrained** states
**decrease**]{.mark} the number of **resource-intensive** [on-site
inspections]{.mark} at large RCRA facilities while [increasing]{.mark}
the number of lower-cost [off-site inspections]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Many of the [off-site inspections are]{.mark} records
review]{.underline}s, [which determine whether the facility has met the
**regulatory requirements** for financial or other types of record
keeping]{.underline}. [Such **inspections** may be [**less effective**
in **detecting**]{.mark} regulatory [**violations** that]{.mark} would
have a **direct [impact]{.mark}** on human health and [the
**environment**]{.mark} than on-site compliance
evaluations]{.underline}. If so, [then a potential **worrisome
consequence** of this **substitution** is poorer **environmental
outcomes** in states with **shrinking environmental
budgets**]{.underline}.

Due to data limitations on monitoring and enforcement efforts at small
quantity generators and other "non-large" RCRA facilities, we are unable
to examine the impacts of decreases in state budgets at those
facilities. However, [given that there is no **formal guidance**,
**minimum standards**, or **oversight** on **monitoring** at these
facilities, it seems likely that]{.underline} [decreases in state
budgets would have]{.underline} similar, if not [greater]{.underline},
[impacts on agency efforts towards them]{.underline}. [While one might
be **tempted** to **dismiss** such impacts at these "non-large"
facilities as being **inconsequential**, given the **large number** of
such facilities]{.underline} (over 300,000 across the U.S.) [[the
**aggregate effect** on **environmental quality**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[could be]{.underline} **[[substantial]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Under the Trump administration [there was **significant devolution** of
**responsibility** for **environmental protection** to
states]{.underline}. In 2018, EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler stated
that "States and tribes have the primary role in state- and
tribalimplemented federal programs, and the EPA will generally defer to
states and tribes in their day-to-day activities" (Wheeler, 2018). It is
unclear whether this trend will continue under the Biden administration
or whether we will see a reversal. The [**[results]{.mark}** of our
**analysis** [suggest]{.mark} the potential for [**further decreases**
in state **environmental monitoring**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[enforcement efforts]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [a consequent decrease in
**environmental quality**]{.mark} in]{.underline} some
[areas]{.underline} [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Biden]{.mark}
Administration]{.underline} [were to [continue to **devolve**]{.mark}

show ALEC\'s secret plan to fight Biden on climate\"; Grist;

Republican efforts to stall President Joe Biden's climate agenda are
slowly beginning to take shape. In March, a coalition of [[12 Republican
state attorneys]{.mark} general filed a lawsuit challenging Biden's
[e]{.mark}xecutive [o]{.mark}rder creating a working group to establish
a metric for the "social cost of carbon." Led by Missouri's attorney
general]{.underline}, Eric [Schmitt, [the lawsuit charges]{.mark} that
[the order is an]{.mark} "enormous [expansion of federal]{.mark}
regulatory [power]{.mark}]{.underline}" and that such cost calculations
are "inherently speculative, policy-laden, and indeterminate" and should
instead be undertaken by Congress. In a similar vein, [[21
Republican]{.underline}]{.mark}-controlled
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}, led by Texas and Montana, have
[[sued]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} administration over its decision to
revoke a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, [calling it an
**unconstitutional overuse** of]{.mark}]{.underline} executive [[power
that would diminish the states']{.underline}]{.mark} economies and tax
revenue. Both lawsuits are pending in federal courts. Separately, in
response to Biden's alleged "hostility to the energy industry," Texas
Governor Greg Abbott issued an executive order in January directing
state agencies to "use all lawful powers" to challenge federal policies
that disadvantage oil and gas operators. (Texas state agencies with the
ability to loosen environmental regulations on the oil and gas industry
largely do not appear to have changed policies in response to the
order.) Ultimately, many of these actions may amount to little more than
grandstanding, and it's difficult to discern whether or not a broad,
deliberate strategy is at work. But behind the scenes, call records
obtained by Grist show that the American Legislative Exchange Council,
or ALEC, has formed a new working group to build upon these efforts. On
a one-hour call with ALEC members in late February, [former Utah state
representative]{.underline} Ken [Ivory claimed]{.underline} that each
directive in [the president's]{.underline} January [executive
order]{.underline} on climate action [unduly entrenched federal power
and stripped authority from the states]{.underline}. He surfaced fears
that Biden will declare a national "climate emergency" that "unlocks
more than 130 unilateral executive actions." (It's unclear how Ivory,
who did not respond to Grist's request for comment, arrived at that
figure.) Ivory also faulted the Democratic administration for promoting
climate-focused policies within federal agencies through executive
orders, rather than routing all proposals through Congress. "[We're
seeing something that [they're identifying]{.mark} as [a **new age in
climate federalism**]{.mark},]{.underline}" Ivory said. The call was the
first of two that have taken place so far as part of ALEC's new
Functional Federalism Working Group, which exists separately from a
longstanding ALEC task force on federalism and international relations.
The new group hasn't been publicized on the ALEC website beyond two
brief mentions in blog posts penned by Ivory. Its name suggests that the
group is meant to redress what Ivory described as an imbalance of power
between Biden's presidency and state governments, a majority of which
are dominated by conservatives. "What's the reasoning or the exact
strategy for them in creating this secretive working group, we still
don't know," said David Armiak, a research director with the Center for
Media and Democracy, a nonprofit government watchdog group that tracks
ALEC's initiatives and provided Grist with a verbatim record of the two
recent calls. "Fossil fuel and pharmaceutical companies do still play
leadership roles and very active roles in sponsor meetings, and they're
worried about some of these executive actions." A spokesperson for ALEC
did not respond to Grist's requests for comment.
[[ALEC]{.underline}]{.mark} is a membership organization for state
lawmakers and industry representatives that is best known for drafting
model bills that are then picked up by state legislatures. Its [[bills
have been linked to]{.mark} a number of [state laws **discouraging clean
energy**]{.mark}]{.underline} and criminalizing protests against
pipeline projects. ALEC's efforts to block climate progress, combined
with its alliance with right-wing groups that explicitly promote climate
change denial, has led major corporations such as ExxonMobil, Royal
Dutch Shell, Microsoft, and Google to cut ties with the group. While
it's still too early to tell exactly what shape opposition to the Biden
administration's climate proposals will take, the ALEC calls provide a
few indications. On the calls, Ivory floated three potential ways for
state lawmakers to present a united front against the Biden agenda:
nullification, or passing state legislation to invalidate federal
actions that states believe are unconstitutional; the initiation of a
constitutional convention that would pass amendments giving states more
power; and the passage of non-binding resolutions reaffirming the U.S.
Constitution's Tenth Amendment, which declares that powers not
explicitly granted to the federal government belong to the states, in
state legislatures. "The states have to be able to speak with one
voice," Ivory said. "As John Adams said, 'The clocks all have to strike
at one.'" [[Political scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} who spoke to Grist
doubted the likelihood of a constitutional convention or nullification
actions, but they [[cautioned against]{.mark} underestimating the
effects of passing resolutions at the [state]{.mark} level and
discussing [ways to **wrest power** from the federal
government]{.mark}.]{.underline} "They're providing the intellectual
scaffolding for this elite movement," said Jacob Grumbach, a University
of Washington political science professor who has studied ALEC closely.
[The moves are symbolic and help unify disparate camps within the
conservative movement]{.underline} --- from anti-abortion groups to
pro-gun groups and fossil fuel interests --- [by highlighting the shared
benefits of more power at the state level]{.underline}, he said.
