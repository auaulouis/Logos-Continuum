The **[[funding supports]{.mark} convenings of [Arctic Indigenous
Peoples in]{.mark} dialogues intended to guide international,
high-profile [Arctic research planning]{.mark} processes]{.underline}**
[-- specifically the 4th International Conference on Arctic Research
Planning (ICARP IV) and 5th International Polar Year (IPY 5) --
[in]{.mark} their development of [more inclusive, equitable,
Indigenous-led, and Indigenous Knowledge-centered Arctic research
protocols]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our [application was co-developed
through a series of informal online dialogues with several groups of
Arctic Indigenous knowledge hold]{.underline}ers prior to submission,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** [we were also honoured to receive formal
letters of [support from]{.mark} three Arctic Indigenous Peoples'
organizations: **[the I]{.mark}nuit [C]{.mark}ircumpolar
[C]{.mark}ouncil**, the Saami Council, and the Aleut International
Association.]{.underline}

Our **[[activities]{.mark} to date and their positive reception have
[exceeded expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The NSF grant allowed us
to host three events -- a standing-room-only presentation and two
convenings with over 30 Arctic Indigenous Knowledge holders -- at the
2023 Arctic Circle Assembly (ACA) in Reykjavík, Iceland. [[Indigenous
participants]{.mark} in these dialogues [shared]{.mark} their **[clear

Indigenous Knowledge must be represented and valued in all Arctic

Simonsen, Site Manager of the Kujataa UNESCO World Heritage site in
Greenland, also [shared the concerns of many in the Arctic about
increasing "research fatigue" when these principles of respect and
collaboration with Indigenous Knowledge holders are not recognized or
practiced.]{.underline}

Another critical outcome of the two ACA convenings was the development
of an Indigenous-led formal letter to the President of International
Arctic Science Committee (IASC) who serves as the Chair of the ICARP IV
International Steering Committee, emphasizing the interest of Arctic
Indigenous Peoples in having opportunities for equal voice in the ICARP
IV research priority-setting process. While the ICARP IV process already
includes Arctic Indigenous Peoples organizations as founding members of
the International Steering Committee, [the letter asked that the process
further elevate Indigenous representation in highest-level
decision-making]{.underline}. [This was a new request and has been well
received]{.underline} by the ICARP IV leadership, [launching several
excellent conversations and ongoing dialogues]{.underline}.

8 \| CONCLUSION: RECOVERING INDIGENOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO A TROUBLING
GEOGRAPHICAL ENTERPRISE

This article has provided further evidence for the [increasingly
recognised fact that Indigenous peoples contributed various types of
knowledge to the geographical discipline throughout its historical
development]{.underline}. As [[ongoing]{.mark} research is making clear,
the vital [role played by Indigenous peoples in]{.mark} the historical
formation of [knowledge]{.mark} about our world has
**[regularly]{.mark}** been **[silenced, obscured or
ignored]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Martin, 2020). Here, Nocum provided Dall
with various forms of geographical knowledge pertaining to the
Indigenous inhabitants of the Beringia region. Yet [[Dall
avoided]{.mark} giving the [impression of]{.mark} an [overreliance
on]{.mark} this [Indigenous informant due to]{.mark} the
**[risk]{.mark}** it may have [**posed** to]{.mark} his own
**[intellectual authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark} [he **[invoked racist arguments to
diminish]{.mark}** the **[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Nocum\'s
claims [and called into question his intellectual authority while at the
same time increasing and bolstering his own status as a reliable and
credible scholar]{.underline}. Nocum\'s role in providing this
information was thus carefully manipulated within Dall\'s retelling of
these events which has meant his [contributions have been omitted within
historical retellings of the 'origin of the Inuit' debates.]{.underline}
This and similar processes have therefore resulted in the skewed
understandings of the historical emergence of the geographical
discipline as we understand it today.

More importantly though, [the article has identified the [**racist and
imperialist logics** bound up in these]{.mark} historical
[debates]{.mark}.]{.underline} As both Smith (2021) and Livingstone
(2008) have made clear, debates on human origins have regularly resulted
in profoundly problematic and often erroneous conclusions regarding
human difference, and the debates pertaining specifically to Inuit were
no exception. Yet [such debates nonetheless played a powerful role in
fomenting and reproducing problematic depictions of Arctic
inhabitants]{.underline}, de[pictions which were then disseminated
across wider scholarship and which in turn shaped public
understandings.]{.underline} Dall\'s writings undoubtedly played a part
in reproducing these troubling racialised imaginaries of Arctic peoples
and only now is his large body of work beginning to receive due critical
interrogation.

As a final point, it is vital to remember that the **[[colonial
knowledge-making practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** discussed here
**[[cannot be separated from]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the various forms
of **[colonial violence]{.mark}** that were to be **[exerted]{.mark}**
up[on]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Indigenous peoples of the Arctic]{.mark} on
both sides of the Bering Strait in the years that followed.]{.underline}
The [various forms of scholarly knowledge pertaining to Arctic
Indigenous peoples produced and circulated during this period had direct
and far-reaching consequences for how contemporary and future colonial
regimes enacted their political power across the Boreal
regions]{.underline} (Stern & Stevenson, 2006). **[As is becoming ever
more evident, the historical legacies of geographical, anthropological
and archaeological [investigations in the Arctic are]{.mark} intimately
[intertwined with]{.mark} histories of [colonial dispossession, imperial
control and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Kulchyski, 1993; Rud, 2017;
Tester & Kulchyski, 2011). [The ways in which [colonial knowledge
regularly led to]{.mark} the **[dispossession]{.mark}** of land and
territory, the forced relocation of entire communities, [and]{.mark}
facilitation of various forms of **[physical, psychological and
epistemic harm]{.mark}** toward the peoples of the circumpolar north are
now beginning to be exposed]{.underline} (see, for example, Damas, 2002;
de Leeuw, 2007; Harris, 2020; Loo, 2019; McLean, 2020). The insights
offered by this article seek to support ongoing scholarship that is
investigating, critiquing and destabilising the various colonial and
racist projects that were enacted in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions
during this period (Barnd, 2017; Coulthard, 2014; Daigle, 2016; Deloria,
1997; de Leeuw, 2016; Smith, 2012; Louis, 2007).

### 1NC\-\--AT: Arctic BioD

#### Newest research shows the Arctic is [beyond saving]{.underline}.

**Carrington 23**, environmental editor (Damian, 06/06/2023, "Too late
now to save Arctic summer ice, climate scientists find," The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/too-late-now-to-save-arctic-summer-ice-climate-scientists-find)

[[It is]{.mark} now [**too late** to save]{.mark}]{.underline}
summer **[[Arctic]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark}]{.underline}**, research has
shown, and scientists say [[preparations need to be made for the
increased **extreme weather**]{.mark} across the northern hemisphere
that is likely to occur]{.underline} as a result.

Analysis shows that [**[even if]{.mark}** **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as
[emissions are **sharply reduced**]{.mark}, [the Arctic will be
**ice-free**]{.mark} in]{.underline} September in coming
[decades]{.underline}. The study also shows that if emissions decline
slowly or continue to rise, the first ice-free summer could be in the
2030s, a decade earlier than previous projections.

The research shows that 90% of the melting is the result of human-caused
global heating, with natural factors accounting for the rest.

Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has shrunk by
13% a decade, in one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Arctic
sea ice reaches its annual minimum at the end of summer, in September,
and in 2021 it was at its second lowest extent on record.

"**[Unfortunately it has become too late]{.underline}** to save Arctic
summer sea ice," said Prof Dirk Notz, of the University of Hamburg,
Germany, who was part of the study team. "As scientists, [we've been
warning]{.underline} about the loss of Arctic summer sea ice [for
decades]{.underline}. This is now the first major component of the Earth
system that we are going to lose because of global warming. People
didn't listen to our warnings.

"This brings another warning bell, that the kind of projections that
we've made for other components of the Earth system will start unfolding
in the decades to come."

Other climate scientists said [in [2022]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the
world [was]{.mark} on [the brink]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **multiple
[disastrous tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Prof Seung-Ki Min, of Pohang University, South Korea, who led the new
study, said: "The most important impact for human society will be the
increase in weather extremes that we are experiencing now, such as
heatwaves, wildfires and floods. We need to reduce CO2 emissions more
ambitiously and also prepare to adapt to this faster Arctic warming and
its impacts on human society and ecosystems."

[In 2021]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change ([IPCC) concluded that the Arctic would not lose its
summer ice if emissions were cut sharply]{.underline} and global
temperature rises were limited to 2C. [But **the [new
research]{.mark}**]{.underline}, published in the journal **[Nature
Communications]{.underline}**, [[projects]{.mark} the [loss of]{.mark}
summer sea [ice]{.mark} in the 2050s [in the low emissions
scenario]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\--AT: Warming

#### China, Russia, India emissions are all alt causes.

**No [catastrophic]{.underline} warming.**

Ronald **Bailey 22**. Science writer and author of multiple books,
citing Roger Pielke, Jr., Professor of Environmental Studies at the
University of Colorado, "Worst-Case Climate Change Scenarios Are Highly
Implausible, Argues New Study," 2/9/22,
https://reason.com/2022/02/09/worst-case-climate-change-scenarios-are-highly-implausible-argues-new-study/

Before rushing to kit out your climate prepper bunker, you might want to
take a look at **[[the new study]{.underline}]{.mark}** by University of
Colorado climate change policy researcher Roger Pielke that
[[confirms]{.underline}]{.mark} what the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change found in August 2021, namely [that [the worst-case
climate scenario is]{.mark} **increasingly
[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and that [while [our future will be
warmer]{.mark}, **it will [not]{.mark} be [catastrophically
so]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

These [[**dire predictions** were]{.mark}]{.underline} based on
calculations [[derived from a scenario]{.mark} of the future [in
which]{.mark}]{.underline} fossil fuel and agricultural
[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} over the course of this century [[would
boost]{.mark} atmospheric [carbon]{.mark} dioxide [to]{.mark} nearly
[1,400]{.mark} parts per million]{.underline}
([[ppm]{.underline}]{.mark}) [by 2100]{.underline}. The current level of
atmospheric carbon dioxide is just under 420 ppm, and that is up from
the pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm. Largely as a result of this
increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, global
average temperature has risen to around 1.1°C above the pre-industrial
level.

Climate researchers labeled this worst-case scenario \"RCP8.5,\" and it
has been somewhat updated in the new Intergovernmental Panel of Climate
Change\'s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) on the physical science
basis of climate change and given a new moniker of SSP5-8.5.

The IPCC\'s AR6 report, released in August 2021, now acknowledges that
\"[[the likelihood of high emission scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} such
as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} considered
[**[low]{.mark}** in light of recent developments in the energy
sector]{.underline}.\"

The recent developments in the energy sector to which the AR6 report
refers are that [[fossil fuel usage is]{.mark} likely to be [**fairly
flat** for the next 50 years]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the main ways
that the RCP8.5 scenario goes off the rails of plausibility is that it
projects a six-fold rise in global coal consumption per capita by 2100.
Since [future coal consumption is likely to remain flat or
decline]{.underline}, that means that global carbon dioxide emissions
will be \"approximately in line with the medium RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and
SSP2-4.5 scenarios.\"

For some years now, University of Colorado climate change policy
researcher Roger Pielke, Jr., and his colleagues have been pointing out
that [the development of [the global economy is **highly unlikely** to
trace]{.mark} the high [emissions pathways that led to]{.mark} [the
worst]{.mark} projected [outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
climate studies based on the RCP8.5 scenario are the ones being relied
upon by people making their predictions of dire climate calamity by the
end of this century.

Pielke and his colleagues have published a new study in the journal
Environmental Research Letters that argues that these [intermediate
emissions scenarios are **much more plausible** than the high end
scenarios that engendered fears of climate catastrophe]{.underline}.
\"These scenarios project between 2 and 3 degrees C of warming by 2100,
with a median of 2.2 degrees C,\" they conclude. They do, however,
acknowledge that \"these scenarios also indicate that the world is still
off track from limiting 21st-century warming to 1.5 or below 2 degrees
C.\"

These new calculations are based on the future energy use and energy
policy projections found in the International Energy Agency\'s latest
World Energy Outlook report. That report concludes that, instead of
rising six-fold, [global [coal consumption will peak]{.mark} during this
decade]{.underline}. On the other hand, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration projects that world coal consumption will continue to
rise slightly through 2050, but that\'s still far from the sixfold
increase entailed in the RCP8.5 scenario.

To assess plausibility of most of the IPCC scenarios, Pielke and his
colleagues ask which of the scenarios have projected carbon dioxide
emissions growth errors and divergences of less than 0.1 or 0.3 percent
per year over the observed growth rates between 2005 and 2020. That is,
[which scenarios tracked what actually happened with carbon dioxide
emissions over the last fifteen years?]{.underline} Next [they further
parse how well the scenarios similarly track actual emissions beginning
in 2005 through]{.underline} the IEA\'s [projections of future emissions
to 2050]{.underline}.

The chart above displays the plausibility of the various IPCC emissions
scenarios by tracking how well they match likely cumulative emissions of
carbon dioxide over the course of this century. The scenarios that
closely track actual and projected IEA emissions are marked with blue
dots (0.1 percent) and triangles (0.3 percent). \"**[[All]{.mark} of the
[plausible scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" explains Pielke in his
Substack newsletter The Honest Broker, \"[[envision less than 3
degrees]{.mark} Celsius total warming by 2100]{.underline}. In fact, the
median projection is for 2100 warming of 2.2 degrees Celsius.\" He adds
that that \"is within spitting distance of the Paris Agreement goal of
holding temperatures to a warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius.\"

Under the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, signatories committed to
\"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\"

So man-made global warming of 4°C by 2100 above pre-industrial levels is
not a real possibility.

\"Is the world ready for **[[good news on
climate]{.underline}]{.mark}**?,\" asks Pielke. Yes, we are.

CLIMATE TRENDS

[Beyond exhibiting **extreme overconfidence** [in]{.mark} a
**[cherry-picked analysis]{.mark}** of climate-change
causes]{.underline}, politicians and [[activists]{.mark} frequently
[ground]{.mark} their [**alarmism** in **frightening
predictions**]{.mark} about consequences that are likewise **far from
certain**]{.underline}. This is not only true within the very new (and
still quite unreliable) field of predictive climate science; it is true
even in the context of ongoing climate phenomena. Indeed, politicians
and [journalists frequently characterize dramatic]{.underline} or
unusual [climate phenomena as the product of anthropogenic climate
change, [yet there is **little ev**]{.mark}idence [to support]{.mark}
those [claims]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For one thing, [[there is no]{.mark} observable upward [trend in]{.mark}
the number of ["hot" days]{.mark} between 1895 and 2017; 11 of the 12
years with the highest number of such days occurred before
1960]{.underline}. Since 2005, [NOAA has maintained the]{.underline}
U.S. [Climate Reference Network]{.underline}, comprising 114
meticulously maintained temperature stations spaced more or less
uniformly across the lower 48 states, along with 21 stations in Alaska
and two stations in Hawaii. They are placed to avoid heat-island effects
and other such distortions as much as possible. [The **reported data**
show **no increase** in average temperatures over the available
2005-2020 period. In addition, [a]{.mark} recent [reconstruction
of]{.mark} global **[temp]{.mark}**erature[**s** over]{.mark} the past
**[1 million years]{.mark}** --- created using data from ice-sheet
formations --- [shows]{.mark} that there is **[nothing unusual]{.mark}**
about the current warm period]{.underline}.

Rising sea levels are another frequently cited example of impending
climate crisis. And yet [sea levels have been rising since at least the
**mid-19th century**]{.underline}. This rise is tied closely with the
end of the Little Ice Age that occurred not long before, which led to a
rise in global temperatures, some melting of sea ice, and a thermal
expansion of sea water. There is some evidence showing an acceleration
in sea-level rise beginning in the early 1990s: Satellite measurements
of sea levels began in 1992 and show a sea-level rise of about 3.2
millimeters per year between 1993 and 2010. Before 1992, when sea levels
were measured with tidal gauges, the data showed an increase of about
1.7 millimeters per year on average from 1901 to 1990.

But because the [datasets are from]{.underline} two [different
sources]{.underline} --- satellite measurements versus tidal
gauges --- they are not directly comparable, [and]{.underline} therefore
they [cannot be interpreted as showing an acceleration in sea-level
rises]{.underline}. Moreover, [the period beginning in]{.underline}
19[**93** is short in terms of global climate phenomena]{.underline}.
Since sea levels have risen at a constant rate, remained constant, or
even fallen during similar relatively short periods, [inferences drawn
from them are **problematic**]{.underline}. It is of course possible
there has been an acceleration in sea-level rise, but even still, it
would not be clear whether such a development stemmed primarily from
anthropogenic or natural causes; clearly, both processes are relevant.

[A study of changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice yields **very
different** inferences]{.underline}. Since 1979, [[Arctic]{.mark} sea
[ice]{.mark} has [declined]{.mark}]{.underline} relative to the 30-year
average (again, the degree to which this is the result of anthropogenic
factors is not known). [[Meanwhile, Antarctic]{.mark} sea ice [has been
**growing**]{.mark}]{.underline} relative to the 30-year average, [and
the [global sea-ice]{.mark} total has **[remained]{.mark}**]{.underline}
roughly **[[constant]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1979.

[Extreme weather occurrences are likewise used as evidence of an ongoing
climate crisis, but again, a **study** of the **available data**
undercuts that assessment]{.underline}. U.S. [tornado activity
shows]{.underline} either [no increase]{.underline} or a downward trend
since 1954. [Data on tropical storms, hurricanes, and accumulated
cyclone energy]{.underline} (a wind-speed index measuring the overall
strength of a given hurricane season) [reveal little change since
satellite measurements of the phenomena began in the early]{.underline}
19[**70s**. The number of wildfires]{.underline} in the United States
[shows no upward trend]{.underline} since 1985, [and global acreage
burned has **declined**]{.underline} over past decades. The Palmer
Drought Severity Index shows no trend since 1895. And the IPCC's Fifth
Assessment Report, published in 2014, displays substantial divergence
between its discussion of the historical evidence on droughts and the
projections on future droughts yielded by its climate models. Simply
put, the available data do not support the ubiquitous assertions about
the causal link between greenhouse-gas accumulation, temperature change,
and extreme weather events and conditions.

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- [climate
catastrophists]{.underline} will often [turn to **[dire
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline} about prospective climate phenomena.
[The problem]{.underline} with such predictions [is]{.underline} that
[they [are]{.mark} almost always [generated by]{.mark} climate [models
driven by **highly complex**]{.mark} **sets of [assumptions]{.mark}**
about which there is **significant dispute**. Worse, these models are
[**notorious** for **failing**]{.mark} to accurately predict already
documented changes in climate]{.underline}. As climatologist Patrick
Michaels of the Competitive Enterprise Institute notes:

> [[During **all periods**]{.underline}]{.mark} from 10 years
> (2006-2015) to 65 (1951-2015) years in length, [the [observed
> **temp**]{.mark}erature trend [lies in the]{.mark} **lower half**
> of]{.underline} the collection of [climate model simulations, and for
> several periods it lies very close]{.underline} (or even below) [the
> **[2.5th percentile]{.mark}** of all the model runs]{.underline}. Over
> shorter periods, such as the last two decades, a plethora of
> mechanisms have been put forth to explain the observed/modeled
> divergence, but none do so completely and many of the explanations are
> inconsistent with each other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that [almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- [**[overstate]{.mark}** past
and current temperature [trends by a **factor of**]{.mark} **two to
[three]{.mark}**, and at times **even more**]{.underline}. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, [every]{.underline} CMIP [climate model
predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas
should create an enhanced heating effect in]{.underline} the
mid-troposphere [over the tropics]{.underline} --- that is, at an
altitude over the tropics of about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying
climatology is simple: Most of the tropics is ocean, and as increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations warm the Earth slightly, there should be
an increase in the evaporation of ocean water in this region. When the
water vapor rises into the mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing
heat. And [yet]{.underline} the [satellites cannot find this heating
effect --- a reality suggesting that our understanding of climate and
atmospheric phenomena is **not as robust** as many seem to
assume]{.underline}.

[The **[poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark}** of mainstream climate
models [is **exacerbated** by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC
and U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} **highly
[unrealistic]{.mark} future [increases]{.mark}** in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. [The [average]{.mark}]{.underline} annual
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} under RCP8.5 [[is]{.mark} over [five
times]{.mark} the [annual]{.mark} average]{.underline} for 2000-2019
[and almost four times the single biggest increase on
record]{.underline}. Climatologist Judith Curry, formerly of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, describes such a scenario as **[["borderline

RCP6 is certainly more realistic. It predicts a temperature increase of
3 degrees Celsius by 2100 in the average of the CMIP models. But on
average, those CMIP models overstate the documented temperature record
by a factor of at least two. [Ultimately, models with a **poor record**

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- [climate
catastrophists]{.underline} will often [turn to **[dire
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline} about prospective climate phenomena.
[The problem]{.underline} with such predictions [is]{.underline} that
[they [are]{.mark} almost always [generated by]{.mark} climate [models
driven by **highly complex**]{.mark} **sets of [assumptions]{.mark}**
about which there is **significant dispute**. Worse, these models are
[**notorious** for **failing**]{.mark} to accurately predict already
documented changes in climate]{.underline}. As climatologist Patrick
Michaels of the Competitive Enterprise Institute notes:

[[During **all periods**]{.underline}]{.mark} from 10 years (2006-2015)
to 65 (1951-2015) years in length, [the [observed
**temp**]{.mark}erature trend [lies in the]{.mark} **lower half**
of]{.underline} the collection of [climate model simulations, and for
several periods it lies very close]{.underline} (or even below) [the
**[2.5th percentile]{.mark}** of all the model runs]{.underline}. Over
shorter periods, such as the last two decades, a plethora of mechanisms
have been put forth to explain the observed/modeled divergence, but none
do so completely and many of the explanations are inconsistent with each
other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that [almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- [**[overstate]{.mark}** past
and current temperature [trends by a **factor of**]{.mark} **two to
[three]{.mark}**, and at times **even more**]{.underline}. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, [every]{.underline} CMIP [climate model
predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas
should create an enhanced heating effect in]{.underline} the
mid-troposphere [over the tropics]{.underline} --- that is, at an
altitude over the tropics of about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying
climatology is simple: Most of the tropics is ocean, and as increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations warm the Earth slightly, there should be
an increase in the evaporation of ocean water in this region. When the
water vapor rises into the mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing
heat. And [yet]{.underline} the [satellites cannot find this heating
effect --- a reality suggesting that our understanding of climate and
atmospheric phenomena is **not as robust** as many seem to
assume]{.underline}.

[The **[poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark}** of mainstream climate
models [is **exacerbated** by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC
and U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} **highly
[unrealistic]{.mark} future [increases]{.mark}** in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. [The [average]{.mark}]{.underline} annual
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} under RCP8.5 [[is]{.mark} over [five
times]{.mark} the [annual]{.mark} average]{.underline} for 2000-2019
[and almost four times the single biggest increase on
record]{.underline}. Climatologist Judith Curry, formerly of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, describes such a scenario as **[["borderline
impossible."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

RCP6 is certainly more realistic. It predicts a temperature increase of
3 degrees Celsius by 2100 in the average of the CMIP models. But on
average, those CMIP models overstate the documented temperature record
by a factor of at least two. [Ultimately, models with a **poor record**
of successfully accounting for past data and **highly unrealistic**
future greenhouse-gas concentrations should **not be considered a
reasonable basis** for future policy formulation]{.underline}.

**'****Existential' warming is the [worst case]{.underline} that [even
the IPCC]{.underline} thinks is [highly]{.underline} unlikely AND
[every]{.underline} model is [ruined]{.underline} by systemic [upward
bias]{.underline}.**

Upward Bias in Temperature Forecasting Models

[The prospect of a coming [catastrophe]{.mark} for humanity and the
biosphere [rests **heavily** on]{.mark} outputs of climate forecasting
[**models**. But]{.mark}]{.underline} as David Legates and co-authors
argue, [[these]{.mark} models "[exhibit]{.mark} a **[strong
exaggeration]{.mark}** in their results even when narrowly adopting
atmospheric carbon dioxide as the sole driver of climate responses....
\[General circulation models, such as]{.underline} those of [the
IPCC]{.underline}, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\] [have
**consistently overestimated**]{.underline} the [climate
sensitivity]{.underline} to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide."

Ross McKitrick (2020) begins his assessment, "[Two new peer-reviewed
papers from independent teams confirm that climate models overstate
atmospheric warming, and the problem \[of overstatement\] has gotten
worse over time, not better]{.underline}". One of the papers (by
McKitrick and John Christy) examined 38 models, the other, 48 models,
used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the
various US "National Assessments", the EPA's "Endangerment Finding", and
more.

McKitrick continues, "Both [papers looked at
**'hindcasts'**]{.underline}, which are [reconstructions]{.underline} of
[recent historical temperatures]{.underline} in response to observed
greenhouse gas emissions and other changes (eg aerosols and solar
forcing). Across the two papers it emerges that [the [models
**overshoot**]{.mark}]{.underline} historical warming from the
near-surface through the upper troposphere, in the tropics and
globally." The study based on 48 models for 1998 to 2014 found that
[they warm]{.underline} *on average 4 to **[[5
times]{.underline}]{.mark}*** [faster than the
observations]{.underline}.

McKitrick concludes, "[modelling]{.underline} the climate [is incredibly
difficult]{.underline}, and no one faults the scientific community for
finding it a tough problem to solve. But we are all living with the
consequences of [climate modelers **stubbornly** using **[generation
after generation]{.mark}** of models that [exhibit **too much**
**surface** and **tropospheric** warming, in addition to]{.mark} running
[**grossly exaggerated** **forcing**]{.mark} **scenarios**]{.underline}
(eg RCP8.5).

"\[[W\]hen the models get the]{.underline} tropical [**troposphere**
wrong, it drives]{.underline} potential [errors in]{.underline} many
[**other** features]{.underline} of the model atmosphere. Even if the
original problem was confined to excess warming in the tropical
mid-troposphere, it has now expanded into a more pervasive warm bias
throughout the global troposphere.

"[If]{.underline} the [[discrepancies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
troposphere [[were]{.underline}]{.mark} evenly [split]{.underline}
across models [between]{.underline} excess [warming and cooling we could
chalk it up to]{.underline} noise and [uncertainty. But that is not the
case: it's ***[all]{.mark}*** excess ***[warming]{.mark}***.... That's
***bias***]{.underline}*, not uncertainty, and until the modelling
community finds a way to fix it, the economics and policy making
community are justified in assuming future warming projects are
overstated, potentially by a great deal....*"

[The **[strong upward bias]{.mark}** in]{.underline} temperature
[forecasts relative to observations **[compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline}
the **[[models]{.mark}' forecasting impacts]{.underline}** on
ecosystems, including agriculture, [by **exaggerating** the probability
of catastrophic effects]{.underline}.

The [[IPCC]{.mark} makes projections]{.underline} of future global
temperatures to the end of century [based on]{.underline} various
[models]{.underline}. They range [from]{.underline} a low of [1.4 C
to]{.underline} a high of [5.6 C]{.underline} over pre-industrial
temperature (roughly 1900). [The [wide range makes them]{.mark} almost
**[meaningless]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The IPCC explains that the wide
range results from uncertainty about the magnitude of the feedback
between warming and increased rates of evaporation -- and David Seckler
adds, also about the effects of evaporation on clouds and precipitation.
(5)

It is astonishing to learn that the climate models miss a critical
component of the climate system \-- the hydrological cycle, and
specifically clouds, which the IPCC calls the "wild card" in the climate
system.

[The IPCC's **[Worst Case]{.mark}** Scenario [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
commonly [[used as]{.mark} the **[Business as
Usual]{.mark}**]{.underline} without a Radical Policy Action'
[Scenario]{.underline}

The IPCC's Assessment Report 5 (AR5), published in 2014, presented a
range of forecasts of global climate out to 2050 and 2100, based on
different assumptions about radiative forcing (a measure of how much of
the sun's energy the atmosphere traps). [The most extreme]{.underline}
-- the worst case -- [was called Representative Concentration Pathway
[(RCP) 8.5]{.mark}. It [assumes]{.mark} **ominous [reversals]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} several **[basic, long-standing trends]{.mark}**, all
heading in the extremely wrong direction to 2100:]{.underline}

- [high [population growth]{.mark}]{.underline} to reach more than 12
  billion people

- [[slow **tech**]{.mark}nology development]{.underline}

- [[coal]{.mark} consumption [increases]{.mark}]{.underline} by 500 %
  between 2005 and 2100 (no account taken of supply constraints)

- [[slow]{.mark} GDP [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}

- [[fast]{.mark} rise in world [poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}

- [[high energy]{.mark} use]{.underline}

- [high GHG [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- [**[temp]{.mark}**erature forecast: **[5 C]{.mark}** rise]{.underline}
  between 2005 and 2100.

[RCP 8.5's vision is **horrifying**]{.underline}, as worst-case
scenarios should be.

[[A **whole wave** of **lit**]{.mark}erature, in peer-reviewed journals
as well as in media, even by IPCC authors, has since [presented
this]{.mark} worst-case [as]{.mark}]{.underline} either "the most
**[[likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** case" or "the baseline case --
business as usual without policy action". This
**[[misleading]{.underline}]{.mark}** assumption provoked a recent paper
in Nature subtitled: "Stop using the worst-case scenario for climate
warming as the most likely outcome" (see also, Chrobak, 2020).

**The risk is [1 in 1000]{.underline} and not for
[millennia]{.underline}, so [intervening]{.underline} measures solve.**

Why Climate change is (probably) not a existential risk

Firstly, Toby Ord still acknowledges [[there is]{.mark} a **[1 in 1000
chance]{.mark}**s [of climate]{.mark} change [being]{.mark} an
**[existential]{.mark}** risks]{.underline}, so [the odds
are]{.underline} not 0. But it is [low enough to be
**negligible**]{.underline}.

While Ord did not go indepth in his analysis, in this highly detailed
document, researcher John [Halstead discusses all the potential ways
that a climate change can be an existential risk, and estimate the
likelihood of it happening]{.underline}. Using the Equilibrium climate
sensitivity and Earth system sensitivity measure, [he examines key
tipping points]{.underline}, such as the permafrost carbon release and
clathrate methane release, effect of mass extinction, ocean
acidification, heat stress, water stress, crop reduction and sea level
rise.

[[In **all** scenarios]{.mark} related to]{.underline} climate system
[feedback loops and tipping points]{.underline}, especially the ones
that are irreversible for millennia, [the [increase]{.mark} in
temperature [is]{.mark} actually **[negligible]{.mark}** compared to
human sources]{.underline} (for instance, [permafrost would cause only
an increase in 0.42 degrees Celsius by 2300 at the current rate) or
**unlikely**]{.underline} to happen based on our knowledge of what
happens in previous climate eras (eg. although Methane Clathrate could
release 50 Gigaton of carbon and cause a 1.75 degree Celsius increase,
[[it would]{.mark} probably [take]{.mark} centuries to
**[millennia]{.mark}**, during which humans could have [**enough time**
to **adapt** and **mitigate**]{.mark} the effect]{.underline}).

Other [indirect threats]{.underline} for existential threats
[were]{.underline} also [considered, but found to be **unlikely**.
[Species]{.mark} have [**adapted** to **much higher**]{.mark}
temperature [change in the **past**]{.mark}, and **[paleology]{.mark}**
has **[suggest]{.mark}**ed that [the]{.mark} **primary [cause]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} mass [extinctions were]{.mark} often due to **volcanic
[eruption]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} only the increase in [CO2.
**S**]{.mark}ea **[l]{.mark}**evel **[r]{.mark}**ise will increase [by

**managed**]{.mark} and **adapted**. Similarly, heat stress will be more
often, but there is already adaptations like air-conditioning, and water
stress can be **fixed** by desalination]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[**crop**s [yields]{.mark}]{.underline}, which was modeled by the IPCC
model at 5 degree of warming, would generally range from -20% to +10%
with adaptation. Furthermore, we [can expect
**[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline} in yield [[thanks to
**tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [such as gene editing, improvement

on]{.underline}.

#### Ocean absorption solves permafrost release.

**Moseman 22** \[Andrew Moseman, MIT Climate Portal Writing Team; Citing
Andrei Sokolov, Research Scientist at the MIT Department of Earth,
Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, "Will climate feedback loops push us
past a "point of no return"?," 10-04-22,
https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/will-climate-feedback-loops-push-us-past-point-no-return\]

The [basic mechanics of climate change are familiar: Burning fossil
fuels increases]{.underline} the amount of [heat-trapping greenhouse
gases]{.underline} in our atmosphere, causing the planet to retain more
heat. [However, the]{.underline} [climate system
is]{.underline} [**complex**, and changing the planet's temperature can
also change the natural world in ways
that]{.underline} [release]{.underline} [still more greenhouse
gases]{.underline}. These are feedback loops, or ways that global
warming can accelerate itself in a vicious cycle.

[Is it possible]{.underline} [these]{.underline} [feedback
loops]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [send us
past]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [point of no return]{.underline}---a
tipping point where humans no longer have the power to slow climate
change? [Not exactly]{.underline}, says
Andrei **[Sokolov]{.underline}**, [MIT research scientist and an expert
on climate sensitivity. Over longer time periods, he says,
the]{.underline} [Earth will]{.underline} **[balance itself
out]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} **[corrective
measures]{.underline}**, [such as the ocean]{.underline} **[absorbing
carbon dioxide]{.underline}** from the air. In the short term, though,
the warming effects of feedback loops may make our planet a decidedly
unpleasant place to live.

[What are these climate feedback loops? One example
is]{.underline} the [loss of ice]{.underline} [cover]{.underline} as
higher temperatures melt glaciers and reduce the amount of ice that
forms in the Arctic each winter. [Ice reflects]{.underline} lots
of [sunlight]{.underline} back into space and helps to cool the planet
(the "[albedo effect]{.underline}"), but when ice turns to darker
seawater, that effect is diminished. [Another example
is]{.underline} [water vapor]{.underline}: higher global temperatures
make more water evaporate from oceans, lakes, and rivers, which means
more water vapor is in the atmosphere trapping heat. [And climate change
already is causing more major wildfires,
which]{.underline} [release]{.underline} [the carbon stored in
trees]{.underline}.

[All these effects can reinforce and worsen Earth's warming
trend]{.underline}, Sokolov says. [But]{.underline} [**none**,
on]{.underline} [its]{.underline} [own,]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [**catastrophic**.
Ice]{.underline} [exists mostly in polar locations
that]{.underline} [don't
get]{.underline} [much]{.underline} [sunshine,]{.underline} **[dampening]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[albedo]{.underline}** [effect.
Fires release CO2 stored in forests, but]{.underline} [forests
regrow]{.underline} [and turn back into carbon "sinks"]{.underline} that
pull the greenhouse gas out of the air.

The most troubling feedback of all has to do
with **[permafrost]{.underline}**, soil that stays perpetually frozen.
Enormous amounts of carbon reside in the permafrost of far northern
places like Alaska and Siberia, in the form of both CO2 and methane
(CH4), a shorter-lived but more powerful greenhouse gas. Researchers
estimate there may be as much as 1,600 billion tons of carbon stored in
this permafrost. The Arctic region is warming faster than the planet on
average, and this effect could thaw the soil and release some or all
that carbon into the atmosphere.

Such an event [could significantly accelerate climate
change]{.underline}. To instantly release the entire cache would double
the amount of carbon now in the atmosphere, Sokolov says, causing a rise
in global temperatures of 3.5 degrees Celsius. This would blow past the
world's shared goal of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

While that frightening-sounding outcome is possible, Sokolov
says **[most]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[climate
models]{.underline}** [he
has]{.underline} **[studied]{.underline}** [show]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[much
more]{.underline}** **[gradual
release]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[permafrost]{.underline}** [carbon.
And, crucially,
the]{.underline} **[same]{.underline}** **[models]{.underline}** [show]{.underline} that
the **[oceans]{.underline}** [would be]{.underline} **[able to
absorb]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [carbon]{.underline} **[even if
permafrost]{.underline}** [released]{.underline} **[2,000
gigatons]{.underline}**, [more than the highest estimate]{.underline} of
what exists.

"In short," he says, "[I]{.underline} **[don't
think]{.underline}** [there is]{.underline} [a '**point of no
return**]{.underline}.' ... In simulations with large CO2 pulses,
the **[atmospheric
CO2]{.underline}** **[concentration]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[temperature]{.underline}** [still]{.underline} [**come
down**, primarily]{.underline} [due to]{.underline} **[carbon
uptake]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[ocean]{.underline}**."

#### Consequentialism is especially vital for native justice. 

**Waldron 92** \[Jeremy Waldron is University Professor at New York
University School of Law, and teaches legal and political philosophy. He
was previously University Professor in the School of Law at Columbia
University. ("Superseding Historic Injustice", Ethics 103.1, October

V. CONCLUSION *It is important that [defenders of]{.mark}* **[aboriginal
[claims]{.mark}]{.underline}** *[face]{.mark} up to the possibility of
the supersession of* **[[historic injustice]{.underline}]{.mark}***.*
Even if this particular thesis about supersession is mistaken, some
account has to be given of the impact on aboriginal claims and on the
reparation of generations- old injustices of the demographic and
ecological changes that have taken place. Apart from anything else, *the
changes that have taken place over the past two hundred years mean that
the* [**[costs]{.underline}** *of* **[respecting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
*primeval [entitlements are]{.mark}* **[much
[greater]{.mark}]{.underline}** *now than they were in 1800*. Two
hundred years ago, a small aboriginal group could have exclusive
domination of "a large and fruitful Territory" without much prejudice to
the needs and interests of very many other human beings. Today, such
exclusive rights would mean many people going hungry who might otherwise
be fed and many people living in poverty who might otherwise have an
opportunity to make a decent life. Irrespective of the occurrence of
past injustice, this imbalance would have to be rectified sooner or
later. That is the basis for my argument that claims about *[historic
injustice]{.mark} predicated on the status quo ante [may be
]{.mark}*[**[superseded]{.underline}** *by*]{.mark} *our determination
to distribute the* **[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** *of the world in
a way that is fair to all of its existing inhabitants*. *Behind the
thesis of supersession lies a determination to* **[[focus upon
present]{.mark} and prospective [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}***[---the
suffering]{.mark} and the deprivation* **[[over which we]{.mark} still
[have]{.mark} some [control]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The idea is that
*any conception of [justice]{.mark}* which is to be made practically
relevant for the way we act now *[must]{.mark} be a scheme that
[take]{.mark}s [into account ]{.mark}***[modern
[circumstances]{.mark}]{.underline}** *[and]{.mark} the way those affect
[the ]{.mark}*[**[conditions]{.underline}** *under which people*]{.mark}
**[presently [live]{.mark}]{.underline}** their lives. Arguments for
reparation take as conclusive claims of entitlement oriented toward
circumstances that are radically different from those we actually face:
claims of entitlement based on the habitation of a territory by a small
fraction of its present population, and *claims of*
**[entitlement]{.underline}** *based on the determination to ignore the
present* **[dispersal]{.underline}** *of persons and peoples on the face
of the earth, simply because the [historic]{.mark} mechanisms of such*
[**[dispersal]{.underline}** *were*]{.mark} *savagely implicated in*
[**[injustice]{.underline}***. And* **[yet, here
we]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[all [are.]{.mark}]{.underline}** *[The
present circumstances are]{.mark} the ones that are*
**[[real]{.underline}]{.mark}***: it is in [the ]{.mark}***[[actual
world]{.underline}]{.mark}** *that people starve or are hurt or degraded
if the demands of justice in relation to their circumstances are* **[not
met]{.underline}***. Justice*, we say, *[is]{.mark} a matter [of the
]{.mark}***[[greatest importance]{.underline}]{.mark}***. But the
importance to be accorded it is relative to what may actually happen if
justice ¡s* **[not done]{.underline}***, not to what might have happened
if injustice in the past had been avoided.*

**[caution]{.underline}**. While there is a temptation to consider that
people everywhere experience the same sense of 'no future', **[Mitchell
and [Chaudhury's]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2020) *[critique]{.mark} of
'new catastrophist'* (Urry, 2016) *writing [reminds us that]{.mark}*
**[affective [futurities]{.mark}]{.underline}** *[are a]{.mark} part of
larger [cultural]{.mark}* and historical *formations*. Their reading of
this literature shows that while the focus is on future catastrophes
that could bring about civilisational collapse, for many Black,
Indigenous and Peoples of Colour, the catastrophe is not in the future
but has already unfolded over the past five centuries. *[For
many]{.mark} such [groups]{.mark},* *their [futures were
]{.mark}*[**[foreclosed]{.underline}** *by*]{.mark} *the actions of*
[**[white settlers]{.underline}** *and colonisers*]{.mark} *in pursuit
of their own desired futures.* After all, the imagined futures of
European modernity told through stories of progress and utopia were
inextricably linked to imperial conquests. While ostensibly addressing
the fate of humanity in its entirety, (**[Mitchell and
Chaudhury]{.underline}** (2020: 319) *argue that this 'new*
**[catastrophist' literature]{.underline}** *consists of 'white
apocalyptic narratives' primarily concerned with preserving* **[European
ways of life]{.underline}** *and* commitments to Eurocentric *notions of
progress*. As Savransky (2021: 4) observes: 'the End of the World is
always the end of some world in this world \[. . .\] the Euro-American
extractive mode of living through which "civilization developed," is not
the end of everything as such'.

Accordingly, sociologists should understand that futurelessness is
always the foreclosing of some futures among other possible futures in
this world, and we need always to ask for whom are those futures
foreclosing and how is this made to matter. I have addressed a
particular European (or perhaps Euro-North American) kind of
futurelessness expressed by writers on the political left. But, as
Mitchell and Chaudhury (2020: 322) show, there are other futures
available, which they explore through Afrofuturist, Desi-futures and
myriad other non-European futurisms that 'open space for futures beyond
(the) apocalypse (of whiteness)'.

''**[[fetishist apocalypticism]{.underline}]{.mark}**' *. If we have
arrived*, as she argues, *at the end of the future* inherited from
modernity, *the challenge is to build a 'new present' out of the*
'*wreckage of old futures'*, reimagining what we mean by progress and
that the kinds of utopia possible that are no longer 'lands of endless
plenty' (Battistoni, 2013). *[Only by addressing]{.mark} the

ways of imagining possible futures*. As Battistoni (2013) observes,
**[climate change]{.underline}** *is the unintended outcome of a
'brighter future' that generations in Europe and North America* and more
recently elsewhere invested in to bring them and their children better
lives. Now it appears that there is no future in this future any more,
what new stories can and must be told?

can be detected in nuclear literature. Frequently *[it functions]{.mark}
not by* **[denying vulnerability]{.underline}**, *but---[like]{.mark}

not a* **[passive vulnerability]{.underline}** (or not necessarily so):
*it could be* **[impassioned]{.underline}** *and*
**[confrontational]{.underline}**.

Perhaps the most important dimension of 1980s nuclear environmental
peril was that, with the potential for global thermonuclear war meaning
that *[no-one was]{.mark}* **[[exempt]{.underline}]{.mark}** *from the
planet's nuclear fate, there emerged also the*
**[necessity]{.underline}** *of thinking* **[how our
[humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [*was* **[held in
common]{.underline}**, *above*]{.mark} *and beyond [political and
]{.mark}***[[national difference]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By
demonstrating the tendency of nuclear materials and consequences to pass
beyond geographical and political borders, *nuclear literature could ask
its readers to conceive of* **[nuclear war]{.underline}** *as an attack*
not so much on particular countries as *on the* **[whole
planet]{.underline}** and on all people.61 It could even sometimes offer
glimmers of non-human perspectives, challenging people to look beyond
the tracery of political and other boundaries around the globe, dividing
one human society from another. We will see later in the chapter, for
instance, how the migrations of birds in Terry Tempest Williams's Refuge
transcend human boundaries, weaving places together in different ways
and revealing both the fragility of the ecosystem (as vectors of
transmission span the planet) and the ephemerality and partiality of
human conceptions of the world.

*As the human species seemed to be* **[imperilled]{.underline}**,
*nuclear [literature]{.mark} sometimes also [called up
]{.mark}***[[shared notions of human identity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
*If such a human identity was opposed to anything it was to those who
threatened nuclear war, and thus*, as I have argued elsewhere, *there
was a shift in some antinuclear discourses from
"***[horizontal]{.underline}***" conceptions of*
**[conflict]{.underline}** (West against East) *to "vertical" ones* (in
which ordinary people in different countries were collectively
threatened by their leaders and the nuclear military machine).62 Such
*[globalised]{.mark} [constructions of]{.mark}*
[**[humanity]{.underline}** *are not*
**[unproblematic]{.underline}**]{.mark}---they might, for instance,
efface cultural differences whose starting points for understanding what
it is to be human are at odds with one another; *we may instinctively
react to them as naï***[vely utopian]{.underline}**; *[we may]{.mark}
even [disagree that]{.mark} it is [nuclear bombs]{.mark} per se*
**[which [are the problem]{.mark}]{.underline}***---[but they represent
an]{.mark} innervating and [exhilarating]{.mark} attempt to*
**[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}** *and reach [beyond
]{.mark}***[[destructive]{.underline}]{.mark}** *forms of*
**[[nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}***.*

The politics of **[vulnerability]{.underline}** is important to the
activism of 1980s nuclear literature as a *means of acknowledging,
indeed celebrating, the small and the vulnerable whose fates would
otherwise be passed over as insignificant*. *It was not merely that the
lives of individuals were threatened by nuclear technology, it was that
the effects of those [technologies]{.mark} were to [problematize
the]{.mark}* **[conceptual [categories]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}*by [which the ]{.mark}*[**[human]{.underline}** *was
understood*]{.mark}. Physical bodily boundaries separating self from
world seemed to dissolve, for instance, in the face of radiation or the
ingestion of radioactive fallout. *Even if free of dangerous
physiological contamination* (as most surely were), [*the mind could be*
**[penetrated]{.underline}**]{.mark} *and* **[haunted]{.underline}**
*[by]{.mark} nuclear* **[[anxieties]{.underline}]{.mark}**. *The natural
world through which human subjects moved seemed also to be compromised,
its ecosystems permeated by a* **[nuclear presence]{.underline}**. All
these things meant that *the coherence of the self*, the integrity of
body and mind, *seemed to be subject to malign forces moving across and
through it.*

8\. Global ethics must respond to mass extinction. In late 2014, the
Worldwide Fund for Nature reported a startling statistic: according to
their global study, 52% of species had gone extinct between 1970 and
2010.60 This is not news: for three decades, conservation biologists
have been warning of a 'sixth mass extinction', which, by definition,
could eliminate more than three quarters of currently existing life
forms in just a few centuries.61 In other words, [it could threaten the
practical possibility of the survival of earthly life. [Mass
extinction]{.mark} is not simply extinction (or death) writ
large]{.underline}: [it [is a **qualitatively different**]{.mark}
[phenomena that demands its own **ethical categories**]{.mark}. It
cannot be grasped by aggregating species extinctions,]{.underline} let
alone the deaths of individual organisms. [[Not only does it
erase]{.mark} diverse, irreplaceable **[life]{.mark}**
forms]{.underline}, [[their]{.mark} **unique [histories]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **open-ended [possibilities]{.mark}**[, but it **threatens
the ontological conditions of**]{.mark} **Earthly
[life]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

IR is one of few disciplines that is explicitly devoted to the pursuit
of survival, yet it has almost nothing to say in the face of a possible
mass extinction event.62 It utterly lacks the conceptual and ethical
frameworks necessary to foster diverse, meaningful responses to this
phenomenon. As mentioned above, Cold-War era concepts such as 'nuclear
winter' and 'omnicide' gesture towards harms massive in their scale and
moral horror. However, [they are asymptotic: [they imagine]{.mark}
nightmares of [a]{.mark} severely [denuded planet]{.mark}, yet they do
[not]{.mark} contemplate [the **comprehensive negation**]{.mark} that a
[mass extinction]{.mark} event [entails]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
contemporary IR discourses, where it appears at all, extinction is
treated as a problem of scientific management and biopolitical control
aimed at securing existing human lifestyles.63 Once again,
[[this]{.mark} approach [**fails to recognise** the **reality of
extinction**]{.mark}, [which is a **matter of being and
nonbeing**]{.mark}, not one of life and death processes.]{.underline}

[Confronting the enormity of a possible mass extinction event requires a
total overhaul of human perceptions of what is at stake in the
disruption of the conditions of Earthly life. The question of what is
'lost' in extinction has]{.underline}, since the inception of the
concept of 'conservation', [been addressed in terms of financial
cost]{.underline} and economic liabilities.64 Beyond reducing life to
forms to capital, currencies and financial instruments, the dominant
neoliberal political economy of conservation imposes a homogenising,
Western secular worldview on a planetary phenomenon. [Yet [the
**enormity**]{.mark}**, complexity, [and scale]{.mark}** [of mass
extinction is **so huge**]{.mark} that [humans need to **draw on every
possible** ]{.mark}resource in order [to **find** ways of
**responding**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This means that they need to
mobilise multiple worldviews and lifeways -- including those emerging
from indigenous and marginalised cosmologies. Above all, it is crucial
and urgent to realise that [[extinction is a **matter of global
ethics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is not simply]{.mark} [an issue
of]{.mark} management or security, or even of particular visions of
**[the good life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, it is about staking a
claim as to the goodness of life itself. If it does not fit within the
existing parameters of global ethics, then it is these boundaries that
need to change.
