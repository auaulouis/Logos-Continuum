## [Letter From The Editor]{.underline}

Worthwhile topic research is a hefty task for the experienced debaters
and coaches -- this is why many debate organizations have consolidated
topic research in the form of briefs. However, debate briefs cost
hundreds of dollars over the course of a year of topics, which can add
up quickly, especially for smaller programs just starting off. Some of
the best debaters in the country often spend thousands of dollars on
debate briefs and private coaches who have competed and coached debate
for decades that will strategize and research for them. This is a stark
comparison to a small school, which sometimes will not even have a
full-time debate coach. Debate is expensive enough without trying to
outcompete the best and brightest minds money can buy.

Money should never be the reason why someone's debate career is not
successful. Kankee Briefs hopes to eliminate those financial inequities
as much as possible by removing the research gap between those who can
afford private coaching, and those who can't. For the past six years,
we've released debate briefs for every NSDA topic, at no charge to
debaters.

## [Topic Analysis]{.underline}

### 1.1 Introduction

#### Introduction

Resolved: In the United States criminal justice system, plea bargaining
is just.

The Sept-Oct resolution is fundamentally one regarding whether plea
bargaining is bargain bin justice, prioritizing efficiency and
expediency over potential claims of fairness, evidentiary standards at
trial, and the avoidance of potential prosecutorial coercion. This
resolution is an inverse repeat of the 2018 Jan-Feb plea bargaining
topic (my second debate topic ironically), but the 2025 redux has aff
supporting maintain the status quo plea bargaining system and neg
supporting the abolition and/or major reform of plea bargaining in favor
of a trial system.

However, unless you routinely slumber to *CSI* or *Law and Order,* or
you had pre-existing contact with the criminal justice system, you're
likely suffering from the "what is this thing" phase of many topics.
This is oddly horrifying given that \~90-95% of people arrested will go
through the plea bargaining process they know virtually nothing about
and were likely not informed about in school (however, ironically, in
the process of you reading this, I may be negating my statement about
you not being informed about plea bargaining in schools). Aren't we
educated about our 6^th^, 7^th^, and 8^th^ amendment rights to a jury
trial, our 14^th^ amendment due process rights, etc.? One might ask,
what is plea bargaining?

plaintiff - The person who files the complaint in a civil lawsuit.
[plea]{.underline} - [In a criminal case, the defendant\'s statement
pleading \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" in answer to the charges in open
court]{.underline}. A plea of nolo contendere or an Alford plea may also
be made. [A guilty plea allows the defendant to forego a
trial.]{.underline} plea deal (or **[plea bargain]{.underline}** or
agreement) - [Agreement between the defendant and prosecutor where the
defendant pleads guilty in exchange for a concession by the prosecutor.
It may include lesser charges, a dismissal of charges, or the
prosecutor's recommendation to the judge of a more lenient
sentence.]{.underline} pleadings - Written statements of the parties in
a civil case of their positions. In federal courts, the principal
pleadings are the complaint and the answer.

Per the DOJ, plea bargains are more contractual and bargaining focused,
following the philosophy of "Let's Make a Deal" as opposed to the
traditional trial that is inclusive of due process, truth-seeking, and a
desire to prove guilt/non-guilt. A trial for both the prosecutor and
defendant are expensive, timely endeavors, which explains why in civil
court, parties routinely agree to a settlement or enter arbitration to
avoid a court proceeding.

However, a contractual settlement amongst equals in a free market is an
imperfect analogy to a criminal trial, as the stakes are *much higher,*
potentially involving life and death, and there's a major power
imbalance with you and your defense attorney compared to the prosecutor,
as you too are beholden to how willing the prosecutor is to work with
you. Unlike trials, the prosecutor is the most important actor. The
judge is minimally involved---with some counties outright banning judges
being involved given potential misconduct.

The prosecutor sets the baseline sentencing value, which can be
arbitrarily high due to his ability to add additional charges and apply
more punitive sentencing guidelines (see the charge bargaining and
sentence bargaining cards below for a more in-depth explanation). The
proposed punishment could be outrageously high, even including the death
penalty in some states, so often it's in the best interest of everyone,
including innocents, to bargain with the prosecutors to avoid the
greater punishment. The difference in punishment between the plea
bargain and the trial is often called the "trial penalty" or the "plea
discount."

One tack that the prosecution may take in the negotiation process is the
use of charge bargaining. Broadly, charge bargaining is the process
whereby the prosecution agrees to drop certain charges in exchange for
the defendant's guilty plea on other charges.95 In rare cases, the
prosecution and the defendant will come to an agreement under which all
pending charges against the defend- ant are dropped or no charges are
brought at all.96 Further, in some instances the prosecution will
withdraw certain charges against the defendant where the defendant would
face mandatory consequences in subsequent collateral pro- ceedings if
found guilty of the to-be-dismissed charges.97 However, in the more
typical case, the prosecution will agree to reduce the number of charges
brought, charge less serious offenses, or dismiss certain charges
against the defendant in exchange for the defendant's guilty plea.98
[Alternatively]{.underline} (and often [in conjunction with charge
bargaining]{.underline}), [the pros- ecution may]{.underline}
[employ]{.underline} **[sentence bargaining]{.underline}** [to encourage
the defendant to enter a guilty plea]{.underline}. Sentence bargaining
is the process whereby [the prosecution and defendant
agree]{.underline}, and the prosecution recommends to the court, that
[the defend- ant will receive a]{.underline} specified
[sentence]{.underline} or a sentence within a specified range, [which is
less onerous than the sentence that the defendant would have other- wise
received had he or she been found guilty following a
trial]{.underline}.99 With sen- tence bargaining, the prosecution has a
wide array of tools at its disposal. [The prosecution can
agree]{.underline} to recommend a particular sentence or particular sen-
tence range (in federal cases or states with analogous sentencing
guidelines), to suggest [that a sentence be reduced by a fixed
percentage, or to refrain from opposing a particular sentence requested
by the defendant]{.underline}.100 Finally, [the pros- ecution may offer
the defendant the possibility of using a particular section of a
sentencing guideline]{.underline} which, unlike the bulk of other plea
agreements,101 is binding on the sentencing court once it accepts the
bargained plea.102 In the process of negotiating the plea, United States
Attorneys (and other prosecuting authorities for that matter) "have wide
discretion in negotiating guilty pleas . . . ."103 One manner in which
[this discretion could be exercised is by withdrawing more serious
charges in exchange for a guilty plea even if the prosecution's case
against the defendant on the dropped charge is strong]{.underline}.104
However, at least in the federal jurisdiction, this typically does not
occur.105 In federal criminal trials, prevailing practice dictates that
United States Attorneys pursue negotiations that will produce a guilty
plea to the most serious charge provable by the prosecution. The United
States Attorney General set forth this principle in a 2010 memorandum as
follows: Plea agreements should reflect the totality of a defendant's
conduct. These agreements are governed by the same fundamental principle
as charging decisions: prosecutors should seek a plea to the most
serious offense that is consistent with the nature of defendant's
conduct and likely to result in a sustainable conviction, informed by an
individual- ized assessment of the specific facts and circumstances of
each partic- ular case. Charges should not be filed simply to exert
leverage to induce a plea, nor should charges be abandoned to arrive at
a plea bargain that does not reflect the seriousness of the defendant's
conduct.106 As alluded to above, the presiding trial judge, for the most
part, plays no role in the actual process of negotiating the plea. The
Federal Rules of Crimi- nal Procedure mandate that "the court must not
participate in \[plea bargaining discussions\]."107 As such, the judge,
at least in the federal system, is almost completely absent from the
actual process of determining (in negotiations) which charges a
defendant will plead guilty to, which charges the prosecution will drop,
and what sentence is appropriate.108 However, the judges retain the role
of manager of cases before the court and decide how much time to give
the parties to negotiate.109 Most importantly, the judge retains
ultimate control over whether to accept or reject the plea ultimately
produced as a result of the negotiations.110 As to the requirements that
the judge must adhere to when accepting or rejecting a plea agreement,
the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce- dure provide comprehensive
guidelines, and the federal guidelines are illustra- tive of what judges
must do in both the federal and state systems alike.111

#### Overview relation charge bargaining and incarceration -- involves three-step prosecutorial of "piling on" charges closely related to the crime, "overreaching" to add questionable, but threatening charges, and "sliding down" from the large sentence to a smaller one achievable via a guilty plea.

Against this received wisdom, this Article offers a different account.
Plea bargaining, it contends, appears lawless only if by "law" one
refers to those two familiar legal pillars of the American criminal
justice system--- substantive and constitutional criminal law---that
together consume aca- demic discussions, in classrooms and in legal
scholarship alike.9 Beyond those twin pillars, however, lies a third,
unseen but essential body of law that has long been obscured by some of
criminal justice scholarship's most familiar blind spots: It is a
creature primarily of state law (not federal law), of court rules and
statutes (not constitutional doctrine), and of procedures often seen as
relevant only to a bygone era of trial-based litigation (not to the
system of pleas that has replaced it). 10 And yet, as this Article will
show, it is this subconstitutional state law of criminal procedure---the
hidden law of plea bargaining---that time and again establishes the
mechanisms and legal frameworks through which prosecutorial plea
bargaining power is generated and deployed Take, for example, [charge
bargaining]{.underline}, the primary mechanism by which [prosecutors
control defendants' sentencing]{.underline} [exposure]{.underline}, and
[with]{.underline} it the so- called **[trial penalties]{.underline}**
[defendants face if they dare refuse a prosecutor's invitation to plead
guilty]{.underline}. Long [criticized as an illicit form of
coercion]{.underline}, charge bargaining presents a conundrum under the
traditional scholarly account: Given the breadth and depth of
substantive criminal law, [charge bargaining is routinely diagnosed as a
major driver of plea bargaining's pathology]{.underline};11 but given
prosecutors' constitutional authority---indeed, their
responsibility---to select the charges a defendant will face, it is also
seen as an inevitable feature of criminal law's administration. 12 If
one looks beyond substantive and constitutional criminal law, however,
charge bargain- ing's power dynamics become far more complex, for the
essential particulars of the practice---ranging from [the number of
charges the prosecutor can file, to their severity, to their
relationship to the defendant's sentencing exposure, to the ease with
which they can be traded away]{.underline}---all directly
[impact]{.underline} just [how much leverage the prosecutor truly
has]{.underline}. And crucially, those particulars are in turn dictated
by the subconstitutional procedural law of the states---an interlocking
set of legal frameworks that comprises the law of joinder and severance,
the law of preclusion, the law of cumulative sentencing, the law of
pretrial charge review, the law of dismissal and amendment, and the law
of lesser offenses.13 Almost entirely unexamined in existing plea
bargaining literature, these hidden legal frameworks address issues that
every system of criminal justice administration simply must resolve as
it determines, for example, how many charges can be filed in a given
case, or whether the sentences associated with those charges will run
concurrently or consecutively. And yet, the answers to these inescapable
questions, while necessarily shaping prosecutorial power, are neither
hardwired nor predetermined. Rather, the choice of which procedural
regime to adopt--- from a range of potential options---inherently, if
often implicitly, presents an important policy choice about how
prosecutorial plea bargaining power ought to be structured.14 As
Professor Kenneth Culp Davis explained half a century ago, that core
question poses one of the central challenges of governmental
administration: Too much discretionary power, and "justice may suffer
from arbitrariness or inequality"; too little, and "justice may suffer
from insufficient individualizing."15 In a pluralist criminal justice
system such as ours, no fixed formula can prescribe exactly the right
amount of prosecutorial power for every jurisdiction, as no two
communities confront the same challenges when balancing their citizens'
competing rights to liberty and security.16 And yet, as Davis
observed---and as a growing chorus of academics, activists, and
politicians from both parties now agree---too often our criminal justice
system gets that balance wrong, tolerating an unacceptable excess of
prosecutorial power, and with it an unacceptable excess of
incarceration, doled out in troublingly unequal ways.17 As recognition
of these systemic failings turns criminal justice reform into the
rallying cry of a generation, the need to understand the regulatory
levers hidden within subconstitutional procedural law---and to recognize
which [institutional actors are responsible for crafting these
regulatory regimes]{.underline}---grows only more significant.18 [For in
a system of pleas such as ours, in which nearly every sentence of
incarceration arises from a plea of guilt]{.underline}, [criminal
justice reform and plea bargaining reform are of necessity **one and the
same**]{.underline}.19 The central goal of this Article is thus to draw
this hidden law of plea bargaining into the open, subjecting it for the
first time to sustained scholarly analysis. 20 That analysis proceeds
here in five Parts. Part I begins by deconstruct- ing charge bargaining,
the central and most criticized mechanism of prosecutorial power, into
its three constituent components, which this Article terms piling on,
overreaching, and sliding down. Those components, in turn, form the
organizing framework for the three Parts that follow, Parts II, III, and
IV, which are the Article's core and which together offer its two
initial contributions: First, they excavate the complex and inter-
locking set of procedural levers that serve as charge bargaining's
hidden regulatory framework, analyzing how each lever can be deployed to
either facilitate or restrict prosecutorial power, depending on how its
accompanying procedural law is structured. Second, by surveying the
variety of procedural frameworks employed across the states, the Article
exposes the surprising degree of procedural---and thus regulatory---
heterogeneity currently in place, and thereby destabilizes assumptions
about where the boundaries of feasible reform might lie.21 With those
expanded horizons of potential reform in mind, Part V reflects on the
underlying practical and political forces of the current plea bargaining
regime, offering three final contributions: First, it provides a
concrete example of what a coordinated suite of subconstitutional
procedural reforms might look like. Second, it lays the foundation for
future empirical analyses of how these various procedural levers might
interact with broader sociolegal forces to impact plea bargaining
practices on the ground. Finally, it casts the underlying political
economy of plea bargaining in a new light, exposing a previously hidden
but ultimately central set of lawmakers: state courts, acting here not
in their familiar capacity as adjudicators deciding cases but rather in
a fundamentally distinct and ultimately surprising role---as
quasi-legislatures, responsible for crafting the heretofore hidden law
that governs our criminal justice system of pleas. I. THE HIDDEN LAW OF
CHARGE BARGAINING [The ability to control a defendant's sentencing
exposure by manipu- lating the charges against him]{.underline}---that
is to say, [the ability to charge bargain---is widely
recognized]{.underline} by scholars [as "the core of prosecutorial
power]{.underline} in the United States."22 The practice itself is
simple enough to describe: [A criminal defendant's sentencing exposure
is a function of his likelihood of conviction and his likely sentence if
convicted]{.underline}. [Those]{.underline} two factors, in turn,
[are]{.underline} heavily [influenced by the charges he
faces]{.underline}, [which define]{.underline} the possible grounds for
[conviction]{.underline}, the [maximum]{.underline}
[potential]{.underline} [sentence]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
frequently the [minimum sentence]{.underline} as well.23 [A charge
bargain is]{.underline} thus simply [an agreement to replace a higher
charge with a lower one in exchange for the defendant's promise to plead
guilty, which guarantees the prosecutor a conviction without the expense
of trial]{.underline}.24 Yet while such an exchange may sound like an
actual bargain, with each party gaining, to quote the Supreme Court, a
"mutuality of advantage" from the deal,25 most knowledgeable [observers
describe it as]{.underline} something else: [a fundamentally coercive
practice]{.underline} (occasionally [analogized to
**torture**]{.underline}) [that produces involuntary pleas, sometimes to
crimes the defendant did not commit]{.underline}.26 The core problem is
twofold. First, while defendants always want to minimize their potential
sentences, prosecutors rarely want to maximize them, hoping instead to
obtain only their preferred sentence, in the most efficient way
possible.27 This asymmetry allows [prosecutors]{.underline} to [trade
away "extra" years of incarceration that the defendant desperately wants
to avoid but that the prosecutor doesn't particularly
value]{.underline}. As for the second problem: This free leverage is
typically overwhelming, because [most criminal codes authorize sentences
much higher than what a typical prosecutor]{.underline}---or a typical
person, for that matter---[would]{.underline} actually [want to see
imposed in a given case]{.underline}.28 Thus, [by threatening a
seriously inflated set of charges and then offering to replace it with
the charges that she truly desires, the prosecutor is able to control
the defendant's incentive to plead guilty, and with it the outcome of
any subsequent "negotiation]{.underline}."29 In the aggregate,
[prosecutors so empowered can obtain more convictions, with longer
sentences, at lower costs---all preconditions for **mass
incarceration**]{.underline}.30 In practice, [charge manipulation
involves]{.underline} **[three]{.underline}** interrelated
[moves]{.underline}. First, [the prosecutor can inflate the quantity of
charges]{.underline} the defendant faces, [by]{.underline} **[piling
on]{.underline}** [overlapping, largely duplicative
offenses]{.underline}---[increasing]{.underline} with each new charge
the defendant's potential [sentence]{.underline}, his [risk of
conviction, and the]{.underline} "**[sticker shock]{.underline}**" [of
intimidation]{.underline} that accompanies a hefty charging
instrument.31 Second, [the prosecutor can achieve similar effects by
inflating the substance of the charges themselves, **overreaching**
beyond what the law, the evidence, or the equities of the case
support]{.underline}.32 Finally, after deploying these tactics to "jack
up the threat value of trial,"33 the [prosecutor]{.underline} can
[capitalize on the]{.underline} ensuing [leverage by]{.underline}
**[sliding down]{.underline}** [from her initial threat to the lower set
of charges that she actually prefers]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is the
difference between the threat and the subsequent offer that constitutes
the prosecutor's power: The larger the differential, the more likely the
defendant is to plead guilty---whether he is in fact guilty or
not]{.underline}.34 To make these three moves more concrete, consider a
straightforward example, to which we will return throughout the
discussion to follow: Imagine a defendant suspected of approaching
someone on a street corner at night, of pointing a gun at that person,
of ordering them to move a few steps to the left (out from under a
streetlamp), and, finally, of taking their wallet and running off with
it. To any lay observer, [the crime alleged here is]{.underline}
straightforward: [armed robbery]{.underline}. And yet, in practice[, a
prosecutor]{.underline} could and routinely [would]{.underline}
[commence]{.underline} a [prosecution]{.underline} against such a
defendant [by piling on a host of additional charges,
including]{.underline} (to list just some examples) [aggravated assault,
theft, threats, possession of a weapon, and using a firearm during a
crime of violence]{.underline}.35 Moreover, given the defendant's
alleged command to move out from under the streetlamp, [the]{.underline}
[prosecutor might]{.underline} also [overreach]{.underline}, [tacking
on]{.underline} the far more serious but [questionably applicable charge
of kidnapping]{.underline} for good measure.36 Finally, bringing her
leverage to bear, [the prosecutor would then offer to slide down from
these inflated charges to the charge that she]{.underline}--- and she
[alone]{.underline}---[deems appropriate]{.underline}, [based on her
personal assessment of the evidence and of the defendant's
culpability]{.underline}: [Plead guilty to a single count of armed
robbery]{.underline}, she tells the defendant---[or]{.underline}, even
more enticingly, to [misdemeanor]{.underline} [counts of theft and
possession of a weapon]{.underline}---and **[everything else will go
away]{.underline}**.37 As plea bargaining scholars consistently
recognize, prosecutorial charging discretion exercised in this fashion
"translates into power in the plea bargaining context."38 And yet this
is also the point at which plea bargaining scholarship starts to run
out, for it frequently assumes that such power is an intractable feature
of criminal justice administration in a system that does not (and
arguably cannot) tell prosecutors what charges to file in a given
case.39 The true scope of prosecutors' charge-bargaining power, however,
is contingent on much more than just the decision of what charges to
file, turning instead on a broader set of procedural questions: With
respect to piling on, how many charges can a prosecutor threaten and how
much will each additional charge increase the defendant's sentencing
exposure? With respect to overreaching, what standards must be satisfied
before substantively inflated charges can proceed beyond the filing
stage, and how will those standards be enforced ? With respect to
sliding down, what restrictions, if any, will be placed on the
prosecutor's ability to replace one set of charges with another? Too
often, these essential questions go overlooked---perhaps because their
answers are found not in the familiar constitutional law of criminal
procedure but rather in its unexamined counterpart: the
subconstitutional procedural law of the states. The following three
Parts excavate and analyze that unexamined body of law, mapping for each
of the three charge-bargaining components just described the mechanisms
by which prosecutors exercise their authority and the procedural law
through which that authority is structured. The following table gives an
overview of the discussion to come II. PILING ON

Assuming you're guilty, you get a better deal if you save everyone the
effort, avoid the due process in trials, and then because you saved the
justice system time and money, you'll be rewarded via the bargain
discount. However, in a glass half-empty view, you would have been
penalized for using your constitutional rights. Plea bargaining
proponents say you got off with a lower punishment then what was
deserved, while some neg authors have analogized this to a gunman
threatening you with bullets for brains if you don't hand over your
wallet, implying the plea decision was made under duress and no free
choice at all. Some behavioral psychology experiments have actually
tested plea bargain-like scenarios, finding that the best choice is to
minimalize risk and plead guilty, even if you're innocent, to be
guaranteed lower punishment.

To some degree, prosecutors with plea bargains are roughly analogous to
health insurance companies and hospitals. Both the plea bargain and the
discount cost from health insurance benefit from the fact that the
original, pre-discount number is extraordinarily large. A larger number
implicitly coerces people into signing up for health insurance or plea
bargain to avoid the uninsured medical costs or the trial penalty, both
of whom reflect the pre-discount price, and a larger discount from the
inflated larger number makes the discount seem more desirable. Simply
put, if your job performance is dependent on people being highly
encouraged to pick the discounted option (in the case of prosectors, the
quick-and-easy plea bargain), don't be surprised if they make the
original price less attractive to make the discounted option more
enticing by comparison.

#### Seemingly efficient plea bargains can cause retaliation for extra work and coercion out of threat of greater penalties

Suppose that defendant Henderson has been charged with armed robbery and
that the statutorily defined sentence range for such an offense is a
three- to six-year prison term. The lead prosecutor in the case comes to
Henderson (or, more likely, Henderson's attorney) and offers to
recommend a sentence at the low end of that range (say, three years) if
Henderson will agree to plead guilty. The prosecutor also assures
Henderson that she has spoken with the presiding judge in the case and
received assurances that the judge is willing to go along with such a
sentence recommendation. Against his attorney's advice, Henderson
declines to take the deal and insists on going to trial. He is convicted
by a jury and, post-trial, the prosecutor recommends a five-year
sentence to the judge which the judge accepts. On the face of it, it
would seem that the waiver reward in Henderson's case is two years and
that therefore, on the flipside, his trial penalty---the extra measure
of punishment Henderson receives because he elected trial adjudication
of the charge against him---is likewise two years. Yet this way of
looking at things obscures two different factors that might affect
Henderson's final sentence. To distinguish them, I borrow an analogy
from Kenneth Kipnis. In explaining what he took to be unjust about plea
bargaining, Kipnis employed an analogy involving a college professor who
engaged in grade bargaining.9Here is how grade bargaining works:
[Students submit papers to which the professor gives a cursory reading.
The professor]{.underline} then [tells students]{.underline} that [if
they]{.underline} will [waive their right to a more careful and thorough
reading of their papers, she will award them a better grade than her
cursory reading suggests is warranted]{.underline}. Suppose that student
[Thompson's paper appears to merit a grade of C based on the professor's
cursory reading. Thompson is offered a grade of B if she will waive her
right to a second reading of her paper]{.underline}. [If Thompson
refuses the grade proffer, she takes her chances with the professor's
more careful reading of her paper]{.underline}. It might turn out that
the professor will see virtues in (p.14) the paper that she missed the
first time, in which case she will assign the paper a better grade than
the C which she initially thought it deserved. It is even possible that
the second, more thorough reading will convince the professor to give
Thompson a grade of A on the paper. Obviously, Thompson risks losing out
on the A grade if she takes the professor's bargained grade proffer. But
it could also turn out that the professor's second reading of the paper
will confirm the cursory reading grade or, worse, will convince the
professor that the paper is a poorer effort than she initially believed
it to be. Many [students]{.underline}, [faced with the choice between
accepting a grade that]{.underline} [may be somewhat better than the one
they deserve and risking receiving a grade that is worse]{.underline},
though perhaps more in accordance with what they deserve,
[will]{.underline} **[jump]{.underline}** [at the opportunity to obtain
the higher grade]{.underline}. In this way [they are]{.underline}
[like]{.underline} many [criminal defendants who are charged with crimes
of which they know or suspect that they are guilty]{.underline}. Such
[defendants are willing, if not eager, to plead if they can]{.underline}
thereby [gain]{.underline} some measure of **[lenity]{.underline}**
[from the court]{.underline}.10 Of course, [a few defendants will
believe that they are **innocent** or **hope** that **though they are
guilty** a judge or jury will **acquit** them]{.underline}. [The former
defendants are akin to students who believe that their papers are
significantly better than the professor's cursory reading found them to
be]{.underline}---indeed [so much]{.underline} [better]{.underline} that
[the proffered]{.underline} higher [grade]{.underline} still [does
not]{.underline}, in their view, [give them what they
deserve]{.underline}. [The latter defendants---ones who know that they
are guilty but who hope that trials will produce acquittals---are like
students who know or suspect that the cursory reading was on the mark
but who hope that demanding a second reading will yield a grade outcome
that is no worse than the proffered grade]{.underline}. Perhaps they
believe, or vainly hope, that the professor will be intimidated by
students who insist on a second reading, fearful that such students will
turn out to be belligerent grade-grubbers who will demand conferences at
which the professor must explain and justify the assigned grade in
laborious detail. Such students surmise that, rather than risk having to
endure such conferences, the professor will be more generous in her
second reading than the paper warrants. There might also be some
students who are indifferent about their grades, at least to the extent
that the proffered higher grade does not succeed in motivating them to
waive their right to a second reading. Such students, for whatever
reasons, insist on the second reading and are prepared to live with the
outcome. They are like criminal defendants who know they are guilty as
charged, suspect that trials will yield convictions, but are indifferent
to the sentencing deals offered by state officials. [Such defendants are
grimly determined to make the state go through the motions of trial
conviction]{.underline}. One suspects that defendants of this kind are
exceedingly rare. (p.15) Kipnis offers the grade-bargaining analogy to
convince us that [there is something deeply suspect about plea
bargaining. Grade bargaining is inappropriate because grades should be
determined based on a professor's honest and careful assessment of the
merits of student work]{.underline}. [The grading of student papers is a
practice that is strongly governed by **desert norms**]{.underline}, in
the sense that considerations other than what students deserve because
of their work are almost always irrelevant, or hardly count at all. So
too, Kipnis suggests, there is something wrong with having criminal
offenders' sentences determined by bargaining between them and
prosecutors or judges. [State officials have a responsibility to see to
it that offenders are punished **commensurately** with the seriousness
of their crimes]{.underline}.11 We will subsequently spend considerable
time analyzing the arguments that might be given to justify waiver
rewards, including ones that defend it within a deserved-punishment
framework. But, if nothing else, Kipnis's analogy helps us to see the
way in which soliciting pleas with offers of waiver rewards appears
troubling. Kipnis's analogy can be developed further in order to refine
our understanding of waiver rewards and trial penalties. One thing that
the analogy provides is what we might term a student's "presumptive
grade." This is the grade suggested by the professor's cursory reading
of the paper. It is presumptive in the sense that a second, more careful
reading of the paper might convince the professor to change the grade.
The second reading might yield a higher grade or a lower one. Either
could be fully justified given the second reading. If a student demands
a second reading and the professor supplies it, and does so fairly and
conscientiously, then the student has no reasonable grounds for
complaint if the second reading leads the professor to revise the
presumptive grade downward. This was a risk that the student took in
requesting the second reading. Importantly, the lowered grade is not a
penalty for having requested the second reading if the second reading is
done without malice; instead it is a reasonable and foreseeable possible
outcome of the second reading. But [what if the professor]{.underline},
[irked at having to supply a second reading, consciously or even
unconsciously evaluates the paper more negatively]{.underline}? [She
might actively search through the paper for flaws or shortcomings, or
see the ones that she has already seen in a more negative light. Or she
might decide to take out her annoyance with the student more directly by
assigning her paper a lower grade than the cursory reading grade without
bothering to find some pretext for doing so]{.underline}. [It
will]{.underline}, undoubtedly, [be very hard to tell whether the
professor has done things of this kind. We might even suspect that she
is likely to do them, especially if she is prepared to shirk her
responsibilities and engage in grade bargaining of the kind described in
the first place]{.underline}. If she does penalize the student in one of
these ways for having requested a second reading, then it would seem
that the student has a legitimate complaint about the (p.16) outcome.
Her lowered paper grade is not one she risked by refusing the grade
bargain and requesting a "fair" second reading. [It is]{.underline}
instead partly [a function of the professor's desire to retaliate
against the student for having the temerity to request a more thorough
reading of her paper]{.underline}. In this, [we have an analogy
with]{.underline} what I deem [a]{.underline} **[trial
penalty]{.underline}** proper. Notice this also: [Students confronted by
professors who offer grade bargains might reasonably worry about what
will happen to them if they refuse the bargain and insist on a second,
more careful evaluation]{.underline}. [What **looks like an offer**
might plausibly be construed by students as harboring a
**threat**]{.underline}. In some cases, [a grade-bargaining professor's
tendency to be harder on students who request second readings will
become **common knowledge**]{.underline}; word will get around that
[this is something students should expect. If this occurs, and the
professor does nothing to combat the perception of vindictiveness on her
part---or worse, encourages it by coyly denying that anything of the
sort takes place when challenged by students unhappy with their
second-reading grades---then]{.underline} at some point it will become
clear that [the professor is trading on her reputation for punishing
students who are foolish enough to demand second readings]{.underline}.
Provisionally, then, we can say that [a trial penalty is an additional
increment of punishment imposed on defendants who are convicted after
trials]{.underline}, [one]{.underline} that is
**[unrelated]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline} [seriousness of their
crimes]{.underline} as these are revealed at their trials. The added
measure of punishment is [inflicted for the sole purpose of retaliating
against defendants]{.underline} [who]{.underline} have [elected trial
adjudication of the charges against them]{.underline}. Waiver rewards,
by contrast, are downward departures from the punishment defendants
merit for their crimes, at least on the assumption that a defensible
sentencing scheme is in place and that state officials attempt in a
serious and careful way to assign sentences according to relevant
sentencing factors under that scheme. These accounts will need to be
modified later on, but for now they will suffice. Detecting trial
penalties

Fundamentally, behaviors that inflate non-discount prices to maximize
the discount price can be coercive given that people often are obliged
to pay the non-discounted price, such as in the case of the trial
penalty. Plea bargains may be more efficient for prosecutors, but long
term, through the iterative process of slowly overcharging more and more
for low-level crimes, we've created the biggest prison system in history
by most metrics. Plea bargaining both allows for many, many more cases
to be processed then otherwise could, allowing the prosecution of great
swaths of low level offenders, and it causes increased pressure on the
non-discounted price as prosecutors desire new ways to turn the screws
to induce a plea bargain, causing people who do go to trial to have much
higher punishments. Historically, we see a trend of increased
criminalization of low-level crimes like Prohibition or particularly the
War on Drugs being a cause for plea bargaining needing to exist, which
also corresponds with the increased incarceration rate, particularly
after the 1970s.

#### Plea bargaining was considered legal chicanery and unconstitutional for most SCOTUS jurisprudence, but came to be accepted after a deluge of new cases after Prohibition. More cases increase pressure for prosectors to get plea bargains to lower the caseload

[Plea bargaining accounts for]{.underline} almost **[98
percent]{.underline}** [of federal convictions and]{.underline} **[95
percent]{.underline}** [of state convictions in the United
States]{.underline}. So prevalent is the American plea-bargaining system
that [the US Supreme Court wrote in 2012 that ours "is for the most part
**a system of pleas, not a system of trials**]{.underline}." Missouri v.
Frye, 566 U.S. 134, 143--44 (2012). But this has not always been the
case. [The American system]{.underline}, it turns out, [began as a
system of trials]{.underline}, much like that found in the English
common law that served as its predecessor. [Gradually]{.underline},
however, the concept of [plea bargaining took root]{.underline} in the
United States and grew in the shadows [until]{.underline}, [by the
latter half of the 20th century, it had come to
**dominate**]{.underline}. As might be expected from a system that grew
in the shadows, [plea bargaining evolved **without much oversight**,
regulation, or monitorship by the bar, the courts, or the
legislatures]{.underline}. As a result, [plea bargaining evolved in
different ways from one jurisdiction to another]{.underline}. Further,
[as plea bargaining gained ground, jurisdictions failed to establish
guiding principles or guardrails to ensure that plea practices were
appropriate and did not infringe defendants' constitutional rights,
particularly the right to trial found in the Sixth
Amendment]{.underline}. Recently, the American Bar Association adopted a
new set of guiding principles crafted to provide an avenue to a more
consistent plea-bargaining system and to establish guardrails to help
ensure that plea practices are consistent with the Constitution and a
thoughtful system of criminal justice. The principles, which cover a
host of topics such as the use of impermissibly coercive incentives, the
use of pretrial detention in plea bargaining, the provision of adequate
discovery before a defendant pleads guilty, and the collection of
plea-bargaining data by the courts, are the result of almost four years
of work by the ABA Criminal Justice Section Plea Bargaining Task Force.
This article tells the story of plea bargaining's rise to dominance,
discusses the costs of bargains, and introduces the 14 principles that
are now ABA policy and that provide a path forward to a fairer, more
transparent, and more just system of criminal adjudication. The Early
Rejection of Bargains It is not surprising that many people believe plea
bargaining has a deep common law history, particularly given how
dominant plea bargaining is in today's criminal justice system. But the
actual history of [plea bargaining]{.underline} reveals that this form
of adjudication [is a relatively modern American invention that sprang
from the need to create a more efficient criminal system in the face of
the over-criminalization of the early 20th century]{.underline}. [Prior
to the 20th century]{.underline}, in fact, [courts]{.underline}
interpreting the common law [were]{.underline} wholly
**[averse]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the concept of [bargained
justice. In]{.underline} the [1783]{.underline} English case of Rex v.
Warickshall, for example, [the court]{.underline} examined a case in
which the defendant had been offered a "promise of favor" in return for
a confession. 168 Eng. Rep 234, 235 (1783). In response, the court
[wrote]{.underline}, "\[[A\] confession forced from the mind by the
flattery of hope, or by the torture of fear, comes in so questionable a
shape ... that no credit ought to be given to it]{.underline}." Id. This
language reflected the importance placed by the common law in the jury
trial. In the United States, the significance of the jury was captured
in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Of the trial's place in the
American experiment, Thomas [Jefferson wrote]{.underline}, "[I consider
trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man, by which a
government can be held to the principles of its
constitution]{.underline}." The combination of these sentiments from the
American founders and the existing precedent from the British common law
led inevitably to the adoption of language similar to Warickshall by the
US courts. In Bram v. United States, for example, the US Supreme Court
considered the appropriateness of incentives to confess. 168 U.S. 532,
584 (1987). [The Court concluded that the "true test of admissibility is
that the confession is made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion
or inducement of any sort]{.underline}." Id. Despite the strong language
in opposition to bargains contained in case law from the 18th and 19th
centuries, examples of plea bargaining in the trenches of the American
criminal justice system can be found as early as the late 1700s in
sporadic geographic locations. For example, according to Professor
George Fisher, forms of plea bargaining occurred in liquor law
violations in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, during the late 1700s.
Professor Dan Canon's research also identifies early examples of plea
bargaining in Massachusetts and, eventually, New England in the
mid-1800s. Despite the use of early forms of plea bargaining in the
trenches during this period, the courts continued to adhere to the
British and American precedents and their critical view of offering
incentives to plead guilty. In the late 1800s, for example, the
California Supreme Court wrote, "[When there is reason to believe that
the plea has been entered through inadvertence]{.underline} ... and
mainly [from the hope that the punishment]{.underline} to which the
accused would otherwise be exposed [may]{.underline} thereby [be
mitigated, the Court should be indulgent in permitting the plea to be
withdrawn]{.underline}." People v. McCrory, 41 Cal. 458, 462 (1871).
Around the same time, [the Wisconsin Supreme Court wrote that plea
bargaining is "hardly, if at all distinguishable in principle from a
direct sale of justice]{.underline}." Wright v. Rindskopf, 43 Wis. 344,
353 (1877). [Yet]{.underline}, despite these precedents, [plea
bargaining]{.underline} continued to gain a foothold in the American
criminal justice system as it [began its rise to dominance.]{.underline}
A defining moment in the rise of plea bargaining was the
over-criminalization of the early 20th century, particularly
[once]{.underline} the **[Prohibition]{.underline}** era
[arrived]{.underline}. During this period of American history, [the
number of prosecutions swelled, and courts quickly became
overwhelmed]{.underline}. As public officials searched for an answer to
this growing crisis of resources, [plea bargaining]{.underline}, and the
efficiency it might offer, became a potential solution. In 1931, as the
criminal justice system continued to strain under the weight of large
dockets, President Herbert Hoover convened the Wickersham Commission to
examine crime in America. The Commission's findings included a specific
discussion of the plea bargaining already occurring in the trenches and
the potential that utilization of this system of adjudication might
provide an answer for the whole system. [\[F\]ederal prosecutions under
the Prohibition Act terminated in 1930 had become nearly **eight times**
as many as the total of all pending federal prosecutions in
1914]{.underline}. In a number of urban districts the enforcement
agencies maintain that [the only practicable way of meeting]{.underline}
[this situation]{.underline} with the existing machinery of federal
courts . . . [is]{.underline} for the United States [Attorneys to make
bargains with defendants or their counsel whereby defendants plead
guilty to minor offenses and escape with light penalties]{.underline} .
. . Lawyers everywhere deplore, as one of the most serious effects of
prohibition, the change in the general attitude toward the federal
courts. . . . \[T\]he huge volume of liquor prosecutions . . . has
injured their dignity, impaired their efficiency, and endangered the
wholesome respect for them which once obtained. Nat'l Comm'n on Law
Observance & Enf't, Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of
the United States 56 (1931). Although little data are available
regarding the widespread growth of plea bargaining in the early 20th
century, data on pleas of guilty are available. These data illustrate
that between the early 20th century and 1925, the guilty plea rate in
federal court rose from 50 percent to 90 percent. Lucian E. Dervan,
Bargained Justice: Plea Bargaining's Innocence Problem and the Brady
Safety-Valve, 2012 Utah L. Rev. 51, 59 (2012). Much of this increase is
likely attributable to the growth of plea bargaining in the shadows, as
observed by the Wickersham Commission. Despite what appears to be a
growing utilization of plea bargaining in the early 20th century, the US
courts continued to view such behavior with suspicion. In fact, so
inconsistent was the practice of plea bargaining with prior common law
precedent that on several occasions the US Supreme Court appeared on the
precipice of ruling it a wholly unconstitutional practice. In 1958, for
example, the Court took up the case of Shelton v. United States. 356
U.S. 26 (1958), cert. granted. The Shelton case had originated in the
Fifth Circuit, where the defendant had requested his plea be set aside
as involuntary and coerced. In response, the Fifth Circuit, in granting
the motion, wrote: There is no doubt, indeed it is practically conceded,
that the appellant pleaded guilty in reliance on the promise of the
Assistant United States Attorney that he would receive a sentence of
only one year. The court, before accepting the plea, did not ascertain
that it was in truth and in fact a voluntary plea not induced by such
promise. It necessarily follows that the judgment of conviction must be
set aside and the plea of guilty vacated. Shelton v. United States, 242
F.2d 101, 113 (5th Cir. 1957). The Fifth Circuit also wrote, "Justice
and liberty are not the subjects of bargaining and barter," a statement
strikingly similar to the words written by the Wisconsin Supreme Court
in Wright in 1877. Id. The case then went to the U.S. Supreme Court but
was removed by the government prior to a ruling. Some believe this was a
result of the Department of Justice counting heads and determining that
the Court was likely to agree with the lower court and strike down plea
bargaining once and for all. See Albert W. Alschuler, Plea Bargaining
and Its History, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 37 (1979). Eight years later in
1966, another case made its way to the US Supreme Court and, once again,
the Court's reluctance to embrace bargaining was on full display. The
case, United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968), involved a statute
that contained an increased punishment for those convicted by a jury.
Although not a plea bargain, the case put before the justices the issue
of punishing those who proceeded to trial. In ruling the provision
unconstitutional because it placed an "impermissible burden on the
exercise of a constitutional right," the Court wrote, "It is no answer .
. . that federal trial judges may be relied upon to reject coerced pleas
of guilty and involuntary waivers of jury trials. For the evil in the
federal statute is not that it necessarily coerces guilty pleas and jury
waivers but simply that it needlessly encourages them." Id. at 583. The
strength of this language, in combination with the various earlier
precedents, would lead many to believe that plea bargaining's days were
numbered in 1968, but they would be wrong. Brady and Modern Plea
Bargaining Just two years after Jackson, [the case of Brady v. United
States]{.underline}, 397 U.S. 742 ([1970]{.underline}), made its way to
the US Supreme Court. This case finally brought the issue of plea
bargaining squarely before the justices. The defendant in Brady argued
that his plea should be withdrawn because he was coerced into pleading
guilty to avoid the possibility of receiving the death penalty. Rather
than continue to enforce earlier precedents that prohibited pleas of
guilty that resulted from the "flattery of hope" or the "torture of
fear," [the Court embraced plea bargaining]{.underline} as a mechanism
of efficiency that might free up resources for cases that did proceed to
trial. This decision is striking for its inconsistency with the earlier
precedents dating back to English common law, but there are several key
elements that led to this result in 1970. First, the passage of time had
created an opportunity for plea bargaining to survive review. For
example, since the Shelton case had been removed from consideration in
1958, five new justices had taken the oath and would decide plea
bargaining's fate. Further, by 1970, 90 percent of cases in the United
States were resolved through pleas of guilty. While the exact number
that involved plea bargaining is unclear, the Justices must have
understood the devastation that would be wrought on the criminal justice
system had they ruled the practice entirely unconstitutional. Second,
the Court believed that there was a need for a more efficient method of
adjudication given that the court systems continued to be overburdened,
just as the courts had been when plea bargaining grew in the trenches in
the 1920s. Even the American Bar Association was adopting this line of
reasoning during this period. In 1968, for example, the American Bar
Association Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty 2 (1968) said: \[A\]
high proportion of pleas of guilty and nolo contendere does benefit the
system. Such pleas tend to limit the trial process to deciding real
disputes and, consequently, to reduce the need for funds and personnel.
If the number of judges, courtrooms, court personnel and counsel for
prosecution and defense were to be increased substantially, the funds
necessary for such increases might be diverted from elsewhere in the
criminal justice process. Moreover, the limited use of the trial process
for those cases in which the defendant has grounds for contesting the
matter of guilty aids in preserving the meaningfulness of the
presumption of innocence. Id. In fact, the need to address the
overburdened court systems was particularly pressing in 1970 as a result
of the Due Process Revolution of the 1960s and the increasing lengths of
trials that resulted. While the Brady decision brought plea bargaining
out of the shadows, [the ruling did not lead to robust oversight,
regulation, or monitorship of this mechanism of adjudication that had
come to dominate]{.underline}. [Few]{.underline}, if any, [significant
restrictions were placed on the use or methods of plea
bargain]{.underline}ing going forward, and different jurisdictions
adopted the practice in inconsistent ways. While plea bargaining in the
decades following Brady offered some of the benefits envisioned by the
Court in 1970, such as efficiency, the [piecemeal]{.underline}
[adoption]{.underline} of plea bargaining has also [resulted in costs
and the development of troubling practices.]{.underline} For example,
while the Court envisioned plea bargaining as a means to direct more
resources towards the remaining trials, [plea bargaining
has]{.underline} actually [contributed to the disappearance of the trial
itself]{.underline}. [By 2022, only **2.5 percent** of convictions at
the federal level were the result of trials.]{.underline} In [some
jurisdictions, **years** have gone by **without a single** criminal
trial taking place]{.underline}. Another troubling aspect of plea
bargaining is the presence of significant sentencing differentials,
which are the differences between the sentence someone receives for
pleading guilty versus the sentence they receive in return for utilizing
their constitutional right to trial. In a 2019 piece on federal
sentencing, the author found that those convicted at trial had a two to
six times greater likelihood of incarceration and the sentencing lengths
were 20 to 60 percent longer. See Brian Johnson, Plea-Trial Differences
in Federal Punishment, 31 Fed. Sent'g Rep. 256 (2019). Similarly, a Vera
Institute Report from 2020 entitled In the Shadows noted that the odds
of incarceration were 2.7 times greater for those who went to trial and
the sentences were 57 percent longer. See Ram Subramanain et al, Vera
Inst. of Just., In the Shadows: A Review of the Research on Plea
Bargaining (Sept. 2020).

#### The harms of plea bargaining include higher probabilities of incarceration, more severe punishments, innocents falsely pleading guilty, coercion, coverups of police misconduct, and worse outcomes for black and brown folk

For example, while the Court envisioned plea bargaining as a means to
direct more resources towards the remaining trials, plea bargaining has
actually contributed to the disappearance of the trial itself. By 2022,
only 2.5 percent of convictions at the federal level were the result of
trials. In some jurisdictions, years have gone by without a single
criminal trial taking place. Another troubling aspect of plea bargaining
is the presence of significant sentencing differentials, which are the
differences between the sentence someone receives for pleading guilty
versus the sentence they receive in return for utilizing their
constitutional right to trial. In a 2019 piece on federal sentencing,
the author found that [those convicted at trial had a **two to six**

for those who went to trial and the sentences were **57 percent**
longer]{.underline}. See Ram Subramanain et al, Vera Inst. of Just., In
the Shadows: A Review of the Research on Plea Bargaining (Sept. 2020).
The types of [sentencing differentials]{.underline} described above also
impact defendant decision-making and have [led to the phenomenon of
false pleas of guilty by the innocent]{.underline}. By the end of 2022,
[the National Registry of Exonerations had **3,284 exonerations** within
its dataset, and **25 percent** of those involved a false plea of
guilty]{.underline}. Of the entire dataset, [more than 40 percent are
"no-crime exonerations]{.underline}," which are exonerations [where the
exoneree was convicted of a crime that never actually
occurred]{.underline}. In this category, [a startling **48 percent** of
the cases involved **false pleas** of guilty by the
innocent]{.underline}. See Nat'l Registry of Exonerations, 2022 Annual
Report, at 11 (May 8, 2023). Modern plea practice has also seen the use
of impermissibly coercive incentives to induce defendants to plead
guilty beyond the sentence in the case. For example,
[prosecutors]{.underline} have [used **threats** to indict children,
spouses, or other family members to induce pleas of guilty, including in
cases where the pleas served to **cover up** pervasive law enforcement
**misconduct** that would have been revealed at trial]{.underline}.
United States v. Seng Cheng Yong, 926 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2019). In other
examples, modern plea practices have included the use of the power of
plea bargaining to force defendants to accept inappropriate conditions
as part of the deal. In Tennessee, for example, [a prosecutor only
offered favorable pleas to women in certain abuse and neglect cases if
they agreed to forced **sterilization**]{.underline}. See ABA CJS, 2023
Plea Bargain Task Force Report (Feb. 22, 2023). Finally, another example
of the impact of an unregulated and unguided system of pleas is that
[plea bargaining **exacerbates** existing **racial
inequality**]{.underline} in the criminal justice system. For example,
[Black defendants in drug cases are less likely to receive favorable
plea offers that avoid mandatory minimum sentences]{.underline}. The
same was found [in gun cases]{.underline}, where [Black defendants are
more often subjected to charge stacking than white
defendants]{.underline}. Further, [white defendants who face initial
felony charges are less likely than Black defendants to be convicted of
a felony, and white defendants facing misdemeanor charges are more
likely than Black defendants to have the cases dismissed or resolved
without incarceration]{.underline}. See id. Though this is a
nonexhaustive list of some of the costs of bargains and troubling
practices that have developed, these examples serve to demonstrate the
need for better guidance regarding how our system of pleas should
operate and what our expectations should be for our system of criminal
justice. The Fourteen Principles

#### Plea bargains exclude pleading guilty without prior negotiation with the prosecutors. This means post-aff, if people dislike trials still, they can informally plea bargain hoping to get in the prosecutors' good graces

**Canon 22** \[Dan Canon, civil rights lawyer and a law professor at the
University of Louisville in Kentucky., 2022, "Pleading Out : How Plea
Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class," Basic Books,
ISBN-139781541674684\]/Kankee

This book will argue that despite its nearly universal acceptance in the
United States, the practice of plea bargaining is not natural,
necessary, or beneficial. In fact, no other country on Earth relies on
plea bargaining to the extent that the United States does, and it's no
coincidence that so many legal systems function much better than ours.
Some US jurisdictions have also experimented with ending plea
bargaining, with surprising results. This book will look at those
examples to expose plea bargaining for what it really is: a means to
perpetuate centuries-old class conflict, a tool for satisfying the
appetite of the prison-industrial complex, and a chief enabler of the
ills that plague our criminal justice system today. JUST WHAT IS A PLEA
BARGAIN ANYWAY? FOR OUR PURPOSES, [A plea bargain means that someone
charged with a crime **makes a deal** with a prosecutor in which they
give up the right to go to trial]{.underline} (and a whole host of other
rights). In exchange, the person charged gets a reduced sentence of some
kind ("sentence bargaining"), a change in the charge ("charge
bargaining"), or both. [A plea bargain is **not** the same thing as a
simple guilty plea, or what is sometimes called an "open
plea]{.underline}," [where the defendant is offered, and **expects,
nothing** in return for an admission of guilt]{.underline}. The practice
of [plea bargaining]{.underline} has changed somewhat over time, but it
has basically **[always]{.underline}** [been a prosecutor telling the
defendant "Make this quick, and I'll give you a break]{.underline}." Or
rather "[Make this difficult for me, and I'll make it really difficult
for you]{.underline}." That's what happened to Paul Hayes, and it's what
happens to countless people in US courtrooms every day. The specifics of
how plea bargaining got its start are unclear. There is no "first" plea
bargain to examine, nor is there any substantial empirical data on the
practice for around a hundred years after it began. I owe much of the
foundational material in the first two chapters of this book to
sociologist and legal scholar Mary Vogel, who has written extensively on
the history of the practice in the United States and on its English
roots. According to Vogel, the first recognizable records of plea
bargaining in America are from Boston in the 1830s.4 At that time,
"records" of criminal cases didn't amount to much, so there isn't a lot
of detail about how or why the practice became acceptable, but we know
that it was officially forbidden, or at least strongly discouraged, by
courts around the country before that time. Soon after plea bargaining
caught on in Boston, courts nationwide began an about-face on this
issue. Within a century, judges developed a nearly universal line of
reasoning that likened plea agreements to plain old contracts like the
kind you would sign to get a credit card or to buy health insurance. But
these "contracts" are what lawyers might call "contracts of adhesion."
Defendants don't really have much choice about whether to enter such a
"contract." A fast-food worker with a marijuana charge doesn't have the
same bargaining power as the ubiquitous state and all its resources. In
bargaining, the state risks nothing whereas a defendant risks every
liberty under the sun. Nevertheless, the law persists in pretending that
the two are on equal footing as negotiators

#### 1.1.3 Note on Contention Cross Applicability

Given the interwovenness of the criminal justice system, most
contentions somewhat blend into each other, with elements of coercion,
mass incarceration, innocent pleas, and racial impacts being found in
other contentions not directly related to the issue. If you're looking
for cards for a specific issue, remember to look at other contentions
given they too might have utilizable evidence for your contention.

#### 1.1.4 Note on Kritik Commonality 

Criminal justice topics have kritiks as an extremely commonplace neg
(and often aff) position. This is particularly due to how aff probably
perpetuates the prison industrial complex, an option unpalatable to
some, which encourages them to run kritikal affirmatives (k-affs).
Similarly, neg solvency is often related to ending the prison industrial
complex, such as crashing/sabotaging the justice system by ending plea
bargains.

Kritik literature is very good on this topic given that critical theory
related to antiblackness and biopower has focused particularly on the
development of the modern prison and carceral state, creating a
renaissance for authors like Foucault, Sexton, Wilderson, etc. Perhaps
more so than any other point in history, antiblackness, racial
capitalism, abolition, and Foucault scholarship is the most relevant,
recent, and developed, all of whom mutually reinforcing each other.
These concepts are also interconnected; for instance, antiblackness
scholarship often relies on Foucauldian ideas in relation to identity
construction of criminality, which is applied to black folks via the
prison industrial complex to continue the current perception of social
death.

Kritiks on this topic are more likely now then perhaps ever in your
debate career to be a go-to position. My advice is that you ought to
become familiar with at least 1-2 of these kritiks' literature bases and
understand the arguments; I recommend Foucault/abolition and/or racial
capitalism for starters. You also ought to prepare for an off-case
position besides topicality for kritikal affs---there is obvious choice
of capitalism (which has great links on this topic in relation to the
prison industrial complex as well as commodity fetishism). Remember that
these authors and literature bases speak to and criticize each other,
allowing answers to arguments like abolition with antiblackness or
Afro-pessimism with Foucault.

#### 1.1.5 Note on Counter Plans and Required Neg Advocacy

The plea bargaining topic's aff/neg ground distinction is quirky, which
necessitates an explanation on its implications on counterplans.

Normally, the aff proposes that the status quo is unjust or immoral,
implicitly or explicitly implying policy changes to rectify those
justice/morality harms, which is easily found in common-place
resolutions stating "X actor ought to Y" or "Y practice in the status
quo is unjust." For example, resolutions like wealth tax (Nov-Dec 2024)
or living wage (Sept-Oct 2024) are premised on the fact that in current
practice, a wealth tax or living wage requirement do NOT exist, implying
that aff ought to adjust the status quo in order to make present-day
conditions more moral. The space appropriation topic (Jan-Feb 2022) had
the aff argue that a current practice (commercial space appropriation)
is unjust, again implying the status quo is undesirable and change is
needed. As a general rule, aff is almost always the side that advocates
for a resolution-based change from the status quo.

Similarly, ordinarily neg is obliged to defend the status quo or a
different (usually non-resolutional) change from the status quo,
justifying their counterplan with a net benefit that the aff causes, but
the counterplan does not. The aff proposes a change per the resolution,
and the neg either rejects that change or finds a different, more
desirable means of solving the harms of the status quo via a
counterplan.

The aff/neg advocacy reversal has four major implications:

**[First]{.underline}**, neg's obligation is to argue that plea
bargaining is either unjust or merely morally permissible. Assuming the
former, neg has an implied unconditional advocacy of plea bargaining
being unjust and it is in need of major reform and/or abolition to
maximize justice. Unlike normal, usually conditional counterplans, in
which neg can kick the counterplan and no longer defend the advocacy
without consequence, plea bargaining being unjust is an unconditional
advocacy, even if only implied. It's the premise of most aff harms
related to plea bargain abolition, so skirting out of the link to aff
advantages via a non-reformative neg advocacy has some theory-related
issues.

**[Second]{.underline}**, the unconditional implied "don't do plea
bargaining" advocacy is not the only advocacy available to the neg
(though its defense is necessary to negate). Other counterplan(s) can
exist concurrently with the implied advocacy of not doing plea
bargaining, and importantly, these counterplans can resolve the problems
with the other advocacy in order to minimize aff ground reform. As seen
in the below "advantage counterplan" contention, core aff justifications
for plea bargaining is beneficial primarily because of efficiency/low
resource, wait times, and the trial tax. These are somewhat easily
resolved via a counterplan that increases funding, hires additional
justices/attorneys, ends pretrial detention, and decreases/eliminates
the benefits of plea bargaining by changing sentencing laws and
prosecutorial overcharging.

Counterplans' relative ease in solving aff problems related to how plea
bargaining is a contrived, socially constructed problem beyond perhaps a
potential shortage in legal staff --- some authors have described not
critiquing plea bargaining as "The Emperors New Clothes" for that very
reason. Most aff justifications for plea bargaining suffer from limited
imagination (and limited fiat), such as plea bargaining being bad
because trials have worse punishments or causes court clog, ignoring the
fact those are easily solvable, yet self-created problems fixed by
decreasing punishment severity for trials and decreasing the amount of
low-level crime we prosecute. It's often framed as we have plea
bargaining because we have a lot of cases, and we have a lot of cases
because we have plea bargaining, which is fundamentally a circular
justification.

**[Third]{.underline}**, for aff, the vulnernability to counterplans
necessitates the finding the rare evidence arguing for the intrinsic
goodness of avoiding the trial process. Your harms need to be specific
to the trial process itself, not merely the effects of the trial process
like court clog or worse sentences (as both those impacts are easily
solved by advantage counterplans). Some contentions in this brief with
"trials bad" warrants include the aff "trials bad (pathologized
subject)" contention and to a lesser degree, the "trials bad (waiting
times)" contention. For example, a rape or domestic violence victim
appearing on the stand and being cross-examined, with the defense
attorney's intent being to undermine her credibility and potentially
victim blame, is a traumatic process and an obstacle to the prosecution
of these crimes. As described in the "trials bad (pathologized subject)"
contention, the trial process often retraumatizes the victim all the
while jury trials can be an obstacle to justice due to their propensity
to not believe victims of sexual violence. Plea bargaining avoids the
traumatic process of testifying and increases the likelihood of
prosecution with lower standards of evidence at prosecution, both of
whom reducing the risks of these crimes occurring.

**[Fourth]{.underline}**, neg needs to avoid running a counterplan when
neg garners offense via the effects of abolishing plea bargaining when
the counterplan would also solve that impact. For instance, do not run a
"plea bargaining solves mass incarceration" argument AND an advantage
counterplan that results in mass incarceration ending due to lower
sentencing. Pick and choose what planks of a counterplan you need to run
to both solve the identified impacts from the 1AC AND minimize the
potential for the counterplan solving your own contentions.

If the resolution's advocacy reversal and its relationship to neg
advocacy and counterplan ground is bewildering and difficult to grasp,
congratulations; you now know why the overwhelming majority of
resolutions do NOT have the aff defend the status quo. Ordinarily, an
aff advocacy is limited in its fiat capabilities to the confines of the
resolution, with neg possessing great flexibility in terms of
counterplan ground to attack the aff from multiple angles. This includes
advantage counterplans, which seek to solve aff impacts. With the
advocacy reversal, neg flexibility has a high potential for abuse given
that the neg can both propose a policy (end plea bargaining), and then
fiat away the harms of that policy via an additional counterplan (i.e.
the "advantage counterplan" contention).

I have little expertise in the subject, and this explanation will be
minimal given that the history of debate's theoretical justifications
for counterplans is over 100+ years old. Look at Bill Batterman's series
on debate counterplan history linked
[here](https://the3nr.com/2021/07/04/the-evolution-of-plans-in-policy-debate-part-6-policy-testing-planicality-and-hypothesis-planning/)
if you desire more context beyond "advocacy reversal means counterplans
might not be justified." Most neg positions, such as counterplans or
even disadvantages, were not created in a vacuum at the initial creation
of policy debate, which is the theoretical foundation of circuit
debate's counterplans. Rather, policy resolutions had a history of the
aff being the side that advocated for change, which led to theories of
flexibility for the negative in order to better answer potentially
unpredictable affs and attack the aff from multiple angles with
counterplans. The plea bargaining topic breaks from tradition from most
LD and policy topics with its advocacy reversal, which is a proximate
cause for why this topic's counterplans have high potency for abuse that
harms aff ground.

Debate history and theory aside, the main lessons to take away are the
following:

For the aff, remember these three things (a) have intrinsic trial bad
evidence for aff to have intrinsic advantages not vulnerable to
counterplans, (2) don't assume counterplans are theoretically justified
merely because they've existed for a long time or common practice, (3)
be very wary of advantage counterplans and design your aff to beat them
(alongside the normal preemptive link turns to neg disadvantages that
you *always* should have in 1AC).

For the neg, you possess four advantages: (a) the typical aff ground
with moral and emotional appeals related to poor, minority, and
disadvantaged folks suffering from horrible things, forcing many aff
debaters to focus on cold, efficient, and brutal utilitarianism, (b)
advocacy proposal and not needing to defend an undesirable status quo
(c) neg fiat for counterplans that can solve most of the harms the
change from the status quo causes, and (d) the time split favorability
for neg that normally exists to compensate for an unpredictable aff
advocacies, which is not the case here because you are advocating a
change from the status quo.

### 1.2 Affirmative Topic Analysis

#### 1.2.1 Trials Bad (Pathologized Subject)

The idea was 'not to punish less, but to punish better; to punish with
an attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more
universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply
into the social body' - Foucault

Contention 1 is Trials Bad (Pathologized Subject). Foucault's theories
described in *Discipline and Punish* (as well as the later developments
on Foucauldian theory) are paramount to know about on criminal justice
reform topics, particularly if you feel the slightest risk of hitting a
kritik on your debate circuit. Foucault is the go-to author for criminal
justice topics -- he was one of the first prison abolitionist authors
and his theories are the foundation for follow-up critical scholarship
about societal power and the construction of criminality (a useful
concept in antiblackness studies). If you're interested in Foucauldian
literature or heavily prioritize this contention as main aff offense, I
would recommend having a higher-order understanding of how Foucault fits
into more modern scholarship on theories of power, which I will provide
below. However, on a fundamental level, it's not paramount for you to
know the broader context, as Foucault-specific scholarship, particularly
on prisons, is remarkably good.

#### Basic Foucault Explanation

On a basic level, Foucault wrote on the historical transition in how
societies justified the state punishing crimes, and more strikingly, how
the methods of punishment were useful for state power. This transition
involved the slow, partial swap from sovereign power to disciplinary
power. Sovereign power was a concept originally derived from Hobbes that
described most of human history. Punishment was a public spectacle, with
both the act of violence as well as its long-term damage to the body
having important messaging effects to show how powerful the state was.
Highly graphic quasi-historical movies that I ought not to have seen as
a child, such as *The Son of God,* are a worthwhile showcase of
sovereign power in action with the example of Roman crucifixion. The
cruelty is the point; you'll likely remember (especially if you were an
impressionable child when watching it) both the action causing suffering
(whipping/flogging, cross-carrying, hammering in nails, etc.) as well as
the bodily reminders of the suffering (whip marks, crucified body,
nail-holes, etc.). The event itself is to be burned into your memory,
while the publicly displayed "body of the condemned," with its scars,
maims, bruises, etc., is the active, daily reminder of how the state
controls life and death. Under sovereign power, there's a dual interest
for the state in having highly memorable, spectacularized, and novel
means of hurting people as well as elongating the act itself and the
recovery and/or dying process. The purpose is for to understand your
fealty and inability to prevent the horrific atrocity of someone you may
have cared for (or at least knew tangentially) and for that memory being
forever embedded in your head in order for you to understand the
potential consequences.

Sovereign power allowed the maintenance of monarchies for most of
history, yet several developments occurred in the 18^th^ to mid-20^th^
centuries that changed how states justify their existence. Obviously,
these centuries are some of the most-action packed in history, so this
inherently will be generalities, both in terms of history and
Foucauldian theory. Human capital became increasingly important as
capitalism became more fully fledged out with industrial revolutions --
it became compelling for states to develop institutions like schools in
order to increase skilled labor and an educated workforce. Similarly,
the scientific revolution offered new prospects in the human sciences
(i.e. psychoanalysis, medicine, psychiatry). As you may already know
from framework debates, social contract theory became increasingly
popular from the likes of Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke, which questioned
the traditional rationale for governments. People were increasing
interested in self-governance reasoned via natural law, and they were
unhappy with theological or traditional justifications for the state.
The Enlightenment's individualism and desire to respect human dignity
and personhood (highly motivated by Kant and German Idealism) desired
everyone to be treated humanely. These are all factors that motivated
the transition or necessitated it, as sovereign power was no longer
sustainable, and new methods of state power gained popularity due to new
technology and philosophy.

Foucault writes broadly on biopower, which is concerned with the state's
control of bodies motivated via the "will to knowledge." The state has a
desire to know everything about its population as well as you in
particular, as if they can individualize you as a person via knowing the
traits that define you, these traits can be used to objectify you and
predict your behavior via the generalities of knowing how other people
with those traits in the population also behave. An increase in
legalistic biopower was accomplished via the humane prison movement --
prisons were seen as unjustifiable, treating people inhumanely and as a
mere means. Similarly, the state wishes to reform their previously
incarcerated citizens, especially given their high association with the
mentally ill due to the "Great Confinement." These conditions allowed
the reformulation of state power from sovereign power to disciplinary
power, where liberal, human rights-centric advocates for prison reform
advocated utilizing the new human sciences to better understand inmates
in order to rehabilitate them and reform their natures. This came to be
known as disciplinary power, where the legitimation of state punishment
was undergirded by the ideals of it being a source for good by seeking
to alter deviant behavior via rehabilitation, thereby allowing the state
to change the "souls" of people deemed perverse.

#### This card explains the older Foucauldian ideas on the value of trials for disciplinary power (as a coerced confession doesn't tell you anything about the person).

bargains reaffirm Foucauldian identity constructions (like trials do)

The fifth century monk Jean Cassian's description of monastic
confessions signaled a move away from the exteriority of exomologesis to
the interiority of exagoreusis.12 Monks verbally confessed to an elder
both the acts they committed and their accompanying thoughts, motives,
and desires. Cassian highlights the internal focus of exagoreusis,
writing "The chief concern and instruction of \[the elder\], whereby the
young man who was brought to him may be able to ascend even to the
loftiest heights of perfection, will be, first of all, to teach him to
conquer his desires."13 This practice, which Foucault calls
"veridiction" or "truth-telling," was foundational to monastic life. The
interchange between elder and monk was, therefore, "an ever present and
permanent relationship" focused on "discovering what was hidden deep
within oneself."14 Although methods and forms of confession changed
significantly from Tertullian to Cassian, the practice maintained an
overarching concern with self-renunciation: the Christian discovered the
truth of oneself by destroying the self one had become through sin.15
This began to change in 1215 with the Fourth Lateran Council. Canon 21
required that "all the faithful ... individually confess their sins in a
faithful manner to their own priest at least once a year."16 [The
emphasis upon the "faithful manner" of con- fession hints at the
emergence of a particular kind of human being as a "confessing
animal.]{.underline}"17 "[Faithful confession]{.underline}" entailed
increased -- and, in the case of clergy and some scrupulous laity,
constant -- self-examination of one's thoughts, desires, and actions. 18
More importantly, it [sedimented a concept of a self with a "conscience
\[that was\] subject both to self-examination and to external
policing]{.underline}."19 Literary and legal scholar Peter Brooks has
observed that [the introspection of confession contributed to a
"proto-modern" awareness of the self]{.underline}.20 [The]{.underline}
fully [modern subject]{.underline}, which according to Brooks comes into
view in Rousseau's Confessions, [establishes confession as the act of a
self-possessed individual who alone can bear witness to what she is in
truth]{.underline}.21 In this sense, we may understand the developments
of Lateran IV to be a watershed moment in the emergence of the modern
subject: increasingly after 1215, to be a human being is to hold within
oneself the unimpeachable truth about who one is. Moreover, the canons
of Lateran IV joined the religious command to confess one's sins with
the legal proscription of priestly involvement in ordeals.22 These two
practices -- confes- sions and ordeals -- share a common function in the
legal sphere as forms of proof. By for- bidding priests from
participating in ordeals, the Roman Catholic Church created a lacuna in
the legal process of determining the truth of a particular case.23
Beginning in the thirteenth century, avowals of wrong-doing came to
replace the ordeal as a mechanism for extracting proof. This began a
proliferation of confession in the modern European state. By the eight-
eenth century, the modern European state had endowed judges with the
power to determine the truth of a case, leaving confessions of guilt by
the supposed author of the crime as irre- futable and thus highly
coveted evidence.24 [The insatiable need for avowal in modern European
courts points the way toward Foucault's]{.underline} second
[hermeneutics of the self]{.underline}, which was
[concerned]{.underline} not [with]{.underline} renunciation but with
[the essence of the newly-formed modern subject]{.underline}. In search
of something that could give meaning to crimes committed seemingly
without reason, [European law made use of]{.underline} the nineteenth
and twentieth century interventions of [psychiatry, psycho- analysis,
and criminal anthropology]{.underline} in order [to focus upon the
subject of the act]{.underline}. It is here we see the emergence of a
criminal subjectivity.25 As these new fields crept into the courtroom,
[their concern to name and treat the subject suffering from mental
illness resulted in a legal need to punish that same
subject]{.underline}. [These burgeoning fields shaped an image of an
"enemy of society" who posed an ever-present threat to social orders,
leading to the emergence of "social defense" as a driving factor in
legal punishment]{.underline}. 26 [It was this modern claim to know the
subject without recourse to the subject's attes- tation that formed the
new hermeneutics of the self]{.underline}.27 Through psychiatric
examination and eventually, Freudian psychoanalysis, [crimes without
explanation could be integrated with and made intelligible in relation
to a criminal subject who was always and already a risk to
society]{.underline}. 28 In contrast to the prior hermeneutics in which
self-renunciation had been a crucial element for arriving at the truth
of the self, this [new]{.underline} [hermeneutics]{.underline} [sought
knowledge of one's essential criminality through external
examination.]{.underline} One might think that the move away from
self-incrimination signals the end of con- fession in criminal law.
However, European law still required avowals of wrongdoing, creating a
unique mix of the first and second hermeneutics of the self. The
twentieth century European courts concerned themselves with those who
posed a risk of social harm. Avowal in these settings was concerned
neither with what one had done nor with the renunciation of the self one
had become. It was concerned, rather, with who one was. In Foucault's
account, [the criminal subject made visible in the avowal provides the
necessary explanation for the crime committed: the accused has committed
the crime because he is, in his essence, a criminal]{.underline}. This
constitutes a doubling of avowal: [one's admission of a crime is
simultaneously a confession to a particular crime and a confes- sion of
the kind of person one is]{.underline}, namely [a criminal who must be
punished]{.underline} and against whom society must be defended.29
Foucault's conclusion to his lectures illuminates this doubling of
avowal. Foucault tells of the French lawyer and future Minister of
Justice, Robert Badinter's advocacy against the use of the death penalty
in the sentence of Patrick Henry, a man accused of kidnap- ping and
killing a child. Foucault finds the way Badinter makes his case
striking: \[[Badinter\] turned toward the jurors and said]{.underline}
to them: "But [in the end, the accused]{.underline}, of course, he
[acknowledged his crime]{.underline}. **[He confessed]{.underline}**.
[But what did he tell you about this crime]{.underline}? What
information did he give you about his crime, about the reasons for his
crime, about who he is? [You have no idea ... He did not say
anything]{.underline}. He did not want to say anything. He could not say
anything. In any case, you, [you know nothing about him]{.underline}"
... he closed with this sen- tence: "In the end, can you condemn to
death someone whom you do not know?"30 In this case, the first avowal,
which established the guilt of the defendant for a particular crime, is
not in question. It is the second avowal, the essentialization of the
criminal subject, that is at stake. By asking the jurors whether they
actually know who Henry is, Badinter questions whether a single
confession can perform both tasks. [It]{.underline} further [shows the
legal necessity for a confession to speak to one's
identity]{.underline}, since as Badinter implies, only saying what one
has done leaves the legal process unfulfilled. This anecdote provides
insight into Michael Phillips's case as well. While Henry failed to
provide a satisfactory double confession, Phillips's false confession
met both requirements: he both admitted his guilt and confirmed his
criminal identity. His lawyer's advice to take the plea deal because a
jury is unlikely to "believe a Black man over a white girl" suggests
that court actors, possibly even the lawyer himself, had already
determined who Phillips was. His confession confirmed their suspicions
and, as I will show in later sections, made him into the very criminal
they thought him to be. The narrative I have told here is necessarily
incomplete. For one thing, it focuses entirely on developments in Europe
and not in England, where much of American crim- inal law derives.
However, what this Foucauldian genealogy illustrates is the extent to
which Christian confessional practices are implicated in the development
of a confessing legal subject whose self-implication speaks not only of
one's actions at a given time and place but also, and more importantly,
of one's essence. This brief Foucauldian genealogy points out the
fundamental need of criminal justice systems to identify a criminal
subject as the object of punishment. What remains to be seen, however,
is the way that the con- temporary American criminal justice system
constructs racialized criminal subjects who are, as Sylvia Wynter puts
it, "not-quite-human," and for this reason, in need of punishment.

For the purposes of the contention, the potency of disciplinary power is
related to how the state produces knowledge about you via the
"hermeneutics of the self," which allows the pathologization of behavior
and the social construction of criminality based on your background
(such as your mum not loving you enough or having a mental illness). The
human sciences entered trials as a means of expert-testimony to testify
on the psycho-biological nature of both the defendant and victim,
producing knowledge about them in an "examination" that increases the
state's control over them. This allows the construction of normalcy as
the state can now defined what abnormal and deviant bodies are, given
their worthiness of rehabilitation and classification of criminality,
and the good, normal bodies. Plea bargains are fact-minimal and don't
care about pathologizing behavior or how truly deserving the defendant
is of punishment. Given that the current system is \~90% plea bargains
and how the prison system is not dedicated to rehabilitation, we do NOT
exercise the original Foucauldian conception of disciplinary power at
least in a trial context. We still discipline within prisons, but it is
much more retributive and not deemed desirable to regurgitate/remake bad
souls into good souls.

#### Modern Successors to Foucault

For all the novices or lay debaters who hates the fact that they've read
this contention explanation thus far, it gets worse. Foucault died in
the 1980s; afterwards theories of power studies have significantly
advanced on Foucault's work. Broadly speaking, as accurate as these
categories can be applicable, there are now approximately three
phases/types of state power, all of whom existing concurrently in
societies towards different people. These include the following:

Societies of sovereignty/necro-politics (historical, Mbembe, Agamben)

Societies of discipline/biopower (Foucault)

Societies of control/psycho-politics (Deleuze, Han)

Thankfully, control societies and psycho-politics is likely of little
relevance to the criminal justice system. These are the "new" theories
of power, which authors like Mbembe would say are mostly applicable to
middle/upper class white folk in the Western world as sovereign power is
still applied to all those too unfortunate to be included in the above
group (like Mbembe's critique of Foucault). These theories get confusing
as it's unclear within Foucault scholarship what type of society groups
of people live in, especially since all types of societies can exist
within the same country at the same time. A state can seek traditional
disciplinary power in the military, control society trends in mid-upper
class college admissions, while exercising necropolitical power on black
and brown populations. I do not know a coherent theory that is inclusive
of all these, but I also haven't read too deeply in broader Foucauldian
scholarship.

I have noted all the above theories of power as its crucial to think of
what society we live in now in order to know if it is worse or better
then a more Foucauldian society in the context of trials/sentencing.
Many authors say that the prison industrial complex and plea bargaining
is an example of necro politics due to its focus on black and brown
folks in racialized ghettos, perpetuating the low-class status of
blackness, and that Foucault got it wrong. On a practical level,
disciplinary power might sound preferable to necropolitics, making a
link turn particularly potent.

#### 1.2.2 Trials Bad (Waiting Times)

Contention 2 is Trials Bad (Waiting Times). Pretrial detention is
obviously a bad experience--imprisonment in jail for weeks, if not
months, can cause people to lose their jobs from missing work,
apartments from nonpayment of rent, and/or access to their children
(with them potentially being put in foster care/orphanages). Given that
pretrial detention only occurs if you cannot pay bond, longer wait times
have a disproportionate harm on minorities who are more likely to be
less capable to pay bond (as well-off white folk will simply pay bail
and leave). If you cannot pay bail, your options are to plea bargain,
stay in jail awaiting trial, or pay a bail bondsman, the people who
often charge poor folk exorbitant charges and increase debt bondage for
poor communities similar to pay-day loan companies.

#### Plea bargains are [orders of magnitude]{.underline} more speedy and quick compared to trials -- this applies to both juvenile and adult courts

\*NOTE: this card is a reformatted version of the same card from in the
youth plea bargaining contention

Guilty Plea Hearing Characteristics A simple but informative way to
understand plea hearings is to evaluate their descriptive
characteristics. First was their length. As anticipated, [plea hearings
were **incredibly quick**, **consistent** with observational studies
spanning up to **four decades**]{.underline} (e.g., Miller et al., 1978;
Sanborn, 1992). [The hearings lasted about 6 to **8 min** in juvenile
court and about twice as long, but still only 13 min, in criminal
court]{.underline}. Although the plea hearings we observed were longer
than misdemeanor arraignment hearings (about 3 min; Smith & Maddan,
2011), [is it possible that plea validity can be adequately---much less
comprehensively---addressed in a **matter of minutes**]{.underline}? As
a result, [even juveniles, who **regularly** **fail** to fully
understand many aspects of their legal case]{.underline} (e.g., Grisso
et al., 2003; Zottoli et al., in press), [**ceded their rights** and
were convicted, often of **felony** crimes, in **mere
minutes**]{.underline}. In contrast, [the length of a criminal jury
trial is **11 h**r and 7 min]{.underline} (or 667 min; Sipes et al.,
1988). Thus, [the time it takes to convict a juvenile by trial is
roughly **95 times**]{.underline} [longer than the time it takes to
convict them by plea, and 51 times longer for an adult.]{.underline}
Hearing length could be construed as a proxy for a number of other
facets of the hearing, including defendant engagement, plea validity
review, or discussion of evidence and/or charges. Indeed, hearing length
was positively correlated with defendant participation and review of
details of all three of the plea validity components, an important
finding given that such a review is a core purpose of the hearing
itself. However, a closer examination revealed that this latter pattern
held only in the Virginia criminal court, suggesting that, for the
juveniles, longer hearings did not result in more detailed discussion of
the plea, its meaning, or its implications for the juveniles. Those
discussions in criminal court, as well, may have contributed to the plea
hearings' generally longer length in criminal relative to juvenile
court. In juvenile court, it is possible that judges focus on tangential
but related elements to the plea, such as parental/guardian
understanding and acceptance of the plea conditions (see Fountain &
Woolard, 2021) or the juveniles' prior criminal history, which may
affect their current charges and sentence. As found by Rodriguez (2010),
detained youth are more likely to have prior charges than those not
detained; at the Virginia juvenile court, we found that plea hearings
were longer for defendants in custody than those not in custody, though
this pattern did not emerge at the California juvenile or Virginia
criminal courts. Other hearing characteristics that differed between
courts may also have contributed to variations in length and, more
importantly, to defendants' likely understanding of their case, the
plea, and its consequences. Evidence was reviewed, for instance, in the
overwhelming majority of criminal cases but quite rarely in juvenile
courts. To our knowledge, a proffer (or presentation) of evidence is not
a required part of plea hearings. The American Bar Association's (1999)
Criminal Justice Standards for plea discussions and agreements does not
mention reviews of evidence in its listed responsibilities for judges,
prosecutors, and defenders. Yet research has consistently demonstrated
that stronger evidence increases the likelihood that individuals,
including adolescents, will accept a plea (Peterson-Badali &
Abramovitch, 1993; Redlich et al., 2016; Viljoen et al., 2005). And
while we do not know whether defense attorneys reviewed evidence with
juveniles before the hearings, a lack of review by judges is a striking
omission given the value that knowledge of the evidence may play and
given that judges in criminal court regularly provide such a review.
Likewise, in both the Virginia criminal court and the California
juvenile court, most defendants heard the charges read at the start,
whereas in the Virginia juvenile court, this occurred in only 6% to 19%
of the cases, depending on the severity of offenses to which the
juvenile pleaded. Even if defense attorneys explained the charges to
Virginia juvenile before the hearing, a re-review by the judge would
serve only to enhance juveniles' understanding, an especially crucial
need given consistent findings that highlight significant gaps in minor
defendants' knowledge of legal proceedings, including the plea (see
Grisso et al., 2003; Redlich et al., 2019; Zottoli & Daftary-Kapur,
2019). Without substantial explanation, it is unlikely that juveniles
fully understand the process and the consequences of the plea, a view
shared by some courtroom actors (Sanborn, 1992; Woestehoff et al.,
2019).

#### 1.2.3 Court Clog

Contention 3 is Court Clog. The core generic aff argument is court clog
and is a go-to argument when researching the topic area. It will be the
first argument you likely read during aff research, and likely one of
the strongest arguments.

Semi-routinely in debate you will discover that some ideas are so
manifestly stupid that its nigh near impossible to get accurate
cost-estimates or impact cards for the idea, as most intelligent people
prioritize analyzing much more plausible, much less stupid ideas.
Broadly speaking, plea bargaining abolition is one of these ideas---plea
bargaining is so embedded and widespread that to do something different
would be disastrous. The scholarly consensus is that debate on whether
plea bargaining could be abolished was one in the 1970s-2000s, when both
the practice and mass incarceration were becoming widespread. To abolish
it now would be a fool's errand. This is so true that prolific writers
on plea bargain abolition like Albert Alschuler have given up and
thought abolition to be impossible. Regardless, we have some limited
cost estimates listed below.

#### Plea bargain abolition would cost \$850 million in 1983. Adjusted for inflation, plea bargain abolition would cost \~\$2.75 billion

Bargaining System\", US DOJ Office of Justice Programs,

Abstract Coupled with sentencing guidelines, this waiver bargaining
could treat together two issues that deserve this unified treatment:
sentencing reform and plea negotiations. Another way to end the
excessive dependence on the guilty plea would be to spend the money
necessary to implement our constitutional ideals without shortcuts. [The
United States could provide 3-day jury trials to all felony defendants
who reach the trial stage by adding no more than \$850 million to annual
criminal justice expenditures]{.underline}. [The actual cost would
probably be far less than this figure, however, because many defendants
would plead guilty without bargaining and many cases could be tried in
less than 3 days]{.underline}. Still [another approach might be to
simplify American trial procedures in the interest of making trials more
available]{.underline}. Contrary to common understanding, the
constitution would not preclude a substitution of mixed tribunals of
professional and lay judges for criminal juries in State-court
proceedings. Less sweeping reforms might also be possible. Four hundred
fifty footnotes, many containing references, are included. (Author

When most people think of the American justice system, they likely
picture a courtroom with lawyers, a judge, and a jury waiting to
determine the facts of the case and provide a just outcome. But the
majority of people "found guilty" in America never stand trial: their
fate is determined in a courthouse hallway or prosecutor's office via a
quick conversation between attorneys. [Plea bargaining]{.underline} is
more a part of the American justice system than the formal trial and, in
fact, [makes up the **vast majority** of criminal justice
transactions]{.underline} today. [Only **2 percent** of federal criminal
cases---and a similar number of state cases---are brought to trial. More
than **90 percent** of convictions, at both federal and state levels,
are the result of guilty pleas]{.underline}. Plea bargaining is so
fundamental to the system that even [in **1970**]{.underline}, [Chief
Justice]{.underline} Warren [Burger]{.underline} of the U.S. Supreme
Court [**estimated** that a **10 percent** reduction in guilty pleas
would require **doubling** the amount of judicial capacity in the
system]{.underline}. Scholars in recent years have suggested that [the
criminal legal system could be **brought to a halt** by a **mass
refusal** to plead guilty]{.underline}. And yet little is known about
plea bargaining. Pleas are offered and retracted at the unfettered
discretion of prosecutors. Bargains themselves are undocumented and
largely unchallenged, save for a few formal questions meant to establish
that the plea is "voluntary, intelligent, and knowing." To understand
plea bargaining, then, we must depend on a small but growing body of
research. Through interviews, data gathered by courts, and other means,
scholars are attempting to understand the factors that influence plea
bargaining as well as whether a plea bargain is a "bargain" at all.
These studies are vital to understanding a process that is so central to
how the criminal legal system currently operates, but they remain
woefully inadequate and incomplete. The sheer lack of trials, for
example, means that it is difficult to find analogous cases to compare
to those that end in pleas. In addition, the dynamic and recursive
nature of bargaining is difficult to isolate into discrete questions for
study. Finally, the most important voices---the people subject to these
bargains---are largely absent from these studies. Instead, data is
provided by police, courts, prosecutors, and jails. This one-sided
understanding of the bargain explains a good deal about how the legal
characteristics of a case, or pressures such as increasing caseloads,
drive prosecutorial bargaining, but it offers little insight into the
reasons that people trade their right to a trial for a faster and more
certain conviction. But why does it matter? The history of the American
justice system is a history of mass incarceration, with wildly disparate
consequences for Black and white people. We are faced with substantial
evidence that people are put in untenable positions after arrest. They
are kept in jails away from their families and communities if they
cannot afford cash bail or an attorney to argue for them. And although
representation is guaranteed, the tremendous caseload borne by public
defenders means that "representation" before trial is likely to be
perfunctory and impersonal. Pretrial incarceration has been definitively
linked to the likelihood of conviction, and most convictions are
obtained via plea. And although the Supreme Court has indicated that
even knowing you may be put to death if you face trial is not "coercive"
pressure to plead guilty, it is difficult to say that an incarcerated
person faced with the loss of their income, housing, family, and
community is truly free to make a choice. Even after people return to
their communities, a conviction---whether it stems from a guilty plea or
a jury verdict---carries collateral consequences that will follow them
for years, if not the rest of their lives. Today, the American justice
system is in crisis, but it is also in a moment of unique opportunity.
This review and analysis of the available literature on plea
bargaining---released by Vera and the Safety and Justice
Challenge---represents decades of work by dozens of scholars. It brings
light to the shadowed hallways where the majority of justice is
transacted and new attention to the ways the criminal legal system has
become an ad hoc administrative process. Introduction The common
narrative in popular culture is that criminal justice is meted out in
courtrooms around the country. Facts about a particular case inevitably
emerge from adversarial proceedings in which prosecutors and defense
attorneys go to battle in open court over matters of fact and law,
juries decide whether people are guilty or not guilty, and judges
determine appropriate punishments.1 People have their days in court, and
the public---including victims, if there are any---witness whether
justice is done.2 In fact, [criminal trials are rare]{.underline}.3
Instead, [most criminal cases that result in conviction---**97 percent**
in large urban state courts in 2009, and **90 percent** in federal court
in 2014---are adjudicated through guilty pleas]{.underline}.4 Of these,
researchers estimate that [more than **90 percent** are a result of plea
bargaining]{.underline}---an informal and unregulated process by which
prosecutors and defense counsel negotiate charging and sentencing
concessions in exchange for guilty pleas and waivers of constitutionally
guaranteed trial rights.5 Indeed, by one estimate, [a criminal case is
disposed of by plea bargaining **every two seconds** during a typical
work day in America]{.underline}.6 Negotiated deals to resolve criminal
cases are so ubiquitous that [Justice]{.underline} Anthony
[Kennedy]{.underline} of the U.S. Supreme Court [stated]{.underline} in
2012 that "[criminal justice today is for the most part a system of
pleas, not a system of trials]{.underline}."7 Plea deals---which are
entirely within the discretion of a prosecutor to offer (or
accept)---typically include one or more of the following: › the
dismissal of one or more charges, and/or agreement to a conviction to a
lesser offense (known as "charge bargaining"); › an agreement to a more
lenient sentence, which can cover both type of sanction---custodial or
community-based---and length (known as "sentence bargaining"); and › an
agreement to stipulate to a version of events that omits certain facts
that would statutorily expose a person to harsher penalties (known as
"fact bargaining").8 Plea negotiations can be quick and straightforward
or long and complicated---or anywhere in between.9 When there are no
legal issues in dispute, or in cases in which it is likely that the
prosecution will prevail, plea negotiations can be superficial---with
people taking given deals without any negotiation or counteroffer.10
This is especially so in cases of misdemeanors, infractions, and other
lesser offenses for which there are often standard dispositions
routinely offered and accepted with little, if any, actual deliberation.
(See "Misdemeanor justice and plea bargains" on page 16.) Often, in more
complex cases where available evidence is subject to conflicting
interpretations, and/or where sentencing stakes are higher, negotiations
can be lengthier---potentially occurring over many weeks and months.11
In a smaller proportion of cases, no actual offer or negotiation occurs,
and people plead guilty without any specific promises or assurances from
the prosecution---called variously taking an "open plea," taking a
"blind plea," or "pleading to the sheet."12 In whatever form it takes,
plea bargaining remains a low-visibility, off- the-record, and informal
process that usually occurs in conference rooms and courtroom
hallways---or through private telephone calls or e-mails--- far away
from the prying eyes and ears of open court.13 Bargains are usually
struck with no witnesses present and made without investigation,
testimony, impartial fact-finding, or adherence to the required burden
of proof.14 Moreover, little to no documentation exists of the
bargaining process that takes place between initial charge and a
person's formal admission of guilt in open court, and final plea deals
that close out cases are themselves rarely written down or otherwise
recorded.15 As such, plea deals, and the process that produces them, are
largely unreviewable and subject to little public scrutiny.16 Thus,
despite the high frequency with which plea deals are used, most
people---aside from the usual courtroom actors---understand neither the
mechanics of plea bargaining nor the reasons so many people decide to
plead guilty. Plea bargaining has, however, become the central focus of
a growing, but still small, body of empirical research. In recent years,
mounting concerns about plea bargaining's role in encouraging the
widespread forfeiture of constitutionally guaranteed trial rights and
associated procedural protections---and its critical role in fueling
mass incarceration--- has stimulated further urgency in understanding
how the process works. Indeed, an array of questions regarding its
fairness have emerged. Over the last few decades, prosecutorial leverage
in plea negotiations has increased exponentially as changes in
substantive law have bolstered criminal penalties and given prosecutors
a wider range of choices to use when filing charges (such as mandatory
penalties, sentencing enhancements, and more serious yet duplicative
crimes already well covered by existing law). But increased exposure to
harsher penalties has not been matched with increased procedural
protections for defendants. Prosecutors' wide powers in plea bargaining
still go largely unchecked, and there are no meaningful oversight
mechanisms or procedural safeguards to protect against unfair or
coercive practices, raising fears about arbitrariness and inequality.
Given this lack of regulation, concern has also grown over the extent to
which innocent people are regularly being induced to plead guilty, as
well as plea bargaining's role in perpetuating racial and ethnic
disparities in criminal case outcomes---for example, plea bargaining
practices that send more Black people to prison or jail than similarly
situated white people.17 Plea bargaining's full impact on the legal
system and justice-involved people remains unknown, but empirical
research on this little understood yet immensely influential practice
has begun to emerge. In order to provide an accessible summary of
existing research to policymakers and the public, the Vera Institute of
Justice (Vera) examined a body of empirical studies that has developed
around plea bargaining. Although this review is not exhaustive, it
provides a picture not only of the current state of scholarship on plea
bargaining, but also of the gaps in knowledge that must be filled. As
this report will discuss, studies appear to fall into seven main focus
areas, primarily examining either of two broad questions: (1) which
factors most influence the plea bargaining decision-making process?; and
(2) what is the impact of plea bargaining on case outcomes? The seven
focus areas covered by this report include the following. › Coercive
factors. A number of studies examine whether the punishing circumstances
of pretrial detention or the threat of onerous sentences---specifically,
the death penalty---play an outsized role in inducing and expediting
guilty pleas. › Legal case characteristics. Another extensive body of
work looks at how legal case characteristics---severity of charge, prior
record, evidentiary factors---influence the type of plea offers that are
made. Systemic inequities. There is a growing body of research that
considers the influence of demographic characteristics in determining
plea outcomes. These studies primarily look at the potential existence
of conscious or unconscious biases that may create disadvantage and
inequality across race, ethnicity, gender, or age. › The criminal law.
Another body of work looks at the organization, structure, and content
of the criminal code to understand how the criminal law---including the
existence and type of structured sentencing schemes---can affect the
likelihood and substance of a plea deal. › Caseloads. Some studies have
tested the common assumption that the frequent use of plea deals is, at
least partly, a function of heavy caseloads among prosecutors and a
resultant pressure to hasten the disposal of as many cases as possible.
(No research considered the impact of defenders' caseloads on plea
bargaining.) › Trial penalty. A substantial body of the literature
explores the so-called "trial penalty" (or "plea discount")---that is,
the difference between a criminal sentence produced by guilty plea
versus by trial. Much of this work is narrowly based on the assumption
that plea decisions rely on anticipated trial outcomes, such that the
higher the penalty (or larger the discount) the higher the likelihood of
a guilty plea. › Innocence. Finally, given the potential benefits to
people of accepting a plea deal, a small body of research has considered
the extent to which innocent people may be coerced into pleading guilty
to avoid receiving a "trial penalty" if they fail to prove their cases
at trial. [Whether people are charged with serious crimes or low-level
misdemeanors, whether they are before busy city courts or slower-paced
rural ones, they will likely resolve their cases by negotiated pleas.
Plea bargaining is the **de facto system** of justice in
America]{.underline}. But despite decades of scholarship, little is
ultimately known about how it works or why people plead. This review of
contemporary scholarship only offers mixed clues about the criminal
legal system's primary dispositional process. Although there is evidence
that most people receive more favorable sentencing outcomes through plea
bargaining than they would if they had taken their cases to trial, the
exact contours of how such bargains are reached, and the
factors---whether individual, legal, institutional, or demographic---
that ultimately play a key role in influencing plea outcomes remain both
ambiguous and opaque. What exists instead is a mix of complicated,
nuanced, and sometimes contradictory research findings. In order to
bring plea bargaining out of the shadows and ensure its equitable use,
more transparency is needed about the process by which most cases are
concluded so that safeguards can be put in place to protect people from
its misuse. 8Vera Institute of Justice Law of plea bargaining: An
overview

These cost estimates are not of the highest quality; and it's hard to
think of how we would solve problems related to law professional
shortages or estimate the cost of more simple things, such as paying for
bigger parking lots at court houses (often located in space limited
downtown areas) or the annual cost of paying many, many more jurors.
There would also be downward pressure on the amount of convictions due
to increased prosecutorial screening out of low-level criminals (such as
litterbugs or potentially soft drug users). However, in an absolute
sense, the cost is not that bad, especially considering that the US
discretionary budget for Congress is \~\$1.6 trillion and the \~\$2.75
billion price tag is pennies compared to whatever tax cuts or DOGE
inefficient "efficiency cuts." For reference, the \~\$2.75 billion price
tag would be less than the annual cost of NASA, a relatively small
government agency compared to the Social Security Administration or the
Department of Defense. Obviously, these are all arguments the neg ought
to be making when answering court clog, but these are all good things to
be aware of if you're running this contention.

The issue of court clog is inherently linked to whether a bigger system
is possible, particularly without spending ridiculous sums of money.
Assuming a trial system is exorbitantly expensive, the impacts are the
following (a) can't solve neg impacts because the system is broken, (b)
increases wait times that harm people waiting for justice, and (c)
expenditures trades off with other, more valuable social goods.

Not being able to solve obviously means there's less neg offense to deal
with. Increased waiting times can be impacted out with the evidence in
the "trials bad (waiting time)." These are paired contentions: if trial
wait times bad is a true argument, that implies a linear impact of those
impacts we already see in the status quo being applied to everyone,
which is an intrinsic harm even if eliminating plea bargaining didn't
clog up the courts with a bigger caseload. However, if "neg causes court
clog" and "trial wait times bad" are both true arguments, then you have
a very potent contention, as the court clog increasing wait times
multiplies the harms of those wait times (as the wait times are now
substantially longer). For the final impact, to the extent that a
program is extremely expensive, it decreases our budget for other goods
(such as rehabilitation, poverty reduction, schooling, etc.).

A separate, more small-scale impact is your inability to exercise the
"speedy" part of your trial rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
However, using this impact is self-defeating given that plea bargainers
didn't even get a trial to begin with, so a subpar, slow trial is a huge
upgrade to no trial at all. A good neg response you'd need to contend
with is to "not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."

The only problem besides the link is uniqueness given that to varying
degrees, the courts are already clogged with severe backlogs in some
court systems (which seems to implicate the strength of the contention).
However, there are degrees of uniqueness erased with some overly
simplistic responses to arguments, such as a yes/no court clog now
paradigm. Given the nature of a criminal justice system in a country of
300+ million people, delays, wait times, and some degree of court clog
is inevitable, and as the aff will argue, a lack of wait times might
mean the integrity of due process has been damaged due to expedited,
"assembly-line justice." However, the brink paradigm of yes/no court
clog hides the fact that most debate impacts are a matter of degree, not
kind, such as extreme climate change or extreme economic decline causing
bad impacts - neither are binary lever switches indicating yes/no good
economy or climate but rather impacts predicted when the status quo
reaches extreme degrees of bad stuff occurring.

As aff evidence already presumes when describing the impacts of court
clog, some, relatively small degree of court clog already exists, with
the degree of which varying depending on whether we focus on
immigration, civil, criminal, appeal, tribal, constitutional, etc.
courts. Immigration courts may be clogged with a deluge of cases while
civil court may need budget cuts from their caseload being too small,
but importantly, each individual court's caseload does not directly
impact each other's caseload, and neither of these courts are part of
the "criminal justice system," so immigration/civil court caseloads are
mostly, but not entirely irrelevant to the criminal caseload.

Additionally, law professionals specialize, adding difficulties if a
judge specializing in immigration law, corporate bankruptcy, family law,
etc. was required to shift their practice and expertise to another
field. Of course, judges are less specialized than lawyers given that
judges often need to address a variety of cases, but civil judges are
imperfect substitutes for criminal cases.

The court system type distinction and law professional's specialization
have two implications:

1.  Worse aff impacts --- criminal court clog has minimal implications
    for the integrity of non-criminal courts like patent courts (key to
    the economy) or appeal/constitutional courts (key to civil rights).

2.  Better counterplan responses --- a common neg counterplan is to
    solve the scarce judicial resources problem causing plea bargaining
    simply by increasing funding to make those resource plentiful.
    However, given the subdivided court system, someone like an elder
    law lawyer cannot easily become a defense attorney, let alone a
    criminal trial justice, meaning there's both a professional shortage
    as well as a resource shortage, the former of whom cannot be easily
    resolved via increased funding (given funding cannot apparate more
    prosecutors, defense attorneys/public defenders, judges, law clerks,
    etc. into existence).

#### 1.2.4 Abolition Aff

Contention 4 is the Abolition Aff. This contention is the "reject the
system, burn it all down" kritikal affirmative, desiring to move beyond
the prison system. Plea bargain driven mass incarceration is likely
indefensible, and it's a bad praxis to defend something that cause such
great suffering and racial harms. Some sides on some topics are unworthy
of debating, such as the 2010 PF resolution that advocated for building
an Islamic cultural center near the 9/11 museum. The topic sparked such
large backlash based on the potential harms towards Muslim debaters via
debating the topic that the topic was retracted. Since 2010 there has
been a stronger culture of kritikal affirmatives, and that option was
(and likely still is) nonexistent for PF, hence the public desire to
swap the topic. However, in LD (unlike PF), there is an implicit,
unrecognized option to choose not to defend the topic, as seen most
commonly in identity politics kritikal affirmatives. Abolition is a
similar argument usable on both the aff and neg, which can make the
topic particularly confusing, but also allows kritikal debates with both
aff and neg kritikal literature to advocate for the best option to
resolve the harms of the criminal justice system. A full discussion of
the potential justifiable reasons for intentionally not defending a
topic is beyond the scope of this topic analysis, but I would recommend
reading the article linked

#### Definition of the Carceral State

**Hong 25** \[Esther K. Hong, Associate Professor of Law at ASU, 2025,
"The Carceral State(s)," Michigan Journal of Race and Law,
https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1414&context=mjrl\]/Kankee

INTRODUCTION [The carceral state is **everywhere**]{.underline}. [The
term]{.underline} has become a "staple\[\] of . . . contemporary
punishment and society literature."1 It is prevalent in legal
scholarship, increasingly appearing in critiques about punishment and
other forms of social control in various areas of the law, including
criminal, immigration, juvenile, family regulation, and education law.2
It has become a colloquial term among activists, advocates, and
journalists,3 and its significance (whether lauded or critiqued) is
recognized in commentaries of various political ideologies.4 It is also
making its mark in legal casebooks,5 legal filings,6 interviews with
politicians, and congressional hearings.7 While the term [evokes
Foucault's "**carceral archipelago**]{.underline}" from 1975,8 its
prolific usage is much more recent. One scholar credited Marie
Gottschalk with its popularization,9 who began writing about the
carceral state circa 2006.10 But even with its pervasive usage over
nearly two decades, the defi- nition, conceptualization, and
theorization of the carceral state are far from settled. This Article
analyzes and contributes to this ongoing work by under- scoring just how
varied, decentralized, and fluid ideas about the carceral state are.
There are differing histories, core traits, motivations, reach, and
impact. There are at least three factors that contribute to this
diversity of views. First, in the majority of instances when the term
"carceral state" appears in academic and mainstream sources, it is not
explicitly defined. This absence is so pronounced that scholars of
different disciplines have commented on it. 11 For example, historian
Dan Berger observed the oddity in "how little of the published work or
conference sessions on the topic \[of the carceral state\] engaged in
this most basic act" of defining it. 12 This preferred practice of not
defining the carceral state continues. For example, in perhaps one of
the most recent high-profile uses of the term, Justice Sotomayor in her
dissent in Utah v. Strieff, 13 used the term "carceral state" without an
explicit definition. She opined that the majority's holding regarding
Fourth Amendment searches would lead to distorted interactions between
police and individuals that implied that one is "not a citizen of a
democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be
cataloged." 14 Other lower courts that have since quoted Justice
Sotomayor also have not defined the term. 15 That so many commentators
of the carceral state do not set forth an express definition keeps the
concept fluid and open-ended. Writers may assume that readers just
understand what the carceral state is, either from its common usage or
from the context in which the term appears. But this practice inherently
leaves it open to many interpretations. Second, in the limited instances
when the carceral state has been expressly defined or conceptualized in
legal and social science scholarship, they have differed from one
another.16 [There are at least four broad categories of
conceptualizations that all allude to something that is inherently
wrong, dysfunctional, or harmful]{.underline}. For example, [the
**carceral state** may signify a certain punitive phenomenon, such as
**mass incarceration**]{.underline}. [It may refer to all or specific
state practices that **punish**, **surveil**, and/or **control**
individuals. It may signify a type of governance, government, or
**governmentality**, or a logic or ideology that permeates throughout
society or the entire state]{.underline}. This practice too signals that
[the carceral state concept does not have a unified, overarching
construction]{.underline}. Third, and most significantly, scholars have
a wide range of insights on the core and significant characteristics of
the carceral state. 17 This diver- gence is apparent in its explicit
definitions and conceptualizations. But more tellingly, they are evident
in the descriptions that accompany references to the carceral state. As
the preferred usage of the term is in its undefined form, the context
reveals the commentator's understanding of the carceral state. These
contextual clues in turn show that ideas about its core characteristics
span a broad spectrum.18 There are varying descriptions of its
composition, relationship with the prison-industrial complex (if any),
size, form, and age. Also, while many prominent [scholars view the
**discriminatory** actions and effects of the carceral state as its key
feature and harm]{.underline}, there remains notable differences in the
intent, type, and scope of this discrimination. [This diverse
understanding of the carceral state matters for both its theoretical
development and real-world applications]{.underline}. 19 First, it
speaks directly to the theorization of the carceral state. Rather than
progressing towards a single overarching theory, there will be many
theoretical frameworks or versions since some views cannot be reconciled
or merged. This analysis may help solidify the boundaries between the
different understandings of the carceral state. Furthermore, while it is
not unusual for popular terms and concepts to have diverse meanings and
frameworks, 20 the theoretical development of the carceral state also
conveys a distinct, broader message. The usage of the term reflects
scholars' growing reluctance to use traditional labels for state
institutions, systems, laws, or processes. The term often serves as an
epithet, immediately evoking their illegitimacy and dysfunction, such as
discrimination, corruption, and oppression. It also underscores how
normalized and pervasive certain state-inflicted or state-sponsored
harms have become. And yet, that so many commentators have such
different conceptions of the carceral state should prompt reflection on
why it is so difficult to come to a consensus about what exactly is
wrong with our current systems, structures, laws, or governance.

#### 1.2.5 Trials Bad (Victims).

Contention 5 is Trials Bad (Victims). This contention is similar to the
pathologized subject contention, but it doesn't base its justifications
on Foucauldian theory. It says that victims being forced to testify in
trials in order to get a conviction causes a traumatic and is net
negative to their mental health

#### 1.2.6 Jury Duty Bad

Contention 6 is Jury Duty Bad. This contention mostly exists as a
preemptive link turn to win arguments about trials being unfair/racist
(if poor people don't get on jury), or that trials are too expensive (if
the neg fiats that poor people get on juries and will be compensated
more). The former helps out with the "Jim Crow Juries Bad" helps with
the contention and the latter helps with the "court clog" contention.
The main offense is that juries can worsen the poverty of poor folk by
causing them to lose pay; however, this the status quo mostly already
"solves" this problem given that the courts already exclude these people
from serving due to financial hardship. Many of the racialized harms of
trials already exist via plea bargaining, and trials likely
comparatively improve the situation (even if they're not perfect). These
arguments implicate neg solvency more so then they are intrinsically
winning arguments you ought to always extend in the 2AR.

#### 1.2.7 Jim Crow Juries Bad

Contention 7 is Jim Crow Juries Bad. Black jurors are highly excluded
from juror summons rolls (due to quasi-race-neutral economic reasons in
terms of you're less likely to be included if you're poor, a black folk
are a lot more likely to be poor). Similarly, lawyers are much more
likely to dismiss black jurors from a potential jury (again with more
quasi-race neutral reasons). Both factors contribute to highly white
juries being highly influential on black and brown folks' court
outcomes, which offers great potential for implicit racial bias.

Evidence about whether all white juries are inferior to plea bargains
via mostly white lawyers is not great. Both cause racialized harms, and
the trials have stronger safeguard mechanisms like appeals, evidentiary
standards, or a
[token](https://www.acslaw.org/expertforum/racial-discrimination-in-jury-selection/)
black/brown person. However, the generalized stats about the trial
penalty for black and brown folk is comparatively more severe compared
to white people, which could be explained via the white juries argument.

#### 1.2.8 Crime

Contention 8 is Crime. Plea bargains increase the severity of
convictions, help secure informant deals, and can result in
co-defendants testifying against each other (which is the premise of the
game theory experiment of the prisoners' dilemma). All of these *could*
potentially be the cause of a reduction in crime. In a roundabout
manner, you could make arguments in favor of mass incarceration as a
means of preventing crime, especially given the fact that crime rates by
almost all metrics are at the lowest point in decades.

#### 1.2.9 Circumvention

Contention 9 is Circumvention. This is a core negative argument as it
implicates neg solvency, especially when paired with court clog.
Experiments in plea bargaining abolition have often found that either
the trial rate skyrockets, or the trial rate doesn't change due to
defendants engaging in open pleas as opposed to negotiated plea
bargains. Open pleas involve skipping the process of plea offers and
counter offers, with the defendant pleading guilty relatively early
without negotiating with the prosecutor over the terms of a plea deal.
It's a hope to be in the prosector's good graces via minimalizing work
for them, and this is entirely legal to do even if plea bargaining was
banned, as you cannot have a blanket rule to stop people from pleading
guilty to avoid the trial even if you could have a rule against
negotiating a bargain.

### 1.3 Negative Topic Analysis

#### 1.3.1 Informants and False Testimony

Contention 1 is Informants and False Testimony. Informants are criminals
legally allowed to maintain their criminal persona and actively commit
crimes in order to the justice system to acquire information from the
informant to catch other, hopefully worse, criminals. In (formerly)
popular media, such as the 2004 *Starsky and Hutch* remake, you can see
Snoop Dog/Huggy Bear as an example of an informant, both in the sense
that he routinely provides information to and aids the investigation of
the police, and in the sense that he is untrustworthy and steals all the
money at the end of the movie. Informants are a double-edged sword as
they can reduce crime by aiding the prosecution of "bigger fish" higher
up in a criminal organization (like the mafia or cartel), but they're
given an implicit license to commit crimes and the information they
provide is not always accurate and could result in false convictions.

The problem is that informants are untrustworthy, commit crimes, and
sometimes intentionally provide false information (to target criminal
rivals) BUT drug enforcement and to a lesser degree police/FBI are
heavily reliant on informants for their operations, making it hard for
law enforcement to address the above problems. The reliance and the
phenomena of "loving your rat" can result in bad police behavior and
lackluster investigations. Additionally, informants are often a net
negative to law enforcement, causing cultures of insecurity, not
trusting law enforcement, and decreasing the sense of fairness of the
law (given that justice can be bargained for if it's convenient for the
cops). All of these cause a disparate impact on minority communities,
often increasing crime levels. The informants themselves are obviously
coerced into doing this and often die or suffer horrific experiences in
the process of being undercover, which is a secondary impact.

One of the main means for the justice system to acquire informants is
via plea bargains---routinely in television like *Breaking Bad*,
low-level criminals are caught and obliged to cooperate to catch
higher-level criminals in exchange for leniency. There's few
non-coercive means of law enforcement to garner informants as "snitches
get stitches," which is why plea bargaining is often the crucial source
of informants.

#### 1.3.2 Mass Incarceration

It\'s the one business where you really do have a captive audience. Just
lock them up, throw away the key, and watch the profits roll in. ...
We\'ll have America back the way we want it to be: white, paranoid, and
happy to burn anyone that looks different. ... The prison industrial
complex: a real American success story that they can\'t outsource. --
GTA V

Contention 2 is Mass Incarceration. For those unfamiliar, since the
1970s and the War on Drugs, the same period when SCOTUS said plea
bargaining was constitutional, the US prison system has "exploded" in
size, becoming the largest in the world. Statistics on the unprecedented
increase in the US prison system are both readily available in this
contentions evidence and on the internet---this phenomenon has been
described as one of the greatest human rights violations in the world
and is actively criticized by the UN. Authors such as Michelle Alexander
have described this as a new system of mass racial subjugation similar
to Jim Crow or slavery due to its disproportionate impact on black and
brown folk, contributing to legal, yet informal racial "caste" system by
associating black folk with criminality and decreasing their legal
rights.

Plea bargaining is crucial in mass incarceration due to its ability to
get through caseloads faster. Who knew it was easy to send millions to
prison and give up their constitutional rights to the trial process that
would potentially prove them innocent if you threaten them with greater
punishment if you exercise those rights? If plea bargaining, the
mechanism that processes \~90-95% of cases, didn't exist, the criminal
justice system would explode, and by extension the prison industrial
complex and mass incarceration. The over criminalization of black and
brown communities is contingent on a legal system that permits their
prosecution. To some degree this contention "bites the bullet" and
concedes the court clog link, as sabotaging and crashing a system that
produces injustice is good. This cannot be stressed enough; if the
system is so bad the UN says it's an egregious human rights violation,
being concerned about the new system being slow is a non-response.
There's cognitive dissonance between the fact that the US has the
largest prison system in history (more so than the Stalinist Soviet
Union or Mao's China), with a devastating impact on black and brown
folk, and saying "too bad, so sad" the courts will be clogged if we
actually gave everyone justice, so just deal with it and pretend
everything is okay.

For reference, this contention *heavily* overlaps with the two racism
contentions below.

#### 1.3.3 Advantage Counterplan

NOTE: If you are skimming through the topic analysis, I would highly
recommend reading the above section "Note on Counter Plans and Required
Neg Advocacy" before running this counterplan.

Contention 3 is the Advantage Counterplan. The all-inclusive advantage
counterplan in this brief is highly utilizable for philosophical based
frameworks about coercion and rights-protection or smaller
non-imprisonment impacts like informants or white collar/crime
pedophiles. None of these are reliant on the mass, systemic change of
the prison-industrial complex. Do not run this with racism (particularly
the critical version) or mass incarceration as the extra-resolutional
solvency of the counterplan would also solve your topical reasons why to
plea bargaining is bad, meaning a permutation would make the counterplan
self-defeating.

For reference, the first two counterplan planks are generally useful in
all almost all situations for answering court clog/limited resources
arguments, as they solve the system-level harms related to plea
bargaining so that everyone can exercise their jury trial rights. The
next three planks relate to solving mass incarceration to avoid trial
tax/increased incarceration arguments, because if trials have worse
punishments and you don't win that trials reduce the total number of
convictions (through higher standards of evidence), then everyone is
punished for longer periods, the harms of which need not be explained.

There are only two good responses to the counterplan, law professional
shortage (described earlier in the topic analysis), and increased
spending bad due to inflation. However, uniqueness overwhelms the link
with other status quo events that are increasing inflation, such as the
most intense trade war since the 1930s, the recently passed One Big
Beautiful Bill Act (which adds several trillion dollars to the national
debt), or Trump potentially firing the Federal Reserve chair (thereby
threatening the credibility of the US financial system). In the
non-debate world, spending huge lumps on criminal justice given the
risky inflation situation is a horrible idea, but in terms of the
counterplan, inflation and spending-related inflation risks are already
sufficiently high that the counterplan cannot make it much worse (making
spending bad arguments against the counterplan non-unique).

If people question the legitimacy of the counterplan, think of a
well-to-do family's birthday party who have the financial means to
afford another cake, but don't budget for it, leaving the partygoers to
ration the scarce cake resources to maximize the efficiency of cake
allocation, leaving \~90% of the partygoers with cardboard and frosting.
On a fundamental level, it's patently obvious you'd assess this a
horrible party---there's easily enough money to buy a sheet cake at
Albertsons to avoid this distributional low-cake supply chicanery. Why
do we accept the claim that rationing is inevitable because (a) the
amount of cake is fixed and we cannot get more, and (b) millions must
attend the party without cake? If it's true the family is truly poor and
is lacking in the cake party budget, why not avoid inviting extra people
you know you cannot feed gluttonous goodness. Its beyond obvious cake is
not the justice system, but one would think we would have higher
standards for people receiving the death penalty and life-in-prison than
a quinceañera.

#### 1.3.4 Racism (Stock). 

Contention 4 is Racism (Stock). This contention is focused on the harms
of plea bargaining and mass incarceration on black and brown folk, as
well as their associated communities.

#### 1.3.5 Racism (Critical)

Contention 5 is Racism (Critical). This contention is highly premised on
the ideas of Foucault and the construction of criminality. If you read
the aff version of this contention, you may be confused in terms of how
Foucauldian is applicable, especially when the argument there was that
disciplinary power is neglected in the criminal justice system now in
favor or retributivism and necropolitics. However, the coercive aspects
of guilty pleas where you "admit your sins" via the confession allow
blackness to be more easily conflated with criminality. An assembly line
of mostly black and brown bodies being compelled do admit
blameworthiness for something they did not do, while having all the
judicial hallmarks of voluntariness and individual agency, helps
legitimize and white wash the prison industrial complex as something
race neutral, and by extension, eases thinking of the hyperincarceration
of black and brown folk as something natural. Below is a card with an
explanation of social death that may be valuable to read for context
whenever engaging in critical anti-blackness literature.

#### Social death explained

Death and the Relationship Between School and Incarceration," ISSSI

Why Social Death **[Social death]{.underline}** is a concept popularized
by Patterson (1982), who [used]{.underline} it [to refer to the way
those who were enslaved]{.underline} across cultures and across time
[are deemed "**social nonpersons**]{.underline}" (p. 40) [either as
"someone who did not belong because he is an outsider" or "someone who
became an outsider because]{.underline} [he did not (or no longer)
belonged]{.underline}" (p. 44). Scholars such as
**[Sexton]{.underline}** (2010; 2016) [use social death to specifically
describe anti- Blackness]{.underline}, i.e. [the infliction of violences
on African Americans by equating them and treating them as less than
human]{.underline}. Sexton (2010) argues that ["...because blackness
serves as the basis of]{.underline} [enslavement in the logic of a
transnational political and legal culture, it **permanently
destabilizes** the position of any nominally free black
population]{.underline}" (p. 36). Other scholars adapted the concept of
social death to describe the phenomenon of incarceration. Sowle (1993)
uses social death to describe the rise of US penitentiaries in the 1930s
as a way to socially isolate criminals who "were germs infecting the
body politic" (p. 528). Guenther (2013) discusses social death in terms
of solitary confinement, in which incarcerated individuals are forcibly
separated from human connection. Price (2015) also argues that "to be
sentenced to prison is to be sentenced to social death," though in
addition to the mistreatment in prison he adds the lingering stigma of
incarceration after release (p. 5). Rios (2011) briefly mentions social
death in his conclusion to refer to the six of his participants who
ended up in prison and the "social incapacitation" or "microdoses of
social death" that prevented all his participants "from functioning,
thriving, and feeling a sense of dignity in their daily interactions
with institutional forces" (p. 160). Cacho's (2012) iteration of social
death centers on a priori criminalization. In her version of social
death[, an individual's everyday behavior is criminalized, not because
the individual is acting like a criminal, but is by their very
existence, criminal]{.underline}. She uses her concept of social death
to [conceptualize the violences of labeling, surveillance, and
punishment of gang members, undocumented immigrants, and suspected
terrorists to show "how human value is made unintelligible through
racialized, sexualized, specialized, and state-sanctioned
violences]{.underline}" (Cacho, 2012, p. 4). It is this
conceptualization of social death that better describes the experiences
of participants in my study. There are two reasons [social death is a
more suitable metaphor for]{.underline} [understanding participants'
experiences compared to the school-to-prison pipeline]{.underline}.
First, social death in itself offers a more in-depth understanding of
criminalization and dehumanization and the interaction between the two
compared to other frameworks. Second, I use social death as a key
component of an ecological model to describe the experiences of
participants in the larger study that these case studies draw from.
Despite its infrequent use, social death is the best lens through which
to understand the experiences of the six participants compared to more
well-known frameworks. While no framework is as prolific as the
school-to-prison pipeline, Rios' (2011) youth control complex is also
commonly used to conceptualize the criminalization of youth.6 His
framework presents an alternative to the pipeline's linear causal
trajectory. And unlike the school to prison pipeline metaphor, which is
empirically weak and undertheorized (McGrew, 2016), Rios' (2011)
framework is empirically sound, providing strong evidence that
hypercriminalization occurs at the hands of the youth control complex.
However, I argue that the phenomenon is more complex than
criminalization and control and that social death accounts for this
complexity. Cacho (2012) argues that [criminalization is **one aspect**
of social death, but of equal importance is how]{.underline} [certain
groups of people are categorized as "**illegible for personhood**" and
unworthy of empathy or compassion]{.underline} (Cacho, 2012, p. 6).
[This **dehumanization** positions some youth as appearing human but
"really **subhuman** on the 'inside']{.underline}" (Merlo & Benekos,
2017, p. 27 citing Smith, 2016; see also Haslam & Loughnan, 2014). [The
**intertwining** of criminalization and dehumanization is not the only
advantage to using social death]{.underline}. In terms of metaphor, [the
metaphor of death rather than of control, more explicitly signifies that
forces of oppression actively inflict violences on oppressed
populations.]{.underline} The other reason for using social death has to
with the larger study that these case studies are drawn from. Data from
the larger study were used to develop an ecological understanding of
some of the violences that were inflicted on participants. There are
four faces of death that emerged from that larger project. As mentioned
above, my approach to social death is adapted from Cacho's (2012) work
to conceptualize the violences of criminalization and dehumanization
participants experienced as adolescents and young adults. The other
three faces of death that I employ are historical, psychological, and
biological. I use historical death to capture the violence of erasing
and/or rewriting participants' cultural history in and out of schools.
Psychological death refers to the psychological consequences of
historical and social death, and biological death refers to physical
health consequences of historical, social, and psychological death.
Biological death includes actual loss of life, which unfortunately one
of the study participants succumbed to. Methods

#### 1.3.6 Rights Theory

Contention 6 is Rights Theory. A key SCOTUS doctrine to be aware of is
the "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine; receiving contracts or
government benefits cannot be contingent upon you giving up your rights.
Ironically, you do not have the right to give up your rights, as that
reconstructs your inalienable rights as privileges able to be bought and
sold on the market, making you less of a citizen. A good example of
unconstitutional conditions applied is indentured servitude and/or
coercive contracts after the Civil War and the 13^th^ amendment. Banning
slavery would be pointless if you could (re)enter slavery and abrogate
your constitutional right to not be a slave if your family was paid
enough money to sell you into slavery, which is why SCOTUS eventually
banned coercive post-Civil War labor contracts that reproduced slavery
under a different name (as it produced unconstitutional conditions).

#### Unconstitutional conditions normally prevent you from treating your rights as privileges, a tradable good exchangeable in a deal. Plea bargaining is the exception 

**Hessick 21** \[Carissa Byrne Hessick, Ransdell Distinguished Professor
of Law at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where she also
serves as the director of the Prosecutors and Politics Project, 2021,
"Punishment Without Trial: Why Plea Bargaining Is a Bad Deal," Abrams
Press, ISBN: 9781419750304\]/Kankee

[The **trial penalty** has been around for **decades**]{.underline}. The
federal agency responsible for the administration of the courts used to
keep track of it in federal cases. That's how we know, for example, that
even back in the 1970s the average defendant who insisted on a jury
trial received a sentence that was three times longer than those of the
defendants who pleaded guilty. How can judges justify this? If
governments tried to put people in jail because they exercised other
rights---like the right to free speech, the right to belong to a church,
or the right to vote---judges would quickly step in and stop it. [Yet
the **Supreme Court** has decided to allow the government to
**imprison**]{.underline} people longer based on the mere fact that they
insisted on their right to a trial. Some people say that the [trial
penalty **doesn't punish** people for **exercising** their right to a
trial]{.underline}; it just grants a benefit (a shorter sentence) to
those who are willing to plead guilty. Personally, I don't see how a
judge's explicit threat to put someone in jail for an extra decade can
be [recharacterized as a **benefit** to some other defendant who pleaded
guilty]{.underline}. But even if it were, that [shouldn't make a
**difference** as a **constitutional matter**]{.underline}. [The courts
don't usually let]{.underline} [government officials force you to
**waive** your constitutional **rights**]{.underline} even [if they give
you something in return]{.underline}. [If]{.underline}, for example,
[the federal government told you that you have to give up your **right
to vote**]{.underline} in order [to get social security
benefits]{.underline}, judges would say [that was an]{.underline}
["**unconstitutional condition**]{.underline}" [and tell the government
it couldn't do that.]{.underline} But judges haven't extended their
unconstitutional conditions cases to plea bargaining. Instead, they
[allow government officials to send people to jail for
longer]{.underline} [just for exercising the right to a jury
trial]{.underline}. It doesn't even matter that [officials are doing
this in the open]{.underline}---[**threatening people** with longer
sentences]{.underline} or more serious criminal charges unless they
agree to plead guilty. The Supreme Court and other judges have said this
is perfectly okay. How do judges defend their decision to allow the
trial penalty and all of the threats and extra punishment associated
with plea bargaining? Sometimes they muddy the water by talking about
how they shouldn't second-guess the power of prosecutors to make
charging and bargaining decisions. Or they explain that the judge who
was giving a longer sentence after a trial did so only because the
defendant didn't "accept responsibility" and therefore might pose a
greater risk of committing crimes in the future. But the real answer is
that [the Supreme Court concluded that plea bargaining was necessary,
and then it had to **ignore** its ordinary constitutional law rules in
order to preserve the practice]{.underline}. [The Supreme Court admitted
as much in]{.underline} a [1978]{.underline} case, **[Bordenkircher v.
Hayes]{.underline}**. The opinion in Bordenkircher was written not too
long after the Supreme Court decided that it had to allow plea
bargaining because the courts couldn't accommodate bringing every
criminal case to trial. The prosecutor in the Bordenkircher case wanted
Paul Lewis Hayes to plead guilty to forgery in return for a sentencing
recommendation of five years in prison. The prosecutor told Hayes that
if he did not plead guilty, then he would bring new charges against him
under the state's habitual offender statute, which carried a mandatory
life sentence for anyone convicted of three felonies. (Hayes had two
previous convictions.) Hayes refused the plea bargain and was convicted
and sentenced to life in prison. Hayes appealed, relying on Supreme
Court cases that said punishing a person for exercising his
constitutional rights is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court reaffirmed
that it is "patently unconstitutional" for a government official to
penalize people for exercising their "legal rights." But then the
Supreme Court said that plea bargaining does not punish people for
exercising their right to a jury trial, but it is instead a
"give-and-take negotiation" that occurs "between the prosecution and
defense, which arguably possess relatively equal bargaining power." I
don't know how the Supreme Court could say that Paul Hayes and the
prosecutor have "equal bargaining power." All Hayes had was the right to
require the prosecutor to prove his case to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt ---something that was probably inconvenient but otherwise didn't
really affect the prosecutor. The prosecutor, on the other hand, had
Hayes's freedom for the rest of his life as leverage. Perhaps because
the bargaining power between Hayes and the prosecutor was so obviously
unequal, the Supreme Court admitted that it had to allow Hayes to be
threatened with life in prison because otherwise it would have to
declare plea bargaining unconstitutional. And when I say the Supreme
Court "admitted" this, I mean that literally. The Court said "by
tolerating and encouraging the negotiation of pleas, this Court has
necessarily accepted as constitutionally legitimate the simple reality
that the prosecutor's interest at the bargaining table is to persuade
the defendant to forgo his right to plead not guilty." It also said
"acceptance of the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily
implies rejection of any notion that a guilty plea is involuntary in a
constitutional sense . . ." In other words, the Court said that,
[because it had already accepted the constitutionality plea bargaining,
it also had to allow government officials to pressure defendants **to
plead guilty**]{.underline} and to impose longer punishments on them if
they insist on a trial. \* \* \* \* \* The idea that [plea bargaining
is]{.underline} just [a]{.underline} "negotiation" and not [punishment
for exercising constitutional rights]{.underline} isn't just something
the Supreme Court says. A number of very smart people have said
something similar when they have attempted to defend the institution of
plea bargaining. Those [attempts to justify plea bargaining describe a
plea bargain as a **contract**]{.underline} [between the prosecution and
the defendant]{.underline}. As one well-known defense puts it: "The
defendant [will trade the right to plead not guilty]{.underline} and
force [a trial for the prosecutor's right to seek the maximum
sentence]{.underline}." In these contract-based descriptions of plea
bargaining, defendants have some leverage: the ability to force a
prosecutor to spend the time and effort to take the case to trial.
Because prosecutors have lots of cases, the assumption is that they do
not have the ability to try more than just a few cases, and so any
threat by a defendant to take a case to trial has to be taken seriously.
Contract-based descriptions of plea bargaining also assume that the
bargains reflect the strength of the evidence against the defendant.
Just as we expect people to negotiate prices in other contracts to
reflect what they get in return, a criminal defendant should be able to
demand a shorter sentence in return for giving up a higher likelihood of
acquittal at trial. In contrast, a defendant who is more likely to get
convicted should get less of a sentence reduction in his plea bargain.
People who defend plea bargains speak about these different plea
bargains as "different prices." Defenders of plea bargains are quick to
discount many of plea bargaining's problems. Any problems with innocent
people who plead guilty as part of a plea bargain are recast as problems
with trials, not plea bargains; after all, it is the risk that innocent
defendants will lose and be convicted at trial that causes them to plead
guilty. Similarly, plea bargaining's defenders dismiss arguments about
how the trial penalty and harsh sentences create too much pressure on
defendants to plead guilty as criticisms of sentencing laws rather than
plea bargaining.

The 13th amendment is a more clear-cut, yes/no slavery example that
clearly qualified as producing unconstitutional conditions. However,
some contracts apply less totalizing restrictions on your rights by
comparison, which in combination with that contract being freely chosen
and non-coerced, allows some minor unconstitutional conditions. For
instance, non-disclosure agreements' restrictions on free speech
potentially violate the First Amendment if worded badly, which explains
courts striking down overly broad and restrictive non-disclosure
agreements that whose restrictions on the First Amendment harm free
speech rights. Non-disclosure agreements are only a partial restriction
on your free speech rights and the contract was (hopefully)
non-coercive, meeting it didn't produce an unconstitutional condition.

Thinking of the conditions for fair contract law is valuable. There's an
idea in neoliberal economics of contracts to be made in the free-market,
in which everyone has sufficient information and decision-making
capacity for all contracts to be freely consented to with everyone's
voluntary and free choice. However, that doesn't apply to the real
world, resulting in the judicial system determining that some contracts
are overly coercive and thereby void or substantially alter those
contracts.

Often there is a power imbalance, such as you being exceptionally poor
or your interlocuter being extremely rich, meaning that in both
circumstances you are not in a good position to bargain. As an enjoyer
of Monopoly, the deal-making in the game is a paradigmatic example of
"offers you can't refuse." You consented to the contract, but that
contract was made under the duress of losing the game, which implies
coercion, making that consent not freely given. Similarly, in the case
of a monopoly, the supplier has exclusive power over that good,
undermining the freedom of the market and resulting in potentially
coercive deals (as the supplier is a price-maker due to the lack of
rival suppliers to challenge his price). Both power imbalances and
monopolies are examples of seemingly freely consented to contracts, but
the conditions of that contract cause unfair bargaining that makes that
contract coercive.

Plea bargaining is both coercive (due to the power imbalance compared to
the prosecutor and his monopoly on sentencing), and it's a
totalizing/absolute restriction on your exercise of your 6^th^-8^th^
amendment rights related to jury trials and due process, which normally
would qualify as an unconstitutional condition. However, as described in
cards by Robert Schehr, SCOTUS interpretations of rights theory and
contract theory had a huge change in the 1930s-1970s, allowing the
commodification of your rights if the court felt you consented to it
(while simultaneously increasing standards for duress that would
implicate your otherwise free consent). This set the precedent for
vaguely constitutional contracts that potentially qualify as
unconstitutional conditions, such as non-compete agreements, mandatory
arbitration, and non-compete contracts. Of the most coercive and most
unconstitutional would-be plea bargaining given the immense difficulties
of freely negotiating with under threat of a higher penalty at trial,
the penalty being state violence via imprisonment and/or the death
penalty.

#### 1.3.7 Coercion 

Contention 7 is Coercion. As described many times in the topic analysis,
threatening to punish you with years in prison or perhaps death if you
exercise your constitutional rights harms the freedom of that contract.
It is as equally unfree and as much as a non-choice as a mafia boss
saying "pay the protection money or I break your legs." To repeat this
point more so would be a waste of everyone's time.

Note that this contention pairs well with rights theory, Kant, carceral
capitalism, and/or the innocence contentions.

#### 1.3.8 Carceral Capitalism

Contention 8 is Carceral Capitalism. This contention is a capitalism
centric version of the mass incarceration contention, focusing on the
potential commodification of rights and the system-level incentives of
mass incarceration for capitalists. Not only is mass incarceration
intrinsically useful for those benefiting from the construction and
maintenance of prisons for private prison companies, construction
companies, rural communities, guard unions, etc., its follow-on effects
allow for the construction of carceral citizenship (a more easily
exploitable underclass) and a means of a controlling surplus labor. A
key benefit of this contention is it's a great response to abolition
and/or antiblackness kritikal affs, saying that the capitalistic
desirability of the commodification of peoples and their suffering is
the prerequisite to broader prison abolition or race reform efforts.

This contention contains several high quality cards in regards to the
commodification of rights in plea bargaining that are useful for rights
centric affs. The justice system not only seeks to quantify the
unquantifiable with debts owed if someone caused another suffering, but
does a second-order commodification by quantifying the questionably
quantifiable debts owed in terms of their social utility (i.e.
deterrence, rehabilitation, restorative justice, etc.) and the
likelihood of the trial conviction being successful. This stupidly
abstract process I have likely confused you via the description therein
is an example of commodity fetishism, where we socially construct a debt
owed, and price in that debt compared to other social goods and the
likelihood of conviction so that the sentence can be bargained on the
prosecutorial marketplace. Commodification explains why justice feels
hollow, as there's an initial number (an quantity ill-defined in
relation to suffering caused) and a secondary adjustment of that number
based on similarly ill-defined, unquantifiable social goods and risks of
convictions. Both levels of commodification and abstraction make the
number feel unreal and unreasonable, driving our desire to punish
wrongdoers more in hope of making the number feel realistic, causing a
vicious cycle of commodification.

#### 1.3.9 Youth Plea Bargaining

Contention 9 is Youth Plea Bargaining. In terms of anti-plea bargaining
advocates, some of the greatest focus on abolition is on juvenile
justice systems due to the more easily moldable adolescent brains
(allowing easier rehabilitation), desire for leniency (due to lacking
full cognitive development assumed for everyone in the age of majority),
and their unique potential for coercion in legal situations (due to low
knowledge and again, less developed brains). Some juvenile courts have
completely banned plea bargaining to great success, more so then
generalized plea bargain bans that are a rarity (main examples include
1970s/2013 Alaska, El Paso, and New Orleans). Similarly, more of the
legal community agrees that juvenile plea bargaining is a bad practice,
and there's greater flexibility for non-punitive responses in juvenile
court compared to adult courts (i.e. theft is a specific crime with
certain years of punishment, but that punishment can be modified more
easily in juvenile courts).

Additionally, the process of discovery and questioning in juvenile
trials unveils info about a juvenile that aids in non-imprisonment
government rehabilitation programs. An easy example is a child neglect
case; if a child steals food because their parents aren't taking care of
them, bargaining over sentencing numbers and punishment over a few
minutes is not conducive to the court learning about the child's parents
need to see Child Protective Services. Often plea bargaining papers over
and minimize the uniqueness of an individual, and the "bargain" part of
plea bargaining implies less work for the prosecutor, allowing them to
focus on the crime potentially committed as opposed to who the child is
(harming post-conviction rehabilitation due to low, case-specific info
that could allow a tailored response). Other arguments include that an
overly punitive response can create youth criminals out of ordinary
juveniles who are treated very badly, somewhat similar to the idea that
a prison sentence ends up turning out like a job fair to meet other
criminals and make connections for future crime (as opposed to being
rehabilitated to prevent crime).

#### 1.3.10 Answers to Court Clog

Contention 14 is Answers to Court Clog. Court clog will be an argument
to appear in *almost every debate*, so you ought to be prepared to
answer it either via a defense of pure plea bargain abolition (per these
answers) or a counterplan that both bans plea bargaining AND solves
court clog via other means (see the "advantage counterplan" contention
above).

A useful analogy to think of when thinking of plea bargaining is latent
demand in for-profit healthcare systems in terms of concerns on
healthcare rationing. In debates about universal healthcare, opponents
argue, somewhat similar to those worrying about court clog, that the
system cannot handle everyone who desires healthcare having access to
healthcare, meaning we will be forced to ration resources. Full
healthcare access is analogous to trials by jury; both are the gold star
standard that everyone ought to have access to. Worries about court clog
or healthcare rationing under universal healthcare tacitly admit there
is latent demand, a pent-up and unmet need that cannot met without
additional resources.

If you say that if everyone accessed the good via the induced demand
(universal healthcare or plea bargain abolition) there would be delays
and rationing, that ADMITS that these people weren't having their needs
be met beforehand, implying we are willing to exclude these people from
good public services so other people don't need to wait. If you're
confused by the analogy, imagine two equations representing the
distribution of rights like trials:

1.  X = Fast System/"Good" Results (no court clog, aff/status quo)

2.  X + Y = Slow System/"Bad" Results (yes court clog, neg/no plea
    bargaining)

X is a group that does have access in the status quo, and Y is a group
that normally does not have access in equation 1 (but would have access
in equation 2 that assumes plea bargaining abolition). This equation
implies Y *never* had access to their rights and were excluded from the
good system so that X could benefit from lower waiting times. Even if
equation 1 looks good because court clog doesn't exist, Y is NOT
included, meaning that equation 1 by definition is a two-tiered system
of haves and have-nots. The aff being concerned about added wait times
is not an argument when the alternative is injustice for the everyone
else (Y) who was excluded from the justice process in order to clear the
line for those who do receive justice (X).

#### 1.3.11 White Collar Crime and Pedophiles

Contention 11 is White Collar Crime and Pedophiles. Plea bargaining is
often exploited via elites with extreme power to combat lawsuits due to
their wealth. The favorability of a plea bargain depends on both the
probability someone did a crime (and how severe it was), and how
difficult prosecution will be. An issue is when one's wealth can
substantially increase the difficulty of prosecution via a private army
of lawyers or a politically charged trial. The "lawyer army" phenomenon
is somewhat commonly exploited by elites, such a Strategic Lawsuit
Against Public Participation (SLAPP) to increase legal fees so
exorbitantly that it's easier for non-elites to cave to the lawsuit then
criticize a public figure who threatens to sue you. Similarly, it's a
common strategy for companies to exploit financial inequality to
increase legal inequality, such as frivolously suing low-income or small
businesses to secure intellectual property.

If a bargain is supposed to minimize work for the prosecutor and the
defendant is wealthy enough to stack the deck via stupidly long trials
and appeals with their "lawyer army," then all parties know that the
prosecutor is at a disadvantage, especially if a case could harm the
office politically. In the late-2000s Jeffery Epstein received a plea
bargain, one of such immense caliber that it granted \~100
co-conspirators to child rape immune to prosecution, likely due to
potential backlash from political elites or the ultra-wealthy that could
threaten the prosecutor's job security. That means that Epstein, despite
being a proven child sex trafficker, was wealthy enough and had powerful
enough connections to minimize virtually all legal harms to him until
\~2019 for a different, but related sex crime.

Of course this is not fair. In the sense that we note in every Kankee
Brief that "money should never be the reason why someone's debate career
is not successful," I think a similar argument money should be made that
"money should never be the reason why a sex trafficker or white collar
criminal isn't put behind bars." It implies a two-tiered justice system
and makes a mockery of fairness under the law when the law's potency for
punishment is threatened by a lawyer army creating too much work for a
trial to be worth it for a prosecutor.

#### 1.3.12 Innocents

Contention 12 is Innocents. Plea bargains are a potential means of which
innocent people can rationally admit guilt to crimes they did not
commit. Innocent/false conviction type impacts are sprinkled throughout
neg contentions (don't think the cards in this contention are the only
innocent convictions impacts), and wrongful conviction one of the most
common arguments on the topic outside of coercion.

As an aside, technically the legal language when we say "innocent" is
supposed to be "not guilty," as in not guilty for the charges filed.
Innocent is a broader, more inclusive term that says we have committed
no crimes, including, but not limited to the charges filed. In a court
case, you can be "not guilty" of the crime you've been charged for, but
still not be innocent given that you may have committed a crime that the
state has not yet charged. Obviously, innocence is a stronger claim that
people use to avoid this linguistic confusion and so that defendant
sounds better then they may actually be, which is why this is the
language used in most evidence, but technically the terminology is "not
guilty."

Based on statistics from The Innocence Project (and other ex post facto
exoneration organizations that do DNA testing of old crimes in order to
release the falsely convicted), a substantial percentage of false
convictions are the result of false guilty pleas out of threat of
greater punishment at trials. Per the relative severity and probability
of punishment with plea bargains and trials, some authors have argued
it's a rational decision to lie and plead guilty *even if you're
innocent*. The trial penalty is so large, and even if procedural
protections at trial are strong, there's still a non-negligible risk of
a false conviction. See earlier sections in the main topic analysis if
you need a better understanding of the trial penalty and potential
coercion from the prosecutor that results in innocent convictions.

#### Rational choice proves pleading guilty is rational to avoid the trial penalty

**Gilchrist 11** \[Gregory M. Gilchrist, Assistant Professor of Law at
the University of Toledo College of Law with an A.B. from Stanford and a
J.D. from Columbia, 2011, "Plea Bargains, Convictions And Legitimacy,"

https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/amcrimlr48&i=145\]/Kankee

This problem is best illustrated without accounting for the very real
complexi- ties introduced by cognitive bias and lack of information.
Such complexities are the basis for Bibas\' assertion that plea
bargaining does not really happen \"in the shadow of trial.\"5 7 A
simplified example-presented very much in the shadow of
trial-demonstrates that even a purely rational innocent defendant may
elect to plead guilty, and that the effective standard of proof for
securing this plea will be mere probable cause. Introducing real-world
biases (such as over-discounting future utility) and real-world
limitations (such as lack of information or resources) would
significantly complicate the example. As a result of such complexities,
some defendants would be more likely than the rational defendant to
accept a deal; others would be less likely to do so. 58 The point
remains, however, that plea bargaining asks defendants to decide whether
to plead guilty based on factors largely unrelated to actual guilt.59
Consider a hypothetical in which the quantum of evidence against the
defendant is such that [the innocent defendant assesses the risk of
conviction as **twenty** **percent**]{.underline}.60 [The defendant
faces **thirty years** in prison if convicted after trial and has an
offer of **four years** if she pleads guilty]{.underline}. [Discounting
the thirty-year sentence by the anticipated eighty-percent chance that
it would not result if the defendant opted for trial (30\*0.2) nets a
pre-trial estimate of the value of trial to be a **six-year**
sentence]{.underline}. 61 Even assuming-in another simplification
62-that the defendant val- ues her liberty consistently over time (i.e.,
without a value-reduction for liberty benefits accruing further in the
future), [a rational defendant would accept this offer without regard
for her guilt or innocence]{.underline}. [Anytime the calculus generates
a result where a rational defendant will plead guilty, the effective
burden of proof to achieve that result is probable cause (assuming the
defendant is rational]{.underline}). To be clear, this is not an
abstract concern. A four-year offer on charges that could net thirty
years after trial may seem unrealistic. It is not. Such a skew is
dramatic, but in federal criminal practice it is neither unusual nor
new. 63 For example, in a case involving illegal possession of a firearm
and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, a
federal prosecutor might offer a plea to the status offense of being a
felon-in-possession of a firearm,64 while threatening to charge carrying
a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime65 if the defendant
seeks a trial. 66 The felon-in-possession charge carries a statutory
maximum penalty of ten years. A defendant with two prior state felony
drug convictions, for which he served little time, will nonetheless be a
Career Offender under the Sentencing Guidelines,6 7 Career Offender
enhancements would apply to the more serious charge of carrying a
firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 6 8 but they do not
apply to the charge on which a plea is offered. Assuming that the prior
convictions each resulted in sentences of less than a year and a month,
but more than sixty days, and assuming that the defendant was released
from prison within the last two years, but is no longer on probation,
the defendant would earn six criminal history points and have a criminal
history category of III. The 922(g) conviction by plea would net
twenty-one offense levels. 69 That results in a guideline range of
forty-six to fifty-seven months. On the other hand, that same defendant,
as a Career Offender, if convicted of the more serious 924(c) charge
after trial, would face a guideline range of 360 months to life.70 With
offers like this, it quickly becomes clear how a person who believes
herself to be innocent could nonetheless consider pleading guilty. The
problem is compounded when the barriers to purely rational decision-
making are acknowledged. \"\[B\]ehavioral law and economics literature
has under- mined \[the assumption that actors are perfectly rational\],
exposing consistent irrationalities and imperfect heuristics in human
decisionmaking.\" 7 1 The foregoing illustration assumes a rational and
fully informed decision-maker with unlimited resources and, yet, still
manages to demonstrate circumstances in which an innocent person might
plead guilty. Accounting for the defendant\'s \"consistent
irrationalities and imperfect heuristics,\" the disconnect between
actual guilt and a willingness to plead guilty may be even more
severe.72

A useful framework for understanding the criminal justice system is
[type I and type II
errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors). Our
methodology for prosecuting suspects is either biased towards false
positives/type I errors in which innocents are wrongfully convicted or
false negatives/false negatives in which wrongdoers are wrongfully
acquitted. Given the lower standard of proof in plea bargains, needing
only probable cause for an arrest and the "consent" of a suspect,
wrongful convictions of innocents are more likely. Similarly, the higher
standards of proof and rules of evidence in trial are more likely to
result in criminals getting off due to the inability for the prosecutor
to prove the suspect committed a crime. Generally speaking, lower
standards of proof cause false positives/type I errors and higher
standards of proof cause false negatives/false negatives. To the degree
of which we lower our standards of proof to convict more criminals, the
greater our likelihood of convicting innocents, and vice versa.

When running this contention, it's paramount to say that the absolute
wrongness of a wrongful acquittal is not the same as a wrongful
conviction; a wrongful conviction is worse than a wrongful acquittal as
the needless punishment of people who did nothing wrong is worse than a
criminal not being punished. False positives should be framed as worse
than false negatives. Our security as citizens and the social contract
is based on the idea that the sovereign power of the state is just and
fair, so the punishment of innocents is a greater threat to the
legitimacy of the government then the non-punishment of criminals as all
non-criminals will fear they too risk a similar fate, blurring the line
between guilty criminals and innocent citizens and the presumption of
innocence. This explains the
[doctrine](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/it-better-ten-guilty-persons-go-free-one-innocent-person-be)
that "the law holds that it is better that 10 guilty persons escape,
than that 1 innocent suffer." Rights frameworks ought to argue that
deterring crime and rehabilitating criminal are secondary, utilitarian
goals of the justice system; fundamentally the justice system is
premised on justice, and that due process and the acquittal of innocents
comes before other incidental goals.

#### 1.3.13 Silence is Compliance

Contention 13 is Silence is Compliance. First amendment speech rights
are constitutionally enshrined, and to a certain extent do apply to the
criminal justice system. The right to testify, the right to represent
yourself, and the right to control what you do and do not say (the right
against self-incrimination) under the Constitution indicate the
importance of speech in court room settings. Even if acting upon that
speech via your own personal testimony and participation in a trial
process can be harmful to your case (hence the right against
self-incrimination), your active involvement via speaking, arguing, and
having an understanding of the process is intrinsically good. It is a
forum for the justice system to learn things regarding how effective and
fair the process is. Trials additionally have a means for the broader
public via the juror panel or the public to have testimony from
potential criminals about the harms to minority folk or innocents as a
result of the criminal justice system.

In contrast, where \~90-95% of cases are dealt with via guilty plea,
there is minimal ability for anyone to speak out or participate in the
judicial process, potentially leading to complacency on behalf of
defendants and minimal accountability for the justice system when no one
speaks out. Minimal defendant participation also implies a one-sided,
prosecutorial/judge centric narrative in court documents, and defendants
cannot use their narratives to counteract broader societal fears of
black criminality and fear-mongering on talk radio/TV.

Additionally, there are first amendment concerns in regards to compelled
speech. The justice system subdivides guilty pleas into open pleas, plea
bargains, [Alford pleas](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/alford_plea),
and [nolo contendere
pleas](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/nolo_contendere). The intricate
legalistic details of these for our purposes are of little concern; all
that needs to be known is there is a difference between pleading guilty
while admitting guilt (as seen in most plea bargains) and pleading
guilty to accept punishment while contesting or rejecting the assumption
of your guilt. A normal plea bargain has the prosecutor compelling you
to admit your guilt as part of your guilty plea. Even if the plea deal
is designed for efficiency in which its potentially vague and unclear
whether you're guilty, which implies the court hasn't met its burden of
proof to prove you truly were guilty, the admitting guilt part of the
plea deal ignores the efficiency concerns and mandates a guilty plea is
part and parcel with an admission of guilt.

If you were allowed Alford pleas and/or nolo contendere pleas, you
wouldn't be lying and there would be minimal concerns about compelled
speech, because both of these plea types don't require you to admit to
something into public record you disbelieve to be true. Legally, Alford
pleas and nolo contendere pleas are public records that say "yes, we're
skipping the trial to save everyone's time/money, but I think I am still
innocent." However, as well as that sounds for your and your non-lying
self, that statement is simultaneously harmful to the prosecutor,
because it is a public recognition that pleas do not equal trials (often
referred to as the "shadow of the trial") and looks bad on his public
image. If all plea bargains resulted in Alford pleas and nolo contendere
pleas, no one would be lying or compelled to speak something they
believe to be untrue, but because prosectors prevent defendants from
utilizing Alford pleas and nolo contendere pleas as part of their plea
deal, many people who plea guilty are coerced into lying. Fundamentally,
a more accurate and honest statement for someone to make when they want
to skip the trial is a nolo contendere plea, because its meaning implies
"no contest," not "I say I am actually guilty even though I might not
be" like in regular plea bargains.

Note that to the degree you prove that plea bargaining is lying, you win
a link to the compelled speech arguments. If plea bargaining is not
lying, it qualifies less so as compelled speech, meaning you should
focus on general free speech concerns in the silencing cards.

### Contention 1: Trials Bad (Pathologized Subject)

#### The trial system's reliance on forensic psychiatry constructs deviancy, reforming justifications for punishment for the "abnormal, disabled" other from utilitarian crime prevention to "objective" psychiatric assessments, excluding the prospect of deviancy and crime derived from normalcy, not disability and "madness."

**Foucault 79** \[Michel Foucault, qualifications not needed, 1979,

\*NOTE: OCR errors exist

Is this any more than a mere theoretical assertion, contradicted by
penal practice? Such a conclusion would be over-hasty. It is true that,
today, to punish is not simply a matter of converting a soul; but
Mably\'s principle has not remained a pious wish. Its effects can be
felt throughout modern penality. To begin with, there is a substitution
of objects. By this I do not mean that one has suddenly set about
punishing other crimes. No doubt the definition of offences, the
hierarchy of their seriousness, the margins of indulgence, what was
tolerated in fact and what was legally permitted - all this has
considerably changed over the last 200 years; many crimes have ceased to
be so because they were bound up with a certain exercise of religious
authority or a par ticular type of economic activity; blasphemy has lost
its status as a crime; smuggling and domestic larceny some of their
seriousness. But these displacements are perhaps not the most important
fact: the division between the permitted and the forbidden has preserved
a certain constancy from one century to another. On the other hand,
\'crime\', the object with which penal practice is concerned, has
profoundly altered: the quality, the nature, in a sense the substance of
which the punishable element is made, rather than its formal definition.
Undercover of the relative stability of the law, a mass of subtle and
rapid changes has occurred. Certainly the \'crimes\' and \'offences\' on
which judgement is passed are juridical objects defined by the code, but
[[judgement]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} also passed on the
passions, instincts, anomalies, infirmities, maladjustments, effects of
environment or heredity; acts of aggression are punished, so also,
through them, is aggressivity; rape, but at the same time perversions;
murders, but also drives and desires. But, it will be objected,
judgement is not actually being passed on them; if they are referred to
at all it is to explain the actions in question, and to determine to
what extent the the subject\'s will was involved in the crime. This is
no answer. For it is these shadows lurking behind the case itself that
are judged and punished. They are judged indirectly as \'attenuating
circumstances\' that introduce into the verdict not only
\'circumstantial\' evidence, but .something quite different, which is
not juridically codifiable: the knowledge of the criminal, one\'s
estimation of him, what is known about the relations between him, his
past and his crime, and what might be expected of him in the future.
They are also judged by the interplay .of all those notions that have
circulated between medicine and jurisprudence since the nineteenth
century (the \'mon sters\' of Georget\'s times, Chaumie\'s \'psychical
anomalies\', the \'perverts\' and \'maladjusted\' of our own experts)
and which, behind the pretext of explaining an action, are ways of
defining an indivi dual. They are punished by means of a punishment that
has the function of making the offender \'not only desirous, but also
capable, of living within the law and of providing for his own needs\';
they are punished by the internal economy of a penalty which, while
intended to punish the crime, may be altered (shortened or, in certain
cases, extended) according to changes in the prisoner\'s behaviour; and
they are punished by the \'security measures\' that accompany the
penalty (prohibition of entering certain areas, pro bation, obligatory
medical treatment), and which are intended not to punish the offence,
but to supervise the individual, [[to neutralize his]{.mark} [dangerous
state of mind]{.mark}]{.underline}, to alter his criminal tendencies,
and to continue even when this change has been achieved. [The
criminal\'s [soul is]{.mark}]{.underline} not referred to in the trial
merely to explain his crime and as [[a factor in the juridical
apportioning of responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}; if it is brought
before the court, with such pomp and circumstance, such concern [to
understand and such \'scientific\' application, it is [because]{.mark}
[it]{.mark} too, as well as the crime itself, [is to be judged]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} to [share in]{.mark} the [punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Through]{.mark}out the penal ritual, from the preliminary
[investigation to]{.mark} [the sentence]{.mark} and the final effects of
the penalty]{.underline}, a domain has been penetrated by objects that
not only duplicate, but also dissociate the juridically defined and
coded objects. [[Psychiatric expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also in
a more general way criminal anthropology and the repetitive discourse of
criminology, find one of their precise functions here: by [solemnly
[inscribing offences]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the field of [objects
susceptible of scientific knowledge]{.mark}, they provide the mechanisms
of legal punishment with a justifiable hold not only on offences, but on
individuals; not only on what they do, but also on what they are, will
be, may be]{.underline}. [The additional factor of the offender\'s soul,
which the legal system has laid hold of, is]{.underline} only apparently
[explanatory]{.underline} and limitative, and is in fact expansionist.
During the 150 or 2.00 years that Europe has been setting up its new
[penal systems]{.underline}, the judges have gradually, by means of a
process that goes back very far indeed, taken to [judging something
other than crimes, namely, the \'soul\' of the criminal.]{.underline}
And, by that very fact, they have begun to do something other than pass
judgement. Or, to be more precise, within the very judicial modality of
judgement, other types of [assessment]{.underline} have [slipped
in,]{.underline} profoundly altering its rules of elaboration. Ever
since the Middle Ages slowly and painfully built up the great procedure
of investiga tion, to judge was to establish the truth of a crime, it
was [to deter mine its author]{.underline} and to apply a legal
punishment. Knowledge of the offence, knowledge of the offender,
knowledge of the law: these three conditions made it possible to ground
a judgement in truth. But now a quite different question of truth is
inscribed in the course of the penal judgement. The question is no
longer simply: \'Has the act been established and is it punishable?\'
But also: \'What is this act, what is this act of violence or this
murder? To what level or to what f ield of reality does it belong? [Is
it a phantasy, a psychotic reaction, a delusional episode, a perverse
action]{.underline}?\' [It is no longer simply: \'Who committed it?\'
But: \'How can we assign the causal process that produced it? Where did
it originate in the author himself]{.underline}? Instinct, unconscious,
environment, heredity?\' It is no longer simply: \'What law punishes
this offence?\' But: \'What would be the most appropriate measures to
take? How do we see the future development of the offender? What would
be the best way of rehabilitating him?\' A whole set of [assessing,
[diagnostic]{.mark}, prognostic, [normative judgements]{.mark}
concerning the criminal have become [lodged]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
frame work of penal [judgement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Another truth has
penetrated the truth that was required by the [[legal
machinery]{.underline}]{.mark}; a truth which, entangled with the first,
has [[turned the assertion of guilt into a]{.mark} strange
**[scientifico-juridical complex]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A significant
fact is the way in which the question of madness has evolved in penal
practice. According to the 1810 code, madness was dealt with only in
terms of article 64. Now this article states that there is neither crime
nor offence if the offender was of unsound mind at the time of the act.
The possibility of ascertaining madness was, therefore, a quite separate
matter from the definition of an act as a crime; the gravity of the act
was not altered by the fact that its author was insane, nor the
punishment reduced as a consequence; the crime itself disappeared. It
was im possible, therefore, to declare that someone was both guilty and
mad; once the diagnosis of madness had been accepted, it could not be
included in the judgement; it interrupted the procedure and loosened the
hold of the law on the author of the act. Not only the examination of
the criminal suspected of insanity, but the very effects of this
examination had to be external and anterior to the sentence. But, very
soon, the courts of the nineteenth century began to misunderstand the
meaning of article 64. Despite several decisions of the supreme court of
appeal confirming that insanity could not result either in a light
penalty, or even in an acquittal, but required that the case be
dismissed, the ordinary [courts]{.underline} continued to [bring the
question of insanity to bear on their verdicts]{.underline}. [They
accepted that one could be both guilty and mad]{.underline}; less guilty
the madder one was; guilty certainly, but [someone to be put
away]{.underline} and treated rather than punished; [not only a guilty
man, but also dangerous, since quite obviously sick]{.underline}, etc.
From the point of view of the penal code, the result was a mass of
juridical absurdities. But this was the starting point of an evolution
that jurisprudence and legislation itself was to precipitate in the
course of the next I 50 years: already the [reform]{.underline} of 18p.,
introducing attenuating circumstances, [made it possible to modify the
sentence according to the supposed degrees of an illness or]{.underline}
the forms of a [semi-insanity]{.underline}. And the practice of calling
on [[psychiatric expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is widespread in
the assize courts and sometimes extended to courts of summary
jurisdiction, [[means]{.mark} that [the sentence]{.mark}, even if it is
always formulated in terms of legal punish ment, [implies]{.mark}, more
or less obscurely, judgements of [normality]{.mark}]{.underline},
attributions of causality, assessments of possible changes, anticipa
tions as to the offender\'s future. It would be wrong to say that all
these operations give substance to a judgement from the outside; they
are directly integrated in the process of forming the sentence. Instead
of insanity eliminating the crime according to the original meaning of
article 64, [every crime and even every offence now carries within it,
as a legitimate suspicion, but also as a right that may be claimed, the
hypothesis of insanity, in any case of anomaly]{.underline}. And [[the
sentence that condemns]{.mark} or acquits is not simply a judgement of
guilt, a legal decision that lays down punishment; it [bears]{.mark}
within it [an assessment of normality]{.mark} and a technical
prescription for a possible normalization]{.underline}. Today the
judge-magistrate or juror-certainly does more than \'judge\'. And he is
not alone in judging. Throughout the penal procedure and the
implementation of the sentence there swarms a whole series of subsidiary
authorities. Small-scale legal systems and parallel judges have
multiplied around the principal judgement: psychiatric or psychological
experts, magistrates concerned with the implementation of sentences,
educationalists, members of the prison service, all fragment the legal
power to punish; it might be objected that none of them really shares
the right to judge; that some, after sentence is passed, have no other
right than to implement the punishment laid down by the court and, above
all, that others - the experts - intervene before the sentence not to
pass judgement, but to assist the judges in their decision. But as soon
as the penalties and the security measures defined by the court are not
absolutely deter mined, from the moment they may be modified along the
way, from the moment one leaves to others than the judges of the offence
the task of deciding whether the condemned man \'deserves\' to be placed
in semi-liberty or conditional liberty, whether they may bring his penal
tutelage to an end, one is handing over to them mechanisms of legal
punishment to be used at their discretion: subsidiary judges they may
be, but they are judges all the\' same. The whole
[machinery]{.underline} that has been developing for years around the
implementation of sentences, and their adjustment to individuals,
[creates a proliferation of the authorities of judicial decision-making
and extends its powers of decision well beyond the
sentence]{.underline}. The psychiatric experts, for their part, may well
refrain from judging. Let us examine the three questions to which, since
the 1958 ruling, they have to address themselves: Does the convicted
person repre sent a danger to society? Is he susceptible to penal
punishment? Is he curable or readjustable? These questions have nothing
to do with article 64, nor with the possible insanity of the convicted
person at the moment of the act. They do not concern \'responsibility\'.
They concern nothing but the administration of the penalty, its
necessity, its usefulness, its possible effectiveness; they make it
possible to show, in an almost transparent vocabulary, whether the
mental hos pital would be a more suitable place of confinement than the
prison, whother this confinement should be short or long, whether
medical treatment or security measures are called for. What, then, is
the role of the psychiatrist in penal matters? He is not an expert in
responsibility, but an adviser on punishment; it is up to him to say
whether the subject is \'dangerous\', in what way one should be
protected from him, how one should intervene to alter him, whether it
would be better to try to force him into submission or to treat him. At
the very beginning of its history, psychiatric expertise was called upon
to formulate \'true\' propositions as to the part that the liberty of
the offender had played in the act he had committed; it is now called
upon to suggest a prescription for what might be called his \'medico
judicial treatment\'. To sum up, ever since the new penal system- that
defined by the great codes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries-
has been in operation, a general process has led judges to judge
something other than crimes; they have been led in their sentences to do
some thing other than judge; [and the power of judging has been trans
ferred, in part, to other authorities than the judges of the offence.
The whole penal operation has taken on extra-juridical elements and
personnel]{.underline}. It will be said that there is nothing
extraordinary in this, that it is part of the destiny of the law to
absorb little by little elements that are alien to it. But what is odd
about modern criminal justice· is that, although it has taken on so many
extra-juridical elements, it has done so not in order to be able to
define them juridically and ,gradually to integrate them into the actual
power to punish: on the contrary, it has done so in order to make them
func tion within the penal operation as non-juridical elements; in order
to stop this operation being simply a legal [punishment; in order to
exculpate the judge from being purely and simply he who
punishes]{.underline}. \'Of course, we pass sentence, but this sentence
is not in direct ·relation to the crime. It is quite clear that for us
it functions as a way of treating a criminal. [We punish, but this is a
way of saying that we wish to obtain a cure]{.underline}.\' Today,
[criminal [justice]{.mark} functions and [justifies itself]{.mark} only
[by]{.mark} this perpetual [reference to]{.mark} something other than
itself, by this unceasing reinscription in [non-juridical
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its fate is to be redefined by knowledge.
Beneath the increasing leniency of punishment, then, one may map a
displacement of its point of application; and through this displacement,
a whole field of recent objects, a whole new system of truth and a mass
of roles hitherto unknown in the exercise of criminal justice. A corpus
of knowledge, techniques, \'scientific\' discourses is formed and
becomes entangled with the practice of the power to punish. This book is
intended as a correlative history of the modem soul and of a new power
to judge; a genealogy of [the]{.underline} present [scientifico legal
complex from which the power to punish derives its]{.underline} bases,
[justifications]{.underline} and rules, from which it extends its
effects and by which it masks its exorbitant singularity. But from what
point can such a history of the modern soul on trial be written? If one
confined oneself to the evolution of legislation or of penal procedures,
one would run the risk of allowing a change in the collective
sensibility, an increase in humanization or the development of the human
sciences to emerge as a massive, external, inert and primary fact. By
studying only the general social forms, as Durkheim did (cf.
Bibliography), one runs the risk of positing as the principle of greater
leniency in punishment pro cesses of individualization that are rather
one of the effects of the new tactics of power, among which are to be
included the new penal mechanisms. This study obeys four general
rules: 1. Do not concentrate the study of the punitive mechanisms on
their \'repressive\' effects alone, on their \'punishment\' aspects
alone, but situate them in a whole series of their possible positive
effects, even if these seem marginal at first sight. As a consequence,
regard punishment as a complex social function. 2 .. [Analyse punitive
methods not simply as consequences of legislation]{.underline} or as
indicators of social structures, [but as techniques]{.underline}
possessing their own specificity in the more general field of other ways
[of exercising power. Regard punishment as a political
tactic]{.underline}. 3· Instead of [treat]{.underline}ing the history of
[penal law and]{.underline} the history of the [human sciences
as]{.underline} two separate series whose overlapping appears to have
had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, [a]{.underline} disturbing
or useful effect, according to one\'s point of view, see whether there
is not some [common matrix]{.underline} or whether [they]{.underline} do
not [both derive from a single process of \'epistemologico-juridical\'
formation]{.underline}; in short, make the technology of power the very
principle both of the humanization of the penal system and of the
knowledge of man. 4i Try to discover whether this entry of the soul on
to the scene of penal justice, and [with]{.underline} it [the insertion
in legal practice of a whole corpus of \'scientific\' knowledge, is not
the effect of a transformation of the way in which the body itself is
invested by power relations]{.underline}. In short, try to study the
metamorphosis of punitive methods on the basis of a political technology
of the body in which might be read a common history of power relations
and object relations. Thus, by an analysis of penal leniency as a
technique of power, one might understand both how man, the soul,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} normal or [[abnormal individual]{.mark} have
come to [duplicate crime as objects of penal intervention]{.mark};
[and]{.mark} in what way a specific mode of subjection was able to give
birth to [man as an object of knowledge]{.mark} for a dis course with a
\'scientific\' status]{.underline}. But I am not claiming to be the
first to have worked in this direction.

#### Plea bargaining avoids the carceral state's disciplinarian deviancy construction -- decreased punishment severity, more secrecy, hope of leniency, and basing sentences on prosecutorial convenience, not the certain deservingness of punishment found at trials with evidence and discovery. Trials seek to individualize and psychoanalyze offenders to reconstruct their normalcy via punishment; they're not assembly line justice where confessions are under the threat of greater punishment like in plea bargaining

The rule of lateral efects. [[The penalty must have]{.mark} [its]{.mark}
**[most intense]{.mark}** [effects]{.mark} [on those who have not
committed the crime]{.mark}]{.underline}l to carry the argument to its
limit, if one could be sure that the criminal could not repeatthe crime,
it would be enough to make others believe that he had been punished.
There is a centrifugal intensification of effects, which leads to the
paradox that in the calculation of penalties the least important element
is still the criminal (unless he is likely to repeat the offence).
Beccariaillustrated this paradox in the punish- ment that he proposed to
replace the death sentence- perpetual slavery. Is this not a physically
more cruel punishment than deathl Not at all, he says: becausethe pain
of slavery, for the condemned man, is divided into as many portions as
he has moments left to live; it is an infinitely divisible penalty, an
Eleatic penalty, much less severe than capital punishment, which is only
one step away from the public execudon. On the other hand, [for those
who see these [slaves]{.mark}, or represent them to
themselves]{.underline}, [the [pains]{.mark} they bear]{.underline} are
concentrated into a single idea; all the moments of slavery
[[are]{.mark} [contracted into a representation]{.mark}]{.underline}
that then becomes [**[more terrifying]{.mark}**
[than]{.mark}]{.underline} the idea of [[death]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
is the economically ideal punishment: it is minimal for him who
undergoes it (and who, reduced to slavery, cannot repeat his crime) and
it is maximal for him who representsit to himself. \'Among the
penalties,and in the way of applying them in proportion to the offences,
[[one must choose the means that will leave]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
**[most]{.mark}** [**lasting** impression]{.mark} on the minds of the
people]{.underline}, and the least cruel on the body of the criminal\'
(Beccaria,87). [The rule of **perfect certainty**]{.underline}. With the
idea of each crime and the advantages to be expected of it must be
associated the idea of a particular punishment with the precise
inconveniences that result from it; [the link from one to the other must
be regarded as]{.underline} necessary and **[unbreakable]{.underline}**.
This general element of [certainty]{.underline} that [must give the
system of punishment its effectiveness]{.underline} involves a number of
precise measures. The laws that define the crime and lay down the
penalties must be perfectly clear, \'so that each member of society may
distinguish criminal actions from virtuous actions\' (Brissot, z4).
These laws must be published, so that everyone has accessto them; what
is neededis not oral traditionsand customs,but a written
legislationwhich can be \'the stablemonument of the social pact\',
printed texts availableto all: \'Only printing can make the public as a
whole and not just a few p!rsonsdepositoriesofthe sacredcodeof the
laws\' (Beccaria,z6). [[The monarch must]{.mark} [renounce]{.mark} [his
right of]{.mark} [pardon]{.mark} [so]{.mark} that the force that is
present in the idea of [punishment is not attenuated by the hope of
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}: [\'If one allows men to see that the
crime may be pardoned and that punishment is not a necessary consequence
of it, one nourishes in them the hope of going unpunished]{.underline}..
. [[The laws must be **inexorable**, those who execute them
**inflexible**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\'e Above all, no crime committed
must escape the gaze of those whose task it is to dispense justice.
Nothing so weakens the machinery of the law than the hope of going un-
punished;how could one establishin the minds of the public a strict link
between the offence and a penalty if it were aflected by a certain
coefficient of improbabilityi Would it not be necessaryto make the
penalty the more to be fearedin its violence as it is lessto be feared
in its uncertaintyi Rather than imitate the old system in this way and
be \'more severe,one must be more vigilanl\'.ro Hence the idea that the
machinery of justice must be duplicated by an organ of surveillancethat
would work side by side with it, and which would make it possible either
to prevent crimes, or, if committed, to arrest their authors; police and
justice must work together as two comple- mentary actions of the
sameprocess- the police assuring \'the action of society on each
individual\', justice \'the rights of individuals against society\'
(Duport, Archives parlementaires,XXI, 4y). Thus every crime will come to
the light of day and be punished in all certainty. But it is also
necessarythat the [[legal procedures **should not remain**
secret]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [[the reasons why a defendant is
condemned]{.mark} or acquitted [should be known to all]{.mark}, and each
individual must be able to recognize the reasons for a penalty: \'Let
the magistrate speak his opinion aloud, let him be obliged to read in
his judgement the text of the law that condemns the
defendant]{.underline}. . . Let the procedures that are buried
mysteriously in the obscurity of the records office be opened to all
citizens who are concerned at the fate of the con- demned\' (Mably,
3a8). The rule of common truth. Beneath this ordinary-seeming principle
is hidden an important transformation. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
[old]{.underline} system of [legal proofs]{.underline}, the use [of
torture]{.underline}, the [[extraction of
confessions]{.underline}]{.mark} ,the use of the public execution, the
body and spectacle for the reproduction of tmth [had]{.underline} long
[isolated penal practice from the common]{.underline} forms of
[demonstration]{.underline}: [semi-proofs [produced semi-truths and
semi-guilty persons]{.mark}]{.underline}, words extracted by pain had
greater authenticity, presump- tion involved a degree of punishment. The
heterogeneiry of this system with the ordinary system of proof really
constituted a scandal only when [[the power to punish]{.mark}
**[needed]{.mark}**, for its own economy, a climate of
**[irrefutable]{.mark} [certainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[How can one
link]{.mark} **[absolutely]{.mark}** in the minds of men [the idea of
crime and]{.mark} the idea of [punishment]{.mark}, [if]{.mark} [the
reality of the punishment does not follow]{.mark}, in all cases, the
reality of the offence.]{.underline} [To establish the
offence]{.underline}, in all [[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
accord- ing td the means valid for all, [[becomes]{.mark} a task [of
**first importance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The verification of the
crime must obey the general criteria for all truth]{.underline}. In the
arguments it employs, in the proofs it provides, legal judgrcment must
be homogeneous with judgement in general. [There is]{.underline},
therefore, an abandonment of legal proof, a rejection of torture, [the
need for a **complete demonstration** of the truth, an effacement of all
correlation between degrees of suspicion and degrees of
punishment]{.underline}. [Like a mathematical truth, the truth of the
crime will be accepted only when it is completely proven]{.underline}.
It follows that, [[up]{.underline} [to the final
demonstration]{.underline}]{.mark} [of his crime, [the defendant must be
regarded as innocent]{.mark}l]{.underline} and that, in order to carry
out this demonstra- tion, [the judge must use]{.underline} not ritual
forms, but [common]{.underline} instnrments, that [reason]{.underline}
possessedby everyone, which is also that of philoso- phers and
scientists:\'In theory, I regard the magistrateas a philoso- pher who
sets out to discover an interesting truth. . . His sagacity will enable
him to grasp all the circumstancesand all the relations, bring togethbr
or separatewhatever needs to be brought together or separatedin order to
arrive at a sane judgement\' (Seigneux de Corevon, a9). The
investigation, the exerciseof common reason, lays aside the old
inquisitorial model and adopts the much more subtle model (doubly
validated by [science]{.underline} [and]{.underline} common sense)of
[empirical research]{.underline}. The judge will be like a \'pilot
steering between the rocks\': \'What proofs or what clues will be
considered to be sufficient neither I nor anyone else has dared to
determine in general; since circumstancesare subject to infinite
variations, since proofs and elues must be deduced from these
circumstances,the cleares clues and proofs must necessarilyvary in
proportion\' (Risi, y3). Henceforth, [penal practice was to be subiect
to a common rule of truth]{.underline}, or rather to a complex rule in
which heterogeneous elements of scientific demonstration, the evidenceof
the sensesand common sensecome together [to form the]{.underline}
judge\'s \'deep\'seated [conviction\']{.underline}. Although penal
justice preservesthe forms that guaranteeits equity, it may now be
opened up to all manner of truths, providing they are evident, well
founded, acceptableto all. [[The legal ritual]{.mark} in itself [no
longer generates a divided truth]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is resituated
in the field of reference of common proofs. With the multiplicity of
scientific discourses,a difficult, infinite relation was then forged
that penal justice is still unable to control. The master of justice is
no longer the master of its truth. The rule of optimal specifcation.For
penal semiotics to cover the whole field of illegalities that one wishes
to eliminate, all offences must be defined; they must be classifiedand
collected into species from which none ofthem can escape.A code is
therefore necessary and this code must be sufficiently precisefor each
type of ofience to be clearly presentin it. The silenceof the law must
not harbour the hope of impunity. An exhaustive,explicit code is
required, defining crimes and fixing penalties. (On this theme, cf.,
among others, Linguet, 8.) But the same imperative need for a total
coincidence between all possible offences and the effects-signsof
punishment forces one to go further. The idea of the samepunishment does
not have the sameeffect on everyone: the rich do not fear fines nor the
notorious infamy. The injury causedby an offence and its value as
example differ according to the status of the offender; a crime
committed by a noble is more injurious to society than one com- mitted
by a man of the people (Lacretelle, r44). Lastly, [since punish- ment
must prevent a repetition of the offence, it must take into account the
profound nature of the criminal himself, the presumable degree of his
wickedness,the intrinsic quality of his will]{.underline}: \'Of two men
who have committed the sametheft, how much lessguilty is he who
scarcelyhad the necessitiesof life than he who overflowed with excesslOf
two perjurers, how much more criminal is he on whom one has striven from
his childhood to impress feelings of honour than he who, abandoned to
nature, never received the benefit of education\' (Marat, 34). [[One
sees the]{.underline}]{.mark} emergence at the same time of the need for
a parallel classificationof crimes and punishments, the [[need for an
individualization of sentences]{.mark}, [in accordance with]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} particular [characteristics of each
criminal]{.mark}]{.underline}. This individualization was to weigh very
heavily throughout the history of modern penal law; it is rooted
precisely here in terms of the theory of law and accord- ing to the
requirements of everyday practice, [it is]{.underline} no doubt
[[in]{.mark} radical [**opposition** to]{.mark} the principle of
[codification]{.mark}]{.underline}; but from the standpoint of the
economy of the power to punish, and of the techniques by which one
wishes to circulate throughout the social body precisely calibrated
signs of punishment, with neither excesses nor loopholes,with neither a
useless \'expenditure\' of power nor with timidity, it becomesevident
that the codification of the offences- punishments system and the
modulation of the criminal-punish- ment dyad go side by side, each
requiring the other. [Individualiza-tion appears as the ultimate
aim]{.underline} of a precisely adapted code. But this individualization
is very different in its nature from the modulations of punishment to be
found in the old jurisprudence, The old system - and on this point it
followed Christian peniten- tiary practice- used two seriesof
variablesto adjust the punishment, those of \'circumstances\'and those
of intention\'; elements,that is to say, that made it possible to
qualify the act itself. The modulation of the penalty belonged to
\'casuistry\' in the broad sense.(On the non-individualizing character
of casuistry, cf. Cariou.) But what w:rs now beginning to emergewas a
modulation that referred to the defendant himself, to his nature, to his
way of life and his attitude of mind, to his past,to the\'quality\'and
not to the intention of his will. One perceives,but as a place as yet
un6lled, the locus in which, in penal practice, [psychological knowledge
will take over the role of casuistic jurisprudence]{.underline}. Of
course, at the end of the eighteenth century, that moment was still far
off. The code-individualization link was sought in the scientific models
of the period. Natural history no doubt offered the most
adeguateschema:the taxonomy of speciesaccording to an uninterrupted
gradation. One sought to constitute a Linnaeus of crimes and
punishments, so that each particular offenceand eachpunishableindividual
might come, with- out the slightest risk of any arbitrary action, within
the provisions of a general law. \'A table must be drawn up of all the
genera of crimes to be observed in different countries. According to the
enumeration of crimes, a division into speciesmust be carried out. The
best rule of this division is, it seems to me, to separatethe crimes
according to their objects. This division must be such that each
speciesis quite distinct from another, and that each particular crime,
considered in all its relations may be placed between that which must
precedeit and that which must follow it, in the strictest gradation;
lastly, this table must be such that it may be compared with another
table that will be drawn up for penalties,in such a way that they may
correspond exactly to one another\' (Lacretelle, 3yr- 3yz). In theory,
or rather in dream, the double taxonomy of punishments and crimes will
solve the problem: but how is one to apply fixed laws to particular
individualsl Far removed from this speculativemodel, forms of
anthropologi- cal individualization were being constituted at the same
period in what was still a very rough and ready way. Let us take first
the notion of the repetition of crime. Not that this was unknown to the
old criminal laws.ll But it was tending to become a description of the
defendant himself capable of altering the sentencepassed: according to
the legislation of rygr, recidivists were liable in almost all casesto a
doubling of the penalty; according to the law of Flordal Year X, they
had to be branded with the letter R; and the penal code of t8ro
inflicted on them either the maximum possibleof the normal penalty, or
the penalty immediately above it. Now, through the repetition of the
crime, what one was aiming at was not the author of an act defined by
law, but the delinquent subject himseld a certain will that manifested
his intrinsically criminal character. Gradually, as criminality, rather
than crime, becamethe object of penal inter- vention, the opposition
between first offender and recidivist tended to become more important.
And on the basis of this opposition, reinforcing it on several points,
one seesat the same period the formation of the notion of the \'oime
passionel\' - an involuntary, unpremeditated crime, bound up with
extraordinary circumstances, which, while not offering the sameexcuseas
madness,nevertheless prevented it from being regarded as an ordinary
crime. As early as rygt, Le Peletier remarked that the subtle gradation
of penalties that he had presentedto the Constituent Assembly might
dissuade from crime\'the evil-doer who plansa wicked action in cold
blood\', and who may be iestrained by thoughts of the penalty; but, on
the other hand, it was powerlessagainstcrimes due to \'violent passions
that have no regard to consequences\';this, however, was unimport- ant,
sincesuch crimes revealedin their authors\'no reasonedwicked- ness.\'lI
Beneath the humanization of the penalties,what one finds are all those
rules that authorize, or rather demand, \'leniency\', as a calcu- lated
economy of the power to punish. But they also provoke a shift in the
point of application of this power: [it is no longer the
body]{.underline}, with the ritual play of excessivepains,
spectacularbrandings [in]{.underline} the ritual of the [public
executionl it is the mind]{.underline} or rather a play of
representationsand signs circulating discreetly but necessarily and
evidently in the minds of all. It is no longer the body, but the soul,
said Mably. And we see very clearly what he meant by this term: the
correlative of a technique of power. Old \'anatomies\' of punishment are
abandoned. But have we really entered the age of non-corporal
punishmentl At the point of departure, then, [one may place the
political project of rooting out illegalities]{.underline}, generalizing
the punitive function and delimiting, in order to control it, the power
to punish. From this there emerge two lines of obiectification of crime
and of the criminal. On the one hand, [[the criminal designated
as]{.mark}]{.underline} the enemy of all, whom it is in the interest of
all to track down, falls outside the pact, disqualifies himself as a
citizen and emerges, bearing within him as it were, a wild fragment of
nature; he appearsas a villain, a monster, [[a
madman]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps, [a sick]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, before long, **[\'abnormal\']{.underline}**
[individual]{.underline}. It is as such that, one day, [he [will belong
to a scientific objectification]{.mark} and to the \'treatment\' that is
correlative to it]{.underline}. On the other hand, the need to measure,
from within, the effects of the punitive pov/er prescribestactics of
intervention over all criminals, actual or potential: the organization
of a field of prevention, the calculation of interests,the circulation
of representationsand signs, the constitution of a horizon of certainty
and proof, the adjustment of penaltiesto ever more subde variables; all
this also leads to an obiectification of criminals and crimes. In either
case,one seesthat the power relation that underlies the exerciseof
punishment begins to be duplicated by an object relation in which are
caught up not ,only the crime as a fact to be established according to
common norms, but the criminal as an individual to be known according to
specific criteria. One also sees that this obiect relation is not
superimposed,from the outside, on the punitive practice, as would be a
prohibition laid on the fury of the public execution by the limits of
the sensibility, or as would be a rational or \'scienti6c\'
interrogationas to what this man that one is punishingreally is. The
processes of obiectification originate in the very tacticsofpower and of
the arrangement of its exercise. However, the two types of
objectification that emerge with the project ofpenal reform are very
different from one another: both in their chronology and in their
effects. The objectification of the criminal asoutsidethe law,
asnaturalman, is still only a potentiality, a vanishing trace, in which
are entangled the themes of political criticism and the figures of the
imagination. One will have to wait a long time beforc homo uiminalis
becomesa definite obiect in the field of knowledge. The other, on the
contrary, has had much more rapid and decisive effects in so far as it
was linked more directly to the reorganizationof the power to punish:
codificarion, definition of offences, the fixing of a scale of
penalties, rules of procedure, definition of the role of magistrates.And
also becauseit made use of the discoursealreadyconstituted by
theldiologues.This discourse provided, in effect, by meansofthe theory
ofinterests, representa- tions and signs, by the seriesand genesesthat
it reconstituted, a sort of general recipe for the exerciseof power over
men: [[the \'mind\' as a surface of inscription for power]{.mark}, with
semiology as its tool; [the submission of bodies through the control of
ideas; the analysis of]{.mark}]{.underline} representationsas a
principle in a [[politics of bodies]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} much [[more effective
than]{.mark}]{.underline} the ritual anatomy of [[torture]{.mark} and
execution]{.underline}. The thought of the ldtologuer was not only a
theory of the individual and society; it developed as a technology of
subtle, effective, economic powers, in opposition to the
sumptuousexpenditureof the power of the sovereign. Let us hear once more
what Servan has to say: the ideas of crime and punishment must be
strongly linked and \'follow one another without interruption. . . When
you have thus formed the chainof ideasin the headsof your citizens,you
will then be able to pride yourselves on guiding them and being their
masters.A stupid despotmay constrainhis slaveswith iron chains; but a
true politician binds them even more strongly by the chain of their own
ideas;it is at the stable point of reasonthat he securesthe end of the
chain; this link is all the stronger in that we do not know of what it
is made and we believe it to be our own work; despair and time eat away
the bonds of iron and steel, but they are power- lessagainst the
habirual union of ideas,they can only tighten it still more; and on the
soft fibres of the brain is founded the unshakable baseofthe
soundestofEmpires\'(Servanr sy). It is this semio-techniqueof
punishments, this \'ideological power\' which, partly at least, will
remain in suspenseand will be supersededby a new political anatomy, in
which the body, once again, but in a new form, will be the principal
character.And this new political anatomy will permit the intersection of
the two divergent lines of objectification that are to be seenemerging
in the eighteenth century: that which reiects the criminal \'from the
other side\'- from the side ofa nature againstnature; and that which
seeks to control delinquency by a calculatedeconomy of punishments.A
glance at the new art of punishing clearly reveals the supersession of
the punitive semio-techniqueby a new politics of the body 2. The

In short, its task was to constitute a prison-machinert with a cell of
visibility in which the inmate will find himself caught as \'in the
glass house of the Greek philosopher\' (Harou-Romain, 8) and a central
point from which a permanent gaze may control prisoners and staff.
Around these two requirements, several variations were possible the
Benthamite Panopticon in its strict form, the semi- circle, the
cross-plan, the star shape. In the midst of all these dis- cussions,the
Minister of the Interior in r84r sums up the funda- mental principles:
\'The central inspection hall is the pivot of the system. Without a
central point of inspection, surveillance ceases to be guaranteed,
continuous and general; for it is impossible to have complete trust in
the activity, zeal and intelligence of the warder who immediately
supervisesthe cells. . . The architect must therefore bring all his
attention to bear on this object; it is a question both of discipline
and economy. The more accurate and easy the surveillance,the lessneed
will there be to seekin the strength of the building guaranteesagainst
attempted escapeand communication beween the inmates.But
surveillancewill be perfect if from a central hall the director or
head-wardersees,without moving and without biing seen,not only the
entrancesofall the cellsand even the inside of most of them when the
unglazed door is open, but also the warders guarding the prisoners on
every floor. . . With the formula of circular or semi-circular prisons,
it vzould be possible to seefrom a single centre all the prisoners in
their cells.and the warders in the inspectiongalleries\'(Ducatel, 9).
But the penitentiaryPanopticonwas alsoa systemof individual- izing and
permanent documentation. The same year in which variants of the
Benthamite schema were recommended for the building of prisons, the
system of \'moral accounting\' was made compulsory:an individual report
of a uniform kind in every prison, on which the governor or head-warder,
the chaplain and the instructor had to fill in their observations on
each inmate: \'It is in a way the vademecumof prison
administration,making it possibleto assesseach case, each circumstance
and, consequently, to know what treatment to apply to eachprisoner
individually\' (Ducp6tiaux, y6-7). Many other, much more
complete,systemsof recording were planned or tried out (cf., for
example, Gregory, r99ff; Grellet- Wammy, z3-5 and ryg-zq). The overall
aim was to make the prison a place for the constitution of a body of
knowledge that would regulate the exerciseof penitentiary practice. The
prison has not only to know the decisionof the judgesand to apply it in
terms ofthe establishedregulations: it has to extract unceasingly from
the inmate a body of knowledge that will make it possible to transform
the penal measureinto a penitentiary operation; which will make of the
penalty required by the offencea modification of the inmate that will be
of use to society. The autonomy of the carceralrdgime and the knowledge
that it createsmake it possible to increasethe utility of the penalty,
which the code had made the very principle of its punitive philosophy:
\'The governor must not lose sight of a single inmate, becausein
whatever part of the prison the inmate is to be found, whether he is
entering or leaving, or whether he is staying there, the governor must
also justify the motives for his staying in a particular
classificationor for his movement from one to another. He is a veritable
accountant. Each inmate is for him, in the sphere of individual
education, a capital invested with penitentiary interest\' (Lucas, Tl,
449-1o). As a highly efficient technology, penitentiary
practiceproducesa return on the capital invested in the penal system and
in the building of heavy prisons. Similarly, the ofiender becomes an
individual to know. This demand for knowledge was not, in the first
instance, inserted into the legislation itself, in order to provide
substancefor the sentence and to determine the true degreeof guilt. It
is as a convict, as a point of application for punitive mechanisms,that
the offender is con- stituted himself as the object of possible
knowledge. But this implies that the penitentiary apparatus,with the
whole technological programme that accompanies it, brings about a
curious substitution: from the hands ofjustice, it certainly receives a
convicted person; but what it must apply itself to is not, of course,
the offence, nor even exactly the offender, but a rather different
object, one defined by variableswhich at the outset at leastwere not
taken into account in the sentence,for they were relevant only for a
corrective technology. This other character, whom the peniten- tiary
apparatus substitutes for the convicted offender, is the delinquent. The
delinquent is to be distinguished from the offender by the fact that it
is not so much his act as his life that is relevant in char- acterizing
him. The penitentiary operation, if it is to be a genuine
re-education,must becomethe sum total existenceof the delinquent, making
of the prison a sort of artificial and coercive theatre in which his
life will be examined from top to bottom. The legal punishment bears
upon an act; the punitive technique on a life; it falls to this punitive
technique, therefore, to reconstitute all the sordid detail of a life in
the form of knowledge, to fill in the gaps of that knowledge and to act
upon it by a practiceof compulsion.It is a biographical knowledge and a
technique for correcting individual lives. The observation of the
delinquent \'should go back not only to the circumstances,but also to
the causesof his crime; they must be sought in the story of his life,
from the triple point of view of psychology, social position and
upbringing, in order to discover the dangerousproclivities of the first,
the harmful predispositionsof the second and the bad antecedentsof the
third. This biographical investigation is an essentialpart of the
preliminary investigation for the classificationof penalities before it
becomesa condition for the classification of moralities in the
penitentiary system. It must accompany the convict from the court to the
prison, where the governor\'s task is not only to receiveit, but also to
complete, super- vise and rectify its various factors during the period
of detention\' (Lucas, IIr 44o-42). Behind the offender, to whom the
investigation of the facts may attribute responsibility for an offence,
stands the delinquent whose slow formation is shown in a biographical
investigation.The introduction of the [\'biographical\']{.underline} is
important in the history of penality. Becauseit [establishes the
\'criminal\' as existing before the crime and even outside
it]{.underline}. And, for this reason, [a psychological causality,
duplicating the juridical attribution of responsibility, confuses its
effects]{.underline}. At this point one enters the \'criminological\'
labyrinth from which we have certainly nor yer emerged: any determining
cause,because it reduces responsibility, marks the author of the ofience
with a criminality all the rnore for- midable and demands penitentiary
measures that are all the more strict. As the biography of the criminal
duplicates in penal practice the analysisof circumstancesused in gauging
the crime, so [one sees [penal discourse and psychiatric
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} crossing each other\'s frontiers; and
there, at their point of junction, is [[formed the]{.mark} notion of the
[\'dangerous\' individual]{.mark}, which makes it possible [to draw
up]{.mark} a network of [causality in terms of]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
entire [biography]{.mark} and to present a verdict of
punishment-correction]{.underline}.14 [The delinquent]{.underline} is
also to be distinguished from the offender in that he [is not only the
author of his acts (the author responsible in terms of certain criteria
of free, consciouswill), but is linked to his offence by a whole bundle
of complex threads (instincts, drives,
tendencies,character]{.underline}). [The]{.underline} [penitentiary
technique bears]{.underline} not on the relation betweenauthor and
crime, but [on the criminal\'s affinity with his crime]{.underline}. The
delinquent, the strange manifestation of an overall phenomenon of
criminality, is to be found in quasi-natural classes, each endowed with
its own characteristicsand requiring a specific treatment, what
Marquet-Wasselot called in r84r the\'ethnography of the prisons\';
[\'The convicts are . .. another people within the same people; with its
own habits, instincts, morals\']{.underline} (Marquet- Wasselot, p). We
are still very close here to the \'picturesque\' descriptions of the
world of the malefactors- an old tradition that goes back a long way and
gained new vigour in the early nineteenth century, at a time when the
perception of another form of life was being articulated upon that of
another class and another human species.A zoology of social
sub-speciesand an ethnology of the civilizations of malefactors,with
their own rites and language,was beginning to emerge in a parody form.
But an attempt was also being made to constitute a new obiectivity in
which [the criminal belongs to a typology that is both natural and
deviant]{.underline}. [[Delinquency]{.mark}, [a pathological gap in the
human species]{.mark}, [may be analysed]{.mark} as morbid
syndromes]{.underline} or as great teratological forms. With Ferrus\'s
classifica- tion, we probably have one of the first conversions of the
old \'ethnography\' of crime into a systematic typology of delinquens.
The analysis is slender, certainly, but it reveals quite clearly the
principlc that delinquency must be specified in terms not so much of the
law as of the norm. There are three types of convicq there are thosewho
areendowed \'with intellectual resourcesabove the average of
intelligencethat we haveestablished\',but who havebeenperverted either
by the \'tendenciesof their organization\' and a \'native pre-
disposition\', or by \'pernicious logic\', an \'iniquitous morality\', a
\'dangerous attitude to social duties\'. Those that belong to this cat-
egory require isolation day and night, solitary exercise,and, when one
is forced to bring them into contact with the others, they should
wear\'a light mask made of metal netting, of the kind used for stone-
cutting or fencing\'. The secondcategory is madeup of \'vicious, stupid
or passiveconvicts, who have been led into evil by indifference to
either shameor honour, through cowardice, that is to say, laziness, and
becauseof a lack of resistanceto bad incitements\'; the rdgime
suitableto them is not so much that of punishmentasofeducation, and if
possible of mutual education: isolation at night, work in common during
the day, conversationspermitted provided they are conducted aloud,
readingin common, followed by mutual questioning, for which rewards may
be given. Lastly, there are the \'inept or incapable convicts\', who
are\'rendered incapable,by an incomplete organiza- tion, of any
occupation requiring considered effort and consistent will, and who are
therefore incapable of competing in work with intelligent workers and
who, having neither enough education to know their social duties, nor
enough intelligence to understand this fact or to struggle against their
personal instincts, are led to evil by their very incapacity. For these,
solitude would merely encourage their inertia; they must therefore live
in common, but in such a way as to form small groups, constantly
stimulated by collective operations, and subjected to rigid
surveillance\' (Ferrus, r8zff and 278tr). Thus [[a \'positive\'
knowledge of]{.mark} the [delinquents]{.mark} and their
species]{.underline}, [very [different from]{.mark} [the
juridical]{.mark} definition of [offences]{.mark} and their
circumstances, [is]{.mark} gradually [established]{.mark};]{.underline}
but this knowledge is also distinct from the medical knowledge that
makes it possible to introduce the insanity ofthe individual and,
consequently,to efface the criminal character of the act. Ferrus states
the principle quite clearly: \'Considered as a whole, criminals are
nothing less than madmenl it would be unjust to the latter to confuse
them with consciously perverted men.\' [The task of this new knowledge
is [to define the act\'s cientifically\' qua offence]{.mark} and above
all the individual qua delinquent. Criminology is thus made
possible]{.underline}. . The correlative of penal justice may well be
the offendir, but [the correlative of the penitentiary apparatusis
someone other; this is the delinquent, a biographical unity, a kernel
ofdanger, representing a type of anomaly]{.underline}. And, although it
is true that to a detention that deprives of liberty, as defned by law,
the prison added the addi- tional element of the penitentiary, this
penitentiary element intro- duced in turn a third character who slipped
berween the individual condemned by the law and the individual who
carries out this law. At the point [[that marks the disappearance
of]{.mark} [the]{.mark} branded, dis- membered, burnt, annihilated body
of the [tortured criminal]{.mark}, there appeared the body of [the
prisoner]{.mark}, [duplicated by the individuality of the
\'delinquent\']{.mark}, [by the]{.mark} little [soul of the
criminal]{.mark}, which the very apparatus of punishment fabricated as a
point of application of the power to punish and [as the object
of]{.mark} what is still called today [penitentiary
science]{.mark}]{.underline}.It is said that the [[prison fabricated
delinquents]{.underline}]{.mark}; it is true that it brings back, almost
inevitably, before the courts those who have been sent there. But it
also fabricates them in the sense that [it has introduced into the
operation ofthe law and the offence, the judge and the offender, the
condemned man and the executioner, the non-corporal reality of the
delinquency that links them together]{.underline} and, for a century and
a half, has caught them in the sametrap. [[The penitentiary technique
and the delinquent]{.mark} [are]{.mark} in a sense twin
**[brothers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is not true that it was the
discovery of the delinquent through a scientific rationality that
introduced into our old prisons the refinement of penitentiary
techniques. Nor is it true that the internal elaboration of penitentiary
methods has finally brought to light the \'objective\' existenceof a
delinquency that the abstraction and rigidity of the law were unable to
perceive. [They appeared together]{.underline}, the one extending from
the other, as a technological ensemblethat forms and fragments the
object to which it appliesits instmments. And it is this
[delinquency]{.underline}, [formed in the foundations of the judicial
apparatus]{.underline},among the\'basseseuTtres\', the servile tasks,
from which justice avertsits gaze,out of the shameit feelsin punish- ing
those it condemns, it is this delinquency that now comes to haunt the
unuoubled courts and the majesty of the laws; [it is this
[delinquency]{.mark} that [must be known]{.mark}, assessed, measured,
[diagnosed]{.mark}]{.underline}, treated when sentencesare passed. [It
is]{.underline} now this [delinquency]{.underline}, this anomaly, this
deviation, [this potential danger, this illness, this form of
existence,that must be taken into account when the codes are
rewritten]{.underline}. [[Delinquency is the vengeance of the prison on
justice]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a revenge formidable enough to leave
the judge speechless. It is at this point that the criminologists raise
their voices. But we must not forget that the prison, that concentrated
and austerefigure of all the disciplines, is not an endogenous element
in the penal system as defined at the turn of the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries. The theme of a punitive society and of a general
semio-techniqueof punishment that has sustainedthe \'ideological\'
codes - Beccarian or Benthamite \* did not itself give rise to the
universal use of the prison. This prison camefrom elsewhere- from the
mechanismsproper to a disciplinary power. Now, despite this
heterogeneity, the mechanismsand effectsof the prison have spread right
through modern criminal justice; delinquency and the delin- quents have
becomeparasiteson it through and through. One must seekthe reasonfor
this formidable \'efficiency\' of the prison. But gne thing may be noted
at the outset: the [penal justice]{.underline} defined in the eighteenth
century by the reformers [traced two]{.underline} possible but diver-
gent [lines of objectification of the criminal: the **[first]{.mark}**
was the series of [\'monsters\']{.mark}, moral or political, who had
[fall]{.mark}en [outside the social pact]{.mark}; the
**[second]{.mark}** was that of [the juridical subject rehabilitated by
punishment]{.mark}.Now [the \'delinquent\']{.mark} makesit possibleto
[join]{.mark} [the two]{.mark} Iines and [to constitute]{.mark} under
[the authority of]{.mark} medicine, [psychology]{.mark} or criminology,
[an individual in whom the]{.mark} [offender]{.mark} of the law
[and]{.mark} [the object of a scientific technique are
superimposed]{.mark}]{.underline}- or almost - [one [upon the
other]{.mark}]{.underline}. That the grip ofthe prison on the penal
system should not have led to a violent reaction of rejection is no
doubt due to many reasons.One of theseis that, [[in fabricating
delinquency]{.mark}, [it gave]{.mark} to [criminal justice]{.mark} a
unitary field of objects, [authenticated by the \'sciences\']{.mark},
[and]{.mark} thus [enabled it to function]{.mark} [on a]{.mark} general
[horizon of \'truth\']{.mark}, [The prison]{.mark}, that darkest region
in the apparatusof justice, is the place where the power to punish,
which no longer dares to manifest itself openly, silently [organizes a
field of obiectivity in which]{.mark} punishment will be able to
function openly as treatment and [the sentence be inscribed among the
discourses of knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is understandable that
justice should have adopted so easily a prison that was not the
offspring of its own thoughts. Justice certainly owed the prison this
recognition. z. Illegalities and delinquency

#### Trials ensure the discursive power of the penal state is applied to rehabilitate the victim, not merely the perpetrator, creating a spectacle in rape trials to reify dominant patriarchal views of the female psyche to discourage rape prosecution and feminist projects.

Introduction This chapter investigates the pedagogical role played by
the discourse of English legal decisions on rape trials. This analysis
owes a lot to the work of Michel Foucault, in particular to his book
Discipline and Punish (1991) which traces the evolution of criminal
justice systems from Medieval torture to Enlightenment's punishment to
modern discipline. Foucault argues that until the late eighteenth
century, punishment was frequently the public spectacle of torture:
prisoners would be flogged, put on the pillory and even executed in open
squares. From then on, however, the entire economy of punish- ment began
to change: torture disappeared as a public spectacle, punishment became
the most hidden part of the penal process, and the body ceased to be the
only target of penal repression. [The body began to be exposed to new
techniques that]{.underline} aimed to render it 'docile', in other words
able to be sub- jected, used, transformed and improved. In Foucault's
words, 'these methods, which made possible the meticulous control of the
operations of the body, which assured the constant subjection of its
forces and [imposed upon them a relation of
**docility-utility**]{.underline}, might be called "disciplines"' (1991,
p. 137; my emphasis). Foucault argues that while the ancient forms of
penality, such as torture and death addressed the body of the condemned,
modern forms of penality, for example, incarceration, address their
soul. It is over the souls (subjectiv- ities) of men and women that the
microphysics of judicial power is exercised. The reform of criminal law
(from torture to punishment to discipline) introduced a new economy of
the power to punish, which was then rendered more regular, effective,
constant and detailed, and which began to operate at a lesser cost. [The
idea was 'not to punish less, but to punish better; to punish with an
attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more
universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply
into the social body']{.underline} (Foucault, 1991, p. 82). In short, [a
move from coercion to consent]{.underline}. 1 [As punishment became
hidden, it left the realm of everyday perception and entered that of
abstract consciousness]{.underline}; Foucault points out that in the
modern economy of criminal justice systems [it is the certainty and the
reach of punishment, rather than its spectacle, which must render
punishment effective and discourage crime]{.underline}. To achieve this
internal- isation of the power to punish, [discipline is vital;
individuals must be docile, amenable to subjection, to the subtle grip
of disciplinary power]{.underline}. [Disciplinary power is realised
through]{.underline} three basic instruments: (1) [hier- archical
observation]{.underline}; (2) [normalising judgement]{.underline};
[and]{.underline} (3) [examination]{.underline} (ibid.). Applying this
to the judicial discourse on rape, we can say that all of the three
instruments of disciplinary power are present in legal decisions --
[[judges]{.mark} have the hierarchical right to [observe]{.mark} the
social and sexual behaviour of women and men; they judge [human
behaviour, categorising some actions as 'abnormal' or
'criminal']{.mark}]{.underline} (outside the social pact), [[and others
as 'acceptable' or 'excusable']{.underline}]{.mark} (within the social
pact); [and to arrive at these categories, judges rely on expert
evaluations (made by doctors, psychiatrists and probation
officers]{.underline}). According to Foucault, examination is the most
import- ant technique of discipline. [Examination leads to the
documentation of people, enabling on the one hand individual
descriptions, and on the other hand the compiling of statistics and
generalisations]{.underline}. As I will argue in this chapter, [the
judicial discourse of legal decisions]{.underline} [relies]{.underline}
both [on medical and psychiatric examinations to classify, instruct and
discipline rape defendants and rape complainants]{.underline}. The
pedagogical function of legal decisions In modern times, it is no longer
necessary to discipline exclusively the body. Now that forms of
surveillance and control have been individually internal- ised (mainly
[through]{.underline} [discursive practices]{.underline}), [the object
of discipline and punishment is the soul, conceptualised in terms of the
psyche, subjectivity, personality, consciousness and
individuality]{.underline} (Smart, 1983). Discourse plays a crucial role
in the discipline of subjectivities and consciousnesses.
[[Women]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[are discursively trained
to police and control]{.mark} [their own behav- iour]{.mark} and the
behaviour of others, [without the need for coercion or external
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lees, 1997). [[For those who have
difficulty internalising the habits of self-surveillance and
self-correction]{.underline}]{.mark} (non-conformists, rule-breakers)
[[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} several
**[[panoptic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**[disciplinary]{.mark}**
[mechanisms to supervise, discip- line and rehabilitate]{.mark}
[individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One of these mechanisms is the [rape
trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. 2 According to Foucault, different
[discourses]{.underline} [transformed]{.underline} areas such as
[sexuality and crime into objects of scientific]{.underline} [knowledge
and targets for insti- tutional practices]{.underline}. Applying his
view to rape trials, we can interpret the discursive practices of
judges, for instance, as tools in a complex pedagogy of behaviour
constructed and realised through [[legal discourse]{.underline}]{.mark},
a pedagogy which [[aims to supervise, discipline, educate and control
the way]{.mark} men and [women behave socially and
sexually]{.mark}]{.underline}. From this viewpoint, no legal trial and
legal sentence are the judgement and punishment of an isolated
individual; the discourse of lawyers, prosecutors and judges also
represents the social- cultural evaluation of human behaviour, the
setting of examples, an attempt to recompose normality and restore the
social pact. In trial proceedings and legal decisions we can
[see]{.underline} two forms of penality at work: the penality of the law
-- legal rules, the opposition of 'legal' and 'illegal' acts and so on
etc -- and [the penality of the norm -- the [trial represents a space
for]{.mark} a broader form of pedagogy, which works by [setting
examples]{.mark} to be followed, [by attempting to homogenise,
normalise,]{.mark} bring 'offenders' back to the social pact (through
rehabilitation) or exclude them from society (through
condemnation]{.underline}) (Foucault, 1991). In short, the restorative
and educational roles of legal punishment could extend to those who have
broken not legal but moral or cultural rules. [Take [rape
complainants]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance. [[They have not]{.mark}
[been charged]{.mark} with a criminal offence, and therefore cannot be
the object of direct penal punishment]{.underline} (for example, loss of
money or of freedom). However, [[during the rape trial the victim's body
is exposed in a representational form, the events are reenacted, details
are discussed]{.mark}, [a]{.mark}n atmosphere of the circus (of a
**[spectacle]{.mark}**) [is created]{.mark}. If we interpret the rape
trial as a pedagogy of sexual behaviour]{.underline}, as I am doing in
this chapter, we can argue that [[the discourse of rape trials has
'side- effects']{.mark} which reach far [beyond the]{.mark} confines of
the [courtroom]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Seen as a symbolic event, a rape
trial establishes for the defendant and the complain- ant, as well as
for men and women in general, the forms of behaviour which guarantee
social and legal protection, and those which lead to exposure and
punishment. [Fear of symbolic punishment is enough to prevent many women
from reporting a rape]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hall, 1985; Adler, 1987;
Edwards, 1996). [[Their silence indicates that women have internalised
the notion that they should learn to avoid male violence and to keep
quiet about it]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Bumiller, 1991). 3 To
illustrate the argument that the judicial discourse on rape is inserted
within a complex pedagogical process, I will discuss in this chapter a
very specific type of legal decisions: reported appeal decisions. In
what follows, I will briefly describe and delimit the texts I have
analysed. A reported appel- late decision on a rape trial (or reported
decision) is a type of text where gender relations and power relations
overlap. Reported appellate decisions (or RADs for short) are the
decisions reported from the higher courts and published in official law
reports, which form the basic units of what lawyers call 'case law'
(Radford, 1987). In order to situate these texts, I will point out
exactly where they fit in a sequence of judicial procedures: a crime or
felony is initially judged by a first instance court, presided over by a
single judge, and sometimes a jury (in the British legal system, these
courts are the Magistrates' Court or the Crown Court). In this first
level the defendant may be considere guilty or not guilty; if found
guilty, he/she will be sentenced. If the first instance verdict and
sentence is unsatisfactory for the defendant, he/she may appeal to a
higher court (in England, the Divisional Court of Queen's Bench, Crown
Court or Court of Appeal). The Court of Appeal, which judges appeals on
more serious cases (for example, rapes), and where three judges
typically sit, will produce a new decision entitled 'appellate
decision', main- taining or altering, partially or entirely, the
previous decision. The most important of these decisions are then
published in law reports. For organisational purposes, three sections
follow dealing with functions of a custodial sentence of rape;
interdiscursivity (the 'discourses of man' and legal discourse); and the
control of the body (bio-power). All the excerpts used as illustrations
were taken from appeals published in the Criminal Appeal Reports (Sweet
& Maxwell) and the All England Law Reports (Butterworths) between 1987
and 1998. The excerpts are individually num- bered, each number
representing one reported appeal decision. The words or sentences
highlighted in italics within each excerpt are the ones I wish to focus
on as they better illustrate the pedagogical role of legal decisions
(although these italics do not reflect the emphasis of the originals).
Functions of a custodial sentence for rape

#### Modern, Foucauldian rape trials are inverse punishments, seeking absolute, panoptical knowledge of a woman's body and mind to both rationalize a lenient punishment for the rapist and to construct a deterrent spectacle of the woman to prevent further prosecutions of other men due to the fear that other women will suffer the same punishment as her if they seek justice. Even if we don't win Foucault theories, the neg forcing bad experiences of trials for rape and domestic violence survivors is independent offense

Interdiscursivity: the 'discourses of man' and legal discourse In his
genealogical analysis of history, Foucault (1991) investigates the
interplay between the structuring of the social domain and the
multiplicity of discourses emanating from the human sciences (Smart,
1983, p. 66). One of the areas of the social domain which was structured
and influenced by the discourses of the social sciences was the criminal
justice system. The social sciences, or 'the sciences of man', as
Foucault calls them, resulted from the disciplines as a whole new corpus
of knowledge, techniques and 'scientific' discourses which became
entangled in the mechanics of legal punishment. The sciences of man
provided legal punishment with a hold on the condemned's soul: an
assessment and a description not only of what criminals do, but also of
who they are, will be, may be (Foucault, 1991). [[A trial is]{.mark} no
longer concerned merely with establishing the truth of a crime and its
proper punishment but]{.underline}, as Smart contends (1983, p. 72): [It
constitutes a context within which there occurs an assessment of
normality and the for- mulation of [prescriptions for **enforced
normalisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A series of subsidiary authorities
have achieved a stake in the penal process; [psychiatrists,
psychologists, doctors, educationalists and social workers share in the
judgement of normality, prescribe normalising treatment and contribute
to the process of fragmentation of the legal power to
punish]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [human]{.underline}
[sciences]{.underline} of psychiatry, psychology, gynaecology, pedagogy
and criminology all [have the same roots: the procedures of
individualisation, of measurement, diagnosis and treatment of individual
bodies]{.underline}, introduced by the disciplinary methods of the 18th
and 19th centuries. Discipline and its tools (psychiatric and medical
expertise) have penetrated the penal process, from investigation and
judgement to punishment (Smart, 1983, p. 72). The mingling of the trial
process with sciences such as psychology and psychiatry has apparently
purified and cleansed legal proceedings from their hard, cold and
impersonal nature. In fact, [what it has done is to transfer power from
one site to another, or better, to integrate different sites of power,
thus making them stronger]{.underline}. Fairclough (1995) claims that
[when one expert system relies on another to construct its discourse,
this reinforces its power structure. By resorting to scientific
discourses, judicial discourse also increases its power by endowing
itself with extra scientificity and rationality]{.underline}. The
excerpt below illustrates the intimate link between psy-discourses and
legal discourse: 10 [[A]{.mark} social [inquiry]{.mark} report
[commented]{.mark} that [there was no doubting]{.mark} the appellant's
[remorse]{.mark} for his victim's suffering [and]{.mark} the deep
[shame]{.mark} which he was currently experiencing. It stated
[he]{.mark} had [attempted suicide]{.mark}]{.underline}. Also before the
Court was a report from a consultant psychiatrist who noted that [[the
appellant was]{.mark} [the youngest]{.mark} of six children in the
family, an [over- protected]{.mark} [child]{.mark} showing early
neurotic signs, [devastated by his mother's]{.mark} [death]{.mark} when
he was 12. Thereafter he showed general signs of delinquency,
instability and a tendency to drug taking and alcohol
abuse]{.underline}. He led an increasingly criminal lifestyle, chaotic,
nomadic, much of it nocturnal, finding greater security in the criminal
fraternity than within his family circle. The offence itself appeared to
the psychiatrist to be 'out of character'. [His mental profile did not
indicate the need either for violence or a habitually aberrant sexual
lifestyle. [The rape occurred at a time of]{.mark} chaos, insecurity and
humiliation with life when, it was said, his judgements, control and
perceptions were very severely reduced by [drug and alcohol
intake]{.mark}. His remorse and regret were genuine. [The doctor
expressed]{.mark} [concern]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the ['self
damaging]{.mark} [potential]{.mark} which his ruminations may cause',
and recommended professional counselling, together with guidance and
support]{.underline}. Although his potential for dangerousness needs to
be examined, [the psychiatrist thought he could not be regarded as a
serious danger within the community]{.underline}. \[McIntosh (1994) 15
Cr.App.R.(S.) 162 -- stranger rape -- 9-year sentence reduced to 7\] In
the example above, [the use of [psychiatric expertise]{.mark}
[helps]{.mark} legal discourse to [establish]{.mark} a relation of
[causality]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [the]{.mark} defendant's
psychological [profile and lifestyle]{.mark}]{.underline} (drug abuse,
emotional problems) and his crime. Excerpt 10 is a classic example of
the use of social-work discourse and psy- chiatric discourse as a
support for a more 'humane' legal decision. The social and [[psychiatric
profiles give support to a **paternal**]{.mark} judicial view of the
[appel- lant,]{.mark} depicting him as [a young man 'to be **pitied'**
and **helped**]{.mark}, and]{.underline} thus [reducing his sentence by
two years]{.underline}. [The diagnostic assessments present in penal
judgement extend]{.underline} not just to the defendant, but also [to
the complainant]{.underline} (she too is evaluated by doctors and
psychiatrists to establish the physical evidence of the rape, her
'trauma', her profile): 11 That was evidenced by a psychiatric report
from Dr Jasper dated January 19, 1993, which was before the learned
judge. Dr Jasper examined the victim on four occasions prior to the
offender being sentenced . . . She found that the victim was then
suffering from a post- traumatic stress disorder which, she said,
includes: 'symptoms of flashback (re-experiencing the event), intrusive
thoughts and images relating to the traumatic event, nightmares, acute
disturb- ance, depression, anxiety and irritability, all of which Sarah
has experienced since the rape'. \[Attorney-General's Reference (no. 3
of 1993) (W) \[1994\] 98 Cr.App.R. 85 -- stranger rape -- community
service sentence increased to 2 years imprisonment\] 12 Fifteen years'
imprisonment for rape of an elderly woman by an intruder in her home
reduced to 13 years. The appellant broke into the home of a woman aged
74 in the early hours of the morn- ing. He pressed a knife at her
throat, and threatened to kill her. The woman resisted and the appellant
attacked with some violence and raped her. The appellant told the victim
that he had AIDS. The woman was subsequently admitted to hospital
suffering from depression. Sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. On March
18, 1992, [she was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose of
sleeping tablets and anti-depressants]{.underline}. The medical report
[before the judge and before this Court indicated that she was suffering
at that time from depression]{.underline}, although it is right to say
that there were causes other than, and in addition to, this appalling
experience which contributed to that depression. \[Guniem (1994) 15

In the two extracts above, [the [judges]{.mark} [borrow]{.mark}ed from
[psychiatric]{.mark} and [med- ical reports]{.mark} [to]{.mark} describe
the traumatic effects of the rape on the victims and to [depict them as
'genuine' victims and their assailants as 'true'
rapists]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the modern style of legal punishing,
other '[**[discourses of man']{.mark}** share with the juridical
discourse the responsibility of evaluating, categorising, edu- cating
and punishing both offender and victim]{.underline}. The legal power to
educate, discipline and punish has been fragmented and divided among
magistrates, 'psy' experts, educators, social workers, prison personnel,
and so forth. As Lees points out, 'power is not a possession, as radical
feminists have argued, but is seen as embedded in the discourses of
medicine, law, psychology and the social sciences' (1997, p. 12). The
control of the body (bio-power) The final section of this chapter deals
with the use of [the judicial discourse on rape [as a way of better
controlling the bodies of women]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With]{.underline}
the creation of the disciplines, especially [the]{.underline}
disciplinary mechanism of [exam- ination, the body became the object or
target of new forms of power exercised with the help of]{.underline}
scientific (for example, [medical]{.underline}) [knowledge]{.underline}.
The examination, and the process of documentation that accompanied it,
allowed the constitution of the individual as an analysable, describable
object. The disciplinary technique of examination was also vital for the
surveillance, control and punishment of individuals. The new individual
created by the processes of examination and docu- mentation is, as
already pointed out, a calculable man (sic). According to Foucault, a
mastery of the body and knowledge of its forces constitutes 'a political
technology of the body'. That technology is diffuse and cannot be
located in a particular institution or state apparatus. What the
institu- tions and apparatuses do is to operate 'a micro-physics of
power' (1991, p. 26), in other words, they observe, analyse and document
the human body (thus functioning as a laboratory to enlarge the
knowledge about the body), and supervise and discipline the uses we put
our bodies to (thus fulfilling an educational function). The judicial
discourse on sexual crimes is one vehicle through which power over the
body is exercised. Male and female bodies are diagnosed, treated and
imprisoned during or as a result of a rape trial; [[women are depicted
and]{.mark} [judged]{.mark} as being constituted [by their sex]{.mark};
female [virginity]{.mark} and [reputation]{.mark}, or
[unfaithfulness]{.mark} and [promiscuity]{.mark}, all marked in the
body, are protected or [disciplined to safeguard women's social worth
and social norms]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the discourse of rape trials,
[[the body is a main target]{.mark} of legal and [microforms of
power]{.mark}]{.underline} (the penality of the law and the penality of
the norm). To illustrate this view, I will discuss the links between the
discourse of rape trials and pornography. Descriptions of female bodies
and of rapes as pornography

One example of institutional examination and control of the body is the
descriptions of female bodies found in rape trials and legal sentences
on rape cases. Reported appellate decisions on cases of rape vary in the
way they describe the event and the complainant: some are discreet and
almost laconic, while others give detailed and graphic accounts of the
rape. If some appellate decisions are laconic about the details of the
rape, the same cannot be said about [[the trial]{.mark}, [where
**every**]{.mark}]{.underline} single [[**detail** of the event and of
the victim's body is scrutinised and debated]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
the opinion of the American legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon (1987),
[[rape trials and porn]{.mark}- ography share a common link: [both
publicly portray and evaluate the female body]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
victim's testimony during the trial has also been compared with a
pornographic vignette: the details of male penetration can give pleas-
ure as with other pornographic materials]{.underline}. 5 [In rape
trials, as in pornographic texts, the events are constructed in fine
detail]{.underline} (including for example, [where the woman was
touched, who removed her knickers, if she had a period or
not]{.underline}). [During most rape trials [the complainant is forced
to describe minutely]{.mark} which parts of [her body]{.mark} were
assaulted]{.underline}, and in which ways; these descriptions,
[which]{.underline} [would **embarrass** women even in private
circumstances, are particularly **[humiliating]{.mark}** when given in
public, [in]{.mark} front of [an audience]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
paradox is that [[the]{.mark} very [use of language to describe]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} sexual parts and functions of a woman's [body]{.mark} is
sufficient to [render her **unrespectable**]{.mark} in the
courtroom]{.underline}, as will be evidenced in the excerpts below.
[[Giving evidence]{.mark} in court [can]{.mark} [be]{.mark} interpreted
as a way of '[shaming' the complainant, of exposing her to public
scrutiny and contempt]{.mark}, [of disciplining and punishing
her]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lees, 1997). And [the graphic details of
female bodies are not restricted to courtroom discourse. [The
detailed]{.mark} (and probably [distressing]{.mark}) [descriptions of
the rape given by rape complainants]{.mark}, plus evidence from medical
examinations, also [find their way into legal
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we can see in the extracts below: 13
He then began an act of intercourse with her. She objected, and took her
hands away from his buttocks where she had had to place them. She took
her hands away to wipe her mouth, and then she tried to put her hand
between his body and hers. He said to her, angrily, that she must put
her hands back on his buttocks. She did so, and he put his penis back in
her mouth. While it was there he kept thrusting; because of the force of
his thrusting she choked and began to, as she described it, 'urge' --
or, as one would suppose she meant, 'retch'. He asked her why she was
doing that. She replied that he had 'pushed it too far back'. He
continued with what he was doing, albeit not pushing as far back as he
had before. Throughout the whole of this episode the knife was at the
nape of her neck. He then stopped, withdrew his penis from her mouth and
said, 'Get on the bed'. She lay on the bed. He told her to get on her
front and instructed her to kneel, and put her head down and her hands
behind her back. She obeyed. With her kneeling in that position he put
his penis into her vagina. She could feel the knife in the region of her
neck the whole while. He continued the act of sexual intercourse. She
did not co-operate and he said to her, 'You can do better than that. If
you help me you will live, if you don't you will die; I am going to die
tonight anyway'. So she did something to appease him. Although he was to
continue the intercourse for some little time, that is a sufficient
description of the events for the purposes of this case. \[Kowalski
(1988) 86 Cr.App.R. 338 -- marital rape -- 4-year sentence reduced to
2\] Extract 13 presents detailed descriptions of the rape. In it the
judges seem a little embarrassed by their lengthy description ('Although
he was to continue the intercourse for some little time, that is a
sufficient description of the events for the purposes of this case'),
which does not happen in the following excerpt: 14 On March 7, 1996 he
went to see his doctor to discuss a referral to the marriage guidance
organisation know as Relate. The complainant came home shortly after he
did and saw him come into the house with a carrier bag. When she came
into the house, he grabbed her by the throat and he pushed her down on
the sofa. He pushed her face into a cushion, so that she was frightened
that she was going to suffocate. He held her down with a tea towel
across the back of her neck. She asked him not to kill her or to hurt
her. He then said that he would not hurt her so long as she kept quiet
and did not struggle. He said that he wanted to 'fuck her' and that it
was going to last a few hours as he 'made the most of it'. He then took
off most of his wife's clothing. She removed her own necklace and she
hid her broken glasses down the back of the sofa for fear that he would
strangle or cut her. He then took stockings which he had purchased out
of the carrier bag and made his wife put them on. He ripped the
remainder of her clothes. He then pene- trated her against her will. He
forced her to go into the kitchen with him to fetch some wine from the
refrigerator. He placed cushions on the floor, forced her to kneel on
all fours and then pene- trated her again. He forced her to perform oral
sex, holding the back of her head and threatening to hurt her. He told
her that he was thinking of tying her up. He hit her with a tea towel.
He then took her upstairs, saying that he was going to 'defile her
little nest'. He then attempted to pene- trate her whilst holding her
against the bedroom door. He took her into the bedroom, forced her to
put the stockings on with a suspender belt and forced his penis into her
mouth. He then penetrated her again. \[Michael H (1997) 2 Cr.App.R.(S.)

14 is the one which most [resembles pornography]{.underline}, [evidenced
in the mentions of erotic lingerie (stockings and suspender belt), an
erotic scene (the cushions on the floor, the wine, the language used by
the assailant), the threat of 'bondage' ('he told her he was thinking of
tying her up'), and finally the threats and the use of violence (he
tried to suffocate her, he hit her with a tea towel, he threatened to
hurt her and to tie her up]{.underline}), [which [conjures up a
sado-masochistic]{.mark} [scenario]{.mark}]{.underline} (this feature is
present in the two excerpts). [The distressing experience of giving
evidence in court, [the]{.mark} frequent prac- tice of
**[character]{.mark}** **[assassination]{.mark}** carried out
[by]{.mark} defence [lawyers and]{.mark}]{.underline} even [by
judges]{.underline}, [and [the fear of having the most intimate details
of one's life publicly discussed, laughed at or]{.mark} even [enjoyed as
erotic material]{.mark}, [are indications of what awaits women who file
a complaint]{.mark} of rape, [and]{.mark} probably [leads many]{.mark}
of them [to keep quiet about]{.mark} male sexual violence]{.underline}.
Final remarks In this chapter, [based on a Foucauldian]{.underline} view
of the [criminal justice]{.underline} system, I have interpreted the
judicial discourse on rape as part of a pedagogy of sexual behaviour.
From this perspective, [[rape]{.mark} trials serve several educational
aims]{.underline}: they discipline and punish the individual offender;
they set 'proper' and 'improper' modes of behaviour both for the
offender and other potential offenders; they serve as warnings to people
in general. The warning function extends the discourse of rape trials
and of legal decisions beyond the confines of the courtroom and even of
the legal environment; the judicial discourse on rape serves as [warning
and example both to those directly involved with the trial (offender and
victim) and to women and men in general]{.underline}. The educational
aim of judicial discourse is furthered by the help of several
'discourses of men', such as the discourses of psychiatry and
psychology. Foucault claims that the legal power to punish has been
fragmented and divided among several disciplines which, through the
techniques of obser- vation, judgement and examination, help to
categorise people as 'normal' or 'abnormal', 'criminal' or 'innocent',
amenable to rehabilitation or beyond recuperation. The discourses of
medicine, psychiatry and psychology also help to add scientificity to
legal discourse, somehow purging it of its harsh and cold punitive
character. The idea is that the legal right to punish is not merely
about retribution and revenge, but that it also encompasses a humane
view of criminals. [The disciplinary techniques of observation,
judgement and examination present in rape trials also serve to
strengthen the hold over the body, and to increase its docility and its
usefulness]{.underline}. [The bodies and minds of rape victims are
scrutinised to determine relations of causality and responsibility, to
assess the seriousness of the rape, and to portray the complainant
either as a 'genuine' or as a 'non-typical' victim. In this process,
[the bodies of women are]{.mark} trapped in minute and embarrassing
descriptions that resemble [porn]{.mark}- ography, [descriptions]{.mark}
[which]{.mark} also serve as [warn]{.mark}ing to [other women of the
**symbolic exposure** a rape]{.mark} [complainant goes
through.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Domestic violence trials prove how trials shift to the forceful psycho-medicalization and deviance-construction women who reject patriarchal conceptions of normalcy, such as totalizing submission to a male spouse.

As a result, when women such as Judy Norman resort to violence as a
means to defend themselves at a time when their abuser is not actively
battering them, they are routinely denied the chance to claim
self-defense.29 This is significant because a defendant may only
introduce evidence of the victim's violent character or history of abuse
at trial if they are given a jury instruction on self-defense.30 Without
a self-defense jury instruction, the defendant is unable to explain
crucial context of the crime to the jury and is more likely to receive a
harsh sentence.31 At the same time, [[the]{.mark} criminal [legal
system]{.mark} unjustifiably [**medicalizes** women's rational survival
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Medicalization is the social process by
which [human conditions or behaviors come to be defined and treated as
medical issues requiring diagnosis and treatment by the medical
system]{.underline}.32 Around the 1980s, attorneys for
survivor-defendants33 who were unable to satisfy the traditional
elements of self-defense began to ask courts to admit expert testimony
on "Battered Wife Syndrome."34 Battered Wife Syndrome---today, Battered
Spouse Syndrome---refers to a disproven and unscientific theory that
women who are subjected to repeated domestic abuse develop a mental
illness that prevents them from being able to escape abusive
relationships or rationally assess risk.35 [If]{.underline} such
[testimony was admitted, [a]{.mark} [defendant]{.mark} who
[otherwise]{.mark} would have been outright [denied a
self-defense]{.mark} jury instruction [could use the expert]{.mark} to
attempt [to explain]{.mark} [why she perceived]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
imminent [threat of danger]{.mark} [when an outside observer might
conclude that she were perfectly safe]{.mark}---such as when her abusive
husband is asleep]{.underline}.36 [While courts' permittance of
[Battered Spouse Syndrome evidence]{.mark} appears commendable
considering the lack of an alternative, it has ultimately
[proven]{.mark} [itself to be]{.mark} little more than an unjustified
and ineffective [reiteration of the **insanity**]{.mark}
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. The supposed syndrome that forms its
foundational premise has been entirely debunked.37 Subsequent scientific
research has proven that victims of domestic abuse do not consistently
respond as the theory would predict.38 [[It]{.mark} baselessly
[claims]{.mark} that [women are suffering from some **defect of the
mind** which caused their violent reaction]{.mark}, [when]{.mark} in
actuality, [these reactions are]{.mark} often [rational and necessary
acts of survival]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 Abuse victims who engage in
rational survival actions after pursuing every reasonable means of
escape are not sick with a mental illness.40 Therefore, [it is
nonsensical that survivor- defendants must claim they suffer from a
non-existent mental syndrome in order to have a jury consider their
self-defense claim]{.underline}. More importantly, being required to
frame their acts of self-defense as the symptom of a "syndrome"
undermines defendants' arguments that they were reasonably acting in
self-defense. This article will explore how [the survival actions of
domestic abuse victims are unjustly medicalized and criminalized by the
American legal system]{.underline}.41 Part II will examine why
[survivors of severe domestic abuse who use force to defend themselves
struggle to satisfy the traditional self-defense elements and why courts
began allowing Battered Spouse Syndrome evidence]{.underline}. It will
explore how [the Anglo-American legal system has historically failed to
protect women from their abusers]{.underline}, treat domestic abuse as a
serious legal issue, and treat women's defensive actions as
legitimate.42 Part III argues that [[requiring]{.mark} [women to
clothe]{.mark} their [self-defense claims]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
dressings of [Battered Spouse Syndrome]{.mark} unjustifiably
[**pathologizes** their]{.mark} rational survival [actions]{.mark},
[which]{.mark} confounds the jurisprudential underpinnings of excuse and
justification defenses for the jury and [results in]{.mark}
[survivor]{.mark}-defendants' [self-defense claims being
discredited]{.mark}]{.underline}. Part IV will argue that [courts must
refrain from applying medicalized language to criminal defendants and
that a specialized self-defense framework is warranted for
survivor-defendants]{.underline}. Rather than allowing only "syndrome"
evidence, survivor- [[defendants should be allowed to introduce]{.mark}
[evidence]{.mark} [regarding battering]{.mark} and its effects [without
the syndrome label]{.mark}]{.underline}. If the survivor- defendant is
able to produce a sufficient quantum of evidence indicating that her
abuse significantly contributed to the perpetration of her crime, the
jury should be allowed to consider the extent to which that abuse
mitigates the defendant's criminal responsibility, including and up to a
full legal exculpation from any criminal liability if the jury
determines that the defendant was acting in self-defense. II. BACKGROUND

#### Trial medicalization of deviance constructs the pathologized and helpless female subject whose self-defense is contingent on her ability to comport to that battered woman narrative, reifying gender roles, perpetuating domestic violence, and harming feminist agency and beliefs in a rational woman subject.

B. The Medicalization of Women's Survival Actions Sociologists use the
term medicalization to describe the social process by which a problem or
phenomenon comes to be defined and treated as medical.225
[Medicalization constructs certain behaviors, traits, or experiences as
**pathological** or abnormal]{.underline}---that is, deviant---by
framing them as a disorder or disease requiring medical treatment and
intervention.226 Put simply, [deviant behavior is "behavior not within
permissible conformity to social norms]{.underline}."227 When behavior
is labeled as deviant, people are discouraged from engaging in that
behavior, which operates as a form of social control.228 In order to
maximize adherence to social norms and minimize deviant behavior,
society utilizes both formal and informal forms of social control.229
Formal controls are "institutionalized forms of social control," such as
the criminal legal system and the medical system.230 Social deviance,
however, is relative and contextual: not all deviant behaviors result in
the same reaction from society.231 What behavior is labeled as deviant,
and how society responds, varies by social context.232 Moreover,
different deviant behaviors fall into different designations or
categories of deviance.233 Deviant behavior might be categorized as
criminal, sinful, pathological, immoral, or merely rude.234 Each
category of deviance warrants a different sanction.235 Furthermore,
[deviant behavior that was once defined as immoral or criminal can come
to be constructed as pathological or medical, and vice
versa]{.underline}.236 Although it might be expected that the
categorization of a certain deviant behavior as either crime or sickness
is made on the basis of scientific fact alone, [the process by which
something is defined as "a sin, a moral problem, a crime, or a sickness"
is actually the "product of a political process]{.underline}."237
[Take]{.underline}, for example, the construction of
[homosexuality]{.underline} in western society. Prior to the 1800s,
homosexual behavior was primarily seen as sinful.238 Overtime, it
transformed into a criminal act.239 During the 1900s, it was framed as a
"sexual patholog\[y\]" requiring medical treatment.240 Today, with
notable exceptions, queerness is increasingly viewed as a socially
acceptable and normal way of being that does not require criminal or
medical intervention.241 Whether a certain behavior is constructed as
sickness or crime matters because "\[t\]he social responses to crime and
illness are different."242 In the context of a criminal proceeding, the
label attached to an act determines which defense is appropriate.243
[The [Battered Spouse Syndrome]{.mark} theory **[medicalizes]{.mark}**
the rational survival actions of domestic abuse [survivors by casting
them as]{.mark} [psychologically disabled and]{.mark} entirely [passive
except for the final lethal act]{.mark}]{.underline}.244 In reality,
however, most survivors "employ ample measures to try to fend off and
end the abuse" prior to resorting to lethal violence.245 [The use of
[syndrome]{.mark} evidence unfairly [treats survivors as]{.mark}
[possessing]{.mark} some kind of [mental **infirmity** by failing to
leave abusive situations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[without
considering]{.mark} [the]{.mark} material and social realities of
[victim's lives]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}246 [[Medicalizing]{.mark}
[survivors frames their acts of survival as]{.mark} "abnormal or
[irrational]{.mark} [responses]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} ultimately
[deprives \[them of\] agency]{.mark} as rational
decisionmakers]{.underline}."247 Moreover, the admittance of [expert
testimony]{.underline} on Battered Spouse Syndrome [engenders
"unrealistic stereotypes of people subjected to abuse" in the minds of
the jury]{.underline}.248 "\[[[V\]ictims are often expected to assume
the demeanor of **helplessness**]{.mark}, to act as if they are [without
capacity to exercise their rights]{.mark}
independently]{.underline}."249 [[When a survivor does not
"perform]{.mark} their [victimization]{.mark}" as expected]{.underline}
by the jury after being told by an expert witness that she suffers from
a mental illness that disabled her to the point of complete helplessness
and impotency, [[her self-defense claim is]{.mark} frequently [viewed
with **suspicion**]{.mark} and discredited]{.underline}.250 Thus, [[when
a survivor]{.mark}-defendant's behavior and demeanor [does not fit
the]{.mark} "**[preconceived victimhood narrative]{.mark}**" required by
Battered Spouse Syndrome---that is, "[**weak**, **helpless**, and
**mentally impaired**]{.mark}"---the admittance of syndrome expert
[testimony]{.mark} [can]{.mark} do more to [harm]{.mark} than help
[the]{.mark} defendant's [self-defense claim]{.mark}]{.underline}.251
[[Women who do not conform to traditional gender roles face the greatest
likelihood]{.mark} that such medicalized expert [testimony will]{.mark}
make a jury less likely to believe their self-defense
claim]{.underline}.252 [Women who are perceived as tough]{.underline},
confident, independent, abrasive, argumentative, or angry [do not fit
the purported profile]{.underline} of a victim suffering from Battered
Spouse Syndrome, [resulting in jurors [discredit]{.mark}ing their
[self-defense]{.mark} claims]{.underline}.253 Paradoxically, [[when
there is evidence that a victim]{.mark} has [resisted her abuser]{.mark}
in the past, [her "behavior is perceived as aggressive" rather than
defensive]{.mark}]{.underline}.254 [Women who are queer or transgender,
are poor, engage in sex work, use alcohol or drugs, have a history of
being abused, or have a criminal history are less likely be seen as
"worthy victims]{.underline}" and be believed.255 [Women of
color]{.underline}, and in particular Black women, [are least likely
have their defensive actions interpreted as legitimate]{.underline}.256
Black women occupy a uniquely vulnerable position in society. Compared
to white women, they experience domestic violence at a
disproportionately higher rate and are more likely to be killed by an
intimate partner.257 At the same time, they are "disproportionately more
likely to be criminalized by the legal system" in relation to their
victimization.258 Black women are more likely to be arrested, more
likely to be detained, and more likely to be sentenced to a term of
imprisonment than white women.259 The disproportionate condemnation of
Black women's survival actions is "likely a function of the intersection
of racist stereotypes and discretion."260 In order to prevail in a
self-defense claim, the defendant must convince the judge and jury that
she was not the "initial aggressor."261 But numerous [racist stereotypes
that "paint Black \[women\] as hypersexual, boisterous, aggressive, and
unscrupulous" implicitly bias fact finders' perception of Black women as
aggressive]{.underline}.262 In particular, [the "Angry Black Woman"
trope]{.underline},263 which depicts Black women as "angry, loud,
aggressive, pushy, independent, street smart, mature, hypersexual,
threatening, and invulnerable to abuse,"264 [makes their claims of
victimization appear uncredible, because if a Black woman is angry and
aggressive, [she "must be a mutual combatant\[\]" rather than a genuine
victim]{.mark}]{.underline}.265 Moreover, studies show that beginning
around age five, Black girls are "more likely to be viewed as behaving
and seeming older than their stated age" and are perceived as needing
less protection and nurturing than white girls.266 Such adultification
of young Black girls deprives them of the protections extended to other
children in the legal system and contributes to fact finders construing
their acts of survival as intentionally criminal rather than as
legitimate exercises of self-defense.267 C. Justifications of Punishment
Applied to Survivor- Defendants

#### Trial's Foucauldian striving for positivist proof increases disciplinary control by legitimizing punishments in objective language.

The core epistemological values of science are rooted in the central,
defining concern of inquiry generally: finding things out. A scientific
inquirer starts with a question about what might explain this or that
natural or social phenomenon; makes an informed guess \[hypothesis
generating\]; and assesses how well his conjecture stands up to what
evidence is already available, or can be obtained: i.e., how firmly it
is anchored in experimental results and experimental evidence generally;
how well it interlocks with the whole explanatory mesh of the body of
thus-far well-warranted claims and theories; whether relevant evidence
might have been overlooked; and what else could be done to get hold of
evidence not presently available.79 At bottom, science is a skeptical
pursuit, one that is constituted by the ever-present question, "Why?"
Moreover, science is "inimical to the satisfaction of certain
\[institutional\] values,"80 because scientific skepticism "interferes
with the imposition of a new set of values which demand an unquestioning
acquiescence."81 This is an important insight as it directly pertains to
the competing narratives expressed by scientists who study natural and
social phenomena, and the courts and forensic practitioners who also lay
claim to empirical evidence (and for a far longer period of time). What
I mean is that there has always been an uncomfortable relationship
between science and its interaction with society more generally, and law
specifically. Haack contends that certain kinds of political regimes
seem to be inherently hostile environments for scientific work:
theocracies are likely to fear scientific discoveries that may threaten
their world-view to deplore scientific methods that offend their moral
sensibilities, and to be adamantly opposed to the very idea of
investigating certain questions.82 Despite Haack's reference to
theocracy (or perhaps it's an apt description), [forensic practitioners
and the courtroom]{.underline} working group83 that encourage them, also
[engage in a sort of theocratic commitment to their findings, as is
indicated by a strict adherence to **magical thinking**]{.underline}.
[Their mode of veridiction]{.underline}, the one that [they]{.underline}
routinely [resort to as established by positive law]{.underline},
includes the Frye standard's "general acceptance" criteria. Since it was
adopted by the courts in the 1923, it has had decades to [gain
prominence as]{.underline} the Archimedean point of departure in our
adversarial process since it represents the normatively operating
expression of [forensic expertise]{.underline} (stare decisis). In
short, [the norm for [judges]{.mark} is to [permit questionable]{.mark},
sometimes demonstrably false and [misleading]{.mark}, [forensic]{.mark}
[testimony]{.mark} at court since that's what it has always done, and in
doing so, it continues to perpetuate all manner of evidentiary
charlatanry]{.underline}. By way of contrast, [it is precisely the role
and responsibility of science to engage in "organized
skepticism]{.underline}," a kind of methodologically rigorous assessment
of "established routine, authority, vested procedures and the realm of
the 'sacred' generally."84 [It is the role of science to endlessly
question the taken-for-granted, the sedimented, those "sacred" beliefs
and their attendant procedures that have gained prominence over
time]{.underline}. Interesting, sociologist Robert K. Merton's analysis
of the role of science during the spread of Nazi fascism raises
important considerations insofar as he recognizes that [[the
scientific]{.mark} [method]{.mark} and its institutional gestalt [are
anathema to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} satisficing tendency of the
contemporary criminal legal system]{.underline}. Specifically, for
Merton, [The [spread of domination by]{.mark} one segment of [the social
structure]{.mark} -- [The State]{.mark} -- [involves]{.mark} [a
**demand** for]{.mark} primary **[loyalty]{.mark}** to it.... [The norms
of scientific ethos must be sacrificed]{.mark}, insofar [as they demand
a repudiation of the politically imposed criteria of scientific
validity]{.mark} or of scientific worth]{.underline}.85 And perhaps as
significant: "The expansion of political control thus introduces
conflicting loyalties."86 What Merton ascribes to fascist regimes is no
less of a concern in aspirational democratic ones like the United States
of America.87 [[Systemic demands for social control]{.mark}, as
manifested [through]{.mark}]{.underline} the administration of
[[law]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States, [[generate a]{.mark}
dialectical relationship between science and the political, economic,
and cultural demands for disciplining working class and poor
people]{.underline}. Once again, I defer to Merton's insight: "[The
conflict between the totalitarian state and the scientist derives in
part, then, from an [incompatibility]{.mark} [between]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} ethic of [science and]{.mark} the new [political
code]{.mark} which is imposed upon all, irrespective of occupational
creed]{.underline}."88 Why? Because "the ethos of science involves the
functionally necessary demand that theories or generalizations be
evaluated in terms of their logical consistency and consonance with
facts."89 In a previous remark I emphasized the dialectical interplay of
opposing forces represented by the continued use of unscientific
forensic practices, practices that have no error rate indicating the
likelihood that their findings may have occurred by chance, with
scientific research premised upon skepticism, sharing of methods and
data for reliability testing, in scientific peer-reviewed professional
journals. It is not solely the courtroom working group that has adopted
the hegemonic commitment to satisficing that occurs each time an
unscientific forensic practitioner testifies to individualization, by
its nature hegemonic discourse assumes popular use across civil society.
As such, how would the general public be properly situated to
effectively critique and juxtapose to rational criticism conclusions
drawn and officially rendered at court by unscientific practitioners?
[[With hegemonic veridiction]{.mark} emerging [by]{.mark} virtue of
nearly a century's worth of [judicial application]{.mark}, media
presentations primarily through television and
[film]{.mark}]{.underline},90 [[and Supreme Court affirmation]{.mark},
the cultural acquiescence]{.underline} that accompanies general
acceptance [should come as no surprise at all]{.underline}. [Largely as
a result of the commonsensical appearance of contemporary forensic
practices, the lay public is limited in its ability to challenge
normative practices]{.underline}. In fact, it is quite possible that
[[the **common-sense** comfort]{.mark} level [experienced by lay people
presented]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [well-known yet unscientific
practices]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., fingerprints, bite marks, tool
marks, shoe prints, ballistics, etc.) may, dialectically,
[[generate]{.mark} consequential **[hostility]{.mark}** [toward attempts
to introduce]{.mark}]{.underline} [[science]{.underline}]{.mark}. Merton
referred to just this phenomenon when he stated that "Partly as a result
of scientific advance, therefore, [[the]{.mark} [population]{.mark} at
large [has become ripe for **new mysticisms**]{.mark} [clothed
in]{.mark} apparently [scientific jargon]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This
promotes the success of propaganda generally]{.underline}."91 New
mysticisms. Magical Thinking. Propaganda. For example, as a critical
system steering mechanism, [the legal system's social control function
operates as part of a hegemonic system designed to promote and protect
dominant cultural interests]{.underline}. As part of that process,
systemic efficiency requires the smooth and expedient dispatching of
criminal cases. In order to satisfy systemic needs for predictability
and efficiency, criminal procedure must generate outcomes, most commonly
in the form of convictions, that at a minimum create the appearance of
institutional stability. [Introduction of [expert witness]{.mark}
testimony [provides systemic assurances]{.mark} that [any
outcomes]{.mark} leading to conviction and a loss of liberty [have been
met with empirical (though unscientific) evidence]{.mark} of
guilt]{.underline}. Herein lies the charlatanry. Herein lies Merton's
mysticism. Herein lies Malinowski's magical thinking. So long as most
states and the federal government adhered to Frye's general acceptance
standard, which continued to be supported well into the decade of the
1990s, and so long as the general public was in on the shared forensic
discourse, a commonsensical interpretation of the application of
forensic practices to crime scene evidence became the norm.92 The
question that immediately arises is: How is it that when confronted with
scientific evidence raising questions about the commonsensical
application and interpretation of forensic practices that are
continuously found to be faulty fails to dislodge the prevailing belief?
This is a question that I will take up in detail in the sections that
follow. But consistent with my point above, I wonder aloud whether the
persistent disregard of each of the four Daubert criteria by gate
keeping judges speaks to magical thinking in the service of state
efforts to maintain social control through the administration of justice
with primacy given to satisficing. If so, by what mechanisms might this
be accomplished? Unscientific Forensic Practices Other scholars far more
qualified than I have thoughtfully critiqued the substantive conceptual,
procedural, technological, and testimonial aspects of each of the
currently applied forensic practices.93 In particular I draw attention
to the careful assessment of contemporary expert testimony as applied to
match and pattern evidence revealed in the work of Mnookin et al.94
Generally, Mnookin et al. engage in critique of contemporary forensic
practices that presumes the same overarching concern that I raise here,
but with specific conceptualization of what they refer to as a "research
culture."95 In order to establish the validity and reliability of
contemporary match and pattern evidence, Mnookin et al. propose the
creation of "a culture in which the question of the relationship between
research-based knowledge and laboratory practices is both foregrounded
and central."96 Among the questions identified by Mnookin et al. are:
What do we know? How do we know that? How sure are we about that? ... We
mean a \[research\] culture in which these questions are answered by
reference to data, to published studies, and to publicly accessible
materials, rather than reference to experience or craft knowledge, or
simply assumed to be true because they have long been assumed to be
true.97 According to the Federal Rule of Evidence 702 (b), expert
witness testimony may be introduced at trial so long as "the expert's
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the
trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in
issue."98 But what is the criteria for determining the credibility of
the evidence and testimony proffered by those expert witnesses? For
example, under Rule 702 should the following forensic testimony be
permitted at trial: fingerprint friction ridge analysis, pattern
evidence like shoeprints and tire tracks, tool marks and firearms
identification, hair microscopy, fiber evidence, document examination,
paint and coatings evidence, explosives and fire, odontology, or
bloodstain pattern analysis? Each of these forensic practices was
assessed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in its 2010 report
called Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path
Forward. 99 In each case the most common forensic practices employed by
law enforcement had violated all but one of the core criteria
articulated by the Court in Daubert. (Courts typically apply the fifth
of the Daubert criteria, a holdover from Frye that emphasizes general
acceptance.100) Assuming for the moment the accuracy of the NAS report
indicating that none of the forensic practices, with the exception of
DNA (both nuclear and mitochondrial) and toxicology, meet scientific
standards for validity and reliability, should they be used to
individualize suspicion leading to arrest and prosecution? Among the key
questions presented in the report are whether: (a) any forensic practice
is informed by science, (b) the testing methods and conclusions are
reliable, (c) the labs are competent, and (d) the examiners are
proficient. The following citation to the report is indicative of the
serious concerns raised: With the exception of nuclear DNA analysis...
no forensic method has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to
consistently, and with a high degree of certainty, demonstrate a
connection between evidence and a specific individual or source.101 The
NAS report was followed in 2016 with publication of the President's
Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) Report pertaining
to Forensic Science in Criminal Courts.102 Two significant gaps between
forensic science and the legal system were acknowledged in that report:
(1) the need for clarity about the scientific standards for the validity
and reliability of forensic methods, and (2) the need to evaluate
specific forensic methods to determine whether they have been
scientifically established to be valid and reliable. To conduct its
assessment, the PCAST Committee reviewed more than 2,000 published
scholarly papers. Unlike Rule 702, which equivocates on the question of
whether "experience" should be enough to permit expert testimony,103 the
PCAST Committee raised concerns over what it terms "black box" research
-- forensic assessments that focus upon inputs and outputs rather than
the methods used to generate them (the definition of consequentialism).
Black box forensic practices are typically based upon the experience of
the examiner rather than application of scientific method. This kind of
testimony, which would accommodate the "general acceptance" rule in Frye
and the fifth criteria of Daubert, is scientifically meaningless. In
fact, the PCAST Report concludes by saying that: "Neither experience,
nor judgment, nor good professional practices (e.g., certification
programs, proficiency testing, codes of ethics) can substitute for
actual evidence of foundational validity and reliability." But should
that matter? In a 1993 civil lawsuit brought against Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,104 the United States Supreme Court articulated a
standard of expert testimony principally constituted by scientific
standards of validity and reliability and articulated as part of the
Federal Rules of Evidence 702. As of 2017 the Daubert standard has been
adopted by thirty-nine states,105 with three states providing a mixed
evidentiary model,106 and eight states adhering to the 1923 Frye
standard.107 The intention of the Court in Daubert was to provide a
gatekeeping role for judges108 in order to enhance the certainty
regarding correlations between suspects and forensic evidence. Writing
in concurrence, Justice Scalia makes it clear that the Court will expect
judges to take their gatekeeping responsibility seriously

#### Neg humanitarian, individualizing, rights-centric discourse reifies the disciplinary state

Ancel was an heir to the "social defense" movement born in 19th-century
Europe. It focused on crime prevention by drawing on expertise to assess
offenders' dangerousness and incapacitate them as needed (Gerber and
McAnany, 1972). But Ancel advocated a "[new social defense]{.underline}"
because he placed greater emphasis on rehabilitation and
[envisioned]{.underline} "the defense of human rights, the protection of
the human being and therefore the passionate search for a criminal
justice policy of a humanistic kind, in the strongest sense of the word
\[humaniste\]" (1981: 7). "New social defense" may thus be a misnomer
because Ancel's theory truly was "[[penal humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Sizaire, 2017: 263). Ancel's perspective did not arise ex nihilo. He
credited Renaissance and Enlightenment humanism as a source of his new
social defense theory (1981: 51--56). European penal systems rooted in
religious traditionalism and absolute monarchy gradually came to be
replaced by liberal and secular principles. In the 19th and early 20th
centuries, this initially gave way to "neo-classical doctrines" with a
technical, positivist focus on the application of the law to an offense.
[Deploring an "excess" of "legalism", Ancel]{.underline} (1981: 72,
203--204, 312) [[faulted]{.mark} these [doctrines for]{.mark}
[disregarding]{.mark} "[the]{.mark} human [person" by treating offenders
as "objects" instead of "subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}". Yet the
Enlightenment did not simply foster legalism, but also a shift toward
more humane punishments, as demonstrated by the rise of
anti-death-penalty movements in Europe and North America (Jouet,
forthcoming 2022). Insofar as these shifts marked emerging sensibilities
against harshness, as Durkheim (1900) and many argued, Ancel was among
the actors hoping to carry this movement into modernity. [In Ancel's
eyes]{.underline}, [[the individual must be at the **heart** of criminal
justice]{.mark}.]{.underline} He differentiated his theory from "dogma"
like positivism deterministically imputing crime to biological traits
(1981: 77). Emphasizing "free will", Ancel was even skeptical about
classifying "habitual offenders, occasional offenders, and passionate
offenders". "Research on these classifications is probably legitimate
and useful scientifically", he wrote, "but, for the new social defense,
the act is above all the expression of an individual personality in a
given situation" (1981: 186). Ancel's reification of individualism
reflected wider social shifts. A parallel is palpable between the
historic shift toward individualized punishment with humane aspirations
and the societal shift that saw the individual gain importance in
19th-century intellectual life. For instance, Søren Kierkegaard blamed
Hegel for painting a rigid and systematic vision of history ignoring
individual agency. According to Kierkegaard (1846: 121), Hegel even
forgot he was a human being. Whether justified or not,6 this accusation
mirrored [Ancel's]{.underline} (1981: 184) [claim that criminal law in
the 19th and early 20th centuries had come "to forget that the offender
is a man]{.underline}". While it may seem like existentialist philosophy
and humanistic penal reform belong to distinct universes, in the history
of ideas they lend themselves to analogies given their defense of the
individual's worth. Just as the penal system should not be a machinery
judging individuals without assessing their circumstances, history
should not be perceived as a colossal mechanism rendering individual
choice meaningless. Such individualistic claims enable us to analogize
[[Ancel's concerns to]{.mark} those of]{.underline} existentialists like
Søren **[[Kierkegaard]{.underline}]{.mark}** or Jean-Paul
**[[Sartre]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as well as]{.underline}]{.mark}
Albert **[[Camus]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who distanced himself from
existentialism despite sharing aspects of its outlook (Camus, 1946). In
fact, [Ancel]{.underline} (1981: 287--288) approvingly cited Camus's
essay The Rebel (1951) when [call]{.underline}ing [for "a new
conscience" of the "value of human life]{.underline}". Camus's influence
in Ancel's epoch is corroborated by Reflections on the Guillotine
(1957), an impactful anti-death-penalty essay. In addition to citing
Ancel, Anthony Amsterdam, the prominent American abolitionist,
emphatically cited Camus's essay when challenging the death penalty as a
"cruel and unusual", substantively inhumane punishment before the US
Supreme Court in 1972 (Amsterdam, 1972). Law & Literature is often
understood as a field exploring literary themes in the law and vice
versa (Stern, 2014), yet literature also offers a window into the
genealogy of ideas that have influenced criminal law and its actors.
Figures like Camus and Amsterdam further exemplify how [[Ancel belonged
to]{.mark} a wider reform movement with [humanistic]{.mark}
aspirations]{.underline}, [which stemmed partly from [Enlightenment
ideals]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jouet, forthcoming 2022). At first glance,
the radical critique that Michel **[[Foucault]{.underline}]{.mark}**
offered in Discipline and Punish's [[repudiated]{.mark} this movement by
painting [Enlightenment humanism as an **insidious** means of
**legitimizing** penal control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Upon closer
scrutiny, however, we will see in subsequent sections below that
Foucault converged with this humanistic reform movement in light of the
positions he took as an activist, which could diverge from his theories.
Still, Ancel's outlook appeared more hopeful than the pessimism, if not
nihilism (Maier-Katkin, 2003), perceptible in Foucault's writings. But
Ancel's conception of progress was not synonymous with a naive or
utopian aspiration to create a crimeless society. His idealism was
counterbalanced with a lucidity evoking Camus's Myth of Sisyphus
(1942a), which called for accepting the disappointing realities of an
"absurd" world in order to pragmatically face them. Tellingly, Ancel
(1981: 287) referred to an "absurd . . . human condition" when citing
Camus's The Rebel. Ancel depicted crime as "a human fact" and "social
problem" that a reductive "legal machinery" cannot comprehend. Mere
retribution would likewise be blind. The new social defense "does not
have the goal of instituting an absolute justice, exactly proportional
to the abstract evil perpetrated or intended" (1981: 182, emphasis in
original). Ancel deemed that lex talionis reflected a senseless
metaphysical morality aiming to equate the sentence precisely with the
crime. He further underlined that deviant behavior is inevitable and
that the public "should recognize and accept" this (1981: 182, 184,
267). Ancel's humanism thus went hand in hand with pragmatism. Even
though individualistic and humanistic conceptions of justice
materialized several centuries earlier (Garland, 1990), Ancel emphasized
their development after the Second World War. The first international
congress of social defense occurred in San Remo in 1947, soon followed
by the creation of the International Society of Social Defence and a UN
social defense section. The Council of Europe kept on this track (Ancel,
1981: 15, 32, 258). The movement's opponents "feared that sociologists,
criminologists, and psychiatrists would usurp the role of judges and
place their sciences over the rule of law", as Patricia O'Brien (1998:
196) observed. Ultimately, "Social Defense stood as a marker of the
general postwar emphasis on individual treatment and social protection"
(1998: 196). Ancel became a leading figure of this movement aspiring to
a "socio-humanistic" criminal justice policy protecting "human dignity"
(1981: 34). Channeling the polyvalence of Enlightenment thought, he
wanted criminal law to embrace "all the sciences of man" (1981: 36).
Multidisciplinarity should outstrip narrow legalism: "The criminalist
feels today that he cannot be simply a jurist" (1981: 18). His holism
comprised a profound internationalism and comparatism. Because dignity
is a norm rooted in the intrinsic worth of each human being in the
abstract (Bioy, 2010; Cassia, 2016; Kateb, 2011), an aspiration toward
"universalism" naturally was at the heart of Ancel's vision (1981: 36).
Ancel's optimism toward the evolution of Western criminal justice had
not anticipated developments like intensifying tensions over systemic
racism. Nor had Ancel foreseen modern dimensions of American
exceptionalism, including the rise of mass incarceration in the United
States since the 1980s (Jouet, 2017). To the contrary, when the last
edition of La Défense sociale nouvelle appeared in 1981, Ancel (1981:
125) was convinced that jurists face "human and social problems that, in
the current state of \[Western\] civilization, tend to arise everywhere
nearly in the same manner". Ancel seems to have further underestimated
the indifference, ambivalence or hostility toward international
standards among numerous American officials and citizens (Ignatieff,
2005; Jouet, 2017). If Ancel did not anticipate these modern
developments, he was keenly aware that rehabilitation was already under
attack in his lifetime (Dreyfus, 2010). The sustained challenge did not
solely come from conservatives who accused his humanistic model of naive
leniency toward criminals. The attack equally came from the left and was
largely spearheaded by Michel Foucault. From Ancel's pragmatic optimism
to Foucault's pragmatic pessimism Foucault's growing focus on criminal
punishment in the 1970s with The Punitive Society lectures (1972--1973)
and Discipline and Punish (1975) may be interpreted as the culmination
of a radical leftist critique of penality that gained ground in the
1960s (Garland, 2002: 65--67). This section describes how Foucauldian
theory's visceral pessimism challenged the influential, optimistic
outlook that Ancel had offered in La Défense sociale nouvelle.
Discipline and Punish was released in 1975, after the first (1954) and
second edition (1966) of Ancel's book. By the third edition (1981),
Ancel was mindful that Foucault and fellow iconoclasts had undercut his
theories. Ancel (1981: 260) consequently defended himself against a
"[[critical criminology]{.mark}" [equating prisoner rehabilitation with
"oppression and subjugation]{.mark}]{.underline}". Among these stood
"labeling theory" and its view that crime is just a social construct:
"\[[T\]he offender is only an offender because he is deemed so through a
labeling]{.underline} process" (1981: 118). "Radical criminology"
likewise gained traction in the United States during the 1960s civil
rights and antiwar movements, leading to the idea that "[the criminal
act is essentially a refusal of the social order established by the
ruling classes]{.underline}" (1981: 118--119). Most importantly, Ancel
(1981: 260) added that these critics "find themselves in agreement with
Mr. Foucault to conclude that, [after the subjugation of the body under
the ancient system, [the]{.mark} supposedly [reformed]{.mark} [system
oversees the subjugation of the soul]{.mark}]{.underline}". Seeking to
rebut Foucault's influential theory, Ancel (1981: 117) mentions him when
stressing "the influence of an ideology derived from Marxism" permeating
critiques of criminal justice. To Ancel (1981: 328--329), Foucault's
views reflected: ideological assumptions according to which it is
possible to build, instead of the present (capitalist) society, a
society where men, free and equal, could behave in a spontaneous manner,
which would make disappear at the same time marginalization, deviance,
and criminality. Ancel suggested that the critics' priority then becomes
to "stand against 'the ideology of rehabilitation'" (1981: 328--329). By
the late 1970s, [Foucault's followers had actually begun challenging
Ancel's theories on these grounds]{.underline} (Dreyfus, 2010: 185--188,
192). Discipline and Punish had certainly repudiated Ancel's prominent
theory, albeit between the lines, as Foucault did not cite Ancel. In
Foucault's eyes, [penality had not evolved toward greater humanity since
the Enlightenment. At most the change was cosmetic, a ruse to hide a
sophisticated apparatus of repression under which the lower classes were
purportedly incarcerated for their own good in the name of illusory
rehabilitation]{.underline}. Changing social conditions no longer
tolerated flagrant corporal punishment like the agony inflicted on the
regicide Damiens in 1757, with which Foucault memorably begins
Discipline and Punish. [Hence, [the ruling classes strategized]{.mark}
more insidious means of [control]{.mark} with the birth of modern
prisons and their depersonalized, routinized, and regimented ways of
overseeing the lower classes [in a]{.mark}n allegedly [benevolent,
humanistic spirit]{.mark}]{.underline}. The evolution toward
individualized punishment, which Ancel celebrated, represented to
Foucault a new technology of power. Psychiatrists, psychologists, and
other experts would strategically evaluate the character of those thrust
into the penal machinery. Foucault was not alone in expressing such
concerns. In The Stranger, Camus (1942b) notably painted a law less
focused on the crime than the criminal's character. The defense counsel
of Meursault, the antihero who committed murder days after his mother's
funeral, reveals his exasperation: "Come now, is my client on trial for
\[coldly\] burying his mother or for killing a man?" The prosecutor
replies that: only someone with the naiveté of his esteemed colleague
could fail to appreciate that between these two sets of facts existed a
profound, fundamental, and tragic relationship. "Indeed," he loudly
exclaimed, "I accuse this man of burying his mother with crime in his
heart!" (1942b: 96) [If the humanist Camus depicted criminal law as an
intrusive and repressive apparatus, Foucault was far more iconoclastic
in Discipline and Punish, casting humanism as nothing more than a means
of legitimizing power]{.underline}. [The psychological or psychiatric
evaluation of prisoners helps us tie Discipline and Punish to Foucault's
wider corpus]{.underline}. As Bernard Harcourt (2020: 113) notes, [the
prison "produces a truth about the delinquent]{.underline}", offering a
parallel with Foucault's Louvain lectures (1981c) on how the medieval
religious practice of extracting avowals from wrongdoers influenced
penality. To Foucault, [the development of [modern individualism]{.mark}
discussed above [was not synonymous with growing liberty, but with the
state's domination of the individual]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ferry and
Renaut, 1985). Critics found he depicted "a kind of Whig history in
reverse---a history, in spite of itself, of The Rise of Unfreedom"
(Geertz, 1978). Diverse thinkers have comparably equated the idea of
progress since the Enlightenment with a discours de légitimation---a
rhetoric aiming to rationalize social injustice. Echoing the incredulity
of contemporary French intellectuals toward such metanarratives
(Lyotard, 1979; Sartre, 1965), [Foucault]{.underline} became the key
philosopher of skepticism toward progress in the penal sphere. As such,
Discipline and Punish implicitly [dismissed]{.underline} Ancel and
explicitly dismissed Émile Durkheim, who had authored another leading
theory on [the]{.underline} gradual [humanization of
punishment]{.underline} (Durkheim, 1900; Foucault, 1975: 23). Ancel's
aforementioned critique of Foucault was therefore not disinterested. In
the third edition of La Défense sociale nouvelle he sought to respond to
diverse critics, some of whom accused him of "communism" for being
excessively liberal, whereas others equated him with "American
capitalism" for being insufficiently radical (1981: 304). After all,
Ancel wrote during the Cold War in a climate where many expected
thinkers to pick a side. Ancel evoked this context when suggesting that
Foucault was on the far-left of the political spectrum and that his
philosophy had Marxist roots (1981: 117, 328--329). Foucault's words
after visiting Attica, the infamous American prison, tended to exemplify
Ancel's observation. Foucault had then insisted that "the problem is,
then, to find out what role capitalism has its penal system play",
including "in the class struggle". He added that the distinction between
ordinary and political prisoners was illusory (1972c: 28, 31--32). In
fact, the detention of Maoist comrades had drawn Foucault toward
prisoners' rights in France and led him to become a founder of the
Groupe d'information des prisons, an activist group discussed below,
before crafting Discipline and Punish (Miller, 1993).

several ribs were broken. [He's home now, bruised, bandaged---and still
terrified]{.underline}. He asked why the police hadn't acted. [He had to
call the police after the assault. He had to send them photos of his
broken bones. The crime is a felony, but the police have no
leads]{.underline}. I told my neighbor that this is too familiar in my
field of work. [[When you are a victim, **you become
everything**]{.mark}: [The survivor, the patient, the detective, the
crime scene investigator, the narrator]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The police
asked him, why didn't you have a camera? Why didn't you let your dog
out? Classic **victim blaming**]{.underline}. Eventually, [when he had
to identify possible suspects, he was stressed: Could he recognize his
attacker? Filing a civil restraining order was impossible because the
police had not yet investigated the incident---or identified a
suspect]{.underline}. Welcome to my work, I said. Welcome to my world.
**[[It is exhausting]{.mark} to be a victim]{.underline}**. [[Having to
fight]{.mark} [for your own survival]{.mark} is a tale as old as
time]{.underline}. I hear it every day, and not just at work. My
neighbor's story is far from unique. A teenager I know was the victim of
a fight at school; her parents pushed the school for accommodations
after the school did nothing. When I was in college, a friend was
assaulted by her doctor. Years later, the burden to testify, to come
forward, to try to stop him, was hers. Another friend suffered a beating
outside of his place of employment. He had to track down security camera
footage just to get the police to pay attention. I know because I have
practiced [[domestic violence]{.mark} law]{.underline} since 2004. Over
the decades, [[the]{.mark} [story is the same]{.mark}, always [what the
victim could]{.mark} or should [have done]{.mark}
[differently]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Victim-blaming]{.mark}** in the
public sphere [is brutal]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Imagine when it happens
at home. [By your loved ones]{.mark}. Or by those who claim to love you.
The blaming **magnifies**.]{.underline} "[Why didn't you speak
up]{.underline}?" They ask. "[Why didn't you tell anyone? Why did you
marry that person?" Why why why.]{.underline} A big part of [our work is
teaching survivors that [the system is not fair. In the pursuit of
justice, the system can **hurt you more**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Even in
a crisis, you have to be your own advocate.]{.underline} Plenty of
information intended for people who experience domestic violence was
applicable to my neighbor's situation. I shared all the information I
had on victim restitution, relocation assistance, security cameras, how
to advocate with [[law enforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}, how to file a
restraining order, and more. As helpful as the information might be, it
[[forced him to take]{.mark} the [time]{.mark} that he should have [used
for healing]{.mark} from the physical and emotional damage [to
become]{.mark} [his own advocate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even my offer
rang hollow because all [my]{.underline} well-intentioned [advice
shifted the burden from the authorities to my neighbor, the
victim]{.underline}. I am proud to lead an organization that puts
survivors first---but even [I unintentionally burdened a victim, who
should have been supported during a difficult time.]{.underline} We can
and must remove barriers to accessing justice. During President Trump's
first administration, the failure to pursue white-collar crimes and cuts
in the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and related government funding had a
massive impact on victims of crime, who now find it much more difficult
to get access to legal aid. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) did not pass
the committee last session. We have another opportunity now to secure
much-needed funding for victims of crime. Call or email your
representatives now and urge them to pass this vital legislation. A
similar law was enacted in California in 2024 to address the reduction
in federal funding. It came into effect after a group of advocates urged
their legislators to find funding to continue critical services---like
keeping shelters and other related services for survivors running. Other
states can use a similar model in the meantime. Congress must enact this
law to continue to protect survivors. On February 7, 2025, the Office on
Violence Against Women, withdrew funding opportunities that had
previously been available \-- sustaining the toxic trend of blaming the
victim.

Prison reform extends the power of the prison Foucault's argument that
[prison reform]{.underline} [merely extends the power of]{.underline}
[the prison]{.underline} has also been central to prison abolition
activism. Davis (2004) reiterates Foucault's point when she observes
that [[there is a]{.mark} 'seemingly [**unbreakable** link between
prison reform and prison]{.mark} [development']{.mark} which 'has
created a situation in which progress in [prison]{.mark}
[reform]{.mark}]{.underline} has tended to [[render the prison **more
impermeable** to]{.underline} [change]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[result]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
[[in]{.underline} [bigger]{.underline}]{.mark}, and what are considered
"[better", [prisons']{.mark}]{.underline} (Davis and Rodriguez, 2004).
Two examples will be discussed here. Nineteenth-century women reformers
protested the incarceration of women in the same brutal institutions as
men and their activism resulted in the construction of separate prisons
for women (Smith, 2010: 266). However, in these new institutions women
were often incarcerated for longer than they had been in men's prisons
and [the construction of special institutions for women enabled the
incarceration of more women than before.]{.underline} [[Feminist prison
reform]{.mark} again [led to a growth in women's
incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline} in the late 20th century in Canada.
Until the 1990s, the situation of federally sentenced women in Canada
was the subject of frequent political critique. There existed only one
prison for such women in the country -- the infamous Prison for Women in
Kingston -- which meant that most federally sentenced women were
incarcerated far from their communities in an institution deemed 'unfit
for bears, much less women' (Hayman, 2006: 19). [Feminist prison reforms
resulted in the building of numerous new prisons for women across the
country]{.underline}: prisons whose design was informed by consultations
with members of the Elizabeth Fry Society and Indigenous people,
including formerly incarcerated Indigenous women. [These prisons were
built with the genuine intention of [empowering]{.mark} women prisoners
as well as to situate them closer to their families]{.underline}, and
even included a 'Healing Lodge' for Indigenous women prisoners. The new
prisons were initially characterized by cottagestyle housing, an absence
of conspicuous fencing and bars, and female staff who were trained to be
closer to therapists and friends than correctional officers. However, in
a matter of years, [the new [prisons]{.mark} [reverted to the
carceral]{.mark} models, [logics]{.mark} and practices [of the]{.mark}
[institution they]{.mark} had [replaced]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
result, Canada now has vastly more beds for federally sentenced women
than before, which it has been quick to fill (Hannah-Moffat and Shaw,
2000; Hayman, 2006; Montford, 2015). Turning to a second example,
[[legislation aimed at]{.mark} [addressing]{.mark} the problem of
[prison rape]{.mark}]{.underline} in the US [[resulted
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act
([PREA]{.underline}). [This Act has provided prisoners with [little
protection from rape]{.mark}]{.underline} and few legal resources in the
aftermath of rape, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} has [resulted]{.underline}
[in [more]{.mark} intense conditions of]{.underline} confinement
(**[[solitary confinement]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} those whom [guards deem at risk of sexual
assault (often [LGBTQ]{.mark} inmates) [or]{.mark} of committing sexual
assault (often [racialized prisoners]{.mark}]{.underline}[)]{.mark}
(Arkles, 2014, 2015). [[The PREA]{.underline}]{.mark} has also [[led to
extensions of prison sentences]{.mark} for those whom guards deem guilty
of sexual misconduct, although this [misconduct often involves
consensual sexual contact]{.mark}]{.underline} between prisoners [[or
transgressive gender expression]{.underline}]{.mark} (Arkles, 2014,
2015). [LGBTQ prisoners are at particular risk of receiving PREA
violations for consensual sexual activities]{.underline}. There is no
indication that the PREA has reduced incidents of sexual assault, but
there is considerable evidence that it has been used by prison staff to
increase control of sexual and gender expression in prisons. [The PREA
has earmarked no money for survivors of sexual violence, yet millions of
PREA dollars have flowed into funding 'personnel, training, technical
assistance, data collection, and equipment to prevent and prosecute
prisoner rape']{.underline} (Arkles, 2015: 105). As Jason Lydon (2016:
64) writes: 'This well-intentioned [[reform]{.mark} effort]{.underline}
[by progressives has been [turned into a tool of increased control
of]{.mark} sex and [sexuality]{.mark} in prison]{.underline} with little
evidence that any of the PREA mandates actually reduce incidents of
sexual harm.' Because, as in these examples, prison reform consistently
serves to expand and reinforce the power and logics of the carceral
state, Gilmore (2015) has argued that [[the only kinds of]{.mark}
[reforms]{.mark} that prison abolitionists should strive for [are
'non-reformist]{.mark} [reforms']{.mark}]{.underline}. These are reforms
[[that address]{.mark} the abuses of [the prison without]{.mark}
[allocating]{.mark} any [new funds]{.mark}, [resources or personnel to
prisons]{.mark} and without building any new institutions]{.underline}.
Examples of nonreformist reforms are decriminalizing sex work and drug
possession; getting better food, a mail service, weekend passes and
conjugal visits for prisoners, and compassionate release for ill,
elderly and dying prisoners. None of these measures abolishes or even
fundamentally challenges the prison, but they either reduce its use or
improve the welfare of those who are currently in prisons without
extending carceral power or logics. [By engaging only in nonreformist
reforms, activists strive to help some people avoid prison and to
improve the conditions of those who are currently in prisons without
reinforcing an institution that]{.underline}, ultimately, [they hope to
eliminate]{.underline}. Abolishing prisons alone is ineffective

"Punishment Without Trial: Why Plea Bargaining Is a Bad Deal," Abrams
Press, ISBN: 9781419750304\]/Kankee

Like José, Jerome had been arrested. Neither José nor Jerome had been
found guilty of committing a crime. Yet they were being held in jail
along with people who had already been convicted and were serving their
sentences. For José, the prosecutor was offering a plea bargain where
the court would recognize that the time José had already spent in jail
was punishment enough for what he had done. These sorts of sentences are
so common that they have a nickname: "time served." Prosecutors were not
offering Jerome a plea to time served; the crime he was accused of was
too serious. But if Jerome had been found guilty at trial, the time he
spent in jail before the trial would have been subtracted from any
prison sentence that he received. This is also a common sentencing
practice called "credit for time served." As these common practices
recognize, the government had already begun to punish José and Jerome
even though they hadn't been convicted. It is hard to understand why we
allow the government to keep people in jail when they haven't been
convicted of a crime. After all, Jerome's case teaches us that at least
some of the people in jail are innocent. If the state hadn't dismissed
the charges against him, Jerome would have been acquitted at trial.
That's why we have trials: to sort out who is guilty and who is not. And
before that trial happens or before a person pleads guilty, we have to
assume that they are innocent. Lawyers call this idea the "presumption
of innocence." It is the same idea behind the common expression
"innocent until proven guilty." So why do we allow the state to punish
an innocent man like Jerome? [Why do we let them keep José in jail
before proving that he is guilty]{.underline}? [Why do [we]{.mark} let
them [punish]{.mark} the hundreds of [thousands]{.mark} of people [who
sit in jail]{.mark} every year [and]{.mark} who [haven't]{.mark} yet
[been convicted]{.mark}]{.underline}? Well, [the]{.underline} people in
[criminal justice system]{.underline} don't say that they are punishing
people before trial. They [say that they are merely detaining these
people, not punishing them]{.underline}. But that seems like little more
than wordplay: [people]{.underline} like José and Jerome [are being
treated **no differently** than the people in jail who have been
convicted]{.underline}. That's why, [if they are actually convicted,
their sentencing judges will say that the time they spent in jail counts
as punishment]{.underline}. Of course, the time a person spends sitting
in jail doesn't magically transform into punishment just because she is
later convicted. Yet that's what judges say [the law]{.underline} does:
they [say sitting in jail isn't punishment before someone is convicted;
it isn't punishment if the charges are dropped or the person is
acquitted]{.underline}; [but it retroactively becomes punishment if the
person pleads guilty or is convicted at trial]{.underline}. Why do we
let our government officials use wordplay and legal fictions to punish
people before they have been proven guilty? And how could this happen in
a country where we say that everyone is innocent until proven guilty?
The truth is that we didn't used to let the government detain so many
people before trial. [When our constitution was written]{.underline},
[the assumption was that someone like José, who was accused of a minor
crime, could not have been detained before trial]{.underline}. And for
the first century after the Constitution was adopted, someone like
Jerome also would have been released. Because Jerome's crime was more
serious, a judge probably would have required him or someone close to
him to provide a financial guarantee that Jerome would show up in court
for his trial. For example, Jerome might have had to pledge the deed to
his house, which would have been forfeited to the court if he had failed
to show up for trial. Or if Jerome didn't own a house, then a wealthier
relative would have had to agree to forfeit some property or money if
Jerome didn't show. But unless there was some reason to believe that
Jerome would not come back to court, the judge could not have just
refused to let Jerome out of jail before his trial. José's case was so
minor that he probably would not even have been arrested. And even if he
had been arrested, he would have been released as a matter of course.
[He certainly would not have had to plea bargain with the prosecution in
order to get out of jail]{.underline}. To be clear, there were
exceptions to the rule that people had to be released. People who were
charged with capital crimes were denied the right to bail. The theory
was that a person facing the possibility of the death penalty was more
likely to run away; they would run because losing their property or the
property of their friends and family is better than the risk of being
executed. Historically, a number of crimes---not just murder---were
capital crimes. But until the middle of the twentieth century, making
someone stay in jail until her trial was still the exception rather than
the rule. The right to be released from custody and remain free before
trial was considered an important right by the people who wrote our
constitution. They were familiar with what happened in England, where
people had to fight to make sure that prisoners could be released. [That
right not to be detained before trial was included in the **Magna
Carta**]{.underline}, and Parliament passed a famous law to stop court
officials from setting the financial guarantees so high that people
couldn't meet them. To avoid these problems and abuses in America,
[Congress passed a law when it first met in 1789 that ensured all
defendants were entitled to release pretrial except for those facing the
death penalty]{.underline}. Two years later, [when the **Bill of
Rights** was adopted, it included the directive that "**excessive bail
shall not be required**]{.underline}." The right of defendants to be
released before trial grew weaker in the mid-twentieth century. In the
1940s the federal criminal justice system adopted a series of procedural
rules. Those rules did not frame the question of pretrial release just
in terms of whether the defendant was likely to appear at trial.
Instead, the rule told judges to consider the crime the defendant was
charged with, the strength of the evidence against him, the defendant's
financial situation, and his character in setting the financial
guarantee. These new factors didn't make sense in a system that presumed
everyone innocent until proven guilty. At the same time, judges started
setting high bail amounts that people couldn't possibly pay, presumably
because the judges didn't want to release the people at all. Congress
intervened in 1966. It passed a law trying to make sure that judges
didn't set bail amounts too high and that judges didn't use pretrial
detention to keep defendants from committing new crimes while awaiting
trial. But the 1966 law also validated the criminal procedure rules,
telling judges to consider what crimes defendants were accused of
committing and to weigh the evidence against them when setting the
conditions of release on bail. The 1966 law also gave judges the
authority to deny bail altogether in noncapital cases if they decided
that the defendants were unlikely to appear for future court dates.
Although it endorsed the idea that judges should weigh evidence and
could deny bail even in noncapital cases, all told, the 1966 law still
favored releasing defendants before trial. That changed in the 1980s. In
1984, Congress passed a new bail law that told judges to consider
whether it was safe to release a defendant before trial. If the judge
thought that a defendant posed a danger to the community, then the judge
was instructed to keep the defendant in jail rather than set any
conditions for bail. The law also said that judges should assume
defendants accused of many different types of noncapital crimes could
not be safely released pending trial. This flipped the presumption of
innocence on its head by presuming that a person accused of a crime
should be detained and shifting the burden to justify release onto the
defendant. This new bail law was part of a larger set of federal laws
aimed at cracking down on crime, which had surged in the 1960s and
1970s. Importantly, the Supreme Court signed off on these new bail laws
and validated using bail to restore "law and order." It decided that the
Constitution's rule against excessive bail didn't prevent the courts
from refusing to set any bail whatsoever and just keep defendants in
jail before trial. And it also blessed Congress's decision to make
"dangerousness" part of the bail decision. In short, the justices
allowed the government to dramatically change the balance of power
before trial. [Prosecutors could keep defendants in jail for extended
periods of time without having to convince juries of
anything]{.underline}; [all they had to do was convince the judge that
the defendants probably committed the crimes or that they were likely to
commit more crimes]{.underline} if they were released back into their
communities while awaiting trial. [The]{.underline} people who wrote the
[Constitution expected]{.underline} that [most people accused of a crime
would be set free rather than held in jail pending trial]{.underline}.
But two hundred years later Congress and the [courts]{.underline}
[had]{.underline} largely **[abandoned]{.underline}** [the view of
pretrial detention as an exception rather than the rule]{.underline}.
[[Jail was **presumed**]{.mark} for a lot of crimes]{.underline}, and
[[judges]{.mark} were explicitly invited to [**short- circuit** the
presumption of]{.mark} [innocence]{.mark} and weigh evidence
themselves]{.underline}. Then---remarkably---things got even worse. In
recent decades more and more people have been held in jail before being
convicted. This increase in pretrial detention has a few different
causes. First, more people are getting brought to jail in the first
place. [In 1984]{.underline}, the year that Congress passed its second
bail reform law, just over **[50 percent]{.underline}** [of all arrests
ended in someone being brought to jail]{.underline}. [Everyone else
was]{.underline} simply [given a summons to appear in court and remained
free until that date]{.underline}. [By 2012, [**95** percent of arrests
result]{.mark}ed [in]{.mark} the suspect being brought to
[jail]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those numbers are remarkable not only
because of the large increase but also because [crime rates dropped
significantly from 1984 to 2012]{.underline}. [Even though there was
less crime, police brought more people to jail]{.underline}. Another
reason that pretrial detention has increased is because [it is now more
difficult for people to get out of jail while waiting for
trial]{.underline}. [In 1990, only one-half of defendants had to provide
a financial guarantee]{.underline} to be released from jail. The rest
were "released on their own recognizance"---that is, the courts trusted
them to come back without having to give a financial guarantee. [By
2004, nearly **[two-thirds]{.mark}** of defendants [were required to
provide a]{.mark} financial [guarantee]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Bail
amounts]{.underline} have also [increased]{.underline}. [From 1990 to
2004, the [average]{.mark} amount of [bail]{.mark} in a felony case
[increased]{.mark} more than **[40 percent]{.mark}**---from \$38,000 to
\$55,400]{.underline}. Even [misdemeanor]{.underline}
[defendants]{.underline} [are]{.underline} sometimes [required to pay
bail amounts of up to **\$20,000** to be released before
trial]{.underline}. The result of these changes has been devastating.
[Nearly **[half a million]{.mark}** people [sit in jail]{.mark} every
day in the United States [because they cannot make
bail]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many of [those cases involve poor people
accused of misdemeanor crimes who simply do not have the financial
resources to pay even relatively modest financial
guarantees]{.underline}. In New York City, one study found that more
than **[[80 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of defendants charged with
low-level crimes [were unable to make]{.mark} bail that was set at less
than \$**[500]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Those people---[[people]{.mark}
who were presumed innocent and accused only of a minor
crime---[were]{.mark} **[stuck in jail]{.mark}** [because]{.mark} [they
were poor]{.mark}]{.underline}. \* \* \* \* \* It might not seem like a
bad idea to keep people who have committed crimes or people who are
likely to commit crimes in jail. After all, people should be punished
when they commit crimes, and one reason to punish them is to keep the
rest of us safe. But even it if is a good idea to keep some people in
jail before trial, our system is very unfair in how it decides who stays
in jail and who is let out. The decisions are made quickly---sometimes
without a defense lawyer and sometimes without a real judge. And
[we]{.underline} also [treat rich people and poor people differently,
allowing rich people to buy their release and forcing poor people to
stay in jail]{.underline}. It's hard to say that what happens at bail
hearings qualifies as "due process of law," which the Constitution
guarantees before anyone is deprived of their liberty. It's also hard to
say that rich and poor people are getting the "equal protection of the
laws," which the Constitution also guarantees. Because of this, legal
advocacy groups have been challenging bail practices across the country.
One of those groups---Civil Rights Corps, an organization devoted to
challenging systemic injustice in the American legal system---had a big
win in Houston, Texas. \* \* \* \* \* In March of 2016, Elizabeth Rossi
traveled to Houston. She went to the Harris County Criminal Justice
Center, a large building in downtown Houston that houses much of the
county's criminal justice system. She entered the building, went through
the metal detector, and asked for directions to the courtroom where bail
hearings take place. It wasn't at all obvious where the courtroom
was---she had to walk through people's offices to get there---but
eventually she found it and took a seat in the back of the courtroom. At
the front of the courtroom was a hearing officer---not a judge, but a
person who had been selected by the judges in the county---a prosecutor,
and a representative from pretrial services, the agency responsible for
helping the courts with the logistics of detaining and releasing
defendants who are awaiting trial. There was also a big television
screen in the courtroom. Every couple of hours, [the television would be
turned on, and Elizabeth could see]{.underline} a couple of sheriff's
deputies and anywhere from twenty to [forty- five people]{.underline}.
Some of those people were [wearing orange jumpsuits]{.underline}; others
were still in their street clothes. [All of them had been arrested
within the past day]{.underline} or so. Elizabeth watched as those
people were called, one by one, to stand in a red square that had been
painted on the floor. **[None]{.underline}** of the people [had a
lawyer]{.underline}. [They were in the county jail, and rather than take
the time and effort to bring these people to the courtroom, county
officials decided to conduct their bail hearings from the
jail]{.underline} itself via a video link. [The idea that officials
wanted to **avoid time and effort** was evident from more than just the
fact that these hearings were held on a television rather than in
person]{.underline}. The [[hearings]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves
[were]{.underline} incredibly **[perfunctory]{.underline}**. "[They
[lasted]{.mark}]{.underline} anywhere from **[[twenty
seconds]{.underline}]{.mark}** to maybe a minute and a half---three
minutes at the outside," Elizabeth calculated. "The hearing officer
would make a finding of probable cause, basically confirm the bail
amount that was printed on the court's bail schedule, and ask the person
if they wanted a lawyer to be appointed for their case. And then they
would move on to the next person. [[It was]{.mark}]{.underline}
basically [[a]{.underline} **[cattle call]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [one
person after the next]{.underline}." Elizabeth sat in the back of the
courtroom for several days watching these bail hearings. She also spent
some time in the courtrooms of judges who handle misdemeanor
cases---low-level crimes that carry punishments of less than a year in
jail. She noticed that the people she saw on television in their bail
hearings would end up in the misdemeanor courtrooms a day or two later.
"I would see the exact same people coming through the courtrooms," she
remembered. "[They were shackled together in orange jumpsuits [to enter
guilty pleas]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And [the [sentences]{.mark}
they received [were]{.mark} almost [always to time
served]{.mark}]{.underline}." Elizabeth took detailed notes of what she
saw in these courtrooms. She saw hearing officers deny personal bonds to
people because they were homeless and to people who had committed crimes
of poverty, like sleeping at a bus stop or asking for change outside of
a gas station. She saw the officers treat the people appearing before
them very rudely, telling them to "shut up" and "stop talking" And
doubling people's bail if they thought the person was being
disrespectful. Elizabeth took all of these notes back with her to
Washington, D.C. She used to be a public defender, but she had left that
job to join a new civil rights organization. Civil Rights Corps had been
filing civil rights lawsuits against small towns primarily in the South.
Those [towns were keeping poor people in jail for weeks on low-level
offenses]{.underline} just [because they couldn't afford the bail
amounts that had been set by the judges]{.underline}. Judges don't
necessarily agree whether it's constitutional to keep people in jail
just because they can't afford bail. The Supreme Court has said that
poor people can't be sent to jail as punishment simply because they are
unable to pay their fines, but the [justices haven't addressed whether
people can be detained before trial because they are too poor to pay
bail]{.underline}. State courts and lower federal courts are split on
the issue. Nonetheless, when Elizabeth's colleagues brought their early
bail lawsuits, they would win because these towns' practices were
incredibly difficult to defend: [it]{.underline} just [doesn't seems
wrong to keep poor people in jail for weeks at a time for nuisance
crimes like jaywalking and public intoxication when people with access
to a few hundred dollars can go home]{.underline}. Having racked up some
wins in these small towns, Civil Rights Corps was looking for someplace
to test their litigation strategy on a larger scale. Elizabeth spent
months doing research online and speaking to grassroots organizations.
She made the trip to Houston to see whether it might be the right place
for their lawsuit. Her investigation convinced them that it was, and so
they filed a lawsuit against the sheriff, the county, and the hearing
officers. The lawsuit claimed that these [officials were **violating**
the civil rights of misdemeanor defendants who were too poor to pay the
bail amounts]{.underline} [that the hearing officers were
setting]{.underline}. The hearing officers in Houston were following
something called a bail schedule---a list of suggested dollar amounts
for each crime that defendants must pay before a judge will agree to
release them. Bail schedules are quite common. The idea behind them is
that judges shouldn't be setting different bail amounts for people
accused of the same crime because that wouldn't seem fair. But [[bail
schedules]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves aren't particularly fair. For
one thing, bail schedules often [[set]{.mark} bail [amounts]{.mark}
**incredibly high**, even for crimes that don't pose any danger to the
public]{.underline}. For example, the 2021 bail schedule in Los Angeles
suggests that judges set bail at \$25,000 for bribery and \$50,000 for
campaign finance violations. [Bail schedules are also unfair because
[they set]{.mark} [the same amount for everyone]{.mark} [rather
than]{.mark} different amounts based on a defendant's [ability to
pay]{.mark}]{.underline} or the likelihood that they would come to court
without paying bail. Elizabeth found that the [hearing officers in
Houston were **blindly** following the bail schedule instead of asking
defendants about their ability to pay]{.underline}. In fact, during her
investigation, Elizabeth interviewed several hearing
[officers]{.underline} and discovered that they [weren't even allowed to
deviate from the bail schedule at these bail hearings]{.underline}. When
Elizabeth spoke with me about the lawsuit in Houston, she emphasized
both the systemic and the individual impact of the bail practices. She
explained that Civil Rights Corps chose to litigate in Harris County
(where Houston is located) because it is a huge system. It has a
population of more than 4.5 million people, making it the third largest
county in the country. Around 45,000 people are arrested every year in
the county on misdemeanor charges, many of them too poor to pay bail.
Elizabeth also stressed the very human problems faced by their clients:
Maranda ODonnell, who had been arrested for driving with a suspended
license, was told that she could return home immediately, but only if
she paid money bail of \$2,500. Loetha McGruder was arrested for drug
possession and told she had to pay \$5,000 or she would be detained.
Robert Ryan Ford was arrested for shoplifting from Walmart and was also
told that he had to pay \$5,000 in order to be released from jail. All
of Elizabeth's clients were poor. Even those who had jobs had no hope of
being able to come up with that sort of money. Yet none of them were
ever asked if they could afford to pay these bail amounts. And there
were [hundreds of other people in the Harris County jails just like
them---people who had been arrested for low-level crimes and who could
have been **released immediately** only if they could pay the amount on
the bail schedule]{.underline}. [[Because]{.mark} Elizabeth's [clients
couldn't pay, they ended up back in the courtroom a
day]{.mark}]{.underline} or two [later, [pleading guilty]{.mark}.
[If]{.mark} [they didn't]{.mark} [plead guilty, they'd]{.mark} have to
[sit in jail]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **weeks** or even **[months]{.mark}**,
[waiting]{.mark} [for]{.mark} their [trials]{.mark} to be
scheduled]{.underline}. [[The **desire to be free**]{.mark}---to go home
to their families and their jobs---[**overwhelmed** any desire to invoke
their right to a trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. Elizabeth and her
colleagues at Civil Rights Corps are not the only people to file a bail
lawsuit. Nor were they the only organization drawing attention to
pretrial detention in Houston. But their lawsuit had a lasting impact.
The federal judge in the lawsuit held a hearing at which Elizabeth and
her colleagues presented mountains of evidence about the
unconstitutionality of the Houston bail practices. "The hearing was
hugely cathartic. Community members packed the courtroom. It was the
first time that the money bail system had been tested in open
court---the first time that the rationality of it, the effectiveness of
it, and the harms that it causes had been aired in any forum even
approximating this and with such a significant level of time,
investment, and attention," Elizabeth said. She explained that the data
analysis, court testimony, and the bail hearing videos that were
presented at the hearing "changed the way people thought about what the
system is doing." It was, as Elizabeth put it, an opportunity to "put
money bail on trial." While she was at the hearing, she kept thinking
about all of the people whom she saw standing in a red square during
their bail hearings and who then got sent to jail for days or weeks: "It
felt like we were putting the judges, the other defendants, and the
whole system sort of in that red square in a way--- holding them up to
scrutiny." After the hearing, the federal judge granted them something
called a preliminary injunction---a ruling that allows a judge to
require or prohibit certain actions before a trial takes place. In order
to grant a preliminary injunction, a judge has to find that a plaintiff
(the person who brought the lawsuit) is likely to win at trial and that
there will be irreparable damage or injury if the judge waits until
trial to address the conduct underlying the lawsuit. The preliminary
injunction required county officials to determine whether every person
arrested for a misdemeanor was able to pay bail, and it ordered them to
release everyone who could not pay and who would have been released if
they had been able to. Harris County officials fought hard against the
judge's decision to grant the preliminary injunction. They appealed and
managed to get some of the important parts of the judge's decision
overruled. The case was scheduled to go to trial in December 2018 when
something momentous happened. The November 2018 elections gave Democrats
a majority of county commissioners, and all of the Republican judges
lost their reelection campaigns---a result that some saw as a
"reckoning" for what they had done in the bail system. These new
officials entered into settlement negotiations with Elizabeth and her
colleagues at Civil Rights Corps. Those negotiations resulted in a
consent decree---basically a contract that the parties could enforce
through the federal courts. That consent decree made sweeping changes to
the misdemeanor bail system in Houston. The Houston bail litigation
received a lot of national media attention. It also created an important
precedent that people can't be detained pretrial simply because they are
too poor to pay their bail. But despite the attention and the precedent,
Elizabeth was very cognizant of the limitations of their win. The
federal court had criticized specific legal aspects of the Houston
system---the rigid bail schedule and the failure to ask defendants about
their financial ability to pay bail. "But if you take away the bail
schedule, without other reforms and significant culture change, there is
a risk that the system will revert to the same levels of pretrial
detention," she noted. For that reason, the consent decree includes
strict limitations on the use of money bail, which can no longer be used
as a condition of release in most misdemeanor cases, as well as other
provisions that are intended to change the way that the courts operate.
She emphasized that money bail is not the fundamental problem. "You
know, pretrial detention is the problem---just [the number of people we
have in jail and the fact that they are overwhelmingly Black or
Brown]{.underline}." I asked Elizabeth if she had seen a change in other
cities and counties after the Civil Rights Corps win in Houston. I was
curious about this because I'd heard defense attorneys here in North
Carolina warn judges and prosecutors that local bail practices could
draw a civil rights lawsuit from Elizabeth and her colleagues. "Yeah,
you do see jurisdictions trying to differentiate themselves from Houston
and Harris County. But the fact is that they're all---or at least most
places across the country are---doing exactly the same thing. They are
doing it in one way or another, but the result is that way too many
people are detained pretrial." \* \* \* \* \* "You can't understand the
criminal justice system and how we arrived at mass incarceration unless
you understand the story of bail," Shima Baradaran Baughman told me.
Shima is a law professor and one of the country's leading experts on
bail and pretrial detention. Shima's interest in bail grew out of a
Fulbright fellowship to Malawi. Knowing that she would have the
opportunity to conduct research while in Malawi, Shima spent some time
before her Fulbright trying to identify what major criminal justice
problems were facing the landlocked African nation. She discovered that
Malawi had a serious problem with pretrial detention. One man had been
detained for seventeen years before trial without charges, and there
were many other people who had been detained for a year or more. During
her two years in Malawi, she not only did research on the country's
pretrial detention system, but she also did legal aid work. At one point
her work made the newspapers because she was able to get fifty people at
once released on bail pending trial. When Shima returned to the United
States, she was curious about how the bail system she studied in Malawi
compared to the bail systems in the United States. She began by looking
at the journals where academic articles about law are published, and she
found that the last article written about bail was published in 1990.
When she started updating the research in 2011, Shima discovered [the
staggering increase in pretrial detention]{.underline} that [began in
the 1990s]{.underline}. In the ten years since she has been writing
about bail, many other law professors have begun writing on the topic,
and [legal advocacy groups like Civil Rights Corps have been filing
lawsuits to challenge pretrial detention practices]{.underline} across
the country. Shima's research shows the problems with the harsh
punishment in America aren't just about mandatory minimums and lengthy
sentences; those problems begin the moment that someone is arrested.
"[After arrest, bail is the **most important** decision that is
made]{.underline}. Those two decisions---[arrest and
bail]{.underline}---[are the **most important**]{.underline} [when it
comes to mass]{.underline} [incarceration]{.underline} and to fixing the
racial inequities that we see," she explained. She cited a series of
studies from the past fifty years that showed that [[Black defendants
are more likely to be arrested and detained]{.mark} before trial than
White defendants]{.underline}. Studies also show that both [[Black and
Hispanic]{.underline}]{.mark} defendants, as a group, [have to [pay
higher bail amounts]{.mark} to be released than White defendants charged
with the same crimes]{.underline}. Shima knows a lot about the data
behind pretrial detention because she worked with an economist to
analyze data about recidivism---the rates at which people who have
committed crimes in the past go on to commit new crimes in the future.
They found that [judges were detaining large numbers of people in jail
who were unlikely to commit new crimes, especially not violent
crime]{.underline}s. Shima and the economist concluded that judges could
safely release many more people without increasing crime in those
communities. [Keeping those people in jail was not only harmful to the
people detained but also expensive. Taxpayers were paying **millions**
of dollars to keep people locked up---money that could be spent in much
better ways because it wasn't necessary to keep people
safe]{.underline}. In recent years, a number of cities and states have
adopted "risk assessment instruments," which are supposed to help judges
make more consistent and more accurate decisions about who should be
detained pretrial. A risk assessment instrument is basically a
questionnaire. Its questions are designed to estimate how likely a
person is to commit a crime if released before trial using data about
past arrests. While Shima thinks that using data-driven approaches can
lead to better decisions, she has concerns about the risk assessment
tools that are currently available She analyzed the various instruments
that cities and counties are using and concluded that "they are mostly
getting it wrong"---that is to say, the instruments weren't well
designed to actually identify those few people who pose a real risk of
violence if released. As a result, the risk instruments currently in use
are going to continue to keep people in jail who aren't dangerous. In
addition, those [[risk instruments]{.mark} also unfairly [treat Black
defendants worse]{.mark} than White defendants]{.underline}. "[Because a
lot of these instruments include questions like '[Do you own a
home]{.mark}?' or 'Do you have a [cell phone]{.mark}?' they end up
having racially disproportionate impacts]{.underline}. I mean, [most
Black people don't own a home. Whites are **ten times** more likely to
own a home than Blacks]{.underline}. We know that Whites are more likely
to own a home than Blacks, so why would you put that in a bail release
calculation? Do you have to own a home in order to show up at a court
hearing? Of course not. So we need to stop asking questions about
socioeconomic status in bail questionnaires, especially since we know
that those questions will harm people of color." Elizabeth Rossi said
that these sorts of questions were being used in Houston when Civil
Rights Corps brought their bail lawsuit. "The background questions
included things like '[Do you have a [car]{.mark}?' and 'Do you have a
landline]{.underline}.' And there were also questions about [who lived
in]{.underline} [your household]{.underline}. [These questions
were]{.underline} all just really **[questions about
poverty]{.underline}**. And so [the [more]{.mark} [indicators of
poverty]{.mark} you have, [the higher]{.mark} [your]{.mark} risk score
is, and the more likely you have to pay a high
[bail]{.mark}]{.underline} or be detained." Elizabeth noted that this
old risk assessment instrument was abandoned and replaced with a new
instrument from the Arnold Foundation during their litigation. But
Elizabeth wasn't convinced that the new instrument was something to
celebrate, saying that even facially neutral [risk assessment
instruments]{.underline} rely on [data]{.underline} from a system that
[is **deeply racist**]{.underline}. If the [[data]{.underline}]{.mark}
being used to create a risk assessment instrument comes from a system
that [disproportionately [targets, arrests, and convicts poor people and
people of color]{.mark}]{.underline}, then we should expect that
data---and any instrument that comes from that data---to be skewed.
Whatever the problems associated with risk assessments, those
instruments didn't create the pretrial detention problem in this
country. The dramatic increase in people held pretrial and the financial
guarantees began many years before cities, counties, and states started
using risk assessment instruments. The dramatic increase also can't be
explained by the law-and- order crackdown that took place in the 1980s.
Any changes attributable to the new focus on danger would have made its
way through the system years before the increase that occurred in the
1990s and 2000s.

#### More pre-trial detention increase exploitation by bail-bond industry

**Hessick 21** \[Carissa Byrne Hessick, Ransdell Distinguished Professor
of Law at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where she also
serves as the director of the Prosecutors and Politics Project, 2021,

So I asked Shima: What changed? "It took me a few years to figure this
out," she replied. "It wasn't until I did a deeper dive into money bail
practices that I discovered the role that the bail industry played." The
bail bond industry is made up of small companies that help provide the
financial guarantee for defendants who are in jail before trial. Because
most people who are arrested can't afford to pay the bail amount set by
the judge, bail companies will cover the bail for defendants in return
for a fee--- usually 10 to 15 percent of the bail amount. If the
defendant doesn't show up for a court appearance, then the bail bondsman
might be required to forfeit the bail amount. But [the defendant doesn't
get the fee back from the bail bondsman if she shows up for all of her
court]{.underline} [appearances]{.underline}. Even [[if the defendant
is]{.mark} [acquitted]{.mark} at trial or the prosecutor ultimately
dismisses the charges, [the defendant still owes]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
bail [bond]{.mark}sman the fee]{.underline}. [The [bail industry
is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[incredibly
profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It makes]{.mark} an estimated
**\$[2 billion per year]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And although
the businesses that actually post bail for defendants tend to be small,
the [[insurance]{.mark} [companies]{.mark} that underwrite]{.underline}
[those]{.underline} small [companies are]{.underline} quite
[big]{.underline}. [They [have]{.mark} [a]{.mark} significant [economic
interest in]{.mark} having [more]{.mark} cases where money [bail]{.mark}
is [required]{.mark} and in having those bail amounts be
higher]{.underline}. Sometimes they have even been successful in
convincing courts and other public officials not to actually collect the
money that is forfeited when a defendant doesn't show up for a court
date. "[The bail industry is a **multibillion-dollar** industry. And the
[bail]{.mark} insurance [industry]{.mark} is their **[lobbying]{.mark}**
arm]{.underline}," Shima explained. "[In the 1990s the bail insurance
industry designed a multijurisdictional campaign to [convince]{.mark}
people in state and local [governments]{.mark} [to]{.mark} make
decisions that would be [help]{.mark}ful for [the bail
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. They gave money to people running for
state legislature, for sheriff, for judge, and for local prosecutor.
They did this because [they wanted to change the default from having
defendants released on their own recognizance to paying money bail
instead]{.underline}. "And they were so successful," she continued. "If
you look [from 1990 on, we've dramatically increased reliance on money
bail]{.underline}. Now, in the United States, [money bail is the most
common way for a defendant to be released,]{.underline} while it used to
be release on recognizance." I pushed back a bit on the story that Shima
was telling. I haven't found a lot of bail bond--related money in my own
research on campaign contributions in local prosecutor elections. I'm
generally somewhat skeptical of claims that the problems with the
criminal justice system can be traced to the profit motive. For example,
a number of people insist that the problems of mass incarceration are
attributable to private prisons. But in reality, private prisons house
less than 10 percent of the country's prisoners. And the incarceration
rates in states that have private prisons don't appear to be growing any
faster than states without them. But Shima pushed back as well. "It
actually is the profit motive," she insisted. She pointed to all of the
major legal groups, including the [American Bar
Association]{.underline}, that [have come out strongly against the
concept of money]{.underline} [[bail]{.underline}]{.mark}. The groups
have come out against money bail because [it]{.underline} literally
[[treats people differently depending on]{.mark} how much [money]{.mark}
they have---something that [everyone knows is **unfair**]{.mark}. But
the bail bond industry has repeatedly blocked attempts at bail reform,
spending millions of dollars in campaign contributions and to lobby
state lawmakers]{.underline}. To give me a sense of how powerful the
bail bond industry is, Shima spoke about her own experience with state
bail reform. A few years ago, she was invited to a meeting of local
officials and stakeholders who were looking to reform the bail system.
Sitting around the table with public officials and experts like Shima
was a representative of the bail lobby. Shima was very surprised to see
the lobbyist, who had been invited as a "stakeholder." "I'm thinking to
myself, 'What? In what world does this guy get to sit in here?' " But he
did. And the reforms that came out of that group, Shima pointed out,
didn't include any reforms that were going to meaningfully decrease the
number of people being detained in jail. Pretrial detention has become
so common in this country that attempts to change it have met with
serious resistance. The lawsuits that the Civil Rights Corps and other
organizations file are hotly contested by local officials. And when
those officials actually try to make changes themselves, they sometimes
find that other local officials block their attempts at reform.

#### Defendants either plea bargain for early release with time served, or being penalized for poverty via pretrial detention and the bond industry, which post-neg, is the only option

\* \* \* \* \* Pretrial detention has become so common in this country
that attempts to change it have met with serious resistance. The
lawsuits that the Civil Rights Corps and other organizations file are
hotly contested by local officials. And when those officials actually
try to make changes themselves, they sometimes find that other local
officials block their attempts at reform. That's what happened in
Boston. Efrain Rivera was arrested for shoplifting at the Gap in a
Boston mall. Mr. Rivera, who struggles with drug addiction, was no
stranger to the criminal justice system at the time of his arrest. He
had been arrested many times before. Some of those arrests had resulted
in convictions, and others were still pending when officers arrested him
for shoplifting. Often, someone who has pending criminal charges will
not be released if they get arrested on new charges. But Boston had a
new prosecutor, Rachael Rollins, who was elected as Boston's district
attorney in 2018. Rollins ran on a platform of criminal justice reform.
One area she thought needed reform was bail. "[[Bail]{.mark} is one of
the biggest things that [exposes the]{.mark} **[penalty of
poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[the **penalization** of
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}," Rollins said when we spoke on a Wednesday
afternoon. "[Imagine [you are poor and I am not]{.mark} poor and we are
charged with the exact same crime]{.underline}---say it is operating
with a suspended license, and maybe bail is \$250. [If you don't have
that money, you are going to stay in jail. But if [I]{.mark} do
[have]{.mark} that [money]{.mark}, then [I'm getting]{.mark}
[out]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[It's a powerful example of
**injustice**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Rollins knows it: "For non-
lawyers [[it is]{.mark} so **[crystal clear]{.mark}** that [that has
**nothing**]{.mark} [to do with whether you're a good person]{.mark}, or
I'm a good person, or you committed the crime, or I didn't commit the
crime]{.underline}. [[It has **everything** to do with the fact **I have
money and you don't**]{.underline}]{.mark}." Rollins doesn't just talk
about the problems with bail; she has also made changes within her
office to help minimize the number of people held in jail pretrial. One
change that she made involved the training for her prosecutors. As part
of their training, she now requires all prosecutors to visit the Nashua
Street jail, where Boston sends most people it detains pretrial. Rollins
made the jail visit mandatory because, as she put it, the prosecutors
"have the ability to set bail and send people away, and so they should
have to set foot in the place where those people are going to go." The
changes that Rollins made meant that the prosecutors in her office treat
Mr. Rivera differently. The prosecutor in that case told the judge that
she didn't think Mr. Rivera needed to be kept in jail until his trial.
His crime was minor, there was no reason to think that he wouldn't
appear at his court dates, and he was getting treatment for his
substance abuse problem. Sending Mr. Rivera to jail would interfere with
that treatment, and so the prosecutor argued that releasing him pretrial
was the best course of action.

#### A lengthier involvement with the criminal justice system is more damaging than the punishment that defendants prefer pleading guilty over the punishment of process of a trial -- star this card

**Hessick 21** \[Carissa Byrne Hessick, Ransdell Distinguished Professor

Sometimes, Feeley reported, the bargaining occurred across cases: a
prosecutor would tell a defense attorney that he could not dismiss
charges in a case because that defense attorney had already had his
"quota" of dismissals that day. Or a defense attorney would argue in
favor of a dismissal by noting that he hadn't asked the prosecutor for
anything yet that day. As for the due process model, Feeley didn't just
say what everyone already knows---that it doesn't accurately describe
the criminal justice system. Instead, he turned the due process model on
its head, presenting it as a problematic approach to criminal justice.
Most people praise the due process model as an ideal (if impossible to
achieve) system. But Feeley tells us that
[[defendants]{.underline}]{.mark} may actually [[try to
**avoid**]{.mark} some of [the process]{.mark} that [they are
due]{.mark}]{.underline}. As he explained, [**[any contact]{.mark}**
with the criminal justice system [was **unpleasant** and
**costly**]{.mark} for defendants.]{.underline} [[Invoking the
process]{.mark} that they were entitled to [would]{.mark} often
**[prolong]{.mark}** the defendants' [interactions]{.mark} with the
criminal justice system]{.underline}, and so [defendants **readily give
up** their ability]{.underline} to test the prosecution's evidence or
even secure a lawyer [because [those rights meant more time and]{.mark}
[effort]{.mark} for the defendant]{.underline}. This was nothing short
of a bombshell when Feeley's book was published. [The process that he
tells us defendants were trying to avoid exists]{.underline}, in large
[part, to protect those defendants]{.underline}. It is part of the "[due
process]{.underline} of law" guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But
more important, Feeley demonstrated that the system [could "**punish**"
people merely by bringing them into the system]{.underline}. [Even those
defendants who were acquitted or whose cases were dismissed had to
endure an arrest and [court appearances]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
[experiences [impose costs on and **demean**]{.mark} everyone who is
subjected to them]{.underline}. [For [defendants]{.mark}, one of the
major costs of the criminal process is having to show up at
court]{.underline}. Feeley found that [[cases **dragged on** for]{.mark}
[**unbelievably** long]{.mark} amounts of [time]{.mark}]{.underline}:
"[Cases in which there was no trial, no witnesses, no formal motions, no
pretrial involvement from the bench, and no presentence investigation
still **required** as many as]{.underline} eight or [**[ten]{.mark}**
different **[appearances]{.mark}** spread over six months]{.underline}."
[These]{.underline} appearances not only [[discouraged]{.mark} people
from [insisting on]{.mark} their right to [a trial]{.mark}]{.underline};
they also discouraged defendants from having protracted negotiations to
get a better plea bargain from prosecutors. As a result, defendants with
complex cases would plead guilty at arraignment rather than trying to
wait and convince the prosecutor to give them a better deal. As Scott
Hechinger said when we spoke in Brooklyn, [the costs of coming to court
are literal and figurative. [It]{.mark} literally [costs]{.mark}
[defendants]{.mark} \$5.50 round trip on public transportation to travel
to the courthouse for every appearance]{.underline}. That might not seem
like a large amount of money to a middle-class defendant. But [for those
who are not financially secure, that is an added expense they can ill
afford]{.underline}. For some of his clients, Scott said that this
\$[5.50 is "the difference between eating and putting **[food on the
table]{.mark}**" or going without]{.underline}. The figurative
costs---which academics call "**[[opportunity
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**"---[are]{.underline} all of the
[other]{.underline} [things that a defendant can't do when they have to
appear in court. [They can't go to]{.mark} [work]{.mark}, take care of
their children]{.underline}, go to a doctor's appointment, or do any of
the other dozens of things that we all need to do every day just to keep
our lives on track. "Just [having to come to]{.underline}
[court]{.underline} in and of itself---let alone the six or seven times
that they would have to come [if they ever wanted to possibly get to the
point where they'd get a trial---is a **horrible**, **punishing**
process]{.underline}," Scott stated. [Appearing in [court]{.mark} is not
the only source of "costs" for defendants. The right to have a lawyer
represent them also [imposes]{.mark} either literal or figurative
costs]{.underline}. [Any defendant who wants to hire her own lawyer will
have to pay the costs of that [lawyer's fee]{.mark} out of her own
pocket]{.underline}. And [lawyers are **not** **cheap**]{.underline}. Of
course, defendants who can't afford lawyers can ask judges to appoint
lawyers for them. But, as I explained in chapter 5, [[some
places]{.mark}]{.underline} still manage to [charge defendants money
[for]{.mark} their "[free" lawyers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even in those
places that don't charge defendants money for their appointed lawyers,
[[defendants]{.mark} still have to [expend **significant**]{.mark} time
and [effort to prove]{.mark} that [they are entitled to free
lawyers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The defendants have to fill out forms
that ask **invasive** financial questions, and they have to be prepared
to answer further questions by judges or other court personnel who might
be skeptical]{.underline} of their claim that they can't afford to pay
for a lawyer. [The process of getting a court-appointed lawyer
can]{.underline} also [be **humiliating**]{.underline}. When I clerked
for a judge after I graduated from law school, one defendant asked for a
court-appointed lawyer, but the prosecution objected. My judge held a
hearing at which the prosecutor argued that the defendant should sell
his car to pay for an attorney. When the defendant pointed out that the
proceeds from selling his car would not be enough to pay a lawyer for
his whole case, the government attorney responded that the defendant
should sell his car, use that money to pay for a lawyer, and then come
back to the court and ask for a court-appointed lawyer after the money
ran out. There was little doubt in my mind that making the defendant
switch lawyers partway through his case would be inefficient: the first
lawyer wouldn't be able to accomplish much, and then the new,
court-appointed lawyer would have to get up to speed. So making the
defendant sell his car wouldn't really save the taxpayers much money,
but it would leave the defendant without his car even after the case was
over. Feeley also documented that the [[people]{.mark} who worked in the
system [saw contact with the system]{.mark} [itself as]{.mark} a form of
[punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [He saw prosecutors tell defendants to
plead guilty at arraignment]{.underline}---including a defendant a with
complex case that could have benefited from further investigation and
negotiations---[on the theory that they should "be smart and get it over
with today." The inconvenience associated with being arrested was also
perceived as punishment]{.underline}. Feeley observed: "[Officials are
often willing to drop minor charges, feeling that the arrestees have
learned their lesson by spending a night in jail]{.underline}." That
sort of attitude makes sense [if pretrial incarceration is a punishment;
after all, many misdemeanors are very minor offenses that don't deserve
more than a night in jail]{.underline}. But as chapter 4 explains, our
criminal justice system constantly maintains the fiction that pretrial
incarceration is not punishment. By tearing down that fiction---that
nothing we do to defendants before they are convicted is
punishment---Feeley exposes perhaps the greatest injustice of our modern
system: [it indiscriminately punishes the guilty and the innocent. The
costs of the pretrial system are borne by everyone who is swept up in
it: guilty defendants, innocent defendants, and]{.underline} even [their
family members]{.underline}. \* \* \* \* \* Looking at the people seated
around us in the Brooklyn courtroom, I could see what Feeley (and Scott)
meant. [The people waiting in the courtroom were being subjected to a
form of punishment; they resembled children in detention at school as
they sat on the benches, not permitted to talk or]{.underline} even to
[read]{.underline}. The way in which the judge spoke to them---not
rudely but somewhat condescendingly---also reminded me of a principal or
a teacher telling a student what he had done wrong. Most of the people
whom Scott and I saw in that courtroom had been released, sometimes on
bail. They were home with their friends and families while their cases
wound their way through the system. Because they had been charged with
misdemeanors, even if they lost at trial, they were not facing
particularly severe punishments. As Scott explained, even though
misdemeanors could result in a sentence of up to a year in jail, the
prosecutors in Brooklyn rarely sought jail sentences, and judges rarely
imposed them. Nonetheless, the vast majority of these people will plead
guilty rather than insist on a trial. Scott said that approximately
[[**40 percent** of misdemeanor defendants plead guilty as soon as
they]{.mark} are able to [see a judge]{.mark}]{.underline}. And for
[those cases that don't plead guilty at their first judicial
appearance]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} steadily **[trickle
out]{.underline}** of the system [before a trial]{.underline} takes
place. Some of the defendants have their charges dismissed. Others
eventually decide to plead guilty; [some]{.underline} decide to
[plead]{.underline} because the prosecutors are willing to reduce the
charges against them, others [because [they get sick of having to come
back to court so]{.mark} [many times]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some of the
defendants will enter an alternative treatment program. At the end of
the day, Scott estimated that, at most, 1 percent of misdemeanor cases
in Brooklyn go to trial. That cases were leaking out of the system
became clear as Scott took me from courtroom to courtroom in the
Brooklyn courthouse. The first courtroom ---the one that resembled the
public restroom---was where misdemeanor defendants made their initial
appearance before a judge. It was the largest and most crowded courtroom
that I'd ever seen. The subsequent courtrooms we visited---the ones
where people would make additional appearances before judges, where
suppression hearings were held, and where defendants facing felony
charges appeared---had fewer defendants in them. The courtrooms were
also smaller, more formal, and less dingy, but still far from welcoming.
One of the last courtrooms we visited was part of a specialized court---
specifically a court that dealt with defendants whose crimes were
related to substance abuse. When we entered the courtroom, a man who had
been arrested for drunk driving was being admitted into the program. The
man was tall and broad-chested. He seemed like the sort of person who
would take up two or three seats on the subway, not only because of his
size but also because he'd feel entitled to the extra space. But in the
courtroom, the man did not exude an air of self-confidence or
entitlement. His broad shoulders drooped as he listened to the judge
tell him, very sternly, the consequences of failing out of the program.
The Brooklyn substance abuse treatment program is structured as an
alternative to incarceration. It requires defendants to plead guilty in
order to enter the program and avoid jail. For defendants facing felony
charges, that means they plead guilty to two crimes, a felony and a
misdemeanor. After they plead guilty, their sentences are
withheld---that is to say, the sentences aren't imposed until after they
complete the treatment program. If a defendant successfully completes
the program, then the judge will vacate the felony plea, removing the
guilty plea on that charge from the defendant's criminal record. Since
felonies often carry mandatory minimum sentences, getting the felony
pleas vacated and those charges dismissed is really beneficial for
defendants. Once a felony plea has been vacated, the only charge left is
the misdemeanor, and then the judge will impose a sentence on the
misdemeanor ---not incarceration but some other small punishment. The
man whom we saw pleading guilty in the drunk-driving case was facing
felony charges because this wasn't his first DUI. If he successfully
completes the program, then he will be sentenced just for a
misdemeanor---a sentence of only a \$500 fine. But if he doesn't
complete the treatment program successfully, he won't get the felony
vacated. He'll be sentenced for that felony, and he will end up in jail.
As the judge explained all of this to the defendant, it sounded really
daunting. The judge emphasized that the treatment would be demanding and
that if the defendant did not do everything required of him, then the
prosecutor would be free to seek the maximum sentence on the felony. In
other words, the judge told the defendant that if he failed to complete
the treatment program, he would almost certainly end up spending no
small amount of time in jail. The judge also explained the requirements
of the treatment program. One of the requirements was that the defendant
had to pay for the costs of treatment. But as the man told his defense
lawyer, the treatment itself was going to interfere with his work hours.
And if he couldn't get enough hours at work, then he wouldn't have the
money that he needed to pay for the costs of the program. The lawyer
explained the problem to the judge. The judge understood that the
defendant was in a catch-22. But it was quickly made clear to the
defendant that the problem was his, not the court's. It was up to the
defendant to figure out how to attend treatment and still work enough
hours so that he could pay for that treatment and all of the other
expenses in his life. After we left the courtroom, I asked Scott what
would happen if the defendant couldn't attend all of the treatment
sessions or if he couldn't pay for them. It's complicated. Scott
stressed that the judge in the treatment court wouldn't kick the
defendant out of the program right away; they generally give people a
number of chances if they miss an appointment, don't make their
payments, or have a urine sample test positive for marijuana. But there
would be smaller punishments along the way for these lapses: an
outpatient treatment regime might get converted into an in-patient
regime, forcing the defendant to live in an institution while undergoing
substance abuse treatment. Or the time in the treatment program could be
extended from twelve months to eighteen months. Judges in the treatment
programs could also give a lapsed defendant a short jail punishment of a
week or two at Rikers Island. Obviously, ending up in an institution or
in jail would prevent the defendant from working and being able to pay
for his treatment. And if the defendant's treatment got extended because
he was missing payments, he would probably just end up missing even more
payments. The drunk-driving defendant was warning his lawyer and the
judge about these problems, but it didn't matter. He was pleading guilty
anyway, even though he could see that there was a significant chance
that he might fail the program and end up in jail. Substance abuse
treatment courts have been touted as a good alternative to incarcerating
people who break the law. The basic idea behind these courts is that
some people commit crimes because they are abusing drugs or alcohol, and
their criminal activity is more likely to continue so long as they
continue to abuse these substances. If the system can get them to stop
abusing alcohol or drugs, so the argument goes, then they will also stop
committing crimes. So the objective in substance abuse courts is to
treat the substance abuse problem and use the threat of criminal
punishment to get defendants to comply with the terms of the treatment
program. But drug courts are only a good alternative to jail if they
actually work. "I've had clients who have succeeded. But I've had more
clients who have not succeeded and ended up in jail," Scott told me. And
sometimes, he added, the clients who enter these treatment programs and
who fail end up worse off than if they had just pleaded guilty in the
first place. Scott recounted the story of one client who could serve as
a poster child for ending up worse off. Scott's client was charged with
burglary in the third degree for stealing some things from a bodega. The
client wasn't eligible for bail, so he was sitting in jail. After he'd
been in jail for nine months, Scott convinced the judge to let the
client enter an alternative-to-incarceration plea. The plea required the
client to do eighteen to twenty-four months of treatment, the first year
of which would be in an inpatient program. The year of inpatient
treatment was very successful and, against the odds, the client appeared
to have actually kicked his substance addiction. But when he was
released from the inpatient program, no one helped him set up his
outpatient appointments, and he didn't have any insurance to cover those
treatments. So the client relapsed, and he ended up getting rearrested
for assaulting another man and taking his phone. Because the client was
already in the treatment program, he wasn't eligible to be released from
jail pending trial when he was arrested for the new charges. So he ended
up pleading guilty in the new case, just so that he could be released
from jail, even though he disputed taking the phone and assaulting the
other man. The new charges resulted in the drug court judge sending him
back to the inpatient treatment program, but at that point the client
wasn't interested in receiving treatment. "He was just kind of gone at
that point," Scott said. The client ended up failing out of the
treatment program, and he was facing sentencing on the bodega burglary
charges when I interviewed Scott. "He faces a mandatory minimum of one
and a half to three years, which means he'll be eligible for parole
after one and a half years. But I don't think he'll be released on
parole," Scott said. His client actually ended up worse off by entering
the treatment program than if he'd just pleaded guilty to the charges in
the first instance. In addition to spending more than a year living in
an institution for his inpatient substance abuse treatment, he's going
to have to serve the same sentence that he would have gotten if he'd
never entered the program in the first place. "This started out as an
eighteen- to twenty-four-month program, but this whole ordeal has been
going on for four years," Scott said. At this point the client wants to
put the ordeal behind him and he is frustrated with the prosecutor, with
the judge, and with Scott because these petty charges have kept him in
the system for years. "He keeps saying 'y'all' like I'm a part of this,
and that hurts: 'Y'all have had me for four years for stealing a few
things from a bodega to support my drug habit. When is enough, enough?'
" Scott paused for a second and then added, "Apparently, the answer is
'Not yet.' " \* \* \* \* \* Like many public defenders, Scott Hechinger
developed a passion for criminal justice in law school. He went to NYU,
where he met Bryan Stevenson, a modern hero in the fight for criminal
justice reform. In addition to teaching law at NYU, Stevenson runs the
Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights organization that has been very
successful in exonerating wrongfully convicted defendants and winning
Supreme Court victories. Stevenson's memoir, Just Mercy: A Story of
Justice and Redemption, was a New York Times #1 bestseller and has been
made into a major motion picture starring Jamie Foxx and Michael B.
Jordan. As a student, Scott did some legal research for Stevenson on
juveniles serving sentences of life in prison without the possibility of
parole. That research was part of a broader litigation strategy that
culminated in Stevenson arguing before the Supreme Court. Scott camped
out the night before the oral argument, sleeping on the sidewalk in
front of the Supreme Court, so that he could get one of the small number
of public seats in the audience. Stevenson ended up winning the case,
resulting in a landmark ruling that the Eighth Amendment forbids
mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles. Stevenson was a
mentor for Scott. When Scott told Stevenson that we wanted to pursue a
public interest career and that he wanted to use his law degree to help
tell compelling stories, Stevenson told him that the path was obvious:
he should become a public defender. Scott took Stevenson's advice and
spent one of his law school summers in New Orleans interning with the
public defender's office. It was a new office, established in the wake
Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans had never had public defenders before,
and Scott was in their second class of summer interns. Public defenders
are in a difficult situation. They are supposed to zealously protect the
rights of their clients, but they also have to get their funding from
public sources. Many chief public defenders are appointed by judges or
by other elected officials in their jurisdictions, so they can get
dragged into political fights as well. Sometimes zealous advocacy can
ruffle feathers and get the defenders in trouble. For example, the top
public defenders in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, were fired recently
after they filed a brief with the state supreme court criticizing how
judges in their county set cash bail. The judges appear to have
complained to the county commissioners, who fired the defenders. The new
public defenders in New Orleans also upset the judges, who were not used
to defense attorneys sticking up for their clients and questioning how
the courts dispensed justice. "I remember seeing supervising attorneys
getting dragged out of courtrooms in handcuffs for making simple legal
arguments," Scott said as we sat down for lunch after my tour of the
courthouse. As an intern, it was Scott's job to help the public defense
lawyers who would appear in court on behalf of indigent defendants. "My
main job was helping in arraignments, which would be held en masse," he
said. "A hundred people or so would be marched into the loading dock of
the Orleans Parish Prison, in front of an oversized TV. As an intern, I
would run and try to interview as many people as I could to find out as
much about them as I could. Then I would run the three blocks from the
prison to the courthouse, where there was one public defender sitting
next to the judge, looking at a television screen full of Black faces in
orange jumpsuits. Then bail was set, basically just depending on the
charge." According to Scott, the New Orleans public defenders would lose
all the time. Nonetheless, he was inspired by his experience. It
impressed on him that even if the defendant was going to lose, it made a
big difference have someone speak to them face-to-face and treat them
like human beings. The defendants felt listened to instead of just
feeling forgotten by the system. And so Scott decided to become a public
defender. After a short fellowship and a clerkship with a judge, Scott
joined Brooklyn Defender Services in 2012. Since joining the
organization, Scott has developed a national reputation as a critic of
the criminal justice system. He is the founder and director of Zealous,
an organization devoted to training and helping public defenders across
the country to advocate outside the courtroom for an end to mass
incarceration. We met at an academic conference organized by NYU, but
his reputation extends beyond legal academics. Teen Vogue did a profile
of him. And he has a large following on Twitter. When I ask Scott about
his rise to prominence, he tells me a story about sitting in the
Brooklyn courthouse one day, covering arraignments. He watched a
middle-aged woman being arraigned for failing to pay a surcharge. [The
woman had pleaded guilty to stealing beef jerky]{.underline} from a
bodega two months before. Because she'd been convicted, she had to pay a
\$250 surcharge. But she hadn't paid the surcharge, and so she got
arrested again. The penalty for failure to pay a surcharge, Scott
explained, was fifteen days in jail, which could be reduced to ten days
for good behavior. "The whole thing took about two minutes," Scott said.
And while the facts of the case and the implication were buried in
technical language, Scott understood those technicalities and knew what
was happening. "What I saw was [a person]{.underline} who had [pleaded
guilty for stealing food because she was hungry---something that
shouldn't be criminalized in the first place---and then she added to her
criminal record]{.underline}. She tried to pay her fine but failed. She
spent the night in jail, got brought to court, and [then got sent back
to jail for]{.underline} ten [days for simply not having any
money]{.underline}---[which is what got her in trouble in the first
place]{.underline}. And [when she gets out, she's going to be even more
damaged]{.underline}." During his time as a public defender,
[Scott]{.underline} has [tried hard not to]{.underline} lose the
inspiration from his early experiences or to allow himself to [become
desensitized]{.underline} to what he sees: "I try not to become blasé
about everyday injustice. It's so easy to because you see the same
patterns and the same things happen every day." But he knows that [many
people who work in the system do become desensitized]{.underline}. And
as he looked around the courtroom at the woman's arraignment, he saw the
[other lawyers not even paying attention to the case because it was so
**routine**]{.underline}. So he wrote about the case on Twitter. He
wanted to remind his fellow public defenders about how awful these cases
are and hoped that it could serve as a kind of call to action for the
small group of colleagues who followed his Twitter account. "I wanted to
tell them not to lose sight of this stuff---that we have an obligation
to bear witness, both because we see it happening, but also because we
understand it in a way that other people don't." Scott's tweet about the
woman's case was retweeted ten or fifteen times, which he said with a
self-deprecating laugh "was about ten or fifteen more than I'd ever
gotten before . . . except maybe from my wife, who would sometimes
retweet my stuff to make me feel better." The positive feedback, though
modest, encouraged Scott to tweet more. He started bringing his laptop
with him to arraignments. And while he's waiting between cases, he'll
sometimes tweet about the cases that he observes. "I want people to see
what I saw and understand it the way that I understood it," he said.
Scott's tweets have gone viral, giving him a platform not only to speak
about the everyday injustices that he witnesses but also to lift up the
voices of others in the system. One inmate in Texas reached out to Scott
during the coronavirus pandemic. [The seventy-one-year-old man, who was
charged with a drug crime, suffered from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.]{.underline} [He had been in solitary confinement
for]{.underline} six **[months]{.underline}**, and [jail officials
weren't supplying him with any medical care]{.underline}. Scott's tweet
about the man was retweeted more than 6,000 times. One day later, the
local prosecutor issued a statement saying that the man was being
released. In helping people learn about and understand what happens in
these courtrooms, Scott hopes not only to bring about change in specific
cases but also to help other public defenders tell the stories of people
who are caught up in the criminal justice system. And as those stories
are told more widely, and as more people see the everyday injustice that
Scott and his colleagues do, he hopes that more people will see the
criminal justice system as the wrong way to deal with problems like
poverty and addiction. \* \* \* \* \* David Jaros, a public defender
turned law professor, tells a frightening story about how [the pretrial
process can lead defendants to give up their right to a
trial]{.underline}. The story is about his former client, James.\* James
had left his apartment one day when he the police were in his building.
When officers confronted him in the hallway of his building, they
ordered James to show them his identification to prove that he lived in
the building. Because [his wallet was]{.underline} still [in his
apartment]{.underline} rather than with him, [he couldn't show them his
ID]{.underline}. So [police]{.underline} [arrested James for
trespassing]{.underline} even though he was in his own building. David
was appointed to represent James on the trespassing charge. Because he
had been arrested, James first met with David while he was still locked
up in the back of the courthouse. At that point James had spent almost
twenty-four hours in jail. His meeting with David took place right
before James was scheduled to appear in front of a judge for the first
time. During the meeting, David had to learn about James's case, tell
him what [his options were]{.underline}, and counsel him about what
decisions to make. David explained to James that there were only two
possibilities about what could happen at his first hearing: he could
either [plead guilty or]{.underline} have the judge [decide]{.underline}
whether [bail]{.underline} was required for his release. David assured
James that, in cases like this, the judge would almost certainly release
him without bail, but the judge was not going to be willing to dismiss
the charges at that first hearing. If James wanted to fight the
trespassing charge, he would be released, but he would have to return to
court for another appearance and bring proof with him that he lived in
the building. If James didn't want to fight the charges and return to
court again, David explained that James would have to plead guilty.
[Pleading guilty]{.underline} to trespassing [would be]{.underline}
considered [only a "violation" rather than a misdemeanor]{.underline},
which meant that [James wouldn't have to serve any more time in
jail]{.underline}. [He wouldn't even have a criminal record. He would
have to pay \$100 in court costs, and there was a chance he would have
to do some community service too. But [if he pleaded guilty]{.mark}, not
only would he be released immediately, but [he would not have to return
to court]{.mark}]{.underline}. [James]{.underline} told David that he
[wasn't willing to take off another day of work for a second court
appearance]{.underline}: he had already missed work because of his
arrest, and he was worried that [[more absences might result in him
getting **fired**]{.underline}]{.mark}. David told James that in order
to avoid returning to court, he would have to plead guilty then and
there. [James]{.underline} said he [wanted to plead guilty **right
away.**]{.underline} David said, "As his lawyer, I could explain the
ramifications, but it's ultimately his decision about whether or not
he's better off taking that plea or missing work." David is right that
defendants need to make their own decisions about their cases, but I was
horrified by James's story. [James pleaded guilty to **trespassing in
his own building**. He was completely innocent]{.underline} of that
charge, and it would take only one more trip to court to clear his name.
I couldn't understand how James could make that decision. But David
helped put the situation in perspective. "Can you imagine
[spend]{.underline}ing almost **[twenty-four hours]{.underline}** [in
jail and]{.underline} then [having to take another day to return to
court just to prove that you in fact had a right to be in your
building]{.underline}?" he asked me. David did, of course, have clients
who would go home, get proof that they lived in the building or that
they were legitimately visiting someone in the building, and then bring
that proof with them to the next court date to get the charges
dismissed. "But [[someone]{.mark} who doesn't want to lose his job, or
someone who makes more in a day than the court costs, [might rationally
say]{.mark}, '[I don't want to spend a day]{.mark} sitting [in
court]{.mark} and **waiting around** for my lawyer to show up and the
prosecutor to get there and then have my case called. [I'd rather
just]{.mark} [have this case resolved]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [**never**
have to come back]{.mark} here]{.underline}.' " I would like to think
that I would have made a different decision---that I would stand on
principle and insist on proving that the police who arrested me were
wrong. But, as David explained, [[getting]{.mark} the [charges dismissed
wouldn't feel like a]{.mark} [victory]{.mark}]{.underline}. "At the end
of the day, all you get is that the case is no longer there---it's been
dismissed---but [[you don't get back that]{.mark} [time]{.mark} or that
experience]{.underline}." James's story is not unique. He had been
arrested during a regular sweep of buildings in the Bronx. Officers
would swarm the hallways, and, to avoid being arrested, people had to
demonstrate that they were there to see someone or that they otherwise
had a right to be in the building. David has many stories about clients
being arrested during these sweeps. A lot of those clients had perfectly
legitimate reasons to be in those buildings. One client was arrested
when he was at a building to visit his aunt. Another was at a building
to see some friends from school---friends who lived only two doors away
from his own building. David explained that officers would take the
people over to the door of the person they said they were visiting. They
would knock on the door, and if no one answered, they'd arrest the
person. David's clients would try to tell the officers that their family
members or friends actually lived in those apartments; they just must
not be home at the moment. But officers would just say, "Fine, that's
your defense," and arrest them anyway. Then the police would take
David's clients to booking and make them sit in a jail for a day before
David would meet them for the first time and they would get to see a
judge. As a lawyer, I couldn't understand how these people were being
arrested for trespassing. "Trespassing" means entering or remaining on
someone else's property without permission. Visiting family and friends
certainly isn't trespassing. And it is legally impossible to trespass in
your own home. More important, police can't arrest you unless they have
probable cause to believe that you've committed a crime. Not having your
wallet in your pocket isn't evidence that you've committed a crime, nor
is the fact that the friend you went to visit ends up not being at home.
James and David's other clients were arrested under a program called
Operation Clean Halls in New York City. The idea behind Operation Clean
Halls was simple: to make New York apartment buildings safer and more
pleasant for their residents. The operation targeted people who were
hanging around those buildings, hassling residents, and selling drugs.
Of course, proving that someone is selling drugs isn't always easy, and
people aren't likely to harass someone else where the police can see
them. So, in order to keep people out of these apartment buildings, the
NYPD used the trespassing laws rather than having to prove that these
people were engaging in any other illegal activities. Operation Clean
Halls began in 1991. At one point, more than 8,000 buildings were
participating in the Clean Halls program; that meant that the owners had
invited the NYPD in to make these arrests. More than 3,000 of the Clean
Halls buildings were in the Bronx, which resulted in thousands of
arrests. During David's time as a public defender in the Bronx, Clean
Halls cases were, as he put it, "extraordinarily common." "It would be a
rare day if you had an arraignment shift and didn't have people who had
been arrested for trespass in a Clean Halls building." The problem, of
course, was that police weren't particularly careful when it came to
deciding who had a legitimate reason to be in a building and who didn't.
They would clear the hallways, sometimes arresting anyone that they
found without an ID. And even if you did have an ID, you had to prove to
officers that you had a legitimate reason to be in the building, even
though the Constitution requires the opposite: It requires police to
have evidence of illegal activity before arresting someone rather than
requiring people to provide proof of their innocence in order to avoid
arrest. A 2013 study by New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board
found that 40 percent of fully investigated complaints by people who had
been caught up in of Operation Clean Halls were "substantiated." That's
a bureaucratic way of saying that the officers acted improperly if not
illegally. As the report noted, this rate was twice as high as the rate
for complaints against officers outside of Clean Halls buildings. The
report strongly suggests that police were routinely violating people's
rights in the Clean Halls sweeps. Unsurprisingly, people of color were
disproportionately swept up in Operation Clean Halls. Of people who
complained to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, nearly 90 percent
were either Black or Hispanic. In 2012, three organizations---the ACLU,
the Bronx Defenders, and a group called LatinoJustice---filed a lawsuit
against the New York City Police Department, saying that Operation Clean
Halls was illegal. The groups won a preliminary injunction against the
program and ultimately entered into a settlement with the NYPD. Under
the terms of the settlement, the police could not conduct sweeps of
Clean Halls buildings in which they forced everyone present to provide
identification. Instead, police could only approach people when they
already had some evidence that the person was trespassing in the
building or committing some other crime. In other words, these groups
had to sue the NYPD in order to force officers to follow ordinary
constitutional rules. The settlement also required police to keep
records about every person they stop or frisk near a Clean Halls
buildings---something that will allow more scrutiny of police behavior
in the future. But before the lawsuit forced the program to change, tens
of thousands of people were swept up into the criminal justice system.
Between 2007 and 2012, the NYPD made at least 16,000 trespassing arrests
every year under Operation Clean Halls. Many of the cases were dismissed
by judges or weren't prosecuted by district attorneys. But more than 60
percent of Clean Halls arrests ended either in a guilty plea or another
unfavorable disposition for the person arrested. We don't know how many
of the thousands of people arrested in Operation Clean Halls were
innocent or how many of those innocent people pleaded guilty. But
David's stories make clear that the burden of the court process itself
caused at least some innocent defendants to plead guilty. At the end of
our conversation about James and his other clients, I asked David: Why
couldn't he have gotten James's charges dismissed without making James
come back to court and miss another day of work? Why couldn't James just
send David a copy of his ID and then have David show up at the next
court date without James to provide that evidence to the judge and the
prosecutor in order to get the case dismissed? David explained that
James was legally required to appear at the next court date. The default
rule in criminal cases is that defendants have to show up for all court
dates---even the ones when nothing is going to happen and the lawyers
are just going to set another date for the next status update. [In an
incredibly small number of cases, David had been able to convince the
judge to allow the defendant to "waive" his appearance at the next court
date when the case was clearly just going to be dismissed]{.underline}.
But [it was "**stunningly rare**" how often judges were actually willing
to do that]{.underline}. David sighed as he noted, "[[There was]{.mark}
**absolutely [no recognition]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the actors in [the
system about]{.mark} [the]{.mark} level of [inconvenience for]{.mark}
all of the [people caught up in the]{.mark}
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}." \* \* \* \* \* It is very important to
understand the plea bargaining dynamic in misdemeanor cases because most
criminal cases are misdemeanor cases. But studying misdemeanor cases can
be difficult because state and local governments do not keep
particularly good records of misdemeanors. Until recently, we didn't
even have a good estimate of how many misdemeanor cases are filed in the
country. Law professor Alexandra Natapoff undertook the difficult task
of combining data from across the country and found that there are
approximately 13 million misdemeanor cases filed every year. Those cases
can range from serious criminal behavior like domestic violence to
trivial misconduct like littering. Because misdemeanors make up 80
percent of all criminal cases in the country, most of the people who are
arrested and charged with a crime will be accused of committing a
misdemeanor. And [because misdemeanor offenses can be so trivial, any of
us might find ourselves charged with one]{.underline}. So it should
deeply concern all of us that those [people who are swept up in the
misdemeanor criminal justice system see the system itself as a form of
punishment]{.underline}. To be clear, the process can also look like
punishment in felony cases. People accused of felonies who are lucky
enough to be released pending trial also have to return to court time
after time. But that inconvenience doesn't drive plea bargaining in
felony cases---at least not serious felony cases---the same way that it
does in misdemeanor cases. In serious felony cases, defendants can't
risk going to trial because the stakes are too high. [In misdemeanor
cases, [defendants don't push for trials because the stakes are so
low]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike felony defendants, who face much more
severe sentences if they are convicted at trial than if they plead
guilty, the difference between a guilty plea and a conviction after
trial for a misdemeanor defendant is likely to be much, much smaller.
But while the difference in sentencing gives prosecutors a lot of
leverage in felony cases, the [similarity in sentences make the
punishment of the process more obvious]{.underline} and more important
[for misdemeanor]{.underline} [defendants]{.underline}. [Imagine a
misdemeanor defendant who is [facing a \$250 fine]{.mark} if she is
convicted at trial. She could avoid the fine if she is acquitted at
[trial]{.mark}, but it [will take]{.mark}]{.underline} anywhere between
three and [**[seven]{.mark}** [court visits]{.mark}]{.underline}
[before]{.underline} she will actually get that [trial]{.underline}.
[[It will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[set her back]{.mark}
[more]{.mark} than \$250 [in **transportation costs** and **lost
wages**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for her to attend all of the court
appearances]{.underline}---and [[she might]{.mark} even **[lose her
job]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} [missing]{.mark} so much
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}--- so [she is]{.underline} probably [better
off just pleading guilty right away]{.underline}. [[If she can make the
fine]{.underline}]{.mark} just [a]{.underline} little [bit [lower by
pleading guilty]{.mark}]{.underline} at arraignment, then [[it would
be]{.mark} even more **[irrational]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for her [to
insist on a]{.mark} [trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. David Jaros emphasized
that [the risk of losing their job isn't the only gamble that
misdemeanor defendants take]{.underline} [when]{.underline} their [cases
**drag on**]{.underline} for extended periods of time [awaiting
trial.]{.underline} [There is also the risk that [a defendant could miss
a court date or get arrested again]{.mark} for something else. If a
defendant misses a court date, then the judge will issue a warrant for
her arrest]{.underline}. And [if you are arrested]{.underline} when you
already have [charges pending]{.underline} on another case, [you usually
won't be released]{.underline} on the new case. As we know, defendants
who are incarcerated before trial feel enormous pressure to plead guilty
in order to be released. "So," David concluded, "[all of these things
**snowball** into creating a system that functions more around resolving
pleas rather than going to trial]{.underline}." That the stakes in
misdemeanor cases are lower does not mean that a misdemeanor conviction
has no effect on a person. Even if a defendant isn't going to go to jail
when she is convicted of a misdemeanor, there are still collateral
consequences associated with that conviction. For example, a misdemeanor
conviction can affect a person's eligibility to get a student loan or
live in public housing. A misdemeanor conviction can keep people from
getting a job at the many businesses that require a criminal background
check. It can even result in a person who is not a U.S. citizen being
deported. But those consequences seem smaller when compared to the costs
of the prolonged contact with the system while waiting for trial. [The
very act of being brought into the criminal justice system---even if you
are never convicted---can also have **severe**
consequences]{.underline}. [Defendants]{.underline} have [to miss school
or work to attend court dates, and so the defendants may perform poorly
in class or lose their jobs if they keep returning to court while
waiting for a trial]{.underline}. And an arrest record---even if the
arrest never turns into a conviction---is often used by landlords,
employers, and immigration officials when they make important decisions
about people's lives. It doesn't matter to these people outside of the
criminal justice system that the defendant wasn't convicted. As law
professor Eisha Jain has explained, these people use arrest records
because those records are relatively easy and inexpensive to find, and
because they think arrests are good proxies for the potential for
violence, unreliability, or instability. Because the difference is so
small between the consequences of a trial and the consequences of a plea
bargain, misdemeanor plea bargains might seem unimportant, especially
when you compare their outcomes to the outcomes in felony cases. But it
would be a mistake to ignore the problems that misdemeanor plea
bargaining causes. And it would be an even bigger mistake to ignore
misdemeanors when thinking about how to reform our system.

Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class," Basic Books,

Well, sort of. TODAY, EVERYONE ARRESTED FOR A FELONY OFFENSE IS ENTITLED
to a defense lawyer. Juvenile defendants and anyone facing jail after a
misdemeanor offense are also entitled to representation. That's a lot of
people. So many, in fact, that there aren't nearly enough lawyers to
help them all. [The [lawyers]{.mark} who do represent criminal
defendants must rely on plea bargaining, or they'd [**never** be able to
manage]{.mark} their own [caseloads.]{.mark}]{.underline} Put simply,
[defense lawyers **need** plea bargaining to **stay
afloat**]{.underline}. The US Supreme Court likes to tell states what to
do (e.g., "give everyone a lawyer") but not necessarily how to do it.
Naturally, this tends to create inconsistencies and confusion. For one
thing, when the Supreme Court decided Gideon, it didn't say who was
considered "poor enough" to get a court-appointed lawyer. That call is
usually made by the presiding judge and is based on a quick snapshot of
the defendant's resources. Sometimes defendants get a court-appointed
lawyer simply because they say they are  unemployed; sometimes they
don't get one because they own something as extravagant as a used
Volkswagen. I've had indigent status denied to a client on the basis of
their having just over \$200 in their commissary account. In case the
reader is unaware, \$200 is not enough to pay an attorney to undertake
representation for anything more serious than a ticket for jaywalking.
But the biggest logjam created by the Supreme Court is that it did not
tell states how they were to go about making lawyers appear out of thin
air for thousands upon thousands of low-income defendants created by the
post- Prohibition legislative frenzy. [[It]{.underline} [is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} [often [the case]{.mark} that [**dozens** of
lawyers are]{.mark} sitting in the audience [waiting]{.mark} to see if
the judge calls on them]{.underline}. When Powell was decided in the
1930s, overcriminalization and overpolicing were just finding their land
legs, and there weren't many lawyers doing indigent defense, let alone
entire agencies devoted to it. [When]{.underline} the
[Gideon]{.underline} opinion [was issued in the 1960s, there was barely
a drug war, SWAT teams weren't kicking down fifty thousand doors per
year, and prisons still had  some beds available]{.underline}. The
Supreme Court may have been naive about how wide the floodgates would be
opened by Powell and Gideon. One might reasonably wonder if today's more
conservative court would make the same decision or if they'd just say
"best of luck" to criminal defendants who can't afford lawyers. The
federal government, despite being a major player in racking up all these
criminal charges in the first place, has been virtually no help in
digging up defense lawyers over the last century. The states or, in a
few places, individual counties implement their own systems and pay the
freight. Sometimes the systems implemented are good. Often they are not
so good. One way that states and larger cities have complied with Gideon
is by creating separate [public defender agencies]{.underline}. But
these agencies exist to serve  the criminal class. As such, to say that
these agencies have [been marked as **low priority** by
politicians]{.underline} would be a dramatic understatement. One Supreme
Court justice wrote shortly after the Gideon decision that "the
successful implementation of \[public defense\] would require state and
local governments to appropriate considerable funds, something they have
not been willing to do."12 That was true then, and it is true now. In
the loveless marriage between the state and federal governments,
[[public defense is]{.mark} the ugly stepchild]{.underline}. In our
system, which values high numbers of convictions above all else, 
[**[underfunded]{.mark}** public defender offices are burdened with an
**insane** number of cases]{.underline}. [There is no widely accepted
standard for how many cases an attorney may take on, but it is widely
accepted that there is some limit, one beyond which [a lawyer]{.mark}
simply [cannot]{.mark} [provide decent
representation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Guidelines established by one
national group in 1973 suggested that [caseloads should  not exceed
**[150 felonies]{.mark}** or 400 misdemeanors per year,]{.underline} and
state bar associations have issued similarly modest guidelines.13 I can
almost hear [[public defenders]{.underline}]{.mark} cackling in
exasperated disbelief, because it is not uncommon for them to
[carry]{.underline} **[more than twice]{.underline}** [that
number]{.underline}. For example, a 2009 report found that [Minnesota
public defenders [carried]{.mark} loads of]{.underline} between seven
hundred and **[[eight hundred cases]{.underline}]{.mark}** for each
lawyer, on average. Public defenders in Utah reported having no more
than ten hours to work on any one case.14 One high-ranking public
defender calculated that [Missouri caseloads required attorneys to
dispose of one case every **6.6 hours**.]{.underline}15 And a public
defender in Knoxville, Tennessee, gave this frank testimony about his
office's one hundred cases per attorney, per week: "[There's \[**no
time**\]... to do any on-scene investigations. There's \[**no
time**\]... to do any contacting of \[police\] officers.... There's...
\[**no\] time** to interview any witnesses]{.underline}. You just go
into court \[, and\] you fly by the seat of your pants to see what you
can accomplish...."16 [As one observer notes, the once-lofty idea of a
constitutional right to counsel has been reduced to "a guarantee of
little more than a companion at arraignment.]{.underline}"17 [When times
get tough, [**indigent defense** is the **first** thing to face **budget
cuts** in]{.mark} just about [**every** state.]{.mark}]{.underline} That
means attorneys get laid off, and [the already **unbearable** caseload
for the existing workforce **worsens**]{.underline}. The financial
crisis of 2008 made sacrificial lambs of public defender agencies all
over the country: Minnesota cut more than twenty attorney positions,
Georgia cut more than forty, and one Florida county alone cut fifty
staff and attorney positions total.18 Once those funds are gone from the
budget, it's hard to convince legislators to give the money back, let
alone give those agencies what they really need to be fully functional.
To add insult to injury, [many [public defenders]{.mark} are paid so
**miserably** that they [have to work **second jobs**]{.mark} in
addition to the hundreds of clients they look after]{.underline}. [It is
not unheard of for a beleaguered public advocate to finish a twelve-hour
day]{.underline} of the most emotionally taxing work imaginable
[and]{.underline} [go right to driving an **Uber**]{.underline} for
another six hours. One Kentucky public defender told  his local
newspaper that "I never thought [I would be 30 years old driving
**pizzas** out after graduating from law school]{.underline}.... But you
have got to make ends meet." A Missouri public defender grimly admitted
that on his salary, "if you want to raise a family, buy a house and a
car, that's not going to happen."19 The dearth of resources given to
public defenders has given rise to a whole subgenre of case law, one in
which the public defense agencies have sued their own states for
additional resources, to get out of the cases they are in, or
both[.]{.underline} Some of the judges who preside over these cases seem
to get it. One opinion out of Louisiana raged at lawmakers: [Indigent
defense in New Orleans is unbelievable, **unconstitutional**, totally
lacking the basic professional standards of legal representation and a
**mockery** of what a criminal justice system should be in a western
civilized nation.]{.underline} Equally shocking is the Louisiana
legislature, which has known since 1972, [constitutional violations and
insufficient funding have plagued indigent defense]{.underline}, not
only in New Orleans, but also in other Louisiana parishes.
[The]{.underline}  Louisiana [legislature has allowed this **legal
hell** to exist]{.underline}, fester and finally boil over.20 But just
because a judge gets it doesn't mean a legislator will bother to write a
check for more resources, especially not for America's most politically
unpopular group: criminals. Of course, prosecutors' offices often don't
have the resources they need, either. Government work is still
government work, after all. But you won't find a district attorney in
America with less firepower than their public- defending counterparts.
In Harris County, Texas, which long held the title of "death penalty
capital of the world," the budget for prosecutors is more than  twice
the amount allotted for public defense. Harris County prosecutors get
thirty full-time investigators; appointed lawyers get none. In New
Orleans, public defenders are outnumbered three to one by prosecutors.
This is not just a problem in the South. One county in New Jersey has
double the number of attorney positions for prosecutors as for public
defenders and more than seven times the number of investigators. Nor are
you likely to find a prosecutor who is paid less than a public defender,
if you adjust for seniority. Then again, seniority is not a big factor;
most public defense agencies have enormously high turnover rates. I'll
delicately suggest that a broke, overworked prosecutor is different from
a broke, overworked public defender, for a lot of reasons. Chief among
these reasons is the simple fact that a prosecutor has more control over
their caseload. If they don't want to prosecute more cases, they can
dismiss them or simply decline to prosecute (although this of course
could get a deputy  prosecutor in hot water with a chief who is obsessed
with high conviction tallies). In most jurisdictions a prosecutor's
workload is spread over more people, so it's unusual for them to be
carrying as many cases as a public defender. Another key difference is
that it's not usually a big deal if the prosecutor doesn't know the
facts of a case, but if a public defender can't tell their client's side
of the story, that's a problem. To paraphrase an old criminal lawyer's
adage, a prosecutor doesn't have to worry about whether or not their
client will go home at night. For a system that's supposed to be skewed
toward the criminal defendant (remember the "beyond a reasonable doubt"
standard we used to have?), ours doesn't read that way. The disparity in
resources between prosecutors  and public defenders demonstrates what
we've seen in previous chapters: criminals, or even people accused of
crimes, are treated as second-class citizens. So naturally, their
lawyers are treated as second-class lawyers, and the agencies that
employ them are treated as second-class agencies. [Public defenders are
expected to be experts in criminal law, take on totally **unmanageable**
caseloads]{.underline}, and then suffer the stigma common among
incarcerated people, the general public, and even private attorneys (who
should know better) of not being "real lawyers." The truth of the matter
is that "real lawyers" who practice criminal defense at private law
firms often aren't doing much better. The problem of the private bar is
essentially one of capitalism: [more cases means more pay. [Fewer cases
means less pay]{.mark}. So we want more cases. But if the cases don't
resolve quickly, then private lawyers, just like public defenders, can
get overloaded]{.underline}. The competition for cases is stiff,
especially in the world of what we call "blue-collar" crime: the thefts,
rapes, and murders of the world. As incomes continue to drop and
attorney fees continue to increase, it gets tougher to make a living
doing ordinary criminal work. [About [**95 percent** of]{.mark} all
criminal [defendants are]{.mark} now [represented by public
defenders]{.mark} or other appointed counsel.]{.underline}21 [[That
leaves only a **small wedge**]{.mark} of pie [for those]{.mark} [who
have private counsel]{.mark} and an even smaller wedge for "blue-collar"
criminals who can pay]{.underline}. Pressure to sign up as many cases as
possible and to resolve those cases as soon as possible is inevitable.
The example of Steven Vargas's lawyer at the beginning of this chapter
is an extreme one, to be sure. But [a lawyer taking on more cases than
they can realistically handle because they have bills to pay? That's
hardly out of the ordinary. Plea bargaining makes it
possible.]{.underline} In some areas, mostly rural ones, defense of the
poor is handled much the same as it was in the pre--Powell/Gideon days.
Cases are farmed out to a pool of private lawyers, who are appointed by
judges from a list (or just from off the top of the judge's head). This
arrangement creates fertile ground for ethical violations. Private
attorneys get paid slightly more per hour than a public defender might,
but the cases often quickly reach the cap that a state  will pay,
leaving the attorney with a busy private practice to maintain and a
handful of cases that no longer generate income. Unsurprisingly, not a
lot of lawyers are lined up to do this kind of work. I've done a fair
bit of indigent representation on contract with the ever-cash- strapped
state public defender's office in Kentucky. Those contracts currently
pay \$75 per hour, which may sound pretty good. And it is! But when you
stack it against a lawyer's regular rates, which tend to range anywhere
from  \$200 to \$500 hourly (in the Midwest and the South---the rates
can be much higher on either coast), it's hard to keep top talent
engaged in these cases: experienced lawyers have to look at this kind of
representation as a genuine public service. Add the fact that four or
five cases at a time max out at \$5,000 for all of the cases combined,
and you start to see the real problem with farming the cases out to
private counsel. [Those lawyers who factor state contracts into their
business models almost invariably end up biting off more than they can
chew.]{.underline} One Indiana lawsuit involved a lawyer in a rural
county who was assigned 176 unique felony cases and 32 unique
misdemeanor cases in one year alone. State guidelines say a private
lawyer can ethically handle only 75 felonies in a year on contract, but
that didn't stop the judge from continuing to appoint this lawyer, who
also had a full roster of paying clients. Of course, nearly all of his
cases ended up with guilty pleas; only two went to trial. But the
Indiana courts rubber-stamped this arrangement all the same, finding no
violation of anyone's rights.22 Ethical guidelines are just that:
guidelines. [Courts don't have to make anyone adhere to them and often
won't, if doing so would interfere with business as usual, even if that
business amounts to large-scale legal malpractice. [Lawyers]{.mark} who
take on those gargantuan caseloads [must pressure clients to take plea
deals]{.mark}, whether it's the right thing for the client or
not.]{.underline} There's no time for anything else. THERE IS ANOTHER
MAJOR INCENTIVE FOR A LAWYER TO GET  their client to take a plea deal:
criminal defense is hard. Over the years, in addition to an explosion in
criminal cases accompanied by a slow drain of money from the criminal
defense industry overall, the professional expectations placed on
defense lawyers have become daunting. Courts have radically altered
their Fourth Amendment jurisprudence since Gideon, which means knowing
when to file what motions to challenge what kind of evidence can be a
thorny affair. The American Bar Association and other professional
organizations  have continued to publish more-detailed guidelines every
few years, upping the ante for what is considered "competent"
representation. And courts have demonstrated impatience with
overburdened defense attorneys, even calling them out by name in
published opinions when they don't really deserve it. All this is
perhaps a good thing in the abstract. But in practice, it means a lot
more work for earnest defense lawyers who actually want to get it right.
The interviews I did for this section of the book were among the more
difficult because getting workaholic lawyers to sit still long enough
can be like trying to nail grape jelly to a beehive. When I did finally
talk to them, most of them have the capricious speech patterns of
someone who has had to relentlessly hop from case to case for years. I'm
telling on myself here, too. Having experienced it firsthand, I am
almost certain that a few years of running a high-volume practice does
something terrible to your brain. Although I'm not sure when it became
the norm for lawyers to work themselves to death (maybe it's always been
that way), it is certainly the norm now. It's practically a badge of
honor to take on more than you can possibly handle.  Good criminal
defense lawyers don't confine themselves to the courthouse, either. Like
cops, defense lawyers are expected to take on numerous roles that they
are not built for. They become social workers, addiction medicine
specialists, therapists, and more to their clients, filling voids that
legislatures can't be bothered with. It's no wonder the substance- abuse
rate among attorneys is astronomically high. Under those circumstances,
if a lawyer has the ever-present ability to take something off their
plate, they'll probably do it. Anyone would. A system of normalized plea
bargaining gives them that ability. The alternative is trial. And trials
themselves, especially now that very few of them ever happen, are a
briar patch. To be effective at something that might happen once or
twice a year, a would-be trial lawyer has to have  thousands of cases,
evidentiary rules, procedural rules, and local tricks of the trade
committed to memory. Trial lawyers also have to be good public speakers,
think quickly on their feet, be charming, and be appropriately
aggressive with difficult witnesses. Not only that, but they have to be
able to work twelve-hour days on one case, ignoring their families and
putting their other cases on hold for days, weeks, or even months at a
time. The opportunities for screwing up a trial are infinite, and trying
a case---while exhilarating---can be a tremendous pain. You'd have to be
a sociopath to  want to take every case to trial at the expense of your
client, your pocketbook, your kids, and your own sanity. In contrast, a
plea bargain takes only a few minutes, and there are no rules to
memorize. The courts make pleading as quick and painless as possible.
"Rocket-docket" or "meet-and-plead" systems, which are explicitly
designed to speed cases through, happen every week in courthouses all
over the country. Defendants show up, prosecutors give
shoot-from-the-hip offers, and dozens of cases are resolved
instantaneously. Karen Faulkner, a former public defender now in private
practice, describes a rocket-docket--type system as "a mechanism to
speed up the process of moving a felony to sentencing" in which "the
defense is required to show all their cards to the state without the
prosecutor having to tender or review discovery, speak to witnesses
outside of a police officer, or review the strength of their case (as
required under the ethical rules for prosecutors).... If the offer is
unfair and is rejected," the prosecution "has a policy to not make a
better offer" later on. "The process is very one-sided, making the
negotiations blind."23 Vince Aprile, the lawyer who represented the
defendant in Bordenkircher v. Hayes (discussed in the Introduction),
sums up speed pleading: "Prosecutors essentially say 'If you don't take
this deal, you're never gonna get a better deal when we go forward.'"24
Defense attorneys play along because it's the only way they can keep all
their cases in motion. Another thing: trials, unlike guilty pleas, are
subject to appeal. That's good news for the defendant, but for their
lawyer it means that the extensive record created by a trial might be
pored over by another defense attorney, another prosecutor, the court of
appeals itself, the media, and anyone else who might be interested in
looking at it. On the other hand, when a defendant forgoes a trial to
cop a plea, that means neither the public nor the higher courts will
ever see any police misconduct, any abuse of authority by prosecutors,
any failings by the defense attorney, the draconian sentences we hand
out every day, or the abject foolishness of the criminal statute
itself.  For defense lawyers, encouraging a client to take a plea deal
is a no- brainer. Imagine you think a client is guilty, and you have the
choice of (1) pleading early, (2) slogging through a year of work and
pleading guilty, or (3) slogging through a year of work, disappearing
into the hell of trial for a week, watching the jury returning with a
guilty verdict, and then having your work put under a microscope at the
court of appeals. Assuming you get paid no matter what, which one would
you choose?

The true costs of backlogs Agencies often struggle to get the funding
needed to fix their backlogs. After all, a backlog is an annoyance, but
is it really worth the effort to solve it? The problem with this
thinking is it ignores the opportunity costs of a backlog, which can be
significant for individuals, communities, and businesses. For example,
the US security clearance backlog, which peaked at over 700,000 cases in
2018,[^9^](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/government-backlog-reduction.html#endnote-9)
is a backlog with high opportunity costs. Each clearance case represents
an individual who needs access to classified information to do the job
right---but instead is unable to do so, or worse, is simply waiting for
clearance to be employed. According to a 2018 survey of cleared
personnel, jobs that required clearance had an average salary of about
US\$93,000.[^10^](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/government-backlog-reduction.html#endnote-10)
[The downstream effects of the backlog]{.underline}---in employment
terms alone---[are felt in lost labor market efficiency, forgone income,
and reduced tax revenues]{.underline} (not to mention the mission impact
of a shortage of qualified and cleared personnel). Many states face
backlogs in everything from human services to examining criminal
evidence. With some states facing a serious epidemic of opioid and
related drug abuse, a drug-evidence testing backlog can mean delayed
justice, which means police could release known drug dealers while they
wait on evidence. That means more dealers and traffickers on the street,
and more damage to
communities.[^11^](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/government-backlog-reduction.html#endnote-11)
The effects on communities can exacerbate backlogs in other state
systems---from children in foster care to state and local court systems
to elder care. And [[government backlogs]{.mark} can [reduce]{.mark} the
[attractiveness of investment and innovation in **entire**
economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Backlogs in court
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, can [[deter economic
investment by **increasing risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [especially for
foreign investors]{.underline}, and [[by enabling anti-competitive
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as [bogging down competitors in
endless lawsuits or violating agreements with impunity]{.underline}.
[Backlogs in developing economies in Asia, for example, are soaring,
with downstream effects for justice, growth, and long-term
development]{.underline}.[^12^](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/government-backlog-reduction.html#endnote-12)

Introduction [[No matter the issue]{.underline}]{.mark}---[whether it's
marriage equality, voting rights, health care, or
immigration]{.underline}---[[the U.S. federal courts play a **vital**
role]{.mark} in the lives of all Americans]{.underline}. There are two
types of courts: state and federal. The federal courts are those
established to decide disagreements that concern the Constitution,
congressional legislation, and certain state-based disputes. Although
most Americans are familiar with the lifetime appointment of justices on
the U.S. Supreme Court, many are surprised to learn that more than 900
judges have lifetime appointments to serve on lower federal courts,
where they hear many more cases than their counterparts on the Supreme
Court. Each year, the Supreme Court reviews around 100 of the most
significant cases out of the nearly 30 million cases resolved by state
and federal courts. [[These courts hear the majority of cases
and]{.mark}, most of the time, they [have the **final**
say]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[That is why]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with
the Supreme Court's justices, the judges who sit on [the nation's
[federal]{.mark} district and [circuit courts are so
important]{.mark}]{.underline}. At any given time, there are vacancies
on U.S. federal courts that need to be filled. [[If]{.mark} they are not
filled, [federal caseloads get **backlogged**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
as a result]{.underline}, [Americans' [access to justice is
limited]{.mark}.]{.underline} As of March 9, 2015, there were 50 current
vacancies on U.S. federal courts. These seats have been vacant for a
total of 22,222 days, resulting in a backlog of 29,892 cases. The
Administrative Office of the United States Courts has designated 23 of
these pending vacancies as judicial emergencies, meaning that filling
them is a critical task. As the Center for American Progress has noted,
"in practical terms," [[these]{.mark} are the [judicial
districts]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[where judges are overworked]{.mark}
and where [justice is being **significantly delayed**]{.mark} for the
American public]{.underline}." The Constitution dictates that the
president appoints federal judges while the Senate advises and consents
on these appointments. The result is a delicate balance between the
desires of the White House, deference to home-state senators, and the
power of the party that controls the Senate. Recently, politics has
played a big role in the pace at which judicial nominees are confirmed.
In an attempt to slow President Barack Obama's effect on the federal
courts, Senate Republicans have obstructed the president's judicial
nominees at unprecedented levels by attempting to prevent or delay a
vote through filibustering a record number of nominees and making them
await confirmation for long periods of time. The reason many Senate
Republicans have played politics with President Obama's judicial
nominees is because they know the dramatic impact the judiciary can have
on policies, including marriage equality and reproductive choice. The
fewer judges that President Obama appoints to fill federal judicial
vacancies, the greater leverage the next president will have in deciding
the make-up of these courts. Yet in the face of unprecedented
obstruction, President Obama has made great strides to fill vacancies
and to ensure that federal judges meaningfully reflect the dynamic
diversity of the nation. A diverse federal bench improves the quality of
justice and instills confidence that judges understand the real-world
implications of their decisions. Americans have different backgrounds,
as well as an assorted set of professional, educational, and life
experiences. It is important that the federal courts reflect the
diversity of the public they serve. As Supreme Court Justice Sonia
Sotomayor once wrote, "The dynamism of any diverse community depends not
only on the diversity itself but on promoting a sense of belonging among
those who formerly would have been considered and felt themselves
outsiders." Furthermore, scholars have found that judges often change
their minds during the deliberative process. In one study, researchers
concluded that having a woman on the panel affected "elements of both
deliberation and bargaining---alternative perspectives, persuasive
argument, and horse trading." Not only do [[the federal courts play a
**vital role in preserving democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but who
sits on the courts has an effect too. [This issue brief examines the
ways in which our federal courts influence important policy issues and
illustrates how judges' decisions are often aligned with the legal
philosophy of the presidents who appoint them. This fact drives home one
of the reasons why courts matter: The decisions of federal judges have
repercussions on people's lives. Through its review of how the federal
courts affect three specific policy issues---gun violence, money in
politics, and voting rights---this issue brief shines a light on how
important the federal courts are for the progressive community.]{.mark}

Retirement accounts for many of the judicial vacancies across the
nation, but other factors, including increased politicization of
judicial appointments and returns to private practice also contribute to
judicial shortages. Furthermore, younger judges are being appointed who
are more likely to resign before meeting the Rule of 80, the federal law
that requires judges age plus years of service on the bench equal 80
before eligible for Senior Status caseload reductions or retirement.
Combined with the expectation of public scrutiny and hostility directed
toward judges, [oppressive caseloads, politicization and persistent
under-resourcing, it is no surprise judges are leaving the
bench]{.underline} and the judiciary is experiencing the same challenges
with recruitment and retention the other sectors of public service. 
Impact of Judicial Backlog  For state and county governments a
**[[judicial backlog]{.underline}]{.mark}** is more than a mere
inconvenience. In criminal cases, it [means people accused crimes may
spend more time in pretrial detention. Victims and witnesses may
experience emotional trauma]{.underline} from lengthy delays that
[impede]{.underline} physical and emotional [healing.]{.underline} On
the civil side of the law, delays in resolving business disputes can
have economic repercussions that hinder economic activities and growth.
For circumstances where judicial intervention may be required, [[delays
can be **emotionally devastating** to individuals who await civil
resolution of cases]{.mark} involving child custody and divorce.
[Backlogs in state and local courts cause both up- and downstream
impacts that exacerbate challenges with government resource allocation,
budget and fiscal stability.]{.mark}]{.underline} Finally, and perhaps
more importantly, [workplace disruption caused by backlog]{.underline}
and other circumstances [may cause judges to be prone to poor
application of the law.]{.underline} Like everyone else, when faced
[with backlogs and increasing workload, [judges and magistrates may
**rush** to decisions without]{.mark} full [considerations of]{.mark}
the [merits]{.mark} of each case [and impartial application of
law.]{.mark}]{.underline} In other words, because they are human, [[they
can make **mistakes** that have **deleterious** consequences for]{.mark}
the [**millions** of people]{.mark} and businesses who seek their
help.]{.underline}   Solutions  This is not a problem that money alone
can solve. While better funding may help, it doesn't resolve caseloads
that for some jurisdictions have increased by upwards of 30 percent in
recent years, nor does it adequately address the combined impacts of
fewer qualified candidates who seek a high stress judgeship with a
relentless workload. To solve these problems, particularly at the local
and state level, a new range of solutions are needed. Some are
legislative, others are administrative, and together they may be
practical:

Case backlogs significantly impact the judicial system. By delaying the
proceedings, case backlogs increase the cost of litigation. [When a case
is backlogged, parties---especially those that cannot afford to wait or
pay for protracted litigation---are incentivized to accept less than
optimal settlements. [**Backlogs** also **force** criminal
defendants,]{.mark} who cannot afford bail, [to spend]{.mark} a
[greater]{.mark} amount of [time in jail before a determination of their
guilt can occur.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, [[backlogs]{.mark} can
[**stymie** justice by **delaying** trials until after witnesses
or]{.mark} even [parties have passed away.]{.mark}]{.underline}  Courts
across the United States have experienced backlogs for quite some time.
Between 2000 and 2014, thousands of civil cases were backlogged in U.S.
District Courts each year, and this trend has only continued into the
2020s. For example, as of 2020, the number of backlogged cases in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey sat at a staggering
39,000, up over 230% since 2016. In the administrative law courts of the
Department of Health and Human Services, hundreds of thousands of
Medicare appeals were backlogged during the 2010s. Similarly, the
nation's immigration court has faced severe backlogs for more than a
decade. Concerningly, the immigration court's backlog has grown at an
exceptionally rapid pace. Back in 2012, only 318,832 immigration cases
were backlogged. By 2019, the backlog had ballooned to over one million
cases. Unfortunately, this problem is not limited to federal courts. In
2019, county and municipal courts faced an average backlog of 828 cases.
That same year, state courts experienced an even greater backlog with an
average of 1,030 cases backlogged per court.  The effects of COVID--19
have only exacerbated the nation's backlogs. By suspending jury trials
and in-person proceedings in response to the pandemic, local, state and
federal courts have expanded their backlogs. In regards to the former,
the pandemic has caused state and local court backlogs to increase on
average by about thirty three percent. In Texas, the pandemic has
created statewide backlogs that are projected to take three to five
years to clear. Similarly, Georgia's pandemic backlog is projected to
last for at least three years. Meanwhile, in Florida, the backlog count
has grown to over one million cases since the beginning of the pandemic.
In New York City, the backlog of criminal cases has grown by
approximately one third since the start of the pandemic. Following the
outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern District
of California and the District of Arizona declared judicial emergencies
in order to respond to their worsening backlogs.  In order to reduce the
backlogs, legislatures should expand the nation's courts. By
establishing new judgeships at local, state and federal levels, more
cases can be resolved each year. Although the expansions would require
sizeable financial appropriations, the potential benefits would not be
insignificant. Based on data from 2020, each new United States District
Judge would be able to terminate an average of 527 cases each year. 
After weighing the costs and benefits of expanding the courts, several
governing bodies have already begun to recruit extra judges to reduce
their backlogs. As of July 2021, one Texas county unanimously decided to
appropriate funds in order to hire three visiting judges. In
Massachusetts, the state government rehired 15 retired judges to address
their case backlog. In an effort to respond to their state's backlog,
the Wyoming state legislature is debating a bill that would establish
additional judgeships. While Congress has authorized the recruitment of
415 more immigration judges to address the immigration court's backlog,
they have yet to expand the nation's district courts. Hopefully, that
will soon change.   

#### Longer cases mean more humiliation, lost wages, and denial of access to education, jobs, housing, and credit. These are all independent of whether someone is convicted

Georgia School of Law, 2022, "Bargaining for Abolition," Fordham Law

To extend the assembly line metaphor, if police place the person
arrested on a conveyor belt, then prosecutors crank the pulley, keeping
the process in motion to eventually ensure that a judge imposes some
kind of penal discipline down the line.24 Legal adjudication moves the
conveyor belt forward---that is, in order for the defendant to progress
from one stage to the next, a judge needs to issue a legal ruling. The
process only moves forward by compelling the accused's appearance,
either by the threat of or by actual physical coercion in the form of
pretrial detention. Prosecutors perform the lion's share of the
adjudicative labor, making them the system's most powerful actors.25
Their charging decisions orchestrate the path of the case. Prosecutors
determine whether a case will go to trial or be resolved with a plea.26
One labor-saving maneuver that prosecutors consistently deploy is to
charge the defendant with the highest possible offense to secure a plea
and avoid a labor-intensive trial.27 But they do not work simply to
extract convictions. Professor Issa Kohler-Hausmann shows that assistant
district attorneys in New York City use their charging power to bring
the urban underclass under court supervision.28 The district attorneys'
offices in New York City tend to assign quality-of-life cases to their
new recruits, where they learn their craft by practicing on the lives of
Black and Latinx New Yorkers. 29 The cases are often indistinguishable
from one another; their pleadings mirror the boilerplate language in the
police paperwork, which is itself reflective of the stubborn persistence
of police quotas.30 Kohler-Hausmann shows that [district attorneys'
offices pursue cases despite the fact that few will result in
convictions]{.underline}. 31 Some cases will even be dismissed by design
or by neglect.32 But [[the cost of processing the case is displaced
onto]{.mark} [defendants]{.mark} who each have to return to court
multiple times]{.underline}. For defendants[, [it means
**repeated**]{.mark} court dates, [lost wages, and]{.mark} lost
[time]{.mark} [that court actors **systematically
devalue**]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 [For each court date, [to enter these
courtroom's physical spaces]{.mark}, [nonlawyers must endure a set of
**humiliating**]{.mark} **[rituals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Every
morning, even before the session begins, [a long line of people with
court dates hugs the corner of the building]{.underline}---in rain,
snow, or shine.34 [The patient attendees wait, only to be greeted by
court officers guarding the cold metal detectors]{.underline}. After
they take off their outer garments and empty their pockets, [those with
court dates can expect a brisk pat down]{.underline}. Then, the
interminable wait begins, before the court officer finally announces
their cases. And, as prosecutors progress through their thick piles of
case files, [defendants endure repeated trips to court until their case
is finally closed]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [[as the case is pending, the
defendant's life hangs in the balance]{.mark}: even [the seemingly
benign mark of an open criminal case is apparent to employers,
landlords, creditors, and school admissions officers who are given
**cause** to **deny** a hopeful application]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 When
it finally comes down to resolving the case, prosecutors determine the
ultimate disposition for quality-of-life offenses, based not on the
strength of the case but rather on the accused's misfortune of being
previously arrested for something else.36 Although prosecutors are the
most powerful violence workers in criminal court, they tend to minimize
the amount of power they exercise over people's lives, "placing that
responsibility onto other systems out of or beyond their control."37 The
defense attorney has an ambiguous relationship to this violence work. At
their most powerful, defense attorneys can slow down the conveyor belt
and create off-ramps to mitigate the work of their adversaries. However,
defense attorneys cannot expect to disrupt the entire operation through
their legal practice. At worst, the defense attorney legitimizes
carceral control by providing the illusion of due process. 38
Prosecutors, as they apply the criminal law, narrow the court's
attention to the singular individual act. Their prerogative to blame
obfuscates the conditions outside of the individual's control that makes
criminalization almost inevitable.39 Prosecutors blindfold themselves to
the structural conditions that shape who the police place on the
assembly lines. But their adherence to the myth of personal
responsibility conflicts with the evidence. Sociologists ascribe urban
interpersonal violence, like homicide, to conditions of extreme
segregation.40 But criminal law focuses primarily on the person who
pulls the trigger. Even when prosecutors consider mitigation, they still
operate within the bounds of retributive justice, applying the
defendant's social history as a discount against the accused's
blameworthiness.41 Their work minimizes state failure and emphasizes
personal responsibility. Indeed, prosecutors are the cult of personal
responsibility's most faithful practitioners. This methodological
individualism entrenches group-level differences. In Chicago's Cook
County, sociologist Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve captures the tenor of the
conversation between courtroom insiders as they negotiate case
resolutions.42 Van Cleve shows how the discourse of crime and its
attendant discourse of personal responsibility serves as the civil way
to launder discussions of racial hierarchies in racially neutral ways.43
Defendants' ascribed personal characteristics feature prominently. 44
Van Cleve traces the logical and linguistic slippages in courtroom
actors' negotiations: the defendant's poverty becomes ascribed to their
laziness.45 A past trauma solicits fear rather than empathy.46 The
lawyers broker deals by trading on pseudosociological tropes: broken
families, absent fathers, and dependent mothers.47 White courtroom
insiders awkwardly appropriate African-American vernacular to speak
about Black defendants.48 These ways of speaking parallel the pervasive
racial discrimination that taints every aspect of the court system. 49
In this way, criminal legal processes play a critical role in
constructing racial hierarchy. Prosecutors and judges reserve their more
punitive criminal court sanctions for Black defendants, all other things
being equal, particularly in drugs and weapons prosecutions and in the
juvenile justice system. 50 The latter has the effect of "creating a
cumulative record of disadvantage over the life course."51 Other
state-produced vulnerabilities become liabilities in court. Criminal
courts are public institutions that almost exclusively regulate the poor
and the working class.52 This is not a coincidence: policy makers in the
1970s anticipated prison constructions based on the number of men who
were unemployed.53 Yet, despite the overrepresentation of poor people in
criminal court, being poor systematically disadvantages defendants and
undermines their cases in court.54 Court fines and fees, incarceration,
and lost wages further immiserate defendants.55 Criminal courts'
processes and the punishment that they dispense also frequently
weaponize expressions of neurodivergence, transforming neurocognitive
differences into disabilities.56 Criminal courts' violence is thus not
just physical but also structural.57 To borrow scholar Ruth Wilson
Gilmore's formulation, the criminal punishment system's practitioners
"exploit and renew fatal power-difference couplings."58 Gilmore
elaborates: "There is no difference without power, and neither power nor
difference has an essential moral value. Rather, the application of
violence---the cause of premature deaths---produces political power in a
vicious cycle." 59 Gilmore draws attention to the legal and extralegal
processes, such as racism, ableism, and classism that produce
group-level hierarchies.60 Criminal procedure participates in these
processes, exploiting and reconstructing differences that stratify
individuals with life-altering consequences.61 The criminal punishment
system shortens people's lives and inflicts psychological and emotional
pain.62 Criminal law's physical and structural violence weakens social
bonds. But that disintegration is also a cause: it is precisely the lack
of social solidarity that makes this multidimensional violence possible.
When prosecutors make charging decisions, they stigmatize defendants as
blameworthy and castigate them as unruly, harmful, or dangerous. They
inherently assign value to persons and behaviors, identifying who
deserves our collective wrath and who merits our solidarity. Their
adjudication instructs not only those directly entangled in criminal
courts but also the public at large. Criminal law's practitioners engage
in physical, structural, and social violence: they force people into
cages or, at least, they threaten to; they exacerbate and reconfigure
group-level differences that put those who are criminalized at a
distance from the levers of social, economic, and political power; and
they undermine social solidarity by erecting fault lines between guilty
and innocent.63 Taking a step back and opening the aperture, criminal
courts' workers communicate lessons about who and what society ought to
value. These moral lessons are not always explicit or consistent, and
they exist only in human action. In turn, to erect a different theory of
value would thus require criminal court actors to perform their work
differently, or to stop altogether. II. L ABOR AS MATERIAL INPUT

Introduction: Foucault's genealogy of the prison In Discipline and
Punish (1977), Foucault does not so much argue that incarceration
produces recidivism as point out that this fact has been known since the
birth of the prison (Foucault, 1977: 252--253, 265, 270--272, 276--
284). We have long known that punishment does not deter and prisons do
not rehabilitate. On the contrary, prisons produce criminals and thus
more crime. Incarceration leads to situations of isolation from society
and feelings of anti-sociality in those incarcerated, and simultaneously
socializes offenders into a criminal milieu. Moreover, [prisons deprive
families and communities of parents and wage earners, leading to more
crimes arising from poverty and familial and community
dysfunction]{.underline}. Contemporary critical prison studies scholars
such as Michelle [Alexander]{.underline} (2011) have
[demonstrated]{.underline} that the manners in which [offenders continue
to be punished, restricted and regulated post-incarceration in
countries]{.underline} such as the US [leaves many former prisoners with
few options other than to return to prison.]{.underline} Foucault offers
more theoretical variations on these critiques of the prison, observing
that [the introduction of the discourses and activities of [the
psychological sciences]{.mark} [in]{.mark}to [the]{.mark} criminal
[trial]{.mark}]{.underline} and the prison [[provided an
opportunity]{.mark} not simply to punish a prisoner's body, but also
[to]{.mark} categorize, observe and [refashion their]{.mark}
[soul]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Prisoners are]{.mark} constructed as
[objects of knowledge for criminology, psychiatry and
psychology]{.mark}, which predict their likelihood to reoffend and
suggest further disciplinary measures based on this prediction, such as
extended or reduced periods of incarceration and various forms of
probation and post-incarceration surveillance]{.underline}. For
Foucault, [[the]{.mark} [production of 'objective' knowledge about
criminals objectifies these human beings]{.mark}, producing the very
objects and realities that are then known and acted upon]{.underline}.
For all these reasons, prisons are not merely ineffective at preventing
crime but also counterproductive, to the extent that it would be better
for crime prevention to have no criminal justice system at all than to
perpetuate the system we have (Davis, 2003: 105). As legal scholar
Nicola Lacey puts it, the uselessness of prisons as a means of crime
control is a 'frequently rediscovered insight' (Lacey, 2011: 18). The
subtitle of Discipline and Punish is 'birth of the prison', but to what
prison does Foucault refer? On the one hand, clearly he is providing a
genealogy of the prison in the sense of physical institutions of
confinement. At the same time, Discipline and Punish provides a
genealogy of the modern soul -- the disciplined soul, which, he argues,
is another kind of prison, or another way in which bodies are kept
docile. Foucault (1977) thus shows that [the]{.underline}
[prison]{.underline} both monitors and produces souls, but it does not
produce the penitent souls that were anticipated by the original
advocates of penitentiaries; rather, it [produces delinquent souls that
almost inevitably lead these bodies back to prison]{.underline}. So, as
Foucault makes clear, the prison fails spectacularly at rehabilitating
prisoners and thus prison is 'dangerous when it is not useless'
(Foucault, 1977: 232). Although the failure of prisons to rehabilitate
is important to note, Foucault insists that [we must move beyond such
naïve reiterations of familiar criminological facts]{.underline} and ask
what prisons are doing well, such that biopolitical states do not dream
of doing without them. For him, [it cannot be the case that the failure
of the prison to deter crime or to rehabilitate prisoners simply has not
yet registered with the powers that be, or that we merely need to
demonstrate these facts again]{.underline}. Such [demonstrations have
been ineffective for **200 years**]{.underline} for a reason: [[the
prison must]{.mark} in fact [be]{.mark} effectively serving purposes
that make it [**indispensable** to the biopolitical
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to explain what the prison is doing
well, it is necessary to understand the ways in which sovereign power
was failing in the punitive realm, such that a disciplinary response to
crime -- embodied by the birth of the prison -- was appealing in the
first place. Foucault (1977) argues that [under sovereign]{.underline}
power, crimes were viewed as offences against the sovereign rather than
against their immediate crime victims. Punishment was conceived as the
reassertion of the sovereign's power rather than the repaying of a debt
to one's victim or to society. The people were not seen as the ones on
whose behalf punishment took place, but as compulsory spectators of the
bloody rites through which the sovereign reasserted his power. [The
population was not meant to feel vindicated or protected by the
punishment of lawbreakers, but rather awed by the display of the
sovereign's might]{.underline}. The result of this approach to
punishment was that people often felt sympathy for the condemned and
outrage at the excesses of the sovereign's violence. [In
contrast]{.underline}, [[disciplinary power]{.mark} [is]{.mark} more
likely to be supported by the population because it is [packaged
as]{.mark} [the paying of a debt]{.mark} [to and protection of
society]{.mark}, and we are more likely to support [an]{.mark}
[effort]{.mark} **[made on our own behalf]{.mark}** than one aimed at
terrorizing or subduing us]{.underline}. Thus, while the punitive
spectacles of sovereign power frequently backfired by giving rise to
revolt, popular manifestations of resistance have been relatively rare
since the rise of the prison. Beyond this, sovereign power was
ineffective because it punished relatively few bodies. [Disciplinary
power]{.underline}, in contrast, [targets all bodies and]{.underline},
more importantly, [all souls]{.underline}. Significantly, we are less
likely to resist a form of power that has already constituted who we
are. [The [effectiveness]{.mark} of discipline [lies in the]{.mark}
[fact]{.mark} that [we are]{.mark} [unlikely to recognize our
self-formations]{.mark} and intuitions [as the products]{.mark} [of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We thus accept contingent norms that are
the product of disciplinary normalization as both universal and common
sense]{.underline}. For example, although what is considered a crime as
well as how criminals are perceived is contingent and socially
constructed, [[we have internalized a pathologizing and fearful]{.mark}
[understanding of criminals]{.mark}, most of [whom are]{.mark} not
violent or dangerous, but the **[victims of
poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline} and racial profiling, whose acts may not
have been criminal in another time and place. However, [the idea that
crime entails violence and wrongdoing, and thus that criminals should be
feared and mistrusted, is normative today]{.underline}, and we do not
usually resist what we have internalized as a norm. In short, [even if
disciplinary power -- exemplified by the prison -- fails to deter crime
or to protect society, it remains desirable to the biopolitical state
because it produces a population that is extraordinarily **submissive**
to the criminal punishment system]{.underline}. Foucault (1977) also
notes that because the punishments were so extreme in the law codes
under sovereign power, judges were not willing to enforce the laws
consistently. Thus, justice could also be irregular because the judges
themselves were not willing to be consistent, and therefore the
punishments and laws of sovereign power were not enforced. All this made
the exercise of sovereign power highly sporadic: sometimes it was
applied according to the letter of the law and then people might revolt
in sympathy for those being mutilated or killed for petty crimes such as
larceny, while in other cases the law was not enforced because it was
too severe and thus there was no certainty of punishment. In contrast,
with disciplinary power, punishments are lighter and therefore judges
are consistently willing to enforce them. Foucault writes that penal and
legislative reform aimed 'to make of the punishment or repression of
illegalities a regular function ... Not to punish less but to punish
better; to punish with an attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to
punish with more universality and necessity' (Foucault, 1977: 82).
Although popular resistance occurs far less often under disciplinary
power than under sovereign power, [when [people]{.mark} do
[revolt]{.mark}]{.underline}, resist and riot in the streets against the
exercise of the state's power to punish today, [it is]{.underline}
largely [[in]{.mark} cases where [capital punishment]{.mark} ([a remnant
of]{.mark} [sovereign power]{.mark}]{.underline}) still [exists or is
[exercised by]{.mark} the [police]{.mark} [and]{.mark} in instances
[where punishment is applied]{.mark} inconsistently and thus
[unjustly]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, in the US, [[there are
protests]{.mark} when people are about to be legally executed, [when
police execute unarmed Black people]{.mark} and when high-profile court
decisions are blatantly racist.]{.underline} Thus, [resurgences of
[sovereign power, seen]{.mark} [in **irregular**, **severe** and
**biased** punishments]{.mark}, still [give rise to rebellion]{.mark}
[in a way that]{.mark} [routine prison sentences]{.mark} typically [do
not]{.mark}]{.underline}. Foucault observes in Discipline and Punish
that penal reformers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries suggested
a variety of approaches to punishment other than prison. For instance,
one proposal was that punishments should match crimes: a thief would
lose his hand; a poisoner would be scalded with boiling liquid; and a
murderer would be executed. The only criminals who would be punished by
being put into prison would be those who had deprived someone else of
their liberty, such as kidnappers. Yet these ideas for penal reform
never had traction, whereas the prison soon came to seem 'self-evident'
and even 'natural'. Although the problems with the prison were quickly
recognized, the 'self-evident' aspect of prisons remained. As Foucault
(1977: 232) writes: 'It is the detestable solution, which one seems
unable to do without.' But why can we not imagine doing without the
prison? Why does it seem self-evident when we know that it is but a 200-
year-old invention? First and foremost, Foucault (1977) thinks that
[[the prison seems **selfevident**]{.mark} to us today because it is an
extension of the pervasive structure of society]{.underline}. [We live
in a disciplinary, carceral society and the prison is simply a more
extreme disciplinary and carceral space than those of our regular lives.
The prison thus seems natural to us because [it is a]{.mark} mere
[intensification of]{.mark} what we have been habituated to in all the
other institutions in which we are formed and trained]{.underline}
(Foucault, 1977: 233). Thus, in the final chapter of Discipline and
Punish, Foucault asks why we accept being punished, and being punished
for such minor offences. In response, he suggests that [we do so because
we are habituated to [disciplinary power]{.mark}]{.underline} as it
extends from gentle to draconian forms, [from parental discipline
through schools, hospitals, workplaces, the army and on to
prisons]{.underline}. Beyond this, [prisons]{.underline} seem
self-evident because, compared to other punishments, [they are perceived
as egalitarian and democratic]{.underline}. Moreover, [prisons are
understood as economic and moral; prison terms are a means of 'paying
one's debt to society', and the debt is calculated in terms of time
served]{.underline}. This economic approach to punishment seems fair and
consonant within a capitalist worldview. Finally, [[prisons
were]{.underline}]{.mark} at least originally [[conceived as
therapeutic]{.mark} and thus penal [reformers could assure]{.mark}
themselves that their [punishments reflected a **civilized** and
**humane**]{.mark} [society]{.mark} in which we do not hurt
[wrongdoers]{.mark}, but merely [deprive]{.mark} them of their
[liberty]{.mark} in order [to help them to help
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. However readily we may contest each of
these perceptions of the prison, carceral institutions have proved
palatable because they conform not only to capitalist values, but also
to our self-perception in Western democracies as egalitarian, civilized
and humane. Foucault (1977) discusses another reason why prisons have
come to seem inevitable. This is that [prisons are sites of knowledge
production]{.underline}. As Foucault argues in works such as The Order
of Things and The History of Sexuality, modernity is [characterized by
the]{.underline} invention of human sciences and the desire to know
ourselves. The French title of Foucault's The History of Sexuality is La
volonté de savoir: The **[Will to Know]{.underline}**. Modernity is
unique in this desire to know the knower, especially in its
'problematic' forms. Foucault's 'will to know' is a play on Nietzsche's
'will to power', and the will to know about 'problematic' human kinds is
caught up in a will to power insofar as we want to know about these
human kinds to control or transform them. In the case of criminality, a
great deal of knowledge is now considered necessary not only about
crimes but also, more importantly, about criminals, as is most evident
in the 19th-century invention of criminology. According to Foucault
(1977), [[criminological knowledge is considered]{.mark}
**[necessary]{.mark}** today both to judge and to punish lawbreakers.
The prison is in some ways the ideal place for deriving knowledge about
criminals, both as individuals and as types. Carceral institutions are
panoptic, providing the perfect opportunity for total observation of the
human kinds housed there. However. the idea that prisons, and other
panopticons, give us objective knowledge about human kinds must be
qualified in a significant way]{.underline}. For Foucault (1977), what
is observed in prison is the 'delinquent', which is different from the
agent of a crime. Agents are understood as having free will or autonomy,
as having chosen to act as they did. Delinquents, on the other hand, are
approached more in the way that zoologists study nonhuman animals: in
terms of drives or tendencies that determine how they will behave.
Foucault (1977: 253) thus refers to the production of knowledge in
prisons as 'a zoology of social sub-species'. Unfortunately,
criminologists have the same problems that zoologists have when they
observe animals in captivity: the animals frequently self-mutilate,
self-starve or otherwise harm themselves, each other and their keepers,
go mad or die from broken hearts, stress and despair in their cages
(Jamieson, 2002). Zoos are not actually good sites for zoological
observation because the animals do not generally survive as well as they
do in the wild and they do not behave 'naturally'; zoos, like laboratory
cages, make captive animals go insane. Thus, [one does not learn much
about animal behaviour when one puts animals in a setting of captivity
that is traumatizing, unnatural and depressing to them]{.underline}. In
the same way, [social]{.underline} and 'psy' [scientists do not learn
much about the human animals they observe in prisons other than how
captivity crushes and deranges them]{.underline}. It is in the chapter
entitled 'Illegalities and Delinquencies' that we see that Foucault
(1977) is a prison abolitionist, even though he never clearly described
himself as such. The chapter's title suggests [a shift from illegal acts
to a kind of identity: the identity of the delinquent, a being for whom
criminality is a way of being. Such a subject is nearly bound to
reoffend in virtue of who they have been constructed to be]{.underline}.
Prisons, in producing delinquents, result not in safer communities, but
in more crime. Yet, as Foucault argues, the proposed solution to this
glaring problem with prisons has never been to do away with these
institutions, but has always been more prison. Foucault describes a kind
of cycle in which the failure of the prison always leads to extensions
of the prison, with the prison always 'offered as its own remedy'
(Foucault, 1977: 268). In contrast, for Foucault [[the solution to
prison is not]{.mark} [prison reform]{.mark}. [If prison is the problem,
then more prison is never going to be the solution]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In rejecting prison reform, Foucault is taking an abolitionist stance.
What, though, does Foucault think would be a better way of responding to
crime? Although Foucault never spells out an answer to this question, in
Discipline and Punish he does make it clear that the actual cause of
what gets socially constructed as crime is usually poverty (Foucault,
1977: 276). Thus, it would follow for him that if we really wanted to
fight 'crime' effectively, we would strive for a more egalitarian
society. He would thus have advocated for redistributive responses to
social harms. Instead, however, we continue to pour resources into
policing and prisons in the full knowledge that this merely leads to
more poverty and thus more crime. It is remarkable to Foucault that,
[having long been aware that the prison and its disciplinary practices
fail in their proclaimed goal of rehabilitating criminals, we have never
seriously considered abolishing the prison]{.underline}. Rather,
[[critiques of the prison lead only to prison reform and]{.mark} to an
extension of [the logic of the prison]{.mark}; the antidote to the
problems of the prison has always been more prison]{.underline}. Indeed,
since Foucault wrote Discipline and Punish, the prison has not only seen
a colossal expansion, particularly in the US, but many of these
disciplinary practices of the penal system have been intensified. This
is most obvious in strategies of community notification, police
registration, and periods of probation and parole involving scheduled
and unscheduled visits from surveillance officers and parole officers as
well as mandated 'therapeutic' treatments. The irony for Foucault is
that these disciplinary measures do not so much fashion the subject away
from their crime as constitute them in terms of it. Since it has been
known all along that prisons produce rather than rehabilitate
delinquents, yet we continue to build and fill more prisons, Foucault
thinks we must return to the question that has structured critical
prison studies since Discipline and Punish was first published in French
in 1975: what are the true functions of the prison such that it is in
fact not a failure but a success? What is really at stake in the prison
such that, despite its well-known recidivist-producing effect, it
maintains its apparently unquestionable appeal? What is the prison doing
well such that it is indispensable to the biopolitical state? Foucault
provides a series of answers to these questions, suggesting that [[the
production of]{.mark} [delinquents serves the]{.mark} political and
economic [interests of the]{.mark}]{.underline} middle and [[upper
classes at the expense of the poor]{.mark}, who are those overwhelmingly
incarcerated]{.underline}. In the contemporary context, Ruth Wilson
Gilmore (2007) has described the ways in which [the prison system serves
as [a capitalist]{.mark} [response to **surplus labour**]{.mark}. [The
prison industry has **vested** financial interests in]{.mark} the
construction of delinquency]{.underline}. Many rural communities near to
which prisons have been built are now dependent on staffing and
supplying prisons for their existence (Davis, 2003; Kutchins and
Galloway, 2007). As Gottshalk writes, 'prison guards' unions, state
departments of corrections, law enforcement groups, the private
corrections industry and the financial firms that devise bonds and other
mechanisms to fund the carceral state are all politically committed to
the prison's perpetuation (Gottshalk, 2015: 14). For example, the
largest and most powerful prison guard union, the California
Correctional Peace Officers Association, has 'repeatedly stymied
sensible proposals to modestly reduce California's prison population. It
also has aggressively challenged public officials and political
candidates who have sought to reduce the incarceration rate and to
prosecute guards who abuse prisoners' (Gottshalk, 2015: 160). Economic
interests in the perpetuation of the carceral state are not an
inconsiderable factor, given that today Correctional Services is the
third-largest employer in the US, outnumbered only by Manpower
Incorporated and Walmart, and ahead of General Motors (Wacquant, 2009:
157). Beyond this, Foucault (1977) argues that [taking an unruly
population of occasional lawbreakers and [turning them into]{.mark}
recidivist, [pathologized offenders]{.mark} has depoliticized
crime]{.underline}. [The rationale behind [prisons]{.mark} has [made
crime a psychiatric and sociological issue rather than a political issue
related to]{.mark} [poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Foucault,
[[the]{.mark} real [function]{.mark} of the prison [has]{.mark} thus
[been to]{.mark} [transform politicized offenders into psychiatrized and
stigmatized]{.mark} [delinquents]{.mark}, people viewed as social
problems]{.underline} or enemies of society. Importantly,
[depoliticizing crime]{.underline} in this way has [[driven a wedge
between the]{.mark} [poor and criminals]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus,
although criminals are still overwhelmingly poor people, [there
is]{.underline} often [hostility towards criminals on the part of the
poor]{.underline}. [The **[dissolution of solidarity]{.mark}** between
the poor and the criminalized [results]{.mark} [in **shame** and
**secrecy**]{.mark} [on the]{.mark} part of the [criminalized class and
prevents]{.mark}]{.underline} the kind of spontaneous political
[[uprisings]{.underline} [around]{.underline}]{.mark} issues of
[[penality and poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} that existed prior to
disciplinary transformations in punishment. Thus, a significant
consequence of the transformation of the lawbreaker into a delinquent is
that [[the poor]{.mark} have largely [ceased to]{.mark} identify and
[**empathize**]{.mark} with those subjected to the criminal punishment
system]{.underline}. [Crime is no longer understood as a normal response
to conditions of poverty, distress and oppression, but is perceived to
arise from [a pathologized identity from which all who can dissociate
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [shame]{.mark} [around
criminalization results in]{.mark} [silence]{.mark}]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} the part of [those who]{.underline} most directly
[experience the injustices of incarceration]{.underline}, who are
disproportionately people of colour. It is this consequence of [the
production of delinquency]{.underline} that has [allowed for the
astounding expansion of the prison]{.underline} across the Western world
in recent decades, which has unfolded [with little dissent and indeed
with widespread public]{.underline} [approval]{.underline}. For
Foucault, therefore, [the]{.underline} purpose and [function of the
prison]{.underline} [is]{.underline} not to rehabilitate offenders,
despite our continual rhetoric to this effect, but [to discipline
offenders into delinquents: manageable objects of knowledge cut off from
the rest of the population, or contained criminal cases rather than
political threats]{.underline}. In all these ways, although it does not
prevent crime, rehabilitate criminals or make the population safer, [the
prison is instrumental to the interests of the capitalist, biopolitical
and racist state]{.underline}. Foucault's influence on prison abolition

Foucault's influence on prison abolition scholarship and activism
Prisons are functioning exactly as they are supposed to Foucault's
argument about the political instrumentality of prisons has been central
to the critical prison studies scholarship and activism that has emerged
in the 50 years since Discipline and Punish was published, to the extent
that versions of this argument are frequently made both with and without
reference to Foucault. In particular, critical race and decolonial
scholars have adapted Foucault's argument to address the racist and
colonial functions of prisons in North American contexts. In Are Prisons
Obsolete?, Angela Davis (2003) situates prisons in the history of
anti-Black racism in the US. As she notes, [when slavery
was]{.underline} theoretically [abolished [after
the]{.mark}]{.underline} American [[Civil War]{.underline}]{.mark}, [it
was with one]{.underline} significant [exception]{.underline}:
[involuntary servitude]{.underline} was still permissible '[as a
punishment for crime]{.underline}, whereof the party shall have been
duly convicted' (cited in Davis, 2003: 28). Thus, [[slavery
was]{.mark}]{.underline} still **[perfectly]{.underline}**
[**[legal]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the form of the [hard
labour]{.mark}]{.underline} to which prisoners could be condemned as
part of their punishment. As Davis observes, [White people in the
American South]{.underline} were quick to [take advantage of this
**legal loophole** to begin mass incarcerating Black people]{.underline}
in order [to put]{.underline} [them back to work]{.underline} [at the
hard]{.underline} and unpaid [labour they had been obliged to do as
slaves]{.underline}. In this way, she argues, [the criminal punishment
system in the US 'recapitulated and further extended the regimes of
slavery']{.underline} (Davis, 2003: 33). In Punishing the Poor, Wacquant
(2009) argues that [[the]{.mark} racialized [ghetto emerged]{.mark} in
the US [as a means of containing]{.mark} [African Americans
following]{.mark} the elimination of [Jim Crow]{.mark}
Laws]{.underline}. [[When the]{.mark} urban [ghetto was]{.mark}
[rendered]{.mark} partially [obsolete by]{.mark} Black protests and
[race riots]{.mark}, [the prison]{.mark}, with its 'slaughterhouse
approach to justice']{.underline} (Wacquant, 2009: 23), [underwent a
'grotesque' [expansion]{.mark} in order to [function as a '**surrogate
ghetto'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wacquant, 2009: 196). In 'Life Behind
Bars: The Eugenic Structure of Mass Incarceration', Lisa Guenther (2016)
argues that [[prisons perpetuate **eugenics**]{.mark} in both the US and
Canadian contexts]{.underline}. As she demonstrates, not only do
[[nonconsensual]{.mark} eugenic [sterilizations]{.mark} continue to be
practised by prison doctors, but the [sexsegregated]{.mark} nature of
prisons, in which racialized, poor and disabled people are [separated
from their children]{.mark} and are frequently [detained]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} all or many of their [childbearing years]{.mark},
[prevents]{.mark} [both the biological and social reproduction
of]{.mark} biopolitically [devalued]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[populations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 'The colonialism of
incarceration', Robert Nichols (2014) [examines the
**[hyperincarceration]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of Indigenous
people]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Canadian context and the ways in
which the prison [[functions as a tool of]{.mark} ongoing [colonial
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Nichols argues, [the incarceration of
Indigenous people [substituted]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the use of
[residential schools]{.mark}]{.underline} when the latter were
eliminated, and Indigenous people are discriminated against at every
level of the criminal punishment system, from policing to trials to the
security level of the prisons in which they are placed. Still other
critical prison scholars have observed that [one of the most significant
functions of the [prison]{.mark} today is to [control
immigration]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} increasing numbers of both documented
and undocumented immigrants being held in [detention
centres]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gottshalk, 2015; Walia, 2013). Critical
disability studies and Mad studies scholars observe that [the prison has
taken over the role of psychiatric asylums and residential homes for the
intellectually disabled, with prison expansion occurring in the wake of
the deinstitutionalization of these populations]{.underline} (Ben-Moshe,
2014[). [In the wake of]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called
'[[de-institutionalization']{.mark}, [we have seen a]{.mark}
[criminalization of mental illness]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Michael
Rembis has argued, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} 'important
[[relationships]{.underline} [among]{.underline}]{.mark} the rise of
[[the prison industrial complex and]{.mark} [the]{.mark} increasing
[**psychiatrization** of]{.mark} both socially
"[deviant]{.mark}"]{.underline} [[behavior]{.mark} and incarcerated
populations]{.underline}, as well as the psychic trauma associated with
incarceration' (Rembis, 2014: 139). [Feminist and queer]{.underline}
critical prison [scholars]{.underline} have [demonstrated the
instrumentality of the prison in the biopolitical objectives of policing
gender]{.underline} (Mogul, Ritchie and Whitlock, 2012; Lydon, 2016).
[[Penitentiaries]{.underline} [were]{.underline}]{.mark} originally
[established]{.underline} in 18th-century England [[to house]{.mark}
'[penitent' sex workers]{.mark}, [punishing]{.mark} and reforming [their
aberrant gender]{.mark} [and sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mogul,
Ritchie and Whitlock, 2012: 94). '[Fallen women' were made to do
domestic work in penitentiaries in [training for the gendered
roles]{.mark} [of wives and domestic servants]{.mark} upon their
release]{.underline} (Davis, 2003). According to queer theorist Gayle
Rubin (2011), [there have]{.underline} also [been]{.underline} [ulterior
motives for the criminalization of aberrant sex acts]{.underline}, which
have had less to do with protecting women, children or society than with
[fortifying the patriarchal, heteronormative family and its
values]{.underline}. Mogul, Ritchie and Whitlock (2012) report the ways
in which [[gender nonconforming people incarcerated]{.mark} in women's
prisons [are]{.mark} taunted]{.underline} [and **[harassed]{.mark}** by
guards, referred to as 'little boys', and separated from the general
population to be housed in a 'butch wing', 'little boys' wing' or
'studs' wing']{.underline} (Mogul et al, 2012: 109).
[[Gay]{.underline}]{.mark} [and bisexual [prisoners]{.mark}]{.underline}
who can [[pass as straight]{.mark} often do so [to avoid
violence]{.mark}, administrative [segregation]{.mark} [and
ridiculing]{.mark} by homophobic guards]{.underline} (Kunzel, 2008: 2,
8--9). [[Trans prisoners are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[denied]{.mark}
the [gender-affirming]{.mark} medical [care]{.mark} that they need, as
well as gender-affirming clothing and cosmetics]{.underline}.
[Their]{.underline} [[gender]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[routinely [denied by]{.mark} placing them in [sex-segregated]{.mark}
[prisons]{.mark} based on the gender they were assigned at birth, where
they are at great risk of sexual violence]{.underline} (Spade, 2011;
Lydon, 2016). Needless to say, all of [these factors incentivize
normative gender]{.underline} [performance and normative sexuality with
life-and-death stakes]{.underline}. In his 2011 book Normal Life:
Administrative Violence, Critical Trans Politics, and the Limits of Law,
prison abolitionist and critical trans legal theorist Dean Spade takes
up Foucault's theories of power to argue that [the oppression of trans
people occurs largely at the level of administrative violence: everyday
administrative decisions that are products of social norms and curtail
the life chances of trans people]{.underline}. For these reasons, he
argues that [trans [oppression is not effectively addressed by
**legalistic** responses]{.mark} to discrimination and harm [that rely
on a racist, xenophobic, colonial, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and
ableist juridical-legal]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore, even if [the
prison]{.underline} fails to prevent crime or rehabilitate prisoners, it
is deeply embedded in the contemporary economy and [has proved
remarkably successful as a multi-purpose tool of capitalist, White
supremacist, xenophobic, ableist, saneist, gender normative and
heterosexist social control]{.underline}. Critical prison studies
scholars working in the Foucauldian tradition have persuasively argued
that this is what explains the prison's ongoing existence. Prison reform
extends the power of the prison

Because of their preexisting relationship with their child victims and
their grooming methods, perpetrators need not use force to accomplish
abuse or to guarantee silence. In most sexual abuse cases, the suspect
is familiar to the child, often a close relative (Goodman-Brown,
Edelstein, Goodman, Jones, & Gordon, 2003; Smith & Elstein, 1993). Such
a relationship gives the perpetrator access to the child and allows him
or her to capitalize on the child's trust. Research questioning
perpetrators about their modus operandi reveal how they actively develop
trust, compliance, and silence (Leclerc, Proulx, & Beauregard, 2009).
For example, Kaufman and colleagues (1998) interviewed 228 perpetrators
who reported that, over time, they would increasingly talk about sex,
encourage children to wear less clothing, and tell children that they
would "teach them something" before engaging in sexual acts. The
progressive nature of the abuse enabled perpetrators to assess the risk
of disclosure before the sexual behavior became overt, so that any
disclosures could be explained as innocent or misinterpreted (Lang &
Frenzel, 1988). Once overt sexual acts occurred, children would be
deterred from disclosing because the earlier acts made them feel as if
they had consented and led them to fear that they would be blamed for
failing to complain (Kaufman et al., 1998). [Perpetrators sometimes
**overtly** threaten children not to disclose the abuse.]{.underline}
[[In]{.mark} 27--**[33%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} criminal cases, [children
recall **overt threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gray, 1993; Smith &
Elstein, 1993; M ages 9 years old). According to Smith and Elstein
(1993), [[Warnings]{.mark} [ranged from]{.mark} pleas that the abuser
would get into trouble if the child told (or that [the abuser would be
sent]{.mark} [away]{.mark} and the child would never see them again---a
powerful message to a young child whose abuser is also a "beloved"
parent), to threats that the child would be **blamed** for the
abuse]{.underline} (especially troubling were [children who were told
that the defendant's intimate---[the]{.mark} child's
[mother]{.mark}---[would blame the child]{.mark} for "having sex" with
the defendant [and]{.mark} would thus [turn against]{.mark} him or
[her]{.mark}), [to]{.mark} ominous warnings that [the defendant would
**hurt** or **kill** the child]{.mark} (or someone he or she
loved]{.underline}) [[if they revealed the abuse]{.underline}]{.mark}
(p. 86). Perpetrators themselves have described how they discourage
children from disclosing (Elliott, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995; Smallbone &
Wortley, 2001). They emphasize the way in which disclosure will lead the
child to lose positive factors in his or her life, such as love,
affection, friendship, and family stability (Lang & Frenzel, 1988;
Smallbone & Wortley, 2001; Smith & Elstein, 1993). For example, in a
criminal sample of convicted offenders of child sexual abuse, [[**33%**
of offenders]{.mark} specifically [told their victims not to tell
and]{.mark} an additional **[20%]{.mark}** of offenders [reported having
**threatened** loss of love or said the child was to blame to]{.mark}
maintain abuse and [discourage disclosure]{.mark}]{.underline} (Elliott
et al., 1995). This was also reported by Conte, Wolfe, and Smith (1989),
who found that [[perpetrators encouraged silence by telling victims
their friends wouldn't like them anymore]{.mark}, their mom might be
mad, or just by generally advising children to be careful not to tell
anyone]{.underline}. The efficacy of perpetrators' methods is
demonstrated by delays in disclosure. The closeness of the relationship
between the perpetrator and the child increases the likelihood of
delayed disclo sure (Sas & Cunningham, 1995). Criminal samples reveal
that children typically delay disclosure until multiple instances of
abuse have occurred, with one third of children waiting at least a year
(Sas & Cunningham, 1995). In addition, children are capable of
describing their reasons for failing to disclose. Sas and Cunningham
(1995) interviewed 135 children (M age 10 years) after their case was
prosecuted and found that the most common [reasons for delaying
disclosure were]{.underline}: (a) [fear of harm to self or
others]{.underline}, (b) [fear of being rejected by a nonabusive
caregiver]{.underline}, (c) [concern for family and thinking that non-
or delaying disclosure might protect family]{.underline}, (d) [fear that
their disclosure would not be believed]{.underline}, (e) [concern that
bad consequences will harm the perpetrator]{.underline}, (f) [inability
to trust anyone to whom to disclose, and]{.underline} (g) [wanting to
protect other children, including siblings, from abuse]{.underline}.
These research findings suggest that, from the prosecutor's perspective,
much can be understood about the dynamics of abuse by inquiring into
what the suspect has said to the child, both to reveal grooming and to
uncover any admonishments against disclosure. Furthermore, it is likely
that the child will have delayed disclosing the abuse, and it is
worthwhile exploring the reasons for the delay so that the jury
understands. Indeed, prosecutors are advised to explore the dynamics of
abuse (Long et al., 2011), and the courts have been receptive to efforts
to educate juries about the reasons for children's delays and
inconsistencies (People v. Housley, 1992). The Defense Perspective

#### Plea deals are better for victims -- closure, certainty, no traumatic trials

As previously explained, some punishment for most defendants is better
than maximum punishment for a few defendants. This same principle holds
true for society as well. An analogy serves to illustrate.  Imagine a
prosecutor has thirty cases to prosecute. Each defendant is charged with
a crime that carries a twenty-year sentence and a 95% probability of
conviction. The complete trial process for each case---including
preparation---would be fifty hours while a plea hearing would take less
than one hour. Given the high probability of conviction at trial, it is
determined that a six-year plea offer would illicit a guilty plea from
the thirty defendants. Therefore, [in less than thirty hours this
prosecutor could sentence all thirty defendants to six years---assuming
they accepted the pleas.]{.underline} Compare this outcome to the
alternative where the prosecutor could invest fifty hours and probably
sentence one defendant to twenty years and drop the charges against the
other [Clearly, [more **net justice** is obtained through plea
bargaining]{.mark} even [though each defendant received]{.mark} far
[less than twenty years]{.mark}.]{.underline}4 Additional benefits to
society from plea bargaining are those received by the victims. [When
pleas are accepted, [victims receive **immediate closure**]{.mark}.
[They are spared the]{.mark} potentially [**traumatic** experience of
**reliving** their **victimization** at trial]{.mark}, [the possibility
of watching their victimizers go free, and the]{.mark} [**uncertainty**
of a potential successful appeal.]{.mark}]{.underline} Also, [with a
plea bargain]{.underline}, [[the victim's complaint is **vindicated** by
the admission of guilt]{.mark} by the defendant]{.underline}. [[At a
trial]{.mark}, however, the [defendant]{.mark} maintains his
innocence]{.underline};5 thus, effectively [[accusing the victim of
**lying**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Abolitionists sometimes attempt to
diminish the significant financial benefits of plea bargaining by
juxtaposing cost with justice, as if they are mutually exclusive. They
may point to quotes such as the following by Chief Justice Warren
Burger: "An affluent society ought not be miserly in support of justice,
for economy is not an objective of the system."6 But this view of
justice versus cost is a false dichotomy. Plea bargaining allows
prosecutors to not spend money where it would be wasteful and instead
spend it where it would promote the most justice---thus, enhancing both
monetary savings and justice when compared to the alternative of
abolishment.

### Contention 6: Jury Duty Bad

#### Mass lying for financial reasons prove jury duty is economic devastation for poor folk

**COSCA 23** \[Conference of State Court Administrators, 2023, "CITIZENS
ON CALL: Responding to the Needs of 21st Century Jurors," Conference of
State Court Administrators,
https://www.ncsc.org/sites/default/files/media/document/COSCA-Citizens-on-Call.pdf\]/Kankee

The cost of jury service Serving on a jury has long been understood as a
citizen's "civic duty;" an obligation born from our collective
commitment to a system of government that guarantees the right to a jury
of one's peers. When public trust in government was higher, serving on a
jury may have been an obligation willingly undertaken based on this
shared commitment. This may explain why juror pay has historically been
nominal -- because citizens were more willing to serve despite the
hardships that sometimes come along with jury service. Today we cannot
take that commitment for granted. A 2017 Pew Research Center study found
that young people and minorities are less likely to view jury duty as an
element of good citizenship.28 In addition to the public's decreasing
trust in public institutions, the burden of serving on a jury has only
increased. To address these issues, states need to be proactive in
removing the biggest barriers to juror service: financial hardship
compounded by extensive time commitments. [In a recent survey of 1,184
Americans, **9%** of respondents claimed to have lied to get out of jury
service]{.underline}. [[**Forty-eight** **percent** lied because of
financial concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[**Nineteen percent**]{.mark}
lied because they [feared consequences from their employer]{.mark} and
**[16%]{.mark}** lied [because of a **lack of
childcare**]{.mark}]{.underline}.29 While jurors may assert financial
hardship to be excused from jury duty, whether to grant the excusal is
judge dependent and may be rarely granted absent compelling
circumstances. [[Excusals]{.mark} for this reason [disproportionately
reduce]{.mark} the number of [low- income workers]{.mark} whose
experience]{.underline} and perspective [bring greater **diversity**
of]{.underline} thought to jury panels. Courts need to actively address
the financial hardship caused by jury service to improve participation
from citizens across the economic spectrum RECOMMENDATION: Courts should
advocate for adequate per diem pay and other cost mitigation measures.
For most states, it is the legislature that sets base per diem rates,
mileage or transportation reimbursement rates, and other lawful use of
funds to provide for jury service.30 It is naïve to expect that rates of
juror compensation will rise to a level of awareness that will put it at
the forefront of a legislative initiative unless a legislator has
recently been contacted by a constituent or actually served as a juror.
The judiciary is the only branch of government that has first-hand
knowledge of the effect of low juror compensation on response rates and
hardship excusals and the ability to regularly solicit input from
potential and actual jurors regarding juror compensation. As such,
courts have a duty to be a firm advocate for adequate juror
compensation. Most people who work hourly wage jobs are not paid if they
do not work, so spending any time away from work waiting to be selected
for a jury or actually serving on a jury means foregoing income. All
states have laws prohibiting employers from interfering with or
retaliating against an employee because of jury service, but [[most
states **do not**]{.mark} [require]{.mark} that employers provide
employees with [p]{.mark}aid [t]{.mark}ime [o]{.mark}ff to perform jury
service]{.underline}. Those [[jurisdictions]{.mark} that do require
employers to pay employees for jury service [limit]{.mark}]{.underline}
such [[obligation to larger]{.mark} [companies]{.mark} and limit the
benefit to full-time employees who work regular]{.underline}
[schedules]{.underline}.31 Consequently, [even in states with the most
generous juror compensation]{.underline}, those [individuals working for
a [small employer or]{.mark}]{.underline} working multiple [[part-time
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark} to make ends meet --- [the people]{.underline}
who are the [[least]{.mark} likely to be [able to]{.mark} afford to
[step]{.mark} [away]{.mark} from their sources of
employment]{.underline} --- [[have the **least protection**]{.mark}
from]{.underline} [financial hardship]{.underline}. Over the years,
[[juror pay has not kept pace with]{.mark} changes to the [minimum
wage]{.mark}, [**inflation** or **cost of
living**]{.mark}]{.underline}.32 Nationally, [**flat** per diem [rates
vary from **\$4 to \$50 per day**]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 States with
graduated rates for juror compensation attempt to reconcile extended
service and compensation rates, however, the high-end of these graduated
rates, notwithstanding Arizona's recent increase, is still low, topping
out at \$50 per day. New Mexico is the only state that has tied juror
pay to the prevailing minimum wage. That rate is currently \$12/hour,
and equates to \$96 for an 8-hour day. Arizona is the first state to pay
per diem rates tied to the actual wages of jurors. Under this model,
jurors can claim up to \$300 per day for wage replacement. Effective
strategies for raising juror pay have included an emphasis on the number
of years and the changing cost of living since the last time juror pay
was increased and a repudiation of using other low-paying jurisdictions
as a reason to continue to keep per diem rates low. As noted by Arizona
State Court Administrator Dave Byers, courts should not be content to
argue for incremental adjustments to juror pay. Instead, they should
make a robust argument for a rate of pay that is fair to jurors and will
make an actual difference in response rates. STRATEGY: Lengthy Trial

#### Jury duty is regressive, obliterating poor folks' income by missing work

**Pattison-Gordon 25** \[Jule Pattison-Gordon, senior staff writer for
Governing with a B.A. from Carnegie Mellon, 3-25-2025, \"How Courts Are
Trying to Make Jury Duty More Appealing\", Governing,
https://www.governing.com/policy/how-courts-are-trying-to-make-jury-duty-more-appealing\]/Kankee

In Brief: A 2023 report found [some [courts compensate jurors]{.mark} as
little as [**\$4 a day** for missing work]{.mark}]{.underline} to serve,
and [[some]{.mark} only [pay]{.mark} starting [on the second day]{.mark}
of service]{.underline}. [When [compensation]{.mark} is low, jury duty
can result in **painful lost income** and [prompt]{.mark} more
[low-income people to]{.mark} [seek exemption from serving]{.mark},
[making juries less]{.mark}]{.underline} [[diverse]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Some states are rethinking how much they reimburse jurors. Courts also
work to fine-tune exactly how many jurors they call in, using algorithms
to calculate the likelihood that enough jurors will show, and adopting
new processes to reduce time spent waiting in the courtroom. Trial by
jury is meant to be an important safeguard in ensuring justice and
keeping courts responsive to the people they serve. But today, [[jury
duty is]{.mark} often seen as [a **pain**]{.mark} --- whether an
annoying inconvenience or [genuine **hardship**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[One major challenge is that [jurors are]{.mark} often [forced to miss
work]{.mark}. Their [employers might not compensate]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}, and most courts pay only **[nominal fees]{.mark}** that
[do not go far toward replacing lost wages]{.mark}]{.underline}. Jurors
also report frustration about waiting around for hours at a courthouse
only to be told to go back home. As courts continue looking for ways to
improve the juror experience, some have been working to improve
compensation and minimize the time jurors spend waiting, in the hopes of
making it easier to serve, thereby improving the diversity of juries and
changing public attitudes about jury service. Many people are wary of
jury duty, says Pamela Wood, jury commissioner of the Massachusetts
Court System. "People think, 'Oh, I\'m going to be sequestered and on a
three-month racketeering and gang trial, and it's going to be awful,'"
Wood says. Her office's public outreach program tries to dispel that
view and educate people about what the experience is more likely going
to entail: "You're going to go to a nice little suburban courthouse, and
you're going to sit on a three-hour OUI \[operating under the
influence\] case and you\'re going to deliberate for an hour or two and
return a verdict and be home in time for dinner. And then you will have
done your civic duty and \... you\'re probably going to find it to be
one of the most interesting and inspirational experiences of your life
to actually see the process in action." Deciding How Many to Call When
courts can better determine how many jurors they'll need --- and avoid
calling too many --- it's a win for everyone. It spares residents from
taking time away from their lives to come in. It also helps the courts
avoid burning through their list of potential jurors unnecessarily.
That's because in some systems, people who turn up for their jury duty
dates are exempted from serving again within a certain time period,
regardless of whether they wound up impaneled. Getting the number right
can be tricky, however. Courts need to call in a few more jurors than
they expect to actually use, in case something unexpected happens. But
if they overdo it, many prospective jurors will be left waiting around.
To see how well they're doing, courts can look to their "juror
utilization rate," which is the percentage of the total pool of
"qualified and available jurors" who are used at least once in a trial
or who are questioned by attorneys and the judge for their suitability
to serve in a trial (a process known as \"voir dire\"). A juror might go
unused if the judges and attorneys have already impaneled all the jurors
they need for the day's trials, if the trial gets canceled or postponed,
or if case participants decide to do a plea deal or settlement instead
of going to trial. The National Center for State Courts recommends in a
2023 report that courts aim to have a 72 percent juror utilization rate.
At that time, however, state courts were falling "woefully short," and
averaging just a 25 percent juror utilization rate. The situation was
especially bad in larger jurisdictions, with courts that serve 500,000
or more people averaging only a 16 percent juror utilization rate, while
courts serving fewer than 25,000 people averaged a 31 percent rate. Some
courts look to historic data to help them estimate how many jurors to
summon. The Massachusetts Court System, for one, uses algorithms to
assess how many jurors to call in and how many of the people who said
"yes" to the summons are actually likely to show up (as well as how many
of the people who deferred or didn't reply might show up too). That then
lets the court system see if there are any superfluous jurors who can
have their service canceled. "Each of our 65 courts we analyze
separately using computer algorithms," explains Wood. The algorithms
consider how each courthouse's unique characteristics might influence
jurors' likelihood of appearing. That means considering the availability
of parking or public transportation and the reputation of the
surrounding neighborhood. But the court is still working to get a handle
on the ways that COVID-19 changed things, and introduced new factors
that can influence who shows up. For example, people who are
immunocompromised may be more wary of coming into a courthouse to serve,
while people who think pandemic concerns were overblown may try harder
to show up, to make a point about unnecessary caution. "Everything we do
in terms of figuring out how many summonses to send out --- and how to
hit the target and not bring in too many, but be sure to supply enough,
etc., etc., --- is based on historical data of how certain types of
people behave in certain courts, and there is no historical data on how
people behave during and after a pandemic." Wood says. Minimizing Time
in Court The Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County has also been
fine-tuning its approach to jury management, to reduce the time jurors
spend waiting at the courthouse. That can make jury service a far less
burdensome experience. Last year, the court began piloting "remote
case-specific questionnaires," explains Deputy Jury Commissioner Tiana
Burdick. The court emails or texts jurors a digital questionnaire they
can answer at home. Afterward, judges and attorneys review the responses
to determine who to strike. This lets the court alert struck jurors that
they won't be needed before they even leave their homes --- while the
jurors who aren't struck only have to show up when they're needed for a
particular case. That might mean coming in at 10:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m.,
rather than the usual 7:45 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. When remote questionnaires
aren't used, jurors need to show up early to complete an on-site
questionnaire, then wait as judges and attorneys decide which jurors to
strike and which to keep for afternoon trials. That could mean jurors
waiting around until noon to find out if they'll serve. "In calendar
year 2024, over 3,000 jurors never had to even come downtown. They were
struck in advance, but yet they still got to participate," Burdick says.
"They never had to take a day off of work; they never had to make the
drive downtown, but yet still participated." The Conference of State
Court Administrators has endorsed such practices, recommending in a 2023
report that courts let jurors complete online questionnaires in advance,
to allow for disqualifying or excusing jurors without first requiring
them to come in to the courthouse. Raising the Pay Poor compensation for
jury service is a financial hardship for people with low income or whose
employers don't pay them for days they attend jury duty. [Not all states
require employers to provide paid time off for jury service, and in
those that do, the obligation is typically reserved for full-time
employees at large companies]{.underline}, per the Conference of State
Court Administrators. [[People paid hourly]{.mark} [wages]{.mark},
working for a small company, self-employed or working part time at one
or more jobs may [suffer lost income]{.mark}]{.underline} from serving
on a jury. [Court-provided compensation for jury duty often doesn't keep
up with minimum wage]{.underline}. A 2023 report found some courts
paying as little as \$4 per day for each day of service. Some courts,
like [the Alaska court system, **paid nothing** for]{.underline} [the
first day of jury service, only providing compensation starting on the
second]{.underline} day. Lost income can be significant; [[in
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} state at the time, [[there was a **\$237
gap** between]{.mark} [the daily per capita income in the state
and]{.mark} the maximum daily [juror compensation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Some courts excuse people for whom serving is a financial hardship, but
this can mean cases are stuck with juries that have less diversity of
life experiences. San Francisco is one jurisdiction that increased pay
for jurors with low or moderate incomes. "Higher jury pay does, in fact,
diversify juries. When juries are more reflective of the communities
they serve, they spend more time in deliberations and are less likely to
presume guilt," said Assemblymember Phil Ting in a press release
statement announcing continuation of the compensation program. In the
past several years jurisdictions across the country have been upping
compensation, realizing that low pay "is a barrier to diversity and
representativeness," says Wood. A current bill [in
Massachusetts]{.underline} could help, by raising the rate of jurors
compensation to \$100 per day, up from \$[50/day]{.underline} --- a rate
that was a "princely sum" back when it was [set in 1979]{.underline} but
[which doesn't keep up today]{.underline}, Wood says. New Mexico takes
the unusual approach of tying juror compensation to the minimum wage and
paying by the hour, at \$12/hour. In September 2022, Arizona became the
first state to link the level of per diem compensation to the actual
amount of income jurors lost by serving. Jurors impaneled on superior
court cases now can apply online for reimbursement of up to \$300 per
day of lost income. And Burdick's court in Maricopa County also now
offers bus passes so people who cannot or do not drive can get to the
courthouse. Who's on the Jury Lists? Along with increasing compensation,
getting a representative list of potential jurors can improve diversity.
Court systems randomly select names from this list to determine who to
send out summons letters to. Many courts create their list of names from
records like voter registration and drivers\' licenses lists. But
relying on records related to optional activities can limit what slice
of the population juries are drawn from --- for example, only those
who've chosen to vote or who have the money and need to acquire a car.
Massachusetts courts have the good fortune of a more expansive list,
Wood says. Cities and towns throughout the state must conduct censuses
every year, with the information used by many different government
agencies, including the courts.

#### Jury duty is a net negative financially due to expenses, harming low-income folk

**Amos 25** \[Denise Amos, California Voices Deputy Editor and graduate

hard to get one\", CalMatters,

Picking a jury when there's 'undue hardship' For the San Diego murder
trial, the judge called in a jury pool of nearly 110 people. He
explained that it takes that many people and two full days to eventually
select 12 jurors and four alternates for a criminal case expected to
last several weeks. [Some prospective jurors won't serve because of
"**undue hardship**]{.underline}," he said. [Too many employers are
refusing to pay workers on jury duty]{.underline}. [California
law]{.underline} says employers can't fire workers serving on juries,
but it [doesn't make employers pay them]{.underline}. That's why
[California consistently fills juries with retirees or people who work
in white-collar jobs or who have the money to go without pay. Equal
justice is just an **empty promise** if [a minimum wage worker earns
**eight times** more than jurors]{.mark}]{.underline} [[make in a
day]{.underline}]{.mark}. Add to that, [[a juror's expenses can
easily]{.mark} **[outstrip]{.mark}** [the daily
pay]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In San Diego, [jurors]{.mark} who drove ha[d
to pay to park]{.mark} ---- [that's]{.mark} \$25 to \$**[40 a
day]{.mark}** --- [and pay for lunch]{.mark}, [which ran about]{.mark}
**[\$20]{.mark}** at nearby restaurants]{.underline}. I rode the trolley
and packed lunch to save money. During my first two days of jury duty,
people described their financial hardship. [One]{.underline} young
[man]{.underline} told the judge --- in front of everyone --- that he
[had been **unemployed for months** and was still looking for work. [A
woman]{.mark} complained she [couldn't afford **several weeks** of child
care]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[A]{.mark}nother [man was unsure
he'd keep his job beyond two weeks on jury duty]{.mark}]{.underline}.
None of them were picked for the jury. Besides finances, certain life
experiences can be factors in shaping a jury. In this trial, the
108-member jury pool was given a 75-question survey designed to identify
bias. Some questions made me suspect I might be disqualified, like the
question about whether I or a family member had been a victim of a
crime. Yes, my mother was violently mugged years ago, I wrote, and the
police didn't arrest anyone. I answered 'yes' to a question about
whether anyone in my family had been arrested. When my brother was a
preteen, he got caught entering an abandoned factory with friends. He
took a plea deal and stayed out of jail, but knowing how few Black boys
got breaks, I was terrified for him, I wrote. While scribbling my
answers I wondered how many other juror candidates had similar
responses? Would negative experiences with police make us unsuitable?
There were other, more obvious potential disqualifiers: I'm a Black
woman, so a lawyer might assume I don't trust police or the courts. And
I'm a journalist, a profession often excluded from juries for various
reasons. After reading the questionnaires, the judge interrogated us. By
the time he got to me, about a dozen people --- including several white
people --- told the judge that they were not confident a person of color
could get a fair shake in the legal system. I was surprised at how many
held that view. But a woman next to me whispered that they weren't all
taking principled stands; some just thought it might get them out of
jury duty. The judge grilled me about my family's encounters with
police. He asked point-blank if I thought my brother was treated fairly
by the court. I told him that since my brother didn't have to serve jail
time, maybe he was. I guess my answer was acceptable. When the judge
empaneled the jurors and sent the rest home, I was the last juror
selected. The right to a jury trial is so vital that it's spelled out in
the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. But seeking a jury of peers
does not mean that male defendants will only be tried by men, or Asians
by Asians, or African Americans by African Americans. It does mean a
court cannot intentionally exclude someone because of race or gender. To
me that doesn't go far enough. California should make it easier for
jurors to serve, especially those who come from the world the defendant
lives in. If it costs California \$27 million to try to reach that
standard in seven counties, it's worth it.

#### Low pay is "institutional exclusion" for black and poor folk 

**Williams 25** \[June Williams, reporter on judicial issues, 2016,
\"Low Jury Pay Excludes Minorities & Poor, Class Says in Washington\",

https://www.courthousenews.com/low-jury-pay-excludes-minorities-poor-class-says-in-washington/\]/Kankee

Low pay for jury service has caused grumbling for decades. Now
[Washington]{.underline} residents have filed a class action claiming
the [\$10 a day stipend violates minimum wage laws and prevents
low-income minorities from serving]{.underline}, [with a \"pernicious
effect on the judicial system]{.underline}.\" King County\'s
\$10-per-day [reimbursement]{.underline} for mileage or travel
[**hasn\'t changed** since]{.underline} **[1959]{.underline}**, lead
plaintiff Ryan Rocha says in the complaint in Pierce County Court. He
says [the low pay effectively **prevents** minorities and poor people
from participating in jury service]{.underline}. A Seattle worker
earning minimum wage would make \$104 for an eight-hour day, and all
minimum-wage workers in Washington earn at least \$75 for eight hours.
Rocha et al. sued in Pierce County Superior Court to avoid a conflict of
interest in King County, whose seat is Seattle. King County, pop. 2
million, is the largest county in Washington by population and the 13th
most populous county in the United States. Pierce County, whose seat is
Tacoma, just south of Seattle, is the state\'s second most populous
county, with 800,000 residents. Rocha and co-plaintiff Nicole Bednarczyk
say they want to serve as jurors but their employers don\'t pay for jury
duty so it would be too much of a financial hardship. \"Plaintiffs Ryan
Rocha and Nicole Bednarczyk are individuals of low economic status who
work for employers that do not compensate employees for jury service.
Plaintiff Rocha is also black, and [issues of [income inequality and
financial]{.mark} **[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[disproportionately affect]{.underline}]{.mark} King County\'s
[[communities of color]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Plaintiffs]{.underline}]{.mark} Rocha and Bednarczyk [are eligible and
eager to serve]{.underline} as jurors in the courts of King County [but
[cannot]{.mark} [afford to forgo the income they would lose]{.mark}
while doing so]{.underline},\" the complaint states. \"[If King County
summoned them to perform jury service today]{.underline},
[[plaintiffs]{.underline}]{.mark} Rocha and Bednarczyk [[would be forced
to request]{.mark} [financial hardship exemptions]{.mark} [despite their
desire to participate]{.mark} in the judicial process]{.underline}.
Indeed, King County has previously excused plaintiff Bednarczyk from
serving as a juror on the basis of financial hardship. [Because King
County refuses to pay]{.underline} individuals [for]{.underline} time
spent performing [jury]{.underline} [service]{.underline}, plaintiff
Rocha, plaintiff Bednarczyk, and [[others are being]{.mark}
[**excluded** on the basis of economic status, race, and
color]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" The other named plaintiff, Catherine
Selin, served on a jury for 11 days last year, and also worked for an
employer that did not compensate her. She says King County violated the
state\'s minimum wage act by not paying her. \"King County is violating
Washington law in the operation of its jury system. Specifically, [King
County\'s failure to pay individuals for time spent performing jury
service has a disparate impact on low-income people and people of color,
preventing them from jury participation]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark}
form of [**institutional exclusion** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[discrimination]{.underline}**]{.mark} [violates state law and [has a
pernicious effect on]{.mark} the judicial system and American

CHALLENGE 4: **[Post-trial anxiety]{.underline}**,
**[guilt]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[vicarious
trauma]{.underline}** In addition to security and privacy concerns, [the
impact of jury service on juror mental health is a
**serious**]{.underline} [consideration]{.underline} that warrants the
attention of the courts. In a recent survey,
**[[26%]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of jurors [admitted to]{.mark}
struggling with [**persistent** negative emotions]{.mark} after
completing jury]{.underline} [duty, with nearly [**50%**
report]{.mark}ing [**high levels** of anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Other [symptoms included guilt, shame, anger and
fear]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [survey]{.underline} [found]{.underline}
that [[negative emotions persisted for]{.underline}]{.mark} an average
of **[[two years]{.underline}]{.mark}** following service.65
**[[Vicarious trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has been defined as, "the
emotional residue of exposure to traumatic stories]{.underline} and
experiences of others through work; witnessing fear, pain, and terror
that others have experienced; a pre-occupation with horrific stories
told to the professional."66 The term is sometimes used interchangeably
with terms such as compassion fatigue, secondary trauma, or insidious
trauma. [This phenomenon is most often related to the experience of
being exposed to stories of cruel and inhumane acts perpetrated by and
toward people in our society]{.underline}.67 By virtue of their
responsibilities, judges and court staff are susceptible to vicarious
trauma "due to the combination of working in a busy court, hearing
repeated accounts of harrowing or traumatic events, and worrying about
safety issues that may arise around volatile or emotionally charged
cases."68 Likewise, [[jurors]{.underline}]{.mark} who are exposed to
these same cases and stories, and whose function it is to evaluate and
analyze gruesome evidence and facts, [[are at risk]{.mark} for the same
kind of trauma]{.underline}. A 2002 study conducted by Sonia Chopra at
Simon Fraser University describes how taxing it can be to serve on a
jury. **[[Two-thirds]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of former
jurors]{.underline} interviewed for Chopra's study [[reported]{.mark}
experiencing [stress]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of their jury
experience, and [nearly **half** of them said they believed that stress
affected the decisions made by their fellow jurors]{.underline}. [A
**third**]{.underline} [said they had difficulty sleeping as a
result]{.underline} [of their trial memories]{.underline}, while almost
**[[20%]{.underline}]{.mark}** [said the experience left them
[feel]{.mark}ing "**[more fearful]{.mark}**" than before]{.underline}.69
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Crime Victims,
some of the [[negative effects]{.underline}]{.mark} [of vicarious
trauma]{.underline} may [[include]{.underline}]{.mark}: • [Difficulty
managing emotions; • Feeling emotionally numb or shut down; • Fatigue,
sleepiness, or difficulty falling asleep; • Physical problems or
complaints, such as aches, pains and decreased resistance to illness; •
Being easily distracted, which can increase one's risk of accidents; •
[Loss of a sense of meaning in life]{.mark} and/or **[feeling
hopeless]{.mark}** about the future; • [Relationship problems]{.mark}
(e.g. withdrawing from friends and family, increased interpersonal
conflict, avoiding intimacy); • Feeling vulnerable or **[worrying
excessively]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} potential [dangers]{.mark} in the
world [and loved ones']{.mark} [safety]{.mark}; • [Increased]{.mark}
irritability, **aggressive**, **explosive**, or **violent outbursts**
and behavior; • [**Destructing coping** or **addictive**
behaviors]{.mark} (e.g. [over]{.mark}/under [eating]{.mark}, [substance
abuse, gambling]{.mark}, taking [undue risks]{.mark} in sports or
driving): • Lack of or decreased participation in activities that used
to be enjoyable; • Avoiding work and interactions with clients or
constituents; [and]{.mark}]{.underline} • A combination of symptoms that
comprise a diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
(**[[PTSD]{.underline}]{.mark}**). In 1998 the National Center for State
Courts released "Through the Eyes of the Juror." 70 This manual
identifies causes of juror stress at all stages of jury service and
includes extensive recommendations on mitigating the impact of those
stressors. Twenty-five years after this manual was published[, only a
handful of courts have implemented strategies to actively support jurors
following their service]{.underline}, though that trend may be starting
to change in light of society's increased acknowledgement of vicarious
trauma and heightened awareness of the importance of mental health. 29

CHALLENGE 3: Privacy concerns and fears about personal and family safety
Juror Privacy In recent years, more attention has been given to juror
privacy and the consequences of publicly releasing personal
information.38 The debate over these issues has led to discussions about
a defendant's right to a fair trial and the need to ensure juror
impartiality. The Sixth Amendment requires that a criminal defendant be
tried publicly. The media and public have rights under the First and
Fourteenth Amendment to observe many criminal proceedings including
trials and often the process to evaluate jurors for partiality.39 Courts
in both civil and criminal matters frequently find it necessary to
inquire about personal matters during questioning.40 Juror names and
addresses are often revealed during the trial's voir dire phase.
Transcripts from preliminary hearings concerning jurors are often
available to the public. Moreover, [juror information is generally made
available after a verdict]{.underline}. This helps ensure that the
proceedings are conducted fairly. But [this threat to juror privacy may
impact a willingness to serve]{.underline}. "\[[J\]urors do not
deliberately seek out this particular form of public service and do
not]{.underline}, therefore, [automatically **surrender** all
expectations of privacy]{.underline}."41 [With the advent of social
media and the availability of information on the internet, the debate
over whether the public's right to monitor the trial outweighs the
jurors' right to privacy continues to intensify]{.underline}. Throughout
the voir dire process, [[jurors]{.mark} are]{.underline} often [asked
questions about their relationships, family, and friends]{.underline}.
[Jurors]{.underline} have [expressed [**worry** over the release
of]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation about their residence, occupation, and
educational background]{.underline}.42 They fear that the release of
[private information]{.underline} in their completed questionnaires
[[may cause]{.underline}]{.mark} personal
**[[embarrassment]{.underline}]{.mark}**.43 [[Questions about]{.mark}
[personal health]{.mark} issues, [use of]{.mark} legal and [illegal
medications]{.mark}, [or experience as crime victims]{.mark} [are
**common**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 44 [[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} have
expressed overall [[**worry** about]{.underline}]{.mark} the extent of
[[media coverage]{.underline}]{.mark} of the trial [[and the
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} of that coverage [for their
exposure]{.underline} during and [[after the trial]{.mark}, including
[to]{.mark} their [**employment** or]{.mark}
**[reputation]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the community.45,46 Privacy
concerns beyond voir dire Juror privacy also remains at risk outside the
voir dire process. [Investigation of]{.underline} both potential and
seated [jurors]{.underline} [has become a regular occurrence
in]{.underline} jurisdictions that provide access to juror contact
information. [Private [attorneys]{.mark}]{.underline} may
[[hire]{.underline}]{.mark} jury consultants or [[private
investigators]{.mark} to search juror backgrounds and scour social media
accounts]{.underline}, while government lawyers may use existing
government resources to do the same.47 In a 2021study of jurors and new
media, [[**40%** of]{.mark} judges and [lawyers]{.mark} reported that
attorneys **[frequently]{.mark}** [use the internet to]{.mark} conduct
re[search]{.mark} on prospective jurors]{.underline} and another 30%
reported that they sometimes do.48 Privacy issues have only been
exacerbated with increased use of social media platforms. With sites
like Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, lawyers and litigants
now have a treasure trove of information at their fingertips. There is
no recognized right to monitor a juror's use of social media. However,
it has become standard practice for counsel and jury consultants to do
so. A 2019 article in a publication of the American Bar Association
titled Voir Dire Becomes Voir Google: Ethical Concerns of 21st Century
Jury Selection,49 devotes one paragraph to concerns about invading juror
privacy and several pages to the dangers of forgoing such a search. A
lawyer risks alienating a juror by violating privacy. But there are
risks of not conducting online research. Jurors may engage in online
misconduct risking a mistrial. There are many instances in which a case
has been undone by the actions of a single juror who has taken it upon
his or her self to research the issues, parties, and even evidence in a
case, or to communicate with third parties about the case. Jurors have
posted on Facebook about their deliberations or sent "friend" requests
to parties Big Data The emergence of "[[big data]{.mark}"
[**threatens**]{.mark} to further complicate the landscape. Commercial
providers possess, and many government databases contain, better, more
targeted, but **very personal** data in easily accessible
formats]{.underline}. Courts could use this data to select a larger jury
venire, and litigants could use this data to select the particular jury
panel. For court administrators, the availability of additional
information provides the potential for increased jury diversity, beyond
the categories of race, gender, and geography. For litigants, the
available information could provide a wealth of insights once only
available from expensive jury consultants. "Big data could democratize
access to information about jurors, leading to more diverse juries and
jury venires, and potentially less discriminatory jury selection
practices."50 At the same time, court use of [big data technology
carries real risks. Increased collection of personal information
involves [an]{.mark} **[invasion of privacy]{.mark}** that could result
in **significant backlash** against jury service]{.underline}. "[Jurors
summoned to serve in the venire or questioned for the jury panel do not
expect that jury selection will involve use of the full range of
available consumer data. Jurors]{.underline} generally [expect to be
anonymous]{.underline}, more a juror number than a name. [Jurors expect
to]{.underline} arrive as citizens, do their job, and then [disappear
back into society as faceless, nameless members of a jury]{.underline}.
Equalizing the availability of big data information about jurors and
making it a part of the jury selection system, raises practical,
theoretical, and constitutional dilemmas which must be addressed."51 If
courts are going to venture into the use of big data, they must inform
potential jurors about the use of the data collected by the court and,
to the extent possible, take steps to prevent commercialization of the
data by third parties. Protection for jurors Recently more attention has
been paid to protecting both jurors and the accused without undercutting
First Amendment rights to observe criminal trials. In response, courts
have recognized some limited privacy rights for jurors. The Supreme
Court has called juror privacy a "compelling interest" when balancing
privacy rights with the First Amendment right of the press to know about
public jury trials.52 Many trial judges and court staff are becoming
more sensitive and sympathetic to the privacy concerns of jurors and are
modifying their jury procedures.53 54 "The result is a national
hodge-podge of court procedures concerning litigant and public access to
juror information--- few of which adequately address all facets of juror
privacy and many of which are of questionable legality given the strong
statutory and constitutional policies in favor of open court proceedings
and records."55 Jurors are not volunteers. They come to court under
summons and answer questionnaires under court order. The sharing of
private information is compelled under threat of contempt of court.56 In
her article, Hannaford speaks to a number of tactics employed by courts
to protect juror privacy but notes that they are often limited and
inadequate in many cases. "Most citizens understand the importance of
revealing personal information in the context of a specific trial, but
are less convinced that the court should permit unrestricted public
access to that information in the context of a specific trial,
...\[and\] are less convinced that the court should permit unrestricted
public access to that information forever."57 Recognizing the growing
concerns about juror privacy and safety, Oregon adopted a statutory
provision in 2021 which prohibits identification of a juror by name in
any court proceeding that is open to the public. The statute protects
the parties right to the names of the jurors, unless the court
determines there is good cause to order otherwise.58 With the recent
explosion of information readily available to litigants, the tension
between juror privacy and the need to ensure juror impartiality can be
expected to intensify. RECOMMENDATION: Courts should establish an
expectation that parties conduct pre-service background checks only as
authorized by court order or through supplemental questionnaires that
have been approved by the court.

### Contention 7: Jim Crow Juries Bad

#### Juries are majority white - peremptory strikes, summons lists, financial hardship, past criminal records

**O\'Brien and Grosso 25** \[Barbara O\'Brien, Professor of Law at the
MSU College of Law, and Catherine M. Grosso, Professor of Law at the MSU
College of Law, 2025, "The Costs to Democracy of a Hegemonic Ideology of
Jury Selection, Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law,
https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/osjcl22&i=66\]/Kankee

The high burden to win even these narrow claims undermines a true
commitment to juries that are actually racially diverse and
representative. Moreover, prevailing on either a fair cross-section or a
Batson claim is extraordinarily difficult because even substantial
evidence of racial disparities yields to the state and litigants\'
theories about what constitutes a reasonable effort to summon a fair
cross section of jurors and who makes a good juror, however unsupported
those theories may be. Put simply, aspirations about broad democratic
participation in juries always seem to take a back seat to the desire to
exercise firm control over the selection of a jury. Indeed, the
dominance of the Ideology of Jury Selection is evidenced by courts\' and
[[lawyers\']{.underline}]{.mark} ability to
[[exercise]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [**[complete]{.underline}**
[control over]{.underline}]{.mark} [[who may]{.mark} and may not
[serve]{.mark} as jurors]{.underline}. [The **unquestioning adherence**
to]{.underline} current capital [jury selection procedures]{.underline},
including Witherspoon exclusions,\'o2 [and]{.underline} the availability
of [expansive [peremptory strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}, [despite their
well-documented and well-articulated [costs]{.mark} to jury
participation by [people of color]{.mark}, reflect a hegemonic
ideology]{.underline} that runs up [against values arising
from]{.underline} the role of [juries]{.underline} in the U.S.
democratic system. The following section takes stock of these costs.
III. JURY SELECTION UNFAILINGLY RELEGATES FULL DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION
[Race has long been used]{.underline}-explicitly and [implicitly-to
exclude citizens from jury participation]{.underline}.1 03 Early state
laws strictly limited jury participation to white male property owners.1
04 The exclusion of Black citizens from juries through the middle of the
last century was \"near absolute.\" 105 Decades later, [racism-explicit,
implicit, and structural-continues to produce disparities in how
jurisdictions summon potential jurors, whom the court excuses for cause
or hardship, and how lawyers exercise their peremptory
strikes]{.underline}.1 06 In many places, [[juries remain
**predominantly white**]{.underline}]{.mark} [even though the
communities in which they sit are not]{.underline}.1 0 7 These
[disparities persist]{.underline} even [though the law no longer
tolerates explicit discrimination]{.underline} because efforts to
rectify them conflict with much of the hegemonic ideology that dominates
the law of jury selection. Each step in the process reflects choices and
tradeoffs that ultimately undermine the goal of broad citizen
participation and the seating of diverse juries. To begin the process of
jury selection, each jurisdiction creates a jury summons list to call
potential jurors to the courthouse. As noted above, the Sixth Amendment
fair cross-section right requires that jury summons practices include
groups in the community and provide them fair and reasonable
representation on venires. 10 8 Historically, exclusion has been the
norm. As noted, juries originally included only white men with property.
Over time a fair cross section of the community came to include women
and people of color, at least in the abstract. The way a jurisdiction
compiles its [[summons list]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, often
[causes]{.underline} it to **[[underrepresent]{.underline}]{.mark}**
some [segments of the population. [Voter registration]{.mark} lists
underrepresent people of color]{.underline}, yet voter registration
records alone [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} in combination with other
databases remain predominant in jury selection across the country,
followed only by [[driver\'s license lists]{.underline}]{.mark}, a list
also likely to **[exclude]{.underline}** [people of color
disproportionately]{.underline}.1 09 At the end of the day, \"[this
country\'s history]{.underline} with respect to \[\] Tocqueville\'s free
school [is not one of wide availability-especially for racial and
language minorities]{.underline}.\"\" 0 [Limits on juror]{.underline}
[qualifications]{.underline} may also [contribute to the exclusion of
people of color from juries]{.underline}. For example, many
[[jurisdictions]{.underline}]{.mark} **[systematically]{.underline}**
[**[disqualify]{.underline}** [people with]{.underline}
]{.mark}[previous]{.underline} [[misdemeanors or felonies]{.mark}; given
the over-policing of people of color and their overrepresentation in
criminal courts, this disqualification disproportionally limits
participation by people of color]{.underline}.\"1 Excusing potential
jurors for cause also undermines diversity. Thomas Frampton analyzed
decision making in challenges for cause in 400 criminal jury trials in
Louisiana and Mississippi, documenting that \"[black jurors\'
\'qualifications\' for jury service]{.underline}, or lack thereof,
[operate as an important instrument of racial exclusion]{.underline}.\"
2 He found that Louisiana [[prosecutors]{.mark} moved to [exclude
Black]{.mark} prospective [jurors]{.mark} for cause [at **3.24 times**
the rate of white]{.mark} prospective [jurors]{.mark}]{.underline},\" 3
and Mississippi [[prosecutors]{.mark} in the study [were **6.8
times**]{.mark} more likely [to]{.mark} seek a cause [challenge]{.mark}
against [a]{.mark} [Black]{.mark} prospective [juror]{.mark} than a
white prospective juror]{.underline}.\" 4 Anna Offit documented ways
that cause [dismissals for [financial hardship]{.mark} disparately
[exclude]{.mark} jurors of color]{.underline}.\'1 5 She noted that the
concerns about the [[racialized]{.underline}]{.mark} experience of
[[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} [featured]{.underline} [prominently
in]{.underline} federal hearings on [jury selection]{.underline} in the
late 1960s, and that 2019 [poverty rates continued to reflect
significant racial disparities]{.underline}.1 16 Offit observed that
\"[even in the absence of explicit racial animus or bias, financial
hardship stands as a **persistent obstacle** to representative jury
participation]{.underline},\"\" 7 noting previous research showing that
[jurors were \"**most likely** to face dismissal during voir dire as a
result of economic hardship, including the risk of lost income, and the
need to care for a child or another dependent]{.underline}.\"\'1 8 Offit
analyzed 120 semi-structured interviews with state and federal
prosecutors and public defenders across 30 civil and criminal
proceedings 119 to show how judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys
worked collaboratively to document and justify these dismissals, often
concluding that dismissals \"were best serving everyone\'s
interests.\"\'20 They did so without regard to how the dismissals
impacted jury diversity with respect to both class and race.1 2 \' The
overwhelming majority of studies on cause challenges focus on the impact
of \"death qualifying\" capital jurors under Witherspoon v. Illinois\"
and Wainwright v. Witt.2 3 As discussed in the previous section, the
Supreme Court held that courts may dismiss potential capital jurors
whose opposition to capital punishment would \"prevent or substantially
impair the performance of\" their duties.\"\' Scholars and lawyers have
frequently raised concerns that the process of \"death qualifying\"
juries would limit diversity, undermine jury community
representativeness, and lead to more punitive juries.\' 5 Death
qualified jurors tend \"to hold more favorable attitudes toward crime
victims, have more negative attitudes toward defendants, see themselves
as similar to crime victims, and perceive the defendant\'s chances of
rehabilitation in prison to be less likely.\"126 These jurors also tend
to focus more on factors that make the defendant\'s crime worse and to
be less able to empathize with some defendants. [Death qualified jurors
are]{.underline} also [whiter]{.underline}. In a large-scale survey of
3,284 jury- eligible Americans conducted in November of 2020, [Black
mock jurors were significantly less likely to satisfy death
qualification requirements]{.underline}.\' 27 In addition, \"[mock
jurors who were more racially biased]{.underline} (as assessed by the
voir dire questions), [more politically conservative, and wealthier,
were more likely to pass death qualification]{.underline}.\"1 28 Mona
Lynch and Craig Haney found that the [death qualification process in
their mock jury study resulted in \"the **significant
underrepresentation** of African American]{.underline}\" mo[ck jurors
and ultimately \"systematically **whitewash\[ed\]** the capital eligible
pool]{.underline}.\"1 29 Lynch and Haney demonstrated that the process
of death qualification resulted in a capital eligible pool that \"does
not represent the views of its community.\"\" 0 Aliza Cover\'s study of
death qualification in eleven capital trials in Louisiana raised a
similar concern.13 1 She found that [Black jurors were removed on the
basis of their death penalty opinions at \"markedly higher
rates]{.underline},\"132 producing qualified capital jury pools that
differed significantly from the summoned venires.1 33 Cover noted that
jurors removed under Witherspoon and Witt \"are excluded not only from
capital jury service in each individual case but also from the
constitutional conversation about whether the death penalty violates the
Eighth Amendment.\"13 1 Jury decisions in capital cases contribute to
the Supreme Court\'s analysis of evolving standards of decency under the
Eighth Amendment.\' Verdicts reached by death-eligible jurors may not
represent wider community norms.\' 36 Extensive research has also
documented the influence of racial discrimination on the exercise of
peremptory strikes and on the ineffectiveness of the framework designed
to counter racial discrimination.\' In death penalty cases, a portion of
peremptory strikes against Black venire members may relate to greater
reluctance to impose the death penalty within this community, but
controlling for death penalty attitudes did not substantially mitigate
the race disparities in one statewide study. 138 This North Carolina
study found that while the expression of death penalty reservations
greatly increased the odds that a prosecutor would strike potential
jurors of any race, Black jurors with death penalty reservations were
still significantly more likely to be struck than their non-Black
counterparts expressing similar views. As noted, several states passed
laws or court rules reforming the Batson test to eliminate the
disproportionate exclusion of potentialjurors based on race or
ethnicity.1 39 These changes typically lower the threshold for a
successful objection and may lead to the seating of more diverse juries.
The study presented in Part IV demonstrates the high costs of the
combined jury selection rules to full democratic participation by
willing citizens in one North Carolina county. Different jury selection
rules serve different purposes, and some- as currently practiced or
potentially after refinement-may be essential to holding a fair trial.
However, practices can become so deeply entrenched that they seem like
the only reasonable way of doing things, rather than reflecting a choice
with real tradeoffs. Our goal here is not to deny the concerns these
rules are designed to address, but to make explicit the real costs of
these practices to diversity and democratic engagement. Viewing these
rules as the products of choices to advance certain objectives over
others reveals the values and priorities of the legal system. IV.

B. Findings This section reports our findings starting with race and
gender disparities that result from requiring excusal of venire members
based on death penalty opinions (\"Witherspoon exclusions\"), then turns
to the race and gender disparities in the state\'s exercise of
peremptory strikes. The final section reports the combined impact of
Witherspoon exclusions and state peremptory strikes on the population of
Black and white venire members.\'5 2 1. Racial and Gender Disparities
Resulting from Witherspoon Exclusions This section reports the race and
gender disparities that result from the operation of rules requiring the
dismissal of venire members because of their opinions on the death
penalty. Table 2 presents the rates at which jurors are removed from the
venire because of their opposition to the death penalty under
Witherspoon v. Illinois and related cases.153 Fifteen percent of the
venire members were excluded because of their opposition to the death
penalty. This decision impacted 192 venire members. Fifty-three venire
members (4%) were excluded because they would automatically impose the
death penalty. [Black]{.underline} venire [members were
excluded]{.underline} for their opposition to the death penalty [at a
**significantly higher** rate than white]{.underline} venire
[members]{.underline}. As reported in Table 2, Column B,
**[27%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [Black venire members were
removed]{.underline} under the Witherspoon rules (65/237) [compared to
**12%** of white venire members]{.underline} (127/1,059).\"4 This is a
relative ratio of 2.25 (27%/12%). The disparity is statistically
significant (p \<.0001). This disparity persists if we focus on venire
members for whom the transcript presents no basis for cause removal
other than failure to be death qualified. This reduces the number of
Witherspoon exclusions from 192 to 182, removing 14% of venire members
overall. [Black venire members were removed for their death penalty
opinions with no other basis for cause removal **25%** of the
time]{.underline} (60/237), [whereas]{.underline} [white]{.underline}
venire [members were removed]{.underline} on this basis with no other
basis for cause removal [**11%** of the time]{.underline} (122/1,059).
The relative rate of dismissal remains over two, at 2.27 (25%/11%). The
disparity remains statistically significant (p \<.0001). We also
calculated the rate at which men and women were excused based on their
death penalty opinions. Women were excluded at a higher rate than men.
In particular, 19% of women (120/640) compared to 11% of men (72/656)
were death disqualified. This relative disparity is statistically
significant, but smaller than that observed for race: 1.73 (19%/11%) (p
\< .001). The gender disparity is concentrated among the Black women who
appeared for jury duty in these cases. Table 3, Column B, reports that
36% of [Black women were excluded]{.underline} under Witherspoon for
their opinions about the death penalty (47/131). This rate is [**2.4**
times the 15% overall rate of]{.underline} Witherspoon
[exclusions]{.underline} in this study (36%/15%) [and **3.0 times** the
12% rate of all other venire members]{.underline} (145/1,165). The
disparity is statistically significant (p \< .001). It is higher than we
identified for any other race-gender combination in separate analysis.
The cost of removals required under Witherspoon v. Illinois and related
cases had a large and disparate impact on the ability of Black citizens
in general and Black women in particular to participate in these capital
juries. 2. Racial and Gender Disparities in the Impact of State
Peremptory Strikes As noted above, research has demonstrated the ongoing
significance of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges.\'5 7 This
section presents the rate at which prosecutors exercised peremptory
challenges against Black versus white venire members when they had the
opportunity to strike. As noted, North Carolina rules provide fourteen
peremptory strikes to each side in a capital jury selection.1 58 This
analysis is limited to those venire members who were \"strike eligible\"
to the prosecutors.1 59 As earlier North Carolina research found,
[prosecutors]{.underline} in Wake County [struck Black venire members at
a **significantly higher** rate than white venire members]{.underline}.1
61 Table 4, Column B, reports that [state strikes removed **51%** of
eligible Black venire members]{.underline} (38/75) [compared to
25%]{.underline} (93/366) [of eligible white venire
members]{.underline}. [The relative strike ratio is
**2.04**]{.underline} (51%/25%). This disparity is statistically
significant (p \< .0001). We replicated the gender analysis presented in
Subsection i but did not observe disparities in prosecutorial exercises
of peremptory strikes against all women. We did, however, observe
significant disparities in strikes against Black women. 162 Table 5
shows that the state removed 55% of eligible Black women with peremptory
strikes (17/31) compared to 28% of all other venire members (114/410).
This is a relative strike ratio of 1.96. This disparity is statistically
significant (p \< .01). 3. Combined Impact of Witherspoon Exclusions and
State Peremptory Strikes by Race Section 3 presents the combined effect
of death qualification and state peremptory strikes on the participation
in these capital juries by Black citizens. Table 6 collects information
presented in previous tables to illustrate the combined impact of the
Ideology of Jury Selection in these cases. Column B reports the number
of Black and white venire members in the study overall. Remember that
this starting point underrepresented Black venire members relative to
their presence in the community. Column C presents the actual number of
Black and white venire members removed under Witherspoon. Column D
presents the actual number of Black and white venire members removed by
state peremptory strikes. Column E combines the number of venire members
removed under Witherspoon with those removed by state strikes and
presents the total number of Black and white venire members excluded
from jury service. Finally, Column F presents the number of Black and
white venire members in the reduced population. Table 6 also presents
basic calculations concerning the cumulative impact of these decisions
on jury diversity. Column G shows that [Black venire members were
removed at more than twice the rate of white venire members
(43%/21%).]{.underline} This may be in part because Black venire members
make up only 18% of the initial venire (Column B), but [removals of
Black venire members constitute **32%** of the total
removals]{.underline} (Column E), almost [**twice** the rate of their
presence in the overall population]{.underline}. Moving to the second
row in the same columns, removals of [white venire members, by contrast,
constitute 68% of total removals, a rate more than 14 percentage points
lower than their representation in the initial venire
(82%).]{.underline} The cumulative effect of the death qualification
process and the state\'s exercise of peremptory strikes meant that
[Black potential jurors were removed at almost **twice** the rate of
their representation in the population of potential jurors]{.underline}
(1.8 times, 32%/18%), [whereas white potential jurors were removed at
0.8 times their rate]{.underline} (68%/82%). Figure 1 illustrates this
change. The findings of this study echo earlier findings and illustrate
the magnitude of the cumulative costs to diversity of jury selection
rules. Transcripts from jury selection in these cases illustrate the
extent to which the rules authorizing removal of potential jurors based
on their death penalty opinions and the availability of a large number
of peremptory strikes operate as accepted but consequential parts of the
process. Prosecutors and defense counsel raise arguments about whether a
potential juror\'s opinions qualify for removal under Witherspoon
without challenging the overall cost of this inquiry to the democratic
jury ideal. Peremptory challenges quietly backstop and expand
Witherspoon\'s reach-allowing prosecutors to remove even those whose
opinions satisfy the constitutional standards for allowable concerns
about capital punishment.1 64 This practice puts the rules for selecting
capital juries in direct tension with our democracy ideals. V. A
COLLISION OF IDEOLOGIES THAT HARMS JURY DEMOCRACY Section II reviews
research documenting the costs of current jury selection procedures
generally, and jury selection in capital cases in particular, to the
diversity of seated juries. Section IV presents the results of a new
study documenting similar results and showing the cumulative costs of
the Ideology of Jury Selection in one county. This Section collects
evidence documenting the costs of the predictable lack of diversity that
undermines the vibrancy valued under Ideology of Jury Democracy.
Diversity enhances the quality of deliberation.\' 65 These benefits
include the opportunity to present and discuss differing interpretations
of the evidence or even varying memories about the details of the case.1
66 For example, Sommers used a mock jury experiment to examine \"the
processes through which racial diversity influences group decision
making.\"167 Study subjects, recruited from an actual jury pool of
people responding to jury summons, deliberated in heterogeneous groups
(four white and two Black mock jurors) or homogeneous groups (six white
jurors). In this study, \"heterogeneous groups deliberated longer and
considered a wider range of information than did homogeneous groups.\"1
68 Sommers also observed that white participants in heterogeneous groups
raised more case facts, made fewer factual errors, and engaged more
comfortably in race-related issues.1 69 Subsequent research has
documented ways in which \"diversity provides diverse perspectives, and
also promotes perspective taking.\" It \"increases people\'s tendency to
process information more deeply\" and \"can raise their tolerance of
ambiguity and open-endedness.\" 70 Alternately stated, [diversity of
perspective reduces the risk of biased outcomes because the range of
views expressed prevents one dominant view from determining the
outcome]{.underline}. [Diversity means **accountability**]{.underline}:
people process facts more deeply because [there are voices that
challenge the prevailing status quo and assumptions about defendants and
victims]{.underline}. [These qualities enhance]{.underline} the
[truth-seeking]{.underline} function of the jury inherent to the
Ideology of Jury Democracy. The persistent harms to jury diversity that
arise from the hegemonic Ideology of Jury Selection- from decisions
about assembling jury summons lists, to the failure to accommodate
situations that require hardship removals, to race disparities in the
exercise of cause excusals and peremptory strikes\'\'-never stand out in
higher relief than they do in this respect. A second important cost of a
lack of diversity arises from the juries\' role as a check on government
power. [Juries lacking in diversity have been found to be **more**
**punitive**]{.underline}.\' 2 A jury that is more punitive than the
community in which it sits is simply less well prepared to carry out
this role. Shamena Anwar and colleagues collected information on 300,000
individuals who responded to jury summons for felony trials in Harris
County, Texas. They observed that [Black defendants were much more
likely to be convicted and to receive more severe punishments when
juries had a higher share of residents from predominantly white and
high-income neighborhoods]{.underline}. They also documented that
[residents from these neighborhoods tended to be substantially
overrepresented on juries]{.underline}. 173 A second study from the same
research team looked at the impact of the racial composition of jury
pools on trial outcomes in felony trials [[in
Florida]{.underline}]{.mark} between 2000 and 2010.14 This comparison
was possible because [**[36%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the [jury pools had no Black members]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scholars
found that [juries formed from all-[white jury pools]{.mark}
[convicted]{.mark} [Black defendants **sixteen percent**]{.mark} [more
frequently]{.mark} than white defendants]{.underline}. They also found
that this disparity in outcome disappeared entirely when the jury pool
included at least one Black member. This research builds on earlier
research concluding [that [lack of diversity]{.mark} can [**exacerbate**
a racial gap in conviction]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[rates]{.underline}]{.mark}.17 5 [This harm to diversity of
perspectives can arise from the removal of candidate jurors based on
widely accepted grounds]{.underline}. Emily Shaw and colleagues studied
the importance of racial diversity when judging the strength and quality
of evidence presented in criminal cases.1 ? 6 Their 2021 study examined
whether attitudes and beliefs about law enforcement help explain the
racial gap among jurors in support for conviction.\' 77 Participants
were presented with a hypothetical federal drug conspiracy case in which
the race of the FBI informant-whose testimony was a major part of the
government\'s case-varied. The authors found [[Black
participants]{.mark} significantly [less likely to convict]{.mark} than
white participants]{.underline}, especially when exposed to the white
informant condition. [Black participants also rated the law enforcement
witness as less credible and viewed police more
negatively]{.underline}.7 \"\' Shaw and colleagues caution, however,
against using this finding to justify excluding skeptical jurors from
service because \"[removing jurors due to their skepticism about the
police runs a high risk of seating a biased jury]{.underline}.\"1 79
They continue that \"our findings suggest that the [[legal
processes]{.mark} that are used to excuse jurors from
service]{.underline}, either peremptorily or for cause, need to be
reconsidered to ensure that views of police, including those rooted in
actual experience or knowledge about problems with fair and just
policing, [are not used to disproportionately [exclude persons of
color]{.mark}, or [to seat juries]{.mark} [**overrepresented** by people
who **blindly trust**]{.mark} and support
[police]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 180 Removing jurors based on their views
of police-that is, by favoring jurors who have never had a negative
interaction with police-prioritizes the existing power structures
wherein the hegemonic Ideology of Jury Selection dominates.1 81
Similarly, the practice of peremptory strikes against
potentialjurors-who have not been excused for cause and have therefore
been deemed acceptable by the judge-privilege litigants\' rights over
those of citizens to participate in the. democratic function of the
jury.182 That [parties can exercise peremptory strikes for **any
reason**]{.underline}-bar race, gender, or ethnicity-\"[**no matter**
how \'implausible or fantastic]{.underline},\"\' suggests that
idealistic notions about the jury\'s role in participatory democracy are
subordinate to litigants\' rights to exercise control over who can and
cannot take part.183 This is not necessarily a problem; the interests of
a defendant facing the prospect of a criminal conviction outweigh those
of a prospective juror whose biases or personal connection to the case
would render them partial. But the choice to allow parties to strike for
even reasons that have no basis in fact or logic demonstrates just how
readily ideals of democratic participation yield to other values. [The
higher rates of opposition among Black citizens to capital punishment
have historically led to their [disproportionate removal]{.mark}
from]{.underline} [juries]{.underline}, [[contributing
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the production of [**[homogeneous]{.underline}**
[juries]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"\' Given this, the process of removing
potential jurors based on their death-penalty attitudes leads to a
\"demographic dilemma\" where [the \"[lack of support for the death
penalty]{.mark} among African Americans compromises the composition of
capital juries in such a way that the capital sentencing process
[threatens to]{.mark} become a system in which minority jurors are
[excluded]{.mark} [from]{.mark} this critical aspect of [the]{.mark}
criminal justice [process **altogether**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"1 85
Witherspoon exclusions have the potential to impact diversity of
perspectives in other respects as well.1 86 On top of Witherspoon, the
exalted view of juries as fundamental to democratic participation
conflicts with a deep mistrust of jurors themselves. As Laura Gaston
Dooley argues, trial lawyers are trained to look upon jurors as fickle
and easily swayed by superficial factors such as an attorney\'s
mannerisms and clothing. 187 Capital jurors have direct influence on
both guilt and sentencing decisions in the cases in which they serve.
Juries\' decisions also contribute to how reviewing courts interpret the
Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court established more than a century ago
that the Eighth Amendment\'s prohibition on cruel and usual punishment
derives its meaning in part from public opinion that may evolve or
change \"as public opinion becomes enlightened by humane justice.\"188
The Court emphasized its commitment to measuring \"evolving standards of
decency\" in determining the constitutionality of the death penalty in
Gregg v. Georgia.189 The GreggCourt sought to identify \"objective
indicia that reflect the public attitude,\"190 noting that the \"jury ..
. is a significant and reliable objective index of contemporary values,
because it is so directly involved\" in the administration of capital
punishment.1 9 \' The Court has looked to patterns in capital jury
decisions as part of its evolving standards of decency analysis in
decisions limiting the execution of intellectually disabled
defendants,\' 92 prohibiting the execution of juveniles,1 93 and
repeatedly limiting the death penalty to homicide cases.\'94 But that
process necessarily excludes essential information about public
attitudes and values when jury selection procedures lead to juries that
are more likely to convict or issue death sentences, or that are less
representative of society\'s opinions.1 95 As such, the selection
procedures create a skewed picture that imposes an independent cost to
constitutional interpretation itself. This process also undermines the
expected authority of juries under the Ideology of Jury Democracy. For
example, Cohen and Smith note that at the time of the founding, a
potential juror\'s \"view on the constitutionality of a particular law .
. . marked an important component of society\'s deliberative
process.\"\' 96 They suggest that cause strikes undermine the
deliberative process needed to give the jury its full and expected
role.19! \"Far from being a prohibited \'bias\',\" they argue, \"the
jury\'s beliefs on the appropriateness of the law or its punishment
served an important function both in the English system and in ours at
common law.\"\'9 8 Similarly, Frampton notes that the \"version of the
\'impartial jury\' that now reigns in American criminal
procedure-distant, dispassionate, ignorant of the parties and
allegations- contrasts with the \'local jury\' that predominated \... at
the country\'s founding.\"1 99 This concern parallels Carroll\'s image
of jury democracy where the jurors play an essential role in \"grounding
the law in the living world of the citizens whose obedience it
commands.\"200 Current jury selection methods not only distort
information communicated to the Court regarding evolving standards of
decency, but they also send a troubling message to the public about the
value of their participation. Justice and Meares conceptualize the costs
in terms of procedural justice of the \"[[disproportionate
exclusion]{.mark} and inclusion of various groups in
society]{.underline},\" noting that \"[this cherished]{.underline} (if
impotent) form of [civic education [sends a **clear message**]{.mark}
that [some people are worthy citizens whose]{.mark} opinions and
[judgments are valued]{.mark}, [while]{.mark} other [citizens\' views
**do not count**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 20 \' [[These exclusions
undermine public confidence]{.mark} in jury decision making and, in
turn, [in]{.mark} public confidence in [the justice]{.mark}
[system]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline}. 2 02 The pervasive Ideology of
Jury Selection harms the system as a whole. The following section notes
initiatives that introduce \"productive discourse\" that challenges the
hegemonic ideology and protects democratic engagement. 203 VI. AVENUES
TO RECENTER THE IDEOLOGY OF JURY DEMOCRACY

#### Excluding black jurors otherizes the black experience causing follow-on police discrimination

**Paulose 22** \[Rachel Kunjummen Paulose, Visiting Professor at the
University of St. Thomas School of Law, a former United States Attorney,

Law Must Protect Minorities\' Right to Judge," Berkley Journal of
Criminal Law,
https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/bjcl27&i=301\]/Kankee

Still, key differences in perception persist. About two-thirds of Black
people have experienced racially discriminatory situations where they
were treated with suspicion, whereas only one-quarter of white people
have expressed similar concerns.144 Black people are five times more
likely than white people to assert they have been racially profiled by
police. 145 Black people\'s ratings of police competence are far lower
than those of white people. 146 Most white Republicans dispute the
notion that police treat Black people unfairly. 147 Even amongst police
officers, views regarding racism in policing vary dramatically based on
the race of the officer. 148 Yet self-described conservatives, including
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, have acknowledged the existence of implicit
bias in the legal system. 149 However, [the juror selection process
reflects none of this reality]{.underline}. [The [jury]{.mark}
[selection]{.mark} system presently [reflects only the **Anglo**
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The minority perspective is viewed
as **inherently biased**]{.underline}]{.mark}.150 [[When a person of
color]{.mark} truthfully [describes]{.mark} [her experience]{.mark},
e.g., being profiled by law enforcement, [she is **automatically**
categorized as biased]{.mark} against law enforcement]{.underline} when
in fact she has simply repeated what is well established as fact: as a
group, people of color, particularly Black men, are targeted by law
enforcement in ways that white people are not. Similar
[questions]{.underline} [during voir dire]{.underline} questions
touching on how people perceive law enforcement, if they have had any
prior contacts with law enforcement, and whether they know anyone who
has been arrested, indicted, convicted, or jailed [all are likely to
lead to different answers by people of color than white people because
of the systemic bias of police]{.underline}. [[By **otherizing** the
minority perspective]{.mark}, [the law has perpetuated
**discrimination**]{.mark} that has gone largely [**unchallenged** in
the courtroom]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 1 [In other words, [the law
demands]{.mark} that [people have a **monolithic**]{.mark} experience,
the [white experience]{.mark}, [or otherwise be labeled
\"biased]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" [[This discrimination]{.mark} also
[justifies and perpetuates police discrimination against people of

#### Racialized poverty causes a disparate impact for summons rolls, jury now-shows, and juror challenges -- all ensure juries will be majority white, deepening racial harms

A. Cause Challenges Are an UnderstudiedMechanism for Juror Exclusion
[The process]{.underline} by which ordinary people are empaneled as
jurors is one that [is]{.underline} **[stacked]{.underline}**, **[at
every turn]{.underline}**, [against the]{.underline} [poor]{.underline}.
The first exclusionary juncture lies at the creation of [[source
lists]{.underline}]{.mark} from which jurors are summoned to court.\"
Though the JSSA attempted to make such rolls more inclusive, many states
today [use]{.underline} Department of Motor Vehicles
([DMV]{.underline})-generated [lists limited to those with a [driver\'s
license]{.mark}, registered voters, [or]{.mark} those with a [voting
record]{.mark}]{.underline}.78 In an effort to expand these lists,
California may soon become the latest state, joining seventeen before
it, to include tax records as a way to access a broader sample of
eligible jurors. 79 Still, as long as [people who are [poor are
**underrepresented**]{.mark}]{.underline} in these expanded source
lists, [the process of assembling juror]{.underline} [lists will remain
a **site of exclusion**]{.underline}. The next point of attrition for
prospective jurors who face financial hardship, after source lists are
compiled and jurors are summoned, is their arrival to court. On average,
9% of summoned jurors will fail to respond to their summonses-with a
rate in some states as high as 50%.80 Though some judges have attempted
to enforce compliance by issuing warrants for \"Failure to Appear\" or
putting a lien on the property of those who do not show up, this
approach is by no means universal. 81 Upon receipt of a summons,
prospective jurors can often respond with proof that there is a reason
they should not appear in court in advance of their date of service. 82
Jurors can also seek excusal from jury service by completing written
questionnaires which they can submit to the court by mail in advance.8 3
Jurors may also be dismissed from service after reporting to court in
person. Though it is possible for an attorney to challenge the
composition of a jury panel, or venire,84 in practice there are two
predominant ways that jurors are relieved of their duty: Through
peremptory challenges and through cause challenges. 85 Both routes of
juror excusal take place during an extended period of juror questioning,
known as voir dire, during which attorneys and judges question jurors
about their ability to serve. 86 Cause challenges, which can be
exercised by judges without restriction, are the first and most
significant means by which racial disparities are introduced to
empaneled juries.8 7 One function of the cause challenge is to excuse
citizens the judge believes harbor biases that might prevent them from
fairly and impartially assessing evidence. 88 Recognizing that one\'s
right to an impartial jury is an integral part of the American legal
system, 89 cause challenges are perceived to be an essential strategic
resource for litigants; 90 they promote the removal of jurors who appear
as though they cannot follow legal instructions or assess evidence
fairly.91 In practice, judges dismiss jurors for cause for a variety of
reasons. In the federal context, for example, Rule 24 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs jury selection, has widely
been interpreted as affording judges broad discretion to determine the
parameters and types of questions asked of prospective jurors.92 In
civil cases, judges exercise similar discretion to identify prospective
jurors who might have a prejudicial personal relationship with an
attorney or party in a case.9 3 To the extent that a prospective juror
has adverse interests that involve a party in the case, or a suit
pending in the same court involving similar questions of fact, the
removal of such jurors for cause is also common.94 In addition to
addressing potential sources of bias, cause challenges are used to
excuse jurors who fail to meet legal qualifications to participate. 95
Though restrictions on eligibility vary by jurisdiction, they generally
require American citizenship and residency in the county from which one
is summoned, a minimum and maximum age, English language proficiency,
and the absence of a prior felony conviction. 96 Of particular
significance, [[judges]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[**[frequently]{.mark}** exercise cause challenges to [remove
jurors]{.mark} who [indicate]{.mark} that [financial impediments]{.mark}
would constrain their ability to serve as jurors]{.underline}.97
Jurisdictional hardship guidance, however, does not provide a precise or
consistent definition of financial hardship. In the federal context,
jurors seeking direction from the U.S. Courts Administrative Office in
Washington, D.C., which maintains a website, can expect to find little
helpful information. The site notes that under the Jury Act, courts can
excuse jurors on the basis of \"undue hardship or extreme
inconvenience,\" which can be requested in writing.98 The criteria for
seeking such an excuse, however, are not specified. Assessments of
hardship excuses, among other rationales for a cause dismissal, lie at
the sole discretion of the judge.99 Cause challenge determinations are
also rarely appealed, as the standard of review is abuse of discretion.0
0 The next Part of this Article will demonstrate that judges\' cause
challenge determinations are highly variable, with some showing
deference to jurors\' concerns, and others insisting that financial
hardship should not warrant excusal.\' 0\' Lawyers who wish to preserve
an error for argument on appeal are thus sometimes required to use
peremptory challenges to excuse jurors they feel should have been
removed for cause.10 2 Unlike peremptory challenges, which are limited
in number and subject to anti-discrimination law, 03 cause challenges
are theoretically limitless.0 4 And [the [dismissal]{.mark} of
prospective jurors for reasons of financial hardship]{.underline},
though seemingly benevolent, [can]{.underline} effectively
**[[purge]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the venire of [jurors who]{.mark}
[defense attorneys view as advantageous]{.mark} to their
clients]{.underline}.10 5 In one case, for example, a defendant argued-
unsuccessfully-that [[hardship challeng]{.mark}es were used to
[**selectively remove** Black]{.mark} prospective [jurors]{.mark} with
childcare commitments]{.underline}, even as White prospective jurors
raised the same concern.1 06 This practice recalls the selective
application of property requirements to fill venires with non-
propertied White prospective jurors and serves as an important reminder
that any discussion of undoing socio-economic exclusion is in the United
States also a discussion of undoing race-based exclusion. B. Cause
Challenge Dismissals DisparatelyExclude Jurorsof Color Judges\' uses of
cause challenges to excuse prospective jurors who raise hardship
concerns results in juries that are socio-economically and racially
homogenous. Past studies have focused on the extent to which [inquiries
into juror bias can lead to the [disparate dismissal of jurors]{.mark}
[of color]{.mark}-sometimes [based on]{.mark} past [criminal
**convictions**]{.mark}**1**]{.underline} 07 [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
even **[[arrest records]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 08 It is particularly
notable, in light of the American jury system\'s fraught racial history,
that the **[[racialized]{.underline}]{.mark}** experience of
[**[poverty]{.underline}** [has been absent]{.underline}]{.mark} [from
scholarship on jury demographics]{.underline} while featuring so
prominently in hearings on the Jury Selection and Service Act of
1968.109 According to the Pew Research Center, [White families in the
United States have a net worth that is on average **thirteen times**
greater than that of families of color]{.underline}.\" [The poverty rate
among Black and Hispanic Americans in 2019 was 18.8% and
15.7%,]{.underline} respectively[, as compared to the 7.3% poverty rate
among non-Hispanic White Americans]{.underline}.\"\' [White citizens are
also more likely than citizens of color to own their own
cars]{.underline}\" 2 [and homes.\"]{.underline}1 3 The consequences of
this disparity for jury representativeness cannot be overlooked. One
variable that may account for disparate juror summons response rates,
for example, is the fact that [[renters]{.mark} tend to [live at an
address for **shorter** periods of time]{.mark} [and]{.mark} may [fail
to update the address]{.mark} on their driver\'s license each time they
move-both of which lead to less inclusive juror lists]{.underline}.\" 4
Research suggests that [[disparities]{.mark} in the number of
individuals who report for jury service, [based on race]{.mark}, often
[correspond to]{.mark} concern about the [financial consequences]{.mark}
of participating]{.underline}.\" 5 In Dallas, Texas, in the early 2000s,
for example, The Dallas Morning News and SMU Law Review conducted a
comprehensive study of jury participation in the county.! 1 According to
that study, [**four out of five** people summoned for jury service did
not show up, and Hispanic residents in particular were
under-represented]{.underline}.1 7 In a county in which [more than **one
in four** citizens was Hispanic]{.underline} during the period in
question, [only **one in fourteen** jury service participants was
Hispanic]{.underline}.\" 8\' And [while **40%** of the population lived
in households earning \$35,000 or less, only **13%** of this population
participated in jury service]{.underline}.\" 9 Beyond this data, which
suggest that [jury no-shows]{.underline} may [stem]{.underline}, in
part, [from citizens\' concerns about the financial consequences of
participation]{.underline},120 research participants completed surveys
that revealed striking disparities. In particular,
[**[twice]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}]{.mark} [[many Hispanic
respondents]{.mark} as White respondents [found it difficult to spend
time away from work]{.mark} during jury duty, and more than [**19%** of
Hispanic]{.mark} persons [and **17%** of]{.mark} [Black Americans
earned]{.mark} **[no wages]{.mark}** if they reported to court [for jury
service]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[compared to **5%**]{.mark} [of White
citizens]{.mark} surveyed.]{.underline}121 There is evidence that the
economic impact of the **[[COVID]{.mark}-19]{.underline}** pandemic has
[[exacerbated]{.mark} the racial and socio-economic [disparities]{.mark}
that continue to plague juries]{.underline}. A June 2020 informal survey
of potential jurors in Dallas and Houston, for example, indicated that
[more Black and Hispanic potential jurors reported economic hardships if
summoned for jury duty, and were also more likely to work in hospitals
or other areas of increased viral exposure]{.underline}.122 When [a
Zoom]{.underline}-based [virtual jury]{.underline} was later summoned
for a criminal trial in Travis County, Texas, which encompasses the city
of Austin, **[73%]{.underline}** [of empaneled jurors self-reported
their race as White and **83%** self-reported having a post-graduate or
college degree]{.underline}.1 23 U.S. Census data indicates, in
contrast, that [fewer than 50% of Travis County residents are either
White or possess advanced degrees]{.underline}.124 This research
demonstrates that legal scholars committed to eliminating racism from
the American legal system must confront socio- economic disparities and
their attendant forms of exclusion in our juries. In practice, [people
of color are removed from jury venires long before peremptory challenges
are exercised; even in the absence of explicit racial animus or bias,
financial hardship stands as a **persistent obstacle** to representative
jury participation]{.underline}. The consequences of this are
significant. In addition to violating a person\'s constitutional right
to serve as a juror,25 [the functional exclusion of people of color
undermines public confidence]{.underline} [in the jury
trial]{.underline},126 [as well as in the accuracy of
verdicts]{.underline}.1 27 In fact, empirical research suggests that
jury deliberations are less satisfying for poor and historically
underrepresented jurors, including those who are Black and Hispanic,
than for White jurors regardless of class.12 In Taylor v. Louisiana,129
the Supreme Court specifically noted that [public confidence in the
trial system depended on the perceived fairness of jury selection
procedures]{.underline} that ensured the broadest levels of
participation possible.1 30 While public confidence is a worthy goal in
and of itself, the stakes of jury exclusion may be greatest for criminal
defendants. There is an abundance of psychological research, for
example, indicating that [deliberative bodies with broad representation
have longer and more substantive discussions of evidence due to the
confluence of different perspectives.]{.underline}131 Another study
found that [jury demographics affected participation during
deliberation: All-White (mock) juries tend to be dominated by White
males while White females are less talkative and perceived as less
persuasive]{.underline}.1 32 [When jurors of color were
introduced]{.underline} to the mock panel, this dynamic changed; [women
became more active participants and their contributions were more
impactful]{.underline}.133 With respect to guilty verdicts, a study has
shown that [White jurors are more likely to convict than Black jurors in
cases involving Black defendants on trial for violent
crimes]{.underline}.1 34 This may result, in part, from Black jurors\'
greater awareness (and experience) with the inequities of the criminal
justice system.1 3 5 It may also result from the prejudicial tendencies
of predominantly White juries. Studies have also highlighted the varying
effect of jury demographics on the outcomes of different types of
criminal cases.1 36 One such study, based on North Carolina data,
determined that [juries with more than one Black male member were more
likely to acquit defendants]{.underline}.1 37 [White
j]{.underline}uries, in contrast, [were found to more often convict
Black defendants in cases with White victims]{.underline}.1 38 Scholars
have also highlighted instances in which reliance on racial stereotypes
about jurors\' likely sympathies when empaneling jurors of color have
been unfounded and prejudicial in and of themselves. 13 [Ensuring that
jurors from diverse backgrounds are empaneled thus not only improves the
public perception of the legal system, but influences the deliberative
process by effectuating a more fulsome and measured review of
evidence]{.underline}. The foregoing shows that despite a record of
demonstrable progress, the American jury system remains vulnerable to
socio-economic exclusion. [[Keeping]{.mark} [people]{.mark} who are poor
[out]{.mark} of venires [**deepens** the **marginalization** of]{.mark}
already [underrepresented groups]{.mark}]{.underline}, [resulting in
juries that are neither socio-economically nor racially representative
of American society]{.underline}. [[This is an affront to the
**Constitution**]{.underline}]{.mark} [which]{.underline}, under Batson,
[protects a person\'s **right to serve as a juror**]{.underline}. 4 It
also prevents empaneled jurors from feeling that they can speak and be
heard. But a review of the ideal-typical process\' 4 \' of assessing and
challenging jurors does not offer a full picture of how things unfold in
practice. In Part III, I draw on my own extended empirical studies of
jury selection to offer an innovative look at socio-economic exclusion
in real time. In particular, I identify the central role that
benevolence plays as a common rationale for exclusion. In the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries the link between property, ability, and
moral aptitude served to make socio-economic exclusion not only
thinkable to its advocates but right and good. Today, I argue, the view
of jury service as an impossible burden for those who are poor, and
excusal from it as an act of benevolence, once more makes exclusion of
certain people not only thinkable but right and good. Further, as I will
discuss in the final section of this Article, the view of jury service
as a burden for people who are poor and excusal as an act of benevolence
reifies the jury system as something unchangeable, rather than a living
system in which the financial consequences of service might be reduced,
eliminated, or turned positive, by compensating jurors at a level that
befits the importance of the service they render. III. AN EMPIRICAL CASE

INTRODUCTION The most-watched trial of 2021 was likely that of Derek
Chauvin, the officer who murdered George Floyd.1 Jury selection took
over a week, in part because so many potential jurors had seen the video
of Chauvin, a White police officer, with his knee on the neck of Floyd,
a Black2 man, for over eight minutes.3 The issue of race was front and
center during Chauvin\'s jury selection.4 The defense attorney began
jury questioning by telling each juror that the case is not about
\"race.\" 5 Yet, empirical research and the social response to the trial
told a different story: many studies document unjust outcomes for Black
individuals in the legal system; 6 the Innocence Project has long
documented the impact of race on criminal cases; 7 and the protestors
outside Chauvin\'s trial were advocating for racial justice.8 Across the
United States, [[jury selection contributes to **structural**]{.mark}
**[racism]{.mark}** in the legal system [and]{.mark} to [unjust outcomes
for Black defendants]{.mark} and victims in]{.underline} both
[criminal]{.underline} and civil [contexts]{.underline}. 9 Though
progress has been made, existing legal tools and policies fail to
adequately address this issue. The complex social and psychological
factors at play in jury selection call for interdisciplinary solutions
to equip lawyers and judges with the ability to identify and challenge
racial bias in potential jurors. To date, efforts to root out systemic
racism injury selection and deliberations have mainly focused on
increasing jury diversity. 10 One vivid example of how important jury
diversity is to ensure racially just outcomes in the United States is
the case of civil rights activist Medgar Evers. [In 1963]{.underline},
Evers, [a]{.underline} thirty-seven- year-old [Black man, was
killed]{.underline} right outside his own home [by]{.underline} a member
of [the **Ku Klux Klan**]{.underline}, Byron de la Beckwith.\" The State
of [Mississippi]{.underline} [unsuccessfully prosecuted de la Beckwith
twice]{.underline} in 1964.12 Each time the [all-White juries failed
to]{.underline} unanimously [agree on conviction]{.underline}, resulting
in a hung jury.13 In de la Beckwith\'s second trial, the Mississippi
State Sovereignty Commission used state resources to help the defense
identify and select sympathetic jurors during voir dire. This
interference was only discovered in 1989 by a reporter. 14 [It was
not]{.underline} until de la Beckwith\'s third trial in 1994, after new
evidence was introduced, that [a racially diverse jury]{.underline}
including both Black and White jurors finally [convicted de la Beckwith
of first-degree murder]{.underline}.\' 5 By the time of the [third
trial, Byron de la Beckwith had admitted shooting Evers,
and]{.underline} he was generally believed to be guilty of the crime. It
is likely, although cannot be shown with statistical causal certainty,
that [the changed racial make-up of the third jury contributed to their
ability to reach a unanimous conviction]{.underline}. More recent
studies show that [[diverse juries **deliberate longer**]{.mark} than
all-White juries [and consider more facts and make **fewer
errors**]{.mark}.]{.underline}1 6 [[Diversifying juries]{.mark} by race
also [positively affects decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
recently shown in a study of mock juries. 7 From a psychology
perspective, however, selecting a jury that will not let racism
influence their deliberation and verdict is more complex than simply
ensuring diverse racial representation. For example, while some White
individuals can be fairly easily identified as holding racist viewpoints
(e.g., willingness to say they believe Black people have more criminal
tendencies than others), others have implicit biases. 18 Aversive
racism, a psychological term for outwardly presenting as unbiased while
still thinking and acting in a racially biased manner,1 9 is more
difficult to identify in prospective jurors. Moreover, implicit bias is
not confined to White jurors. For example, Black jurors can also
manifest internalized racism, a form of implicit bias that can also
affect their deliberations. 20 In addition, non-racist bystanders can
include people who may be more easily influenced in deliberations by
White people with explicit or implicit bias, while others may be White
racial justice allies who will effortfully focus on the facts of the
case without allowing racism to pervade their decision-making process.2
Therefore, the confluence of a juror\'s attitudes and behaviors towards
different races and racism should be the focus in creating an impartial
jury rather than simply the juror\'s race. Many legal sources providing
advice about how to conduct voir dire to identify jurors whose racial
prejudice render them unable to impartially decide the case are decades
old and now outdated because our understanding of racism has evolved and
manifestations of racism have changed over the years. 2 2 Lawyers and
judges consulting available legal sources may be confused by
contradictory advice. For example, different Supreme Court Justices hold
different opinions about whether lawyers should directly raise race on
voir dire and, if so, what questions to ask.23 Legal sources providing
advice to lawyers performing jury selection and voir dire suggest
numerous approaches and questions, some of which contradict each
other.24 Many of these sources are behind paywalls or are academic in
nature, making any helpful questions they propose less readily available
to public-interest attorneys.2 5 Thus, a new approach is needed, one
based on current science and that is readily accessible. Insights from
the field of psychology are valuable resources for judges and attorneys
who must determine whether a juror should be removed because of racial
bias. Social science explains that when jurors deliberate and make
decisions, several demographic, social, and psychological factors are
involved, including explicit and implicit racial biases, cultural norms,
and group behavior. 26 Psychologists and other social scientists offer
attorneys evidence- based 27 means to identify jurors who will not be
impartial due to racial bias or a demonstrated history of racial
stereotyping. 28 Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this Article will
assist judges and lawyers in selecting a jury that is more likely to be
impartial and unaffected by racial bias. This Article is designed to
serve as a launching point for researchers, as well as legal
professionals, who see the value of bringing psychological research and
leanings into their legal work and would like to cultivate a more
well-informed and effective approach to anti-racism in the justice
system. Part I provides background about the problem of racial bias in
the U.S. legal system, specifically in the jury selection process. Part
II provides background about the mechanics of jury selection and the
existing tools to combat racism in jury deliberations. Part III
describes psychological insights on racism and provides a taxonomy of
different forms of racism. Part IV explains the types of questions
judges and attorneys can ask in voir dire or in jury selection
questionnaires to identify different types of racism and enable a
challenge for cause or, at a minimum, use of a peremptory challenge. The
Article concludes with suggestions for further research and proposed
questions that attorneys and judges can use to implement the findings of
this Article. I. HISTORY OF RACISM IN THE UNITED STATES LEGAL SYSTEM
This Part provides an overview of the history of systemic racism in the
U.S. legal system and describes how [systemic racism directly impacts
jury selection]{.underline}. However, racism permeates all aspects of
the American legal system and results in disparate and unfair treatment
of Black Americans. 29 While this Part uses Black American history as an
exemplar, it is not intended to erase the racism experienced by other
people of color in the United States. A. The Role of Race in the U.S.
Legal System andJury Selection Due to the country\'s long history of
racism, race matters in the context of the U.S. justice system,30
including the process of jury selection. 31 [From independence through
the Civil War, jury participation was **almost entirely** restricted to
White men]{.underline}. 32 After the Civil War, the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments abolished chattel slavery and
guaranteed basic civil rights regardless of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude for those who are not incarcerated. 33 Despite
these legal advancements, many government officials directly excluded
Black Americans from jury selection for another century after the
Reconstruction Era.34 Furthermore, Black people were still subject to
discrimination and harsh acts of violence through the enactment of
government- sanctioned racial discrimination, such as Jim Crow laws.35
Jim Crow laws were enacted beginning in 1877 to limit the freedom of
Black Americans by \"dictating all aspects of the ex-slaves\' lives,
from work hours and duties to behaviors.\"36 For example, Jim Crow laws
prohibited Black people from entering certain towns and cities, required
literacy tests and poll taxes for Black voters, and required separate
schools for White and Black children. 37 As a result, Black Americans
were ostracized, their voices were marginalized, and their right to vote
was suppressed. In other words, these laws enforced racial segregation
and maintained long-lasting inequalities among Black and White
Americans. 38 Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which outlawed
race-based discrimination in jury selection, Black people have
historically been excluded from juries. 39 For example, the literacy
tests required by Jim Crow laws prevented Black people from civil
engagement because they excluded them from the voting polls, which is
one of the main sources of jurors.40 Some laws were more explicit, like
West Virginia\'s outright ban on Black jurors. Fortunately, the Supreme
Court overturned this law in Strauder v. West Virginia when the Court
held the ban violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. 41 Although this was a step towards equality and inclusion in
jury selection, the legal advancements were rarely enforced and had
little influence on the behavior of local officials.42 For instance, in
some states the \"names of black residents were included on the lists
from which jury panels or \'venires\' were drawn, but were printed on a
different color paper so they could easily be avoided during the
supposedly random drawing of the venire.\"43 Such policies applied vague
requirements for jury selection to exclude Black people from the jury.\"
Today, racism still permeates all areas within the American legal system
and results in gross injustice towards people of color. For example,
[[Black Americans]{.mark}, in comparison to White Americans,
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} arrested at a higher rate,45 are
[[convicted]{.mark} of crimes [at a higher]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[rate]{.underline}]{.mark},46 [[and have longer sentences]{.mark}
imposed against them.]{.underline}4 7 Bail serves as a higher impediment
to the release of Black Americans, as do barriers to probation. 48 For
instance, Black Americans and Latinos are more likely than White
Americans to have their bail denied and their bond set at a higher
amount, which results in being detained longer because they cannot pay
heir higher bonds.49 Further, Black probationers are more likely to be
revoked than White probationers for similar behavior. 50 B. Racism in
Modern Jury Selection [Devastating [Jim Crow]{.mark} laws have [had a
**lasting impact**]{.mark} on jury selection]{.underline}. [Systemic
discrimination produces a convergence of realities that result in
significantly lower representation of Black Americans on juries than
their proportion of the citizenry]{.underline}. 51 Jury lists drawn from
[[voter registration]{.mark} records mean Black people are
underrepresented]{.underline} in the jury pool.5 2 Even when included on
the lists, [Black]{.underline} [people are more likely to be
disqualified by a [felony conviction]{.mark} or to qualify for a
[hardship exemption]{.mark} due to disproportionate rates of conviction
and poverty]{.underline}. 3 Moreover, \"\[o\]ver a century later,
[[state-sanctioned racial discrimination]{.mark} in jury selection
[remains **ubiquitous**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [the racial
composition of juries continues to shape substantive trial
outcomes]{.underline}.\"5 As mentioned above, [jury selection
perpetuates structural racism]{.underline} in the legal system [and
creates unjust outcomes for people of color]{.underline} in both
criminal and civil contexts. [This occurs both through the exclusion of
people of color from juries and inclusion of people with racial biases
that may influence their performance]{.underline}.\" Several independent
regional investigations indicate that [[juror exclusion]{.mark} on the
basis of race is [still]{.mark} [occur]{.mark}ring]{.underline}. 56 [In
criminal cases, [prosecutors]{.mark} [remove a **disproportionate**
number of Black]{.mark} individuals from [jury pools]{.mark}, and
[Black]{.mark} criminal [defendants continue to be tried by
**all**]{.mark}]{.underline} or largely **[[White
juries]{.underline}]{.mark}**.57 This exclusion continues despite
findings that juries with diverse membership spend more time in
deliberations, discuss more case facts, and end up making fewer errors
than juries composed solely of White participants.58 Moreover, this
issue persists even with the existing Batson challenge that supposedly
prevents attorneys from eliminating prospective jurors based on race.
While all jurisdictions give attorneys some number of peremptory
challenges, eliminating a juror solely because of the juror\'s race is
prohibited.\"9 The seminal case Batson v. Kentucky, in which a Black
defendant was found guilty of burglary after the prosecution used their
peremptory challenges to remove all four Black jurors, requires the
opposing attorney to have the opportunity to protest a peremptory
challenge that appears to be based only on race. 60 To withstand such a
protest, the attorney challenging the Black juror (or juror of any other
race) must provide a non-race-based reason for the challenge. 61 In most
instances, an attorney will be able to do so, and most judges will not
prohibit the attorney from exercising the challenge. 62 Notably, \"an
attorney may exercise peremptory challenges based on a juror\'s
occupation, age, or level of education.\" 63 For example, in one case
involving claims of race discrimination and retaliation, a trial judge
found that the defendant\'s assertion of striking one Black potential
juror because they were a union member was pretextual. 64 On the other
hand, striking another Black potential juror because they worked for the
same employer as the plaintiff and attended church with a potential
witness in the case was permissible. 65 [The process]{.underline},
therefore, [permits race to influence the jury selection process so long
as some other nonracial reason is provided for the
challenge]{.underline}. 66 Although in criminal proceedings a prosecutor
cannot systematically challenge and strike all Black jurors, [the
existing system prevents a Black criminal defendant from receiving a
diverse jury of their peers, which is arguably required in criminal
cases where the Sixth Amendment guarantees an impartial
jury]{.underline}. 67 [The American Bar Association]{.underline} has
recently [recognized]{.underline} the challenge of confronting racial
bias on the bench, including \"[the unfair exclusion of potential jurors
based on race or ethnicity]{.underline}.\" 68 The nuances of [systemic
racism]{.underline} embedded within the legal process [contribute to
power advantages for well-financed legal teams in regard to jury
composition]{.underline}. 69 [These power advantages are then used by
some legal teams to arrive at unjust outcomes for
racialized]{.underline}70 [people]{.underline} and have become so
widespread that at least one state, California, has initiated
investigations into how bias within the process of jury selection can be
addressed. 71 Another state, Washington, reformed the peremptory strike
process via court rule in 2018 to address implicit bias.72 II. THE
MECHANICS OF JURY SELECTION

#### Implicit bias means juries are inevitably racist

I. IMPLICATIONS OF IMPLICIT BIAS RESEARCH [[Jury verdicts]{.mark}
[involving Black parties]{.mark} [are]{.mark} already
**[tainted]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 25 [Social sci- ence research
indicates]{.underline} that [individuals have]{.underline}
[unconscious]{.underline} mental processes that lead to [implicit
biases]{.underline} toward others. 26 Further [studies]{.underline} have
examined implicit bias within the legal sphere, [find]{.underline}ing
that such [biases]{.underline} [impact the justice
system]{.underline}.27 The research thus indicates that [[it may be
**impossible** to keep implicit racial bias]{.mark} [out]{.mark}side of
jury deliberations]{.underline}. If that is the case, [[then]{.mark}
[jury verdicts]{.mark} regarding Black parties [are]{.mark} likely
**unreliable** because they are **[inherently
unfair]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 28 There is much literature on implicit
bias and its implications, but the broad consensus is that [[implicit
bias is **pervasive** and **unfavorable**]{.mark} [to African
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. 29 Implicit or unconscious bias stems
from cognitive processes over which individuals exercise no intentional
control. 30 These processes include the formation of perceptions,
impressions, and judgments, which in turn impact how individuals
behave.31 These unconscious processes lead to development of implicit
attitudes---how individuals tend to evaluate the world around them---and
implicit stereotypes---individual mental associa- tions between a group
and a trait. 32 Taken together, implicit attitudes and stereotypes
generate discriminatory implicit biases, which have the capac- ity to
generate behavior at odds with an individual's consciously endorsed
beliefs.33 Implicit bias can cut both ways, leading an individual to be
biased in favor of members of her own social group or against members of
a social group to which she does not belong.34 Implicit bias impacts how
individuals perceive and react to the world in all areas, including the
courtroom.35 Research indicates that [[implicit bias]{.mark} makes its
way into jury deliberations and accurately [predicts]{.mark} the [as-
sociations]{.mark} jurors make [between]{.mark} a defendant's [guilt
and]{.mark} her [race]{.mark}]{.underline}. 36 Specifi- cally, [jurors
are more likely to associate guilt with a Black defendant than a White
defendant]{.underline}.37 In one study, jury-eligible graduate and
undergraduate students were asked to complete two tests requiring them
to associate "guilty" or "not guilty" and "pleasant" and "unpleasant"
with various faces. 38 The [students' choices revealed a higher
correlation between "Black" and "guilty" as well as "Black" and
unpleasant words, than "White" and "guilty" or "White" and unpleasant
words]{.underline}. 39 Interestingly, the results also showed that
[participants who reported feeling more warmly toward Black people were
more likely to associate them with guilt]{.underline},40 [dem-
onstrating that implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes may not always
align]{.underline}.41 Another part of the study involved researchers
priming participants with images of dark or light skinned perpetrators,
then asking them to evaluate crime scene photographs.42 The
[participants were then shown pieces of evidence and asked to determine
how much each article tended to inculpate or exculpate the
defendant]{.underline}.43 The study concluded that [the stronger the
association between "Black" and "guilty" as well "Black" and
"unpleasant," the more likely a participant was to find ambiguous
evidence was inculpating]{.underline}. 44 In other words, [implicit bias
might make it more likely that [when presented with ambiguous
evidence]{.mark}, [a juror]{.mark} [may be **more likely** to]{.mark}
[find]{.mark} [it]{.mark} [probative of guilt with a Black
defendant]{.mark} than a White defendant]{.underline}.45 Judges may also
exhibit implicit bias in their decision-making.46 One study tested the
responses of judges after asking them to make choices in hypothetical
courtrooms where they were subliminally primed to identify the defendant
as racially ambiguous, or were explicitly told the defendant was White
or Black.47 The study revealed that the judge participants were more
likely to group White faces with positive words and Black faces with
negative words, and that this racial bias was more likely to be
exhibited in cases where the race was ambiguous rather than explicit. 48
This study thus indicates that judges may be better able to avoid racial
bias when they are expressly aware of the party's race than when they
are not.49 Thus [implicit bias pervades the courtroom, and [Black
defendants may]{.mark} [not have any safe- guards against racial
bias]{.mark}]{.underline}. 50 More generally, research also shows that
when it comes to punish- ment, [[individuals]{.mark} may be more
inclined to [associate Black defendants with culpability and
retribution]{.mark} than White defendants]{.underline}.51 One study
measured how much [[participants associated]{.mark} Black and [White
people with]{.mark} various words associated with retribution and
[leniency]{.mark}]{.underline}.52 [The results indicated a greater
association between Black faces and words indicating retribution and
White faces with words indicating leniency than other possible
combinations]{.underline}.53 Taken together, [pervasive implicit bias
creates a situation in which [jurors are more likely to **devalue** the
life of a Black]{.mark} [defendant]{.mark}, find her guilty, or
otherwise treat a Black party more unfavorably than a White
party]{.underline} in a case.54 Indeed, [implicit bias becomes
**systemic** when [racial bias becomes]{.mark} "unwittingly infused
with, and even cognitively [**inseparable** from]{.mark}, supposedly
race-neutral [legal theories]{.mark}]{.underline}. . .and
jurisprudential approach\[es\] to well-considered constitutional
doctrines." 55 Given how pervasive im- plicit bias is due to the
unconscious processes that generate it, [it seems **unlikely** that the
individuals in the jury box can be **immune**]{.underline} from it, nor
can the judges conducting voir dire necessarily be an adequate
safeguard. 56 Even if an individual is aware of her own implicit biases,
[the misalignment between expressly held views and implicitly held views
indicates that she may not be able to reason her way out of experiencing
their effect]{.underline}. 57 [It is therefore unlikely we can rid jury
verdicts of the pervasive effects of racial]{.underline}
[bias]{.underline}. I now turn to ways in which we may mitigate this
reality. II. CURRENT STATE OF COMMON AND STATUTORY LAW

#### Modern juries are as biased as the days of Jim Crow -- it's almost impossible to prove juror discrimination

**Frampton 18** \[Thomas W. Frampton, Climenko Fellow and Lecturer on
Law at Harvard Law School, 2018, "The Jim Crow Jury," Vanderbilt Law
Review,

III\. THE FUTURE OF THE JIM CROW JURY The Fourteenth Amendment\'s
guarantee of \"[equal protection of the laws]{.underline},\" the Supreme
Court explained in Batson, **[guarantees]{.underline}** [a defendant the
right \"to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to
nondiscriminatory criteria]{.underline}.\" 209 Time and again, the Court
has affirmed that [\"permitting racial prejudice in the jury system
damages \'both the fact and the perception\' of the jury]{.underline}\'s
role as \'a vital check against the wrongful exercise of power by the
State.\' \"210 But the data presented here show that, far from being
\"at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a
representative government,\" 2 1 1 [[racial prejudice]{.mark} has
[**always** infected]{.mark} [America\'s]{.mark} criminal [jury
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this Part, I want to situate our current
legal framework\'s permissive approach toward racial bias in the jury
system within the much broader arc of U.S. jury-discrimination law.
Despite recent pronouncements to the contrary, our \"maturing legal
system\" simply is not \"understand\[ing\] and . .. implement\[ing\] the
lessons of history.\"212 To the contrary, the Court\'s two most recent
encounters with racial prejudice and the jury (Foster v. Chatman213 and
Pefia-Rodriguez v. Colorado2 14) fit comfortably within the Court\'s
long tradition of halting gestures toward countering racial bias,
despite delivering legal victories to the individual nonwhite defendants
seeking relief. But if [the [past]{.mark} century\'s [efforts]{.mark}
have [failed to abolish the Jim Crow jury]{.mark}]{.underline}, where do
we% go next? In one sense, the project seems daunting: so long as
racism, permeates American life, the long view teaches, it will be
impossible to extirpate it from our flawed and imperfect jury system.
And yet, the history and data presented in Parts I and II suggest the
necessity of reforms-including an abolition of nonunanimous verdicts and
perhaps the adoption of affirmative race-conscious measures to ensure
the racial representativeness of juries-that could erode the Jim Crow
jury\'s enduring hold on the operation of American criminal justice.
While legal frameworks have changed radically since the 1890s, what is
most striking about the editorials in the Daily Crusaderis not how
distant the past appears, but rather how incisively nineteenth- century
activists identified doctrinal shortcomings that still plague our
jury-discrimination law. Consider, for example, two of the most
frequently advanced critiques of Batson and its progeny. First, [under
existing law, a prosecutor\'s race-neutral justification for striking a
juror may be \"silly or superstitious\"; the Court does not even require
\"a reason that makes sense,\" provided the reason is
race-neutral]{.underline}. 215 Predictably, [only the \"unapologetically
bigoted or painfully unimaginative\" seem to be ensnared in Batson\'s
net]{.underline}.2 16 Second, [[by shunning a]{.mark}
\"**[statistic]{.mark}ally** based [approach]{.mark} to exclusionary
peremptory]{.underline} [challenges\" [in favor of]{.mark} \"scrutiny of
[**individual** actions]{.mark}]{.underline},\" [the Court has rendered
itself ill equipped \"to confront]{.underline} the pervasive effects of
[racism]{.underline} in any meaningful way.\" 2 1 7 Racial justice
activists waging the initial fight against \"the Jim Crow jury\"
advanced both of these same critiques 120 years ago. Then, as now, legal
claims alleging jury discrimination occasionally prevailed, but only
when \"unapologetically bigoted or painfully unimaginative\" officials
effectively conceded the issue. 2 18 Then, as now, [[courts demonstrated
**indifference** to]{.mark} widespread
**[patterns]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of racial exclusion]{.mark},
[crediting]{.mark} instead the [perfunctory race-neutral]{.mark}
[justifications]{.mark} offered by state jury commissioners and
judges]{.underline}. On this view, Batson is not \"failing\"; it is
succeeding at doing what U.S. law has consistently done for the past
century.219 Indeed, in certain ways, [[we are less clear-eyed in
countering]{.mark} [racial]{.mark} bias in the [jury]{.mark} system
[today]{.mark} [than]{.mark} we were at the dawn of the [Jim
Crow]{.mark} jury]{.underline}. Although it is almost entirely forgotten
now- overlooked even by scholars of jury discrimination 220-it remains a
federal misdemeanor (punishable by a \$5,000 fine) for \"an officer or
other person charged with any duty in the selection . .. of jurors
\[to\] exclude\[ \]\" a potential juror \"on account of race, color, or
previous condition of servitude.\" 221 The offense first became law with
the Civil Rights Act of 1875.222 Four years later, at least nine
Virginia judges were indicted under the statute for excluding black
jurors from their courtrooms. 2 2 3 On the same day that the Court
decided Strauder (invalidating West Virginia\'s jury-discrimination law
under the Fourteenth Amendment), it rejected a habeas petition filed by
one of these Virginia judges in Ex Parte Virginia.224 But since then
there have been no reported criminal prosecutions under Section 4 of the
Act. As the data reported in Part II illustrates, however, there is
almost certainly a crime wave occurring throughout America\'s courtrooms
today (though federal authorities are loathe to treat it as such). 225
Another way in which [our [jury-discrimination law]{.mark} [seems
to]{.mark} have]{.underline} **[[regressed]{.underline}]{.mark}** is in
how the courts understand the role of race within jury deliberations. In
Strauder, the Court had little trouble recognizing that the reliability
of a jury\'s verdict was necessarily suspect when black jurors were
systematically excluded. Such \"jury packing\" was harmful because
\"\[i\]t is well known that prejudices often exist against particular
classes in the community, which sway the judgment of jurors, and which,
therefore, operate in some cases to deny to persons of those classes the
full enjoyment of that protection which others enjoy.\"22 6 But the
majority view in **[Batson]{.underline}** and its progeny has
[insisted]{.underline} that [race]{.underline} [and]{.underline} gender
are not just [normatively improper categories upon which to base juror
selection, but also are \"flatly irrational predictors of juror
perspective]{.underline}.\" 2 2 7 While initially proceeding from the
more modest position that an individual\'s race is \"unrelated to his
fitness as a juror,\"2 2 8 the Court has gone on to reason that
[race-conscious [peremptory challenges must reflect]{.mark} [an
attorney\'s \"open hostility\" toward]{.mark}]{.underline} or irrational
\"hidden and unarticulated fear\" of [[the juror\'s]{.mark}
[race]{.mark}]{.underline}. 229 Accordingly, the Court refused to give
Batson retroactive effect, because there was no good reason to think
\"the new rule ha\[d\] such a fundamental impact on the integrity of
factfinding as to compel retroactive application.\" 2 3 0 And when
extending Batson to include gender-based peremptory challenges, the
Court rejected the \"quasi- empirical claim\" that gender might predict
jurors\' views toward the relevant issues, crediting instead \"the
majority of studies \[that\] suggest gender plays no identifiable role
in jurors\' attitudes.\"23 1 (Ironically Batson\'s critics on the Court
have \"openly embrace\[d\] the idea .. . that attorneys may rationally
infer that members of discrete groups bring unique perspectives to the
jury.\" 2 32 ) Recognizing that racial composition of juries matters
when it comes to jury deliberations and trial outcomes does not
guarantee stronger anti-discrimination protections-the Court\'s
immediate post- Strauder jurisprudence illustrates as much-but such
candor is a necessary first step. First, as several scholars have noted,
acknowledging that \"[jury demographics matter]{.underline}\" and that
\"different \[more diverse\] juries will reach different results on the
same evidence\" militates in favor of a more robust Sixth Amendment fair
cross-section jurisprudence. 2 3 3 [Present [enforcement of this **Sixth
Amendment**]{.mark} guarantee [is \"**anemic**]{.mark}\" at
best]{.underline}, 2 3 4 but if verdicts are, \"at least in part,
socially rather than scientifically determined\" and \"experientially
constructed judgments rather than findings of immutable historical
fact,\" 2 3 5 [the harm of unrepresentative juries-even those composed
of otherwise \"impartial\" jurors-is necessarily acute]{.underline}. 236
Second, , this insight also provides the empirical grounding for some of
the more ambitious race-conscious proposals to counter today\'s Jim Crow
jury; if race has nothing to do with the behavior of real-world jurors
or.trial outcomes, it is hard to imagine the Court recognizing a
\"compelling interest\" advanced by any race-conscious reform. 237 To be
clear, many of these proposals (discussed below) will face an uphill
fight regardless, but demonstrating the real-world impact of
unrepresentative juries on defendants is a prerequisite for establishing
the legitimacy and viability of any such reform measures. 238 Whatever
strategies to counter the Jim Crow jury one embraces, they must
represent bolder changes than those announced by the Court in recent
years. In Foster v. Chatman, the Court reviewed a Georgia court\'s
denial of habeas relief to Timothy Foster, a black man sentenced to
death three decades earlier by an all-white jury.239 Foster alleged that
race discrimination tainted the selection of his petit jury, and by a
6-2 vote, the Court agreed that prosecutors were motivated in
substantial part by race when removing two black potential jurors. 240
But the Court\'s opinion did little to solve Batson\'s inadequacy, as it
turned in significant part on the uncommonly compelling evidence
supporting Foster\'s habeas petition. Through a series of Georgia Open
Records Act requests, Foster had obtained prosecutors\' notes from the
jury selection process. 24 1 These documents, which revealed
prosecutors\' color-coded system for flagging black jurors, were \"as
close to a \'smoking gun\' as one is likely to find in a Batson
challenge.\" 242 In reversing the judgment of the state habeas court,
the Court \"reassure\[d\] the public that a blatant violation of Batson
will not be ignored,\" but did nothing to expand, clarify, or tweak the
much-criticized Batson framework. 24 3 Peiha-Rodriguez v. Colorado broke
new ground by recognizing a defendant\'s constitutional right to adduce
evidence that racial animus tainted jury deliberations in his or her
case. 2 4 4 But at first blush, the opinion also appears crafted to aid
only the narrowest class of defendants. 245 Relying on the Sixth
Amendment\'s \"impartial jury\" guarantee, the Court held by a 5-3 vote
that Colorado\'s no-impeachment rule, which ordinarily prohibits jurors
from impeaching their previous verdicts, must yield where there is
compelling evidence that racial animus was a motivating factor in one or
more jurors\' deliberations. 2 46 In refreshingly frank terms, the Court
acknowledged that racial bias in the jury system is \"a familiar and
recurring evil\" that \"implicates unique historical, constitutional,
and institutional concerns.\" 247 But perhaps because of the
pervasiveness of such evil, 2 4 8 the Court quickly cabined its holding,
requiring proof of \"clear statement\[s\] that indicate\[\] . . . racial
stereotypes or animus,\"249 \"the most grave and serious statements of
racial bias,\"250 or evidence of \"blatant racial prejudice.\" 25 1 In
other words, [[the Court erected]{.mark} precisely [the]{.mark} sort of
**[high evidentiary]{.mark}** [standard]{.mark} [that]{.mark}, as a
practical matter, is required to prevail on a Batson claim, and that
[has been required of nonwhite defendants challenging]{.mark}
[racial]{.mark} bias in the [jury]{.mark} system [since]{.mark} the
earliest days of the [Jim Crow]{.mark} jury]{.underline}. Only in this
sense can the Peia-Rodriguezopinion be characterized as the work of \"a
maturing legal system \... understand\[ing\] and . .. implement\[ing\]
the lessons of history.\" 252 That said, Pefia-Rodriguez\'s
acknowledgement that [racial bias in the jury system implicates unique
constitutional concerns]{.underline} may bolster more ambitious efforts
to confront the Jim Crow jury. Consider the Court\'s discussion of why
Colorado\'s no-impeachment rule, despite its long and venerable
pedigree, must contain a Sixth Amendment exception for evidence of
racial bias in particular: All forms of improper bias pose challenges to
the trial process. But there is a sound basis to treat racial bias with
added precaution. [A constitutional rule that]{.underline} [racial bias
in the justice system must be addressed]{.underline}-including, in some
instances, after the verdict has been entered-[is necessary to prevent
systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a
central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right]{.underline}. 253
Such \"disparate treatment\" for racial bias claims, the dissent
correctly noted, is almost unheard of in the Sixth Amendment context.
254 Peha- Rodriguez certainly expands upon the Court\'s recent Sixth
Amendment jurisprudence (including recent cases rejecting a Sixth
Amendment exception to the no-impeachment rule for evidence of nonracial
juror bias) 2 5 5 and \"suggest\[s\] that the Sixth Amendment recognizes
some sort of hierarchy of partiality or bias.\" 256 At minimum, the
Court appears to have recognized that the Sixth Amendment\'s guarantees
give rise to a compelling interest in countering the perception of a
jury system tainted by racial bias. So what would a more robust effort
to confront the Jim Crow jury look like? In the 1990s, there was a
flurry of academic interest in (and some actual experiments with)
countering racial underrepresentation in the criminal jury system.257
The more ambitious proposals to improve the racial representativeness of
criminal juries included the use of racial quotas, 2 5 8 \"affirmative
selection\" measures, 259 and \"jural districting\" regimes (akin to
electoral districts that group \"communities of interest\"). 260 But
given the overall trend in the Court\'s equal protection
jurisprudence-that is, its application of strict scrutiny to all
state-initiated racial classifications, \"benign\" or otherwise-many
worried that these measures may be constitutionally infirm. 261 These
concerns are certainly no less germane two decades later, but given the
deep, historical roots of racial bias and the American jury system (and
the growing evidence of how racial composition of the jury still shapes
determinations of guilt and innocence), such dramatic experiments remain
essential. Importantly, explicit race-conscious efforts to build more
representative jury panels are not wholly foreign to American criminal
justice. As Professor Jack Chin and Kendra Clark have highlighted, 262
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (\"UCMJ\") allows the convening
authority, when assembling the jury panel for a court-martial, to take
race and gender into account \"when seeking in good faith to make the
panel more representative of the accused\'s race or gender.\" 2 6 3
Article 25 of the UCMJ also authorizes jury quotas, of a sort: \"Any
enlisted member \[may insist that he\] not be tried by a general or
special court-martial the membership of which does riot include enlisted
members in a number comprising at least one-third of the total
membership of the court . .\"264 Perhaps analogous innovations should be
imported into civilian courts. 265 If maximizing the appearance of
racial fairness in criminal jury proceedings is a compelling government
interest (as suggested in Peha-Rodriguez), and the demographic
composition of the jury has been inextricably tied to racial fairness
for the past 120 years (as suggested in Parts I and II), similar
measures in civilian courts could pass constitutional muster as
\"reasonably necessary\" to promote at least the perception of fairness
in contemporary criminal adjudication. 266 Recognizing the continuity
between the Jim Crow jury of the 1890s and the Jim Crow jury of today
brings one final point into focus. In 1972, in a pair of fractured 4-1-4
opinions, the Court held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments do not
mandate unanimity in state jury trials. 267 While the cases (Apodaca v.
Oregon and Johnson u. Louisiana) were not primarily briefed or argued on
Equal Protection groundS268-instead turning on the interaction of the
Sixth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment\'s Due Process Clause-the
Johnson dissenters recognized that nonunanimity might exacerbate racial
bias in the jury system: The guarantee against systematic discrimination
in the selection of criminal court juries is a fundamental of the
Fourteenth Amendment. That has been the insistent message of this Court
in a line of decisions \[involving race discrimination\] extending over
nearly a century. The clear purpose of these decisions has been to
ensure universal participation of the citizenry in the administration of
criminal justice. Yet today\'s judgment approves the elimination of the
one rule that can ensure that such participation will be meaningful-the
rule requiring the assent of all jurors before a verdict of conviction
or acquittal can be returned. Under today\'s judgment, nine jurors can
simply ignore the views of their fellow panel members of a different
race or class. 2 6 9 Citing Strauder, the dissenters continued that only
unanimity \"can serve to minimize the potential bigotry of those who
might convict on inadequate evidence, or acquit when evidence of guilt
was clear.\" 270 And, importantly, \"community confidence\" in the jury
system was threatened when \"a defendant who is conspicuously identified
with a particular group can be acquitted or convicted by a jury split
along group lines.\" 27 1 The plurality opinion downplayed these
concerns (\"\[minority groups\] will be present during all
deliberations, and their views will be heard\") 272 , but the history
and statistics provided in Part II vindicate the dissenters\' critique.
Even if nonunanimous criminal juries remain permissible under the Sixth
and Fourteenth Amendments-and there is a strong argument against this,
given the Court\'s subsequent incorporation doctrine jurisprudence 27
3-they can no longer withstand Equal Protection scrutiny. The closest
parallel in this regard is Hunter v. Underwood, in which the Court in
1985 unanimously invalidated a provision of the Alabama Constitution
disenfranchising felons and those convicted of misdemeanor \"crime\[s\]
. . . involving moral turpitude.\"2 74 The Alabama measure was enacted
during Alabama\'s Constitutional Convention of 1901, three years after
Louisiana\'s nonunanimous jury provision was approved. As the Court
noted in Hunter, the gathering \"was part of a movement that swept the
post- Reconstruction South to disenfranchise blacks.\" 2 75 The Court
allowed that additional motivations probably influenced the adoption of
Alabama\'s challenged suffrage measure-many convention delegates were
eager to strip the franchise from poor white Alabamans, too-but
nevertheless recognized that \"discrimination against blacks . . . was a
motivating factor for the provision.\" 276 In reaching this conclusion,
the Court was unbothered by the argument that \"there was little or no
debate at the Constitutional Convention of 1901 concerning this
\[disenfranchisement\] section and little or no evidence concerning its
passage.\" 27 7 Applying the Equal Protection framework established in
Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development
Corp.,278 the Court held that the provision violated the Fourteenth
Amendment: \"\[I\]ts original enactment was motivated by a desire to
discriminate against blacks on account of race and the section continues
to this day to have that effect.\" 2 7 9 (The present-day disparate
impact on black Alabamans had been conceded. 280) The parallels are
striking. As with Alabama\'s disenfranchisement provision, Louisiana\'s
nonunanimous jury provision was first adopted at a convention where
\"zeal for white supremacy ran rampant.\" 28 1 As in Hunter, the
official record from the convention is sparse, as other concerns
dominated the debate. But, in such circumstances, the Court has
instructed that \"\[t\]he historical background of the decision . . .
particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for
invidious purposes\" and \"\[t\]he specific sequence of events leading
up to the challenged decision\" are \"subjects of proper inquiry in
determining whether racially discriminatory intent existed.\" 282 The
story of the fight against the Jim Crow jury fills that gap. 2 83 The
\"historical background of the decision,\" coupled with \"\[t\]he
specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,\"
make clear that racial bias motivated Louisiana\'s decision to abandon
unanimity. Disparate impact is also now established: whether viewed from
the perspective of the juror or the defendant, 284 nonunanimity
continues to have a racially disparate impact today. Such overt vestiges
of Jim Crow should be struck down. CONCLUSION Or Louisiana voters may
act on their own. In May 2018, the Louisiana legislature endorsed a
constitutional amendment-subject to voter approval-that would abolish
nonunanimous verdicts for offenses committed on or after January 1,
2019.285 The proposal will be on the November 2018 ballot. 28 6 Although
the vast majority of Louisiana\'s sixty-four district attorneys opposed
the proposal, the politically powerful Louisiana District Attorneys
Association remained neutral; the organization does not take a public
stance on important matters unless its membership is unanimous. 287
Although initially \"seen as a long shot,\" 288 the unexpected passage
of the proposal emerged from years of agitation and organizing by
activists, scholars, legal workers, defendants, and the formerly
incarcerated. Notably, momentum for the bill grew amidst a political
climate-in both Louisiana and across the United States-in which the
operation of U.S. criminal law has once again become a focus for racial
justice advocates. In 2016, Louisiana witnessed its largest mass
protests in decades following the police killing of black Baton Rouge
resident Alton Sterling; 289 in 2017, pushed by a broad coalition
including racial justice groups, the state passed a series of criminal-
justice reforms that have dislodged Louisiana from its perennial status
as the United States\' (and the world\'s) \"prison capital.\" 290
Unsurprisingly, race played a salient role in the legislative debate
surrounding the constitutional amendment, too: a pivotal moment came
when a prominent white opponent of the measure, to the outrage of
supporters, blithely conceded that nonunanimity was a \"vestige( \] of
slavery\.... \[I\]t is what it is.\"291 The proposal eventually garnered
bipartisan backing, but it would have fallen short of the two-thirds
vote needed to advance to the November ballot if not for the unanimous
support of the state\'s Legislative Black Caucus.2 92 This Article has
sought to provide historical context for this moment, not only for the
existence of nonunanimous verdicts in Louisiana, but also for the
manifold ways in which race enters into our jury system and the efforts
taken outside of the courtroom to reform the institution. Activists
today, like those a century before them, are emphasizing that the
criminal law plays a central role in perpetuating and deepening racial
subordination. And [[the jury box]{.underline}]{.mark}, just
[as]{.underline} it was [in the late nineteenth century, has become a
site of social contestation]{.underline}.\' Whether Louisiana voters
approve or reject the constitutional amendment, it would be a mistake to
view the measure simply as a referendum on an unusual quirk of one
state\'s criminal procedure. Rather, [it [represents]{.mark} the
resumption of a [political]{.mark} [struggle]{.mark} that would
be]{.underline} altogether [[legible to]{.underline}]{.mark} Louis
[Martinet]{.underline}, Homer **[[Plessy]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and]{.underline} the [other activists]{.underline} of the Comit6 des
Citoyens [a century ago]{.underline}. In April 2017, New Orleans
contractors wearing face masks and bulletproof vests removed a massive
stone obelisk celebrating the White League\'s violent 1874 insurrection
against Louisiana\'s Reconstruction government. 293 In the following
weeks, three other Confederate monuments came down, as well, leaving
behind empty pedestals at prominent locations throughout the city.2 9 4
The monuments\' removal was not just the work of enlightened municipal
officials, 295 but rather the culmination of decades of activism, 2 9 6
and represents a demonstration of grassroots \"collective will to
address entrenched systemic oppression.\" 297 But other, less [tangible
relics from the same era remain]{.underline}.

#### Trials allow jury nullification, allowing the KKK to commit hate crimes without punishment

**Jackson 11** \[Reggie Jackson, journalist and graduate of Concordia
University, 2-13-2021, \"Jury Nullification: More violent insurrections
are expected if Trump is acquitted for his acts of sedition\", Milwaukee
Independent,

As people around the country go on with their daily lives an injustice
with no precedent will happen soon on Capitol Hill. A sitting president
who incited a mob which attacked the U.S. Congress will get a free pass
for his seditious acts. There is a principal in law called **[jury
nullification]{.underline}**. It is widely condemned by attorneys but
has been in play for most of the past century and a half.
[[Juries]{.mark} have time and time again **[nullified]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark} [evidence of someone's]{.mark} [guilt]{.mark}y or innocence
[and freed people]{.mark} [who should have been convicted]{.mark} and
conversely sent men and women to prison despite obvious evidence of
their innocence]{.underline}. A classic example of this principle
[play]{.underline}ing [out]{.underline} [was the acquittal in
Mississippi of the men who kidnapped and murdered]{.underline}
14-year-old **[[Emmett Till]{.underline}]{.mark}** on August 28, 1955.
[Their [acquittal was a **foregone conclusion**]{.mark} the day were
charged. Everyone knew that [an all-white]{.mark}]{.underline}, all-male
[[jury]{.underline}]{.mark} of their peers (literally) [[would
**never**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in a **million years** [hold
them]{.mark} [accountable **regardless of the evidence**]{.mark}
presented to them. This was what many referred to as [Negro
Justice]{.mark}. The [principal was in play]{.mark} across the country
[when Blacks]{.mark} [were on trial]{.mark}, if they even made it that
far by escaping lynch mobs]{.underline}. Likewise, those handful of
[[Whites]{.mark} [who]{.mark} had [brutalized Blacks knew their "peers"
would **let them off the**]{.mark} **[hook]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
closing statements in the trial of Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam in a
Sumter, Mississippi court tells you everything you need to know. The
prosecutor wanted a conviction and the defense demanded an acquittal. We
all knew who had more sway in that segregated courtroom. "They murdered
that boy, and to hide their dastardly act, they tied barbed wire to his
neck and to a heavy gin fan and dumped him into the river for the
turtles and the fish." -- Gerald Chatham, Prosecutor "Your ancestors
will turn over in their grave, and I'm sure every last Anglo-Saxon one
of you has the courage to free these men." -- Sidney Carlton, Defense
Attorney According to Hugh Whitaker, [Sheriff-elect Dogan told jurors to
wait a while before coming out to make "it look good]{.underline}."
[They deliberated for 68 minutes and came back with a not guilty
verdict.]{.underline} [One juror]{.underline} later [said: "We wouldn't
have taken so long if we hadn't stopped to drink (soda)
pop]{.underline}." [The men walked free]{.underline} and a year later
were paid \$1,500 each to give an interview to Look Magazine, confessing
to exactly what they had done to Till. Double jeopardy protected them
from a second trial and the federal government was not in the habit yet
of filing civil rights charges against White murderers in the South at
that time. [[Jury nullification meant they **ignored the
testimony**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} was [not swayed]{.mark}
one bit [by the gruesome nature of the crime]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
are seeing the same thing play out in the highest level of the
government and no one can do anything to stop it. This government is
broken. [When men and women sworn to uphold the law, can time and time
again ignore the law, what value does it have]{.underline}. These are
the same people who ran on so-called law and order platforms when
elected to Congress. The hypocrisy is palatable. Some will be surprised
by Trump's acquittal. They must have their heads buried somewhere. It is
so obvious that we will be witness to a gross miscarriage of justice.
How do you willingly allow this to happen and sleep at night. I have
heard some refer to these Republican supplicants of Donald Trump as
evil. They are not. They are simply keeping a long tradition alive.
[Jury nullification is **alive and well**]{.underline}.

### Contention 8: Crime

#### Crime is low now

**Vera 6-20** \[Vera Institute of Justice, 6-20-2025, \"Crime Is Down in
2025. Trump Doesn't Deserve Credit.\",
https://www.vera.org/news/crime-is-down-in-2025-trump-doesnt-deserve-credit\]/Kankee

For the past year, Donald Trump has been saying that "homicides are
skyrocketing" and the country is "breaking down" with violence even as
the data told a much different story. Now, as crime keeps declining,
even Trump is finally changing his tune. [Data]{.underline} and analysis
from the FBI, Council on Criminal Justice, and Major Cities Chiefs
Association all [show]{.underline} that, [overall, [crime went
down]{.mark} **significantly** in]{.underline} [2024]{.underline}, [with
violent crime]{.underline} largely [returning [to **pre-pandemic**
levels]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [good news **defies
expectations**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[homicide]{.mark}
rates]{.underline} in Baltimore, Detroit, and St. Louis
[[declined]{.underline}]{.mark} even beyond pre-pandemic levels
[[to]{.mark} **historically low**]{.underline} [[2014
rates]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now, early data suggests that [the crime
drop is continuing under Trump's second term.]{.underline} It is still
too early in the year to talk with confidence about crime trends in
2025, but at least one [research]{.underline}er [projects that [2025 is
on track]{.mark} to follow [2024 in terms]{.mark} of **[continued
declines]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} homicides and [violent
crime]{.mark}.]{.underline} Until recently, the Trump administration
avoided talking about progress on safety, using the image of a country
under "invasion" and permeated with "lawlessness" to justify a brutal
mass detention and deportation agenda along with "law-and-order"
policies that will reduce police accountability, increase executions,
and lengthen prison sentences. But on June 5, President Trump spoke at a
roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police and said, "We\'ve removed
thousands of violent criminal, illegal aliens from our communities as
part of the largest deportation effort in American history. And just [[a
few months into office, the national murder rate has **plummeted** by
**28 percent**]{.underline}]{.mark}." Conservative media has pushed this
story as well. Just as the White House did with fentanyl seizures, which
also began declining before Trump took office, he is trying to claim
that the crime decline demonstrates his policies are working. As such,
it's crucial to set the record straight on Trump and crime. Why Trump
isn't to thank for the crime decline Despite Trump's claim that "the
previous administration allowed lawlessness to permeate our country,"
the crime decline long predated his second term. After three decades of
mostly continuous decline, crime spiked in 2020 amid the COVID-19
pandemic. But after a narrative of out-of-control crime firmly took
hold, especially during the 2022 midterms, crime rates began subsiding
rapidly in 2023. Looking at crime rates across the country and across
categories of crime, it is clear that [the decline in 2025 is a
continuation of a downward trend that began in 2023.]{.underline}
Trump's public safety policies do not reflect what we know about public
safety. His war on immigrants and funding terminations to evidence-based
violence-prevention strategies are both more likely to make the country
more dangerous than less. It is also far too early to see any changes
from many of the administration's actions related to crime---like its
executive order on policing or changes in federal prosecutions. Who
deserves credit for the crime decline

#### Plea bargaining reduces crimes -- increased guilty conviction rates and better info gathering

**Berg and Kim 18** \[Nathan Berg, researcher at the University of
Otago, and Jeong-Yoo Kim, researcher at the Department of Economics,
Kyung Hee University, 2018, Plea bargaining with multiple defendants and
its deterrence effect" International Review of Law and Economics
https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0144818818301108\]/Kankee

Economic rationales contribute in important ways to debates over plea
bargaining. Presumably, the first economic analysis of plea bargaining
is Landes (1971), arguing that plea bargaining can save time and other
variable costs associated with going to trial. In Landes's model, the
prosecutor's problem is specified as maximiza- tion of the number of
convictions subject to a budget constraint. Landes' analysis shows that
plea bargaining can improve efficiency, especially when trial
convictions are costly. Informational issues and strategic thinking
inherent in criminal cases are not addressed in Landes' analysis,
however. Grossman and Katz's (1983) pioneering work provides what is
likely the first game-theoretic model of plea bargaining, addressing one
important informational issue by providing conditions under which guilty
defendants reveal their types (guilty or innocent). Grossman and Katz
identify two [benefits of plea bargaining]{.underline}---an
[**insurance** effect and a **screening** effect]{.underline}. They
assert that [a risk- averse defendant and a [prosecutor]{.mark}
[prefer]{.mark} [the sure conviction]{.mark} of a guilty
defendant]{.underline} under plea bargaining [[over]{.mark} the risk of
[litigating]{.mark} in court]{.underline}. They also show that [[plea
bargaining serves]{.mark} as a **[screen]{.mark}ing** mechanism,
[which]{.mark} confers the potential advantage of [**improved**
**accuracy** of]{.mark} [sentencing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Grossman and
Katz characterize both a pooling equilibrium and a separating
equilibrium. In the pooling equilibrium, the prosecutor makes a plea
offer that is rationally accepted by both guilty and innocent
defendants. In a separat- ing equilibrium, however, [the prosecutor
makes [an offer]{.mark} [that is accepted by a guilty defendant
but]{.mark} [rejected by an innocent one]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, the
typical "adverse selection" (or "lemons" problem) occurs in which
[[defendants who accept plea offers have higher]{.mark} average
[culpability]{.mark} or are more likely to be guilty.]{.underline} Most
economic analyses of plea bargaining, however, focus on settings with
only one defendant despite there being numer- ous examples of real-world
criminal cases in which multiple co-defendants would appear to play an
important role in deter- mining sentencing outcomes. One such example is
the case of price fixing and related collusive activities among multiple
firms. Indeed, there are some exceptions such as Kobayashi (1992) and
Kim (2009) that consider the situation of multiple co-defendants who are
known to be connected with the same crime. However, nei- ther of those
papers addressed the dynamic effect of plea bargaining on crime
deterrence in a multiple-defendant setting.1 This lacuna in the extant
literature is rather surprising given that one of the main criticisms
against plea bargaining is that it weakens crime deter- rence by
offering defendants shorter sentences. Reinganum (1993) and Miceli
(1996) analyze the dynamical issue in a model with a single defendant,
examining how plea bargaining influences the incentive to commit crimes.
In this paper, we consider a dynamic model of plea bargaining between a
prosecutor and multiple co- defendants. In our model, defendants are not
ex ante known to be guilty. The guilt or innocence of defendants is
endogenously deter- mined as the result of their criminal decisions. To
investigate the effect of plea bargaining on the incentive to commit a
crime, we first consider a model in which the prosecutor is unsure about
whether the defendants are guilty or innocent. Because guilt is
uncertain from the prosecutor's view, a socially benevolent prosecutor
is assumed to pursue the objective of minimizing judicial errors, spec-
ified as a weighted sum of type-I and type-II errors (i.e., not simply
maximizing penalties as in some previous models). Then, based on the
analysis, we will examine the effect of plea bargaining on the incentive
to commit crimes. The objective that prosecutors in our model use---to
minimize a weighted sum of losses from the two types of judicial
errors---can be interpreted as consistent with guidelines codifying
appropriate prosecutorial behavior across a broad range of real-world
judicial systems. For example, prosecutors' duty in the US criminal
justice system is to "seek justice" rather than merely convictions.2
Sim- ilarly, Article 1 of Korea's Code for Prosecutors (as instructed by
the Korean Ministry of Justice) guides prosecutors to represent the
public interest to minimize judicial errors---as do other countries'
judicial codes---contrary to the widespread perception that prose-
cutors are incentivized solely to pursue the objective of maximizing
penalties. It is well known in the case of a single defendant that the
pros- ecutor offers the defendant's certainty equivalent (i.e., the
offer that gives the defendant the same disutility he expects by going
to trial). In the case of multiple defendants, however, calculating
multiple certainty equivalent offers is less straightforward because
they depend on whether the other defendant accepts his respec- tive
offer or not. Unlike models with a single defendant, our model with
multiple co-defendants allows the prosecutor to make plea offers
contingent on the defendant's promise to both plead guilty and testify
against the other co-defendant. Therefore, a certainty equivalent offer
to one defendant must be contingent on whether the other defendant
accepts his offer or not. We characterize all possible
separating-equilibrium offers that are accepted only by guilty
defendants and all pooling offers that are accepted by both guilty and
innocent defendants.3 In both types of equilibria, plea offers must be
fair in the sense that the more culpable defendant (i.e., the one who
deserves a longer sentence) receives a harsher penalty, unless both
defendants are equally culpable. Our model's result that any plea
bargaining equilibrium with multiple co-defendants must necessarily
respect at least this rather weak notion of fairness stands in sharp
contrast to Kobayashi's (1992) model in which unfair equilibria are
possible (i.e. in which the more culpable defendant may receive a less
severe penalty).4 These contrasting predictions regarding the fairness
of equilibrium plea bargaining in our model and Kobayashi's (1992) are
the result of different equilibrium concepts. Unfair equilibria are
impossible in our model as long as the spirit of Nash equilib- rium is
respected by implicitly requiring all agents' beliefs to be consistent
with their equilibrium strategies. In a separating equilibrium, the plea
bargain offers are asym- metric in that only the less culpable
defendants are offered a plea discount. In a pooling equilibrium, both
defendants are offered plea discounts. Intuitively, longer (i.e., more
severe) plea offers in the pooling equilibrium, as they approach the
duration for a guilty defendant without plea bargaining, increase the
loss from type- I errors when a defendant is actually innocent
(excessively harsh sentencing for the innocent defendants) and decrease
the loss from type-II errors (insufficiently harsh sentencing for the
guilty defen- dants). The optimal pooling equilibrium in our model is
determined by the plea offer that balances these two effects (i.e.,
equating the marginal benefit of reducing type-II error with the
marginal cost of increasing type-I error for each defendant). The
prosecutor's choice between the separating or pooling equilibrium
depends on the rel- ative importance of type-I and type-II errors. If
type-I errors are sufficiently more important in the prosecutor's
objective function then optimal plea offers are characterizable as those
that convey larger aggregate rewards offered to, and accepted by, both
types of defendants, which leads to the pooling equilibrium. In the
other direction, the separating equilibrium is selected whenever type-II
errors receive greater relative weight in the prosecutor's objective
function. The result that only one defendant receives a plea discount in
a separating equilibrium holds even when two codefendants are equally
culpable. If the prosecutor gives plea discounts to both defendants,
type-II errors become much higher than when he gives a plea discount to
only one defendant, making the other accept an undiscounted offer. The
former case (allowing discounts to both defendants) is equivalent to the
case that the prosecutor makes plea bargaining with only one defendant
twice. This shows an impor- tant difference between plea bargaining with
a single defendant and with multiple defendants. It is worthwhile
further comparing our result with that of Kobayashi (1992). Kobayashi
considers a complete-information game of plea bargaining with two
co-defendants. In his model, it is known that both defendants are
guilty. Therefore, the objec- tive of Kobayashi's prosecutor is to
maximize the sum of the two defendants' expected penalties (or,
equivalently, minimize the sum of expected discounts, i.e., the
aggregate reward, relative to the expected punishment without plea
bargaining). Kobayashi obtains the counterintuitive result that a more
culpable defendant may receive a more lenient penalty, which is
intuitively unfair. Such unfair outcomes occur in his model when, for
example, a more culpable Defendant 1 believes that the less culpable
Defendant 2 is very unlikely to accept the offer made to Defendant 2,
while Defendant 2 believes that Defendant 1 is highly likely to accept
his respective offer. In this case, because of the role of the other
defendant's exogenously given belief in the best-response func- tion,
Defendant 1 may rationally choose to be more likely to reject the offer
than Defendant 2. Thus, the prosecutor is forced to make a more
attractive offer to the more culpable Defendant 1 to induce him to
accept his respective offer, implying that the offer to Defendant 1
can---in theory---be lower than the offer to less culpable Defendant 2
in equilibrium. This unsettling possibility of the less culpable
defendant receiving a more severe punishment follows from Kobayashi's
assumption that each defendant's belief regarding the other's acceptance
decision is exogenously given. However, once we require that all
players' beliefs satisfy the con- dition of being consistent with
defendants' equilibrium strategies, then Kobayashi's unfair plea
bargains cannot occur in any equilib- rium in our model. Another
difference between Kobayashi's model and ours is the meaning of "more
culpable." We define a defendant as being more culpable if he deserves a
longer sentence than the other. In con- trast, Kobayashi defines a
defendant as more culpable if he has a higher probability of conviction
and his acceptance of the plea offer increases the probability of
conviction by more than acceptance of the plea offer by the other
defendant does. In our model, accep- tance of the plea offer by the more
culpable defendant does not necessarily imply a larger increase in the
probability that the other defendant is convicted. Both defendants'
conviction probabilities are increased equally no matter which
co-defendant accepts the plea offer. In other words, both defendants
have the same informa- tion regardless of which co-defendant is more
culpable. Because the more culpable defendant's sentence conditional on
going to court is expected to be greater, this more culpable defendant
ben- efits more from judicial errors. Consequently, the prosecutor must
offer larger plea-bargaining discounts to a more culpable defendant (who
is less willing to accept plea offers), in order to induce him to accept
it. Since larger discounts (i.e., reductions in sentencing) are costly
from the prosecutor's point of view, the prosecutor chooses to offer a
plea discount only to the less culpable defendant. Hence, equilibrium
offers must be fair. Despite the advantage of static efficiency achieved
by reduc- ing judicial errors through plea bargaining, there remain
important concerns about the possibility of dynamic inefficiency insofar
as reduced sentencing may increase the incentive to commit crimes. One
of the strongest criticisms against plea bargaining, which by many
accounts would appear to rest upon a theoretically obvi- ous mechanism,
avers that plea bargaining can lead to softer sentencing, thereby
weakening the deterrent effect of expected punishment and consequently
increasing crime rates. Although this mechanism may seem obvious (i.e.,
that potential criminals would, as defendants, face lower expected
sentences under plea bargain- ing and therefore have a greater
likelihood of committing a crime), the [plea bargaining]{.underline}
mechanism [does indeed have a crime-deterrent effect. In a separating
equilibrium, the benefit of [increased info]{.mark}rma- tion revealed by
the plea bargaining institution [more than **offsets**]{.mark} [the cost
of weakened deterrence]{.mark} (e.g., reductions in the mean duration of
sentences]{.underline}), which (in any separating equilibrium) we show
is degenerate at zero; thus, the [[plea bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}
institution, in our model's separating equilibrium, [leads]{.underline}
**[[unambiguously]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to [lower crime
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}. Intuitively, this is [because [plea
bargaining allows the prosecutor to collect incriminating evidence
against co-defendants based on their testimonies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In a pooling equilibrium as well, plea bargaining provides stronger
deterrence than without plea bar- gaining. A similar intuition can be
applied to a pooling equilibrium. [[The prosecutor can make]{.mark}
[harsher plea offers acceptable by]{.mark} using [info]{.mark}rmational
enhancement as a **[threat strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
deterrent effect of plea bargaining was analyzed earlier by Reinganum
(1993) and Miceli (1996) but only for a single defen- dant. Miceli's
model is similar to ours in that it focuses on a screening mechanism.
Miceli (1996) considers a two-stage game in which a legislature first
determines criminal punishments and then, once crimes have been
committed as a best response to the statutory punishments, actual
punishments are determined by prosecutors and judges in the subsequent
stage of the game with plea-bargaining or going to trial. Miceli shows
that if the legislature raises the magnitude of punishment too high,
then the deterrent effect may counterintuitively be weakened due to the
response of prosecutors who believe that severe statutory punishments do
not fit the crime. Reinganum (1993) considers a two-stage signal- ing
game based on Reinganum (1988). Our model extends Miceli's analysis to
the case of two co-defendants although our model has several important
differences. Our finding that [plea bargaining]{.underline} with
multiple co-defendants **[unambiguously]{.underline}** [deters
crime]{.underline} sheds new light on debates over the informational and
social efficiency of real-world leniency pro- grams. One of the
important policy questions in recent decades concerns how to revise
leniency programs that grant amnesty (e.g., to firms that previously
engaged in illegal antitrust activity) to promote improvements in social
efficiency. Because many illegal antitrust activities such as
price-fixing involve more than a sin- gle firm, our model of plea
bargaining with multiple co-defendants can provide novel insight
relevant to the design of optimal leniency programs. The article is
organized as follows. In Section 2, we specify the basic setup for our
model of plea bargaining with multiple co- defendants under incomplete
information. In Section 3, taking the plea offers as given, we analyze
the defendants' decisions about whether to accept pleas offers. In
Section 4, we characterize the separating equilibrium offers and pooling
equilibrium offers by the prosecutor. In Section 5, we discuss some
modifications of our plea bargaining model. In Section 6, we consider an
extension that brings in defendants' decisions about whether to commit a
crime by adding an earlier stage of the game before plea bargaining
begins. Section 7 contains concluding remarks and further caveats.

I. FBI Informants and Organized Crime **[[Without informants, we're
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. --- Clarence Kelley, FBI Director
(1973--1978)5 [The FBI]{.underline} is the primary general law
enforcement agency for the U.S. government. In its 2008 budgetary
request, the agency stated that it [maintains over fifteen thousand
"confidential human sources]{.underline}."6 The hall- mark of a typical
FBI confidential human source (CHS) or confidential informant (CI) is a
person identified and cultivated by a particular FBI "handler."
Approximately 20 percent of CHSs are "long-term," meaning that they have
been working for the FBI for five years or more. Some informants are
members of organizations, either criminal or legitimate; the job is to
provide the FBI with ongoing information about that entity and its other
members. Some [[informants]{.mark} take the opportunity to [exit a
criminal]{.mark} [organization by becoming a witness against
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Informants [are]{.mark} rewarded]{.underline}
in various standard ways, including [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} money,
**[[lenience]{.underline}]{.mark}** for past crimes, and the ability to
continue committing criminal offenses.7 [[The FBI uses]{.mark}
[informants in]{.mark} all sorts of cases, including [**gang** investi-
gations]{.mark}, [financial crimes, and]{.mark}
**espionage**]{.underline}. But many of [its highest-profile informant
successes have come in connection with its multidecade]{.underline}
efforts to break up La Cosa Nostra, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Italian
**[[mafia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mafia assassin Aladena Fratianno,
a.k.a. "Jimmy the Weasel," became an informant and spent the 1980s in
witness protection: he helped convict numerous mafia members.8 And in
2018, eighty-four- year- old Francis P. Salemme was convicted of the
1993 murder of a federal witness. Salemme, better known as "Cadillac
Frank" and the fearsome former head of the New England La Cosa Nostra
family, had himself been in witness protection for years until the
remains of the dead witness were discovered. Multiple mob informants
testified against him, including Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi himself,
who by this time was serving a life sentence for ten murders.
[The]{.underline} Salemme [prosecution was described as a **last
vestige** of the mafia's once-formidable power]{.underline}. As one
lawyer put it, "[[everybody's been **burned to a crisp** here by
informants]{.underline}]{.mark}."9 Other informant-driven successes
disclosed by the FBI include: a three-year grand jury investigation of
organized crime that led to six convictions; the investigation of three
violent gangs in a city in the Northeast that led to thirty-five cases
involving fifty-four gang members; and a two- year undercover operation
that led to the indictment of four Houston City Council members.10 But
the FBI's use of high-ranking criminal informants has generated both
costs and critics over the years. For example, Salvatore "Sammy the
Bull" Gravano was one of the FBI's most infamous, productive, and prob-
lematic informants. A mafia hit man who confessed to nineteen murders,
his 1992 testimony helped the FBI obtain nearly forty convictions, most
notably that of John Gotti. The government then relocated Gravano to
Arizona in the witness protection program. There he rejoined organized
crime and, in 2001, pled guilty to running a multimillion-dollar ecstasy
drug ring. In 2003, he was charged with ordering the killing of
Detective Peter Calabro, but charges were dismissed when the
government's sole witness died.11

#### Plea bargaining is key to accomplice testimony which breaks down terror rings through successful prosecution

[[When attempting to break up]{.mark} criminal and [terrorist

[associates]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Although some may argue that there

[is]{.mark} usually considered [**essential** to the **successful**
detection and **prosecution** of terrorism]{.mark} and organized
crime]{.underline}.\" As a result, [various international agreements and
conventions actively promote these methods]{.underline}.\' National laws
are sometimes also necessary to authorize these practices and to

importance of]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[accomplice

of immunity or leniency often [**play a crucial role** in the gathering
of evidence and]{.mark} the [successful prosecution]{.mark} of these

as a means of eliciting cooperation from criminal informants, are
intertwined with other measures such as plea bargaining, immunity from
prosecution and reduced sentences.

#### Plea deals maximize the certainty of punishment 

**Howe 05** \[Scott W. Howe, law professor, former Public Defender for
D.C., Deputy Director of the Texas Death Penalty Resource Center, and
co-author of California Criminal Law textbooks, 2005, "The Value of Plea
Bargaining", Oklahoma Law Review,
https://digitalcommons.law.ou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1240&context=olr\]/Kankee

Prosecutors and judges work to ensure that plea bargaining, relative to
trials, does not shortchange the public interest in punishment.
Circumstances vary from one jurisdiction to another regarding the nature
of their political accountability.  However, in almost all states,
District Attorneys are elected, as are trial judges in the vast majority
of states.  Even in states 26 in which prosecutors or judges are
appointed, elected officials generally appoint ambitious lawyers who
hope to be reappointed or to be appointed or elected to another position
in the future.  They generally give due regard to 27 28 public concern
about leniency in plea bargaining.  Apart from their political
motivations, they must also sympathize with the view, regularly
reinforced by crime victims, that criminals should receive their
deserved punishment. Because of these motivations, prosecutors and
judges will weigh what they perceive as the deserved punishment against
the benefits they see in a 29 30 disposition by plea.  Officials measure
deserved punishments differently; the perceived benefits of a guilty
plea vary from one case to the next, and jurisdictions vary regarding
perceptions of the need to promote guilty pleas generally.  Nonetheless,
prosecutors and judges prefer higher sentences to lower sentences, up to
the sentence that they believe the defendant actually deserves.
[Prosecutors and judges willingly trade some deserved punishment in
individual cases to [maximize the punishments]{.mark} they can
secure.]{.underline}  They must make this trade-off because they have
limited resources.  The trade-off works 31 because convictions by jury
trial require far more of their resources than bargained guilty pleas
and because both parties in a criminal case have incentives to avoid the
uncertainties of litigation.  32 Prosecutors and judges could try always
to seek the maximum deserved punishment, but most defendants would
demand a jury trial, and, assuming no changes in the governing
constraints, the system would quickly become inadequate.  Courts would
necessarily dismiss cases in which legitimate charges had been filed due
to the inability to prosecute them.  Furthermore, prosecutors would
decline to bring charges in many legitimate cases.  Given these
circumstances, prosecutors and judges maximize punishment by extending
some leniency for guilty pleas.  [They obtain a certain conviction with
some punishment in the case at hand and a large time savings that can be
used to prosecute other cases.33 [Plea bargains bring about an enormous
**punishment-maximizing effect**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Suppose that we
are in a jurisdiction in which the prosecutor bargains not only over
charges and sentencing recommendations but actual sentences, with the
judge merely holding veto power.  Assume that a prosecutor has six armed
34 robbery cases to prosecute, among many others.  She has spoken to the
six defense lawyers and concluded that each case carries a ten percent
chance of acquittal, but that the deserved and probable sentence for
each defendant after a jury-trial conviction is fifteen years of
imprisonment.  The maximum possible sentence is twenty years, and no
mandatory-minimum sentencing requirement applies.  She concludes that
each case will require six hours of court time for a jury trial and one
hour of court time for a guilty-plea hearing.  In a six-hour period, she
could try one case and, hopefully, secure 35 a conviction, which would
probably result in a fifteen-year sentence.  The other five defendants
would not be prosecuted.  Alternatively, in that same period, she could
proceed with six guilty plea hearings and obtain certain convictions. 
Suppose that the prosecutor knows that each defendant would accept a
plea bargain if it carried only five years of imprisonment.  Which
option better serves the public interest in punishing crime?  Obviously,
[six pleas at five years apiece is better than a ninety percent
possibility of a single fifteen-year sentence.]{.underline}  The goal of
maximizing punishments compellingly favors bargaining.36 [The
[punishment-maximizing effect of bargained pleas over trials is much
greater in reality]{.mark} than even this hypothetical
reveals.]{.underline}  The average jury trial requires substantially
more than six hours and also involves several pre-trial hearings and
much preparation time by the prosecutor.  Likewise, the average guilty
plea hearing requires well under an hour and minimal preparation. With
the very conservative assumptions in the hypothetical, plea bargains
still produced twice as much total punishment as any possible punishment
that would be produced by the trial.  The punishment differential would
increase exponentially if we used more realistic assumptions. This
hypothetical also shows that bargaining will usually maximize punishment
vis-à-vis jury trials even if the prosecutor does not pursue the highest
possible sentence she could have obtained without scuttling the plea.
All of the defendants in the hypothetical might easily have accepted
ten-year or even twelve-year bargains, and the prosecutor would likely
have had incentives to seek those higher sentences. 37  However, the
punishmentmaximizing power of plea bargaining is so great that even
unnecessary and fairly extreme leniency by the prosecutor will not
subvert the punishmentmaximizing effect of deals.  Bargaining will still
produce more punishment than trials. [[Variances]{.mark} among
defendants in the distribution of leniency [will]{.mark} also [not
affect the conclusion that]{.mark} [pleas produce **more punishment than
trials**.]{.mark}]{.underline}  Suppose that, instead of offering each
defendant a five-year deal, the prosecutor offered two of them nine
years, two others five years, and the final two only one year, and each
accepted.  This distribution of leniency appears irrational under the
posited circumstances.  However, the results of the plea option still
seem more rational than the results of the trial option, where all of
the punishment would fall on a single defendant.  Moreover, the better
choice for purposes of maximizing deserved punishment remains the plea
bargains. [Given these observations, it is clear that the
shadow-of-trial efficiency theory has no practical bearing on whether
pleas, as opposed to jury trials, maximize deserved
punishment.]{.underline}  Surely, prosecutors often weigh the probable
outcome of the potential trial in deciding how much leniency to extend
in a plea deal.  They also surely consider factors related to
adjudication costs, particularly how much of their time the case would
require.  However, the 38 accuracy of these judgments is irrelevant as a
practical matter to whether bargaining, compared to trials, provides
undue leniency.  If only two guilty pleas could be traded for one
jury-trial conviction, the accuracy of discounting efforts would matter,
but not where the trade-off is far higher than six.  The prosecutor in
our hypothetical could arrive at bargain decisions by rolling dice, and
bargaining would almost certainly still maximize punishments far more
than a policy of no bargaining.39 Within the constraints of our current
system, shadow-of-trial efficiency theory turns out to be an
inappropriate measure even for maximizing deserved punishments among
plea-bargained cases.  The theory posits that expected trial and
post-trial sentencing outcomes, accurately discounted to reflect
uncertainty and adjudication costs, define efficient plea bargaining. 
But why 40 should the societal goal be to secure no more than the
accurately discounted trial outcome?  [[To maximize deserved
punishments, we would **prefer the highest deserved punishment** the
prosecutor could obtain on a plea,]{.mark} regardless of whether the
defendant seems sensible in accepting the bargain.]{.underline}  Suppose
that the prosecutor in our hypothetical could secure plea bargains of
fourteen years imprisonment from each defendant.  The bargains might be
inefficient in the sense that the defendants misjudged their chances of
acquittal or their probable post-trial sentences.  However, if the
societal goal is to maximize deserved punishment, their blunder brings
about positive results. The shadow-of-trial efficiency theory misleads
us in evaluating plea bargaining.  The theory implies that plea
bargaining is socially valuable only to the extent that it reflects
accurately discounted trial outcomes.  However, Professors Schulhofer
and Bibas have shown why plea bargaining generally does not produce such
outcomes.  Their critiques also reveal that it probably 41 42 never
will, regardless of reform efforts.  One could easily conclude from this
analysis that plea bargaining should be ended. 43 44  Professor
Schulhofer has made this very argument.  Even those who have used the
shadow-of-trial 45 efficiency theory to defend bargaining have posited
that there are "social losses" to inefficient bargains.  However,
because this efficiency standard 46 actually does not correspond to the
social gains and losses associated with plea bargaining, we should not
judge the validity of plea bargaining from our failure to achieve it.

### Contention 9: Circumvention

#### Plea bargaining is inevitable and the neg is circumvented via open pleas, worsening sentences

**Bellin 23** \[Jeffrey Bellin, Stanford Law graduate and former federal
prosecutor, clerked for Judge Merrick Garland, elected member of the
American Law Institute, 2023, "Plea Bargaining\'s Uncertainty Problem",
William & Mary Law School Scholarship Repository,
https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3163&context=facpubs\]/Kankee

Stories like these make it unsurprising that "there is no part of the
criminal process more pilloried than the plea bargain."15 Still, as Dan
Epps notes, "scholars have struggled to pinpoint why exactly plea
bargaining is problematic."16 As a result, commentators have, so far,
united only behind their distaste for the phenomenon, rather than
specific reforms.17 The complexity begins with a recognition of the
trial penalty's inevitability. Defendants plead guilty when they
perceive a benefit to doing so. And if defendants like Troy McAlister
receive a benefit, those who are convicted after trial suffer a trial
penalty by comparison. [The only way to eliminate this dynamic would be
to prohibit guilty pleas]{.underline}. Yet as George Fisher has
documented, [[plea bargaining]{.mark} **triumphed** in America because
it [is an **inevitable** outgrowth]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [an **adversary**
system characterized by **independent** prosecutors, **crowded**
dockets, and **severe** penal laws]{.mark}.]{.underline}18 Sporadic
[attempts to  abolish plea bargaining have been
**short-lived**]{.underline}, and other [countries where plea bargaining
is less prevalent are moving towards, not away from, the American
model]{.underline}.19 Further complicating the picture,
[the]{.underline} most immediate [impact]{.underline} of abolishing plea
bargaining [could be to **increase the severity** of a notoriously
punitive system]{.underline}.20 The best evidence of this comes from
[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, a jurisdiction that [forbade plea
bargaining in 1975]{.underline}. [During the short time the ban was
enforced, [guilty pleas]{.mark} [continued at]{.mark} almost [the **same
rate**]{.mark} ([without concessions]{.mark} from the prosecution)
[and]{.mark} ["\[s\]entences became **more
severe**]{.mark}."]{.underline}21 As in Alaska, real-world efforts to
eliminate plea bargains typically stem from a desire to increase (not
decrease) sentencing severity.22 New York's infamous Rockefeller Drug
Laws paired severe mandatory sentences with strict limits on plea
bargains.23 The 1982 "Victim's Bill of Rights" enacted by
[[California]{.underline}]{.mark} voters similarly prohibited
prosecutors from "\[[p\]lea bargaining]{.underline} in any case in which
the indictment or information charges any serious felony."24 As in Troy
McAlister's case, these [[prohibitions are]{.mark} typically 
**[ignored]{.mark}**]{.underline}.25 But [these [**futile**
efforts]{.mark} to block plea deals like the lenient one McAlister
received [illustrate]{.mark} both the practical difficulty of abolishing
the practice and the dangers to criminal defendants of doing
so.]{.underline}26 Confronted with these complexities, reformers often
retreat to generic solutions. The most common is reducing sentence
lengths. Prodding judges to impose shorter sentences,27 legislators to
eliminate mandatory minimums,28 and prosecutors to charge fewer and less
serious offenses29 all have the effect of blunting plea bargaining's
sharp edges.30 But [improving plea bargaining is a **coincidental side
effect**]{.underline} of these laudable reforms. [[Fewer cases and
shorter sentences **mitigate** every **coercive aspect** of the criminal
justice system.]{.underline}]{.mark} [It is the equivalent of shutting
off the water to fix a leak. It works, but it **masks** an inability to
diagnose the problem]{.underline}. This Article attempts to isolate the
problem with American plea bargaining. Specifically, it strives to
identify something about plea bargaining that is both objectionable and
distinct from background problems of American criminal law enforcement.
The second part of this formula is critical. [[Critics often denounce
plea bargaining for flaws it does not create.]{.underline}]{.mark} For
example, the most common critique, illustrated in the opening paragraph,
condemns plea bargaining because X defendant was offered five years,
went to trial, and received twenty. But this ignores that the long
sentence driving  the injustice in these examples is a product of the
background law---a stark baseline that could become a more (not less)
likely outcome in plea bargaining's absence. 

#### Bans are circumvented via open guilty pleas, decreasing plaintiff leverage by offering a plea without a guarantee of lower charges

**Canon 22** \[Dan Canon, civil rights lawyer and a law professor at the
University of Louisville in Kentucky, 2022, "Pleading Out: How Plea
Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class," Basic Books,
ISBN-139781541674684\]/Kankee

BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT REALISTIC SOLUTIONS, IT MAY BE helpful to clarify
what I'm not arguing in this book. First, I'm not suggesting that no one
be allowed to plead guilty. As you know by now, there's a big difference
between simply pleading guilty and plea bargaining. [Pleading guilty,
without the expectation of a let's-get-it-over-with-quick bonus, often
makes sense.]{.underline} It can come as a shock to anyone accused of a
crime when their lawyer tells them they should plead "not guilty" at
their first court appearance, even when they are clearly guilty. You can
tell a naive, privileged client from an experienced criminal; the former
will always protest their lawyer's advice: "I am guilty! I really did
it! Isn't that dishonest?" But in most jurisdictions, pleading not
guilty is the norm at the first court appearance. We have to explain to
them that we're just delaying the inevitable in order to get the best
deal we can for them. Many first timers don't understand that, either.
They ask "Why would the charges change?" There's usually not such a
great answer for that one. Nor is there a great answer to the question
of "Why waste all this time and energy if someone is actually guilty?"
[To date, [no]{.mark}ne of the [jurisdictions]{.mark} within the United
States [that]{.mark} have [experimented with bans]{.mark} on plea
bargaining have [seen]{.mark} [an end to guilty pleas
altogether.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead, a large portion of
[cases]{.underline} still [end up getting resolved via open
pleas]{.underline}, as we saw in Alaska and El Paso. [That means the
prosecutor says, "These are the charges," and they really are the
charges, which is good for the integrity of the criminal justice
system.]{.underline} The prosecutor does not say,  "If you don't plead
guilty now, we'll put these extra charges on you," or "If you don't take
five years, we're going to ask a jury for life." [[The defendant pleads
guilty, and the defense lawyer then prepares an argument about why the
accused should receive a lesser punishment]{.mark}---five years instead
of ten, one instead of five, probation instead of prison time at all,
depending on the range set by the sentencing laws.]{.underline} The
prosecutor may argue for a stiffer penalty, or they may not. The victim,
if any, may also have input. The judge, or a jury, makes the final call.
And [[this decision]{.mark}, because it doesn't come with the waiver of
rights included in the price for a "contract" with the state, [is
appealable]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, if an accused doesn't
like the final sentence  imposed by a judge or jury, they can ask a
higher court to review it, thus removing, at least somewhat, the problem
of oversight inherent in the "plea- bargain-as-contract" model. Second,
[[it **isn't realistic to** advocate a total **ban** on plea bargaining
in the United States.]{.underline}]{.mark} Where such [bans]{.underline}
have been attempted, they [have always been **patchy** and
**inconsistent**]{.underline}, [lasting only as long as the district
attorney or judge who imposed the ban manages to stay in
office]{.underline} (and sometimes not even that long, as we saw in the
Bronx). There is something about the culture of US criminal justice, or
perhaps something in the DNA of lawyers worldwide, that cries out for
some autonomy, some bargaining capability, some "sort\[ing\] it all out
sensibly, wigs off," as Judge Pickles put it. Even with a total ban on 
plea bargaining, history shows that under-the-radar haggling would find
a way to creep back in.

 

#### Bargain abolition fails and drives bargaining underground -- economic theory proves

A. Prohibition and Its Discontents Plea bargaining's staunchest critics
argue that the only fix to the unacceptable pressure that plea
bargaining imposes on innocent defendants to plead guilty is the
outright abolition of plea bargaining. 227 Under the abolitionist (or as
this Article refers to it, the "prohibition- ist") view, even if plea
bargaining perfectly reflected trial outcome probabilities (which it
does not), plea bargaining would still be unjust and unacceptable. 228
Although there may be proceduralist and systemic reasons to prohibit
plea bargaining, 229 from the perspective of plea pricing, the
prohibitionists' case is at best uncertain. 230 The prohibitionists
contend that plea bargaining harms the innocent by inducing them to
plead guilty to crimes they did not commit. 231 The mechanism of
inducement is the plea discount/trial penalty. Abolish plea bargaining
and the trial penalty necessarily disappears. 232 Although it is by
definition true that the prohibition of plea bargaining would eradicate
the "trial penalty," as noted above, [[plea discounts are an]{.mark}
[**inherent** part of the]{.mark} true [economic value]{.mark} of the
decision to forfeit the right to trial.]{.underline} 233 [It
is]{.underline} as economically **[irrational]{.underline}** [to view a
plea discount as inherently unjust as it is to decry the fact that stock
options have positive value even when the underlying stock trades below
the option exercise price]{.underline}. Innocent defendants need some
other compensation in exchange for abolishing the plea discount. [[From
the perspective of **price theory**]{.mark}, prohibition appears
problematic.]{.underline} Economists generally disfavor prohibitions on
trade. 234 [[Prohibition]{.mark} prevents mutually beneficial exchanges
of goods, disrupts normal market functioning, and almost
**[invariably]{.mark}** [leads to]{.mark} the creation of parallel
[black market]{.mark} [structures]{.mark}]{.underline}. 235 [Black
markets]{.underline}, in turn, [are [**difficult** to regulate or
control and create]{.mark} additional [negative externalities]{.mark}
that impose unwanted costs on the economy]{.underline}. 236 [What little
empirical evidence there is regarding attempts to abolish plea
bargaining suggests that prohibition in the plea bargaining context is
no different than elsewhere.]{.underline}237 [[In
Philadelphia]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, the number of guilty
pleas is far lower than in most comparable jurisdictions. 238 However,
[[guilty pleas are]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[replaced by bench
trials that]{.underline}]{.mark} some allege
[[function]{.underline}]{.mark}, in essence, [[like **slow** guilty
pleas]{.underline}]{.mark}. 239 [[Alaska's experiment]{.mark} with a
plea-bargaining ban [led]{.mark}, over time, [to]{.mark} the replacement
of sentence bargaining with [charge bargaining]{.mark}, 240 suggesting
that [attempts to abolish formal]{.mark} [bargaining]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} likely [result in]{.mark} the emergence of
[**alternative**, informal, forms of bargaining]{.mark}.]{.underline}
241 In short, prohibition of plea bargaining is as difficult to enforce
as any other prohibition in the face of strong demand, and only channels
demand into black markets. Prohibition is not, in any event, a realistic
option. Few lawyers actually believe that our criminal justice system
could survive without substantial reliance on plea bargaining. B. Plea
Market Regulation 

#### Link turn -- trial systems worsen mass incarceration by causing everyone to suffer the trial penalty

**Johnson 22** \[Thea Johnson, associate professor of law at Rutgers Law
School, 06-01-2022, Lying at Plea Bargaining," Georgia State University
Law Review,
[https://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3139&context=gsulr\]/Kankee](https://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3139&context=gsulr%5d/Kankee)

Legal scholars have also made this argument. In their piece, A Welfarist
Perspective on Lies, Ariel Porat and Omri Yadlin reason that certain
lies are valuable and therefore should be permitted because they promote
social goals.195 For instance, where a prospective employee lies to a
company about his religion because the company intends to discriminate
against him if it knows his true (as in accurate) religion, a welfarist
perspective would allow the employee to lie.196 [This is a version of
the [**lesser-evil** argument; to lie is bad, unless the lie achieves
the social value of avoiding what is both illegal and immoral
discrimination]{.mark}.]{.underline} Julia Simon-Kerr points out that
this consequentialist justification is why many legal actors lie.197 For
instance, if the stakeholders believe the system will not produce just
results, they may feel permitted to lie.198 Indeed, the pro-flexibility
reformer will argue that transparency on this issue will actually ramp
up the harshness of the law. [If legislatures are alerted to the fact
that prosecutors sometimes skirt sex offender registration laws through
the plea process, one---politically appetizing---solution might be to
legislatively [ban]{.mark} such plea bargaining, [forcing]{.mark} nearly
[**everyone** arrested for a felony sex offense to be registered as a
sex offender]{.mark}. Or [judges]{.mark}, if forced to be transparent
about all the horse-trading that occurs in their courtroom, [may
become]{.mark} totally [**inflexible**]{.mark} on plea bargaining in
general, [leading to poor outcomes for defendants]{.mark} across the
board.]{.underline} The pro-flexibility advocate might also note that
although more transparency and less flexibility may lead to more trials,
[[trials are not]{.mark} necessarily [a good thing for]{.mark}
[defendants]{.mark}]{.underline} or even prosecutors. Trials  subject
both sides to the whims of [[jurors]{.underline}]{.mark}, who [[may be
influenced by]{.mark} **[bias]{.mark}**]{.underline}201 [[or unable to
understand **complicated** legal matters]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
[[trials]{.mark} also [expose defendants to]{.mark} **[mandatory
minimums]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} mandatory [collateral
consequences]{.mark}---the very reasons that they resort to lying in the
first place. In short, [lying is meant to mitigate the effects of a
cruel system; transparency would only make that cruelty **less
escapable**.]{.mark}]{.underline} For this reason, the pro-flexibility
reformer argues that the solution to the problem is to view plea
bargaining as something akin to civil settlement, where the parties
decide what is best for the two sides and negotiate accordingly, even if
such negotiations result in agreements that are not entirely accurate.
In this way, a different sort of transparency is achieved; one in which
the reality of the current system is recognized, but the parties are
given free rein to work around the  system where needed. This still
leaves the possibility of reform around the edges---for instance,
through discovery reform---but keeps intact the fundamental vehicle for
achieving rough justice, the unfettered plea bargain.

I. Juries The Leniart case was unusual in that the defendant actually
went to trial. Fewer than 5 percent of all convictions in the United
States are the result of a jury trial, which means that juries do not
decide cases all that often. But [[the jury remains]{.mark} one of
[the]{.mark} system's **[most important]{.mark}** structural [checks on
informant reliability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} [threat of a
tria]{.mark}l in which a snitch might have to testify in open court [is
an incentive for]{.mark} [law enforcement to ensure]{.mark} that its
[informants]{.mark} [are accurate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Once at trial,
[the informant must]{.underline} [convince]{.underline} a jury of
[ordinary]{.underline} [people]{.underline} that he or [she is telling
the truth]{.underline}. The jury will typically learn that [the
informant is receiving a benefit for their testimony and may hear about
previous instances in which the informant testified in exchange for
lenience]{.underline}. In some jurisdictions, [[the court
will]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[instruct the jury]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark} [informant]{.mark}'s testimony [should be **carefully
scrutinized** for]{.mark} potential
**[unreliability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Trials]{.mark} also [perform
an important public **transparency**]{.mark} [function]{.mark}: [it is
only]{.mark} when [a]{.mark} defendant decides to go [trial]{.mark} that
[the public will learn about]{.mark} the [informants]{.mark} that the
government uses to make its case]{.underline}. In 1966, [in Hoffa v.
United States]{.underline}, the Supreme Court upheld the con-
stitutionality of using and rewarding criminal informants. [[The Court
approved the practice]{.mark} in large part [because]{.mark} it believed
that [the jury]{.mark} [trial provides a]{.mark} good [check against the
risks of compensated criminal wit- nesses notwithstanding their **strong
incentives to lie**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Court relied on what it
called "\[[t\]he established [safeguards]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
Anglo-American legal system \[that\] [[leave the veracity of a witness
to be tested by **cross-**]{.mark} **[examination]{.mark}**\[\]
[and]{.mark} the [credibility]{.mark} of his testimony [to be determined
by a]{.mark} properly instructed **[jury]{.mark}**]{.underline}."3 The
Supreme Court was partially right: sometimes jurors can be an effective
check against lying informants. One prominent observer, Judge Stephen
Trott, himself a former federal prosecutor, concludes that "\[o\]rdinary
decent people are predisposed to dislike, distrust, and frequently
despise criminals who 'sell out' and become prosecution wit- nesses.
Jurors suspect their motives from the moment they hear about them in a
case, and they frequently disregard their testimony altogether as highly
untrustworthy and unreliable, openly expressing disgust with the
prosecution for making deals with such 'scum.'"4 Juror distrust, for
example, cost the government its massive 1981 racketeering case against
the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. In that case, jurors felt that the
government's key witnesses---former Hell's Angels members, one of whom
was paid \$30,000---were "despicable and be- neath contempt."5 That same
kind of distrust led to Todd Ruffin's acquit- tal by a Connecticut jury
for the charge of selling drugs to an informant. "They just didn't
believe a word \[the informant\] said," said the prosecutor, who spoke
with jurors after the trial. "He has a terrible record, so they felt he
was inherently untruthful."6

#### Prosecutors exploit plea bargains to hide unreliable informants and police coverups, convicting innocents. Unlike trials, there are [no protections]{.underline} against bad evidence

IV\. When the Innocent Plead Guilty Most [American defendants do not
litigate or challenge the evidence of their guilt. Rather, they plead
guilty. This practical reality reduces the salience of accuracy. [Plea
bargaining]{.mark} [turns evidence and accuracy into commodities]{.mark}
that are [traded]{.mark} and negotiated along with many other inputs
into the bargaining process]{.underline}. As a result, many innocent
[defen- dants conclude that it is in their best overall interests to
plead guilty to crimes they did not actually commit]{.underline}.
[**[Twenty percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[wrongful convictions]{.mark} listed in the National Registry of
Exonerations [are]{.mark} the result of [a plea]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
misdemeanor cases, [hundreds of thousands of innocent people routinely
plead guilty]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} get out of jail so
they can [go home]{.underline} and [care for their children, keep their
jobs, or avoid eviction]{.underline}.41 For the vast majority of
defendants who must negotiate under these conditions, a lying informant
can alter the calculus about whether to go to trial. [[The]{.mark} [mere
threat of an informant witness can make it more likely]{.mark} that [an
innocent defendant will take a plea rather than risk]{.mark} conviction
and the substantially higher sentences that flow from losing at
trial]{.underline}. In 2008, for example, fourteen men in Cleveland,
Ohio, were found by a federal judge to have pled guilty to false charges
levied by a DEA infor- mant. The first defendant in the case, a mother
of three, insisted on her innocence, went to trial, and was wrongfully
convicted. She received a sentence of ten years. The remaining fourteen
men then pled guilty in exchange for lower sentences.42 In Hearne,
Texas, several innocent defendants pled guilty after being accused by
informant Derrick Me- gress, even though Megress was later shown to be
lying. Similarly, two innocent people in Tracy City, Tennessee, pled
guilty after Tina Prater alleged that she had bought drugs from them,
even though she hadn't.43 This kind of tragic calculus occurs throughout
the penal system, al- though the nature of plea bargaining and the
appellate process make it impossible to know how often it happens.
[Innocent defendants plead guilty]{.underline} for a number of reasons.
[They may think that they will lose at trial and that their punishment
will be heavier than the one offered in a plea. The federal sentencing
guidelines expressly encourage this sort of calculation by imposing
longer sentences, [the]{.mark} "[trial penalty]{.mark}," on de- fendants
who do not take a plea]{.underline}.44 Defendants may also plead guilty
because they are being held in jail on bail that they cannot afford to
pay and a plea provides the immediate freedom of probation or a sentence
of time served. Or they may plead guilty because their lawyers tell them
to or because they are ignorant of their rights and other options. They
may even plead guilty because they think they are guilty of an offense
when they are not. Professors Samuel Gross and Barbara O'Brien conclude
that [it is al- most impossible to determine how many innocent
defendants plead guilty]{.underline}, because [false convictions are
"invisible at their inception]{.underline}." Most defendants who plead
guilty do not appeal, and even if they do [[it is diffi- cult to
overturn a guilty plea]{.mark}, [which means]{.mark} that "\[t\]he
[exonerations]{.mark} that we know about [are overwhelmingly for]{.mark}
convictions at [trial]{.mark}]{.underline}."45 Some- times, however,
wrongful pleas do make it to the public record. Writing in 2008, Gross
and O'Brien described some infamous examples: We do know about a
substantial number of exonerations of innocent de- fendants who pled
guilty and received comparatively light sentences---in one particularly
disturbing factual context. In the past decade, several systemic
programs of police perjury have been uncovered, which ulti- mately led
to exonerations of at least 135 innocent defendants who had been framed
for illegal possession of drugs or guns in Los Angeles, in Dallas, and
in Tulia, Texas. . . . Most of these innocent drug and gun de- fendants
pled guilty, and had been released by the time they were exoner- ated
two to four years later.46 Each of these three "particularly
[disturbing" examples involved crimi- nal
[informants]{.mark}]{.underline} and/or undercover narcotics agents
operating in the mode of an informant. In the Los Angeles Rampart
scandal, [officers used informants to [set up innocent
targets]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Dallas, police used informants [to
[plant fake drugs]{.mark} on suspects]{.underline}. In Tulia, Texas, a
single undercover narcotics officer [[fabricated]{.mark} drug
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} against dozens of African American
targets. In sum, while [we do not know how many [innocent defendants
plead guilty]{.mark}, we know that it happens [on a **regular
basis**]{.mark} and that [informants are a dangerous aspect]{.mark} of
the problem]{.underline}. [[When a]{.mark} criminal [informant fin- gers
an innocent person]{.mark}, the [pressures]{.mark} of the criminal
system may [drive that person to plead guilty]{.mark} rather than face
worse consequences]{.underline}. This is especially true for defendants
with prior criminal records, who are less likely to be presumed innocent
by law enforcement officials and jurors. It is also especially true for
defendants with overworked, underpaid public defense counsel who lack
the resources to fully investigate and litigate the case.47 Moreover,
[in order to avoid trial and protect the identity of the informant,
prosecutors may offer reduced charges]{.underline}, probation, or lower
sentences [to persuade a defendant not to contest the case]{.underline}.
The tragedy remains invisible because [the informant's misinformation is
never tested or revealed. [Because]{.mark} the vast majority of [cases
are resolved through guilty pleas]{.mark} rather than trials,
[the]{.mark} possibilities for this sort of [miscarriage of jus- tice
are]{.mark} both [**widespread** and]{.mark} nearly **[impossible to
discover]{.mark}** after the fact.]{.underline} V. The Important but
Limited Role of Procedural Protections Legislators increasingly
recognize the unreliability of criminal infor- mants and the inadequacy
of existing procedural protections. Numerous jurisdictions have
considered and implemented a variety of legisla- tive reforms aimed at
reducing the likelihood of wrongful convictions. These reforms are
discussed in depth in chapter 8; they include such things as
corroboration requirements, reliability hearings, and stronger discovery
and disclosure requirements when the government seeks to use informants
as witnesses. Better [[procedural protections]{.underline}]{.mark}
improve the chances that the defense will be able to uncover an
informant's lies, and as such they are impor- tant tools in protecting
against wrongful convictions. But such proce- dures [are inherently
limited because they do not address the underlying phenomena that drive
the use of unreliable informants]{.underline}. First, many such
[procedures are applicable only at trial and therefore [do not]{.mark}
directly [af- fect plea bargains]{.mark}]{.underline}, namely, [the
source of the **vast majority** of criminal convictions]{.underline}.
[They]{.underline} also [do not affect the process of using informants
in investigations or to obtain warrants, techniques that lead to
thousands of bad searches and arrests every year]{.underline}. At best,
they indirectly shift po- lice and prosecutorial incentives to rely on
unreliable informants in shaping basic decisions about investigations,
arrests, and charging. More fundamentally, however, [procedural
protections do not alter the basic structure of the informant market.
They do not reduce infor- mants' underlying incentives to lie in the
first place; nor do they regu- late the vast discretion that law
enforcement wields in negotiating the informant deal]{.underline}. For
all these reasons, procedural reforms are only one aspect---albeit an
important one---of the larger challenges posed by un- reliable
informants. 5 Secret Justice

II\. Plea Bargaining Approximately [**95 percent** of all criminal
convictions]{.underline} in the United States [are the result of a
guilty [plea]{.mark}]{.underline}.21 This means that
[trials]{.underline} and liti- gation [are rare, while negotiated deals
are overwhelmingly the **[norm]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This fact
[has]{.mark} [implications]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
**[transparency]{.mark}** of the criminal system. While [trials]{.mark}
[and hearings are public]{.mark}, [plea bargaining is
**private**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Litigated facts]{.mark}
[become]{.mark} part of the **[public record]{.mark}**, [while
negotiated facts]{.mark} [remain off the record]{.mark}, [known]{.mark}
[only to]{.mark} the bargaining [parties]{.mark}. The trend toward [plea
bargaining]{.mark} [has]{.mark} thus been [accompanied]{.mark} by a
trend toward [the **depublicization** of the criminal
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Info]{.mark}rmation [gathered by the
government]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} the [investigative methods]{.mark}
[used]{.mark} to get it---are [increas- ingly difficult]{.mark} for the
public [to learn about]{.mark}]{.underline}. Public information about
the kinds of crimes that are actually committed and by whom is like-
wise disappearing, replaced by information about the outcomes of deals
struck between the government and defendants. [[As criminal liability is
increasingly resolved privately through deals, the public **loses
sight** of the way the system]{.mark} really]{.underline}
[[works]{.underline}]{.mark}. As federal judge Stephanos Bibas once
wrote, inside players such as prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges
have quite a bit of information about the way the system operates, but
[[the public experiences the criminal process as]{.mark} "[**opaque**,
tangled, insu- lated, and **impervious** to outside scrutiny]{.mark} and
change]{.underline}."22 The informant deal is an extreme version of the
guilty plea, a kind of hyper-deregulated, extra-secretive bargain. An
informant deal resem- bles a plea in that it resolves the informant's
potential criminal liability, at least temporarily, in exchange for
information. It is also like a plea bargain in that the resolution of
liability is negotiated and takes place in private between the law
enforcement official and the defendant or perhaps a defense attorney.

#### Plea bargains destroy public jurisprudence and transparency that safeguard accountability and open democracy

IV\. Public Transparency and Executive Accountability The culture of
secrecy surrounding informant use is in tension with some fundamental
aspects of American criminal justice. Our penal sys- tem promises
transparency and public access to information in ways that are important
not only to the adjudication of specific cases but to the democratic
process itself. As Professor Gary Marx wrote in his sem- inal book
Undercover: Police Surveillance in America, "\[s[\]ecret police behavior
and surveillance go to the heart of the kind of society we are or might
become]{.underline}."37 [[From the]{.mark} **Sixth Amendment** [right to
a]{.mark} public [trial]{.mark}]{.underline} to the First Amendment
rights of free speech and press, many aspects of [[our]{.mark} criminal
[system]{.mark} [demand]{.mark} that cases and processes be made public
so that voters, legislators, and the media can view the workings of the
executive branch]{.underline}. The Supreme Court [explains]{.underline}
this commitment to [[transparency as]{.mark} a form of governmental
[accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The idea that criminal processes,
records, and results should be public, or what [the Court]{.mark} has
[referred to]{.mark} as [the]{.mark} "**[right to gather
information]{.mark}**]{.underline},"38 [is part of a larger democratic
commitment to public accountability and responsiveness]{.underline}. In
discussing "the therapeutic value of open justice," the Court quoted the
philosopher Jeremy Bentham: **[[Without publicity, all other checks are
insufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [in comparison of pub- licity, all
other checks are of small account]{.underline}. [Recordation, appeal,
whatever other institutions might present themselves in the character of
checks, would be found to operate rather as cloaks than checks; as
cloaks in real- ity, as checks only in appearance]{.underline}.39
[Information access is]{.underline} also [connected to political and
intellectual free- dom]{.underline}. In establishing [the public's right
to observe criminal proceedings]{.underline}, the Court has said: "[The
**First** **Amendment** goes]{.underline} beyond protection of the press
and the self-expression of individuals to [prohibit government from
limiting the stock of information from which members of the pub- lic may
draw]{.underline}."40 Because [transparency and public access to
information are so impor- tant, they cannot be dispensed with
lightly]{.underline}. [If [the government]{.mark} wants to keep
information secret, it [must justify]{.mark} that [secrecy against a
**pre- sumption of**]{.mark} **[openness]{.mark}** [and the value
of]{.mark} maintaining [a]{.mark} public and **[open]{.mark}** [justice
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Supreme Court has written: "The
presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest
based on find- ings that closure is essential to preserve higher values
and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest."41 For example, in a
1985 decision, then--Judge (now former Justice) Anthony Kennedy unsealed
an informant's file because the government and the informant had failed
to justify the need for secrecy.42 In that case, informant William
Hetrick had pled guilty to drug and tax evasion charges. The media
sought access to Hetrick's request for a sentence re- duction in
connection with his testimony against celebrity automobile executive
John DeLorean. At the request of both Hetrick and the gov- ernment, the
district court sealed the proceedings. The court of appeals ordered that
they be unsealed. Kennedy explained as follows: [We begin with the
presumption that the public and the press have a right of access to
criminal proceedings and documents filed therein. . . . The primary
justifications for access to criminal proceedings \[have been\] first
that criminal trials historically have been open to the press and to the
public, and, second, that access to criminal trials plays a significant
role in the functioning of the judicial process and the governmental
sys- tem]{.underline}. . . . The interest which overrides the
presumption of open proce- dures must be specified with particularity,
and there must be findings that the closure remedy is narrowly confined
to protect that interest. . . . The penal structure is the least
visible, least understood, least effective part of the justice system;
and each such failure is consequent from the others. [[Public
examination]{.mark}, study, and comment [is **essential** if the]{.mark}
corrections [process is to improve]{.mark}]{.underline}.43 The meaning
of such reasoning is that [the need for]{.underline} informant [secrecy
should not be assumed]{.underline}; rather, it must be evaluated each
time on the specific facts of each case. Even though "information
relating to cooper- ating witnesses and criminal investigations should
be kept confidential in some cases,"44 the countervailing importance of
public access must be accounted for every time. **[When in doubt,
transparency is supposed to win]{.underline}**. [Blanket acceptance of
informant anonymity, undocumented deals, or sealed case files
contradicts this fundamental idea]{.underline}. Another important
feature of the Supreme Court's **[publicity jurispru-
dence]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} the [critical]{.underline} role of
the defendant [in producing public information]{.underline}. Even as the
Court recognizes the public's need to understand the way the system
works, it assumes that the adversarial process produces enough
information to satisfy that need.45 As the Court puts it: "In an
adversary system of criminal justice, [the public interest in the
administration of justice is protected by the participants in the
litigation]{.underline}."46 Essentially, [the public gets to watch only
those trials that the parties actually decide to conduct. By permitting
[public access]{.mark} to record information produced [by]{.mark} actual
[cases]{.mark}, the Court's idea is that [the public will]{.mark} obtain
a sufficiently full and accurate picture of the way the criminal system
works to [satisfy]{.mark} underlying **[First Amendment]{.mark}**
[free-speech and info]{.mark}rmation-[gathering
values]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this sense, [defendants function as
**vital proxies** for the broader public interest in access to
government information]{.underline}. When it comes to informant use,
however, this model breaks down because snitching practices undermine
the Court's assumption that par- ties to criminal litigation will
produce a robust public record. As plea bargaining and informant use
curtail defendant access to information about law enforcement practices,
so, too, is public information reduced. To put it another way: [one of
the reasons why [the public lacks access]{.mark} to and understanding of
the criminal process [is]{.mark} [that defendants who plead
guilty]{.mark}---i.e., most defendants---[lack]{.mark} tools to access
governmental [info]{.mark}r- mation [about their]{.mark} own
[cases]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cases like Ruiz further handicap defen-
dants' ability to obtain informant-related discovery, in conjunction
with police and prosecutorial informant practices that evade
documentation and review, rendering the entire criminal process less
public. The move toward informant secrecy affects not only public access
to information but also other branches of government. When defendants
lack access to informant-related data, courts lose the ability to review
that information. The culture of nondisclosure affects legislative
access as well. For example, in the 2004 congressional report titled
"Everything Secret Degenerates: The FBI's Use of Murderers as
Informants," the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government
Reform documented its inquiry into the FBI's mishandling of its mafia
informants throughout the 1970s and 1980s. During that investigation,
the FBI and the U.S. De- partment of Justice used numerous mechanisms to
withhold information from the committee, to cover up wrongdoing by
government officials and their informants, and generally to stonewall
the investigative pro- cess. "Throughout the committee's investigation,"
the report complained, "it encountered an institutional reluctance to
accept oversight. Executive privilege was claimed over certain
documents, redactions were used in such a way that it was difficult to
understand the significance of informa- tion, and some categories of
documents that should have been turned over to Congress were
withheld."47 The committee concluded that one of the central harms
associated with FBI informant practices was the agen- cy's resistance to
public transparency and legislative oversight. V. Informants in the
Digital Age Modern information technology and the internet raise new and
dra- matic challenges for the ancient practice of using informants.
Courts are increasingly moving toward digitized dockets and public
records made accessible over the internet. While such records were
always technically available to the public, the ability to access them
easily, remotely, and for free raises new issues about confidentiality
and safety.48 At the same time, the deployment of informants through
social media makes pos- sible an enormous set of new privacy invasions,
even as those social media platforms have become sites for invidious new
forms of witness intimidation.49 Back in 2004, the website Whosarat.com
generated a national con- troversy over the tension between witness
intimidation and the com- peting need for public transparency. In
retrospect, Whosarat.com looks tame in comparison to today's social
media environment: the site collected and posted some public court
records and information about individuals who were allegedly cooperating
with the govern- ment. Whosarat triggered so much anxiety at the time
that the New York Times ran an editorial on the dilemma created by this
"one odious website": [We believe that transparency is **essential** to
a fair judicial system]{.underline} and it would be a mistake to
overreact to one odious Web site by pulling down plea agreements from
the Internet wholesale. But Whosarat.com should serve notice that a
different level of caution may be necessary in the wired age. In
selective cases, where the life of the witness may be in jeopardy,
courts should consider not putting the documents online.50 Today, anyone
can post a "snitch list" on Facebook or Twitter, and the internet is
awash with information about alleged cooperators. Sometimes the lists
and documents are fake, sometimes the informa- tion is real.51 With the
easy sharing of case information on social media, it is increasingly
difficult for the legal system to meaningfully control or protect its
own records; this difficulty is in addition to the omnipresent risk that
court and law enforcement data might be hacked.52 Put differ- ently, in
much the same way that we individuals are losing our ability to maintain
our privacy and protect our information against new surveil- lance
technologies, so are courts. These difficulties have not stopped the
court system from trying. In November 2006, the U.S. Judicial Conference
sent a memorandum to the entire federal bench, recommending "that judges
consider sealing documents or hearing transcripts . . . in cases that
involve sensitive in- formation or in cases in which incorrect
inferences may be made."53 In its report on public access to electronic
case files, the Judicial Confer- ence recommended against making
criminal court records electroni- cally available to the public
primarily because of the risk of exposing informants. Specifically, the
conference reasoned as follows: Routine public remote electronic access
to documents in criminal case files would allow defendants and others
easy access to information regarding the cooperation and other
activities of defendants. Specifi- cally, an individual could access
documents filed in conjunction with a motion by the government for
downward departure for substantial assistance and learn details of a
defendant's involvement in the gov- ernment's case. Such information
could then be very easily used to intimidate, harass and possibly harm
victims, defendants and their families.54 A decade later, a committee of
the Judicial Conference again rec- ommended greater use of sealing to
shield all plea agreements and sentencing information from the public.
Defense attorneys worried that universal sealing would perversely make
every defendant look like a snitch: sealing "will multiply the number of
inmates at risk exponen- tially without protecting anyone," said one
chief federal public defender. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press pointed out that "[depriving the public of this information in
all cases will prevent the pub- lic from ever knowing the reasons that a
criminal defendant received the sentence he or she
received]{.underline}. [That is completely **antithetical** to the idea
of a **transparent** criminal justice system]{.underline}."55 The
challenge is bigger than any case-specific inquiry into whether it might
be dangerous to reveal an informant's name or whether a par- ticular
investigation might be compromised by such revelations. Rather, the
legal system is grappling with disruptive changes in technology and
informational access in the face of our nation's historic commitment to
the public adjudication of crime. In the name of witness protection,
[courts are moving toward wholesale policies of hiding cases, dockets,
and practices]{.underline}, even in the face of increasing technological
access. This trend stands in stark contrast with Justice Kennedy's
classic constitu- tional analysis, in which he explained that the
judicial presumption of openness must be outweighed by specific reasons
for closure on a case- by-case basis. Today, the potential threat to
some witnesses is seen by many courts as a reason to overcome the
presumption of openness for all criminal records. Taken together, in all
of these many ways, the official practice of using informants undermines
public transparency throughout the criminal system. [[By resolving
liability in secret]{.mark}, [it **insulates** investigative and pros-
ecutorial techniques from]{.mark} judicial and legislative
[scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This reduced public access affects
numerous other constituencies, making it more dif- ficult for the press,
crime victims, families, and policy analysts to obtain
information]{.underline} about the workings of the justice system or
about specific criminal cases. Informant use has thus become a powerful
and destruc- tive informational policy in its own right, [reducing
public transparency and **obscuring** the real impact of criminal
practices on individuals, com- munities, and other
institutions]{.underline}. 6 The Community Cost I

4 Beyond Unreliable In the 25 years I have been in this business, I have
worked with hundreds of informants. I believe that exactly one of them
was completely truthful, and there is no way to be 100% sure about him.
--- John Madinger, senior special IRS agent and former nar- cotics
agent1 All [too often, the U.S. criminal system convicts the
innocent]{.underline}. The now- steady stream of exonerations is stark
[evidence that]{.underline}, even [in the most serious cases, innocent
defendants may still plead guilty]{.underline} or be convicted at trial
despite the existence of some of the most elaborate procedural
protections in the world.2 The sources of this disaster are complex: an
overwhelmed public defender system, long sentences, high trial convic-
tion rates, and [[systemic pressures that steer defendants into guilty
pleas]{.mark} are]{.underline} just some of the [reasons why
innocent]{.underline} [defendants]{.underline} may [dread]{.underline}
their day in [court]{.underline}. Criminal informants are an important
piece of the wrongful convic- tion puzzle. This is not merely because
they often lie. After all, any wit- ness is potentially unreliable. It
is rather because [informants have such **predictable** and **powerful**
inducements to lie, because law enforcement relies heavily on their
information, and [because the system is not well designed to
check]{.mark} that [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}. As a result,
[[unreliable informant]{.mark} information permeates the
process]{.underline} in ways that [predictably [lead to]{.mark} bad
results such as [wrongful arrests, bad search warrants]{.mark}, and
[fabricated evi- dence as well as]{.mark}]{.underline} the ultimate
failure: [[wrongful conviction]{.underline}]{.mark}. I. Lying Informants
The groundbreaking book Actual Innocence estimated in 2000 that [**21
percent** of wrongful capital convictions are influenced by criminal
informant testimony]{.underline}.3 Four years later, a study by
[Northwestern]{.underline} Univer- sity Law School's Center on Wrongful
Convictions [traced **[45]{.mark}.9 [percent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
documented [wrongful capital convictions to false informant]{.mark}
[testimony]{.mark}, making "snitches [the **leading cause** of wrongful
convictions]{.mark} in U.S. capi- tal cases]{.underline}."4 Another
report that same year estimated that [**20 percent** of all California
wrongful convictions, capital or otherwise, resulted from false snitch
testimony]{.underline}.5 Today, the Innocence Project concludes that
nearly [**20 percent** of all DNA exoneration cases involve a lying
jailhouse snitch]{.underline}.6 According to the National Registry of
Exonerations, approxi- mately [**15 percent** of all wrongful murder
convictions involve a jailhouse informant, and **23 percent** of
wrongful capital convictions are due to jail- house
snitches]{.underline}.7 More generally, law professor Samuel Gross's
study on exonerations reports that nearly [[**50 percent** of wrongful
murder convic- tions involved]{.mark} [perjury by]{.mark} someone such
as [a "]{.mark}jailhouse [snitch]{.mark} or another witness [who]{.mark}
stood to [gain from the false testimony]{.mark}]{.underline}."8 The
informant tendency to lie is old and infamous. It led federal judge
Stephen S. Trott, himself a former prosecutor, to warn that "\[[[in-
formants']{.mark}\] [willingness to do anything
includes]{.mark}]{.underline} not only truthfully spilling the beans on
friends and relatives, but also [lying, committing [perjury]{.mark},
[manufacturing]{.mark} [ev]{.mark}idence, soliciting others to
corroborate their lies with more lies, [and]{.mark}
**[double-crossing]{.mark}** anyone with whom they come into contact,
including---and especially---[the prosecutor]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
drug addict can sell out his mother to get a deal, and burglars,
robbers, murderers and thieves are not far behind."9 Or as the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals once noted, "\[[i\]t is difficult to imagine a
greater motivation to lie than the inducement of a reduced
sentence]{.underline}."10 Because snitching has become so pervasive,
[the threat of perjured testimony goes beyond the problem of the
individual bad witness]{.underline}. In 2006, for example, a federal
jury wrongfully convicted Ann Colomb and her three sons for allegedly
running one of the largest crack co- caine operations in Louisiana. The
Colomb family served four months in prison awaiting sentencing before
all charges were dismissed. Their [wrongful convictions were based on
fabricated testimony obtained from a ring of jailhouse
[informants]{.mark} who **[bought and sold]{.mark}** [info]{.mark}rma-
tion about the Colomb family [in]{.mark}side the local federal
[prison]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The ring worked by selling prisoners
files of documents and photographs [that would permit them to fabricate
testimony]{.mark} in order [to reduce their]{.mark} own
[sentences]{.mark}]{.underline}. The government planned to use
thirty-one such informants against the Colombs. The scheme was revealed
when a disgruntled prisoner, Quinn Alex, gave \$2,200 to another
prisoner in order to get a file. When the file never came through, Alex
wrote an angry letter to the prosecutor demanding that the other
prisoner be charged with theft. The presiding judge, U.S. district judge
Tucker Melancon, told a journalist afterward: "It was like
revolving-door inmate testimony. The allegation was that [there was in
the federal justice system a network of folks trying to get relief from
long sentences by **ginning up** information on folks being tried in
drug cases]{.underline}. I'd heard about it before. But it all
culminated in the Colomb trial." Judge Melancon ordered the U.S.
Department of Justice to investigate.11 While all compensated criminal
informants pose the risk of fabrica- tion, jailhouse snitches are
particularly pernicious. In a jaw-dropping 1989 interview with 60
Minutes, jailhouse snitch and admitted perjurer Leslie Vernon White
described how he was able to obtain informa- tion about other prisoners
and fabricate their confessions, while him- self in prison, and trade
those fabrications for reduced sentences. The White scandal led to a
grand jury investigation into the use of jail- house snitches [in Los
Angeles]{.underline}, which [concluded not only that [jailhouse snitches
**routinely lied**]{.mark} but also that police and [prosecutors
knowingly relied on and exploited unreliable]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[informants]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 For example, the grand jury found
evidence that [police and prosecutors would purposely place suspects in
the "informant tank" at the jail, surrounded by snitches working with
the government]{.underline}, "[in the hope]{.underline} that one or more
of the [informants would 'come up with information' to strengthen the
case against the inmate]{.underline}."13 Twenty-five years later and
fifty miles south of L.A., Orange County was rocked by a massive
jailhouse informant scandal. For years, [[the]{.mark} sheriff 's
[department ran a secret]{.mark} jailhouse [informant program]{.mark},
[**violating** defendants' constitutional rights]{.mark}, paying violent
gang members, main- taining a secret database, and lying to courts about
it]{.underline}. The scheme un- raveled when an intrepid public defender
named Scott Sanders spent over a year fighting to get the secret
documents that would ultimately reveal the government's misconduct.14
The jailhouse snitch problem is a concentrated version of a more gen-
eral danger associated with criminal informant use, which is the threat
to innocent suspects who happen to be incarcerated, who have criminal
records, or who are otherwise associated with a criminal milieu such as
illegal drug use. [Innocent people with criminal associations are more
susceptible to informant targeting and conviction because law enforce-
ment and jurors alike are predisposed to believe in their
guilt]{.underline}. Incarcer- ated or recidivist suspects are thus
particularly vulnerable to wrongful conviction based on unreliable
snitch information because it is harder for them to defend against
informant lies.15 Of course, sometimes informants, even unreliable ones,
tell the truth. In other words, the problem is not that criminal
informants always lie. Rather, as we saw in the previous chapter, it can
be extremely hard to tell when they do and when they don't. And unlike
other kinds of witnesses, informants are deeply self-interested in their
false stories. Their ability to convince the government that their
information is true and valuable may mean the difference between their
own freedom and incarceration or even life and death.16 II. Law
Enforcement Dependence on Informants

#### Informants destroy due process -- informant dependency, confirmation bias, collaborating false testimony, and coverups

II\. Law Enforcement Dependence on Informants Despite their known
unreliability, law enforcement relies on informants, often heavily. This
is not only because police and prosecutors need infor- mation to make
cases but also because [law enforcement success is often measured in
terms of numbers of arrests and prosecutions, thereby put- ting pressure
on police and prosecutors to use the **cheapest** and **fastest**
methods rather than the most reliable]{.underline}. This is particularly
true [in drug enforcement, where the government has become profoundly
reliant on informants in conducting investigations, selecting targets,
making arrests, and obtaining convictions.]{.underline}17 Because [law
enforcement [officials]{.mark}]{.underline} need to create cases, they
[have incentives to believe informants when they offer information that
ap- pears valuable]{.underline}. These incentives grow stronger once
informants become trusted, cases are initiated, and the [official
becomes dependent]{.underline} on the informant for the success of the
case. This dependence can become so great that it creates a sort of per-
verse romance---"**[[fall]{.mark}ing [in love with your
rat]{.mark}]{.underline}**." A prosecutor explains the phenomenon: You
are not supposed to, of course. . . . But you spend time with this guy,
you get to know him and his family. You like him. . . . \[T\]he reality
is that [[the cooperator's]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation often [becomes
your mind set]{.mark}]{.underline}. . . . It's a phenomenon and the
danger is that because [[you feel]{.mark} all [warm and fuzzy]{.mark}
about your cooperator, [you]{.mark} come to [believe]{.mark} that [you
do not have to spend]{.mark} much [time or energy investigating the
case]{.mark} and you don't]{.underline}. [Once you be- come chummy with
your cooperator, there is a real danger that you **lose your
objectivity**]{.underline}.18 Another prosecutor describes how reliance
on a cooperator affects numerous crucial decisions down the line. [Once
the government believes an informant, it is a **certainty**]{.underline}
that the [info]{.underline}rmation obtained from the cooperator will
become part of the base of information utilized to evaluate future
would- be cooperators. Moreover, the information [will affect future
questioning of witnesses and defendants]{.underline}; it will alter how
investigators view [the signif- icance of witnesses and particular
pieces of evidence; and it may taint the way the case is perceived by
the prosecutors and agents]{.underline}. In other words, false
information skews the ongoing investigation. The false information may
prove critical to issues that have far greater import than whether to
accept as true the proffer of another would-be cooperator. Rather, [it
might impact decisions regarding charges to be filed against other
defen- dants, it might affect decisions related to an appropriate plea
for a given defendant, and it might even influence whether the
government decides to seek the death penalty]{.underline}.19 Studies
show that [police and prosecutors]{.underline}, like everyone else, tend
to interpret information in ways that [support]{.underline} their
previous decisions and resist interpretations that suggest they got it
wrong the first time around. Psychologists refer to this phenomenon as
"**[[confirmation]{.underline}]{.mark}**" or "expectancy"
**[[bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**, "belief perseverance," or "tunnel
vision." Law professor Daniel Medwed explains how [cognitive tunnel
vision [causes]{.mark} law enforce- ment [officials to stick to]{.mark}
[their original theories]{.mark} about who is guilty even in the face of
contradictory evidence]{.underline}. [[Tunnel
vision]{.underline}]{.mark} can also [[lead]{.underline}]{.mark} [[law
enforcement to selectively]{.mark} identify and [seek out evidence that
confirms their]{.mark} first [impressions]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 As a
result, once law enforcement officials accept informant information, it
becomes important for the government to preserve the credibility of that
information and that informant, even when other evidence suggests that
they may be unreliable.21 These psychological dynamics have troubling
legal implications. [The [Due Process]{.mark} Clause of the U.S.
Constitution [requires]{.mark} [prosecutors]{.mark} [to]{.mark} dis-
cover and [disclose]{.mark} to defendants [impeachment material
about]{.mark} govern- ment [witnesses]{.mark}]{.underline}, namely,
evidence suggesting that the witness might be lying.22 The adversarial
process depends on this disclosure to ensure that defendants can
meaningfully ferret out informant lies. [[But]{.mark} [police]{.mark}
and prosecutors [lack incentives]{.mark} to seek out such material, not
only [because it could]{.mark} literally [destroy their cases]{.mark}
but also because [they have **vested interests** in believing their
informants]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [police in possession of
impeachment material may be reluctant to share it with prosecutors,
knowing that it will have to be disclosed to the defense]{.underline}.
This means that [the u[sual protections against unreliable
witnesses---prosecutorial ethics and discovery]{.mark}--- [may be
unavailable]{.mark} precisely because prosecutors them- selves have
limited means and incentives to discover the truth]{.underline}.
Sometimes police and prosecutors are taken in by their own infor- mants.
For example, prosecutors believed Marion Albert Pruett's 1982 testimony
against a prisoner accused of killing Pruett's cellmate and put Pruett
into the federal witness protection program. Pruett subsequently
committed a string of bank robberies and murdered two convenience store
clerks and eventually confessed that he had killed his cellmate
himself.23 Sometimes [government officials lack information about the
risks that their source is lying]{.underline}. The Baltimore prosecutor
in Tony Williams's 2003 murder trial was unaware that the state's key
witness, a jailhouse snitch, was also on the Baltimore police payroll as
an informant.24 Sometimes [police **withhold information** about their
informants not only from prosecutors but also from their own police
supervisors]{.underline}. In 2009, the St. Louis Police Department
initiated an investigation into its own officers to determine whether
rank-and-file police were lying about their informants. Two officers,
for example, had claimed to have gotten tips from informers who turned
out to be dead or in jail at the time. The police union got a temporary
restraining order on behalf of the officers against their own
supervisors, arguing that disclosing informants' iden- tities to police
supervisors "would jeopardize informers' lives, \[police\] officers'
careers and public safety." A judge eventually sided with the department
and permitted the investigation to proceed.25 [Sometimes]{.underline}
**[prosecutorial ignorance is intentional]{.underline}**. Tom Goldstein
was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1980, spending twenty-four years
in prison on the basis of testimony from jailhouse snitch Edward Fink.
Although he lied about it at trial, Fink had received lenience for
numerous offenses by working as an informant for the local police de-
partment for many years. However, because the Los Angeles County
prosecutors' office lacked procedures to keep track of informants and
their deals, the prosecutor on Goldstein's case did not know Fink's his-
tory in that office and therefore never disclosed the information to the
defense.26 In its 1990 investigation of informant abuses, the Los
Angeles grand jury concluded that the Los Angeles District Attorney's
Office had intentionally decided not to keep track of its informants and
their unreliability. The reasons for this decision were twofold: because
"[the defense might discover information" if it were documented, and be-
cause "the Sheriff's Department might be deemed to be violating defen-
dants' rights to counsel" if full information about informant practices
was revealed]{.underline}.27 In other words, [[under pressure]{.mark} to
make cases and [to shield law]{.mark} [enforcement from
scrutiny]{.mark}, the [prosecutors']{.mark} office purposely [refrained
from learning about]{.mark} and documenting its own use of [unreli- able
snitches]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other situations, [officials may
ignore or even affirmatively [encour- age informant mendacity]{.mark},
[conceal]{.mark}ing informant [lies from]{.mark} [the defense]{.mark} as
well as the court in order to obtain convictions]{.underline}. For
example, prosecu- tors lied for twenty years about their key informant
witness, beginning with Delma Bank's 1980 murder trial all the way
through his appeal and state habeas petition. Informant Robert Farr had
set up Banks in ex- change for cash and lenience, a fact that the
government continuously denied.28 Similarly, James Walker spent nineteen
years in prison for a 1971 murder he did not commit, on the basis of
allegations of a criminal informant, John Snider. Although they had
proof that Snider was lying, police and prosecutors covered up his lies
and withheld evidence re- garding Snider from the court and from the
defense.29 In another case, [the Ninth Circuit threw out the death
penalty sentence]{.underline} imposed on Lacey Sivak
[because]{.underline} prosecutors withheld evidence that the informants
in the case were getting deals and because [prosecutors knew that the
informants were lying on the stand]{.underline}.30 Sometimes informant
use reflects deep institutional dysfunction of which unreliability is
just one aspect. Throughout the 1990s, Detroit homicide police ran an
illegal snitching operation on the ninth floor of the police department.
Informants received sentencing reductions in addition to food, drugs,
access to sex, and special privileges from de- tectives in exchange for
making statements against dozens of prisoners who were eventually
convicted of murder. [[Detectives]{.mark} actively [instructed
informants to fabricate testimony]{.mark}]{.underline}. One informant
reported that "detec- tives supplied him and other informants with
prewritten statements to memorize before the preliminary hearings of the
accused men. In those statements, [informants would say that the accused
person confessed to their crime in a way [that 'filled in']{.mark} the
[details detectives were missing]{.mark} to connect the suspect to their
crime]{.underline}."31 The snitch ring was an ill-kept secret. Indeed,
one Detroit prosecutor at the time complained about the practice to his
supervisors, writing that "promises of leniency are made to these
snitches without approval---or prior knowledge---which exceeds police
authority and violates our poli- cies." The prosecutor also knew about
the fabrications: "I have been told," he wrote, "that
[snitches]{.underline} do lie [about overhearing confessions and fabri-
cate admissions in order to obtain police favors or obtain the deals
they promised]{.underline}."32 The practice nevertheless continued,
resulting in dozens of convictions and, decades later, numerous
exonerations. These examples of official wrongdoing are not meant to
impugn the vast majority of police and prosecutors who do not engage in
such con- duct. But they do illustrate the dangers and temptations with
which police and prosecutors must contend. Informant witnesses represent
a kind of perfect storm: deeply unreliable sources managed by officials
with strong incentives to accept and defend their information. In these
ways, the interdependence of law enforcement and its informant wit-
nesses can threaten the entire fact-finding process. III. The
Corroboration Trap Sometimes a single informant provides the central or
only evidence in a case. Such scenarios are so obviously risky that a
number of states now require corroboration for informant testimony. But
corroboration is not foolproof. Sometimes [[informants]{.mark} are used
to [bolster]{.mark} [other]{.mark}, equally [unre- liable forensic
evidence]{.mark}, [which makes]{.mark} that [ev]{.mark}idence [look
stronger]{.mark} than it actually is]{.underline}. And [because
informants often **collude**]{.underline}, sometimes [[mul-
tiple]{.mark} [informants]{.mark} [will provide corroboration
for]{.mark} each [other's fabrications]{.mark}, making all their false
stories look more plausible than they actually are]{.underline}. In each
of these cases, informant evidence is corroborated but neverthe- less
still unreliable. In 2004, Texas executed Cameron Todd Willingham for
allegedly murdering his three children. Willingham maintained his
innocence throughout, turning down plea offers that would have saved his
life. His conviction and execution are now widely believed to have been
wrong- ful, based on discredited junk arson science. But Willingham was
not convicted solely on faulty forensics. Weeks after Willingham's high-
profile arrest, jailhouse informant Johnny Webb came forward and al-
leged that Willingham had confessed to him in the jail. Between the
arson claims and the jailhouse snitch, all doubt about Willingham's
guilt evaporated, even to his own lawyers. Years later, Webb---who was
diag- nosed as bipolar---recanted his testimony, admitting that the
prosecu- tor had offered him an undisclosed deal in exchange for his
testimony against Willingham.33 Other cases similarly demonstrate how
[jailhouse informant testimony can bolster bad forensics]{.underline}.
In Florida, at least three men were wrongfully convicted based on the
testimony of a fraudulent "dog sniff " expert who offered junk science
evidence of the men's alleged guilt. In all three tri- als the
government relied on jailhouse snitch testimony to reinforce the faulty
dog sniff evidence. The three men were eventually exonerated.34 And even
though bite mark evidence has been thoroughly discredited, David Spence
was convicted based on bite mark evidence and the testi- mony of six
jailhouse informants, two of whom later recanted. Spence was executed in
Texas in 1997.35 Put differently, bad informants can be used to
corroborate bad fo- rensics. The problem arises in part because
informant testimony is not independent evidence: informants may come
forward entrepreneurially to provide information about high-profile
cases in the media or about other people in the jail, while police and
prosecutors encourage and invite this entrepreneurship. In this way, the
very existence of a high- profile case or defendant can affirmatively
generate informant evidence. That evidence, in turn, is most valuable to
the government when the underlying case is already weak, which means
that the informant testi- mony is even more likely to distort the
outcome and lead to wrongful conviction. Corroboration is also
misleading when multiple informants offer the same story. In a typical
criminal case, the existence of multiple sources for the same evidence
tends to render that evidence more reli- able, in part on the assumption
that each piece of evidence has been independently generated. But
informants are known to proactively col- laborate and collude in order
to render their stories more plausible and thus more valuable to the
government. As one federal court of appeals explained, "[because they
are aware of the low value of their credibility, criminal\[\]
\[informants\] will even go so far as to create corroboration for their
lies by recruiting others into the plot]{.underline}."36 For example, in
Ann Colomb's wrongful conviction described above, the Louisiana pros-
ecutor planned to use thirty-one informants from the federal prison, all
of whom were part of a for-profit snitch ring in which each infor- mant
corroborated the same story. A comparable informant collusion scheme
operated for many years in the Atlanta jail. Prisoners bought and sold
"packages of information" to each other to be offered to the government
in exchange for leniency. Prices for information ran as high as
\$250,000, in a market that a federal judge excoriated as "abomi-
nable."37 In the 1989 Los Angeles grand jury investigation, informants
likewise reported that they shared information and tactics with each
other and collectively developed fabricated stories by repeatedly run-
ning those stories past law enforcement officials until they got the
desired response.38 [One]{.underline} experienced Los Angeles
[snitch]{.underline} [even wrote a "**manual** . . . instructing other
jailhouse snitches how to fabricate confessions]{.underline}."39 As a
result of these dynamics, the existence of multiple informants
presenting the same or similar evidence can itself, ironically, be a po-
tential indicator of unreliability. The California legislature has
formally recognized the high risk of jailhouse informant collusion by
barring the use of the uncorroborated testimony of an in-custody
informant. The law specifically forbids the use of another jailhouse
informant to serve as corroboration unless the government can prove that
the testifying informant has not communicated with other informants.40

II\. Using Informants as Investigative Tools For the government, the
central benefit of using informants is to obtain information.
[The]{.underline} U.S. [Constitution places significant limits on the
gov- ernment's ability to obtain and use incriminating
information]{.underline}. Under [the **Fourth Amendment**]{.underline},
for example, the government cannot engage in unreasonable searches and
seizures; the government must get a warrant for certain kinds of
searches; and the government needs a certain amount of
evidence---"reasonable suspicion" or "probable cause"---before police
can stop or arrest or otherwise deprive individuals of their liberty.
The **[Fifth Amendment]{.underline}** privilege against
self-incrimination, famously embodied in [**Miranda**
warnings]{.underline}, protects suspects against being pres- sured to
provide self-incriminating information. The **[Sixth
Amendment]{.underline}** right to counsel means that, once a defendant
has been charged with a crime, the government cannot question him or her
without the pres- ence of defense counsel.41 [Federal and state
law]{.underline} further regulates the government's ability to obtain
records or to deploy in private places bugs, wiretaps, video cameras,
and other types of surveillance.42 These rules, particularly those in
[the Bill of Rights]{.underline}, famously protect individuals against
official coercion and invasions of privacy. But the government's ability
to use [[informants]{.mark} is a powerful and often easy way to
**[circumvent]{.mark}** many of these
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Because]{.underline}
[constitutional re- straints]{.underline}]{.mark} [generally [apply
**only** to official actors]{.mark}, [a]{.mark} private individual
acting as an [informant can obtain info]{.mark}rmation that [the
government could not]{.mark} easily [obtain]{.mark} on its
own]{.underline}. Criminal [informants]{.underline} are thus potent
investiga- tive tools, not only because they can be effective
information gatherers but also because they [are]{.underline}
**[exempt]{.underline}** from many of [the rules that otherwise
constrain official investigative techniques]{.underline}. In 1966, the
Supreme Court decided that the governmental use of compensated criminal
informants is constitutionally permissible. That case---Hoffa v. United
States---upheld the government decision to use and reward Edward Partin,
a corrupt union official, to infiltrate the inner circle of Teamsters
president Jimmy Hoffa and to eavesdrop on Hoffa's conversations with his
associates and his attorney. The government recruited Partin out of a
Louisiana jail, where he was facing multiple serious state and federal
charges including manslaughter, kidnapping, embezzlement, and perjury.
Because Hoffa let Partin into his private hotel room unaware that Partin
was working for the government, [[the Court held]{.mark} that Hoffa had
assumed the risk that the informant would share the information he
learned and therefore that Hoffa's **[right to pri- vacy]{.mark}** under
the Fourth Amendment was not violated]{.underline}. As the Court put it,
"The risk of being overheard by an eavesdropper or betrayed by an
informer or deceived as to the identity of one with whom one deals is
probably inherent in the conditions of human society. It is the kind of
risk we necessarily assume whenever we speak."43 [The Court]{.underline}
also [decided]{.underline} that [the government's use of Partin to
obtain Hoffa's incriminating statements did not trigger Hoffa's Fifth
Amend- ment's protection again **[self-incrimination]{.mark}**, because
Hoffa was not of- ficially compelled to speak]{.underline}. In Illinois
v. Perkins, the Court went further, holding that [an incarcerated
suspect questioned by a jailhouse infor- mant at the government's
instigation did not have the right to be given **[Miranda]{.mark}**
warnings or to obtain **[counsel]{.mark}**, even though he would
have]{.underline} [if]{.underline} the exact same [questioning had
been]{.underline} [conducted]{.underline} openly [by
police]{.underline}. The Court reasoned that, [[because the defendant
did not know the snitch was]{.mark} acting as [a government
agent]{.mark}, he was not being coerced to confess in an impermissible
way]{.underline}.44 After Hoffa, the Supreme Court approved the
extension of informant use through technology. In United States v.
White, the Court held that the warrantless use of [[a "wired"
informant]{.underline}]{.mark}---i.e., an informant wearing a
transmitter permitting police to hear the conversation---[[did not
violate]{.mark} the defendant's Fourth Amendment [privacy
rights]{.mark}, even though one of the transmissions took place in his
home]{.underline}. In dissent, Justice Douglas worried that the Court
had missed the significance of the new tech- nological advances.
["Electronic surveillance]{.underline}," he wrote[, "is the greatest
**leveler** of human privacy ever known]{.underline}. . . . \[[M\]ust
everyone \[now\] live in fear that every word he speaks may be
transmitted or recorded and later repeated to the entire
world]{.underline}?" Also in dissent, Justice Harlan opined that "the
practice of third-party bugging, must, I think, be considered such as to
undermine that confidence and sense of security in dealing with one
another that is characteristic of individual relationships between
citizens in a free society."45 The convergence of
[informant]{.underline} use and new [tech]{.underline}nologies has
[opened]{.underline} [the door to]{.underline} even [more intrusive and
powerful]{.underline} forms of [surveillance]{.underline}. [Federal law
imposes significant restrictions on official use of electronic
surveillance, requiring police to obtain a court order before intercept-
ing communications]{.underline}. [A court may not]{.underline}
[approve]{.underline} a request for [electronic surveillance
unless]{.underline} it makes numerous findings, including a finding that
that [there is probable cause]{.underline} that a crime is being
committed and that "normal investigative procedures have been tried and
have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or
to be too danger- ous."46 But the federal electronic surveillance
statute, typically referred to as "Title III," contains an exception for
one-party consent: [[if an in- formant is party]{.mark} to the
communication and consents to the recording, [there is no need for court
authorization]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [while the gov-
ernment must get a court order before it can wiretap a phone or place a
camera in a private place]{.underline} such as a home or hotel room, [it
does not need a warrant to wire an informant to record communications or
videotape in those same private spaces]{.underline}.47 For example, in
United States v. Nerber, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the government could place a video camera in a hotel room with the
consent of the informants who were inside, although once the informants
left the room, it was no longer permissible to videotape the occupants
absent a warrant.48 Thirty-eight states follow Title III by authorizing
one-party consent to electronic surveillance. A few states, however,
have held that informant electronic surveillance in a person's home or
other private places re- quires more regulation. The West Virginia
Supreme Court has held that, in contrast to federal constitutional and
statutory law, the West Virginia Constitution prohibits wired informants
from videotaping or recording transactions in an individual's home
without a warrant.49 Similarly, the supreme courts of Montana, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Alaska, and Penn- sylvania have all held, under their
respective state constitutions, that wired informant surveillance in a
person's home requires a warrant.50 III. Defendant Rights against

H. Systemic Integrity and Trust The final set of implications associated
with informant use has to do with the perceived
[[legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark} of the criminal system itself. Law
enforce- ment [depends on the trust, acceptance, and
cooperation]{.underline} of the people and communities that it polices.
[[Without that]{.mark} trust and acceptance, [the]{.mark} **entire**
[system **breaks down**]{.mark}]{.underline}.112 [[Informant use
**erodes** public trust]{.underline}]{.mark} in the criminal system in
numerous ways that are explored throughout this book. For example, the
fact that [[more]{.mark} [culpable defendants]{.mark} routinely [receive
lesser sentences **undermines**]{.mark}]{.underline} the public sense of
the system's [[fairness]{.underline}]{.mark} and evenhandedness. [[The
de- terrent effect]{.mark} of the law [is eroded by the fact]{.mark}
that]{.underline}, as one court put it, "\[n\]ever has it been more true
than it is now that [a criminal]{.underline} charged with a serious
crime [understands that [a]{.mark} fast and [easy way out of
trouble]{.mark} with the law [is]{.mark} . . . [to cut a deal at someone
else's expense]{.mark}]{.underline}."113 That [[violent]{.mark} and
destructive [people]{.mark} may be permitted to [remain at large in
exchange for info]{.mark}rmation is frightening to the people who must
live with the con- sequences]{.underline}. The
[[secrecy]{.underline}]{.mark} [surrounding informant use
[exacerbates]{.mark} [all these problems]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**obscuring** the real costs and benefits of informant use and driving
a wedge between the law enforcement officials who use infor- mants
and]{.underline} members of [the public]{.underline} who are supposed to
be the ultimate beneficiaries of the practice.114 Finally, the tragedy
of Princess Hansen's death reveals another kind of destructiveness: the
fourteen-year-old's jaded understanding that [**[jus- tice is for
sale]{.mark}** and that if she cooperated with criminals she would be
paid]{.underline}---[in]{.underline} precisely [the same way that police
pay criminals for their coop- eration]{.underline}. A car wash attendant
in Los Angeles likewise once explained to me that, in his old
neighborhood (which he declined to identify), "three will set you free."
The adage referred to the widespread understanding that if you were
charged with a felony but gave the government informa- tion about three
other people, they would let you go. In all these ways, informant use
inflicts significant wounds on the integrity of the criminal process,
even as it contributes to the law en- forcement project in unique ways.
The remainder of this book explores this conundrum. 2. Informant Law

#### Coercion in plea bargaining encourages falsely snitching on innocents to get a better deal for yourself

CONCLUSION [[Coercive plea bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark} is a threat
to the legitimacy of the criminal justice system because it [[encourages
defendants to falsely condemn]{.mark} themselves and, sometimes, even
[other innocent people]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Bargained
justice]{.mark}** calls into question the fairness and accuracy of plea
resolutions. When defendants falsely plead guilty to crimes they did not
commit, there are a number of potential victims. The defendant, of
course, is victimized by a system that coerces innocent people to plead
guilty]{.underline}. But when the system gets it wrong, [it]{.underline}
also [[risks **retraumatizing** the victims of the true perpetrator and
creating new victims who are injured when the actual wrongdoer is free
to harm again]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, [defendants often plead
guilty to seemingly favorable plea deals in exchange for testimony
against others]{.underline}. As research demonstrates, [[even innocent
people who falsely plead guilty are susceptible to condemning other
innocents to secure the best plea deal]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Those
[additional]{.mark} [innocent parties]{.mark} also [become victims of
coercive bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}. By linking the research on
coercive bargaining to these potential categories of victims, this
Article, the first of two in this series, unearths a further need for
plea reform. The reforms outlined here are the beginning of a process
that limits coercive bargaining and its victims

Amendment Limitations on the Police-Informant Relationship," Santa Clara

A. Law Enforcement Concerns Police and prosecutors generally, and
particularly those who work in areas, like narcotics, that are highly
dependent on informants, will have the most forceful concerns about
recognizing a constitutional prohibition on the use of coerced
informants.27 7 Much of this criticism likely will have a practical
bent: [if effective law enforcement requires the use of informants, then
[a constitutional limitation]{.mark} on the use of informants presumably
[will **hamstring** the]{.mark} [investigation]{.mark} and prosecution
of these crimes]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} most direct and
principled [response to [these concerns]{.mark} is simply that they
[are]{.mark} **[irrelevant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many [constitutional
provisions make police work more difficult]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} such
[difficulties are]{.mark} oftentimes **[intentional]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} even when merely incidental [**do not** justify ignoring
the Constitution]{.mark}\'s plain language]{.underline}. As the Supreme
Court has recognized in the Fourth Amendment context, \"[[the]{.mark}
[forefathers]{.mark}, after consulting the lessons of history, [designed
our Constitution to place **obstacles** in the way of]{.mark} a too
permeating [police]{.mark} surveillance, which they seemed to think was
[a greater danger to a free people than the escape of some criminals
from punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"2 7 Similar reasoning applies
here: Congress drafted and passed, and the States ratified, a sweeping
ban on slavery and involuntary servitude on the belief that these
conditions are offensive to a free society and interfere with the
natural rights of the citizenry.2 79 [[This]{.mark} ban [cannot be
ignored simply because it is inconvenient]{.mark}]{.underline}. That
being said, on the few occasions that coerced informants have raised
Thirteenth Amendment arguments, courts have dismissed them with little
analysis, suggesting that perceived practical concerns may prevent their
serious consideration.2 8 ° Also, despite its occasional sweeping
declarations to the contrary, the Court does weigh practical
considerations when considering the scope of some constitutional
protections, such as the due process clause,2 8 \' or remedies for
constitutional violations, such as the exclusion of evidence obtained in
violation of the Fourth Amendment.2 2 Thus, a robust argument for the
application of the Thirteenth Amendment in the informant context
requires a response to likely law enforcement concerns. First and
foremost, the Thirteenth Amendment leaves police and prosecutors with
options other than threatening criminal prosecution: they may encourage
cooperation with inducements other than leniency, offer leniency in
exchange for the provision of previously-obtained information, or compel
active cooperation from convicts. 83 All of these alternatives are
subject to criticism, however, because they are potentially less
efficient or efficacious ways of obtaining cooperation than threatening
a potential informant with prison time.2 u Moreover, an informant who
only provides previously obtained information is less useful, because
the police cannot use the informant to investigate specific individuals
or crimes, and to obtain physical evidence that can be used to secure a
conviction or convince another defendant to cooperate. Finally, a
convicted criminal will be an ineffective active informant unless the
informant\'s conviction and the terms of her sentence can be protected
from public disclosure; otherwise, the informant would easily be
discovered, criminals would refuse to interact with her, and she may be
in physical danger.2 5 In large part, these concerns only underscore why
the use of coerced informants violates the Thirteenth Amendment. The
Amendment prohibits using the threat of criminal sanctions to compel
labor precisely because [the threat is so powerful that [it prevents the
laborer from choosing not to work]{.mark} or from rejecting oppressive
or dangerous conditions]{.underline}. 86 Thus, [when police direct a
coerced informant\'s investigation]{.underline}, they can involve an
informant like Rachel Hoffman in more dangerous criminal activity than
the informant has the training or ability to handle, and the informant
cannot refuse.2\" 7 [[It is this **lack** of a real choice that renders
the condition of servitude offensive]{.mark} to a free
society]{.underline}.28 8 The safety and efficacy concerns that require
that an informant\'s identity be kept secret are different, however,
because they are independent of the underlying rationale for the
Thirteenth Amendment. Nevertheless, the interests that counsel in favor
of secrecy are counterbalanced by constitutional arguments in favor of
requiring that criminal records remain public.25 9 While the ultimate
resolution of these opposing concerns is beyond the scope of this
article, experience shows that it is impracticable to protect the
identity of convicts who become active informants. The Federal Judicial
Conference recommends that access to sealed documents, such as plea
agreements involving cooperation, be prohibited. 2 0 Additionally,
informant plea agreements and sentencing records are routinely sealed to
protect informants and policing efforts.291 B. Defense Concerns
Criticism by those on the defense side of the aisle is likely to involve
two issues: first, that forbidding cooperation in exchange for leniency
interferes with a defendant\'s autonomy; and second, that forbidding the
use of coerced informants will result in defendants receiving more
prison time. The first concern is merely a reiteration of the argument
that an individual\'s agreement to become a coerced informant exempts
the arrangement from the Thirteenth Amendment scrutiny, but from a
defense perspective. As explained previously, [[the]{.mark}
**[Thirteenth Amendment]{.mark}** [cannot be waived]{.mark} by an
individual because it protects societal interests in addition to
individual rights,]{.underline} and thus [the use of [coerced informants
cannot be defended on the ground that informants]{.mark} themselves
[have a right to choose]{.mark} to enter into a condition of involuntary
servitude]{.underline}.2 92 Second, forbidding the use of coerced
informants is likely to result in at least a temporary lengthening of
sentences and increased rate of incarceration. It is unlikely, given the
importance of informants to law enforcement, that a more formalized
process that involves conviction, sentencing, and a motion for leniency
will prevent those with the most to offer from negotiating arrangements
with police and prosecutors. But individuals who have less to offer will
not receive leniency and will be subject to prosecution and punishment
for their crimes. For the reasons explained infra, the more accurate
correlation between the committed and the sentences received that would
result would be a net positive from a larger societal standpoint.293
Additionally, forcing negotiations between defendants and the state to
take place in the context of a formal proceeding will put defense
counsel in a position to better protect their clients\' interests.
First, many coerced informants agree to cooperate with the police or
prosecutors without the advice of counsel, who could explain to their
clients the charges at issue, the sentences that they might receive, and
their chances of success at trial.2 94 A prohibition on agreements that
exchange leniency for active cooperation prior to a conviction will
guarantee that the informant will have access to counsel, thus allowing
informants to negotiate a fairer arrangement based on their actual
criminal liability and a realistic assessment of the sentence they would
likely receive. Moreover, the participation of defense counsel and the
involvement of the court can guarantee that the obligations of both the
informant and the government are clearly defined, set forth in their
entirety, and enforceable. 295 Also, because any agreement will most
likely be folded into a plea bargain, the defendant will be entitled to
the procedural protections that attach thereto, including a colloquy
with the judge to ensure that the defendant\'s plea is knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary. 296 Finally, these procedural protections
and the involvement of counsel will minimize the risk that the police
will be able to coerce an innocent individual into becoming an active
informant through unsubstantiated threats of criminal charges. 297 VI.
THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT IN A LARGER POLICY CONTEXT

#### Rigorous studies prove even innocent plea bargainers will lie to convict others in order to get a better deal -- the prosecutors incentivize mass deception, even by the innocent, to secure the convictions of other innocents. Reject all informants solve crime arguments; experiments prove even the innocent will condemn other innocents via false testimony

II\. **[FALSE TESTIMONY IN RETURN FOR FALSE BARGAINS]{.underline}** In
May 1979, Eva Gail Patterson was raped and murdered in her home in
Hattiesburg, Mississippi.145 Ms. Patterson's four-year-old son witnessed
the attack and later described the perpetrator to police as a single
"bad boy."146 The first suspect identified in the case was Larry Ruffin,
a teenager at the time.147 While Mr. Ruffin had a prior record for
stealing some beer and was on leave from a halfway house for that
offense at the time of the attack on Ms. Patterson, it is unclear why he
was targeted by police, as there were no witnesses or evidence linking
him to the crime.148 Nevertheless, [police brought]{.underline} Mr.
[Ruffin in for questioning]{.underline} and, according to a federal
lawsuit later filed in the matter, [beat and coerced him into confessing
to the heinous crime]{.underline}.149 As might be expected, Mr. [Ruffin
recanted his forced confession and proceeded to trial]{.underline}.150
Sixteen months later, as prosecutors prepared for Mr. Ruffin's trial,
police decided to interrogate Bobby Ray Dixon and Phillip Bivens.151 Mr.
Dixon had been in the same halfway house around the same time as Mr.
Ruffin.152 As before, [coercive interrogation tactics]{.underline},
[including "racially-charged threats and violence," were used to coerce
confessions from the men]{.underline}.153 Eventually, [threatened with
the death penalty if they failed to cooperate]{.underline}, Mr. [Dixon
and]{.underline} Mr. [Bivens pleaded guilty to the rape and murder
of]{.underline} Ms. Patterson [and testified against]{.underline} Mr.
[Ruffin]{.underline} at his trial.154 Mr. [Ruffin]{.underline}, [based
entirely on his confession and the testimony of]{.underline} Mr. [Dixon
and]{.underline} Mr. [Bivens]{.underline}, [was]{.underline} [convicted
and sentenced to life in prison]{.underline}.155 In 2010, DNA testing of
semen from the victim's body revealed that [the actual
assailant]{.underline} in the 1979 attack [was]{.underline} Andrew
[Harris]{.underline}; Mr. Ruffin, Mr. Dixon, and Mr. Bivens were all
excluded as sources of the sample.156 As a result of the new evidence,
Mr. Ruffin, Mr. Dixon, and Mr. Bivens were all exonerated.157 However,
the physical and mental injury resulting from years of incarceration for
crimes they had not committed took a heavy toll. Mr. Ruffin never saw
the day of his exoneration. He died in prison in 2002, still professing
his innocence and not knowing that the truth would one day come to
light.158 Mr. Dixon died in 2010, the same year as his exoneration.159
Mr. Bivens died in 2014.160 The three men did not even live long enough
to receive compensation for their wrongful imprisonment.161 The state of
Mississippi provided their estates \$50,000 in 2015, the equivalent of
\$1,612 per year or \$4.41 per day for their mistreatment.162 A multi-
million-dollar settlement in a federal lawsuit would not come until
2016.163 It was not difficult for law enforcement to track down Andrew
Harris, the actual attacker in the 1979 case, because he was already in
prison for another rape.164 Mr. Harris had lived close to Ms. Patterson
in 1979 when the initial crime occurred, but police had not identified
him as a suspect.165 Instead, they focused on Mr. Ruffin and then closed
the investigation after coercing false pleas from Mr. Bivens and Mr.
Dixon.166 While authorities may have believed that the convictions of
Mr. Ruffin, Mr. Bivens, and Mr. Harris had confirmed their theory of the
case, the true perpetrator had actually been allowed to go free and
victimize others.167 In the case of Mr. Harris, he went on to perpetrate
at least one additional rape, though there were likely additional
victims since he was able to remain free for a substantial period of
time following the rape and killing of Ms. Patterson.168 As the judge
noted when exonerating Mr. Dixon and Mr. Bivens, "'\[t\]he common thread
in this case is tragedy.'"169 Mr. Ruffin, Mr. Dixon, and Mr. Bivens were
each victims of [the [plea bargaining]{.mark} system]{.underline}; a
system that [[**coerced** innocent defendants to falsely plead
guilty]{.mark} and a system that then [incentivized]{.mark} innocent
defendants [to]{.mark} **[falsely testify]{.mark}** at trial in return
for the benefits of their bargains]{.underline}.170 Ms. Patterson also
suffered an injustice at the hands of plea bargaining, because [the
false pleas and false testimony in her case meant that the actual
perpetrator escaped justice for over **thirty years**]{.underline}.171
Importantly, the victims of Mr. Harris after 1979 were also victims of
the plea bargaining system, because [plea bargaining allowed prosecutors
to coerce false pleas to support a faulty case]{.underline}. And [with
those false pleas in hand, the system was able to close the
investigation while allowing the true perpetrator to go free and
**victimize again**]{.underline}. But how likely is it that someone such
as Mr. Dixon or Mr. Bivens might falsely plead guilty and then go on to
falsely testify at trial against another innocent person they had never
even met before?172 As noted in the previous Part, there are various
forces, including [sentencing differentials, advice of counsel, and
pretrial detention, that can lead to false guilty pleas]{.underline}.173
The additional phenomenon of offering false testimony and the
relationship between this behavior and plea bargaining raises further
questions Significant research has been conducted during the last decade
on offering false testimony at trial.174 In particular, there has been
much focus on informants, including jailhouse informants and accomplice
[informants]{.underline}.175 In fact, these types of [false testimony
account for **seventeen to twenty-one percent** of all exonerations by
DNA testing]{.underline}, and the research on this type of testimony
raises serious concerns regarding reliability.176 Jailhouse informants
are individuals who offer to testify about information learned from
fellow inmates, often alleged confessions that provide strong evidence
of culpability.177 In a 2007 article, Myrna Raeder discussed the danger
of using information from jailhouse [[informants]{.underline}]{.mark},
noting that they "claim no insider knowledge of the crime; rather,
[their [ticket to freedom]{.mark} or other rewards [is based]{.mark}
entirely [on]{.mark} the alleged confessions made to them by defendants,
which]{.underline} in an information-friendly world [may be spun from
whole cloth]{.underline}."178 Joy, in his article examining jailhouse
informants, chose to not even call these witnesses "informants."179
Instead, he called them "snitches" [because of the "high rate of
[unreliability]{.mark} of [uncorroborated]{.mark} jailhouse informant
[testimony]{.mark}]{.underline}."180 "[The untrustworthiness of such
witnesses is **well documented**]{.underline}," Joy noted, "and even
some prosecutors who use jailhouse informants refer to them as
'snitches.'"181 One judge stated of jailhouse informants: [[The **most
dangerous**]{.mark} [informer]{.mark} of all is the jailhouse snitch who
[claims another prisoner]{.mark} has [confessed to
him]{.mark}]{.underline}. The snitch now stands ready to testify in
return for some consideration in his own case. Sometimes these snitches
tell the truth, but more often [they **invent testimony**]{.underline}
[and stray details]{.underline} **[out of the air]{.underline}**.182
While this type of testimony is different from that offered in Mr.
Bivens's and Mr. Dixon's case, one must wonder whether it should be so
viewed. As noted by the judge above, jailhouse [informants' testimony is
questionable because [the statements are offered in return for a
benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}.183 The same can be said of the testimony
of Mr. Bivens and Mr. Dixon, though in the context of a formal plea
agreement.184 The term "accomplice informant" better describes the roles
taken by Mr. [Bivens and]{.underline} Mr. [Dixon]{.underline} in their
case. They [were alleged to have participated in the crime and received
a benefit for their assistance in testifying against those who did not
choose to plead guilty]{.underline}.185 While the use of jailhouse
informants comes with considerable skepticism today, [the use of
accomplice informants is a generally accepted practice in criminal
proceedings]{.underline}, and these witnesses tend to carry significant
weight with the jury.186 One court stated: [No practice is more
ingrained]{.underline} in our criminal justice system [than]{.underline}
the practice of the government [calling a witness who is an accessory to
the crime]{.underline} for which the defendant is charged [and having
that witness testify under a plea bargain that promises him a reduced
sentence]{.underline}.187 But that same court went on to state: [It is
difficult to imagine a greater motivation to lie than the inducement of
a reduced sentence]{.underline}, but courts uniformly hold that such a
witness may testify so long as the government's bargain with him is
fully ventilated so that the jury can evaluate his credibility.188
Nevertheless, while the use of accomplice informants is considered
commonplace, there is growing concern regarding the reliability of these
statements. Further, psychological research over the last decade has
begun to more deeply explore the prevalence of false confessions and
false implications of others in the context of accomplice informants and
jailhouse informants.189 In one series of studies, participants were
brought into a room in pairs.190 One individual was instructed to type
on a computer, and the other individual was instructed to read out what
was to be typed.191 The catch was that the typist was instructed not to
hit the "TAB" button because that would cause the computer to crash.192
As these studies were psychological deception studies, the computer
inevitably crashed even without the "TAB" key being struck to allow the
experiment to test how likely someone might be to falsely confess or
falsely implicate another in this situation.193 In one version of the
study, after the computer crashed, the readers were told that they would
not have to attend an additional typing session to make up for the lost
data if they implicated the typist.194 The study revealed that
[**[eighty-seven percent]{.mark}** of the readers [were prepared]{.mark}
to sign a statement falsely alleging that the typist had struck the
"TAB" key to secure this benefit]{.underline}.195 In another version of
the study, the researchers inserted a confederate as the typist and then
had the confederate deny the allegations that they had struck the "TAB"
key.196 In this scenario, the paradigm demonstrated that study
participants were less willing to falsely implicate the typist when the
typist denied engaging in the conduct.197 However, some [readers were
still willing [to falsely implicate the typist]{.mark} and those numbers
increased when an incentive was offered to make such a
statement]{.underline}.198 In another study by Robertson and Winkelman,
participants were given vignettes and asked to imagine themselves as an
individual charged with a crime.199 The subjects were then asked if they
would testify against another individual accused of murder.200 In one
version of the study, participants were told they would have to testify
that the other individual had admitted to the murder while in jail, but
they were also told that this had not actually happened.201 In return
for testifying, the participants were told that they would receive a
sentencing benefit in their own case.202 They were, in essence, serving
as the jailhouse informants described above.203 The study found that
only seven percent of those informed that the defendant had not made the
statement were willing to lie to receive the benefit.204 However, the
[[incentives]{.mark} did "[elicit false testimony in a]{.mark}
**[significant minority]{.mark}** of respondents]{.underline}."205
Further, "[the process of [wearing down a witness by]{.mark}
sequentially offering increasing levels of [incentives is]{.mark}
successful, nearly [**tripling** the rate of false
testimony]{.mark}]{.underline}."206 Despite the growth in research on
false informant testimony, psychological research had not, until
recently, explored the specific relationship between false guilty pleas
and false testimony by accomplice informants. However, new research
provides additional information regarding this type of defendant
decision-making. A pivotal moment in the expansion of research in this
area was the 2016 decision of the Japanese Diet (national legislature)
to allow plea bargaining for the first time.207 This new experiment with
plea bargaining in a country with no history of the practice opened up
opportunities for researchers to test some of the assumptions on which
American plea bargaining has been built. When plea bargaining finally
became lawful in Japan in 2018, the system that had been created was a
limited one compared to the breadth of its American counterpart.208 This
limited scope was due in part to concerns about false guilty pleas. The
new plea bargaining system only permitted agreements for certain types
of crimes involving group criminality, and even then, only in exchange
for the accused providing information about a crime committed by a third
party.209 The assumption underlying the structure was that while
defendants might be willing to falsely implicate themselves in return
for a bargain, people would not be willing to testify falsely against
other innocents in a formal proceeding to secure the benefits of those
bargains.210 In 2016, the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership
provided researchers a grant to test whether this assumption was correct
and whether the requirement of providing testimony would prevent false
guilty pleas.211 The results of the study showed that the revised plea
system still had significant negative effects on the reliability of
guilty pleas.212 The new cheating paradigm study was once again built on
a methodology originally used to study false confessions.213 This time,
the study was run simultaneously in the United States, Japan, and South
Korea.214 While only the results from the United States will be
discussed for purposes of this piece, similar results were discovered in
each country where data was available.215 As in the 2013 study, the
methodology was employed "in a controlled laboratory setting, utilizing
college students as participants."216 Students were once again accused
of academic misconduct and offered a plea deal.217 Despite having many
similarities, the new study differed from the prior research in a number
of important ways.218 For example, the new paradigm included an
increased role for counsel and more consistent stigma consequences
regardless of whether one took the deal or proceeded to trial.219 The
new research also tested not only whether participants were willing to
confess to their own alleged conduct, but whether the participants were
also willing to indicate who instigated the cheating and whether the
participants were willing to provide evidence against the other student
at a formal hearing.220 The study began with participants agreeing to
participate in what they believed was a psychological inquiry, who were
divided into individual versus group problem-solving rooms.221 Each
participant was led, along with another "student," into a private room
where the test procedures were explained.222 Unbeknownst to the study
participant, the other "student" was a confederate working with the
research team.223 When the individual problems were distributed, the
research assistant stated: "Now I will hand out the individual problems,
remember that you are to work alone." In fact, in one half of the study
the confederate encouraged the participant to cheat and work together.
In half of the cases, the confederate asked the study participant for
assistance in answering the questions, a clear violation of the
instructions. First, the confederate asked the study participant: "What
did you get for No. 2?" If the study participant did not respond with
the answer, the confederate followed up by saying, "I think it is . . .
." If necessary, the confederate asked for assistance with additional
problems: "Did you get . . . for No. 3?" Those study participants who
acquiesced and offered assistance were placed in the "guilty condition,"
because they "cheated" by violating the research assistant's
instructions. In the other half of the cases, the confederate sat
quietly and did not ask the study participant for assistance. Absent
unprompted attempts to cheat initiated by the participant, those in this
scenario were placed in the "innocent condition," because they did not
"cheat" by violating the research assistant's instructions. After
completing the second set of logic problems, the research assistant, who
did not know whether cheating occurred, collected the logic problems and
asked that the students remain in the room while the problems were
graded. Approximately five minutes later, the research assistant
reentered the room and indicated there was a problem and asked to speak
to the students individually.224 After the students were separated, the
study participant was accused of academic misconduct and offered a
bargain.225 The first option for the student was to admit the
misconduct.226 The punishment for the offense was losing any promised
compensation or credit for participating in the study.227 The student
was also told that their academic advisor would be informed of the
misconduct, thus creating a sense of stigma as a consequence.228 This
result was created to mimic probation, where the defendant is able to
resolve the matter without incarceration, but the stigma of the
conviction remains. The second option for the student was to maintain
their innocence and proceed to a trial.229 The "trial" was described as
an academic review board.230 While the exact description of the academic
review board varied in each location in which the study was conducted to
conform with local custom and expectations, the general structure was
the same.231 The review board's structure was modeled after a jury trial
system, in which a panel or jury of faculty and staff would hear
evidence from both sides and determine whether misconduct had
occurred.232 The student was told they had the opportunity to be
represented by counsel, advocate for their position, and present
evidence in their defense.233 Regarding punishment, the student was
informed that if they were found to have engaged in misconduct by the
review board, they would lose their compensation and their advisor would
be informed.234 These were the same punishments as those attaching if a
plea had been entered. To reflect the concept of a "trial penalty,"
students were informed that one of two additional punishments would also
be imposed.235 Half of the students were told the additional
ramification was attendance at an ethics seminar, followed by a
pass/fail test on the material.236 The other half of the students were
told they would be required to attend the ethics seminar, pass the test,
and complete ten hours of community service.237 The reason for the two
varying punishments was to test whether increasing the punishment led to
higher rates of pleas by either the guilty or innocent students.238 In
each scenario, the seminar and/or community service was intended to
represent a deprivation of liberties similar to a sentence of
incarceration in the criminal justice system---a loss of time.239 Before
a student decided whether to accept the plea offer, two additional
pieces of information were shared with them. First, the student was
presented with a document from a "student advocate."240 The document
stated that the student was entitled to representation, reiterated their
right to "trial" before the review board, and provided contact
information should the student decide to proceed to the review board and
desire representation.241 While not as robust a form of representation
as found in the above-described Henderson and Levett study, this ensured
students knew their rights and recognized that representation was
available to them. Even this modicum of representation surpasses what
many receive in the actual criminal justice system.242 In a 2011 report
by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers ("NACDL"), case
analysis of misdemeanor courts in Florida revealed that [most defendants
do not have any access to counsel before deciding how to
proceed]{.underline}.243 [Unsurprisingly, in the NACDL study, most
people chose to plead guilty]{.underline}.244 Second, the student was
told that the majority of people who appear before the review board in
the past were convicted, though they were also informed that ten to
twenty percent of students were found not responsible.245 This was an
important element to add to the student's decision-making because
similar information is typically communicated to defendants in the
actual criminal justice system.246 The conviction rate communicated to
participants in this study was similar to or actually below the
approximations of actual convictions in the criminal justice systems of
the three countries where the study was conducted.247 For example,
recent research indicates that less than one percent of defendants in
the U.S. federal system are acquitted, which includes seventeen percent
of those who preceded to trial.248 In Japan and Korea, the conviction
rate at trial has historically exceeded ninety- nine percent.249 In the
2013 version of the cheating paradigm study, the participant was
permitted at this point to decide whether to accept the deal or proceed
to trial.250 In the new study methodology, there was an added
requirement to reflect the supposition that Japan had created a more
reliable plea bargaining system by requiring the defendant to agree to
testify against someone else to receive the benefits of the bargain.251
To capture and test this aspect of the 2016 Japanese law, two versions
of the study were conducted by the research teams.252 In the first
study, the participant at this point was presented with a sheet of paper
asking them to indicate who instigated the cheating.253 Participants
signed the completed form, which indicated that it was a binding
document.254 This aspect of the study was intended to test whether
innocent participants would be willing to continue when they were
required to do more than simply admit their own guilt.255 In the second
study, the requirements of the Japanese plea bargaining law were
followed more closely.256 The study script required the participant to
identify the party to whom they provided assistance or from whom they
received assistance.257 The participant was also asked to provide
information to the academic review board regarding the cheating
incident, thus recreating the Japanese legal requirement that defendants
be willing to testify against another person.258 This aspect of [the
study]{.underline} was intended to [test the willingness of innocent
participants to not only falsely plead guilty, but also falsely testify
against another person they knew to be innocent at a formal
proceeding]{.underline}.259 In the United States, 204 individuals
participated in the first experiment.260 Of that number, 51.9% pleaded
guilty to cheating and 48.1% rejected the offer and elected to proceed
to the academic review board.261 As found in other studies, guilt was a
strong predictor of whether one would plead or proceed to the academic
review board.262 While the study attempted to identify the impact of
sentencing differentials on plea rates, there were no statistically
significant differences in plea choice between those participants
presented with the more lenient punishment before the review board and
those presented with the harsher punishment before the review board.263
For students facing the harsh punishment, the plea rates were 73.1% for
the "guilty" and 45.9% for the "innocent."264 In the more lenient
condition, the plea rates were 72.4% for the "guilty" and forty percent
for the "innocent."265 Both versions of the study strongly indicate that
Japan's attempt at creating a more reliable system may have succeeded in
modestly reducing false pleas, but a significant innocence problem will
persist. In the first version of the study, in which participants were
required to indicate on a sheet of paper who instigated the cheating,
seventy-three of ninety-four participants who pleaded guilty were
willing to sign the "instigator" sheet.266 Of those who had engaged in
the conduct, 81.3% correctly identified the confederate as the
individual who instigated the cheating.267 [[Of those]{.mark} who had
not engaged in the conduct and were "[innocent]{.mark}]{.underline},"
[**[58]{.mark}.6[%]{.mark}** [said]{.mark} [the confederate]{.mark} had
[instigated]{.mark} the [cheating]{.mark}]{.underline}.268 Importantly,
[[these]{.mark} were [individuals]{.mark} who [knew **no cheating had**
**occurred**]{.mark}, [yet]{.mark} were willing to [both]{.mark}
[falsely plead guilty]{.mark} to such an offense [and say]{.mark} that
[another innocent was responsible]{.mark} for the
behavior]{.underline}.269 In this study, therefore, it is probable [that
the plea bargain offered lead to misinformation that pointed to an
innocent person]{.underline}.270 In the second version of the study, in
which participants were required to implicate the other student and
offer evidence at the review board, an additional 133 students
participated.271 Again, [the results from the study in the United States
showed significant rates of guilty pleas and of innocent students
pleading guilty]{.underline}.272 The overall plea rate was 67.8%.273 As
in the first version of the study, more "guilty" participants accepted
the offer than "innocent" participants.274 Nevertheless, [65.8% of the
participants who had not engaged in cheating falsely pleaded
guilty]{.underline}.275 Of those who had actually offered improper
assistance to the confederate, [66.7% took the blame for the conduct on
the "instigator" sheet]{.underline}.276 [[**Every** single participant
who had not engaged in any cheating and decided to falsely plead
guilty]{.mark} [was]{.mark} also [willing to provide]{.mark}
[info]{.mark}rmation to secure the deal]{.underline}.277 [Of those who
falsely pleaded guilty, **[fifty-two percent]{.mark}** [stated]{.mark}
that [the confederate]{.mark} was the one who [instigated]{.mark} the
[cheating]{.mark}]{.underline}.278 Further, [eighty-eight percent were
willing to testify before the review board that cheating
occurred]{.underline}.279 The requirement that one implicate an innocent
person in wrongdoing and even offer testimony against that innocent
person in a formal proceeding caused a few people to pause, but only a
very small few.280 [For the vast majority of participants, [once a
decision had been made to falsely plead guilty]{.mark} for the benefits
of the bargain, [they were willing]{.mark} [to **say what was
necessary**]{.mark} to secure those benefits even if that meant standing
before a jury and lying about what had occurred]{.underline}.281 And
there was something more. [Recall above that the plea rate in the second
study was 67.8% overall and 65.8% for the "innocent"
participants]{.underline}.282 This means that "[[guilt" was not a
significant predictor of plea acceptance]{.underline}]{.mark} as it had
been in the first version of this study and in other previous
studies.283 While it is not clear yet why this occurred, it may be that
the added requirement of cooperating and agreeing to testify before the
review board added additional formality to the scenario.284 It is
possible that this additional step made the entire process seem more
daunting and, rather than reducing the prevalence of false pleas,
increased them because of a greater desire to resolve the matter
quickly.285 More research is necessary on this aspect of the study, but
the study opens the possibility that Japan's proposed solution to plea
bargaining's innocence problem may have actually exacerbated the
problem.286 With this and the previously discussed psychological
evidence in hand, the actions of Mr. Ruffin, Mr. Dixon, and Mr. Bivens
become less puzzling and more understandable given how the mind works in
such decision-making situations. As noted in the previous Part, people
want to secure a favorable resolution and move forward.287 In fact,
during debriefings conducted during the 2013 Edkins and Dervan
psychological study, participants noted two [common concerns that led
them to falsely plead guilty---a desire to move forward and a desire to
secure a punishment that minimized risk and did not require the loss of
a future liberty interest]{.underline}.288 [This is]{.underline} exactly
[what]{.underline} Mr. [Bivens and]{.underline} Mr. [Dixon
did]{.underline} in their situation.289 [They accepted a resolution that
carried finality and certainty, along with a significant
benefit]{.underline}.290 [When required to testify against another
person]{.underline}, someone Mr. [Dixon and]{.underline} Mr.
[Bivens]{.underline} had [never even met before trial, they did what
eighty-eight percent of the "innocent" participants in the new study did
and provided the information requested to secure their
deals]{.underline}.291 We conclude this Part by returning to the title
of this Article. It is clear that an innocent person who pleads guilty
is a victim of the plea process, or, more broadly, of the criminal
justice system. And yet, many debates about criminal justice see
defendants and victims of crime as operating in totally different
spaces; this is true for debates over plea bargaining, as well. Recent
victim-centered plea reform movements focus on the victims of crime who
are sometimes ignored or overlooked by the criminal system.292 Among
these movements is a push to ensure that prosecutors communicate their
case decision to the impacted victims.293 In a second Article that is
part two of this project, we look at how victims of crime may be
impacted by coercive plea practices.294 We focus on those victims who
believe they have received justice, only to learn later that an innocent
person pleaded guilty to the crime against them. We also focus in this
second piece on those individuals who are victimized when the actual
guilty party is able to go free and reoffend. All of this is to say that
attention should be paid to the impact of coercive plea practices on
victims of crime In this current Article, we want to frame the
defendants we discuss as victims of coercive bargaining as well. We are
certainly not the first to see defendants as victims. Indeed, there is a
rich literature that challenges the notion that defendants and victims
should be viewed as entirely separate entities.295 "Victim" is a term
fraught with many problematic connotations.296 As Aya Gruber has noted,
the term has typically "excluded marginalized men and women, often
defendants themselves."297 Instead, the "public face of 'the' victims'
rights movement \[has\] become that of a middle-class white woman."298
Further, as Miriam S. Gohara argues in recent work, "'victimization,' as
it is commonly understood in American legal culture, centers on
individual offenses inflicted by readily identified perpetrators,"
rather than "consideration\[s\] of structural oppression or contextual
harm."299 As such, Gohara explains that the term tends to focus us on
retribution against an individual, rather than structural reform of a
system.300 We acknowledge that "victim" is an imperfect word. And yet,
for all its problems, the term gives us a collective way to understand
that someone has been harmed. For this reason, we add here a
case-specific call to consider innocent defendants who falsely plead
guilty, and the people they may falsely condemn in the process, as a
type of victim of the criminal justice system. We think this is
important in explaining the type of harm they suffer and in making clear
the urgency of the need for reform. III. REFORMING COERCIVE PLEA
BARGAINING

#### Informants deals are plea bargains

II\. Plea Bargaining Approximately 95 percent of all criminal
convictions in the United States are the result of a guilty plea.21 This
means that trials and liti- gation are rare, while negotiated deals are
overwhelmingly the norm. This fact has implications for the transparency
of the criminal system. While trials and hearings are public, plea
bargaining is private. Litigated facts become part of the public record,
while negotiated facts remain off the record, known only to the
bargaining parties. The trend toward plea bargaining has thus been
accompanied by a trend toward the depublicization of the criminal
system. Information gathered by the government---and the investigative
methods used to get it---are increas- ingly difficult for the public to
learn about. Public information about the kinds of crimes that are
actually committed and by whom is like- wise disappearing, replaced by
information about the outcomes of deals struck between the government
and defendants. As criminal liability is increasingly resolved privately
through deals, the public loses sight of the way the system really
works. As federal judge Stephanos Bibas once wrote, inside players such
as prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges have quite a bit of
information about the way the system operates, but the public
experiences the criminal process as "opaque, tangled, insu- lated, and
impervious to outside scrutiny and change."22 [[The informant deal is an
extreme]{.underline}]{.mark} version of the guilty
[[plea]{.underline}]{.mark}, a kind of hyper-deregulated,
extra-secretive [[bargain]{.underline}]{.mark}. [An informant
deal]{.underline} resem- bles a plea in [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} it
[[resolves]{.mark} the informant's potential criminal
[liability]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least temporarily, [in exchange for
information]{.underline}. It is also like a plea bargain in that the
resolution of liability is negotiated and takes place in private between
the law enforcement official and the defendant or perhaps a defense
attorney. But informant deals are less regulated and more secretive than
plea bargains for a number of reasons. Unlike a plea, the deal may never
come to light at all. A typical informal agreement between a police of-
ficer and a street suspect---in which the suspect avoids arrest and the
officer obtains information---may never be written down or revealed to
anyone else. Whatever crimes the suspect committed may remain unknown to
the public, to prosecutors, and even to other members of the police
department. Even [if an informant is arrested, [their potential
liability may be]{.mark} han- dled in ways that [evade regulation,
documentation, or scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}. For ex- ample, in
United States v. White, police officer Mike Weaver searched Shawn
White's car and found a glass pipe containing what appeared to be
methamphetamines. Weaver offered White a deal. Before reading White his
Miranda rights, Weaver stated that he wanted to ask defendant some
questions and see how cooperative he would be that night. . . . Weaver
explained that if he sent the glass pipe to the crime lab and the lab
found methamphetamine residue, he could charge defendant with a felony
of possessing metham- phetamine. [Weaver said that the "deal" was that
he could write the police report to reflect]{.underline} a charge of
possessing drug paraphernalia, a misde- meanor, or possessing
methamphetamine, a felony. Weaver advised that depending on defendant's
level of cooperation, defendant could decide to "take the whole 100
yards, or deal with the small stuff." Weaver told defendant that he
could help in a lot of ways, or he could "sit there like a lump on a
log," which was not in his best interest. Weaver told defendant that [if
he did not cooperate]{.underline}, Weaver would simply list [charge
after charge]{.underline} and take defendant to the county jail.23
[White cooperated and, as promised, Officer Weaver wrote the report to
reflect only the possession of paraphernalia]{.underline}. [[The writing
of the police report]{.mark} in effect [constituted a plea
bargain]{.mark}, in which]{.underline} White's actual crimi- nal conduct
[was never fully recorded]{.underline}.
[[Prosecutors]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[alter criminal cases]{.mark}
and charges [to reflect]{.mark} a [de- fendant]{.mark}'s
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. [A prosecutor may decline to indict
on the un- derstanding that the informant will start "working off " her
charges]{.underline}. Charges may be dropped or reduced, and facts
pertaining to charges and sentencing---for example, the amount of drugs
at stake---may be negotiated between the parties so that the record will
reflect the agree- ment. In other words, [the court and the public will
eventually see only what the parties decide to reveal]{.underline}.
Finally, and of great importance, [the state can extract concessions in
an informant deal that it could not otherwise get through a criminal
sentence obtained via guilty plea]{.underline}. For example, [informants
can be re- quired to have sex, expose themselves to illegal drug use,
or]{.underline} even [risk their lives]{.underline} as part of a
cooperation deal---[requirements that no court could legally impose as
part of a formal sentence]{.underline}. To be sure, informant deals vary
immensely and take place along a spectrum of informality and secrecy. At
the most formal and transpar- ent end, a represented defendant will sit
down with his attorney and ne- gotiate a written agreement with the
government, with relatively precise terms of cooperation in exchange for
known benefits. Such deals are typical of white collar and political
corruption cases.24 The plea agree- ments entered into by Enron CFO
Andrew Fastow and by William "Rick" Singer in the college admissions
scandal are a matter of public record, as are the contours of each man's
cooperation, making it possible for the public to figure out what crimes
were forgiven and what benefits were exchanged.25 By contrast, at the
most secretive end of the spectrum, no one but the police officer and
suspect may ever know what crimes were committed and what information
was obtained. Because the bulk of informant use takes place in
street-level and drug enforcement, where investigations and deals tend
toward the informal, informant use as a whole tends toward the
secretive. In these ways, [pervasive [informant use exacerbates]{.mark}
the trend toward the **[secret adjudication]{.mark}** of crime and
punishment]{.underline}. [The greater the reli- ance on informant deals
rather than traditional plea bargains and trials, the less the public
learns about the crimes being committed and about how the criminal
system resolves liability]{.underline}. III. Discovery

#### Leniency towards informants encourages crimes -- it encourages crimes to fulfill arrest quotas, harms signaling effects of crime, and causes new crimes by active informants to go unpunished

B. Compromising the Purposes of Law Enforcement While using
[informants]{.underline} produces certain kinds of benefits, it also
threat- ens some of the very purposes of the law enforcement endeavor.
Most obviously, it [inherently involves the **toleration** of
crime]{.underline}. The practice of letting known criminal actors walk
away in exchange for information, and even facilitating their
criminality to enhance their informational value, flips the law
enforcement endeavor on its head. Numerous judi- cial cases and press
accounts reveal [[handlers]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[turn]{.mark}ed [a
**blind eye**]{.mark} [when their informants committed
**murder**]{.mark}, [extortion]{.mark}, fraud, money laundering,
bribery, [theft]{.mark}, tax evasion, fencing stolen goods, illegal
weapons possession, **[domestic violence]{.mark}**, [and **child
abuse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.51 The Depart- ment of Justice reports that
[[**10 percent** of]{.mark} the FBI's own [informant files
contain]{.mark} [ev]{.mark}idence that [the informant]{.mark} was
[commit]{.mark}ting [unauthorized crimes]{.mark} about [which the
government knew]{.mark}]{.underline}.52 Drug enforcement suffers from a
particularly strong version of this problem. Police, for example, give
thousands of dollars' worth of cash and drugs to informants who suffer
from substance use disorders, pur- portedly in the name of conducting
the "war on drugs." In 2008, Brook- lyn police officers were caught
paying informants with drugs taken from dealers who were arrested after
the informants pointed them out. One officer bragged about the practice
on tape, explaining that officers would seize drugs but report a lesser
amount, keeping the unreported drugs to give to informants later on.53 A
decade later, a police whistleblower re- corded fellow police engaging
in similar practices---including protecting and supporting drug dealers
who served as their informants---in Mount Vernon, New York.54 Some
[informants commit new crimes under cover of their informant
status]{.underline}. Tony [Warren]{.underline}, for example, started
[working as a Secret Service informant]{.underline} in 2001
investigating a Nigerian check-fraud scheme, after which he [started his
own check-fraud scheme involving the theft of hundreds of thousands of
dollars]{.underline}.55 Armando Garcia, already convicted once for
cocaine importation, was earning some extra money by help- ing the FBI
intercept 1,200 kilograms of cocaine headed for Florida in a submarine.
[Garcia used his relationships with the FBI and DEA to cloak his own
unauthorized]{.underline} 25-kilogram [cocaine deal]{.underline}.56
Sometimes [the lines blur between authorized and unauthorized in-
formant crimes]{.underline}. In 2004, police told Troy Smith that he
needed to pro- duce six arrests in order to escape charges himself. In
2005, Smith sold methamphetamines to another informant. When Smith was
charged as a dealer, he claimed that [[his handler]{.mark} had been
[**pressuring** him for a new arrest]{.mark} and that [he was]{.mark}
therefore [authorized to sell]{.mark} the [drugs in pursuit of his
quota]{.mark}]{.underline}. The court did not permit Smith to call the
police handler to the stand or to make the argument to the jury, and
Smith was con- victed and sentenced to thirteen years.57 Similarly, when
Ralph Abca- sis was charged with importing heroin, he asserted that his
New York drug enforcement handlers knew about and had implicitly
authorized the scheme, while the agents asserted that Abcasis had been
terminated as an informant prior to the heroin bust.58 In such cases,
whether new crimes have actually been authorized by the government is
often a mat- ter for debate and speculation. Using
[informants]{.underline} [alters]{.underline} other fundamental aspects
of the crimi- nal process, for example, [[the
principle]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [the worse the crime, the worse the
punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This foundational rule [is **routinely
flouted**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the world of
[snitching]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in the drug prosecution of
Ced- ric Robertson---Crips gang member, drug dealer, and paraplegic---
prosecutors also charged [[his]{.mark}
[g]{.mark}irl[f]{.mark}riend]{.underline}, Lakisha Murphy, as well as
four active gang members. Although the judge recognized that Mu[rphy was
not part of the gang or Robertson's drug business but was only mar-
ginally involved because she lived with]{.underline} and cared for
[her]{.underline} paraplegic [partner]{.underline}, [[Murphy]{.mark}
[received a]{.mark} mandatory [ten-year sentence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Because]{.mark} the]{.underline} four active [[gang members
cooperated]{.mark}]{.underline} against Robertson, [[they
received]{.mark} [lower sentences]{.mark} than Murphy did, even [though
their crimes were **far worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even the judge
complained of the disparity, telling Murphy that "it seems unfortunate
in this case that you're doing more time than some of these guys did . .
. and there's nothing I can do about it."59 Sometimes such disparities
have racial dimensions. In 1999, mafia hit man John Martorano agreed to
cooperate against his Boston mafia colleagues Whitey Bulger and Stephen
Flemmi. In exchange, he re- ceived a twelve-year prison sentence for the
twenty murders to which he admitted, in addition to extortion, money
laundering, and rack- eteering charges. African American leaders in
Boston complained that, even as federal prosecutors cut the deal with
cold-blooded killer Martorano, they were considering seeking the death
penalty against young Black local gang members accused of committing two
murders. "[[It fosters **distrust**]{.mark} in our criminal justice
system]{.underline}," asserted one Mas- sachusetts state representative.
"[[It]{.mark} [**mocks** the]{.mark} fundamental [principle]{.mark} that
[justice is]{.mark} blind and [evenly applied]{.mark}]{.underline}."60
More generally, studies have shown that federal [[Black and
Latinx]{.mark} [defendants]{.mark} who provide substan- tial assistance
[receive smaller sentencing reductions]{.mark} than do cooperat- ing
white defendants]{.underline}.61 Such cases reflect the more general
phenomenon that [snitching skews the system's evaluation of guilt and
innocence]{.underline}. As law professor William Stuntz put it
\[[[D\]efendants who have the most]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation to sell
[get the biggest dis- count]{.mark}]{.underline}. . . . [Trading **[plea
concessions]{.mark}** for information [means giving the big- gest breaks
to the **worst** actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. . . . \[W\]orse, . . .
\[i\]n order to make their threats credible, prosecutors must punish
defendants who fail to give them the information they want. . . . In [a
system]{.underline} (like ours) that [rewards]{.underline} [snitches
generously, some defendants will be punished very harshly--- nominally
for their crimes, but actually for not having the kind of infor- mation
one gets only by working at high levels of criminal
organizations]{.underline}.62 Or as federal district judge Roger Vinson
once mourned, "the problem . . . is that the [people who can offer the
most help to the government are the most culpable]{.underline}."63
[[This **shell game**]{.mark} of criminal liability [weakens the force
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the legisla- tive process. When legislatures
craft criminal laws, they define the con- duct for which liability will
attach and specify the range of punishment. The California robbery
statute, for example, defines "robbery" as "the felonious taking of
personal property in the possession of another, from his person or
immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force
or fear," and the statute sets specific sentences ranging between two
and nine years, depending on the nature of the underlying conduct.64
When legislatures define culpable conduct, and set the pun- ishment for
a particular crime at a higher level than for other offenses, this is [a
grave [societal statement]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} collectively
[consider]{.mark} such [con- duct]{.mark} to be
[worse]{.mark}]{.underline}.65 The ability of informants to escape
punishment for more serious be- havior erodes the force of these highly
specific legislative decisions. [In- stead, punishment turns on the
amorphous]{.underline} and sometimes momentary [decisions]{.underline}
of police and prosecutors [regarding the usefulness and conve- nience of
an informant]{.underline}, even when he or she may have committed acts
that the legislature has decided deserve substantial punishment.66 In
ef- fect, [[snitching is the **universal loophole** to]{.mark}
[every]{.mark} substantive criminal [law]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is as
if each code provision read: "[Here is the crime. Here is the
punishment. Unless you cooperate]{.underline}." C. Who's in Charge

#### Reliance on informants allows them to weaponize law enforcement to serve the informants' own goals

C. Who's in Charge around Here? "You're only as good as your informant,"
explained the police officers to the sociologist.67 "[[Informers are
running]{.mark}]{.underline} today's [drug
[investigations]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[not the
agents]{.underline}]{.mark}," complained a twelve-year veteran of the
DEA, "\[and\] [agents have become so **dependent** on informers that the
agents are at their mercy]{.underline}."68 Even
[prosecutors]{.underline} [worry]{.underline}: "These \[[drug\] cases
are **not**]{.underline} very well **[investigated]{.underline}**. . . .
\[O\]ur [cases are developed through cooperators and their recitation of
the facts]{.underline}. . . . Often, [in [DEA]{.mark}]{.underline}, [you
have]{.underline} little or **[no follow up]{.underline}** so when a
cooperator comes and begins to give you informa- tion outside of the
particular incident, [you have **no clue** if what he says is
true]{.underline}." Another prosecutor revealed that "the biggest
surprise is the amount of time you spend with criminals. You spend most
of your time with cooperators. It's bizarre."69 Particularly in drug
investigations, police and prosecutors rely heav- ily on informants to
make basic decisions about cases: Who should be investigated? What
should the charges be? Which accomplice should be the witness and which
one should be the defendant? Because crimi- nal informants are often key
sources of information, their choices about what to reveal or conceal
become crucial ingredients in the official decision-making process. As a
result, [government actors]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} all
too often [[**at the mercy** of]{.mark} their own [informants]{.mark}.
Heavy dependence on informants also displaces more independent
decisional processes]{.underline}: according to one former DEA and
customs agent, "[reliance on [informants]{.mark} has [replaced]{.mark}
good, solid police work like [under- cover]{.mark}
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [and surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}."70
[Prosecutors]{.underline} in Yaroshefsky's study [described]{.underline}
violent [gang cases as]{.underline} "all [based on
cooperators]{.underline} . . . \[and [evi- dence\] for which there is
only one rat after another]{.underline}."71 Another consequence of this
interdependence is to concentrate police attention on poor neighborhoods
of color from which drug informants tend to come. Relying on informants
naturally focuses attention on the people closest to those informants,
since snitches are unlikely to know people outside their own
socioeconomic group or community. As dis- cussed in more detail in
chapter 6, the use of snitches thus becomes a kind of focusing mechanism
on a community, guaranteeing that law enforcement will
disproportionately identify new targets there.72 Finally, [police and
prosecutors]{.underline} often inadvertently [validate the inter- ests
of their criminal informants]{.underline}. Law enforcement agents
universally recognize the danger that [[informants]{.mark} may be
[coop]{.mark}erating in order [to]{.mark} further their own aims: to
[eliminate competition]{.mark}, for example, or [take
revenge]{.mark}]{.underline}.73 When this happens, it means that [[the
state]{.mark} has effectively [placed its penal power]{.mark} [at the
disposal of criminal actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is deeply
problematic because [the integrity of law enforcement discretion turns
heavily on how the system selects within a nearly unlimited pool of po-
tential targets]{.underline}.74 Indeed, because the vast majority of
potential cases will never be pursued, it is the quintessential role of
police and prosecutors to choose which crimes will be addressed in ways
that validate broad public values of fairness and efficiency.75 [The
more police and prosecu- tors rely on informants in selecting targets,
the more the [integrity]{.mark} of the system [is
**compromised**]{.mark}]{.underline}. D. Mishandling and Corruption

#### Informants cause "official lawlessness" -- known murderers and rapists go off scot-free by lying in court, often convicting innocents, causing more crime

D. Mishandling and Corruption According to the DEA, "Failure in the
management of cooperating indi- viduals constitutes, perhaps, the most
obvious single cause of serious integrity problems in the DEA and other
law enforcement agencies."76 Former DEA agent Fitzgerald tells of
[one]{.underline} inexperienced [agent]{.underline} who [gave his
informant free rein to commit new crimes and who was so thoroughly at
the informant's mercy that the agent actually served as a lookout during
a burglary]{.underline}.77 The Office of the Inspector General for the
U.S. Department of Justice concluded in a 2016 audit that [the DEA
mishandled hundreds of its informants]{.underline}, including paying
unreliable and deactivated sources millions of dollars without tracking,
supervision, or documentation.78 [The FBI's use of [mafia
informants]{.mark}]{.underline} during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s
[[has]{.mark} been called "[one of the **greatest failures** in]{.mark}
the [history]{.mark} of federal law enforcement]{.underline}" by the
U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Gov- ernment Reform. Over the
course of those three decades, [the FBI "made a decision to use
murderers as informants]{.underline}. . . [. [Known killers were pro-
tected from]{.mark} the [consequences]{.mark} of their crimes and
purposefully kept on the streets]{.underline}."79 Perhaps the most
infamous incident of the era took place in the FBI's Boston office. For
twenty years, Agent John Connolly and a handful of others managed a
relationship with Irish mob hit men James "Whitey" Bulger and Stephen
"The Rifleman" Flemmi, who provided the Boston FBI with valuable
information about their rivals in the Italian mafia, La Cosa Nostra. As
part of that relationship, [Connolly protected Bulger and Flemmi
from]{.underline} discovery and [prosecution for]{.underline} their
[racketeer- ing activities, extortion, and the **murder**
of]{.underline} at least [**nineteen** people]{.underline}. Connolly
lied to prosecutors and other FBI agents in order to protect his
sources. In order to protect their informants,
[[FBI]{.underline}]{.mark} agents also [[permitted]{.mark} four
[**innocent** men to]{.mark} be convicted of murder and to [serve
**decades**]{.mark} in prison]{.underline}, a violation of law for
which, in 2007, the FBI was ordered to pay a judgment of \$101
million.80 Connolly is currently serving a forty-year sentence. Flemmi,
now eighty-eight years old, is serving a life sentence for ten murders.
Bulger was a fugitive for sixteen years before he was caught in 2011; he
was killed in prison in 2018. The saga was sufficiently infamous that
Hollywood turned it into the 2015 film Black Mass. More commonly,
informant-related misconduct takes place on a smaller scale. Police
officers in Columbus, Ohio, were having sex with their informant
Michelle Szuhay and wanted to help her get a job as a stripper. So
police took Ohio resident Haley Dawson's identity---in the form of her
driver's license and Social Security number---and gave it to Szuhay
without Dawson's knowledge. An arbitrator ruled that the offi- cers'
actions in taking Dawson's identity and giving it to Szuhay were not
illegal, although they constituted "a serious error in judgment."81
[Sometimes police use informants as a cheap and easy way to meet
performance goals.]{.underline} [[Dallas police]{.mark} paid
[informants]{.mark} to [**plant** fake drugs on immigrant
workers]{.mark}, who were then arrested and sometimes deported before
the scam was discovered]{.underline}. The busts were used [[to
inflate]{.mark} the [de- partment's]{.mark} performance
[statistics]{.mark}]{.underline}.82 From the prosecutorial end,
sometimes [misconduct takes the form of misleading courts and defendants
in order to obtain convictions]{.underline}. In prosecuting Blufford
Hayes for murder, for example, a California pros- ecutor cut a deal to
dismiss Andrew James's pending felony charges in exchange for his
testimony against Hayes. [[James]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[received
immu- nity]{.mark} for his own possible involvement in the
murder]{.underline}. [[The prosecutor]{.mark} then [lied to the
court]{.mark}, [insisting]{.mark} that [no deal had been made]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} [elicited James's perjured testimony]{.mark} in front of
the jury]{.underline}.83 Similarly, in the effort to obtain a conviction
in a gruesome double murder, another California district attorney cut a
deal with Norman Thomas, one of the murder defendants who had admitted
to dismem- bering one of the victims. [In exchange for Thomas's
testimony]{.underline} against his codefendant, [the government dropped
his murder charges]{.underline} and ar- ranged that Thomas would avoid a
psychiatric exam that might have undermined his reliability as a
witness. [The prosecution concealed this deal from the defense
attorney]{.underline} and the court. Thomas's testimony was the sole
evidence that the defendant personally committed the murder.84
Disturbing stories exist of [law enforcement officials]{.underline} who
[exploit the secrecy and deregulation of informant use to deploy
snitches for their own personal gain]{.underline}, for example, when
Boston police detective David [Jordan teamed up with an informant to
steal \$81,000 worth of cocaine from a drug dealer]{.underline}.85 In
another scandal, Baltimore police officer Vic- tor Rivera and two other
officers stole three kilograms of cocaine from a drug bust. They gave
the cocaine to one of their informants to sell on the street, with whom
[they]{.underline} then [split the tens of thousands of dollars in
proceeds]{.underline}.86 But the far more common scenario is that of the
agent or prosecutor who bends or breaks the rules on behalf of his
source in pursuit of other criminals and cases. In these ways, otherwise
well- meaning [public officers end up breaking the law in their efforts
to fight crime]{.underline}. Because [using informants inherently
demands the toleration of some levels of criminality]{.underline}, such
[[**official lawlessness** is a]{.mark} predictable [con-
sequence]{.mark} of the practice]{.underline}. E. Crime Victims Although
one of the central purposes of the criminal system is to pro- vide
relief and vindication to crime victims, using informants requires
constant compromises with that purpose. As one frustrated victim of
Marvin Jeffery's identity-theft scheme put it, "I do everything legally.
I vote. My credit is clean. I try to do all the right stuff, follow all
the rules. Then there's this guy, driving around in a gold Escalade,
laugh- ing it up, cashing my checks."87 Karen [[Parker]{.mark}
[was]{.mark} the twelve-year-old girl [molested]{.mark} by]{.underline}
informant Paul [Skalnik]{.underline} in Florida. Parker reported the
sexual assault to the police, even passing a lie detector test,
[[but]{.underline} [Skalnik was too valuable as an
informant]{.underline}]{.mark} [and was never prosecuted]{.underline}.
"No one ever said, 'That's wrong,'" said Parker years later. "[The
message I got was that what he did was O.K.---that it wasn't serious, it
wasn't a crime]{.underline}."88 [Releasing dangerous informants
inherently runs the risk that they will commit new crimes]{.underline}.
Darryl [Moore]{.underline}, for example, [was a known **hit man**, drug
dealer, robber, and **rapist**]{.underline} with a substance use
disorder. His history of perjury was so extensive that his own mother
indicated that she would not believe him under oath. Nevertheless, in
exchange for his testimony in a murder case, Chicago prosecutors offered
him a deal: weapons and drug charges against him would be dropped and he
would be paid cash. [[Moore testified]{.underline}]{.mark} in the case,
although he later stated that [he [**fabricated** his
testimony]{.mark}]{.underline}. After being released and returning to
his home neighborhood, [he [attacked an eleven-year]{.mark}-[old]{.mark}
girl with a gun [and **raped** her]{.mark}]{.underline}.89 Odell
[Hallmon]{.underline}, the snitch who [testified falsely]{.underline}
four times against Curtis Flowers in Mississippi, [avoided punishment in
seven felony cases and was released multiple times]{.underline}. [He
subsequently killed three people]{.underline}.90 [As trading liability
for information has become increasingly common, [it desensitizes
decision makers]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the profound
[[compromises]{.underline}]{.mark} that such law enforcement practices
entail. For example, it is a common drug en- forcement practice to
excuse property crime or violent offenders who provide drug-related
information. Because property and violent crimes have victims, [[the
practice conveys the message]{.mark} to those victims [that]{.mark}
their personal [suffering or need for vindication is less significant
than drug enforcement goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. As discussed at length
in chapter 6, this prob- lem has reached it zenith in poor urban
communities in which the per- vasive use of criminal informants may
actually be exacerbating crime and insecurity. F. Vulnerable Informants

F. Vulnerable Informants Bosco Enriquez was fifteen years old when Miami
police recruited him into [[becoming an informant]{.underline}]{.mark}
against local drug gangs. The teenager wore a wire and provided
information in dozens of cases. As a result of his dangerous work for
police, [[he acquired a substance use disorder]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Police carelessly released his name in court documents]{.underline},
[which led to brutal attacks against]{.underline} [Enriquez]{.underline}
and his family [by]{.underline} angry [gang members]{.underline}. His
substance use disorder landed [Enriquez]{.underline} in prison, where he
[[was raped]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2012, [the]{.underline} U.S.
[government [deported]{.mark} him to Nicaragua]{.underline}, where he
had not been since he was four years old. "[They **betrayed**
me]{.underline}," said the young man to a reporter. "[I put my life on
the line]{.underline} on seven or eight occasions. . . . \[W\]hat really
makes me angry is that \[the police\] didn't help me when I was thrown
out of the country. I asked them, and they said there was nothing they
could do."91 Six years later and over a thousand miles away, New York
law enforce- ment betrayed Henry, a high-school junior who agreed to
inform on other members of his MS-13 gang in exchange for protection and
a new life. [After he cooperated, police turned Henry over to
ICE]{.underline}. ICE used the information that Henry himself provided
to police [to deport the seventeen-year-old back to El Salvador, where,
marked as a snitch, he was]{.underline} likely to be
[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark}.92 Our penal system has little sympathy
for people in the criminal sys- tem. [[People whose rights are
violated]{.mark} or who are physically or psycho- logically harmed
during the criminal process [are]{.mark} often perceived to be getting
what they deserve for having broken the law in the first
place]{.underline}. [This hostility is]{.underline} part of what legal
scholar Sharon Dolovich calls "[[the **dehumanized**, **essentialized**,
and]{.mark} **[unforgiving]{.mark}** conception of the [penal
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}."93 It is what Bryan Stevenson mourns as
our institutional ten- dency [to "reduce people to their worst acts and
permanently label them 'criminal,' 'murderer,' 'rapist,' 'thief,' 'drug
dealer,' 'sex offender,' 'felon'--- identities they cannot
change]{.underline} regardless of the circumstances of their crimes or
any improvements they might make in their lives."94 In the informant
context, [[this **unsympathetic** posture]{.mark} has [translated
into]{.mark} a high tolerance for the]{.underline} risks and [harms
that]{.underline} often [accompany co- operation]{.underline} with the
government, [to the point of explicitly [**devaluing** in- formant
lives]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Judge Richard Posner of the federal
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals bluntly reasoned, confidential
informants often agree to engage in risky undercover work in exchange
for leniency, and we cannot think of any reason, especially any reason
rooted in constitutional text or doctrine, for creating a cat- egorical
prohibition against the informant's incurring \[costs such as\] the
usual risk of being beaten up or for that matter bumped off by a drug
dealer with whom one is negotiating a purchase or sale of drugs in the
hope of obtaining lenient treatment from the government.95 As an ethical
matter, [tolerating]{.underline} such [violence against informants is
reductive [and]{.mark} dehumanizing]{.underline}, [a way of [writing off
their value as people]{.mark}]{.underline}. As an intellectual matter,
[it reflects an uncritical acceptance of the infor- mant deal:
specifically, the assumption]{.underline} that [informants and the
govern- ment bargain on an equal footing and that the risks informants
incur are]{.underline} thus [their own responsibility]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} **[uncritical]{.underline}** [assumption]{.underline}
**[overlooks]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[lopsided]{.underline}**
[power dynamics]{.underline} of the way informants are often created in
the first place. [Informants can be the **most defenseless**
players]{.underline} in the criminal justice drama---those without
counsel or education, those with substance use disorders, young,
frightened, alone, or otherwise suscep- tible to official pressure. As
one sociologist puts it, the creation of an informant "is not a paradigm
of simple bargaining between equals but, rather, a complex interaction
between personnel of the criminal justice system and vulnerable
people."96 Indeed, part of [the process of [creating informants involves
the]{.mark} [**purposeful** **manipulation** of their
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Agent Fitzgerald describes it,
"The method selected for [exerting]{.underline} the
[pressure]{.underline} \[on the in- formant\] varies and [is limited
only by the imagination, experience, and skill of the
investigator]{.underline}."97 Former narcotics agent Mallory is even
more direct: It is a widely accepted fact that [individuals are most
vulnerable to becom- ing cooperative immediately following
arrest]{.underline}. . . . \[I\] learned to "strike" while the "iron is
hot." Informants will often rethink their exposure and decide not to
cooperate if given too much time to contemplate their deci- sion.
However, a night or two in jail can work for the investigator to help
the informant decide to cooperate.98 As noted above, one of a suspect's
most important resources is de- fense counsel, not only to advise them
about how valuable cooperation might be but also to dispel the panic
that many suspects feel when con- fronted with the possibility of
prosecution or incarceration. Accord- ingly, [well-represented,
educated, well-resourced informants are in a better position to make
rational judgments about whether and to what extent to cooperate
or]{.underline} whether [to]{.underline} invoke the adversarial process
and [fight the charges]{.underline} against them. [Vulnerable suspects
such as drug users, juveniles, people with mental disabilities, or those
for whom prison is especially life-threatening are more likely to agree
to cooperate]{.underline} even if the benefits are uncertain or small or
the risks very high. [They may]{.underline} also [be more likely to
provide **false evidence** under pressure to produce
information]{.underline}. [Because police and prosecutors have wide
leeway in negotiating in- formant deals, there are few limits to the
concessions that can be ex- tracted]{.underline} from informants. Many
highly extractive arrangements are perfectly legal. Amy
[Gepfert]{.underline}, for example, [agreed to pose as a prostitute and
engage in oral sex with another suspect in order to avoid cocaine
charges]{.underline}.99 Similarly, the FBI used Helen Miller---a sex
worker dependent on heroin and a fugitive from Canadian drug
charges---as an informant to investigate Darrel Simpson by having sex
with him for five months. The court held that [[neither]{.mark} [the
FBI]{.mark}'s use of **deceptive** sexual intimacy against Simpson, nor
the **[pressure]{.mark}** on [Miller to have sex]{.mark} in order [to
es- cape criminal charges]{.mark} herself, [nor Miller's]{.mark}
continued [illegal drug and sex work]{.mark} activities while serving
[as an informant constituted]{.mark} **[outrageous]{.mark}** government
[conduct]{.mark}]{.underline}.100 Some arrangements are illegal but
happen anyway. [[Police]{.mark} all over the country [have been fired
for **pressuring**]{.mark} their [informants into having sex with
them]{.mark}]{.underline}.101 Since the first edition of this book was
published, the problem of in- formant vulnerability has received far
greater public attention. In 2012, journalist and MacArthur "Genius"
Fellow Sarah Stillman published a widely read article in the New Yorker
titled "The Throwaways," in which she chronicled story after story about
the government's use of young informants and the violence inflicted on
them. Three years later, 60 Min- utes aired a segment about young people
who were killed while work- ing as informants. The story focused on
North Dakota college student Andrew Sadek, whom police pressured into
becoming a drug informant and who was found dead months later. Numerous
colleges have now been exposed and criticized for permitting campus
police to pressure students into becoming informants, including the
University of Mas- sachusetts Amherst, University of Mississippi,
University of Wisconsin, and the U.S. Air Force Academy.102 [Transgender
people can be especially susceptible to the pressure to
cooperate]{.underline}. [Because they face heightened danger of violence
in]{.underline} jails and [prisons]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} may
[go to great lengths to avoid]{.underline} even brief periods of [in-
carceration]{.underline}. Shelly Hilliard, the transgender teenager
whose murder was described in the introduction, agreed to cooperate to
avoid incarcera- tion even though she faced only a minor marijuana
charge.103 [[Immigrants]{.mark} are vulnerable too]{.underline}:
[they]{.underline} can [[experience]{.mark} unique [pressures to
cooperate]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [to obtain a visa or [to avoid
deportation]{.mark}]{.underline}. ProPublica, the Intercept, and other
journalistic outlets have chronicled how [ICE and the FBI use the
promise of]{.underline} a visa---sometimes called [the "**immigration
relief dangle**]{.underline}"---[in conjunction with the threat of
deportation to pressure immigrants]{.underline} into providing
information about others in their communi- ties, often at great risk to
those informants. [Muslim immigrants]{.underline} in par- ticular [have
been targeted]{.underline} by the FBI; [the agency]{.underline}
sometimes [interferes in the immigration process in order to obtain
cooperation]{.underline}, even though the practice violates FBI
regulations.104 For people with mental health issues, cooperation can be
especially risky. Montana police pressured twenty-one-year-old Colton
Peterson into becoming an informant even though they were aware of his
suicidal tendencies; he killed himself the next day.105 [Individuals
with mental disabilities can]{.underline} also [be]{.underline}
**[coerced]{.underline}** or swayed [into providing information that may
not be accurate]{.underline}. For example, Derrick Megress, the
informant in Hearne, Texas, who fingered numerous innocent residents,
suffered from mental disabilities.106 One of the central challenges of
informant use is the pervasive risk and harm it inflicts on people with
substance use disorders. [[Police]{.mark} rou- tinely]{.underline} give
cash to informants, knowing that they will use the money for drugs, or
**[[require]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[people with a]{.mark} [substance
use disorder to engage in]{.mark} risky [drug
transactions]{.mark}]{.underline}. When UMass Amherst
[police]{.underline} pressured Logan into becoming an informant, instead
of reporting his heroin addiction to the university and to his parents
as required, they [pushed him into further drug exposure [while
preventing him from getting medical help]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Logan
died of an overdose]{.underline}. Legislatures are starting to respond
to these kinds of tragedies by considering new rules governing the use
of vulner- able informants. These legislative efforts are discussed in
more detail in chapter 8. To be sure, not all criminal informants are
vulnerable in these ways. Mafia hit men, international drug dealers, and
high-level political op- eratives with well-paid defense attorneys have
a wealth of resources at their disposal in negotiating with the
government. Indeed, some of the worst debacles described in this book
are the result of the government's inability to check or control such
informants. But for the typical person confronted by police without
counsel or other protections, or for the indigent suspect sitting in a
jail cell, the government can be a formidable opponent indeed. Such
[suspects]{.underline} may [agree to become informants out of fear,
ignorance, and their perception that they have no choice]{.underline}.
G. Witness Intimidation and the Spread of Violence In 2004,
fourteen-year-old Jahkema "Princess" Hansen witnessed a murder in her
Washington, D.C., neighborhood. She refused to talk to police and
instead asked the killer and his associate Franklin Thompson to
compensate her for her silence. "For real, little sis, you better not be
snitching," Thompson told her, according to a bystander. Hours later,
Thompson shot and killed Princess.107 Witness intimidation is connected
to informant use in a variety of ways. [Criminal informants are
routinely subject to threats or harm]{.underline}. To a lesser degree,
civilian witnesses may also experience threats, or the fear of
retaliation, when they agree to cooperate in a criminal case. While most
civilian witnesses and criminal informants inhabit different worlds, the
violence associated with criminal snitching has spilled over into the
realm of civilian witnessing. A 2009 investigation by the
[[Philadelphia]{.underline}]{.mark} In- quirer, for example, blamed "an
epidemic" of witness intimidation, and the city's failure to address it,
for Philadelphia's high dismissal rates in violent crime cases.108
Police and prosecutors in numerous cities have stated that it is
difficult to get witnesses to serious crimes to come for- ward. In a
2016 survey, most federal criminal legal officials stated that they were
aware of threats or harms to cooperating defendants in one or more
cases. The survey [[identified **hundreds** of cases in
which]{.underline}]{.mark} coopera- tors or [[witnesses were]{.mark}
threatened or [harmed]{.mark}]{.underline}.109 Various aspects of the
criminal system are responses to this form of informant-related
violence, from witness protection programs to solitary confinement
provisions for cooperating prisoners. Witness intimidation, however, is
just one of the ways in which using informants creates and spreads
violence. [[The]{.mark} widespread [culture of snitching promotes
violence against informants]{.mark} themselves; it tolerates violence
against victims of crimes perpetrated by informants; and it exacerbates
violence against innocent bystanders who must live cheek- by-jowl with
the [violent methods used by gangs to police themselves against
betrayal]{.mark} from the inside]{.underline}. For example,
sixteen-year-old Martha Puebla was killed by Los Angeles gang members
because [police misin- formed]{.underline} Jose Ledesma, [a murder
suspect, that Puebla had identified him and was cooperating with the
police]{.underline}. In fact, Puebla had told the police that she had
not seen Ledesma, but [police forged Puebla's signature]{.underline} on
a fake photo array and showed it to Ledesma [in order to pressure him to
confess]{.underline}. [Instead of confessing, Ledesma ordered Puebla's
murder]{.underline}.110 Indeed, nearly every informant story contained
in this book consti- tutes an example of informant-related violence,
from Darryl Moore's attack on his eleven-year-old victim to the death of
ninety-two-year- old Kathryn Johnston at the hands of Atlanta police
operating on a bad informant tip. One sociological study concludes that
"[[snitching]{.mark} is a pervasive element of inner-city street life
that [poses dangers for street criminals and law-abiding residents
alike]{.mark}]{.underline}."111 [Increases in violence are]{.underline}
thus [a]{.underline} particularly **[devastating]{.underline}** [cost of
informant]{.underline} [policies]{.underline}. H. Systemic Integrity and

V. Informant Use in Comparative Perspective [The United States permits
law enforcement to use]{.underline} criminal [informants more freely
than do many other countries]{.underline}. [These differences
highlight]{.underline} some fundamental policy choices adopted by
American law enforcement and courts. One is the tolerance of high levels
of informant unreliability. Another is [the
notion]{.underline}---[central to the practice of **plea
bargaining**---that it is permissible to trade away criminal liability
in exchange for infor- mation]{.underline}. [Another]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} reflected in [the governmental acceptance of, and even
engagement in, ongoing criminal activity]{.underline}. These are
controversial precepts that many [other nations]{.underline} have
[resisted]{.underline} or declined to accept altogether.95 As law
professor Jacqueline Ross explains with respect to Europe in particular,
"The United States and European nations con- ceptualize, legitimate, and
control undercover policing in substantially dissimilar ways."96 [For
some countries, th[e **unreliability** associated with
informants]{.mark} has [made them]{.mark} a **highly**
**[disfavored]{.mark}** tool]{.underline}. In 1997, for example, the
govern- ment of Ontario, Canada, appointed a commission to review the
wrong- ful murder conviction of Guy Paul Morin. After hearings that
lasted over five months and called 120 witnesses, the Kaufman Commission
con- cluded that Morin's wrongful conviction was due in large part to
the tes- timony of two jailhouse informants who fabricated evidence that
Morin had confessed to the murder. The commission also found that "[the
[sys- temic evidence]{.mark} emanating [from Canada, Great Britain,
Australia]{.mark} and the United States [demonstrated]{.mark} that the
dangers associated with jail- house informants were not unique to the
Morin case]{.underline}. Indeed, a number of [**[miscarriages of
justice]{.mark}** throughout the world are]{.underline} likely
[[explained]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least in part, [[by the **false
self-serving**]{.mark} [ev]{.mark}idence given [by]{.mark} such
[informants]{.mark}]{.underline}." The commission issued dozens of
recommendations for reform, includ- ing limiting the use and reward of
informants, increased disclosure, and improved police and prosecutorial
training.97 As a result of the commis- sion's recommendations, the
Canadian attorney general established new policies limiting jailhouse
informant use.98 [For other countries]{.underline}, the
[covert]{.underline} practices associated with [informant use are
considered legally and morally problematic]{.underline}. Methods such as
the "bust-and-buy" sting and informant lenience deals, while standard in
the United States and United Kingdom,99 have been resisted by other
European countries, often on the principle that the government should
neither engage in criminal conduct nor tolerate it. Well into the 1970s,
"\[t\]hroughout most of continental Europe, . . . virtually all these
\[un- dercover\] techniques were viewed, even by police officials, as
unneces- sary, unacceptable, and often illegal." Today, many European
countries engage in some form of these tactics, but to a lesser degree
than does American law enforcement.100 [In the Netherlands]{.underline},
for example, the Dutch began adopting American-style undercover tactics
in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the gov- ernment was rocked by scandal when
it was revealed that [police and]{.underline} highly paid criminal
[informants were actively running drug operations, importing tons of
drugs into the country]{.underline}, some of which were released onto
the streets. The resulting Parliamentary Inquiry from 1995 to 1996 led
to significant restrictions on law enforcement authority to use crimi-
nal informants and to engage in U.S.-style undercover operations.101
Central to the Dutch public debate over informant use has been the
contrast with American practices. According to Police Commissioner René
Karstens, Dutch and American law enforcement take fundamen- tally
different approaches to questions of informant legality and the need for
regulation: "\[T\]he philosophies on infiltration \[by informants\] were
rather divergent. [Where we \[Dutch\] feel]{.underline} that certain
[limitations are needed on infiltration as a method, [the Americans are
inclined to let **the end justify the means**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[With them **anything goes**]{.underline}]{.mark}."102 In Italy,
criminal informant use is broadly constrained by the "con- cern that
undercover operations might corrode the rule of law by en- abling police
to engage in 'crime.'" If they have not obtained explicit authorization,
Italian law enforcement officials may be prosecuted for crimes they
commit or permit in pursuit of criminal targets and inves- tigations. In
order to permit some undercover investigations, Italian law thus
contains a series of narrow exceptions that relieve police of criminal
liability for specific acts such as the simulated drug buy or postponing
arrests and seizures for investigative purposes---acts that would other-
wise be deemed illegal police conduct.103 Under U.S. law, by contrast,
such decisions are committed to law enforcement discretion without
threat of criminal liability or even judicial review. Similarly, the
legal culture in Germany includes a prohibition against the official
toleration of lawbreaking. In 1992, under pressure to permit greater use
of undercover tactics, Germany passed reforms designed to legitimize a
limited form of undercover policing. Those reforms per- mit the use of
undercover informants only in connection with serious crimes and only
when it is extremely difficult for police to obtain evi- dence by other
means. The reforms were accompanied by great contro- versy: as one
German official commented, "undercover investigations should always be
considered a tactic of last resort."104 Such social and legal distaste
for [[informant use]{.underline} [stands]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} stark con- trast to [[the]{.mark} former
**[Soviet Union]{.mark}**, where the use of informants was con- sidered
not so much a "necessary evil" as a "fundamental means of pursuing both
ordinary criminals [and]{.mark} individuals who might prove a political
threat to the regime]{.underline}." There, [a lack of legal safeguards
and the official premium placed on the state's interest made informant
recruit- ment and use widespread.]{.underline}105 [Snitching has been a
prominent feature of authoritarianism in other countries]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} [former [East German]{.mark} government was infamous
for con- ducting **pervasive surveillance** of its own citizens through
informants working for the state secret police]{.underline}, known as
the "Stasi." Indeed, [the use of [informants]{.mark}]{.underline} in
that context [[came to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} seen as a
[paradigmatic]{.mark} aspect [of **authoritarianism**]{.mark} precisely
because [it reflected]{.mark} such [**offensive disrespect** for citizen
privacy and autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}.106 [The use of informants has
also been associated with the Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territories and the British occupation of Northern
Ireland]{.underline}.107 The ongoing evolution of informant use around
the world reflects broader developments in international law
enforcement. Collaborative international drug enforcement efforts, for
example, have had a signifi- cant impact on the law and practices of
European nations. Drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann describes the
"Americanization of European drug enforcement" as the gradual adoption
of DEA-style methods of drug investigation by countries such as Germany,
the Netherlands, Aus- tria, Belgium, France, Spain, and Italy.108 Such
methods have introduced more reliance on undercover criminal informants,
more trading of li- ability, and more tolerance of ongoing crime than
European criminal systems have historically accepted. In the
antiterrorism arena in particular, there have been calls for the
harmonization of legal standards to permit more international collabo-
ration. Professor Ross has pointed out the significant challenges that
such cooperation entails: Nations would need to renegotiate the tense
political compromises legiti- mating undercover operations (which are
everywhere controversial, but for different reasons). And they would
need to revise the practices and procedures not just of undercover
investigations, but of their domestic policing regime, including in
areas that at first glance appear unrelated. Champions of closer
cooperation who call on countries to overcome in- sularity in the
interest of collective struggles against international crime and
terrorism do not appear to appreciate the scale and depth of the
requisite transformation of domestic policing regimes or the difficulty
of reshaping the political compromises currently legitimating undercover
operations.109 VI. American Informant Law The laws of informant use
embody a nation's stance toward weighty issues: Are guilt and punishment
negotiable? What are the appropri- ate limits on police and
prosecutorial authority? How much protection should be afforded to
individual privacy? Each nation's "informant law" reflects the
confluence of legislative, judicial, and executive authority, as well as
these kinds of important public values. The United States is nota- ble
for the ways in which the legislative and judicial branches have ceded
authority on this issue to executive law enforcement. As the sociolo-
gist Gary Marx pointed out years ago, "Unlike some Western European
countries or Japan, legislatures in the United States have indirectly
sup- ported undercover practices by their consistent failure to set
standards and goals for police performance. Legislatures, like the
courts, generally prefer to leave such matters to police, thus enacting
a kind of legiti- macy by default."110 [The [U]{.mark}.[S]{.mark}.
philosophy of [informant law]{.mark} thus [stands at the **far
end**]{.mark} of the international spectrum, [privileging]{.mark} [law
enforcement]{.mark} authority, discretion, [and secrecy]{.mark}
[over]{.mark} [the]{.mark} dangers and [intrusions]{.mark} [posed
by]{.mark} criminal [informant use]{.mark}]{.underline}. The overall
picture of [American informant law is one of tremendous official
authority and discretion to use, reward, and pressure criminal
informants with **few legal limits**]{.underline}. The constraints that
do exist tend to focus on the government's informational obligations
rather than sub- stantive limits on the government's choices, and even
those [informa- tional obligations are tied to litigation and trials
that occur infrequently]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} end result of this
**[laissez-faire]{.mark}**, [**unregulated** approach
is]{.mark}]{.underline} that the American informant market is centrally
[[shaped]{.underline} [by]{.underline}]{.mark} the individual de-
cisions of police and prosecutors, with [[few]{.mark} external
[controls]{.mark} and [little]{.mark} judicial [oversight or]{.mark}
legislative or public [scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}.111 72 3 Juries and

5 Secret Justice Every thing secret degenerates, even the administration
of justice; nothing is safe that does not show it can bear discus- sion
and publicity. --- Lord Acton (1861)1 [Informant practices are
**inherently secretive**]{.underline}: [snitches]{.underline} often
[need their identities protected for safety]{.underline}, while the
effectiveness of informant- driven investigations turns on their
clandestine nature. But the secretive effects of using informants go far
beyond protecting ongoing investi- gations or concealing particular
informants' identities. Snitching has altered the ways in which U.S.
criminal investigations are conducted and recorded; it affects public
record keeping by police and prosecutors, discovery practices, and what
gets written down during plea negotia- tions. It has also shaped the
informational rules prescribed by Supreme Court doctrine, internal
judicial branch information policies, and even information-sharing
between the U.S. Department of Justice and Congress. In other words,
[[the pressure to conceal]{.mark} [informant]{.mark}
practices]{.underline} broadly [[affects]{.underline}]{.mark} the
criminal system's culture of [[record keeping]{.mark}, adver- sarial
[info]{.mark}rmation-[sharing]{.mark}, public policy, [and]{.mark}
[disclosure]{.mark}, [making the]{.mark} entire [process
**less**]{.mark} **[transparent]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} less
[accountable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sometimes informant practices make it
harder for the public to ac- cess documents and processes that have
traditionally been publicly available. For example, a 2006 investigation
by the Associated Press re- vealed the existence of [widespread sealing
and "[secret dockets]{.mark}" in the federal court system]{.underline}
for Washington, D.C. Nearly five thousand crimi- nal cases remained
sealed long after the case was over, and for hundreds of those cases,
the system falsely indicated that there was "no such case" if the case
number was entered into the system. [Most of the cases [in-
volved]{.mark} cooperating [government witnesses]{.mark}]{.underline}.2
In 2016, the Federal Judicial Center conducted a survey of federal
lawyers and judges on the extent of threats to cooperators. In response
to the survey, a committee of [the U.S. Judicial Conference
recommended]{.underline} additional widespread [sealing]{.underline},
specifically the creation of a "sealed supplement" to [every federal
crimi- nal case to shield all sentencing and cooperation information
from the public]{.underline}.3 Several [federal]{.underline} [judicial
districts]{.underline} have already **[eliminated]{.underline}** [public
website access to docket entries and to plea agreements in criminal
cases]{.underline}. The purpose of the protocols is [[to make it
impossible to discern]{.mark} without physically coming to the
courthouse [whether a defendant is cooperating]{.mark}]{.underline}.
They also prevent the public from seeing whether court documents are
sealed in the first place---considered a red flag that suggests
cooperation.4 [Informant]{.underline} use also [naturally decreases
transparency due to its infor- mality]{.underline}. [Highly regulated
formal spaces tend to be better documented, informal spaces less so.
Because [informant]{.mark} law gives police and prosecu- tors so much
informal discretion and leeway]{.underline} in the creation, manage-
ment, and rewarding of informants, that [[informality]{.mark} inherently
[demands less documentation, public record keeping, and external
accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}. These are a few of the ways in
which using informants curtails public access to information about how
we adjudicate guilt and impose pun- ishment. The loss is significant
because [[we rely]{.mark} [on]{.mark} such [info]{.mark}rmation [to
monitor whether the criminal system is]{.mark} effective and
[fair]{.mark}]{.underline}---in individual cases and also
[systemically]{.underline}. [Taking such information off the public re-
cord thus bolsters law enforcement authority while reducing the ability
of legislatures, courts, the press, and the public to evaluate executive
ac- tors [and]{.mark} hold them [accountable]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is a powerful and often troubling hallmark of informant culture and one
of the dynamics that tends to go unremarked precisely because it takes
place beneath the public radar. This chapter traces the depublicizing
influence of informant use through several main areas of the criminal
process---investigation, plea bargain- ing, and discovery---and its
global impact on public access to informa- tion about the penal system.
I. Investigation As a general matter, the process of investigating crime
is one of the least regulated, least public aspects of the legal
system.5 Police deci- sions such as whether to investigate a crime or
make an arrest are for the most part not subject to legal challenge or
judicial review.6 They are accordingly subject to few documentation
requirements.7 Police reports---which record police decisions and the
information gathered during investigations---are notoriously partial and
provide only a lim- ited window of information, if they provide any
information at all.8 Sometimes police reporting is purposefully opaque:
the police depart- ments of Chicago and New York long maintained a
system of "double files" in which publicly accessible police reports,
including those given to prosecutors, contained only a partial version
of the facts, while the department's internal "street files" contained
fuller information.9 This tradition of undocumented investigative
decision-making has been challenged in a variety of ways, including
decades-long demands for civilian review boards.10 For several decades,
we have seen numerous attempts to require police to collect data on
racial profiling practices.11 The excitement and controversies around
body camera technologies are in large part about the tantalizing
possibility of greater transparency and accountability regarding
day-to-day police decision-making.12 The bit- ter struggles over these
kinds of reforms reflect deep-seated traditions of discretionary
policing, in which collecting public policing data has been a foreign
and often difficult innovation. The use of criminal [informants is a
paradigmatic example of this kind of **discretionary**, undocumented
decision-making]{.underline}; [it is]{.underline} also [a **powerful
engine** of its expansion]{.underline}. In practice, [police can flip a
suspect, obtain information, and maintain an ongoing relationship with
an informant without ever publicly revealing the
transactions]{.underline}. Police reports will often omit mention of
informant sources, while search warrant applications typically do not
reveal informant identities. If police so choose, [the crimes committed
by cooperating informants may never be recorded]{.underline}.
Conversely, harms to cooperators may remain secret as well.
[[Informant]{.mark}- based [investigations]{.mark}]{.underline} thus
[[slip]{.mark} easily **[beneath the radar]{.mark}** of the criminal
system's documentation processes]{.underline}. The unregulated character
of informant investigations is no acci- dent. Starting with its decision
in Hoffa v. United States, [the Supreme Court]{.underline} has
methodically [exempted]{.underline} [informant]{.underline} creation and
[deployment from]{.underline} the kinds of [constitutional
regulations]{.underline} [that cover]{.underline} other investiga- tive
techniques, including [Fourth Amendment]{.underline} rules on searches,
sei- zures, and warrants, the [Fifth Amendment]{.underline} requirement
that suspects be given Miranda warnings and counsel, and [Sixth
Amendment]{.underline} right-to counsel rules.13 In turn, [because
police are less constrained when using informants, this naturally makes
informant-based investigations easier, cheaper, and more
inviting]{.underline}. If the police can persuade an informant to
cooperate in order to obtain information about a target, that decision
is hard for third parties to challenge, and if it turns up no evidence,
it need never be revealed. Likewise, a wired informant can collect
information whenever the police want her to, off the record. By
contrast, if the po- lice apply for a warrant or a wiretap, they must
justify their requests to a court, their requests could be denied, and
their justifications can be challenged later by defense counsel. For
example, instead of getting a warrant, Virginia police used con- victed
burglars as informants to break into a suspect's home to look for
marijuana. According to one of the informants, Renaldo Turnbull, po-
lice assured them that they would be protected if they burglarized the
suspect's home: "The \[police\] dude said he was going to look out for
us, so let's go do it," he said. Turnbull also explained the general
instructions that he received from his police handler: "He told me what
to look for. He said, if you know of any burglaries or anything, let
\[him\] know. He said no evidence, no pay. He said if you know where it
is, go get it."14 When police do decide to seek a search warrant, the
process becomes more regulated and requires more documentation. To get a
warrant, an officer must submit a sworn affidavit containing information
sufficient to find "probable cause," that is to say, enough evidence
from which the judge could conclude that there is a fair probability of
criminal activity or evidence. When a police officer proffers an
informant tip in order to obtain a warrant, she needs to provide the
judge with enough in- formation about that informant and that tip so
that the judge can in- dependently determine whether the informant is
sufficiently reliable and therefore whether probable cause exists. This
process is designed to ensure that warrants issue in conformity with the
Fourth Amendment, which states that "no warrant shall issue but upon
probable cause sup- ported by oath or affirmation."15 Even in this more
regulated, documented arena, using informants erodes public
transparency. In Pittsburgh, for example, a 2014 inves- tigation
identified what it called "an informant mill in which suspects became
informants and helped agents to bust others, who then in turn became
informants aimed at other targets." The study found that nearly 40
percent of federal prosecutions in southwestern Pennsylvania in- volved
an affidavit based on an unnamed confidential informant, the vast
majority of whom were seeking leniency for their own crimes. The
majority of requests were filed by the FBI or the DEA, but they also in-
cluded affidavits from the Postal Inspection Service, the ATF, Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S.
Secret Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, the IRS, the Department of
Agriculture, and Homeland Security. In all but a tiny number of cases,
judges granted the request for a warrant or a wiretap without question-
ing the reliability or identity of the unnamed informant.16 In his
exhaustive study of narcotics warrants issued in San Diego in 1998, law
professor Lawrence Benner discovered that informant-based warrant
applications involved more secrecy and demanded less rigor than warrant
doctrine contemplates. For example, [64 percent of all war- rant
applications studied relied on a]{.underline} confidential informant, or
"[[CI]{.underline}]{.mark}," and [95 percent of those warrant
applications withheld the identity of the in- formant from the
magistrate]{.underline}. [Police justified doing so on the basis of the
following generic boilerplate language contained in each warrant
application: I desire to keep said informant anonymous because CI has
requested me to do so,]{.underline} and because it is my experience that
informants suffer physi- cal, social and emotional retribution when
their identities are revealed, because it is my experience that to
reveal the identity of such informants seriously impairs their utility
to law enforcement, and because it is my ex- perience that revealing
such informants' identities prevents other citizens from disclosing
confidential information about criminal activities to law enforcement
officers.17 As Benner points out, [the use of]{.underline} such
**[[boilerplate]{.mark} [language]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[provides
no]{.mark} factual or case-specific [support for]{.mark}]{.underline}
the proposition that the particular informant's identity needs to be
withheld from the court, which violates both the rule and spirit of
[[the warrant]{.mark} process]{.underline}: A public entity is granted a
privilege to refuse to disclose the identity of an informant only if the
public interest requires it because the "necessity for preserving the
confidentiality of \[the informant's identity\] outweighs the necessity
for disclosure in the interests of justice." . . . [The use of boil-
erplate . . . bypasses this entire process and indeed denies judges the
very information they would be required to have in order to make a
determi- nation that the CI's identity should not be
revealed]{.underline}.18 The same study also revealed the practice of
using "[phantom affidavits]{.underline}," in which the officer seeking
the warrant does not know the confidential informant on whom she is
relying for the information but rather swears under oath that another
officer told her that the informant provided that other officer with the
incriminating information. This practice means that the officer applying
for the warrant does not know the identity of her source for probable
cause and that, more generally, [[no officer ever has to swear]{.mark}
under oath [to the existence of the informant]{.mark} at
all]{.underline}.19 Such practices do not necessarily mean that police
are fabricating informants or that informants are lying. But they weaken
established provisions for judicial oversight of search warrants and
obscure from public view the means by which police obtain their
evidence. [Because [informants]{.mark} can so easily be kept
secret]{.underline}---even from the very police of- ficer seeking the
warrant---[they [become a **cheap**]{.mark}, [**unregulated** means
for]{.mark} police to obtain the weighty investigative and highly
[intrusive authority]{.mark} of a warrant]{.underline}. [Because
investigative constraints tend not to apply to informant practices, this
has fueled a **culture of secrecy** that goes beyond the lack of
documentation]{.underline}. [Using snitches has become a method of
**conceal- ing** investigative techniques]{.underline} and police
decisions, a practice in which the usual disclosure rules do not apply,
one [in which **cutting corners** and **breaking rules** can easily be
hidden]{.underline}. Recall from chapter 4 the St. Louis police officers
who lied about their informants and then tried to enforce the culture of
secrecy by refusing to disclose the identity of their informants to
their own police supervisors. In a similar vein, the Brooklyn police
officers who traded drugs for information from their snitches were
responding to systemic incentives: to use illegal infor- mant deals to
get quick and easy drug busts. They could do so because [their
investigatory relationship with those snitches was discretionary,
undocumented, and likely never to come to light]{.underline}. The same
dynamic fueled the tragic death of Kathryn Johnston described at the
begin- ning of this book, in which Atlanta [[police]{.underline}]{.mark}
used an unreliable tip from a drug dealer to get a warrant, fabricated
an informant for the warrant application, and then pressured another
snitch to lie to cover up their misrepresentations. They [could behave

#### Informant culture causes crime -- decreases trust, doesn't enforce rules, and encourages law-breaking to not be found out as a snitch

For these socially fragile, heavily policed communities, law enforce-
ment policies have special significance. In many ways, criminal enforce-
ment is the most palpable form of governance to make itself felt in
these neighborhoods. Not only do criminal policies affect individuals
and their families who are touched by crime; routine experiences with
police, prosecutors, probation officers, and courts alter the ways that
residents perceive the entire governmental apparatus. In communities
where the penal system plays such a large role, law enforcement
practices influ- ence people's more general perceptions of the
legitimacy, effectiveness, and fairness of the government, above and
beyond its narrow crime- fighting function.11 When those practices are
persistently debilitating or exclusionary, they can, as legal scholar
Monica Bell puts it, "operate to effectively banish whole communities
from the body politic."12 As my Baltimore students made clear, informant
use is one of these normatively influential practices. Drug enforcement
has focused its resources in these neighborhoods, resulting in some of
the heaviest concentrations of drug-related arrests and convictions in
the country.13 [Central to]{.underline} this pervasive drug
[enforcement]{.underline} presence [is]{.underline} the creation and
maintenance of criminal [informants]{.underline}. [These already
vulnerable commu- nities thus experience the consequences of snitching
to a higher and more extreme degree]{.underline}. This confluence has
important implications. First, [there will be more criminal informants
in these communities than elsewhere]{.underline}, in some neighborhoods
many more. [This is detrimental to families, personal relationships, and
social networks]{.underline}. Second, [perva- sive snitching
exacerbates]{.underline} certain kinds of [crime and
violence]{.underline}, [worsen- ing the very neighborhood conditions
that law enforcement is ostensibly tasked with remedying]{.underline}.
Third, [[using informants is a **racial focusing** mechanism]{.mark},
[**exacerbating** overpolicing]{.mark} and imposing the costs of infor-
mant use disproportionately on communities of color.]{.underline} And
fourth, [the widespread use of criminal [informants]{.mark}
[alters]{.mark} the role and authority of [the legal system]{.mark}
itself: [it shapes police interactions]{.mark} with suspects, [de- forms
police relationships]{.mark} with residents, [and worsens]{.mark} the
[community]{.mark}'s [experiences]{.mark} and perceptions [of being
policed]{.mark}]{.underline}. I. More Snitches How many criminal
informants might be active in low-income, heavily policed neighborhoods?
This is a tough question because no one, not even the officials who use
them, knows how many informants exist in the entire system. Even without
direct data, however, we can extrapolate. In a nutshell, based on
overall cooperation rates and the prevalence of drug enforcement in the
most heavily policed communities of color, it is reasonable to infer
that as many as 4 percent of the young Black male population in these
particular communities might be actively cooperat- ing with police at
any given time. The federal system provides the most information. The
U.S. Sentenc- ing Commission reports that, in 2019, approximately 10
percent of all federal defendants received a sentencing departure for
cooperation and 22.6 percent of drug defendants did.14 An early report
by Sentencing Commission researchers estimates that less than half of
all cooperating defendants receive a recorded sentencing benefit.15
Conservatively, if only half of all cooperating defendants get
sentencing credit, this would suggest that about 20 percent of all
federal offenders and 45 percent of federal drug defendants cooperate in
some way even if their sentences do not publicly reflect it. These
cooperating defendants do not include the approximately 30,000
confidential informants---who also often commit crimes---who work for
the FBI and the DEA.16 While illuminating, federal statistics are of
limited value in assessing the national state of affairs. First, the
federal criminal system is small, comprising less than 5 percent of U.S.
felony cases. Furthermore, as de- scribed above, the federal sentencing
guidelines and U.S. criminal code are expressly designed to promote
cooperation through the mechanics of mandatory minimum sentences and
constraints on judicial discretion. State criminal systems often treat
these issues differently. Accordingly, while the federal picture of
pervasive cooperation is relatively clear, it is only one piece of a
larger puzzle. At the state and local levels, we have far less direct
information. Un- like the federal system, most states lack systemic
record keeping to track defendants who benefit from having cooperated,
either at sentencing or at earlier stages in a case. Nevertheless, while
local law enforcement does not directly reveal how often it uses or
rewards informants, we can still deduce the probable impact of informant
use on heavily policed Black communities. First of all, we know that
drug arrests and prosecutions are concen- trated in Black neighborhoods
and populations: African Americans ac- count for approximately 13
percent of the national population but 32 percent of national drug
arrests and approximately 30 percent of drug convictions.17 In
particular, Black people are nearly four times more likely to be
arrested for marijuana possession, which represents over 40 percent of
all drug arrests.18 Criminal informants are staple features of such
investigations and cases. All by itself, therefore, the scale of drug
enforcement against the Black population indicates that the scale of
criminal informant use will be similarly and disproportionately large.
We also know that drug enforcement is not evenly distributed. In certain
states and counties, Black arrest rates are especially high, even though
drug use is evenly distributed throughout the population. For example,
in Pickens County, Georgia, about an hour north of Atlanta, Black people
are almost a hundred times more likely to be arrested for marijuana
possession compared to white people.19 Criminal system involvement is
also heavily concentrated in certain cities and neighborhoods, placing a
staggering proportion of young Af- rican American men under criminal
supervision at any given time. For example, in Maryland, approximately
30 percent of the young African American men in the entire state are
under the control of the criminal system on any given day, which is to
say, in prison or jail or on probation or parole; approximately 10
percent are actually behind bars. In Balti- more, the numbers are even
higher: over half of the young Black men between the ages of twenty and
thirty are under criminal justice control, and nearly one in five are in
custody on any given day.20 Similarly, in one neighborhood in Milwaukee,
an estimated 42 percent of Black males be- tween the ages of twenty-five
and thirty-four were either incarcerated or under criminal justice
supervision in 2013. In North Nashville, Tennes- see, in 2012, the
incarceration rate alone---not including supervision--- for Black men of
that age was 28 percent.21 Cities and neighborhoods with high levels of
criminal-system in- volvement are deeply intertwined with state carceral
institutions. Four- teen percent of all people released from Maryland
prisons in 2001, nearly 40 percent of whom were convicted of drug
offenses, returned to a mere six Baltimore neighborhoods.22 Similarly,
in 2003, half of all re- leased prisoners in Illinois returned to
Chicago, and 34 percent of those returned to just six neighborhoods.23
In all these ways, criminal-system involvement is often highly localized
in specific neighborhoods in ways that national statistics and averages
obscure. Finally, we can ask the question that brought us here: How much
of this highly localized involvement in the criminal system implicates
snitching in communities of color? One way of approximating an an- swer
is to ask how much of this criminal involvement involves drug offenses,
substance use, or other crimes that law enforcement typically handles by
creating or using informants. The answer is probably about one-third.
Approximately 30 percent of all state felony caseloads are drug
offenses, and approximately 30 percent of state felony drug prison- ers
are African American.24 Of the 10 million arrests made in 2019, 1.5
million were drug arrests, and 26 percent of those drug arrests were of
Black people. Conversely, 15 percent of all arrests of Black people are
for drug offenses.25 Drug enforcement is not the only high-snitch arena.
Burglary, for example, is an arena in which police traditionally rely on
informants, representing a little over 8 percent of all state felony
convictions.26 Widespread substance use among the criminally involved
population also plays a crucial role. Many people commit crimes such as
burglary, theft, and other property offenses in order to support an
addiction. For example, from 2007--2009, 40 percent of all jailed
defendants in the United States reported that they committed their
offenses while under the influence of drugs, and 40 percent of people
jailed for a property of- fense reported committing the offense in order
to get money for drugs.27 More broadly, approximately 60 percent of
people in prisons and jails meet medically established criteria for drug
dependence or abuse.28 A large percentage of property crimes and other
offenses are thus "drug- related," in the sense that the defendant
commits the crime because of a substance use disorder. Because such
defendants have knowledge of and connections to the drug economy, they
are prime candidates to become informants. The pervasiveness of
substance use in the criminal justice population---and the law
enforcement predilection for turning such in- dividuals into
snitches---therefore suggests that pressure to inform is being brought
to bear in a wide range of cases. Taken together, we can infer that at
least [**one-third** of the entire U.S. criminal justice population is
facing drug or drug-related charges and/or has a substance use disorder
and therefore is likely to experience strong pressure to
cooperate]{.underline}. [More than one-third of African Americans in the
criminal system will]{.underline} likely [fall into this category
because they make up a higher proportion of drug cases]{.underline}.
[The system]{.underline} naturally [puts pressure on this]{.underline}
segment of the [population to become informants by virtue of the nature
of their offenses, their substance use problems, and the increas- ingly
heavy sentences that drug and recidivist defendants face]{.underline}.
But pressure is one thing, and snitching is quite another. How many
suspects actually bend to the pressure and provide information? Again,
we need to extrapolate. [Federal statistics suggest a general
cooperation rate of **20 percent**, and **45 percent** for drug
offenses]{.underline}, but that will not hold true for all state or
local jurisdictions. The pressure to cooperate is probably higher for
federal drug crimes than it is in jurisdictions that lack high minimum
sentences, mandatory sentencing guidelines, or that generally sentence
at a lower threshold, although some states imitate the federal
cooperation incentive structure.29 On the other hand, the federal system
deals less with the kinds of petty drug offenses that are ripe for
snitching, and the kinds of informal street deals described throughout
this book are more likely to occur between local substance users and
beat cops than with the FBI. For the sake of argument, let us assume
that state and local drug sus- pects snitch at half the rate of federal
drug defendants. In other words, [assume that **22 percent** of this
high-risk group]{.underline} actually [cooperates]{.underline} with law
enforcement, providing information about accomplices, acquain- tances,
friends, neighbors, or family. The implications of this estimate are
potentially dramatic. [In those localized highly policed neighborhoods
in which as many as half of the Black men between the ages of twenty and
thirty are under crimi- nal supervision, one-third of those fall into
the high-risk, drug-related snitching group]{.underline}. If as many as
22 percent of those individuals are actually informants, that would mean
that, in some of these neighborhoods, [[**one in twenty-five** Black
men]{.mark} in this age group---[or]{.mark} about **[4
percent]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[be giving the]{.mark} [government]{.mark}
[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} at any given time. In 2009, using
these same types of data, I estimated the scale of infor- mant use to be
higher, closer to 6 percent of the young Black male popu- lation in
heavily policed neighborhoods. Since then, drug enforcement has receded
as a percentage of national criminal dockets and Black drug
incarceration rates have fallen, so it stands to reason that informant
use would also decline. Remember these are all extrapolations---we have
no more direct data on the phenomenon today than we did in 2009. But 4
percent would still be a lot. It would implicate many extended fami-
lies, apartment complexes, neighborhood events, and congregations. It
would make it likely that [someone]{.underline}---maybe more than one
someone--- [within]{.underline} [that]{.underline} institution or
[social network would have already given in- formation to the police or
might actively be trying to find incriminating information]{.underline}
about others and would have the police's ear when they do. To be sure,
this estimate may still be too high. In some districts, po- lice and
prosecutors indicate that they do not routinely rely on criminal
informants, even in drug cases. Alternatively, [this estimate may still
be **too low**]{.underline}. Many observers of the criminal system, from
judges to soci- ologists, conclude that [drug cases almost **always**
involve snitches, that street-level criminal suspects **routinely**
cooperate with the police, and that informing is
**pervasive**]{.underline}. In sum, we simply do not know directly or
with any certainty how many people are actually working criminal
informants or how many young African American men are under pressure to
inform. Given the persistent lack of data, we cannot know. And the most
serious mani- festation of the phenomenon will be limited to those
neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of crime, police presence,
and social vulnerability. But we do know that the structure of the penal
system, with its continuous deep penetration into poor Black
communities, to- gether with the habits of law enforcement, make it
likely that in our most economically distressed neighborhoods a
significant proportion of the young Black male population is under heavy
governmental pres- sure to provide information about others in order to
avoid arrest and incarceration. Answering the empirical question of how
many snitches there are does not, of course, answer the normative
question: What's wrong with a lot of snitching? After all, residents of
vulnerable communities have a deep interest in crime control, not least
because high crime rates can mean high victimization rates. Such
communities need police with the tools to prevent and solve crimes.
Using criminal informants can be one way for police to get such
information. Numbers alone also cannot explain what is problematic about
living around snitches. It is sometimes said that only the guilty should
fear informants because only the guilty have something to hide. If the
prac- tice successfully disrupts criminal activity, law-abiding citizens
should benefit. There is some truth in both these propositions.
High-crime commu- nities need better crime control, better relations
between police and resi- dents, and more safety and security. The tricky
question is whether those goals are promoted by creating and deploying
criminal informants in the ways that we currently do. And although the
criminal process resists disclosure on this subject, the limited
evidence indicates that [snitching practices may be
counterproductive]{.underline} in precisely this regard. Not only do
[informants exacerbate crime, violence, and other destructive phenom-
ena; even for the innocent, the pervasive presence of criminals trying
to work off their charges can create fear, distrust, and social
dysfunction]{.underline}. These problems are explored below. II. More
Crime Criminal informants commit crimes. This is true both by definition
and in practice. First, by definition, an informant provides information
in order to escape the consequences of having already committed, or at
least being suspected of committing, a crime. That means that [[every
snitch]{.mark} deal inherently [involves a]{.mark} governmental
[decision not to]{.mark} pursue and [punish]{.mark} those
[crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Active criminal [[informants]{.mark} also
typically [com- mit new crimes]{.mark} or help others do so
[while]{.mark} they are [cooperating]{.mark} with the
government]{.underline}. Those new crimes impact the communities in
which they take place. For example, in Mount Vernon, New York, officers
protected and sup- ported drug dealers who served as their informants.
According to secret tapes made by a police whistleblower, "the
department's narcotics unit allowed favored drug dealers to sell with
impunity, get deliveries, and control territory. In exchange, . . . the
dealers, serving as confidential informants, gave \[police\] information
leading to the arrests of their own low-level clients."30 Similarly, as
part of its investigation into a fencing ring in Portland, Oregon, the
FBI promoted the ongoing theft of retail merchandise from local stores
in order to collect evidence against ille- gal secondhand sellers. The
shoplifting ringleaders---Lorie Brewster and David Pankratz---were given
immunity from prosecution and permitted to keep hundreds of thousands of
dollars in proceeds from the goods they stole.31 Above and beyond such
authorized crimes, [[informants]{.mark} also routinely [commit
unauthorized crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the stories throughout this
book dem- onstrate, once a criminal actor agrees to provide information
to the gov- ernment, he or she may continue to commit new offenses on
their own initiative to which police and prosecutors may turn a blind
eye. The fact that law enforcement tolerates some unchecked criminality
by its infor- mants constitutes one of the practice's major dangers and
poses a special threat to communities in which this conduct takes place.
For example, the Seattle ATF used Joshua Allan Jackson as an informant
even though he had a long history of violence against women. His prison
records revealed him to be a mentally unstable person who had been
arrested in forty-three states. In 2012, he held an eighteen-year-old
woman as a sexual prisoner in a motel room paid for by the ATF.32 In
Pittsburgh, Robert Harper robbed a grocery store worker with an AK-47
after local police and prosecutors released him from jail in exchange
for his grand jury testimony about jailhouse drug dealing. At the time,
Harper was in- carcerated and awaiting sentencing for six prior armed
robberies. While on release, he committed an additional sixteen armed
robberies and shot two people.33 Informants who expect to be forgiven
for their crimes can pose spe- cial threats to friends and families. In
Tampa, Florida, police permitted their informant to use his
government-issued cell phone to "scheme\[\] to steal property and beat
up his friends. While his police handlers lis- tened in and looked the
other way, he threatened to beat the mother of his child so badly 'that
her brain will seep from her ears.'"34 One of the dealer-informants in
Mount Vernon had a string of domestic vio- lence convictions for choking
and assault, even as police let him evade arrest for his drug business.
A former prosecutor flagged the risks of using informants involved in
domestic violence. "It's natural to feel that you're emboldened by this
because you have the backing of the police and they're going to help you
if you get stuck in a situation," he said. "It's potentially very
dangerous for everyone in that household or in that relationship."35 In
his classic study of police practices in a typical midsized Ameri- can
city, Professor Jerome Skolnick concluded that, as a general mat- ter,
"burglary detectives permit informants to commit narcotics offenses,
while narcotics detectives allow informants to steal."36 More generally,
sociological studies find that police assume and know that their infor-
mants commit unauthorized crimes. One study described a St. Louis street
snitch who "stayed out of sight for several days after giving infor-
mation to the police," since snitching had permitted him to escape his
"third weapons charge \[and\] he reasoned \[that his\] quick appearance
almost certainly would indicate that he had snitched in exchange for his
freedom."37 Finally, every time police reward a person with a substance
use dis- order with cash for drugs (or sometimes actual drugs), they
enable that informant's continued illegal drug use and dependence. As
one officer acknowledged: Payment to addict-informants puts the officer
in something of a moral quandary. We can be reasonably certain that
monies given to an addicted person are going to be used to support that
addiction. Because the ad- diction can only be maintained by violating
the law, this places the of- ficer in the position of tolerating or at
least knowing of ongoing criminal activity---something we are paid to
stop.38 Of course not all informants commit new crimes, authorized or
unau- thorized. Some simply provide information about past crimes and
hope for reduced punishment for what they've already done. But active
infor- mants populate a gray world of continuing criminal activity, in
which some crime is openly encouraged by the government, some crime is
tolerated or ignored, and some is never discovered. These new crimes
typically occur in the communities in which informants live, forcing
friends, families, residents, and businesses to contend with higher
inci- dents of drug use and drug dealing, violence, weapons, thefts, and
the myriad other offenses that informants commit while working for the
government. III. More Violence In 1996, the criminologist Dr. Jerome
Miller explained how using [infor- mants exacerbates violence in urban
communities. Not only do [snitches]{.mark} commit crimes themselves, but
they [**erode** social]{.mark} mechanisms for keeping the peace by
creating dis[trust]{.mark} [and inviting
retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Dr. Miller put it: [[No single
tactic]{.mark} of law enforcement has [contributed more to
violence]{.mark} in the inner city [than]{.mark} the practice of seeding
the streets with [informers]{.mark} and offering deals to
"snitches]{.underline}." . . . \[[R\]elying on [informers]{.mark}
**[threatens]{.mark}** and]{.underline} eventually
[cripples]{.underline} much more than criminal enterprise. It erodes
what- ever [**[social bonds]{.mark}** exist [in]{.mark} families, in the
[community]{.mark}, or on the streets--- [loyalties which, in past
years, kept violence within bounds]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 Ten years
later, sociologists confirmed this observation. Richard Rosenfeld, Bruce
Jacobs, and Richard Wright wrote that police snitching tactics
"contribute to the violence in already dangerous communities." Their
street-level studies of police and informant behavior revealed that,
[because criminals cannot trust each other, "[dependence on firearms is
likely to rise; without accomplices]{.mark}, guns become the
backup]{.underline}." More generally, "\[[t\]he practice undermines
trust and **breaks apart** communi- ties. [It erodes faith in
official]{.mark} [authorities]{.mark}. [It foments
**retaliation**]{.mark}, [which **ignites**]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[street]{.mark}-level microstructure [in]{.mark} potentially deadly
**[conflict spi- rals]{.mark}**."]{.underline} They concluded that
"snitching is a pervasive element of inner-city street life that poses
dangers for street criminals and law-abiding resi- dents alike."40
[[Gangs]{.mark} and other criminal organizations famously [use violence
to deter snitching]{.mark}.]{.underline} Researchers in organizational
science have long recog- nized that [deploying informants in any
organization can be expected to lead to violence, as the organization
responds by trying [to police itself]{.mark} more firmly]{.underline}.41
Government studies found that [the spike in witness in- timidation in
the mid-1990s was directly linked to increased gang activ- ity and was
most prevalent in connection with violent crime]{.underline}.42 Even
more specifically, [studies]{.underline} of violence in the drug trade
[identify the "elim- ination of informers" as a structural source of
ongoing violence.]{.underline}43 The death of sixteen-year-old Martha
Puebla exemplifies the violent side effects of snitching policies. In an
effort to obtain a confession, Los Angeles police lied to a gang member
and told him that Puebla was in- forming on him. This misrepresentation
led not to a confession but to Puebla's murder.44 Likewise, when police
in Brea, California, turned seventeen-year- old Chad MacDonald into an
informant, it led not only to MacDonald's death but also to the rape and
shooting of his sixteen- year-old girlfriend by gang members against
whom MacDonald was informing.45 This book contains numerous stories in
which the govern- ment's decision to use informants has meant tolerating
violence against others---from the death of Kathryn Johnston in Atlanta
to Karen Park- er's childhood of sexual abuse at the hands of con man
Paul Skalnik. In other words, [when government officials turn to
criminal informants as a law enforcement tool, they should expect to
provoke more violence in the communities most affected by those
tactics]{.underline}. [Because fear and vio- lence constitute some of
the most devastating aspects of impoverished urban life, this particular
effect of snitching policies is one of the most costly]{.underline}. IV.

INTRODUCTION On May 7, 2008, Rachel Morningstar Hoffman, a twenty-
three-year-old Tallahassee resident and recent graduate of Florida State
University, disappeared while trying to purchase 1500 pills of ecstasy,
two-and-a-half ounces of cocaine, and a handgun for \$13,000 from two
suspected drug dealers.\' Two days later, the Tallahassee Police
Department (\"TPD\") arrested the dealers, Andrea Green and Deneilo
Bradshaw, who led police to Hoffman\'s body. 2 Hoffman had been shot and
her body dumped in a rural area outside of the city. 3 The swift
apprehension of Bradshaw and Green might, at first glance, appear to be
an example of efficient police work. But in fact, [the TPD were
intimately involved in the events that led to her death]{.underline}, as
[Hoffman was a confidential informant who set up the deal at the TPD\'s
express direction and under threat of criminal
prosecution]{.underline}.4 Three weeks before her death, the TPD
searched Hoffman\'s apartment and found approximately five ounces of
marijuana, six ecstasy pills, and other drug paraphernalia. 5 The next
day, officers met with Hoffman and gave her a choice: [she could help
the TPD apprehend other drug dealers or face prosecution on multiple
felony charges]{.underline}. 6 The decision no doubt seemed simple to
Hoffman. The TPD told her that she only had to provide \"substantial
assistance\" or do \"one big deal\" to avoid charges and promised that
they would keep her safe.7 But if [she refused to cooperate, they
threatened significant prison time on multiple felony
charges]{.underline}, and these new charges would have made her
ineligible for drug court disposition of earlier marijuana possession
charges.\' Given her options, she agreed to cooperate with the TPD. 9
Hoffman\'s situation is typical of those faced by an increasing number
of civilians ° who assist police in exchange for leniency.\" She decided
to cooperate alone, without an opportunity to consult her attorney. 1 2
She lacked a meaningful understanding of the charges she could face as a
result of the drugs found in her apartment,13 or what she had to do in
order to receive leniency.14 Once recruited, she risked injury and death
to cooperate with the government 5 and did so with no training in
conducting undercover police operations or protecting herself from
harm.\'\" Hoffman\'s murder has become a flash point in the debate over
the use of confidential informants. 1 Local prosecutors and the ACLU
have questioned why the TPD did not notify the State Attorney\'s Office
about the drugs found during the April search or Hoffman\'s agreement to
cooperate, arguing that the failure to do so vested too much
unsupervised discretion with the police.\' 8 Hoffman\'s parents have
filed suit against the TPD, asserting negligence in the use of Rachel
Hoffman-a young woman with no experience in trafficking firearms or
cocaine-to purchase cocaine and a handgun, and have criticized the TPD
for not allowing her an opportunity to consult an attorney. 19 A grand
jury investigation of Hoffman\'s death concluded that \"negligent
conduct on the part of the Tallahassee Police Department and D.E.A.
\[contributed to Ms. Hoffman\'s death.\" 20 Meanwhile, Professor
Alexandra Natapoff contends that the Hoffman case shows that police are
not properly held accountable for their use of confidential informants
and that their use is not sufficiently transparent. 2 \' These
criticisms, however, miss the forest for the trees. They focus on
symptomatic flaws in the TPD\'s handling of Hoffman while failing to
appreciate a fundamental constitutional violation inherent in the
relationship between the state and informants like Hoffman.2 2 [By
forcing Hoffman to decide between working for the state and facing
criminal prosecution, the TPD compelled her to make a choice
that]{.underline}, in a practical and constitutional sense, [was no
choice at all]{.underline}. [An informant]{.underline} who agrees to
cooperate when faced with such a dilemma [is subjected to a condition of
involuntary servitude prohibited by]{.underline} the express terms of
[the **Thirteenth Amendment**]{.underline}. 23 Since as early as the
1970s, commentators have argued that the Thirteenth Amendment applies in
the informant context.24 However, the application of the Thirteenth
Amendment to the use of confidential informants should be revisited for
a number of reasons. First, in the intervening decades, the Supreme
Court has clarified the Amendment\'s scope and Congress has passed broad
enforcement legislation, thus strengthening the legal argument for using
the Amendment to regulate the state-informant relationship.2 5 Second,
scholars have begun to examine the use of informants in more depth,
raising practical, structural, and normative concerns that the
application of the Thirteenth Amendment would specifically address. 26
Third, no one has adequately addressed the dissonance between the
Thirteenth Amendment\'s historical context and the modern use of
confidential informants; earlier discussions have instead focused
primarily on potential practical implications of applying the Thirteenth
Amendment to the relationship between the state and confidential
informants.2 7 Finally, the last thirty years have seen renewed interest
in exploring the Thirteenth Amendment\'s potential reach.28 Scholars
have argued that the Amendment can protect, among others, children
abused by their parents, 29 battered women,30 prostitutes,3 \'
bankruptcy debtors,32 women seeking an abortion,33 and victims of sexual
harassment,3 among others.35 In response, critics have suggested that a
careless expansion of the Thirteenth Amendment could have unintended and
undesirable consequences, 36 and that such expansion without
consideration of the Amendment\'s history and context, weakens the moral
force of its blanket prohibition on slavery and involuntary servitude.37
In light of these concerns, this article asserts that the Thirteenth
Amendment constrains the state-informant relationship, and provides
legal, historical, and practical support for this argument. Part I lays
out a brief history of informant use, defines the state-informant
relationships relevant to the Thirteenth Amendment analysis, and
describes the current model for handling informants like Rachel Hoffman.
Part II discusses the original purposes of the Thirteenth Amendment and
the Supreme Court\'s application of the Amendment in the involuntary

Amendment to the state-informant relationship and addresses the most
apparent legal and historical criticisms of that application. Part IV
sets forth a new model for the use of informants that complies with the
Thirteenth Amendment. Part V discusses the Thirteenth Amendment\'s
possible impact on criminal investigation and prosecution in light of
this new model. Finally, Part VI explains how applying the Thirteenth

After elucidating the mechanics of this bizarre arrangement, Anan
discloses that the Enterprise was destroyed by a Vendikan attack (second
flash) and urges Kirk to order his crew to report for execution.8 7 Kirk
emphatically refuses, declining to even entertain further discussion.8 8
Appalled, Anan commands an Eminian soldier to lock the Away Team in a
secure room, which is to be put under constant surveillance.89 To keep a
long story short, the Away Team manages to escape, capture the High
Council, and take control of the command center.9 Kirk then delivers the
following speech: \"[Death, destruction, disease, horror]{.underline}.
That\'s what war is all about \.... That\'s what makes it a thing to be
avoided. [You\'ve made it \... \[s\]o neat and painless, you\'ve had no
reason to stop it]{.underline}. And you\'ve had it for five hundred
years. Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and my ship,
I\'m going to end it for you, one way or another.\" 91 He then uses his
phaser to irreparably destroy the computers.92 Anan bellows, \"You
realize what you have done?\"93 Kirk replies affirmatively and advises
the Emin- ians that they only have two remaining options: start building
bombs or attempt to negotiate peace. 94 Kirk and the Enterprisethen
begin their journey home, but Ambassador Fox stays behind to assist the
Eminians through the peace process. 95 A few weeks later, the
Enterprisereceives a message from the Ambassador relaying the good
news-a truce had been called and negotiations were underway. 96 Spock,
noticing a smug look on Kirk\'s face, comments, \"Captain, you took a
big chance.\"9 Kirk quickly dismisses the suggestion, pointing out that
while physical bombs are no more deadly than simulated ones, real war
eventually has to end.98 II. SANITIZATION OF VIOLENCE The \"virtual\"
war fought in \"[A Taste for Armageddon]{.underline}\" can be understood
as a dystopian critique of a particular orientation to violence. More
specifically, it [stands in opposition to the view that violence is
somehow more virtuous or acceptable once anesthetized]{.underline}. Not
to be confused with a call for unrestrained warfare, the episode serves
as [a [caution]{.mark}ary tale [against equating civility with
humaneness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the storyline most directly
relates to issues of wartime ethics, \"[A Taste of
Armageddon]{.underline}\" can be [understood]{.underline} more generally
[as metacritique of [the **sanitization of
violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or as a noun, sanitized violence):
\"sanitization,\" defined as the process of making an act more
acceptable or less objectionable by dulling unpleasant features; 99 and
\"vio- lence,\" being the intentional infliction of emotional,
psychological, or physical in- jury.10 0 [Sanitization]{.underline},
whether deliberate or inadvertent, [[promotes **complacency** through
the neutralization of **moral outrage**-the primary]{.mark}
[**instigating** force]{.mark} and catalyst [for]{.mark} public
[opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 01 [Four]{.underline} common
sanitization [techniques]{.underline}, which are present
[in]{.underline} both \"A Taste for Armageddon\" and [the plea bargain
regime]{.underline}, [include]{.underline}: (1) [misapplication of
economic and utilitarian principles]{.underline}; (2) [overemphasis on
the mini- mization of physical pain and unpleasantness]{.underline}; (3)
[obfuscation of the act, pushing its view to society\'s
periphery]{.underline}; and (4) [manufacturing of consent]{.underline}
A. Useful Backgroundllnformation 1. Definition of \"Violence\" Notably,
while the term \"violence\" is traditionally reserved for physical
assaults, I interpret it to include all deliberate acts that knowingly
cause injury.10 2 I believe [a narrow understanding of violence is
problematic because it trivializes the effects of psychological and
emotional trauma-both of which can be as deleterious to human health as
a physical attack]{.underline}. 11 3 From this perspective, I argue
[[incarceration]{.mark} ought to be considered a violent
act]{.underline}.10 4 First, [it [**axiomatically** causes injury by
**encumbering**]{.mark} freedom and [liberty]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 5
Second, [[inmates are]{.mark} often [subjected to repeated physical and
**sexual** **abuse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 6 And finally,
[[prison]{.mark} conditions can [induce]{.mark} **intense**
[psychological suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}-in some cases, [[resulting
in]{.mark} long-term [mental illness]{.mark}, such as chronic
[depression]{.mark}, a severely diminished sense of self-worth,
[and]{.mark} [p]{.mark}ost-[t]{.mark}raumatic [s]{.mark}tress
[d]{.mark}isorder]{.underline}l7 The negative effects of incarceration
are compounded in cases of injustice.\"\' [[Wrongfully convicted
defendants]{.mark} can [experience trauma]{.mark} [commensurate
to]{.mark} that of war veterans and **[torture
survivors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.109 Similarly, [when a
post-incarceration defendant is exonerated, victims of the original
crime may find themselves overcome with feelings of guilt, fear,
helplessness and devastation]{.underline}. 110 \"For some victims, [the
impact of the wrongful conviction may be comparable to-or even worse
than-that of their original victimization]{.underline}.\"11 1
[[Describing incarceration as]{.mark} [a non-violent act]{.mark}
**[white- washes]{.mark}** the psychological, physical, and personal
hardship regularly experienced by prisoners]{.underline}. Although in
some cases imprisonment may be morally justified, and even demanded,
[incarcerating a human being ought to be procedurally and substantively
difficult.]{.underline} 2. Review of the Literature The phrase
\"sanitization of violence\" (or \"sanitized violence\") is applied in
variety of contexts, most frequently in discussions about: (a) the
media\'s tendency to sim- plify and glorify acts of state sanctioned
violence112 , (b) the subtextual propagation of violent political
messages under the guise of \"innocence\" \'1 13 , and (c) cultural
efforts to regulate the portrayal of graphic imagery, such as gore and
blood.1 1 4 Yet, its characterization appears to be relatively
inconsistent and generally lacks specific definition. The concept of
sanitized violence, as I am using the phrase, is more consonant with the
work of Michel [Foucault]{.underline}, and particularly his book
Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prison (Discipline & Punish).115
Discipline & Punish is a genealogy of the evolution of punishment
spanning from public torture and execu- tions in late 18th Century
France to the modern western penal system.116 Foucault critiques the
view that prisons developed as a result of moral enlightenment; instead,
he [argues]{.underline} this transition merely reflects modern power
dynamics. 117 Foucault begins the book by discussing early methods of
punishment, which were conducted as brutal public spectacles.1 1 8 For
Foucault, like his predecessor Friedrich Nietzsche and his contemporary
followers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, the human body is the
primary site of production, domination, and socialization.11 9 Early
punishment acted as a deterrent to crime by creating an association
between criminal acts and physical pain.\"12 Thus, the visibility of
punishment was essential for accomplishing its real purpose-exerting
control over the social order, or what Foucault calls Discipline. 121 By
the late eighteenth century, industrialization and technological
development increased demand for skilled and specialized labor.122
Accordingly, [technologies of Discipline that solely compel complacency
were rendered inadequate]{.underline}.1 23 [The state needed bodies with
utility-trainable, manipulable, improvable, and transformable-
\"docile]{.underline}.\" \'124 Thus, came the advent and rise of
panopticism.125 The term is derived from Jeremy\' Bentham\'s proposed
prison design, the Panopticon, crafted to increase the efficiency of
prison surveillance. 12 6 Bentham believed that prisons could be made
more cost efficient by exploiting imbalances of knowledge.12 The basic
structure places a tower in the center of the prison complex such that
guards can surveil all prisoners from a single position.128 A one-way
screen is strategically placed, prevent- ing prisoners\' from viewing
what or who is inside. 129 Consequently, even in a guard\'s absence, the
prisoner would act as though they were under surveillance.130 Bentham
cited this phenomenon as the \"apparent omnipresence of the inspector.\"
\' 131 [Foucault says, \"the major effect of the Panopticon \[is\] to
induce in the inmate a state of conscious and permanent visibility that
assures the automatic functioning of]{.underline} \",132
[power]{.underline}. Foucault argues this
[surveillance]{.underline}-focused method of [discipline]{.underline}
has now [permeated]{.underline} [through]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
social stratus- connecting with a number of historical processes,
includ- ing economic, [juridco-poltical]{.underline}, and scientific.133
[Modern discipline, or \"[disciplinary power]{.mark}\", is therefore not
established through public spectacles, but \"in the shadows]{.underline}
according to criteria and with instruments that elude control.\"134
\"Instead of bend- ing all its subjects into a single uniform mass, [it
separates, analyses, differentiates, \[and\] carries its procedures of
decomposition to the point of necessary and sufficient single
units]{.underline}.\" 131 Applying Foucauldian principles, [plea
bargains are the ultimate panoptic instru- ments. [The state is no
longer required to prove guilt because defendants are]{.mark} [coerced
into policing themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just like the
invisibility of guards in the panoptic tower, [the uncertainty of
[trial]{.mark} and its accompanying disproportionate [punishment allows
pros- ecutors to make defendants **submit to their
will**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The plea bargain regime is, likewise, a
tool of disciplinary power, [[allowing for the]{.mark} autonomous
[individualization of punish- ment]{.mark} using criteria that is free
from scrutiny]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} prisoners\' [admission of
guilt]{.mark} in turn [**legitimizes** the state\'s exertion of
arbitrary power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Systematic
[inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}, as seen in racial sentencing
disparities, [[can be observed]{.underline}]{.mark}-serving a
disciplinary function over minorities-[[yet]{.mark} [cannot]{.mark}
[be]{.mark} specifically [identified]{.mark} and]{.underline},
therefore, [cannot be addressed]{.underline}. 136
[Sanitization]{.underline}, like panopticism, [can be understood as a
modality of disciplinary power]{.underline}. Although my conception of
sanitization does not necessitate a Foucauldian analysis, Foucault\'s
theory of power provides invaluable insight into how each of the four
processes operates. 137 Additionally, Discipline and Punish lays
critical ground- work for understanding the relationship between state
power and tolerance to pen- alty.138 Foucault and I diverge in respect
to the efficacy of reformism. 139 Although we are in agreement that the
legal system is riddled with problems,1 40 I am unaware of any
acceptable alternative. Moreover, 1,unlike Foucault, believe the
promotion of justice is both important, and when done right,
advantageous. 14 1 B. Economic and UtilitarianEfficiency Perpetrators of
sanitizedviolence (\"[[sanitizers]{.underline}]{.mark}\") often, whether
intentionally or unin- tentionally, [[deflect attacks
through]{.underline}]{.mark} equivocation and
[[abstraction]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Allegations]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} un- fairness and [**[unjustness]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} easily [[diverted to conversations
about]{.underline}]{.mark} the broader [[efficacy]{.underline}]{.mark}
of a particular political or philosophical ideology. [Sophisticated
actors]{.underline} can [miscon- strue legitimate and sensible
intellectual positions to serve as a defense for their nefarious
activities]{.underline}. A common instrument of this deception is the
invocation of [[economic]{.mark} and utilitarian
[principles]{.mark}]{.underline}. These concepts are powerful devices
for sanitiz- ers, because they: (1) [are exceedingly complicated, and
therefore difficult to combat,]{.underline} (2) [sufficiently malleable
to suit various purposes]{.underline}; (3) [are presumed to be entirely
objective processes; and]{.underline} (4) [subvert notions of human
emotion and intuition.]{.underline} 1. Defining and Understanding
\"Efficiency\" (a) Economic Efficiency. The term \"efficiency\" varies
from field to field and is dependent on the context in which it is used.
142 For economists, \"efficiency is a relationship between ends and
means.\" 143 Efficiency is frequently expressed in rela- tion to
monetary considerations, but for many economists, \"value\" and \"cost\"
can include any number of factors, such as time, effort, or sentimental
significance each worth what a person or entity deems them to be. 14 4
Similarly, economic effi- ciency is not restricted to measures of the
economy as a whole; it can be applied to an individual transaction, a
group of transactions, solely from the perspective of a single
individual, or from the perspective of multiple individuals-i.e.
society.1 45 Determining whether a transaction is efficient from the
perspective of any particu- lar individual is relatively easy. 146 More
often than not, it is unnecessary to translate costs and values into
quantifiable measures, since the evaluation is entirely self-
referential-one must only ask the relevant individual, what would you
prefer?147 Alternatively, economic efficiency models are more
complicated when applied to multiple parties and transactions. 148
First, what is economically beneficial for any given person may not be
for others. 149 Second, the interpersonal comparison of gain and loss is
an inherently subjective process.1 50 When values and costs are
qualitative in nature-e.g. freedom-economists must translate qualitative
information into numerical representations (\"quantification\"). 15 1
This translation requires subjective determinations, such as choosing
which variables and measurement tools to use. 152 Abstractly, it can be
simply said that the economy is efficient when \"every resource is
optimally allocated to serve each person in the best way while
minimizing waste and inefficiency\"\'1 53 However, efficiency can be
defined only in relation to a pre- determined goal, and it is not
obvious what the objective for economic efficiency should be.154
[Economic calculus is]{.underline} often **[fraudulently]{.underline}**
[characterized as an entirely neutral and objective
science.]{.underline}15 5 [This [veil of objectivity]{.mark} [can
be]{.mark} extremely dangerous-at [a]{.mark} minimum, an impediment to
critical examination, or more omi- nously, a [tool for
**manipulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}1 56 (b) UtilitarianEfficiency.
Utilitarianism is a subset of consequentialism, a class of normative
ethics roughly defined as the philosophical position that ethical
decisions should be evaluated solely on their material consequences. 1
57 Utilitarians generally share the common position that the most moral
action is the one producing the greatest utility for the greatest number
of people.1 58 Utilitarianism and economic efficiency theory overlap in
many respects, but nonetheless have important differ- ences. 159 Most
notably, utilitarianism is categorically concerned with normative eth-
ics, 16 while economists disagree over the role of normative claims in
the field of economics, if any at all. 16 1 Judge Posner, in his famous
book The Economics ofJustice, makes a more aggres- sive claim,
contending that normative economics and utilitarianism are fundamen-
tally heterogeneous. 162 His primary argument is that while
utilitarianism is concerned with promoting the surplus of pleasure over
pain, normative economics is interested in the singular goal of wealth
maximization. Problematically, his delineation is entirely self-serving.
164 He uses an overly simplistic definition of utilitarianism, which at
best is applicable to classical utilitarians-e.g. John Stewart Mill and
Jeremy Bentham-but is more aptly suited to describe hedonism.16 5
Utilitarianism should be more broadly understood as the normative
prioritization of utility, which for some utilitarians is measured by
pleasure and pain.16 6 There is no credible basis for assert- ing that
utilitarianism categorically excludes wealth maximization as a measure
of utility. 167 Similarly, Judge Posner implicitly claims, erroneously,
that all normative economists believe wealth maximization ought to be
the singular goal of economics. 168 Importantly, [utilitarianism
is]{.underline} potentially [**dangerous** in]{.underline} many of [the
same ways as economic efficiency theory]{.underline}. First, it is
sufficiently complicated, consisting of many different forms, rendering
it amenable to manipulation. 169 Second, utility, in both fields, is
exceedingly difficult to define, leaving room for the exploitation of
its ambiguities. 170 Third, utilitarianism is commonly mischaracterized
as an entirely objective science; but as is the case in economics, it
requires subjective decision- making when weighing probabilities and
selecting measurement methodologies. 1 1 2. \"Efficiency\" and the Plea
Bargain Regime This article should not be read as an attempt to
discredit economics or utilitarianism-both of which have extremely
valuable applications. Rather, I pro-vide a specific and narrow
[indict]{.underline}ment of [their imprudent use,
including]{.underline}: (1) [making unfounded and wide-sweeping
claims]{.underline}; (2) [arbitrarily excluding relevant intangible
considerations]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} (3) [posing as an
entirely objective science]{.underline}. Economics and utilitari- anism
merely provide decision-making tools that are, by themselves, incapable
of providing normative guidance.1\"2 In the language of efficiency
theory, they are but the means to an end[. [We must resist the
**compulsion** to **fetishize**]{.mark} neatness and
[quantifiability]{.mark}; otherwise [we run \"a]{.mark} very real [risk
of **inhumanity**]{.mark}-[of maximizing]{.mark} a sterile and
behaviorally [defined value]{.mark} [without regard
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the organic, [[lived conse- quences]{.mark}
of]{.underline} legal or moral [decision-making]{.underline}.\" 173
Sadly, I believe such caution was not taken when crafting the plea
bargain regime. 174 (a) The Price of so-called \"Efficiency\" Unlike the
expansive rules, regulations and laws applied to criminal trials,
[plea-bargaining is approached with a **laissez-faire**
attitude]{.underline}. 17 1 While trial preparation typically includes
various fact-finding exercises (e.g. Discovery), plea-bargains rarely,
if ever, involve comparable attention to de- tail.176 Congress\'
involvement with the regime has been almost entirely formalistic, e.g.
prohibiting judges from participating in negotiations as opposed to
creating substantive regulations.1 7 7 These **[[shortcuts are not
without consequence]{.underline}]{.mark}**-[each in- creases the
likelihood that misinformation affects the disposition of a
case]{.underline}. 1 78 Giving similar cause for concern, the Supreme
Court in United States v. Ruiz unanimously held that prosecutors are
permitted to require defendants to waive their right to impeachment
information, as well as their right to appeal if such information comes
to light. 17\' Therefore, [a defendant may be coerced into a plea deal
on the basis of fraudulent witness testimony, prosecutors can knowingly
conceal information exposing this fact, and defendants are without
meaningful judicial recourse]{.underline}.180 The Court reasoned that
while trial procedures are judged on the standard of fairness, the
proper inquiry for plea bargains is voluntariness (discussed further in
part E, manufac- turing of consent).18 1 The Court goes on to justify
this counter-intuitive position by stating, \"a constitutional
obligation to provide impeachment information during plea bargaining
\... could seriously interfere with the Government\'s interest in secur-
ing those guilty pleas that are factually justified, desired by
defendants, and help to secure the efficient administration of
justice.\"\"\' (b) But What about Frye and Lafler? Arguably, the most
meaningful protection afforded to criminal defendants during the plea
process is the result of two Supreme Court companion cases, Missouri v.
Frye 83 and Lafler v. Cooper184 , each five-four decisions. Both cases
broaden the scope of Strickland v. Washington, which estab- lished the
standard for overturning criminal convictions on the basis of
ineffective assistance of counsel.185 Under Strickland, to prevail on an
infective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must prove: (1)
defense counsel\'s representation fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness (\"performance prong\"); and (2) a reasonable probability
that but for this failure, the results of the proceedings would have
been different (\"prejudice prong\").186 In Frye, the Court imposed a
\"duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecu- tion to accept a
plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the ac- cused
\.... 18 Thus, defense counsel\'s failure to notify their client about
the availability of a plea offer before its expiration presumptively
satisfies the perfor- mance prong of the Stricklandtest.188 In Lafler
the Court held that a defendant could seek relief if ineffective counsel
both led to the rejection of a plea and resulted in a relatively harsher
sentence at trial.18 9 Unlike Frye, defendants still carry the burden of
proving the first prong of the Stricklandtest-failure to meet an
objective standard of reasonableness.19 ° Note, under either case,
relief will not be granted unless the defendant can sufficiently meet
the requirements of the second prong. 191 Thus, in cases where an
attorney failed to inform their client about the availability of a plea
offer, to succeed on a an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,
defendants must prove: (1) \"a reasonable probability they would have
accepted \[it\]\"; and if \"the prosecution had the discretion to cancel
it or if the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it,\"
then (2) \"there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor
the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or
imple- mented.\" 192 When a defendant rejects a plea offer on the advice
of counsel, the defendant must prove: (1) \"but for the ineffective
advice \... there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would
have been presented to the court (i.e., that the defendant would have
accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have with- drawn it in
light of intervening circumstances)\"; (2) \"that the court would have
accepted its terms\"; and (3) \"that the conviction or sentence, or
both, under the offer\'s terms would have been less severe than under
the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.\"\' 19 3
Plea-bargain reformers are divided as to the significance of these two
decisions.194 My position is that, although a step in the right
direction, neither offers relief from the regime\'s greatest ills.
First, overturning a conviction merely places the defendant back into
the plea-bargain system. 195 Second, neither has an impact on the
pervasive- ness of plea-bargains generally.1 96 Third, they do address
the economic or cultural drivers of \"**[[meet em\' and plead
em]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"\' and, accordingly, maintain the de facto
policy of mass incarceration. 197 Some commentators take an even more
critical position, argu- ing that these cases [actively [encourage
**unscrupulous** plea-bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}, given that both
[decisions impose duties directionally geared towards advising
defendants to take a plea-deal]{.underline}. 198 Finally, Fye and Lafler
leave intact the four processes of sanitization critiqued in this paper,
as evidenced by Justice Scalia\'s dissenting opinions.1 99 In both
dissents, Justice Scalia\'s primary argument-aside from insisting the
major- ity decisions lack constitutional foundation-is that [there is no
logical reason to protect defendants from ill-advised or uninformed plea
rejections given that a defen- dant has no constitutional right to a
plea-bargain in the first place]{.underline}.2\"\' On a surface level,
this is perfectly rational. Nevertheless[, it implicitly relies on the
faulty premise that the trial system and plea bargain regime operate
independently]{.underline}.2\"1 In reality, [sentencing guidelines
implicitly account for penalty reductions that result from plea-
bargaining]{.underline}.2\"2 Problematically, this means [that if
defendants invoke their constitu- tional right to a trial, they face an
artificially high penalty]{.underline}.2 ° 3 \"Many have surmised that
the larger the sentencing differential, the greater likelihood a
defendant will forego his or her right to trial and accept the deal.\"
20 4 Proof of this scheme can be deduced through elementary logic.
First, we should take as an assumption that sentencing lengths are
intended to serve some legitimate purpose-e.g. deterrence,
rehabilitation, or retribution.20 5 The alternative would be to
authorize incarceration on an entirely arbitrary basis, which is more
akin to slavery than criminal justice.20 6 If we accept this as true,
then why would society allow criminal penalties to be reduced at all?20
7 Proponents of the plea bargain regime argue that this sacrifice simply
reflects a compromise between two competing objectives-justice and
efficiency. 208 But the proposition that these concerns are meaningfully
balanced collapses under inspection. First, [the fact that plea deals
represent **ninety-five percent** of convictions is strong evidence that
[efficiency consid- erations have been elevated above]{.mark} fairness
and [justice]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 9 Second, plea bargains do not
typically involve a minor sentence reduction; rather, they are most
often dra- matic. 210 For example, \"\[\]n 2012, the average sentence of
federal drug offenders convicted after trial was three times higher (16
years) than that received after a guilty plea (5 years and 4 months).
\'2 11 Finally, the plea bargain regime actively encourages defendants
to think like economists, weighing risks and probabilities, rather than
to seek an outcome most in line with truth and justice. 12 3. Conclusion
[[Proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of the regime have [[defended its
merits by **improperly** invoking]{.mark} no- tions of economic and
utilitarian [efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[if]{.mark}
truth, fairness, and [justice are]{.mark} essential [goals]{.mark} of
the criminal justice system, [plea-bargaining has proven to be]{.mark}
exceedingly [inefficient]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 13 And thus, [[its
proponents]{.underline}]{.mark}, either consciously or uncon- sciously,
[[rely on a hidden]{.mark} and dangerous [belief]{.mark}, [that **none**
of those things matter]{.mark}]{.underline}. C. Minimization of Pain and
Unpleasantness

#### Mass incarceration and state racial violence is rationalized and obfuscated via plea bargaining -- it avoids penal consciousness and direct consequences

C. Minimization of Pain and Unpleasantness [A powerful sanitization
tactic is to minimize the pain and unpleasantness experi- enced by the
perpetrator\'s victims]{.underline}. [[Minimization can
be]{.underline}]{.mark}: real, a reduction or elimina- tion of painful
and unpleasant features; discursive, [[the rationalization of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark} through the invocation of logically
fallacious reasoning or exploitation of linguistic ambiguity; or
illusory, the propagation of distorted beliefs about the severity of
suffering being inflicted. [[Sanitizers often avoid discussing an act\'s
justifiability]{.underline}]{.mark} [in absolute terms]{.underline},
instead, [[diverting the conversation to]{.mark} a relative comparison
of what was done versus [what could have been done]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This approach to ethics is ill-advised, to say the least. First, [it
authorizes nearly any violent act because, almost always, it is possible
to identify a more abhorrent alternative]{.underline}. Second, it is
logically indefensible. Granted, in order to determine the preferability
of a course of action, a comparative inquiry is required, i.e. we ought
to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each available option.
Nonetheless, it is not the case that a choice is good simply because it
is less bad than other alternatives.2 14 A good example of minimization
is the Supreme Court\'s analysis in Baze v. Rees.2 1 5 The Court held
that, under the Eighth Amendment, a method of lethal injection is not
cruel and unusual unless there is an \"objectively intolerable risk of
harm. \'2 16 The Court further ruled that \"an isolated mishap alone
does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation, precisely because
such an event, while regret- table, does not suggest cruelty \.... 217
This discourse is sanitizing in a number of respects: (1) describing an
excruciatingly painful death as a \"mishap\"; (2) positing that
something is not cruel simply because it was an \"accident\"; (3)
implicitly expand- ing the definition of \"accident\" to be inclusive of
foreseeable and avoidable conse- quences; (4) using \"objectively\" in
conjunction with \"intolerable risk\", even though tolerance is
definitionally a subjective determination; and (5) describing \"harm\"
to describe physical pain but not death. Additionally, consider the
Court\'s statement that \"it is difficult to regard a practice as
\'objectively intolerable\' when it is in fact widely tolerated.\" \'2
18 In other words, the Court takes the tautological position that a
method of execution is neither cruel nor unusual if it does not offend
society\'s sensibilities. In duplicitous fashion, the Court notes that
while this \"heavy burden\" is not insurmountable, it has never found an
execution technique to be cruel and unusual.2 19 The decision concludes
with an eerie attempt to offer comforting words: \"Our society has \...
steadily moved to more humane methods of carrying out capital
punishment. The firing squad, hanging, the electric chair, and the gas
chamber have each in turn given way to more humane methods, culminating
in today\'s consensus on lethal injection.\"2 2 ° Foucault says that
[lethal injection is legitimized through the double process of the
decline of the spectacle and reduction of pain]{.underline}.22 1 \"Today
a doctor must watch over those condemned to death, right up to the last
moment-thus juxtaposing himself as the agent of welfare, as the
alleviator of pain, with the official whose task it is to end life.\"
\'2 22 [We make killing more \"tolerable\" through the relative
reduction of pain, but]{.underline} as the Court analysis illustrates,
[this]{.underline} reduction, in reality, [is merely a
**pretext**]{.underline}. [[The plea bargain]{.mark} regime [is
justified]{.mark} in a similar fashion, claimed to mercifully spare
defendants from the pains and anxieties of trial while [granting them
relief from a worse]{.mark}, [but \"deserved\",
fate]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 3 Yet, plea bargains in the aggregate are
bad for criminal defendants.224 First, the [[plea]{.mark}
[bargain]{.mark} regime has driven the establishment of artificially
high criminal penalties]{.underline}, thus, functionally [[**eroding**
the]{.mark} constitutional [right to a]{.mark} jury
[trial]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 5 And second, [the plea bargain regime is
[a **pipeline** for **mass incarcera- tion**]{.mark}, [making it
possible to]{.mark} systematically [imprison
**millions**]{.mark}]{.underline} for non-violent and 226 minor drug
offenses. If prosecutors were required to go to trial to secure
convictions, the vast majority of low-level crimes would not be
prosecuted.22 The Supreme Court in Santobello v. New York explicitly
recognized this reality, commenting that, absent plea bargains, the
federal government would need to multiply, by many times, the number of
judges and court facilities. 228 Nevertheless, [[it]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
unlikely that the elimination of plea-bargaining would result in such an
expansion given how [unpopular]{.mark} it would be
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} (a) [substantially [enlarge tax]{.mark}payer
[burden and]{.mark}]{.underline} (b) [dramatically [increase the fre-
quency of jury service]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [[by making society
**internalize the cost** of incarceration]{.mark}, financially and
personally, [society would be incentivized to]{.mark} critically examine
crimi- nal penalties-likely resulting in greater demand for
[reform]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 9 D. Obfuscation oftheAct Perhaps
Foucault\'s greatest contribution to my conception of sanitization is in
relation to obfuscation. Foucault argues that \"\[s\]ecret punishments
and punishments not specific in the legal code, a power to punish
exercised in the shadows according to criteria and with instruments that
elude control \...\[is\] enough to compromise the whole strategy of\...
reform. 23\" Hence, [the power of the government to apply criminal
penalties in such a manner allows it to inflict punishment despotically
and arbitrarily]{.underline}.23 1 As discussed in the introduction,
prosecutorial discretion is near absolute-allowing for the disparate
treatment of defendants for unknowable and 232 unreviewable reasons.
[[Plea bargains **obfuscate** the violence of
incarceration]{.underline}]{.mark} in three ways. First, [[it]{.mark}
quite literally [removes the act from public view]{.mark}]{.underline}.2
33 [[Excluding outsiders]{.mark} from the process [reduces the
frequency]{.mark} in which [Americans think about incarceration]{.mark}
and limits]{.underline} 234 [[exposure]{.mark} to experiential evidence
that [may challenge the dominant narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Secondly, [even]{.underline} [insiders become less intimately
involved]{.underline} with the process [by substan- tially constraining
defendant interaction with prosecutors, defense attorneys, and
judges]{.underline}. 23 5 Taken together, [resistance to mass
incarceration is unable to gain momen- tum, because]{.underline} for the
vast majority of Americans, [[the human element]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the penal system [[is kept **out of sight** and **out of
mind**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, [[plea bargains produce]{.mark}
far [less detailed]{.mark} [documentation]{.mark} as compared to
trials]{.underline}, and what [[record]{.underline}]{.mark} is
maintained [[tends to be]{.mark} fairly **[one
sided]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 236 [This acts]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} yet [a]{.underline}nother [obstacle for
reform]{.underline} movements given that it makes it difficult, and
sometimes impossible, to prove innocence at after the fact.23
Additionally, in terms of racial disparities in sentencing,
[[plea-bargaining]{.mark} effec- tively **[conceals]{.mark}** all direct
[evidence]{.mark} [of]{.mark} racially motivated
[discrimination]{.mark}, because]{.underline}: (a) [prosecutors can
offer minority defendants worse plea deals without review]{.underline};
(b) [the failure to preserve counter-evidence makes it more difficult to
prove discrimination occurred in the first place; and]{.underline} (c)
[lack of public interaction with the criminal justice system allows
myths about racial differences in criminality to be
maintained]{.underline}.2 38 Accordingly, [[the
elimination]{.underline}]{.mark} or substantial reduction [[of
plea-bargaining would]{.underline}]{.mark} go a long way to [[disrupt
the]{.mark} [**stranglehold** of institutional racism on minority
populations]{.mark}]{.underline}. As previously discussed,
[[without]{.mark} the availability of [plea bargains]{.mark}, the
prosecution of low-level drugs crimes, the primary mechanism for [mass
incarceration]{.mark}, [would be]{.mark}- come virtually
**[non-existent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2 39 This would not only directly
benefit people of color by [removing a significant driver of racial
inequality]{.underline}, but [it would]{.underline} also have the
cyclical effect of [reducing racialized views about criminal
behavior]{.underline}. Obfuscation, although arguably the simplest
processes of sanitization,is one of the most insidious. Falsities
perpetuated by the other three processes can at least be combated
through diligent attacks. [[Obfuscation]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[suppresses]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}
entirely. E. Manufacturingof Consent

#### No pretrial detention link turns -- the ease of assembly line justice via guilty pleas causes the presumption of guilt that encourages preemptive punishment in jails.

The justices overruled the trial court and released the defendant, who
had already spent more than two years awaiting trial. Judges' fears
about losing electronics are not unfounded. There are many examples of
criminal justice decisions in favor of defendants being used as a wedge
issue in judicial elections. But I think there is another reason, too:
[[judges no longer think trials]{.mark} [are necessary]{.mark} in order
[to impose punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Because]{.mark} most
[defendants plead guilty]{.mark}, [trials are no longer]{.mark} [the
**defining** **moment**]{.mark} [when]{.mark} a defendant's [guilt is
established]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [**[guilt is]{.mark}**
basically **[presumed]{.mark}** in most cases, and the defendant
entering [a guilty plea is]{.mark} just [a **formality**]{.mark} that
has to be observed. [The idea that]{.mark} a guilty plea is just a
formality may also [explain why judges are]{.mark} so
[comfortable]{.mark} "[counting]{.mark}" [the time served before a
conviction as part of a defendant's punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[because]{.underline} [[judges]{.underline}]{.mark} are told that they
can [make a quick and informal decision themselves about guilt at the
bail hearing, they [may be **refusing to release** defendants
because]{.mark} [they've]{.mark} **[already made up their
minds]{.mark}** that those [defendants are guilty]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[If [judges]{.mark}]{.underline} already [presume that defendants are
guilty, then it shouldn't surprise us to see them [using]{.mark} [bail
and pretrial detention]{.mark} as a way [to punish]{.mark} those
[defendants]{.mark} [before trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the
judges in Houston, Texas, admitted that he and the other
[judges]{.underline} in his courthouse had been [using bail as a way to
punish people if they showed up late to court]{.underline}. "You come in
late? [I was]{.underline} doubling, **[tripling]{.underline}**
[bonds]{.underline}," he said. "[Bond was]{.underline} a way to punish
people. It's [like a whooping]{.underline}. 'Go get the belt. You get
three licks.' " This doesn't just happen in Texas. A study of a
Connecticut court found that [police would use their power over bail to
ensure]{.underline} that some [defendants spent at least some time
incarcerated. If a defendant was belligerent when the police interviewed
him, the police would sometimes incarcerate the defendant to "teach him
a lesson]{.underline}" or until he calmed down. Police would do this
[by]{.underline} initially [setting a high bail]{.underline}, requiring
the defendant to come up with a large amount of money in order to be
released, and then reducing the amount of bail eight or twelve hours
later. In other words, [judges and law enforcement know that pretrial
detention is no different from actual punishment]{.underline}. And so
[they intentionally use it to punish people for behavior that they find
annoying or disrespectful, even if it isn't a crime]{.underline}. Those
of us who care about [[plea bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark} can't
overlook the [**[central]{.underline}** **[role]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[that pretrial detention plays in the modern criminal justice
system]{.underline}. [People]{.underline} who are [detained before
trial]{.underline}---people like José and like Elizabeth's clients in
Houston---often [plead guilty because that is the only way that they can
leave jail and go home]{.underline}. [If they insist on their
innocence]{.underline}, [then]{.underline} [they]{.underline} have to
[stay in jail for weeks or **months** waiting for a trial]{.underline}.
There are a lot of people in this situation. A recent study by
researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's law school found that
[people charged with misdemeanors were 25 percent more likely to plead
guilty if they were detained pretrial than if they were
released]{.underline}. More important, [[when defendants]{.mark} accused
of minor crimes [are offered plea bargains for "time served]{.mark}," it
shows]{.underline} that the legal arguments judges tell
[[us]{.mark}]{.underline} about detention being different from
punishment are really just lies. [**[Detention is no different
from]{.mark} [punishment]{.mark}**. So we shouldn't be surprised when
police and judges use detention to punish people---people who are
supposedly innocent until and unless proven guilty]{.underline}. And we
shouldn't be surprised to see defendants pleading guilty just in order
to escape jail. [[They are already being punished, so they may as
well]{.mark} just [get]{.mark} the formality of [the]{.mark} guilty
[plea over with]{.mark}]{.underline}. CHAPTER FIVE LEGAL THEFT

I should pause briefly to explain how I will contrast democracy and
antide- mocracy in this Book Review. Democracy, broadly considered, is
the ability of the people to participate meaningfully as equals in the
decisions that shape their lives.16 Democracy is necessarily more than
simply voting and taking the preferences of majorities as law, as
democracy's commitment to political equality demands some measure of
respect for minority positions.17 To preserve a de- mocracy, the people
must remain vigilant against the creep of oligarchy and re- tain some
mechanism to wrest control when power becomes too concentrated.18
Antidemocracy, by contrast, seeks to accelerate and solidify this
concentration of power through the subversion of democratic
institutions.19 [Antidemocracy sus- tains hierarchical inequality by
suppressing the political and economic power of disfavored groups to
entrench the power of an oligarchic elite]{.underline}. Mass
incarceration presents considerable opportunities for antidemocratic
actors. First, [[incarcerated]{.mark} [people are]{.mark} typically
**[excluded]{.mark}** [from voting]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 [Prison [ger-
rymandering]{.mark} [uses]{.mark} these [disenfranchised]{.mark}
[people]{.mark} in redistricting [to bolster white]{.mark}, rural
[voting power at]{.mark} the expense of diverse cities]{.underline}.21
[Incarcerated people are sub- jected to]{.underline} the last legal
vestiges of **[[involuntary labor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, forced to work
for the insti- tutions that imprison them or even for for-profit
corporations at less than mini- mum wage.22 [Convictions]{.underline}
also [carry]{.underline} a wide range of [[collateral
consequences]{.mark} that **[rob]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[individuals
of]{.mark} essential **[dignity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [interests
[and]{.mark} cause **[linger]{.mark}ing [harm]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
their communities]{.underline}.23 [These]{.underline} [burdens fall
disproportionately on [marginalized commu-
nities]{.mark}]{.underline}.24 [[All]{.underline}]{.mark} of this serves
to [[reinforce]{.mark} America's most **fundamental** hierarchy:
[the]{.mark} **[racialized caste system]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that
persists as a lingering echo of slavery]{.underline}.25 [Political
elites]{.underline} [driving]{.underline} the march of
[antidemocracy]{.underline} today are largely [descended]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} their [predecessors who held other human beings in
**bondage**]{.underline}.26 It should come as little surprise that [the
political and economic [descendants of
slaveholders]{.mark}]{.underline}---and their ideological
allies---[would [support]{.mark} slavery and racial caste]{.underline}
in their modern trans- formations. Yet, [[prisons]{.underline}]{.mark}
hold another benefit for antidemocracy. They [offer a proving ground for
new antidemocratic policies]{.underline}. Where Justice Brandeis
famously hailed the ability of a state to act as a laboratory of
democracy,27 [[prisons]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, [have [become
the **laboratories**]{.mark} [**of**
**antidemocracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Antidemocratic [actors]{.mark}
can [exert]{.mark} all manner of **[abuses]{.mark}** on incarcerated
people, [far from the condemnation of courts and]{.mark} the [voting
public]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [[prisoners]{.underline}]{.mark}
challenge such policies in court, they of- ten [[face an unsympathetic
court and resource disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[leading to
**prece-**]{.mark} **[dents]{.mark}** favoring the prisons'
policies]{.underline}.28 Such decisions then stand as support and
justification for politicians interested in broader social control,
[[allowing the spread]{.mark} of antidemocratic policies to the
public]{.underline} at large.29 Even when politicians do not explicitly
cite to such cases, the cases have already served to demonstrate the
roadmap for defending such policies. While the well-documented harms of
our carceral state sit uncomfortably with our concept of democracy,
[prisons' roles in developing antidemocratic policies could represent an
even greater threat.]{.underline} This Book Review is the first piece of
scholarship to explore the connection be- tween antidemocratic policies
in prison and their subsequent counterparts among the free population.30
Black scholars and activists have long opposed prisons---especially in
their modern incarnation---as tools of an antidemocratic order. Prisons
by their very nature are an aberration within a democracy, but their
potential as laboratories of antidemocracy presents an even greater
threat. The lessons of the Attica up- rising resonate today, as prisons
still fail to provide adequate medical care, censor material on
ideological grounds, refuse to pay minimum wage, and incarcerate people
for decades at a time.31 While a surge of reform followed the uprising,
mass incarceration has exacerbated the problems, and meaningful changes
were fleeting. This Book Review proceeds in three parts. Part I reviews
Bellin's Mass Incar- ceration Nation, exploring the consequences of
Bellin's meticulously detailed re- search into the many causes of mass
incarceration. It also uses Bellin's book to probe the question his work
implies: Is mass incarceration compatible with de- mocracy? Part II then
discusses various antidemocratic policies in place in Amer- ican
prisons, including antilabor practices, censorship, restrictions on
bodily au- tonomy, and limits on legal recourse for official misconduct.
Part III discusses the analogs of these antidemocratic policies which
are developing in more gen- eral applications outside the prison walls.
It also addresses the difficulty of prov- ing a direct link between
antidemocratic practices and their antecedents in pris- ons. The final
section of Part III examines the necessity of radically reimagining our
criminal legal system to preempt these threats to democracy. Mere reform
may be sufficient to mitigate mass incarceration, but prison's
antidemocratic ef- fects cannot be resolved without abolitionist
interventions. i. the state of mass incarceration Free labor's the
cornerstone of U.S. economics. ---Killer Mike32 [The United States
incarcerates a higher percentage of its population than **any other**
**country** today]{.underline}.33 [This large percentage represents over
**two million** people at any given time.]{.underline}34 State and
federal prisons are ill-equipped to confine so many people.35 [The
burdens of our extreme reliance upon incarceration fall dispropor-
tionately on Black]{.underline} [people]{.underline}.36 Michelle
Alexander has documented the devastating impact of mass incarceration on
Black Americans: "[When the War on Drugs gained full steam in the
mid-1980s, prison admissions for African Americans **skyrocketed**,
nearly **quadrupling** in three years]{.underline}, and then
[increasing]{.underline} steadily [until it reached]{.underline} in 2000
[a level]{.underline} more than **[twenty-six times]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} [level in 1983]{.underline}."37 Collec- tively, all
the above trends are the phenomena that make up the core of mass
incarceration. Bellin's Mass Incarceration Nation provides an exhaustive
analysis of the state of mass incarceration in America and the policies
that brought us to this point. His thesis is that no single policy
created mass incarceration. Rather, a constel- lation of
policies---accelerated by the public's fear of crime and appetite for
pun- ishment---drove parallel processes that must be dismantled
individually if mass incarceration is to end. None of this is
particularly new information, though Bel- lin presents the material with
an uncommon thoroughness, demonstrating each policy choice's
contribution to the trend through a wealth of statistical evidence. The
conclusions that Bellin reaches are aimed at anyone who would seek to
end mass incarceration, whether reformist or abolitionist.38 Mass
incarceration can- not be undone with a single policy change, or even a
cluster of policy changes. Those policy changes must be implemented
together, along with serious efforts to reduce violence and shift
popular attitudes away from retribution.

The Economic Benefits of a Growing Inmate Population While understanding
the financial impact prison has on those incarcerated, it is equally
important, if we are to understand that there is no crisis in place for
"the system," to also understand the economic benefits in place creating
prisons. That is to say that while [the prison culture has negative
social and financial impacts on the individuals being "punished," it has
great rewards for those in the prison business]{.underline}. Engels
(1843), in his famous piece Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy,
asserted, "The struggle of capital against capital, of labour against
labour, of land against land, drives production to a feverpitch at which
production turns all natural and rational relations upsidedown" (p. 1).
While it appears unnatural and irrational to want [to]{.underline}
[incarcerate individuals, doing so in ways that disproportionately
impact populations considered by the dominant factions of society to be
without value **eliminates** that segment of the population from
accessing the wealth of the dominant group]{.underline}. Such [an
approach]{.underline} also [creates an industry (infrastructure,
employment, and market) in keeping those "**undesirables**" away from
wealth]{.underline} and access. In essence, those in
[prison]{.underline} do not simply help maintain the balance of wealth
and power, they actually [serve to create **larger differences** between
the "haves" and the "have nots]{.underline}." Not only do the imprisoned
remain poor, but [their families (as shown earlier) remain]{.underline}
[poor]{.underline}, helping those with power and privilege to gain more.
As Engels (1843) asserted, "with the fusion of the interests now opposed
to each other there disappears the contradiction between excess
population here and excess wealth there" (p. 5). Neutralizing and
[[**isolating** a]{.underline}]{.mark} segment of the [[population and
creating an industry whose]{.mark} **sole [purpose]{.mark}** [is
to]{.mark} neutralize and [isolate]{.mark} [works]{.mark} in tandem [to
**reproduce inequities**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [allow]{.mark} both
[wealth and poverty to grow]{.mark} in disproportion]{.underline}. Chang
and Thompkins (2002) asserted, "[[the dominant classes use
imprisonment]{.mark} as a means of]{.underline} political, economic, and
social [control]{.underline}" (p. 47). [One end of that social control
is seeking [to create economic market balance]{.mark}]{.underline}. That
is, [the state adjusts incarceration practices [to match]{.mark} the
economic equilibrium within the society]{.underline}. [In times of low
unemployment, less imprisonment occurs, but "when unemployment is high,
the state imprisons greater numbers to absorb [surplus labor]{.mark} and
suppress social unrest associated with economic
deprivation]{.underline}" (Chang & Thompkins, 2002). Chang and Thompkins
(2002) also suggested, "[increases in the unemployment rate, poverty,
income inequality, racial conflict, and political conservatism
contribute to an increase in the incarceration rate, [**independent** of
the crime rate]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. 47). A major shift in economic
trends of modern times traces back to the Reagan administration's
military-like assault on the economy in which the privileged became more
privileged and the masses were fed the lie that money would trickle down
as a result of protecting and privileging the wealthy---Reaganomics. The
early [1980s]{.underline} mark a decisive turn, which has only
accelerated as time passes, toward [leveraging crime, punishment, and
incarceration as a neauveaux industry]{.underline}---a mechanism [for
wealth to replicate and for those not deemed worthy to produce more than
they consume]{.underline}. [[Many benefit]{.mark} from our industrial
approach to incarceration, [including]{.mark} "[**construction**
companies, architects]{.mark}, and the suppliers of high-tech
[surveillance]{.mark} equipment and other materi- als \[who\] earn
profits when a new prison is built. . .\[creating\] the
[transformation]{.mark} [of **prisoners into
profits**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Sudbury, 2004, p. 12). As Samara (2000)
suggested, the 1980s and 1990s saw a widespread and swift expansion of
prison construction. [The 21st century has seen that expan- sion of
prisons notably shift toward privatization. [Private prisons]{.mark}
turn profit by lowering labor costs]{.underline}, which Chang and
Thompkins (2002) have noted are responsible for upwards of 60% of prison
budgets. Lowering labor costs [[means accessing a labor force]{.mark}
just slightly beyond those imprisoned, who are willing to work for low
wages, often [in rural communities]{.mark} [plagued by the elimination
of]{.mark} [manufacturing]{.mark} industries]{.underline} (Chang &
Thompkins, 2002; Hallett, 2002; Samara, 2000; Sudbury, 2004). Our
[[industrialized]{.underline}]{.mark} approach to
[[punishment]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[has become a]{.mark} key economic
[development strategy]{.mark} for rural towns devastated by the economic
restructuring brought about by globalization]{.underline}" (Sudbury,
2004, p. 13). Consequently, [rural communities]{.underline} in need of
economic stimulation are willing to [provide cheaper labor costs for
private prisons]{.underline}, expanding the profit margins for the
corporations that run these prisons. The landscape, then, is rural
[communities engaged in battles to make the **most attractive** offer
for private prisons to invest]{.underline}. According to Samara (2000),
"[much [like Third World nations]{.mark} [competing to attract foreign
investment]{.mark}, rural communities fighting each other for prisons
risk engaging in a race to the bottom and becoming dependent on their
community's new employer and the crime that supports it]{.underline}"
(p. 42). The busi- ness of prisons is big, and to put the picture into
better perspective, "[the United States spends more than \$**146
billion** dollars on the criminal justice system, including police, the
judiciary and court systems, and corrections. More than \$**50 billion**
of this is spent directly on corrections]{.underline}" (Brewer &
Heitzeg, 2008, p. 637). Put differently, if the judiciary, police, and
criminal justice system were a country, [it would be 57 out of 200 in
top GDP and would rank higher than the lowest 67 countries
combined]{.underline} (World Factbook, 2014). Once built, there is a
need to fill the private prisons with "residents" and ensure they are
there to stay for long periods of time and, hopefully, once let out,
recidivate. [[The goal]{.underline}]{.mark} in these prisons, according
to Samara (2000), [[is not rehabilitation]{.mark} or correction
[but]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, **[[failure]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
[[If the]{.mark} [prison]{.mark}-industrial complex [is
successful]{.mark}, [it will be the cause]{.mark} [of its own
demise]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If it fails]{.underline}. . .[this failure
will be used to expand the industry]{.underline}. From the point of view
of the prison business, then, failure is much more likely to lead to
success. (p. 43) Additionally, [the private prison
industry]{.underline}, according to Dolovich (2005), [exerts
considerable force, through lobbying, on legislators both for expansion
and in sentencing.]{.underline} According to Sarabi and Bender (2000),
through donations and hyper-lobbying think tanks, [legislation is
created that favors incarceration]{.underline}---the market has
significant influence on our approaches to punishment. According to
Sudbury (2004), [the sphere of influence extends to prison guard
[unions]{.mark}, [politicians, and the media]{.mark}, who [use]{.mark}
fear of crime and the [criminalization of minority peoples]{.mark} as
ways [to advocate]{.mark} their own [financial
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dolvich highlighted that "any time
criminal justice policy is influenced by parties hoping to further their
own financial interests through increased incarceration. . .is cause or
concern" (p. 533). To provide a clear and succinct analysis of what is
in place with respect to the prison-industrial complex, it is important
to understand that [This complex]{.underline} now [includes]{.underline}
more than **[3,300 jails]{.underline}**, more than **[1,500 state
prisons]{.underline}**, and **[100 federal]{.underline}**
**[prisons]{.underline}** in the United States. Nearly
**[300]{.underline}** of these are **[private prisons]{.underline}**.
More than **[30]{.underline}** of these institutions are
**[super-maximum facilities]{.underline}**, not including the
super-maximum units located in most other prisons. (Brewer & Heitzeg,
2008, p. 637) While the academic conversation has consistently called
the pipeline "school-to-prison," in- cluding the framing of this special
issue, the economic and market forces driving the prison- industrial
complex urge us, as the editors of this special issue, to consider and
reframe the pipeline as a "prison-to-school" pipeline. That is[, we do
not believe that incarceration occurs simply because crime is committed
or because of cracks in the schooling system. We believe that the impact
of prisons opens our vision to seeing that prisons demand a
clientele]{.underline}, particularly given the relative economic
instability over the last 35 years, save some time in the mid-1990s.
[[This]{.mark} economic [state requires prisons]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
previously mentioned, [to regulate unemployment and [to create]{.mark}
financial [separation between races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic
groups]{.mark}. Prisons, which are increasingly privatized, do not
simply meet society's demand for a space to execute pun- ishment; they,
in fact, create an entire enterprise and a well-lobbied one, whose base
function rallies around having a population to punish. [Without that

REALISM

### Contention 3: Advantage Counterplan

#### The United States criminal justice system ought to:

- Increase funding to pay for all additional actors to ensure a right to
  a speedy trial.

- Build new trial courtrooms.

- End pretrial detention, abolish cash bail, and encourage alternatives
  to imprisonment.

- End all overly punitive policies that allow prosecutorial overcharging
  to encourage plea bargaining.

- End court fees unable to be paid for by defendants

#### The counterplan is entirely for solving the aff -- our only offense is the "trials good" arguments on the other contentions.

#### Plea bargains are due to limited judicial resources -- increasing judicial capacity decreases plea bargain incentives and solves court clog

1\. Judicial Scarcity [One]{.underline} of the most critical [factors in
[plea pricing is]{.mark} [the]{.mark} extreme [**scar- city** of
judicial]{.mark} [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. 76
[Trials]{.underline}, in [particular, are a scarce commod-
ity.]{.underline} Indeed, [[the time and attention of]{.mark} all the
[actors]{.mark} in the criminal justice system---[prosecutors, police
detectives, defense attorneys, criminal investigators, judicial law
clerks, and judges]{.mark} most of all---[are fixed]{.mark} and subject
to the laws of scarcity,]{.underline} 77 [[as are]{.underline}]{.mark},
for that matter, [[courtroom availability]{.mark} for trying and
processing defendants]{.underline} 78 [[and jail beds]{.mark} for
housing them both before and after disposition of the
charges]{.underline}.79 Given the current size of the judicial
infrastructure, the number of trials that can be conducted in any given
year cannot ex- ceed some fixed ceiling. As Figure 1 illustrates,
[[there is a **strong cor- relation**]{.mark} [between judicial
caseloads and the guilty]{.mark} [plea rate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As
judicial caseloads increase, so too does the rate of guilty
pleas]{.underline}. 80 This relationship follows from the fact of
judicial scarcity. [If there are ten courtrooms in the county
courthouse, and each trial consumes on av- erage three days of court
time, and those courts are in session 200 days a year]{.underline},
simple arithmetic suggests that [no more than 666 trials could be
conducted per]{.underline} year. [Add in the amount of additional court
time consumed by pretrial hearings, arraignments, plea colloquies,
sentencing hearings, and the like, and that number will shrink even
further. If 600 defendants are charged each year in that district, then
the scarcity of courtrooms and judges will not matter much to the price
of a guilty plea]{.underline}. Indeed, [if adjudicative (and
prosecutorial) ca- pacity ever greatly exceeded the supply of
defendants, the price prose- cutors would be willing to pay for guilty
pleas might plummet or even disappear]{.underline}.[81 If 6000
defendants are prosecuted in the district each year, however, demand for
the scarce resource of court time will be quite intense. With 6000
defendants, it is quite clear that ninety per- cent or more of those
cases must be resolved without tria]{.underline}l. 82 All things being
equal, [prosecutorial demand for guilty pleas will sky- rocket, and
prices will rise, given the limited supply of court time for
trials]{.underline}.83 Figure 1 illustrates this correlation. In 1946,
the average federal judge carried 558 civil and criminal cases on his
docket. 84 That same year, 82.3% of all federal criminal convictions
were obtained through guilty pleas.85 After a brief uptick, federal
judicial caseloads steadily declined, reaching their nadir in 1968, when
they averaged 311.7 per judge. 86 After 1946, the guilty plea rate
continued to increase until 1951, five years after the peak in judicial
caseloads, after which it too fell into a decline, bottoming out in 1973
at 78.5%, again five years after the recent bottoming out of judicial
caseloads in 1968. 87 Mean- while, beginning in 1968, caseloads began to
rise. 88 The guilty plea rate remained relatively stable for five years
and then it too took an- other uptick in the early 1980s. 89 Since then,
caseloads and the guilty plea rate have both trended higher, with
caseloads spiking in 1985 (reaching an all-time high of 640 cases per
judge), while the guilty plea rate jumped to a then-new high in 1991 of
85.2%. 90 [The]{.underline} movement of the two [lines strongly suggests
that judicial caseloads are a leading indicator of the guilty plea
rate]{.underline}. 91 Intuitively, that conclusion makes sense. [Where
judges face high caseloads, they may well pressure pros- ecutors to
settle cases rather than try them; prosecutors may feel com- pelled to
resolve the case with a plea bargain]{.underline} rather than let it
linger, risking potential speedy trial problems, evidence deterioration,
and decreasing the deterrent sting of the sentence. Judges might also
in- crease trial penalties where they perceive a need to induce more
guilty pleas. 2. Value of Legal Entitlements

Model State Legislation," Brennan Center,

Introduction America's criminal justice system is in crisis. It is both
inequitable, placing a disproportionate burden on communities of color,
and extremely expensive, costing \$270 billion a year.1 What's more, our
current approach is not necessary to protect public safety. Research
conclusively shows that [high levels of imprisonment are simply not
necessary to protect communities]{.underline}. The Brennan Center has
found that around **[40 percent]{.underline}** [of America's prison
population is incarcerated with little public safety
justification]{.underline} --- in other words, [they are behind
bars]{.underline} **[unnecessarily]{.underline}**.2 Understandably,
voters across the political spectrum have lost faith in the fair
administration of justice, and the urgency of criminal justice reform
continues to be a rare point of bipartisan agreement. Despite this voter
consensus --- and with some notable exceptions --- policymakers
generally have been slow to respond. [This report offers state lawmakers
model legislation based on]{.underline} smart, bold policy [solutions
that would keep crime low while reducing mass
incarceration]{.underline}. These model bills are based on the policy
solutions put forth in our March 2018 publication Criminal Justice: An
Election Agenda for Candidates, Activists, and Legislators ("Criminal
Justice Agenda").3 More background on the impact and motivation for
these policies can be found in that report. This report provides the
blueprint to make those policy solutions achievable. In some cases, the
report spotlights robust and useful examples of state legislation
already introduced or in effect. In others, the Brennan Center created
original model legislation that can be easily adapted to the needs of
different jurisdictions. Notably, [[if every state]{.mark} [passed
the]{.mark} Alternative to Prison [Act]{.mark} and the Proportional
Sentencing Act, two new and original policy proposals, [the]{.mark}
national [prison population could]{.mark} safely [be reduced]{.mark} [by
nearly **40 percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 The report includes model
and example legislation to: • **[[Eliminate Imprisonment for]{.mark}
[Lower-Level Crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Incarceration is too often
the punishment of **first resort**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[I]{.mark}t
can be]{.underline} especially **[counterproductive]{.underline}** [for
people convicted of [low]{.mark}er-[level crimes]{.mark} who [could be
better sanctioned]{.mark} [by alternatives]{.mark} to incarceration,
[such as treatment, community service, or
probation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our model bill would eliminate
imprisonment for certain qualifying lower-level offenses and instead
require diversion into various alternatives to incarceration. • **[[Make
Sentences Proportional to Crimes]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [State [prison
sentences are **excessively**]{.mark} [long]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
growing body of research shows that [[there is]{.mark} little or [**no
relationship** between length of incarceration and recidivism]{.mark}.
[Our]{.mark} model [bill would reduce sentences by **25
percent**]{.mark} for those offenses that make up the largest share of
the prison population]{.underline}. • **[[Abolish Cash
Bail]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The decision of whether a defendant should
be [jail]{.mark}ed [while awaiting trial is]{.mark}]{.underline} often
[[based on]{.underline}]{.mark} a defendant's [[wealth and
not]{.underline}]{.mark} on public [[safety]{.underline}]{.mark}
considerations. This 2 report highlights a model bill developed by Civil
Rights Corps that would end the use of money bail. • Reform Prosecutor
Incentives. Our model bill incentivizes local prosecutors to change
their practices by providing bonus dollars to their offices if they
reduce incarceration while keeping recidivism rates low. • **[Reform
Marijuana Laws]{.underline}**. [Jail and prison spaces are
expensive]{.underline}, and [beds in these facilities should not be used
for people convicted of low-level marijuana offenses]{.underline}. This
report highlights a ballot initiative that legalized marijuana
possession in California and legislation that decriminalized marijuana
possession in Delaware, serving as useful models for lawmakers to enact
as legislation in other states. • **[Calibrate Fines to Defendants'
Ability to Pay and Eliminate Fees]{.underline}**. [[Courts]{.mark}
continue to [levy fees]{.mark} and fines [on defendants convicted of
crimes]{.mark} and civil violations [without considering]{.mark}
[whether they are financially able to pay them]{.mark}. [This leads
to]{.mark} [never-ending cycles of]{.mark} criminal [justice debt
and]{.mark} even modern-day [debtors' prisons]{.mark}. [Our
model]{.mark} bill [would calibrate criminal fines]{.mark} (monetary
sanctions prescribed by courts as punishment for committing a crime) [to
a defendant's ability to pay]{.mark} and eliminate the assessment of
court fees]{.underline} (flat fees intended to offset court costs) on
criminal defendants. It would mandate that fines are calculated with
reference to the number of days of income a person must forego to pay
them --- called "day fines." • Reduce Opioid Deaths. The
over-prescription of legal opioids, such as oxycodone and codeine,
contributes significantly to America's opioid crisis. This report
highlights legislation in New Jersey that limits when and how doctors
can prescribe opioids. It also highlights a Vermont bill that increases
access to drugs that can neutralize the effects of opioid overdoses. •
Curb the Number of Women Entering State Prisons. The best way to help
incarcerated women is to significantly reduce the female prison
population. Additionally, incarcerated women have unique needs, and
reforms aimed at conditions of confinement can help meet them. This
report provides summaries of legislation in New Jersey and Oklahoma that
encourage diversion and improve conditions of confinement and reentry
services for women and primary caretakers of children.

#### Banning peremptory challenges makes juries more diverse

2\. Peremptory Challenges The second type of challenge is the peremptory
challenge. All jurisdictions permit each attorney a specified number of
peremptory challenges.101 An attorney need not specify any reason to
invoke a peremptory challenge and have a juror removed.10 2 Peremptory
challenges permit attorneys to strike a juror if they believe, based on
a juror\'s answers to questions or the juror\'s demeanor, that the juror
is unlikely to keep an open mind about the client\'s claims or
defenses.1 03 In these cases, the attorney may not have enough
information to invoke a for-cause challenge. However, the attorney could
either have a strong feeling that the juror would not be impartial or
believe that the juror\'s worldview or other characteristics (e.g.,
political ideology) would cause the juror to heavily favor the opposing
side. In any event, a peremptory challenge would be appropriate.104
Peremptory challenges are intended to enhance the parties\' confidence
in the jury system.105 However, the legal literature has critically
examined peremptory challenges for decades, with many scholars noting
that attorneys have historically used and continue to use peremptory
challenges to cement racism in the jury selection process. 106 For
example, according to Deborah Zalesne and Kinney Zalesne, throughout the
twentieth century, peremptory challenges have mainly served to
\"manifest racial discrimination and irrational prejudice rather than to
balance the scales between the state and the accused.\" 107 Danielle
Ward Mason further explains that in prosecutorial use of peremptory
challenges, \"\[r\]acial discrimination occurred when a prosecutor would
strike all eligible black jurors from service, especially when the
defendant was black. Since the number of blacks on the venire was
usually very small, the prosecutor had enough peremptory challenges at
his disposal to remove all of them.\"\' 08 Although Batson v. Kentucky
attempted to provide a safeguard against racial discrimination in
peremptory challenges, unfortunately, it has proven largely
ineffective.1 09 Attorneys must simply provide \"race-neutral\" reasons
for striking potential jurors, and the burden then shifts to the
opposing side to prove racist intentions. 110 Many scholars have also
acknowledged that the process to ensure attorneys do not use peremptory
challenges to systematically eliminate jurors of a certain race is
inadequate.1\"\' Some have proposed the use of questionnaires rather
than relying solely on voir dire. 1\' 2 Importantly, [[peremptory
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} originated in the English common law
system and [[were]{.mark} **entirely [abolished]{.mark}** [in
England]{.mark} in 1989 [as well as]{.mark} in [Canada]{.mark} in
2019]{.underline}.113 Our belief is that [[peremptory challenges do more
harm than good and **cannot be reformed**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As such,
[[peremptory challenges should be **abolished**]{.mark} and replaced
with measures aimed at eliminating racist potential jurors with
for-cause challenges]{.underline}, such as those described herein.
However, because this may not happen in the foreseeable future, we
suggest ways that attorneys can use peremptory challenges to root out
racism in the jury selection process. While, as discussed above, the
peremptory challenge may often be used in a way that promotes racial
bias in jury selection,114 attorneys can also use the challenge to
eliminate jurors who exhibit racism of any type.\"1 5 Thus, the research
shared in this Article can enable the effective use of peremptory
challenges to combat the influence of racism on juries and their
deliberations. 1 6 Having a few more attorneys equipped with tools to
identify bias in the jury pool admittedly cannot solve the large problem
of structural racism in the American legal system; however, given that
intractable structural problems are difficult to remedy and require
multiple initiatives at different points of contact within the system,
increasing the number of attorneys trained in identifying and
challenging a racist juror can offer a concrete, short-term option to
aid in the selection of a bias-free jury. We recognize that some
attorneys may apply our research and use peremptory challenges to
eliminate individuals who are bias-free and select jurors who exhibit
racial bias because such bias will benefit their client\'s claim or
defense. Given that peremptory challenges already appear to be used in
this way,\" 7 our hope is that the benefits of informing attorneys about
the types of racism and how to better identify it will be used to remove
racism at jury selection rather than further implant it. C. Current Ways
of Addressing Racism in Juries

#### Justice comes before money

**Lynch 11** \[Tim Lynch, adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and
former director of Cato's Project on Criminal Justice with a BS and a JD
from Marquette University, 6-24-2011, \"The Devil\'s Bargain: How Plea
Agreements, Never Contemplated by the Framers, Undermine Justice\", Cato
Institute,
https://www.cato.org/commentary/devils-bargain-how-plea-agreements-never-contemplated-framers-undermine-justice#\]/Kankee

Most Americans are under the mistaken impression that when the
government accuses someone of a crime, the case typically proceeds to
trial, where a jury of laypeople hears arguments from the prosecution
and the defense, then deliberates over the evidence before deciding on
the defendant's guilt or innocence. This image of American justice is
wildly off the mark. Criminal cases rarely go to trial, because about 95
percent are resolved by plea bargains. In a plea bargain, the prosecutor
usually offers a reduced prison sentence if the defendant agrees to
waive his right to a jury trial and admit guilt in a summary proceeding
before a judge. This standard operating procedure was not contemplated
by the Framers. The inability to enter into plea arrangements was not
among the grievances set forth in the Declaration of Independence. Plea
bargaining was not discussed at the Constitutional Convention or during
ratification debates. In fact, the Constitution says "the Trial of all
Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment; shall be by Jury." It is evident
that jury trials were supposed to play a central role in the
administration of American criminal justice. But as the Yale law
professor John Langbein noted in a 1992 Harvard Journal of Law and
Public Policy article, "There is an astonishing discrepancy between what
the constitutional texts promise and what the criminal justice system
delivers." No one ever proposed a radical restructuring of the criminal
justice system, one that would replace jury trials with a supposedly
superior system of charge-and-sentence bargaining. Like the growth of
government in general, plea bargaining slowly crept into and eventually
grew to dominate the system. From the government's perspective, plea
bargaining has two advantages. First, it's less expensive and
time-consuming than jury trials, which means prosecutors can haul more
people into court and legislators can add more offenses to the criminal
code. Second, by cutting the jury out of the picture, prosecutors and
judges acquire more influence over case outcomes. From a defendant's
perspective, plea bargaining extorts guilty pleas. People who have never
been prosecuted may think there is no way they would plead guilty to a
crime they did not commit. But when the government has a "witness" who
is willing to lie, and your own attorney urges you to accept one year in
prison rather than risk a ten-year sentence, the decision becomes
harder. As William Young, then chief judge of the U.S. District Court in
Massachusetts, observed in an unusually blunt 2004 opinion, "The focus
of our entire criminal justice system has shifted away from trials and
juries and adjudication to a massive system of sentence bargaining that
is heavily rigged against the accused." One point often stressed by
progressives is that trials bring scrutiny to police conduct. But when
deals are struck in courthouse hallways, judges never hear about illegal
searches or detentions. This only encourages further misconduct.
Conservatives, meanwhile, are right to wonder whether overburdened
prosecutors give the guilty too many lenient deals. Why should an armed
robber get to plead guilty to a lesser crime such as petty theft? It is
remarkable how few people will openly defend the primary method by which
our courts handle criminal cases. [[The most common **apologia**]{.mark}
for plea bargaining [is]{.mark} a [pragmatic]{.mark} argument:
Courthouses are so busy that they would grind to a halt if every case,
or even a substantial share of them, went to trial]{.underline}. But
[[there is **nothing inevitable** about]{.mark} those crushing
[caseloads]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Politicians]{.mark} [chose to expand
the list of crimes]{.mark}, eventually turning **millions** of Americans
into criminals]{.underline}. [Ending]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
disastrous [war on drugs would unclog our courts in short
order.]{.underline} In any case, [[trials are]{.mark} [one]{.mark} of
the few [things the government **indisputably**]{.mark} [should be
spending money]{.mark}]{.underline} on. [If additional funds are needed,
free them up by stopping the nation-building exercises abroad and the
corporate welfare here at home]{.underline}. [[The administration of
justice ought to be a **top priority** of
government]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### Contention 4: Racism (Stock)

#### Court clog is good -- crashing the system causes a crisis resulting in mass civil rights protests and jury nullification that ends racialized mass incarceration

**Heiner 15** \[Brady Heiner, Affiliated Faculty of African American
Studies at CSU Fullerton, 2015, "The procedural entrapment of mass
incarceration: Prosecution, race, and the unfinished project of American
abolition," Philosophy and Social Criticism,

Conclusion: '[Go To Trial: **Crash the Justice System**]{.underline}
\[[L\]aw]{.underline} and order [exist for the purpose of establishing
justice, \[but\] when they fail to do this they become the
**dangerously** structured dams that **block the flow** of social
progress]{.underline}. (Martin Luther King, Jr, 'Letter From a
Birmingham Jail' (1963), p. 10) Functionally analogous and
genealogically linked to the unimpeachable immunity and irresponsible
power enjoyed by Frederick Douglass' overseer, the actions of contempo-
rary American prosecutors, who operate inside the black box of
prosecutorial discretion, are not subject to judicial review. And the
subjects of color who have recently sought (and might presently seek) to
raise claims of racially discriminatory prosecution are barred from
legal standing by judicially (though not judiciously) imposed
evidentiary standards that are virtually impossible to meet in the
absence of active cooperation from prosecutors in their own prosecution.
The functional discretionary space carved out for American
[prosecutors]{.underline} [constitutes an **irresponsible**
power]{.underline} -- a space of power in which [conscious and
unconscious biases are allowed to flourish]{.underline}, [at the direct
expense of]{.underline} the flourishing of [struggling
communities]{.underline} [of color]{.underline} across the country.120
But like the past regimes of racial democracy to which it is
genealogically linked, the contemporary sys- tem of [mass incarceration
is disrupted]{.underline} and resisted [by agents of
abolition]{.underline} whose power and ingenuity are akin to those of
Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. One such abolitionist is Susan
Burton,121 whose insightful conversation with civil rights lawyer and
author of The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander, inspired this article in
the first place.122 Burton knows a lot about being processed through the
criminal justice sys- tem. She began a downward spiral when a Los
Angeles police cruiser tragically ran over and killed her 5-year-old
son. Consumed with grief, without receiving as much as an apology from
law enforcement, and without access to the therapy or anti-depressant
medications to which someone with greater medical resources might turn
for support, Bur- ton sought comfort through illicit drugs and became
addicted to crack cocaine. Living in an impoverished Black community
under siege in the 'war on drugs', she was arrested and offered the
first of many plea deals that put her behind bars for a series of
non-violent, drug-related offenses. Every time she was released, she
found herself trapped in an under-caste, subject to legal discrimination
in employment and housing. After 15 years of revolving in and out of
prison, Burton was finally admitted to a pri- vate drug treatment
facility and secured a job. When she got sober, she dedicated her life
to making sure no other woman would suffer what she had been through.
Burton now runs 5 safe homes for formerly incarcerated women in Los
Angeles. Her organization, A New Way of Life Re-entry Project,123
supplies a lifeline for women released from prison. It is also building
a movement with groups like All of Us or None, organizing formerly
incarcerated people and encouraging them to demand restoration of their
basic civil and human rights. Burton explicitly links her organization's
efforts to abolitionist struggles akin to those of Harriet Tubman,
referring to A New Way of Life as 'an under- ground railroad \[that\]
starts at the prison gates and arches over all barriers to freedom'.124
Burton is painfully aware that [the norm of pleading guilty enhances
prosecutors' capacity to process an ever-increasing number of cases,
widening the net of mass incar- ceration]{.underline}. She also knows
that the system of [mass incarceration relies upon the wide- spread
'forfeiture' of rights that the plea bargain regime
manufactures]{.underline}. With this in mind, Burton posed the following
question to Alexander: '[What would happen if we organized]{.underline}
[thousands]{.underline}, even hundreds of thousands, [of people charged
with crimes to **refuse to play the game**, to refuse to plea
out]{.underline}? [What if they all insisted on their Sixth Amendment
right to trial? Couldn't we bring the whole system to a
**halt**]{.underline} [just like that]{.underline}?' Initially stunned,
Alexander 'launched, predictably, into a lecture about what prose-
cutors would do to people if they actually tried to stand up for their
rights', reminding Burton of the risks involved in facing down the
arsenal of excessive and overlapping sen- tencing schemes that
prosecutors were equipped with. She may also have reminded Bur- ton of
the severity of the so-called 'trial penalty' that, according to recent
data analysis, makes the sentence following a jury trial conviction on
average 3.5 years more severe than the sentence imposed after a guilty
plea.125 Painfully and personally aware of such risks, Burton replied,
'Believe me, I know. I'm asking what we can do. [[Can we crash the
system]{.underline}]{.mark} just [[by exercising our
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}?' To which Alexander responded: The answer
is **[[yes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The system of [[mass incarceration
depends]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**entirely** [on]{.mark} the [coop-
eration]{.mark} of those it seeks to control]{.underline}. [If everyone
charged with crimes suddenly exercised \[their\] constitutional rights,
[there would not be enough judges, lawyers or prison cells]{.mark} to
deal with the ensuing **tsunami** of litigation.]{.underline} Not
everyone would have to join for the revolt to have an impact; as the
legal scholar Angela J. Davis noted, '[if the number of peo- ple
exercising their trial rights]{.underline} [suddenly]{.underline}
doubled or [tripled]{.underline} in some jurisdictions, [it would create
[chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}.' Such chaos would force mass incarceration
to the top of the agenda for politicians and policy makers, [[leaving
them]{.underline}]{.mark} only two viable
[[options]{.underline}]{.mark}: [sharply **[scale back]{.mark}** the
number of criminal [cases filed]{.mark} (for drug
possession]{.underline}, for example) or amend the Constitution (or
eviscerate it by judicial 'emergency' fiat). [Either action would create
a crisis and the sys- tem would crash -- it could no longer function as
it had before]{.underline}. [Mass protest would force a public
conversation that]{.underline}, to date, [we have been
content]{.underline} [to avoid]{.underline}. Burton, who shares
Alexander's assessment of the risk and potentiality of mass plea
refusal, claimed: I'm not saying we should do it. I'm saying we ought to
know that it's an option. People should understand that simply
[exercising their rights would shake the foundations of our justice
system which works only so long as we accept its terms]{.underline}. As
you know, [another brutal system of racial and social control once
prevailed in this country, and it never would have ended if some people
weren't willing to risk their lives]{.underline}. It would be nice if
reasoned argu- ment would do, but as we've seen that's just not the
case. So maybe, just maybe, if we truly want to end this system, some of
us will have to risk our lives. [[It would be difficult to **overstate**
the]{.mark} strategic [advantages]{.mark} and potentially transformative
political repercussions of the mass conscientious [plea
refusal]{.mark}]{.underline} that Burton incisively pro- poses. [In the
tradition of the civil rights movement]{.underline} practice of
non-violent direct action -- which, in [**M**artin **L**uther
**K**ing]{.underline}, Jr,'s famous formulation, [sought to '**[create a
crisis']{.mark}**]{.underline} in [the racist structures of society [by
establishing]{.mark} a 'creative, **[constructive tension']{.mark}**
that forces society to confront and correct racial injustices that it
has constantly refused to address]{.underline} -- [the mass [assertion
of]{.mark} constitutional due process [rights]{.mark}
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} rapidly and efficiently [overwhelm the
prosecutorial regime, [throw]{.mark} the system of [mass incarceration
into **crisis**]{.mark}, [and force]{.mark} the government to take
[immediate]{.mark}]{.underline} and substantive
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark} to remedy its racial injustice.126 In the
short term, state and federal prosecutors could use their discretion to
desist from prosecuting the hundreds of thousands of rights-demanding
people who are annually charged with the multitude of economic, drug,
immigration and other non-violent offenses currently criminalized in
existing penal codes. To give a sense of the number of defendants in
question, the federal system convicted 90,000 people in 2010, nearly 97
per cent of which cases were the product of plea bargains.127 Fewer than
6,000 (6%) of these convictions were for violent and sex crimes; 54,000
(60%) involved immi- gration or drug offenses as the most serious
conviction offense.128 State courts made 1.1 million felony convictions
in 2006, 94 per cent of which were the product of plea bar- gains. Only
205,000 (18%) of these convictions were for violent and sex crimes. Of
those remaining, 320,000 (30%) were for property crimes and 375,000
(34%) involved a drug offense as the most serious conviction offense.129
Taking these two annual snapshots as relatively representative, it is
reasonable to claim that across state and federal jurisdic- tions some
750,000 people -- 60 per cent of all those convicted -- plead guilty or
no con- test each year to non-violent offenses related to immigration,
drugs and property. That is equivalent in size to the entire population
of Birmingham, Alabama. However, even if prosecutors were willing en
masse to shoulder the responsibility themselves of declining to litigate
some significant portion of these cases, it is doubt- ful that the
political system would allow this decidedly de-carceral deployment of
pro- secutorial discretion to remain in the black box (i.e. free from
governmental and public scrutiny) that the widespread carceral use of
discretion currently enjoys. A more likely scenario of systemic
prosecutorial desistence in the face of the mass asser- tion of
constitutional due process rights would involve prosecutors turning
higher up the executive chain of command to pressure the state and US
Attorneys General and Departments of Justice, and then state Governors
and the US President to sanction a generalized plan for desistence.
However, since [the prosecutorial function is]{.underline} only a valve
([albeit the main valve]{.underline}) [in the pipeline of the prison
industrial complex]{.underline}, even a generalized and federally
sanctioned policy of prosecutorial desistence would not quell the
tsunami of litigation produced by a systematically organized mass
movement of conscientious plea refusal unless the influx of criminal
cases were also curtailed at the source -- that is, unless prosecutorial
desistence were combined with a parallel desis- tence throughout law
enforcement, which would necessitate seismic shifts and reductions in
policing priorities, practices, expenditures and departmental
organizations. Executive desistence in the face of the systemic crisis
generated by the mass asser- tion of due process rights would likely
prove unsustainable, however, as it would pre- sumably raise widespread
doubts about the rationality, legitimacy and procedural justice of
maintaining an arsenal of criminal statutes that routinely go
unenforced. Selective enforcement is, of course, the stock-in-trade of
the prosecutorial and policing professions, which, while financially
flush in the era of mass incarceration, are execu- tors of a distended
body of criminal law that, as Harvard Law Professor William Stuntz
claims, 'covers far more conduct than any jurisdiction could possibly
punish'.130 How- ever, programmatic desistence of the magnitude that
would be required to restrict crim- inal justice processing to the
levels that could be maintained while still accommodating the
constitutional trial rights demanded by a mass movement of conscientious
plea objectors would arguably erode the perceived legitimacy of the
criminal law (at least with respect to the lower-spectrum of the penal
code). Such [potentialities]{.underline} [would]{.underline} likely
**[force]{.underline}** [the question of state and federal legislative
reform in the direction of de- criminalization, or even
legalization]{.underline} (e.g. in the case of certain classes [of
drugs]{.underline}).131 Recent state direct-democracy initiatives
suggest that there may be fairly substantive popular support for
attenuating criminal codes through selective statutory mitigation,
decriminalization and legalization. For example, Colorado (2012),
Washington State (2012), Oregon (2014), Alaska (2014) and Washington, DC
(2014) have all passed measures to legalize, regulate and tax the
production and sale of marijuana for rec- reational use. Californians
also overwhelmingly passed the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012
(Proposition 36), which shortens sentences of those subjected to life
prison terms for 'non-serious', 'non-violent' offenses, and Proposition
47 (2014), which de- felonizes all drug use, downgrades a multiplicity
of non-violent economic and drug offenses from felonies to misdemeanors,
and reinvests the estimated \$150 million in annual state savings toward
school truancy and drop-out prevention, victim services, mental health
and drug abuse treatment, and other programs designed to expand alter-
natives to incarceration. Such measures demonstrate popular support for
advancing a public safety strategy beyond incarceration to include
treatment and prevention. [Mass plea refusal could intensify such
efforts by striking a **major blow** to [the prison industrial
complex]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, as Angela Y. Davis
points out, '**[[devours]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [social wealth
needed to]{.mark} [address]{.mark} the very problems \[related to
[employment, education, housing, addiction, mental disorder]{.mark},
etc.\] that have led to **spiraling** numbers of
prisoners]{.underline}'.132 Not even accounting for the multibillion
dollar corporate industry that weaves in and out of the public and
private prison systems,133 [US criminal justice expenditures grew by
over 600 per cent between 1980 and 2006, from \$35 billion to \$215
billion. Criminal justice system employment (including police, and
corrections, judicial and legal, at federal, state and local levels)
doubled during that same period, rising from 1.2 million to 2.5 million
people]{.underline}.134 Widespread sentencing mitigation at all or most
levels of existing criminal codes and de-criminalization in the
lower-spectrum of existing penal codes would disemploy and disencumber a
significant portion of these people and resources for more socially
generative employment and investment. As an exercise in imaginative
possibility, consider the following scenario. [If we cut public
financing of mass incarceration]{.underline} by, for example, returning
criminal justice spending to the inflation-adjusted levels spent in 1980
-- prior to the escalations of the wars on drugs and illegal
immigration, which have since fueled the 500 per cent increase in the
incarcerated population -- over \$[**[125 billion]{.underline}** [of
public wealth would be freed]{.underline}]{.mark} [[up]{.mark} each year
for]{.underline} investment in socially reparative and generative
enterprises like [education, childcare, mental and physical health care
and drug treatment, public housing, job training, food assistance, parks
and recreation]{.underline}, etc. Such enterprises could easily absorb
and constructively employ the millions of people that America's carceral
system currently employs and confines. As Davis maintains, 'The creation
of new institutions that lay claim to the space now occupied by the
prison \[industrial complex\] can eventually start to crowd out the
prison so that it would inhabit increasingly smaller areas of our social
and psychic landscape'.135 Of course, rather than a complex of executive
desistence, legislative mitigation and de-criminalization, and public
reinvestment that tilts toward a less carceral and puni- tive society,
it is also possible that government could respond to the crisis
generated by mass conscientious plea refusal by pursuing a still more
punitive agenda to enlarge and shore up the procedural pipelines of mass
incarceration. State legislatures could pro- cure emergency funding to
expand the procedural capacity of their respective criminal justice
systems. Federal legislators could seek to bolster such expansion
efforts by enacting an emergency financial bail-out of the criminal
justice system akin to the 2008 bail-out of the US financial system,
ramping up national criminal justice spend- ing exponentially over and
above the already historically unprecedented heights. However, this
course of action seems politically unlikely. State and municipal bud-
gets have not only been shrinking due to regressive tax reforms and the
economic crises produced by American finance capitalism and corporate
outsourcing, the portions of those budgets devoted to corrections and
law enforcement have already exponentially swelled, due largely to
current (and in some cases unconstitutional) overcrowding in many state
prison systems. [[The electorate's appetite]{.mark} for bankrolling the
prison industrial complex [is **waning**]{.mark} amid **steeply**
declining and non-existent state financing of other social priorities
like education, childcare, recreation and infrastructure. Criminal
[proce- dural expansion would]{.mark} also [be]{.mark} [logistically
**fraught**]{.mark}, [**straining** political support]{.mark}, as [it
would entail]{.mark} appointing [an **army** of judges]{.mark}, many of
whom are elected, which would in turn require **[special]{.mark}**
**[elections]{.mark}**, etc., as well as enlisting a [multitude]{.mark}
of eligible citizens [for jury duty]{.mark} service, and hiring the
necessary personnel to coordinate them]{.underline}. [In
effect]{.underline}, on the side of utility, [increasing [swaths]{.mark}
of the populace have begun to [iden- tify]{.mark} that public investment
in [mass incarceration is]{.mark} **[depleting]{.mark}** valuable
[social resources]{.mark} while producing disproportionately little
social benefit]{.underline} in the short term [and]{.underline} over the
long term [exacerbating]{.underline} the very [social
problems]{.underline} related to intergenerational poverty (e.g.
unemployment, substance addiction, educational disparity and mental
disorder) [that lead to increased incarceration]{.underline}. On the
side of justice, increasing numbers of [people]{.underline} are
beginning to [recognize that the US carceral state is falling short
of]{.underline} the threshold of [social justice]{.underline} requisite
to render state punishment morally legitimate.136 'If a society is to
have the moral right to punish, its laws must be just', writes Igor
Primoratz in his book Justifying Legal Punishment. But that is not all;
society must be doing something \[constructive\] about those social con-
ditions that breed crime . . . If it does little or nothing about those
social problems that generate law-breaking, and then goes on to punish
the law-breakers, it will be rightly seen as both callous and
hypocritical, and thus as lacking the moral standing requisite for
punishing offenders in good faith.137 In addition to (and in virtue of)
producing a structural crisis in the procedural system of state
punishment, the widespread assertion of constitutional due process
rights among those protesting procedural entrapment would openly expose
the moral illegitimacy of the institutional agencies of mass
incarceration, which require the compelled forfeiture of constitutional
rights of nearly all their targets in order for the system to function.
In elaborating the critical and transformative moral, political and
socio-economic work that the strategy of mass plea refusal would and
could do, one must also squarely confront its acute risks and
disadvantages. By calling upon masses of individual defen- dants, as
Susan Burton put it, 'to refuse to play the game, to refuse to plea
out', such a movement against mass incarceration would effectively be
asking those individuals to risk the severe existential burdens meted
out by the unconscionably exorbitant 'trial pen- alty' that has been
fashioned by the system's deliberately disproportional sentencing
schemes. It would, as an anonymous reviewer of this article noted,
'dilute the existential situatedness of many criminal defendants who may
have good reasons for pleading guilty'. In real human terms, a mass
assertion of constitutional due process rights would call upon
conscientious objectors to potentially spend years, even lifetimes, in
cages cut off from their communities, for the cause of social and racial
justice. Michelle Alexander gave voice to the very legitimate reluctance
such severe existen- tial risks would prompt among even those, such as
herself, most committed to ending mass incarceration: As a mother
myself, I don't think there's anything I wouldn't plead guilty to if a
prosecutor told me that accepting a plea was the only way to get home to
my children . . . I truly can't imagine risking life imprisonment, so
how can I urge others to take that risk -- even if it would send shock
waves through a fundamentally immoral and unjust system?138 As a parent
myself, I strongly identify with Alexander's hesitancy, which reflects
the significant human risks and costs of this grassroots strategy of
challenging mass incarceration and its system of procedural entrapment.
Nevertheless, when we read (and likely identify with) her words -- 'I
don't think there's anything I wouldn't plead guilty to if a prosecutor
told me that accepting a plea was the only way to get home to my chil-
dren' -- I think we also ought to hear the echoes of the words spoken a
century ago by [the]{.underline} anonymous [African American laborer
from postbellum Georgia mentioned]{.underline} earlier. [When faced with
the plea bargain of his day]{.underline}, he claimed, '[We would have
signed anything]{.underline}, just [to get away]{.underline}.' We should
also recall the consequence of the coerced consent that he and his
contemporaries gave to that executive order of the postbellum racial
contract: 'Really [we had made ourselves lifetime slaves]{.underline},
or peons, as the laws called us.' [By continuing to indi- vidually
consent]{.underline} (on, however, an instrumentally rational basis) [to
the coercive contract of the plea bargain regime, by continuing to
collectively consent to the procedural entrapment of the system of mass
incarceration, we are greasing the wheels of the carceral machine that
labels those whom it targets as **lifetime felons** and imposes upon
them permanent status-based forms of **civil death** and disability
comparable with those experienced by antebellum **slaves** and
postbellum debt **peons** and leased **convict**
**laborers**]{.underline}.139 Inspired by Susan Burton, this article
conceptualizes procedural entrapment as a con- temporary mechanism of
racial domination, begins to think through organized mass plea refusal
as a viable strategy of resistance, and articulates the connections
between these forms of domination and resistance and those of the
antebellum and postbellum periods. In tracing these connections, I, like
Burton, seek to foster a historical and imaginative way of thinking
about contemporary anti-racist struggle against mass incarceration that
enables us to see ourselves as acting in concert with the legacy of
struggle left to us by Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells
and Martin Luther King, Jr. They, along with a multitude of other
abolitionists and civil rights activists of the past, also faced
inestimable odds, severe existential risks and the inevitability of
racialized legal violence, and yet they persevered in fashioning
radically reconstructive collective proj- ects of racial and social
justice. Galvanized by our connection to this legacy, we ought to allow
ourselves to be embol- dened by Burton's incisive observation that, by
simply demanding and exercising their constitutional rights to due
process, those who are systematically targeted by our carceral state can
swiftly throw it into crisis through organized, concerted action. Such
action on the part of the procedurally entrapped, who shoulder the most
existential risk, would in turn have to be sustained by solidarity
efforts outside of prison walls and court halls, by an abolitionist
movement that collectively struggled and sacrificed to counterbalance
the social, economic and existential costs incurred by those refusing to
forfeit their consti- tutional rights, especially those punitively
sentenced on account of their refusal.140 [Creatively
reinventing]{.underline} the organized efforts of [the civil rights
movement to support political prisoners and civil disobedients who acted
heroically and at great sacrifice to themselves to advance the cause of
racial justice, the movement to abolish the prison industrial complex
would]{.underline} have to [extend]{.underline} [the]{.underline} arc of
Burton's **[underground]{.underline}** **[railroad]{.underline}** from
prison gates [to courthouses]{.underline} and police precincts. The
movement would have to commit to pool and develop resources and raise
funds to support the legal defense of those engaged in conscientious
plea refusal. It would have to help defendants overcome the
unconscionable information deficits they face by supplying them with
resources to assist them in understanding the collateral consequences of
criminal conviction where the courts fail to do this.141 It would have
to commit to materially and socially support the families of those
protesting entrapment, and create childcare collectives to refuse to
allow protesters' children to be claimed by the injurious arms of the
foster care system.142 Those eligible would have to up-end trends of
diminished adherence to the civic duty of jury service and revive the
19th-century abolitionist understanding of the jury as 'the People's
last check against oppressive government and arbitrary official
power'.143 Like abolitionists of the 19th century who used the jury box
to resist and nullify immoral and unjust fugitive slave laws,
contemporary abolitionists should seriously consider the proposal of
Paul Butler, critical race legal scholar and former Washington, DC,
federal prosecutor, who argues that [[jurors should]{.mark}
[resist]{.mark} the systematic racial injustice of mass incarceration
and 'dismantle the master's house with the master's tools' [by]{.mark}
exercising their power of **[jury]{.mark} [nullification]{.mark}** in
the trials of oppressed people]{.underline} charged with non-egregious
offenses.144 People would have to protest in the streets, jails and
prisons and coordinate multifar- ious media and petition campaigns to
publicize and publicly support the actions of those engaged in
conscientious plea refusal (e.g. by informing citizens of their right to
jury nul- lification), to articulate the political analysis that
animates the movement and the goals toward which it strives. Mass
political pressure would have to be applied to the legisla- tive and
executive branches of government to address the crisis through law
enforcement desistence and de-carceral reforms rather than further
carceral fortification. The move- ment could support, pressure and
embolden public defenders (e.g., through the American Bar Association's
Standing Committees on Ethics and Professional Responsibility and on
Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants) to refuse cases, and demand that the
American Bar Association's Standards of Public Defense Related to
Excessive Workloads be upheld to materially enable public defenders to
furnish the competent and diligent coun- sel that the rules of ethical
professional conduct require.145 To diminish the risks of con-
scientious plea refusal, the mass assertion of constitutional due
process rights could also be specifically taken up and organized in a
targeted manner among those facing charges in the lower-spectrum of the
criminal code and who thus face less severe risks of pena- lization for
exercising their constitutional right to trial.146 This is only a
sampling of the ways that [the movement to abolish the prison industrial
complex might coordinate the strategy of conscientious plea
refusal]{.underline} with other solidarity efforts and modes of
resistance to counterbalance, if not completely offset, the asymme-
trical existential risks that would be shouldered by those directly
resisting procedural entrapment through the assertion of their
constitutional rights. Such reflections make clear the extensive and
profound genealogical linkages and functional parallels between American
slavery and contemporary mass incarceration. They also make clear
Burton's claim that while it would be nice if reasoned argument would
suffice to overturn mass incarceration's brutal system of racial and
social control, we have seen that that is just not the case. As Martin
Luther King, Jr, argued from a jail cell in 1963, 'We know through
painful experience that [freedom is **never** voluntarily given by the
oppressor; it **must be demanded** by the oppressed]{.underline}.'147 If
the epistemic resistance displayed by the highest courts of the land in
the face of reasoned arguments in favor of responsibly restricting
present-day prosecutorial powers and their racially unjust outcomes is
any indication, Burton is right that civil rights litigation is
insufficient to end the procedural entrapment of mass incarceration. As
was the case with abolitionist struggles of prior eras, larger risks
will have to be taken. Like Burton in 2012 and Martin Luther King, Jr,
in 1963, Frederick Douglass famously argued in 1857 that: The whole
history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet
made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle . . . Those
who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men \[sic\]
who want crops without plowing up the ground . . . This struggle may be
a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and
physical, but it must be a struggle. [Power concedes nothing without a
demand. It never did and it never will]{.underline}.148 Those who are
currently the targets of mass incarceration and its system of procedural
entrapment should not wage this struggle and shoulder these risks alone.

II\. PLEA BARGAINING RACE AS P RACTICED YIELDS RACIALLY DISPARATE
OUTCOMES In this section, I explain how the [plea
bargaining]{.underline} process, as traditionally practiced by the
stereotypical public defender and prosecutor, is likely to [yield
racially disparate justice outcomes]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
**[[speed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the process]{.underline}, 52 [the
[unfettered discretion]{.mark} of the prosecutor]{.underline},53
[[and]{.mark} the [retributive focus]{.mark}]{.underline} 54 [coalesce
to [create]{.mark} a justice [negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline} that is
[**[compromised]{.underline}** [by racial
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Furthermore, the positional
posture of plea negotiations in which public defenders and prosecutors
maintain a narrow focus on retributive justice precludes any meaningful
discussion about what would be an appropriate and responsive justice
outcome for that defendant.55 A. Traditional Plea Bargaining Practice56
A common plea bargaining scene: A public defender and a prosecutor, both
assigned to the same case, meet by happenstance in a busy courthouse
corridor.57 Even though [[neither prosecutor or public defender has
spent much]{.mark} [time]{.mark}]{.underline} preparing for this
negotiation, they still decide to seize the moment, check one more item
off their "to do" list and plea bargain the case. 58 Together they seek
refuge in a corner of the corridor and throw out possible pleas and
prison sentences, framed within the contours of what the prosecutor is
willing to consider a just resolution.59 This negotiation may take place
in under five minutes. B. Cognitive Behavior Psychologists: The [Plea
Bargaining]{.underline} Structure [Is Conducive to]{.underline} Allowing
Prosecutors' and Public Defenders' [Implicit Racial Biases]{.underline}
to Emerge Cognitive behavioral psychologists teach that our implicit
biases are more likely to emerge and influence our decision making
[[when we]{.mark} are required to [make fast decisions]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} when we [have broad discretion, rather than a defined
structure]{.mark}, about how to make that decision]{.underline}.60 Thus,
"\[t\]he [[speed]{.underline}]{.mark} of the plea bargaining process
itself [[makes it]{.mark} more [likely]{.mark} that the [implicit
racial]{.mark} biases]{.underline}" of public defenders and prosecutors
may [emerge]{.underline} [and]{.underline} further
**[[prejudice]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[the]{.mark} plea
[negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}.61 Moreover, the broad discretion of
the prosecutor to decide the appropriate contours of the plea and
sentence make it more likely that the prosecutor's implicit racial bias
will emerge and demand more punitive and harsher sentences for Black
defendants. 62 Consequently[, the speed and lack of procedural structure
in plea bargaining make it more likely that the implicit racial biases
of the public defenders and prosecutors will contaminate the plea
bargaining process]{.underline}. 63 C. Retributive Justice Focus Narrows
the Justice Options For the most part, the plea bargaining focus
maintains a narrow focus on retributive justice: what is the appropriate
amount of prison time a defendant should serve for the crime committed?
Retributive justice focuses on punishment at the exclusion of
rehabilitation.64 This narrow focus precludes a broader understanding of
why, if at all, the defendant committed the crime, and what are possible
responsive options for the defendant to acknowledge and take
responsibility for the crime committed.65 Moreover, since retributive
justice is doled out by the state, there is no meaningful input from the
community or the victim. 66 Thus, the focus on retributive justice in
plea bargaining race narrows the possible value added that could be had
if plea bargaining race was expanded to include a restorative justice
focus. 67 D. Negotiation Scholars: Plea Bargaining As Practiced Ignores
Good Negotiation Practice Plea bargaining scholars have called out to
prosecutors and public defenders to heed the lessons taught by
negotiation scholars and integrate the lessons into their plea
bargaining process. 68 As one lesson, renowned negotiation scholar
William Ury states that in effective negotiations, it is vital to "go
slow to go fast."69 In other words, plea bargaining race, as in all
negotiations, requires a slower, more deliberate process to achieve a
more equitable justice outcome. 70 As part of a slower negotiation
process, public defenders and prosecutors must prepare for the
negotiation.71 Part of that preparation for plea bargaining race
includes figuring out each side's prioritized interests, 72 considering
viable options,73 using objective standards to help select an option,74
and identifying the best alternative to a negotiated agreement if your
plea bargaining fails.75 It is important to note that [racial
bias]{.underline}, like any bias, [contributes to making plea bargaining
a subjective process swayed by the preferences of the]{.underline}
negotiators, the public defenders, and [prosecutors]{.underline}. 76
Therefore, objective data about the ultimate sentences received by other
similarly situated white defendants will help keep the race plea
bargaining process a fairer process in which Black defendants do not
receive harsher sentences than their white counterparts who committed a
similar crime. 77 Negotiation scholars also advise how to shift the
traditional in person plea bargaining process from a positional one in
which public defenders and prosecutors trade charges and sentences back
and forth to an interest-based negotiation in which public defenders and
prosecutor share information and problem-solve to arrive at an equitable
and responsive justice resolution rather than just going back and forth
about acceptable charges and sentences. 78 Rather than have a case be
just one more file to dispense with among an overflowing pile of case
files, together the public defender and prosecutor should meet to
consider the justice options for a particular case. 79 A central
distinction in an interest-based negotiation is that the prosecutor and
public defender share information.80 According to an interest-based plea
bargaining process, the prosecutor readily shares all evidence,
including exculpatory evidence, with the goal of working with the public
defender to arrive at an equitable resolution.81 A public defender
participating in an interest-based plea bargaining shares information
about the defendant that helps humanize the defendant, explain any
extenuating circumstances, and contribute to the public defender's
independent investigation. Together the prosecutor and public defender
consider what is a just, equitable resolution for each defendant, given
the particular circumstances of their case. How likely is it that public
defenders and prosecutors actually implement these plea bargaining
changes? The remainder of the paper will discuss how these changes are
being implemented and how progressive prosecutors are creating reform in
the criminal justice culture that incentivize prosecutors and public
defenders to implement these plea bargaining process changes. III. P

The United States fought back against the drug epidemic and gun violence
with its War on Drugs. During the War on Drugs, the United States
enacted punitive policing policies, stricter drug laws that penalized
drug possession with the same severity as drug dealing, and mandatory
minimum sentencing.138 The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,
which included the Sentencing Reform Act, was one such sweeping criminal
justice reform to accomplish these ends.139 The Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was another.140 All of these criminal
interventions had a racially disparate impact on African Americans. War
was being waged, and African Americans were now presumed guilty, rather
than innocent.141 They endured repeated unprovoked searches and
pretextual traffic stops.142 African American imprisonment rates were
greater than those of Stalin's Soviet Union.143 The push for these
criminal policies came not only from white politicians and their
constituents, but also from Black officials and the Black middle
class.144 What does it say about our country that the response to this
drug crisis was with criminal solutions rather than root-cause
solutions?145 Both white and Black supporters failed to predict that
these measures would have such a racially disparate impact on poor,
Black communities.146 Many consider these draconian criminal measures a
leading cause of the racialized mass incarceration that exists today.
William J. Stuntz reminds us that the mass incarceration of Black people
today is, in fact, slavery.147 First, "[[incarceration is a **form of
slavery**]{.underline}]{.mark}."148 The Thirteenth Amendment provides,
"\[n\]either slavery, nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment
for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist
in the United States."149 However, because [African
American]{.underline} male defendants are forced to navigate a
racialized criminal justice system, too many [are deprived of a fair and
just process and often **unduly** convicted]{.underline}. Second,
prisoners, like enslaved people, are subjugated to the will of their
jailers.150 Prison is all about subjugation, not rehabilitation. Third,
[incarceration, like slavery, is a way of [controlling the poorest,
least]{.mark} [educated]{.mark}]{.underline}.151 Part of the subjugation
is keeping the incarcerated poor and uneducated. A disproportionate
number of black prisoners who are incarcerated do not receive the
adequate training or education necessary to reenter the world as
contributing citizens. Fourth, prisoners, like enslaved people, are
unable to vote and decide who is chosen to rule. Even when Black people
are finished serving their prison sentences, they remain shackled to
their incarcerated status.152 Finally, as with the fear that surrounded
ending slavery, a fear exists about reform efforts to reduce the number
of incarcerated people.153 Thus, prison reform efforts to end the mass
incarceration of Black men are blocked by entrenched, racialized fears.
Professor Sheldon Evans offers a different analogy to illustrate how the
racialized justice outcomes of our criminal justice system are a
continuation of the discriminatory values underlying slavery. Professor
Evans notes a sobering link between how society perpetuated slavery and
our modern law enforcement system.154 "So, like the '[slave catcher'
roots of our modern police force, law enforcement are incentivized to
catch 'criminals' in African American communities]{.underline}, as their
slave catching predecessors were, [to return them to the racial
hierarchy]{.underline} that maintained what they saw as a proper balance
in society."155 [The]{.underline} modern system of [criminal
justice]{.underline} [enforcement]{.underline} in the United States
[is]{.underline} in many ways [a continuation of]{.underline} a
[slavery]{.underline} system [that fosters racialized discrimination
against African American male defendants]{.underline}. In the following
part of this Section, the author will explain how the racialized
presumption of guilt took hold in the plea-bargaining process. B. THE
EVOLUTION OF PLEA BARGAINING AND THE RACIALIZED PRESUMPTION OF GUILT
Plea bargaining is when a criminal defendant offers to plead guilty in
return for concessions in the offenses charged and the sentences
imposed.156 This Part chronicles the evolution of plea bargaining. When
plea bargaining finally became the primary justice resolution process
for criminal cases, the legal actors involved continued to be influenced
by the discriminatory animus that historically contaminated the criminal
justice system. This discriminatory animus helped to shape the
presumption of guilt towards African American male defendants and
involve it in plea bargaining. Plea bargaining scholars disagree about
when plea bargaining began to be used in the criminal justice system.157
One reason for this disagreement is that it is difficult to ascertain if
a guilty plea before trial was a result of a plea bargain.158 Moreover,
during the early 1800s, courts disfavored and discouraged guilty
pleas.159 There were multiple reasons for the distrust of guilty pleas.
First, from as far back as the 1600s, guilty pleas were often coerced by
the King.160 Second, there were concerns that the guilty plea might be
entered by an innocent person who just was fearful, hopeless, or
forgetful.161 Third, many defendants did not have attorneys.162 Fourth,
at that time, the punishment for committing a felony was death, so
defendants were less likely to voluntarily plead guilty to felony
charges. 163 Another reason it is difficult to determine the exact
moment plea bargaining began is that it is difficult to distinguish
between implicit and explicit plea bargaining.164 Implicit plea bargain
refers to when "there is no actual bargaining but defendants realize
they are better off if they plead guilty."165 "Hence defendants who
plead guilty strike a kind of bargain even though no word of a 'deal'
has been spoken."166 The first regular use of plea bargaining is said to
have taken place during the attempted resolution of Massachusetts liquor
cases in 1824.167 The structure of the liquor law provided a defined
dollar penalty for each enumerated offense, depriving judges of any
sentencing discretion.168 Prosecutors, however, had discretion. Unlike
judges, prosecutors were able to use that discretion and charge
defendants with lesser offenses that came with a lower dollar
penalty.169 Yet, during the 1800s there was no pressing need to
mainstream plea bargaining. During that time, the criminal system was
not yet professionalized and rendering justice was simpler than it is
today. Public prosecutors worked part-time, and during the course of the
1800s, the police were first introduced as part of law enforcement.170
Even during the late 1800s, the trial process was still simple and
brief.171 A trial would last less than thirty minutes.172 During the
trial, each side could present one or two witnesses before a jury
rendered a verdict.173 There were still part-time prosecutors and no
fingerprint or ballistic technology.174 It was not until the 1920s that
explicit plea bargaining took hold.175 Multiple reasons contributed to
plea bargaining's acceptance. First, the criminal justice system became
more professionalized with the increased prevalence of police,
prosecutors, and defense lawyers.176 This contributed to the court's
greater comfort with guilty pleas. Second, criminal law was also being
shaped by the introduction of "the bondsman, the ward politician, the
newspaper reporter, the jailer, and the fixer."177 Third, there was an
expansion of the criminal law.178 Fourth, with growing urbanization,
there was a concomitant growth in crime.179 Particularly, there was a
growth of victimless crimes such as liquor-prohibition cases that were
harder to convict.180 Fifth, as political corruption infiltrated the
criminal justice system, a "fixer" of some political influence, police
officers, and court officers were all instrumental in helping procure
pleas.181 Sixth, and finally, trials became longer and more complicated,
making pleas a more efficient option.182 One significant and unexpected
change caused by the professionalization of our criminal justice system
is that [the presumption of innocence]{.underline} that had always
existed until a defendant was proven guilty at the conclusion of a trial
[was replaced with a presumption of guilt when an arrest was
made]{.underline} by the police and prosecutors who brought charges.183
[[This **presumption of**]{.mark} **[guilt]{.mark}**, [combined with
racial animus]{.mark} towards African American defendants, [made plea
bargaining]{.mark} for African American men]{.underline} a
**[[risky]{.underline}]{.mark}** justice choice. Thus, the danger of
plea bargaining is that [[the]{.mark} "factually [innocent]{.mark} may
be convicted" because they have [negotiated away]{.mark} the protection
of [their trial]{.mark} [rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.184 Not only did
plea bargaining grow, but so did guilty pleas. Researchers note that
during the 1920s more convictions came from guilty pleas than bench or
jury trials.185 There were several reasons that defendants pleaded
guilty. First, prosecutors promised those already in jail that their
case would be dealt with quickly if they pleaded guilty. If they did
not, they would suffer long delays. Second, defendants were often
represented by young, appointed lawyers who lacked experience and
received little compensation.186 Thus, these lawyers encouraged their
clients to plead guilty rather than suffer through a trial. Third,
"court officers," also known as "plead getters," would frighten
defendants who were already in prison to plead guilty or face the
horrors of trial and a longer sentence.187 As plea bargaining began to
take hold, it attracted both supporters and critics.188 Plea bargaining
concerned the Progressives because it was ripe for prosecutorial
corruption and allowed criminals a "pass" from receiving punishment that
actually corresponded to the seriousness of their crimes.189 The
Realists, however, regarded plea bargaining as a necessary way to
efficiently deal with burgeoning caseloads, and they prevailed.190
Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brady v. United States,
which came down at a time when it was estimated that 90 to 95 percent of
convictions were the result of pleas, assuaged Progressives' concerns
and adopted protections to ensure that guilty pleas were voluntary and
not coerced.191 In Brady, the Court held that pleas were acceptable so
long as the defendant had competent counsel, there were no threats or
false promises made while negotiating the plea, and the defendant made
the plea "intelligently."192 However, [the line between what is coerced
and what is voluntary is blurry]{.underline}193 [and]{.underline} [has
not been applied in a racially-neutral way]{.underline}. In fact, a
closer look at state and U.S. Supreme Court decisions shows that [courts
historically demeaned African American defendants and regarded them as
"ignorant negroes" to justify providing African Americans with
procedural justice protections during and after the
1960s]{.underline}.194 For example, the Supreme Court's decision in
Gideon v. Wainwright, which recognized a defendant's right to counsel in
felony criminal cases, did not help African Americans combat the
institutional racism that denied them equal justice under the law.195 A
lawyer was not sufficient protection to help African American defendants
overcome their lack of an affluent family, social network, and credible
witnesses---all of which are societal privileges that help defend
against criminal charges and avoid conviction.196 From the 1970s onward,
[the U.S. criminal justice system established plea bargaining as vital
because efficiency became a priority at the expense of
rights]{.underline}.197 McConville and Mirsky posited that [[plea
bargaining's]{.mark} [usefulness was]{.mark} that it was [a socially
acceptable way of "imposing control and discipline"
on]{.mark}]{.underline} those "highly visible sections of society, those
who are perceived as dangerous because of their lack of involvement in
an acceptable labor market and the intensity of their involvement with
the criminal justice system."198 Under this model, the police are
proactive, rather than reactive, using surveillance and sweeps to target
[[people of color]{.underline}]{.mark}.199 All the legal actors
understand that there is a presumption of guilt.200 [Defense lawyers may
not interview witnesses or conduct further negotiations if the system
presumes their client is]{.underline} [guilty]{.underline}.201
"[[Subordination and degradation"]{.mark} were the tools used to
[convince defendants to plead guilty]{.mark}]{.underline}.202 By the
1990s, certain scholars characterized the U.S. criminal justice system
"a steroid era in criminal justice."203 When Congress adopted mandatory
minimum sentences and sentencing guidelines, it made plea bargaining an
even more attractive option.204 Today, plea bargaining is the criminal
justice system for many, with little constraint or oversight. Three
recent Supreme Court cases cast a crumb of hope that the Court
recognizes the need for court guidance on plea bargaining.205 Yet, as we
saw with Gideon and other laws and decisions, these decisions will not
help African American defendants claim their justice rights if these
decisions are applied in a racially biased way. II. THE PERPETUATION OF

the broader consequences of prison expansion by focusing on its
contribution to contemporary racial ideologies and structures of
economic disadvantage. While other scholars have argued that ideological
beliefs about African American criminality have facilitated their
disproportionately high rates of imprisonment, this article argues that
[ideological beliefs about race are]{.underline} also [informed by
African American men's disproportionately high rates of
incarceration]{.underline}. [Mass incarceration produces **structures of
disadvantage**]{.underline}, [as economic disparities are magnified

operates as a contemporary mechanism of racialization]{.underline}---a
structure [for continuing social stigma and economic marginalization by
race]{.underline}---and illustrates this point by examining the impact
of incarceration stigma on labor market exclusion. I. INTRODUCTION The
election of Barack Obama to the United States presidency was heralded by
some as a symbol of the demise of the Jim Crow era socioeconomic and
cultural landscape that defined systems of justice, mobility, and daily
life for millions of African Americans along racial lines.1 Yet in every
state of the nation, a disproportionately high percentage of African
American men presently live under some kind of state or federally
mandated detainment.2 Just one year prior to the 2008 election, roughly
35% of incarcerated men in federal and state prisons and jails were
African American,3 although they comprised just over 12% of the total
non- incarcerated adult male population.4 Patterns of racial disparity
in 2008 were even more dramatic in states such as Massachusetts, where
African American men were incarcerated at eight times the rate of
non-Hispanic whites.5 In 2010, the U.S. prison population declined for
the first time since 1972,6 but this trend has not significantly changed
racial disparities in imprisonment. According to recent estimates,
African American males are imprisoned at an overall rate of nearly seven
times that of white males.7 The high rate of incarceration among African
American men is part of an overall trend in punishment defined by a
dramatic increase in the "carceral system"8 ---a term used to
characterize the legitimization and normalization of imprisonment as a
factor of social life.9 Yet the collateral consequences of increased
incarceration are most significant for African American men.10 According
to author Michelle Alexander, "More African Americans are under
correctional control today---in prison or jail, on probation or on
parole---than were enslaved in 1850, before the Civil War began."11
Moreover, a long list of "invisible punishments," such as housing loss,
labor market exclusion, and political disenfranchisement, continue to
plague former inmates long after release.12 Restrictions associated with
felony convictions meant that nearly 1.4 million African American men
were ineligible to vote in the 2008 presidential election which,
ironically, has been identified as a major turning point in American
race relations and has led many to conclude that race is no longer a
significant factor in social or economic progress in the United
States.13 But, this type of "end-of-race" rhetoric14 ignores the
continued social and economic disenfranchisement of millions of African
American men by recasting it as a racially neutral, color-blind
occurrence that is the lone outcome of individual choice. The reality is
that mass incarceration dominates the social and economic context of
life for millions of African Americans, and continues a historical
pattern of structural disadvantage that is defined by race. Scholar
Manning Marable identifies the criminal justice system as one of three
pillars forming a deadly triangle of "institutional racism."15 Alexander
agrees with this characterization, arguing "mass incarceration has
established a 'racial caste system' in society, primarily driven by
politics, not crime."16 Others claim that while historical "Jim Crow"17
barriers have been abolished, criminal justice policies and procedures
that stress incarceration as a means of social control continue to
challenge basic U.S. principles of democracy and justice, especially for
the significant amount of affected individuals involved in non-violent
crimes.18 These critiques have led to calls for an evaluation of the
cultural effects of prison expansion, both in terms of its emphasis on
violence and dehumanization as a means for solving social conflicts, and
the policing policies and political slogans that focus on a so-called
"war" on crime.19 This is particularly problematic when such wars are
disproportionately fought in communities of color and members of those
communities are targeted as the primary criminals and victims.20 Others
contend that the punitive ideology that justifies contemporary forms of
punishment reify the eugenic arguments embraced by classical
criminologists that there is a dangerous class of criminals.21 Such
essentialist ideology is used not only to justify the unequal treatment
of members of socially disadvantaged groups within systems of criminal
justice, but also to justify their devalued status in all areas of
social life.22 This article examines the broader consequences of prison
expansion by focusing on its contribution to contemporary racial
ideologies and structures of economic disadvantage. Part II explores
recent writings on racialization, criminal stigma, and incarceration.
Racialization is defined as a process that reproduces and magnifies
racial classifications as structures of inequality within interlocking
ideologies, institutions, social systems, and everyday practices.23
While other scholars have argued that ideological beliefs about African
American male criminality have facilitated their disproportionately high
rates of imprisonment,24 this article argues that [[ideological
beliefs]{.mark} about race [are]{.mark} also [informed by]{.mark}
African American men's disproportionately [high rates of
incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline}. Correspondingly, the [[economic
disadvantages]{.mark} that lead a large number of African American men
to jail and prison cells [are **reproduced**]{.mark} and magnified [by
mass incarceration to produce]{.mark} **[systemic]{.mark}** economic
[disparities along racial lines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately, this
article proposes that contemporary ideas about race and structural-level
racial disparities are heavily informed by the stigma and economic
marginalization produced in mass incarceration. Part III illustrates
this point by examining the impact of incarceration stigma on labor
market exclusion. Research is presented to show that the ideological
link between incarceration and race is so pervasive that race and a
record of incarceration are often conflated as mutually reinforcing
forms of labor market bias experienced by African American men.25 This
article makes the case that the relationship between racial ideology and
economic marginalization is made possible by mass incarceration's close
structural relationship to other social systems, such as labor markets,
which magnify these forms of racial disadvantage. In this light, mass
incarceration operates as a contemporary mechanism of racialization. II.
INCARCERATION AS A MECHANISM OF RACIALIZATION \[T\]he role of [[the
carceral institution]{.underline}]{.mark} today is different in that,
for the first time in US history, it [[has]{.mark} been elevated to the
rank of [**main machine** for "race making]{.mark}]{.underline}". [Its
**material stranglehold** and classificatory activity have assumed a
salience and reach that are **wholly unprecedented** in]{.underline}
American history as well as unparalleled in [any other
society]{.underline}.26 In this statement, Loïc Wacquant discusses
[[the]{.mark} criminal [justice system]{.mark} [as a]{.mark} [**major**
site of racialization]{.mark}]{.underline}---a term defined by
sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant as "[the extension of racial
meaning to a previously racially unclassified relationship, social
practice or group]{.underline}."27 Racial classifications are forms of
inequality that use physical differences to define and rank groups on
the basis of status, power, and access to resources.28 Racial
classifications are realized through "racial projects," which are
described by Omi and Winant in the following manner: A racial project is
simultaneously an interpretation, representation, or explanation of
racial dynamics, and an effort to reorganize and redistribute resources
along particular racial lines. Racial projects connect what race means
in a particular discursive practice and the ways in which both social
structures and everyday experiences are racially organized, based upon
that meaning.29 In other words, racial projects are where racial
ideology meets structural disadvantage to form structural patterns of
racial inequality. Omi and Winant discuss slavery, Jim Crow laws, and
exclusionary immigration policies as examples of "racial projects"
within the United States that have used the legal system to reproduce
and control essentialist notions of race in order to establish and
maintain structures of social and economic hierarchy.30 For some, [the
criminal justice system]{.underline} has simply
**[replaced]{.underline}** [slavery and segregation as a contemporary
racial project]{.underline}.31 Indeed, this perspective argues that [the
criminal justice system is "inherently racialized" [as a result of the
disproportionate]{.mark} [representation of people of color "as]{.mark}
both [victims and perpetuators of crime]{.mark}]{.underline}."32
Wacquant builds on this idea, but focuses on the race and class dynamics
involved in the expansion of the carceral system.33 He argues that the
term "mass incarceration" obscures race by erroneously conceptualizing
African American men's disproportionate involvement in the criminal
justice system as an unfortunate, unintended consequence of widely cast
policies and procedures, rather than the outcome of racially focused
policies and practices: \[T\]he expansion and
[intensification]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the activities of the
police, courts, and [prison]{.underline} over the past quarter-century
have been anything but broad and indiscriminate. They [have been finely
targeted]{.underline}, first by class, second by [that disguised brand
of ethnicity called race]{.underline}, and third by place. [This
cumulative targeting has led to the **hyperincarceration**
of]{.underline} one particular category, [lower-class black African
American men trapped in the crumbling ghetto, while leaving the rest of
society]{.underline}---including, most remarkably, middle- and
upper-class African Americans---[practically
**untouched**]{.underline}.34 As Wacquant contends, high rates of
incarceration are often driven by class dynamics, as poverty is a
prevailing factor among the incarcerated.35 Although it often said, "the
poor get prison,"36 statistics indicate that [African Americans bear the
brunt of punitive policies that feature incarceration]{.underline}.37
Studies have exposed large scale patterns of racial disparity in
sentencing, where, as a consequence of departures from sentencing
guidelines, African American males with low levels of education are more
likely to be incarcerated, receive longer sentences, or are less likely
to receive a no-prison option when it is available, than similar
whites.38 Racial disparities in sentencing have been explained by some
as a consequence of African American men's higher rates of arrest and
participation in serious, violent crimes, rather than discriminatory
policies or judgments.39 Yet, after reviewing forty studies published
since 1980 that investigate racial bias in sentencing, a report compiled
by the Sentencing Project maintains that [type and severity of crime do
not fully explain racial disparities in sentencing
outcomes]{.underline}.40 On the contrary, [the report found greater
racial disparities in sentencing]{.underline} (in terms of type of
judgment and length of sentence) [for less serious crimes, such as low
level drug offenses and property crimes]{.underline}. "There is evidence
of direct racial discrimination (against minority defendants in
sentencing outcomes)," the report concluded.41 Using the discussion of
racialization and racial projects as a foundation,42 we can think about
mass incarceration as a racial project that operates as a mechanism of
racialization. This view should be contrasted from one that
conceptualizes the criminal justice system as a racial project and sees
mass incarceration as an outcome of that process of racialization.43 As
defined earlier, racialization is a process that reproduces and
magnifies racial classifications as structures of inequality within
interlocking ideologies, institutions, social systems, and everyday
practices.44 The criminal justice system is comprised of a collection of
institutions, processes, and procedures that facilitate mass
incarceration. African American men's dis- proportionate relationship to
[[the]{.mark} criminal [justice system]{.mark}]{.underline} is a
function of mutually reinforcing processes of race and class
stratification that [[**construct** African American]{.mark}
[males]{.mark}, as a racialized group, [in a position of **devalued**,
**marginalized** social status]{.mark} in society]{.underline}.45 But it
is mass incarceration---the outcome---where racial ideology meets
structural disadvantage, thereby embedding African Americans in a web of
social and economic disadvantage not experienced by other racial groups,
regardless of their levels of criminal involvement. Racial ideology is a
key factor in how mass incarceration operates as a mechanism of
racialization. Racial ideology is informed by status and power
differentials and operates as both the facilitator and byproduct of the
convergence of race and class stratification.46 Professor Eduardo
Bonilla-Silva states: "[[Racial stereotypes are **crystallized**]{.mark}
at the ideological level of a social system]{.underline}. [[These
images]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately indicate (although in distorted
ways) and [[justify]{.mark} the [stereotyped group's position]{.mark} in
a society]{.underline}."47 When considering the lack of collective
public concern over the excessive rates of incarceration among young
African American men, [the stigma of black-male criminality associated
with their devalued status may act as a core part of the
**common-sense** understandings that most Americans have about African
American men.]{.underline}48 Thus,
"[[stigmatization]{.underline}]{.mark} is not merely the drawing of a
negative surmise about someone's productive attributes," but instead
[[involves]{.mark} the "[virtual social]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[identity]{.underline}]{.mark}" [that stems from negative meanings
ascribed to race and structured racial inequality]{.underline}.49 This
has led some to point out that [the collective identity of African
American male criminality developed to justify slavery has now been
ingrained in the structure of institutions, interactional conventions,
and individual perceptions of reality within American
society]{.underline}.50 Significant research shows that racial
stereotypes play an important role in public perceptions of African
Americans and crime.51 What may be surprising for some, however, is the
demonstrated link between perceptions of race and support for punitive
crime policies that result in incarceration.52 One study indicated that
white respondents who embraced racial stereotypes were generally more
likely to support harsh punitive sanctions, such as the death penalty
and longer prison sentences.53 The study also found that support for
harsh punishment measures varied with the race of offenders.54 In
particular, whites are more likely to support punitive measures for
African American offenders than white offenders for the same crimes.55
No doubt, racial biases can be heavily influenced by media images that
portray African Americans as criminogenic---especially local news
broadcasts that display more images of African American suspects than
other racial groups in handcuffs, receiving guilty sentences in court
proceedings, or other images suggesting their culpability in serious
crimes.56 In one study, white non-college educated adults were shown a
local news broadcast of a crime story where the skin color of the male
suspect was manipulated.57 Afterwards, they were asked a series of
questions about crime control policies.58 Respondents were more likely
to support punitive policies when the perpetrator was depicted as
African American than when the perpetrator was racially ambiguous or
white.59 In another study, researchers constructed a punitive index poll
that included questions concerning support for three strikes laws,
parole, trying juveniles as adults, and harsher penalties for violent
offenders.60 Results of this study also revealed that whites are
generally more likely than African Americans to support punitive crime
policies.61 This same study claimed that racial prejudice can explain
support for harsher penalties among whites, while perceived racial
injustice helps explain African Americans' lack of support for such
policies: "Whites' and Blacks' attitudes towards crime policies are
associated with their social structural location vis-à-vis the criminal
justice system."62 In other words, perceptions of one's personal
experiences and the experiences of other members of one's racial group
within the criminal justice system inform one's perceptions about the
individual and collective experiences of members of other racial groups
within the criminal justice system. Thus, public perception is not only
affected by racial stereotypes of perceived criminality, but also
informs public support of incarceration along racial lines. This raises
an important point about the consequences of mass incarceration that has
significant implications for race, particularly in the case of African
Americans. While racialized perceptions of criminality may have a strong
effect on attitudes about race or crime, criminality suggests the
potential for criminal activity that may be associated with a multitude
of racial or ethnic groups.63 For example, Italians are often associated
with potential criminality based on stereotypes about their
disproportionate involvement in organized crime, often as a consequence
of popular characters in films and television shows.64 However, as
stated in the aforementioned research, perceptions of criminality for
African Americans are informed by devalued class status, devalued racial
status, and a large-scale pattern of disproportionate involvement within
a formal, institutionalized criminal justice system.65 Perceptions of
incarceration are thus not simply about racially neutral perceptions of
potential criminality. Instead, incarceration stigma is racialized and
is most often directed towards African American men.66 Race, then, is
"embedded in the very foundation of our criminal law . . . . \[and\]
helps to determine who the criminals are, what conduct constitutes a
crime, and which crimes society treats most seriously."67 For example,
one study finds that [[evaluators]{.mark} pressed to [estimate the race
of former inmates]{.mark} are much more likely to identify them [as
"black"]{.mark} than other racial groups]{.underline}, even when the
race of that inmate appears to be mixed or ambiguous.68 Moreover, the
same study found that [many [ex- inmates]{.mark} [who]{.mark}
self-[identified]{.mark} themselves [as "mixed]{.mark}" or "ambiguous"
[before]{.mark} serving [time]{.mark} were likely to
self-[identify]{.mark} themselves [as "black" after being
incarcerated]{.mark}]{.underline}.69 This finding led the researchers to
conclude that [incarceration has a racializing effect on individuals
that can be linked to the proliferation of stereotypes about African
American male criminality.]{.underline}70 I argue, however, that it is
not the association with criminality that affects perceptions of race.
Alternatively, it is modern processes and structures of
institutionalization---in an era of mass incarceration that
disproportionately features African American men---that have a
significant impact on perceptions of race. It is incarceration, not
criminality, where racial ideology and economic inequality intersect to
magnify structural level racial disparities. Because African Americans
are disproportionately more likely to be institutionalized,71 [their
high rate of physical location in jails and prisons brings race to what
might otherwise be racially neutral physical space]{.underline}, a
process referred to earlier in this article as racialization.72 Their
disproportionate presence in positions of social and economic
disadvantage also racializes the processes, expectations, interactions,
and stigma commonly associated with that space. Unlike the stigma of
criminality, the stigma of incarceration is based on a perception of an
individual or group that has been systematically accused, arrested,
prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned for committing a crime. Embedded
in this stigma is an assumption that formal, organized, and color-blind
legal procedures can address any questions of criminality in a carceral
system based on truth, justice, and consequences.73 Incarceration
stigma, then, provides a rationale for stereotypes about potential
criminality by grounding them in a structural, physical reality. At the
ground level, [[mass incarceration acts as]{.mark} a form of [social and
residential **segregation**]{.mark}---that is, the removal of large
numbers of African American men from their communities to "reside"
within penal institutions]{.underline}.74 Meanwhile, [the
[removal]{.mark} of large numbers of African American men from urban
underclass neighborhoods [adds to the]{.mark}
**[stigmatization]{.mark}** of those neighborhoods]{.underline},
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[results in]{.mark} increased
racial segregation and [devalued status]{.mark} of those
spaces]{.underline}.75 Recent legal disputes involving the political and
social implications of how and where prisoners are counted for census
and redistricting purposes provide evidence that this population is
racialized and manipulated though formal social controls.76 Because
mechanisms of stratification do not operate in isolation,77 [mass
incarceration **reproduces** devalued status and patterns of racial
disadvantage throughout other areas of society]{.underline}. Part III
illustrates this by discussing how the ideological and physical
constrictions of mass incarceration are reproduced in the labor market
experiences of young, poor African American men. III. INCARCERATION
STIGMA, RACE, AND LABOR MARKET EXCLUSION

#### Plea bargaining is a tool of racist mass incarceration that has created the worst criminal system in the history of the world- it incentivizes police to hunt down poor minorities and constructs Blackness as equal to criminality

**Canon 23** \[Dan Canon, civil rights lawyer and a professor of law at
the University of Louisville, Louis D. Brandeis School of Law. He served
as lead counsel for the Kentucky plaintiffs in the case of Obergefell v.
Hodges, which established marriage equality in all 50 states, and has

Despite such stark statistics, there is no shortage of commentators who
steadfastly refuse to see what's right in front of them. As populations
of people of color surged in U.S. prisons, scholars rushed to assure the
public that there was "No Racism in the Justice System." Even as Breonna
Taylor was shot and killed in her own home based on a bogus search
warrant, and George Floyd was murdered in full view of the public,
conservative pundits furiously penned op-eds about "The Myth of Systemic
Police Racism." Visit any comment thread on a local news article to see
what the general public thinks, and it's always some version of the same
old trope: Be a good citizen, do whatever the nice officer says and
you'll be fine. But [individual choices and behaviors cannot override a
bad system]{.underline}, [no matter how "good" the citizen]{.underline}.
What's wrong with the system itself? The simplest answer to this
question is: volume. Take arrest rates as but one example. In 2019,
British law enforcement arrested about 1,200 out of every 100,000
people. In Australia, it was about 1,600. In the United States, the
number was more than 3,000. [[By]{.mark} nearly [any criminal justice
metric]{.mark} --- be it arrest, conviction or incarceration rates ---
[the U.S. is bigger]{.mark} ([and worse]{.mark}) [than any other
civilization in the **history of the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
only true explanation for this anomaly is that the mechanisms of the
U.S. state have artificially created an abundance of so-called
criminals]{.underline}. In my book, Pleading Out: How Plea Bargaining
Creates a Permanent Criminal Class, I argue that [[the state's chief
criminal-creating mechanism is the plea bargain]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The U.S. is unique in that [more than 95 percent of all criminal cases
end in a plea bargain]{.underline}. [No other country comes anywhere
close]{.underline}. Our uniqueness in plea bargaining has led us to
uniquely bad outcomes. [We couldn't have gotten these astronomical
numbers of system-involved people without a method of getting lots of
convictions quickly]{.underline}, and [that's what the plea bargain
is]{.underline}. Shameka Parrish-Wright, a bail reform activist and the
director of VOCAL-KY, an organization that provides support to
low-income people in the criminal legal system, explained: "While doing
bail reform work ... I ran into so many people right before they were
about to decide on taking a plea deal.... I remember working with public
defenders and other defense attorneys to pay bails and get people out
before accepting terrible plea deals. [[Plea deals build prisons and
keep people incarcerated]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Plea deals also feed the
probation and parole system]{.underline}, which needs a complete
overhaul." But why should plea bargaining lead to racist outcomes? This
answer requires a little more parsing. [[Because of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the prevalence of [[plea bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[police
know]{.underline}]{.mark} that [virtually [any arrest they make will end
in a conviction]{.mark}]{.underline}. This alone can lead to racially
unequal outcomes if you've got a racist cop who is only interested in
arresting people of color. [Since nearly every arrest is justified by
its inevitable conclusion]{.underline}, i.e. a plea bargain and
conviction, [an officer's motives are almost never meaningfully
questioned in court or anywhere else]{.underline}. The problem is more
complicated than that, though. Because [[their performance is]{.mark}
often [measured in]{.mark} number of [arrests]{.mark}]{.underline},
there is little incentive for any officer to exercise much on-the-job
caution. [[If a cop is told to arrest as many people as possible]{.mark}
every day]{.underline}, [[they will]{.mark} likely start
[look]{.mark}ing [in the poorest part of town]{.mark}]{.underline}.
That's not to say that poor people commit more crime than their suburban
counterparts --- they don't. But the arrestees harvested from the
poorest communities are the easiest prey for officers who need to meet
quotas because once they are sucked into the system, they often must
plead guilty to something or face even worse consequences than the
conviction itself. Think of it this way: [A cop would more likely arrest
someone who is likely to take a deal and get convicted quickly, rather
than someone with the means to post bail, prolong the process and hire
private lawyers to put the officer's behavior under a
microscope]{.underline}. Many of the [[poorer communities]{.mark} in the
U.S.]{.underline}, [especially in urban centers]{.underline}, [[are
populated by people of color]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is thanks in
large part to "redlining" practices which relegated Black people and
other people of color into the places that white people didn't want to
live]{.underline}. "[Often, people of color who reside in
under-resourced communities do not have the means to hire a private
attorney that will fight for a better outcome]{.underline}," explained
Melba Pearson, a former prosecutor and civil rights attorney who
specializes in policy. "Often, private attorneys have more investigators
at their disposal, will provide broader mitigation for a judge to
consider and can provide a more robust defense than a public defender
who has 2 -- 3 times the number of cases.... A public defender may
encourage their client to plea for fear of a harsher sentence at trial,
or a lack of resources to be able to investigate the case with a
fine-tooth comb despite the possibility of an acquittal." Thus, while
anyone of any race can be arrested at any time for anything (or for
nothing at all), [[the target on your back becomes bigger if you're
poor]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and bigger]{.mark} still [if you're poor
and Black]{.mark}]{.underline}. An officer need not be a member of the
Aryan Brotherhood to arrest a disproportionate number of people of
color; they need only follow a simple order to maximize the number of
arrests they make. CalvinJohn Smiley, professor of sociology at Hunter
College-City University of New York, explained how [[plea bargaining
racializes crime in **plain sight**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[immediately
affecting incarcerated youth]{.underline}]{.mark}. "The expectation is
that many of these [[young men]{.mark} who are [racialized as Black and
Latinx will]{.mark} eventually [succumb to a plea
agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, which typically occurs after spending a
year, if not more, within the juvenile facility. [[During that
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they are exposed to]{.mark} various forms
of [violence]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and if/when they turn 18 and
'catch a case' in the facility, often, will be transferred to \[an adult
jail\], which in turn places them at higher risk for exposure to
violence." Here's where the serpent swallows its tail: [[After
generations of unequal arrests of Black people]{.underline}]{.mark} for
everything under the sun, with most of those arrests ending in quick
convictions, [[many]{.mark} of the [players in the criminal legal
system]{.mark}]{.underline} --- including [cops, judges, prosecutors and
even defense attorneys]{.underline} --- [have come to **[equate
"Blackness" with "criminality."]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}Legal
scholar Carlos Berdejó described the practice of "using a defendant's
race \[an observable attribute\] as a proxy for the defendant's inherent
criminality \[an unobservable attribute\]." In other words, [[the law
has gotten so used to rapidly affixing the label of "criminal" to Black
people]{.mark} that [it assumes the Venn diagram between "Black" and
"criminal" is a **perfect circle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There's no easy
way to disrupt this process, but I believe it can be disrupted. The
first step is to recognize the mechanism that enables the harm. For
decades, the U.S. has been without a serious dialogue about basing an
entire criminal legal system on backroom "deals" that are sure to end in
convictions. It's time we started one.

Even the universe of human service agencies tasked with addressing
former prisoners needs---prisoner reentry programs in criminal justice
par- lance---are overwhelmingly located in these neighborhoods.63 As a
result, prisoners are now arrested from, returned to, and provided
rehabilitation services all within the low-rent districts they learn to
call home.64 While one could claim this phenomenon simply scratches an
itch---that is, pro- gramming is located in areas with great need---this
social arrangement raises important questions about the containment of
the criminalized poor in disadvantaged, largely urban spaces.
Furthermore, the proliferation of reentry programming as the
rehabilitative strategy of choice in the current age implicates the
loose networks of public and private welfare state actors and
organizations in the management and control of the criminalized poor.
While these more interventionist, community-based behavioral management
strategies speak to how a new series of actors and institutions have
emerged to manage the carceral citizen, urban policing practices speak
most clearly to how this group is sorted for criminal justice selection.
III. POLICING SUITABLE TARGETS Racial disparities in arrest and
incarceration are staggering. A recent study estimating arrest rates of
Black and White youth found that 49 per- cent of Black men will be
arrested for a non-traffic violation by their 23rd birthday, compared
with 38 percent of White men.65 A look across age categories reveals
that Blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as Whites66 and remain
six times more likely to be incarcerated. 67 Policing research has
consistently supported these findings and provides evidence of one
mecha- nism that explains them. Blacks and Latinos are stopped, frisked,
and ar- rested at much higher rates than Whites, although they represent
a smaller share of the general population and are less likely to have
weapons when searched.68 This pattern persists even when controlling for
suspects' actual involvement in the crimes for which they were
questioned 69 or for crime rates in the areas where they were stopped.
70 Put differently, racial dispari- ties in street-level criminal
justice contact remain even when controlling for the guilt of the
presumed offender, the racial descriptors used by crime victims to relay
who committed actual crimes, or the recent history of crimes committed
by members of their presumed racial group in the given area. At the same
time, law enforcement practices like "hot-spot"71 and "order
maintenance"72 policing ensure the concentration of police in poor,
racialized spaces. Thus, the kinds of crimes associated with the over-
whelmingly poor people that cycle in and out of jails and lockup
facilities, like drug use, public urination, and trespassing, are met by
arrests, fines, court fees, and eventual incarcerations, perpetuating
these trends. [Arrest records and misdemeanor offenses
alone]{.underline} are enough for some employers, government officials,
and landlords to [exclude the accused from jobs, housing, and government
licensure]{.underline}. 73 The [collateral consequences]{.underline} of
a felony conviction [are]{.underline} all the more
**[severe]{.underline}**, [excluding former prisoners from meaningful
participation in social, civic, and economic life]{.underline}.74 [The
long-term effects of imprisonment on poor racial and ethnic minorities
cannot be overstated]{.underline}. It is by now well known that [[Blacks
and Latinos]{.underline}]{.mark}, [at just **30 percent** of the U.S.
population]{.underline}, [[represent]{.mark} nearly [**60 percent**
of]{.mark} the nation's [prisoners]{.mark}]{.underline}.75 Subsequently,
[[they]{.mark} [disproportionately shoulder]{.mark} the [burdens]{.mark}
associated with imprisonment, which range from [chronic **unem-
ployment** and]{.mark} near-[**intractable poverty**, to housing
**instability** and poor]{.mark} health and mental [health care]{.mark}
access.]{.underline}76 If imprisonment rates were held constant, [nearly
[one in three Black men born]{.mark} after 2001 [would spend]{.mark}
some [time in]{.mark} jail or [prison]{.mark}, along with one in
eighteen Black women]{.underline}--- about [[**five times the** rate
of]{.mark} similarly situated [Whites]{.mark}]{.underline}. 77 More
insidious, [incarceration's spillover effects extend]{.underline} well
[beyond the suspected]{.underline} "legal of- fender,"78 [affecting
their partners, children, and extended family mem- bers.]{.underline} 79
Indeed, [**44 percent** of Black women and **32 percent** of Black men
have a family member who has been incarcerated]{.underline}, 80 while
[**one in nine** Black children has an incarcerated
parent]{.underline},81 extending disadvantage across generations.
[**[Carceral expansion]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} therefore
[facilitated]{.mark} the emergence of [an **im- poverished**,
**racialized**, and **denigrated** social category]{.mark} that is both
**materi- ally** and symbolically **stranded**]{.underline}. This is in
part due to shifting trends in liability law, making the owner,
employer, or state agency responsible for the conduct of those whom they
house, employ, or license. 82 It is also likely facilitated by the
emergence and proliferation of inexpensive crimi- nal background
checks83 and public expectations that responsible stake- holders will
access criminal records and withhold access to the criminalized poor.84
For whatever reasons these practices exist, once ar- rested, this group
becomes subject to legal practices that exclude them from full social,
civic, and economic participation. The concentration of criminal justice
resources in poor inner-city communities, coupled with the propensity of
police officers to stop, frisk, and arrest Black and Brown residents,
ensure that the people subject to these forms of exclusion are
disproportionately poor Black and Brown people. IV. ON RISK AND
RESPONSIBILITY Given the consequences associated with having a criminal
record, carceral expansion has produced a jobless, maligned, and
socially excluded class subject to the vagaries of a flexible economy,
the retrenchment of social welfare benefits, and the volatility of the
low-wage labor market.85 A recent report from the American Bar
Foundation revealed that nearly 45,000 laws restrict former prisoners'
mobility.86 The domain of these policies range from limiting the
franchise to diminishing access to housing, food, employment, and
education. 87 These legal restrictions dictate where former prisoners
can live, what kinds of occupations they can take up, and with whom they
can associate. 88 Further complicating matters, there are nowhere near
the community resources needed to adequately address the challenges
former prisoners face during reentry.89

This peculiar social arrangement has resulted from three key processes
that operate in formal and informal ways. First, the circulation of
people between confinement and disadvantaged communities exacerbate
already existing social inequalities, signaling greater police presence
and the repeated cycle of arrest and incarceration.31 Second, the mark
of a criminal record constrains the mobility of the criminalized poor,
activating third parties in their management and exclusion.32 Third,
"\[s\]hifts in social welfare and criminal justice policy have at once
hollowed out rehabilitative services and expanded the reach of the
state, ensuring that former prison- ers' family and friendship networks
are the resource of first and last resort in their transition from
prison back home." 33 II. PUTTING MASS SUPERVISION IN ITS PLACE
[[Carceral expansion]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [been]{.mark} theorized as [an
instrument of **domina- tion**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that promotes
**inequality**]{.mark} across class and racial strata]{.underline}34 and
as a geo- graphic solution used to address social problems. 35 [[The
prison]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with its corollary institutions of
surveillance and control, [have been viewed as]{.underline} a relatively
unified form of **[poverty governance]{.underline}**,36 producing
particular ways of being in the social world,37 and a regulatory valve,
disciplining low- wage workers. Wacquant finds that [these processes
[render poor]{.mark}, [unskilled Black laborers
"**redundant**]{.mark}"]{.underline} [through social exclusion, a
changing political economy, and the state's **abdication of
responsibility** for their social and economic outcomes]{.underline}. 38
[Unskilled [Black men are]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore the most
"[suita- ble targets]{.underline}" [for criminal justice intervention,
[selected]{.mark} first [by]{.mark} class, second by [race]{.mark}, and
third by geography]{.underline}.39 Wacquant's thesis is compelling.
[[More than **two-thirds** of former prisoners live]{.mark} at or
[below]{.mark} **[half]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} U.S. [pov- erty
line]{.mark}**]{.underline},40 [[with]{.mark} **[80 percent]{.mark}**
[qualify]{.mark}ing [as **indigent**]{.mark} for the purposes of legal
representation]{.underline}.41 [The [Black imprisonment rate is roughly
**six times** that of Whites]{.mark}]{.underline}42 [and]{.underline},
when incarcerated, [[Blacks serve **lengthier**
sentences]{.mark}.]{.underline} 43 Fur- thermore, states with stingier
welfare expenditures typically have higher rates of incarceration.44
Noting these trends, Wacquant admonishes schol- ars to "reconnect social
and penal policies" in order to "grasp the new politics of
marginality."45The outcomes associated with these "new politics" are
jarring. [Peo- ple in prison are overwhelmingly poor]{.underline}.46
[Half are estimated to have a diagnosable mental health
issue.]{.underline} 47 [A recent study found that former pris- oners are
129 times more likely to die of a drug overdose and twelve times more
likely to die of any other cause within just two weeks of their release
than members of the general population]{.underline}.48Straining federal,
state, and county budgets,49 [[mass incarceration ex-
tends]{.underline}]{.mark} a host of [burdens [to]{.mark} entire
[communities]{.mark} due to heightened rates of
**[unemployment]{.mark}**]{.underline},50 [the [loss of
wages]{.mark}]{.underline}, 51 [family]{.underline}
[disruption]{.underline},52 [[and]{.mark} the in- creased risk for
health and mental health problems associated with impris-
onment]{.underline}.53 For example, sociologist and demographer Evelyn
Patterson's recent study shows that for [every year an inmate serves in
prison he or she [loses]{.mark} up to **two years** of **[life
expectancy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 54 Further complicating matters,
[former prisoners are released into notoriously disadvantaged
spaces]{.underline}, and particularly [in]{.underline}to
[the]{.underline} so-called [inner city]{.underline}. 55 For example,
Paul Street's study of the effects of mass incarceration on poor
communities in Chicago re- vealed that [the neighborhoods where the
highest concentration of arrests took place were nearly **identical** to
the neighborhoods where most prison- ers returned]{.underline}.56
Criminologists and urban sociologists have found similar trends in large
cities across the nation.57 These spaces, which service providers refer
to as "[receiving commu- nities]{.underline},"58 are either the few
places willing to host former prisoners when they return, or they simply
[lack the political power to resist the return of prisoners to their
already disadvantaged spaces]{.underline}. Either way, in states like
Michigan, where the prison population exceeds 45,000, [nearly
[**one-third** of]{.mark} all [prisoners are arrested from and returned
to]{.mark} eight [disadvantaged zip codes]{.mark}]{.underline}, all of
which are within the Detroit city limits. 59 This is despite the city
representing just seven percent of the state's population.60 In
Illinois, where roughly 35,000 prisoners are annually discharged, more
than half return to Chicago and more than a third return to just six of
seventy-seven Chicago community areas.61 Mirroring national trends,
[these [neighbor- hoods have poverty, crime, and unemployment
rates]{.mark} at [**three times** the]{.mark} national [average]{.mark}.
[Black people]{.mark} [comprise]{.mark} no less than [**90 percent** of
these]{.mark} [neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, save two, where 90
percent of the residents were Black or Latino.62 Similar trends can be
found in most large cities. Even the universe of human service agencies
tasked with addressing former prisoners needs---prisoner reentry
programs in criminal justice par- lance---are overwhelmingly located in
these neighborhoods.63 As a result, [prisoners are now arrested from,
returned to, and provided rehabilitation services all within the
low-rent districts they learn to call home]{.underline}.64 While one
could claim this phenomenon simply scratches an itch---that is, pro-
gramming is located in areas with great need---this social arrangement
raises important questions about the containment of the criminalized
poor in disadvantaged, largely urban spaces. Furthermore, the
proliferation of reentry programming as the rehabilitative strategy of
choice in the current age implicates the loose networks of public and
private welfare state actors and organizations in the management and
control of the criminalized poor. While these more interventionist,
community-based behavioral management strategies speak to how a new
series of actors and institutions have emerged to manage the carceral
citizen, urban policing practices speak most clearly to how this group
is sorted for criminal justice selection. III. POLICING SUITABLE TARGETS

Carceral expansion has therefore facilitated the emergence of an
impoverished, racialized, and denigrated social category that is both
materially and symbolically stranded. This is in part due to shifting
trends in liability law, making the owner, employer, or state agency
responsible for the conduct of those whom they house, employ, or
license.82 It is also likely facilitated by the emergence and
proliferation of inexpensive criminal background checks83 and public
expectations that responsible stakeholders will access criminal records
and withhold access to the criminalized poor.84 For whatever reasons
these practices exist, once arrested, this group becomes subject to
legal practices that exclude them from full social, civic, and economic
participation. The concentration of criminal justice resources in poor
inner-city communities, coupled with the propensity of police officers
to stop, frisk, and arrest Black and Brown residents, ensure that the
people subject to these forms of exclusion are disproportionately poor
Black and Brown people. IV. ON RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY [Given the
consequences associated with having a criminal record, [**carceral
expansion** has produced a **jobless**, **maligned**, and **socially
excluded** class subject to]{.mark} the [vagaries of a flexible
economy]{.mark}, the [retrenchment of]{.mark} social [welfare benefits,

[and]{.mark} with [whom they can]{.mark}
[associate]{.mark}.]{.underline} 88 Further complicating matters, there
are nowhere near the community resources needed to adequately address
the challenges former prisoners face during reentry.89 [[Limited
availability of treatment, housing, employment, and mental health
services]{.mark} [facilitates the **reliance** of former prisoners
on]{.mark} already [vul- nerable]{.mark} [networks]{.mark} of
care]{.underline}. 90 [Prisoners']{.underline} [**families** are thereby
made responsi- ble to support them as they attempt to become integrated
in their home communities]{.underline}.91 At the same time, [their
**exclusion** from welfare benefits, sustainable labor, housing, and
education render their personal networks as the primary mechanism of
their rehabilitation, a role the state once]{.underline} at least
rhetorically [played]{.underline}.92 When the state does fund
rehabilitative programs, it does so through contracts with private
nonprofit, community-based vendors.93 [Despite]{.underline} increasing
in number during the age of mass supervision, [there are not enough
community-based prisoner reentry programs to ad- dress returning
prisoners' needs]{.underline}. 94 Thus, the state---represented by
correc- tions officers, the police, and the courts---has off-loaded its
capacity to respond to the needs of former prisoners onto the actors
least able to do so. This support network consists of other former
prisoners, their families, their community members, and the human
services agencies that attempt to address social problems associated
with incarceration through social ser- vice provision. As a result, the
rehabilitation of prisoners "has been out- sourced and privatized,
moving from within prison walls into the . . . church basements . . .
and community centers" of the post-industrial city. 95

From New York City to Los Angeles, federal housing mandates are
interpreted in such a way that a mother who allows her son to sleep on
her couch can be evicted if he has a felony. She takes this risk to
house him, but the stakes involved in caring for him may change how they
relate to one another. Furthermore, [[employers, landlords and social
service providers]{.mark} are subject to lawsuits or reputation loss
should an employee commit a crime on their premises]{.underline}.
[They]{.underline} therefore either exclude formerly incarcerated people
from services altogether or [**[cream]{.underline}**
[applicants]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [accommodating those considered
**least risky**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These cases show how
interpretations of [[liability]{.underline}]{.mark} law [[raise
the]{.mark} [risk]{.mark} for well-meaning family, friends and
professionals who help people with criminal records]{.underline} (See
Thacher 2008). In fact, there is a tacit expectation that they will
exclude them from services and care. With the advent of electronic
databases and the proliferation of what Sarah Lageson (2016) calls
"digital punishment", even convictions for low level offenses and arrest
records where charges are dropped are used as a reason to reject an
applicant. [Given the risks involved for supporters, public pressure to
fleece "criminals" from applicant rolls, and legal cover to
discriminate, providing help to formerly incarcerated people is consid-
ered beyond reasonable expectations and construed as a kind of
favor]{.underline} (Miller and Alexander, 2016). These favors are
connected to everyday modes of exchange, like hiring a qualified
candidate or providing a family member with a couch to sleep on, rais-
ing the consequences of everyday interactions for people with criminal
records. [These [practices endow]{.mark} caregivers, employers and other
[third]{.mark} [parties with **inordinate** power]{.mark}. This is
because third parties represent one of the few resources that carceral
citizens have access to, [introducing]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} kind of
[vulnerability where]{.mark} [the carceral citizen is subject to
the]{.mark} [**whims** of the people they encounter in everyday
life]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[even those whom they are clos- est
to]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A]{.mark}n argument]{.underline} with a
partner [or]{.underline} a [[misunderstanding]{.underline}]{.mark} with
a social worker [[could warrant]{.mark} a trip back to [prison]{.mark},
a night on the street or restricted access to food, work, healthcare or
their family]{.underline}. [This is not the case with]{.underline}
[[other]{.underline}]{.mark} marginalized [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}
[whose]{.underline} [access]{.underline} to goods, services and
stabilizing institutions [[are protected under the]{.mark} US
**[constitution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This combina- tion of
[**precarity** and **derision**]{.mark} [creates a **power
imbalance**]{.mark}, altering even the most intimate exchanges between
the formerly incarcerated and the most important people in their
lives.]{.underline} While there is a long literature on women's
incarceration, Susan Burton's powerful memoir, Becoming Ms. Burton
(Burton and Lynn, 2017), along with the recent and grow- ing literature
on the post prison experiences of black American women demonstrate the
profound and complex ways that black women uniquely experience this new
form of citi- zenship (Gurisami, 2017; Richie, 2012; Rumpf, 2014;
Threadcraft and Miller, this vol- ume). While a full accounting of the
criminalization of black women is beyond the scope of this article,
black women occupy a particularly precarious position in the social
land- scape that deserves scholarly attention. They are objects of and
subject to gendered forms of carceral citizenship, and remain targets of
criminal justice intervention and the main support system for their
formerly incarcerated partners, parents, siblings and children. Put
simply, black women experience a deep and trenchant form of
vulnerability to re- arrest, to housing instability, to disruption and
displacement, that has a cumulative effect that exacerbates their
precarity. Crime control filters into their family life, civic engage-
ment, friendships and professional networks of carceral citizens in
unique and powerful ways that vary by the "kind of person" who
experiences them. These practices have changed urban sociality, and with
it, the very nature of social interaction for the criminal- ized poor.
As such, the ways in which they experience citizenship is fundamentally
dif- ferent from the experiences of other marginalized groups.

#### Plea bargain driven mass incarceration causes racialized mass death from disease

Incarceration as a Public Health Issue Public health research and
principles have evolved an ever-broadening understanding of the forces
affecting health. Public health experts have adopted the Social
Determinants of Health framework to identify the multifaceted and
interconnected ways that our systems, institutions, communities, and
selves affect health at every level. From this perspective, the
discipline of public health has begun to recognize the structural
inequities of the carceral system as drivers of poor individual and
population health, which upstream and downstream interventions can
target. In the US, 1 2 million people (565 per 100,000 residents) are in
some way confined by the State, either through imprisonment,
probation/parole, home confinement, or pre-trial detention. 2 The Eighth
Amendment to the Constitution requires that incarcerated people receive
some minimum standard of necessary care during periods of State
confinement. 3 However, [currently and formerly incarcerated people and
their allies, as well as many healthcare providers and health experts,
frequently highlight the ways in which jails and prisons cause and
**exacerbate** physical and mental illness and disease]{.underline}.
Disease Transmission [[Prisons]{.mark} and jails [are **prime** sites
for **rapid** and **unmanageable** disease transmission both within the
walls and out]{.mark} in the communities]{.underline} that prison staff
return to when their shift ends. These [[facilities are
**overpopulated**]{.mark} and **[poorly
ventilated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} part of
the punitive process [[includes]{.mark} **extremely
[restricted]{.mark}** [and **regimented** movement]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Prisoners do not have the **autonomy** to isolate themselves]{.mark}
from others]{.underline}, [[nor]{.underline}]{.mark} do they [have
[access]{.mark} to]{.underline} personal protective equipment
([[PPE]{.underline}]{.mark}) or other preventative measures to minimize
transmission risk of infectious diseases. [Staff bring in any contagions
they may have which can then **rapidly** spread within the
facilities]{.underline}. Similarly, staff who become infected with
communicable diseases bring these diseases back to their communities.
[During the COVID-19 pandemic, prisons were a **primary site** of **mass
infection**]{.underline}, and many [advocates argued for
[depopulating]{.mark} the [prisons]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially of
those who were particularly vulnerable to COVID infection, [[as a means
of slowing]{.mark} the [spread]{.mark} of the disease]{.underline}.
Sanitation and Hygiene The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the ways
in which [[prison]{.mark} procedures [fail to provide adequate sanitary
conditions]{.mark} within their facilities]{.underline}. Prisoners often
must purchase sanitizers, cleaning supplies, soaps, body washes, and
menstrual products through the commissary. These items must be purchased
by money either earned through work --- where wages can be pennies an
hour in parts of the country --- or money donated by family and friends
in the free world. 4 This [shifting of sanitary responsibility onto
[prisoners]{.mark}]{.underline}, [of whom most [are unable to]{.mark}
[afford]{.mark} necessary products to meet minimum [sanitation]{.mark}
standards]{.underline}, [fosters an environment of poor personal hygiene
and environmental sanitation]{.underline}. Medical Care [Despite being
**constitutionally entitled** to medical care]{.underline}, [prisoners
and many [medical staff report]{.mark} inadequate or wholly [**absent**
care for **everything**]{.mark} ranging from small injuries to chronic
illnesses]{.underline}. [[Prisoners]{.mark} report misdiagnoses,
unnecessary invasive procedures, poor maternal healthcare, and
more]{.underline}. [Many [are **inhibited** from seeking care]{.mark} in
the first place]{.underline}, as they are only allowed to receive
medical treatment if a correctional officer brings them to the medical
wing. 5 [Necessary care can be delayed **indefinitely** with little
recourse as reports of medical neglect are largely
**ignored**]{.underline}. Trauma [Incarceration is a traumatic
experience]{.underline}. [Incarcerated individuals are
**caged**]{.underline}, **[dehumanized]{.underline}**,
**[violated]{.underline}**, [punished, and otherwise mistreated, and
this is justified by the societal agreement that these individuals
deserve whatever happens by virtue of being a criminal]{.underline}.
Additionally, many individuals who enter these facilities --- including
[90% of women]{.underline} --- [have experienced traumatic events prior
to interacting with the carceral system]{.underline}, [and the
conditions of their confinement prevent them from recovering and healing
while further traumatizing them]{.underline}. 6 [These effects and
others are felt long after a person is released from prison]{.underline}
as well. Though in theory a person's punishment ends when their sentence
does, the effects of the punishment often continue indefinitely. For
example, criminal records often disqualify people from employment and
housing 7 with minimal recourse. Further, [the stigma associated with
incarceration can be incredibly isolating, preventing formerly
incarcerated people from getting basic needs met]{.underline}. 8
Additionally, incarceration impacts the families and communities of
those incarcerated because of the emotional, financial, and social
challenges caused by their absence. It is estimated that 80 million
individuals in the United States have a criminal record and nearly half
of all adults in the United States have immediate family members who are
currently or formerly incarcerated. 9 [The burden of these poor health
and community outcomes is disproportionately borne by people of
color]{.underline}, [especially Black people]{.underline}. Black people
are overrepresented in prison populations due to policies that increase
police presence in predominantly Black communities, laws targeting
behaviors associated with communities of color, and discriminatory
actions taken at all levels of the legal process, from arrest to
conviction to release. 10 These practices were introduced to reinforce
white power as slavery was being abolished, [systematizing racial
disparities as **fundamental** to the operation of the modern carceral
system]{.underline}. 11 [[Black]{.mark} and brown [communities
experience high]{.mark}er [rates of]{.mark} [disease]{.mark}
prevalence]{.underline}, [especially infectious diseases]{.underline}
and those that affect the immune system, [which are [exacerbated]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} periods of [incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline}. 12 [They are
more likely to be arrested]{.underline}, [more likely to receive a
conviction]{.underline}, [and more likely to receive longer sentences
for the same crimes as their white counterparts]{.underline},
[increasing the likelihood and duration of exposure to the health
consequences of incarceration]{.underline}. 13 These compound other
disease burdens, leading to more significant detrimental effects. The
number of people incarcerated, and the length of their incarceration,
determines the scope and gravity of their exposure to these individual
and public health effects. Therefore, one way to minimize the public
health effects of incarceration is to address factors that increase the
likelihood of incarceration and lengthy sentences. In this paper, I
argue that [[plea bargains are a **driver** of incarceration and
its]{.mark} subsequent [health effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. I propose
several pathways through which to eliminate or severely restrict the
practice of plea bargaining to minimize the health effects associated
with incarceration. Each intervention would be implemented through
different government channels and may affect some or all individuals
charged with a crime. I determine effectiveness by considering how broad
the reduction in the practices is as well as how many people are likely
to experience shorter or no periods of incarceration. I determine
feasibility through resources, capacity, and political will. Plea
Bargaining and Its Relationship to Incarceration Length

#### Plea bargaining encourages targeting poor income and black folk to meet quotas, causing the criminalization of blackness

**Canon 23** \[Dan Canon, civil rights lawyer and a law professor at the
University of Louisville in Kentucky, 1-29-2023, \"Plea Bargains Are a
Tool of Racist Mass Incarceration\", Truthout,
https://truthout.org/articles/plea-bargains-are-a-tool-of-racist-mass-incarceration/\]/Kankee

Shameka Parrish-Wright, a bail reform activist and the director of
VOCAL-KY, an organization that provides support to low-income people in
the criminal legal system, explained: "While doing bail reform work ...
I ran into so many people right before they were about to decide on
taking a plea deal.... I remember working with public defenders and
other defense attorneys to pay bails and get people out before accepting
terrible plea deals. Plea deals build prisons and keep people
incarcerated. Plea deals also feed the probation and parole system,
which needs a complete overhaul." But [why should plea bargaining lead
to racist outcomes]{.underline}? This answer requires a little more
parsing. [Because of the prevalence of plea bargaining, [police
know]{.mark} that virtually [any arrest]{.mark} they make will [end in
a]{.mark} conviction]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} alone [can lead to
racially unequal outcomes if you've got a racist cop who is only
interested in arresting people of color]{.underline}.
[Since]{.underline} nearly **[every]{.underline}** [arrest is justified
by its inevitable conclusion]{.underline}, i.e. [a [plea
bargain]{.mark}]{.underline} and conviction, [[an officer's
motives]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[never]{.mark}**
meaningfully [questioned]{.mark} in court]{.underline} or anywhere else.
The problem is more complicated than that, though. [[Because]{.mark}
their [performance is]{.mark} often [measured in number]{.mark} of
arrests, [there is **little incentive**]{.mark} for any officer [to
exercise]{.mark} much on-the-job [caution]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If a
cop is told to arrest as many people as possible every day]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} will likely start [look]{.underline}ing [in the
poorest part of town]{.underline}. That's not to say that poor people
commit more crime than their suburban counterparts --- they don't. But
[the [arrestees]{.mark} harvested [from]{.mark} the [poor]{.mark}est
[communities are]{.mark} the **[easiest prey]{.mark}** for officers who
need to meet quotas]{.underline} because once they are sucked into the
system, [they]{.underline} often [must plead guilty to something or face
even worse consequences than the conviction itself]{.underline}. Think
of it this way[: [A cop]{.mark} [would]{.mark} more likely [arrest
someone]{.mark} who is [likely to take a deal]{.mark} and get convicted
quickly, [rather]{.mark} [than someone with]{.mark} the [means to post
bail]{.mark}, [**prolong** the process]{.mark} [and hire private lawyers
to put]{.mark} [the officer's behavior under a
microscope]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many of the [poorer
communities]{.underline} in the U.S., especially in urban centers, [are
populated by people of color. This is thanks in large part to
"redlining]{.underline}" [practices]{.underline} which relegated Black
people and other people of color into the places that white people
didn't want to live. "Often, [[people of color who]{.mark} reside in
under-resourced communities [do not have]{.mark} the means to hire [a
private attorney]{.mark} that will fight for a better
outcome]{.underline}," explained Melba Pearson, a former prosecutor and
civil rights attorney who specializes in policy. "Often, private
attorneys have more investigators at their disposal, will provide
broader mitigation for a judge to consider and can provide a more robust
defense than a public defender who has 2 -- 3 times the number of
cases.... [A public defender may encourage their client to plea for fear
of a harsher sentence at trial, or a lack of resources to be able to
investigate the case with a fine-tooth comb despite the possibility of
an acquittal."]{.underline} Thus, while anyone of any race can be
arrested at any time for anything (or for nothing at all), [[the
**target on your back** becomes bigger if]{.mark} you're poor, and
bigger still if [you're poor and Black]{.mark}]{.underline}. An officer
need not be a member of the Aryan Brotherhood to arrest a
disproportionate number of people of color; they need only follow a
simple order to maximize the number of arrests they make. CalvinJohn
Smiley, professor of sociology at Hunter College-City University of New
York, explained how [[plea bargaining racializes crime]{.mark} in plain
sight, immediately affecting incarcerated youth. "The expectation is
that many of these young men who are racialized as Black and Latinx will
eventually succumb to a plea agreement]{.underline}, which typically
occurs after spending a year, if not more, within the juvenile facility.
During that time, they are exposed to various forms of violence and
if/when they turn 18 and 'catch a case' in the facility, often, will be
transferred to \[an adult jail\], which in turn places them at higher
risk for exposure to violence." Here's where the serpent swallows its
tail: [[After generations of unequal]{.mark} arrests of Black people for
everything under the sun, with most of those arrests ending in
[**quick** **convictions**]{.mark}, many of the [players]{.mark} in the
criminal legal system --- including cops, judges, prosecutors and even
defense attorneys --- have come to [equate]{.mark} "[Blackness" with
"criminality]{.mark}]{.underline}." Legal scholar Carlos Berdejó
described the practice of "using a defendant's race \[an observable
attribute\] as a proxy for the defendant's inherent criminality \[an
unobservable attribute\]." In other words, the law has gotten so used to
rapidly affixing the label of "criminal" to Black people that it assumes
the Venn diagram between "Black" and "criminal" is a perfect circle.
There's no easy way to disrupt this process, but I believe it can be
disrupted. The first step is to recognize the mechanism that enables the
harm. For decades, the U.S. has been without a serious dialogue about
basing an entire criminal legal system on backroom "deals" that are sure
to end in convictions. It's time we started one.

### Contention 5: Racism (Critical)

#### Plea bargaining is a racial hermeneutics of the self to construct racialized subjects who legally admit to the guilt of their non-humanity

"The deck was stacked against me" In November 1990, Michael
[Phillips]{.underline}, a 32-year-old African American man, [pled guilty
to]{.underline} the [rape]{.underline} of a 16-year-old white girl at a
motel in Dallas, Texas. [Without investigating the charges, the public
defender advised Phillips that if he took his case to
trial]{.underline}, [he would]{.underline} likely [receive a life
sentence]{.underline} because "[no jury would believe a Black man over a
white girl]{.underline}."1 Unwilling to risk this outcome, Phillips took
a plea bargain that reduced his sen- tence to twelve-years in prison. He
later expressed the futility of insisting upon his inno- cence in the
face of state institutions and actors convinced of his guilt: "In 1990,
it felt like slavery was still going strong for me ... The deck was
stacked against me from Jump Street ... "2 It was not until 2014,
twenty-four years after his conviction, that the Convic- tion Integrity
Unit in Dallas matched DNA evidence to a different person and rec-
ommended that Phillips be exonerated. The circumstances of Phillips's
case and the sentiment he expresses about it illustrate the astonishing
failure of American jurisprudence to bring about an outcome resembling
justice. Although we might evaluate this failure on any number of
levels, I want to inquire into what emerges if we take seriously the
council of the lawyer that Phillips should plead guilty because "no jury
would believe a Black man over a white girl" and Phillips's own
recognition that "the deck was stacked against me." These comments
exemplify what is the case for the large numbers of Black criminal
defendants who give up their right to a jury trial in exchange for a
lesser charge or sentence. Moreover, they shed light on the performative
capacity of legal confessions. As I will argue, [[Phillips's guilty
plea]{.mark} did more than convict him of a crime]{.underline}. [It
[constructed a racialized criminal subject]{.mark} [whose]{.mark} very
[essence was his criminality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, legal
confessions throughout the criminal justice system -- from those
occurring in police interrogations, sentencing hearings, and parole
board reviews -- bring about a similar effect. In this essay, I focus on
the most ubiquitous instance of legal confession in the American
criminal justice system: the plea bargain. I criticize [the American
practice of plea bargaining by showing its per- formative capacity to
construct a racialized criminal subject [lacking full human
status]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, rather than be rid of legal forms
of confession, I seek to mobilize its performative force by showing how
confession of wrongdoing can, when situated in the context of an
apophatic anthropology, clear the way for a new kind of human being. In
order to make these claims, I first examine how it became possible that
a [[legal admission]{.mark} of wrongdoing came to [delimit]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}n entire [subject]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requires
understanding the role of Christian practices of confession in the
emergence of the modern legal subject. Drawing on ancient and medieval
Christian thinkers as well as upon the French philo- sopher Michel
Foucault, I trace these movements to [[figure]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [American [plea bargain as a
**secularized**]{.mark}]{.underline} form of [**[confession of
sins]{.mark}** [concerned]{.mark} not simply with determining who has
committed an illegal deed but [with discovering a criminal with an
essential relation to his crime]{.mark}.]{.underline} Any consideration
of the performativity of plea bargaining must reckon with the racialized
character of criminal justice in the United States and the near
universal use of the plea bargain as a mechanism for adjudicating
criminal cases. As is well known, [[criminal]{.mark} cases in the United
States involve people of color to a degree disproportionate to their
population share]{.underline}. 3 Studies further suggest that [a
defendant's racial minority status restricts the favorability of the
plea deal]{.underline} that the defense attorney can secure for her
client. 4 [These [realities]{.mark} [contribute to]{.mark} the
furthering of [symbolic connections between Blackness and guilt,
whiteness and innocence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sociologist Nicole
Gonzalez Van Cleve details how [this [racialization]{.mark} [carries
with it]{.mark} the rhetorical and [legal **dehuma- nization**]{.mark}
of defendants]{.underline}. 5 [The "mope" names low-level criminal
defendants as immoral, unintelligent, and]{.underline} thus [unworthy of
receiving dignifying treatment and due process]{.underline}. As Van
Cleve shows, [while the figure of the mope is colorblind]{.underline} on
its face, [it]{.underline} nonetheless [codes a Black criminal whose
guilt can be assumed]{.underline}. [For white defendants, inclusion in
the category of the mope entails a betrayal of their whiteness, which is
to say, their innocence.]{.underline} The performance of the plea
bargain is central to the construction and dehumanization of the mope. I
argue, therefore, that the [[plea bargain is a]{.mark} crucial
mechanism]{.underline} [in]{.underline} what Alexander Weheliye calls
"**[[racializing assemblages]{.underline}]{.mark}**," or the process [by
which human [beings are sorted into]{.mark} the categories [of fully
human, not-quite-human, or non-human]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Christian
theologies and practices of confession have been foundational for the
for- mation and confinement of racialized criminal subjects, then
Christian theology's current task ought to be self-critical. That is, it
ought to dispossess itself of its anthropological commitments and of the
practices of confession that construct them in order to clear the way
for new possibilities for thinking the subject and the legal system's
dealings with them. In the third section, I seek to develop an apophatic
anthropology stemming from Judith Butler's recognition of the
performative power of confessions and from the Christian apophatic
tradition. Apophatic, or negative, theology insists upon the final
negation of every creaturely attempt to name God. This need not mean
that one cannot say anything about the divine, but that in speaking of
God, one must be cognizant of the ultimate failure of human language to
refer to the divine. I seek to extend this nega- tive theological
impulse to the realm of the creature, arguing for an apophatic
anthropol- ogy and an apophatic confession that negates claims to a
human being's essence. By showing the resonance of this tradition with
critical race theory's epistemological frame- works, especially
anti-essentialism, I trace the implications of an apophatic confession
for the plea bargain. Finally, I ask how the kind of
subject-construction that occurs in the plea bargain might be done away
with and how a new role for confession in the American criminal justice
system might be imagined. Scholars and organizers have shown that
confession within the context of transformative justice has a role to
play in the reparation of wrongs. It presents the oppor- tunity for
reckoning with the wrongs one has committed, making reparation for them,
and becoming a different kind of person in relation to those one has
harmed. I suggest that this kind of transformative approach to
confession resonates with my vision of apophatic confes- sion and is
thus precisely what is needed in American uses of legal confession.
Moreover, because the issue as I articulate it here is not simply about
those who have broken the law but about the broader systems of power in
which one breaks the law and is categorized as a criminal, I gesture
toward the need for religious, communal rituals of confession that
engage communities in performatively dispossessing themselves of
prevailing anthropologi- cal assumptions and ways of being. By
developing rituals of confession that seek to rid them- selves of
self-possession in favor of relational notions of human being, a new
vision of the human might be imagined. Condemning someone you do not
know: Foucauldian avowal and criminal subjectivity My first task in this
essay is to show that a major site of legal confession in American
criminal justice, the plea bargain, needs to be understood as a
secularized form of the Christian practice of confession of sins.
[Foucault]{.underline}'s genealogical work on avowal 6 in his lectures
Wrong-Doing, Truth-Telling aids this task, first, because he [provides
an account of the "contamination" between religious and judicial
practices of confession,]{.underline} and second, because [he makes
clear [the]{.mark} contemporary criminal [justice system's]{.mark}
funda- mental [need for a confession from the
accused]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 The transformation in the application and
function of avowal that [Foucault]{.underline} [examines]{.underline}
corresponds to shifting notions of the "discovery and formulation of the
truth" of oneself, a process he calls [the "hermeneutics of the
self."]{.underline}8 Foucault traces the shift in hermeneutical
approaches from a Christian interpretation of an individual's thoughts,
intentions, and desires to a modern hermeneu- tics [informed by
psychiatry and criminology]{.underline} and [concerned with interpreting
a subject who embodies on a deep individual level the acts he
commits]{.underline}. 9 According to Foucault, a Christian hermeneutics
of the self was operative in Christian forms of penance from antiquity
to the middle ages.10 The second-century theologian Tertullian
exemplified what Foucault calls exomologesis, a non-verbal
"publish\[ing\]" of oneself through external acts. Tertullian allowed
Christians only one post-baptismal repentance, the content of which was
primarily external displays of sorrow: lying in sack and ashes, fasting,
weeping, and lying prostrate before priests and the godly. For
Tertullian, such humiliating acts perform an outward "demeanor
calculated to move \[God's\] mercy."11

#### Plea bargains are racial degradation ceremonies that preemptively assumes - but simultaneously reifies and constructs - essences of black criminality that is inscribed onto the racialized and criminalized subject. Confirmations of blackness' criminal ontology are from the seemingly colorblind process that discovers the essence of blackness via confession. Arguments of efficiency are false pretenses to hide how the guilty verdict predetermined the assumptions guilt by virtue of blackness, making due process redundant

\[Badinter\] turned toward the jurors and said to them: "But in the end,
the accused, of course, he acknowledged his crime. He confessed. But
what did he tell you about this crime? What information did he give you
about his crime, about the reasons for his crime, about who he is? You
have no idea ... He did not say anything. He did not want to say
anything. He could not say anything. In any case, you, you know nothing
about him" ... he closed with this sen- tence: "In the end, can you
condemn to death someone whom you do not know?"30 In this case, the
first avowal, which established the guilt of the defendant for a
particular crime, is not in question. It is the second avowal, the
essentialization of the criminal subject, that is at stake. By asking
the jurors whether they actually know who Henry is, Badinter questions
whether a single confession can perform both tasks. It further shows the
legal necessity for a confession to speak to one's identity, since as
Badinter implies, only saying what one has done leaves the legal process
unfulfilled. This anecdote provides insight into Michael Phillips's case
as well. While Henry failed to provide a satisfactory double confession,
[Phillips's false confession]{.underline} met both requirements: he both
[admitted his guilt and confirmed his criminal identity]{.underline}.
[His lawyer's advice to take [the]{.mark} plea deal because a jury is
unlikely to "believe a Black man over a white girl]{.underline}"
[suggests that [court]{.mark} actors, possibly even the lawyer himself,
had [already determined who Phillips]{.mark} [was]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[His confession **confirmed their suspicions**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline}, as I will show in later sections, [[made him
into]{.mark} the very criminal they thought him to be.]{.underline} The
narrative I have told here is necessarily incomplete. For one thing, it
focuses entirely on developments in Europe and not in England, where
much of American crim- inal law derives. However, what this Foucauldian
genealogy illustrates is the extent to which [Christian confessional
practices are implicated in]{.underline} the development of [[a
confessing legal subject whose **self-implication** speaks]{.mark} not
only of one's actions at a given time and place but also, and more
importantly, [of one's **essence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This brief
Foucauldian genealogy points out the fundamental need of criminal
justice systems to identify a criminal subject as the object of
punishment. What remains to be seen, however, is the way that the con-
temporary American criminal justice system constructs racialized
criminal subjects who are, as Sylvia Wynter puts it, "not-quite-human,"
and for this reason, in need of punishment. 31 31 "Racializing
assemblages," "mopes," and the "criminalblackman" "Racializing
assemblages," theorist Alexander Weheliye's term for thinking race "not
as a biological or cultural classification but as a set of
sociopolitical processes that discipline humanity into full humans,
not-quite-humans, and nonhumans," illuminates the con- nections between
race and the modern self-possessed human subject that is at the heart of
legal confessional practice. 32 For Weheliye, drawing on Wynter,
whiteness is never simply a marker of a biological given but a set of
power relations that establishes who can claim full human status.
Blackness, Weheliye says, operates as a limit concept that provides the
contrast needed for whites to define themselves as fully human.33 As
Wynter makes clear, this particular iteration of humanity, which she
calls "Man," entails, in part, a decision about the rational capacities
of certain groups of homo Sapiens. "Man" figures indigenous Americans
and enslaved Africans as "irrational," "sub-rational," or "savage" and
consequently, as failing to attain to full human status.34 The emergence
of race as a standard for what it means to be human is inseparable from
moral and spiritual orders. Indeed, numerous scholars have noted the
connections between the perception of Native Americans and enslaved
Africans as less than fully human and the tendency to think of these
groups as immoral and outside of Christian community. 35 As theologian
Marika Rose shows, the modern senses of race and racism emerged within
the Christian symbolic register of the purity of blood. Rose writes,
"Those racialized others now ontologically outside the sphere of
Christianity continued to be guilty, complicit, and vulnerable to the
violent judgement of God; those within the sphere of Christianity and of
whiteness were innocent, safe, and able to enact God's jud- gement upon
others in the name of their salvation."36 The religious and moral
symbolism attached to racial markers justified the rise of a racial
capitalism that contributed to the further dehumanization of racial
others. The sociologist Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve describes how [this
moral order operates in a colorblind]{.underline} [manner]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}side [Chicago's]{.underline} Cook County
[Courthouse]{.underline}. [The "mope" names a person who offends
a]{.underline} particular [moral code]{.underline} held among the
professionals in the court- room. [Mopes are perceived to be
disrespectful, lazy, and incompetent]{.underline}, and [their alleged
crimes]{.underline} -- usually low-level infractions like drug-dealing,
theft, or other nonviolent felo- nies -- [solidify this
perception]{.underline}. While the label makes no explicit reference to
race, it [carries racial undertones, correlating the ethical failures of
the mope with his lifestyle and capacity for humanity]{.underline}. Van
Cleve repeatedly tells of court [officials]{.underline}
[mock]{.underline}ing [defen- dants in Ebonics and commenting on their
childlike capacity for reason]{.underline}.37 [[Without men- tioning
race, criminal court proceedings presume the guilt of Black defendants
and treat these defendants as if they were guilty]{.underline}]{.mark}
[not only of a particular crime but]{.underline} [[in their]{.mark} very
[person]{.mark}]{.underline}. Precisely because "mope" is a colorblind
category, phenotypically white defen- dants who act like mopes are
included in the category as well. Such behavior amounts to a betrayal of
their whiteness and their innocence and an inclusion into the categories
of Black and guilty. [The supposedly colorblind figure of the mope
enables us to see, then, how legal proceedings operate according to
racialized figurations of criminals]{.underline}. Speaking of the
criminalization of African Americans in particular, critical race
theorist Katheryn Russell-Brown names this racialized figure the "myth
of the criminalblackman."38 We might ask what role plea bargains play in
the perpetuation of these myths, since Van Cleve and Russell-Brown imply
that the racism at work in these categories seems to be operative prior
to the entry of a guilty plea. I suggest that [[plea bargains are the
**primary**]{.mark} legal]{.underline} [[means]{.mark} by [which Black
men are drawn into]{.mark} the [racializing assemblages that delineate
who counts as fully human]{.mark} and who does not]{.underline}. While
on its face, the plea deal is a confession of a particular crime, when
it is undertaken within the context of the criminalization of Blackness,
it performs a double confession similar to the one Foucault described.
[[The confession functions]{.mark} [as]{.mark} both an admission of
guilt con- cerning an illegal act and [a **self-affirmation** of one's
identity as a]{.mark} mope or a [criminalblack-
man]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[the confession]{.mark} of a
crime in the form of a plea bargain performs the [construct]{.mark}ion
of [the not-quite-human]{.mark} in accordance with the categories of the
mope and the criminalblackman]{.underline}.39 [Van Cleve]{.underline}'s
observations are particularly vivid here. She [describes [the]{.mark}
"ceremonial charade" of due process for mopes as "**[racial degradation
ceremonies]{.mark}**]{.underline}."40 In these rituals, [the mope is
dehumanized rhetorically in the sense that he is often disrespected,
insulted, and degraded by court officials]{.underline}. The mope is also
dehumanized in the legal sense. [[He is]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[**[short-changed]{.underline}** [of the right to **due
process**]{.underline}]{.mark} that is granted to all legal persons.
[[Under the guise of]{.mark} courtroom [efficiency]{.mark}, mopes are
funneled through the court- room as quickly as possible without concern
for due process or]{.underline} the [details]{.underline} of their
cases. This behavior is justified by court officials because [the mope
figures one without full pos- session of himself]{.underline}. [[Due
process]{.underline}]{.mark}, one prosecutor told Van Cleve, [[is
a]{.mark} "[waste" because defendants are mentally incapable of
understanding their rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. 41 This ritual charade
provides a clearer sense of the dehumanizing performativity of the plea
bargain and sheds light on the transformative process undergone by
Michael Phillips and those like him. First, the current model of
[criminal justice remains tethered to]{.underline} the modern notion of
the self that came about through [Christian]{.underline} practices of
[confession]{.underline}. According to this model, [we need not concern
ourselves with whether Phillip's guilty plea was true]{.underline}
according to an external standard of evidence, [since we
have]{.underline} the truest form of evidence that there is:
[self-incrimination]{.underline}. [This is the "steep price" of
personhood that Weheliye names: the modern notion of the
self]{.underline}, purportedly ascribed to every human being regardless
of race, [operates within a system of [racialization]{.mark} that
[weaponizes one's self-possession in order to revoke
the]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[humanity one is said to
possess]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 . Second, given the criminalization of
Blackness and the legal system in which it oper- ates, confessions in
the form of plea bargains bolster the racialized system of control. [By
pleading guilty, Phillips identified himself according to the category
of the criminalblack- man that had already been constructed for
him]{.underline}. A Black man entering into [a plea bargain affirms the
very myth of criminality that placed him in his current
situation]{.underline}. In saying this, I do not blame the person who
pleads guilty. [[The]{.mark} criminal [justice
system]{.mark}]{.underline} has **[[greased the
skids]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so to speak, **[[to
operate]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
**[[economically]{.underline}]{.mark}** as possible [[while
affirming]{.mark} pre- cisely [what it **already assumes to be
true**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead, what I hope to name here is the
legal need for the (voluntary or coerced) participation of the defendant
in their own performa- tive construction as a racialized criminal
subject. Finally, [[a confession]{.underline}]{.mark} by the [accused
allows for the criminal justice system to [maintain the **veneer** of
**colorblind neutrality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Once Phillips entered
his plea, [[no charge of racism could be brought]{.mark} against the
system [since the accused himself has confirmed his
guilt]{.mark}]{.underline}. But, set in the wider context of the figures
of the mope and the criminalblackman, [the plea bargain becomes visible
as a crucial component of a racialized system that affirms the
connections between Blackness, criminality, and the
not-quite-human]{.underline}. Up to this point in the essay, we have
seen that the function of confession of sins as it has moved from an
ecclesial context to a judicial one has been to construct a particularly
modern subject who is autonomous, rational and thereby capable of giving
an account of one's identity. Through the work of legal scholars and
Black theorists, we have seen that this identity construction has an
irreducibly racial character. What I will show in the remainder of the
essay is that the demand to confess not only what one has done but one's
true identity is impossible to satisfy. Apophatic anthropology: the
impossibility of giving an account of oneself

#### Identity construction leads to the internalized self-belonging of the once-external constructions that implicate our own sense of self. Our sense as subjects is defined by the external criminal identity construction, which we then internalize as self-possession, making us permanently racialized, criminal subjects via the legalized, yet coerced confession of our essence.

Finally, a confession by the accused allows for the criminal justice
system to maintain the veneer of colorblind neutrality. Once Phillips
entered his plea, no charge of racism could be brought against the
system since the accused himself has confirmed his guilt. But, set in
the wider context of the figures of the mope and the criminalblackman,
the plea bargain becomes visible as a crucial component of a racialized
system that affirms the connections between Blackness, criminality, and
the not-quite-human. Up to this point in the essay, we have seen that
the function of confession of sins as it has moved from an ecclesial
context to a judicial one has been to construct a particularly modern
subject who is autonomous, rational and thereby capable of giving an
account of one's identity. Through the work of legal scholars and Black
theorists, we have seen that [[this identity construction has an]{.mark}
irreducibly [racial character]{.mark}]{.underline}. What I will show in
the remainder of the essay is that [the demand to confess not only what
one has done but one's true identity is impossible to
satisfy]{.underline}. Apophatic anthropology: the impossibility of
giving an account of oneself The defendant's involvement in the
construction of his own criminalized subjectivity through the practice
of confession resonates with Judith Butler's theory of performativity.
Butler takes up the performative character of confession in her work
Giving an Account of Oneself, claiming that every account of the self
"enact\[s\] the very self I am trying to describe."43 As we have seen,
this performance of [[confession]{.underline}]{.mark} does heavy lifting
in the criminal justice system, effectively
[[construct]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the not-quite human subject that
it sub- sequently dehumanizes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet, in Giving an
Account of Oneself, Butler provides philosophi- cal grounds for thinking
about the human in terms other than self-possession. Her relational
anthropology provides the basis for an apophatic anthropology that, I
suggest, ought to be brought to bear on the practice of plea bargaining.
What makes [Butler]{.underline} a useful interlocutor in my exploration
of plea bargaining is her [positing]{.underline} "of [a subject who is
**not self-grounding**]{.underline}."44 She insists that [[a]{.mark}
fundamental [exposure to an other is constitutive of]{.mark} and thus
prior to [a]{.mark}ny subsisting [self]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
subject can never be said to possess oneself since she is composed
fundamentally of relations to an other]{.underline}]{.mark}. The notion
that the self is grounded not in itself but in a prior rela- tionality
means that [[one]{.underline}]{.mark} can never give an account of
oneself -- [[can never say who one is -- without]{.mark} simultaneously
[depriving that account of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.mark}
self-sufficiency and [self-possession]{.mark}]{.underline} that purports
to be at its core. 45 This is the case, Butler says, [because
the]{.underline} very [norms one uses to account for oneself precede the
time of one's accounting]{.underline}. The linguistic and cognitive
structures that make one intelligible as a self cannot be confined to
the self one is. The moment I try to speak about myself in a way that
distinguishes me from all others, I resort to a language that precedes
me. Moreover, from infancy one finds oneself confronted by another who
precedes one and without whom one would not exist. [In Butler's view,
there is no prior subject who has access to the truest sense of the
self]{.underline}. There is instead "an array of [relations and
processes]{.underline}" which [are "implicated in]{.underline} the world
of [primary caregivers in ways that con- stitute \[the self's\] very
definition]{.underline}."46 [These observations]{.underline}, Butler
claims, [give the lie to any notion of a self-constituting and
self-possessed subject]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} primary
relations open into a wider relationality that further
**[preclude]{.underline}**s [one's ability to account for
oneself]{.underline}. According to Butler, [every attempt to account for
oneself takes place in the "structure of address]{.underline}."47 [The
account one gives of oneself is necessarily addressed to a you, an
other, who receives -- and subsequently interrupts -- that
account]{.underline}.48 [Giving an account of oneself in an attempt to
establish the self as an object of self-possession gives way to a
dispossessive "unknowing about who \[the self\] is]{.underline}." [[The
other before whom I give my]{.mark} [account]{.mark}]{.underline}, who
constitutes me fundamentally and who is herself a mystery to me,
[[ensures that I am a mystery to myself]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though
Butler does not use the language of Christian apophasis, we see in her
relational anthropology the potential for an apophatic anthropology with
resources for negating the self-possessed subject. Theologian Catherine
Keller folds Butler's relational anthropology into her apophatic cloud,
unfolding a theological ethics based on the undoing of the self. Drawing
lines of connection between Butler, Whitehead, and process thought,
Keller explores the reson- ance of Butler's opaque self with a broader
"apophatic entanglement."49 Confronted with one's embeddedness in
language, one's dependance upon primary relations, and one's constant
relations with the other, one discovers an apophatic core that
simultaneously confounds one's ability to speak about oneself and
concerns one with every other (human and nonhuman). [The undoing of the
modern self gives way, Keller says, to a knowing unknowingness of
oneself and the other and marks the possibility of being, acting, and
knowing otherwise]{.underline}. [The "agent-I is already an intra-active
we]{.underline}," Keller says, and precisely for this reason one is
responsible for and account-able to the other. 50 Butler and Keller
articulate with philosophical and theological rigor the failure of the
self-possessed "I" to take full possession of itself. [The self is
implicated in a web of relations that make it impossible to determine
what part of "me" is separate from "you" and from the array of systems
and influences that shape "us.]{.underline}" From a legal stand- point
Butler and Keller lead us to reconsider what exactly is being asked of
the one who pleads guilty. The law presumes the accused is a
self-subsisting "I" who is both the agent of particular acts and who has
at his fingertips a history and a language that can be used to manifest
the truth of the self. Butler and Keller suggest to us that this is
precisely what one lacks. Thus, an apophatic anthropology that takes its
cues from them recognizes that the accused is incapable of meeting the
law's expectations. Critical race theory provides a framework that,
though not deriving from Butler's rela- tional anthropology or Keller's
process theology, is surprisingly resonant with them and gives insight
into the ways law might take up an apophatic anthropology. Critical race
theory's epistemological lenses -- intersectionality and
anti-essentialism -- address the law's failure to recognize that one's
identity cannot be reduced to a single characteristic such as race, sex,
gender, class, or sexual orientation. By neglecting to recognize the
always multiple characteristics that make up a particular person, [[the
law essentializes]{.mark} legal [subjects]{.mark} in ways that do
injustice to their experiences of discrimination]{.underline}.51 In
order to counteract this tendency, certain critical race theorists have
emphasized the infinite number of factors that go into shaping one's
always fluid legal identity. For instance, Elvia R. Arriola's
intersectional model insists that "identity represents the confluence of
an infinite number of factors," which are perpetually in flux. 52 [It is
impossible]{.underline}, therefore, [to speak in any meaningful sense of
"identity" because "who I am" is constantly shifting in relation to my
experiences]{.underline}. That is, I am always changing in relation to
the human and nonhuman worlds in which I exist and to which I respond.
Angela Harris captures this unnameability of the self in her essay on
anti-essentialism. She writes, [[We are not born with a self but]{.mark}
rather are composed of a welter of partial, sometimes contra- dictory,
or even antithetical selves]{.underline}. A unified
[[identity]{.underline}]{.mark}, if such can ever exist, is a product of
will, not a common destiny or natural birthright. Thus, consciousness is
"never fixed, never attained once and for all"; it [[is not a
final]{.mark} outcome or a [biological given but]{.mark} a process, a
con- stant contradictory [state of becoming]{.mark}, [in which]{.mark}
both [social institutions]{.mark} and individual wills [are deeply
implicated]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 Though neither Arriola nor Harris
write in the register of relationality, they gesture, instead, toward
the notion of a self in process whose status as a particular kind of
self remains always illusive and ever mysterious, both to the law and to
oneself. This illusive- ness is central to what I mean by an apophatic
anthropology. [[Any attempt to name the self must always be accompanied
by a negation of that name]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Confession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I am suggesting,
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** precisely this
**[[unnaming]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If we take seriously the
contributions provided by Butler, Keller, and critical race the- orists
in the development of an apophatic anthropology, we may see the
contradiction at work in plea bargaining. Though plea bargaining
requires a modern subject who perfor- matively constructs his own
racialized criminal subjectivity, from an apophatic anthro- pological
perspective, a confession of this kind may undo that same subject. A
confession by a self whose "constant contradictory state of becoming" is
shaped in infinite relation to others -- including in relation to the
racializing assemblages that form communities, systems, and institutions
in the United States -- will performatively dispossess and unsay the
confessing subject and his given essential identity. I will spell out in
the next section the implications of this apophatic anthropology for the
practice of legal confession. However, it may be instructive here to
note that an apo- phatic anthropology does away with the need to create
an essential criminal identity. [[Plea bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}
as it has come to function [[would have to be done away with since
naming a criminal identity is precisely its goal]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This would have had massive implications for Michael Phillips, since it
would challenge both the pressure to plead guilty without trial and,
more fundamentally, the very category of the criminalblackman into which
Phillips's lawyer (and, assuming his lawyer was correct, the potential
jury) had placed him. An apophatic anthropology envisions a culture and
a legal system in which the legal reality that "no jury would believe a
Black man over a white girl" is unimaginable. Apophatic confessions

#### Coerced voluntariness allows the state to construct the now self-inscribed criminal identity, ex post facto "proving the truth" of their initial charges of a criminal personality via confession

E. Manufacturingof Consent In the vast majority of cases, the conditions
of [[a plea bargain]{.mark} require defendants to confess and waive
their right to appeal]{.underline}.2 4 ° [This both [legitimizes and
totalizes the state\'s penal authority]{.mark}. [The confession serves
as a]{.mark} **badge of truth**, \"[definitive\" proof]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark} [state\'s accusations were correct]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} [waiver proscribes the possibility of a contradictory
conclusion in the future]{.underline},2 41 which is [reminiscent of
Foucault\'s]{.underline} concept of [[docile
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 42 [Defendants [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
not just subjected to the will of prosecutors; they are [[expected to
assist in their own]{.mark} [incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\"[[Consent\" is used as a shield against
criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Once the victim agrees to be the
object of violence, perpetrators can justify their actions by arguing
that if they acted unjustly, the victim would not have
acquiesced]{.mark}.]{.underline} Plea-bargaining\'s reliance on the
manufacturing of consent is exemplified by the Supreme Court\'s position
that the constitutionality of a plea-bargaining should be judged on the
basis of voluntariness.24 3 As discussed previously, [the
Court]{.underline} in United States v. Ruiz [reasoned]{.underline} that
[although plea bargains are required to be voluntary, they do not
necessarily have to be fair.]{.underline}24 4 This argument is facially
irrational-[how can something be voluntary when elicited through
deceptive or unfair means]{.underline}?2 45 [[The]{.mark} clever
[twisting of]{.mark} the meaning of \"[voluntariness]{.mark}\" is not
without purpose; it [allows the state to justify]{.mark} the
[violence]{.mark} of incarceration [even]{.mark} in cases [where the
defendant]{.mark} is [innocent]{.mark}]{.underline}. 246 247 Analysis
proffered in Bordenkircherv. Hayes offers support for this proposition.
In Bordenkircher, [[the Court dismissed the possibility that an innocent
defendant may be coerced into a plea]{.mark}, reasoning that people are
\"unlikely to be driven to false self-condemnation]{.underline}., 248
What is the basis for this conclusion? [The court, in a text- book
example of circular reasoning, says, \"the basic legitimacy of plea
bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty
plea is involuntary]{.underline}. \'249 Put another way, [the Court
posits that plea-bargaining is constitutional because it is voluntary,
and it is voluntary because it would otherwise be
unconstitutional]{.underline}. 25 ° [The language of voluntariness makes
the plea bargain regime difficult to]{.underline} persuasively
[criticize because it further contributes to the misconception that
innocent people do not plead guilty]{.underline}.251 Moreover, the
Court\'s understanding of how defendants make plea bargain deci- sions
is directly contradictory with mainstream economics-the very tool used
to justify its existence.2 52 Most [economic theorist]{.underline} take
as an assumption that people are, more or less, rational actors. 253
According to this principle, [defendants should make their determination
whether or not to accept a plea based on the overall utility of the
decision, regardless of their innocence]{.underline}. 254 Utility, in
the plea context, is determined by weighing the risk and probability of
an adverse finding at trial against the certainty of terms articulated
in the plea offer.255 [Given the vast structural disadvantages against
defendants, coupled with the large penalty disparity between plea and
trial sentencing, rational actor theory dictates that many innocent
defendants will plead guilty]{.underline}.2 56 Disturbingly, there is
strong evidence indicating that this is not uncom- mon. 2 5 7 One study
found that [nearly half of people would plead guilty to a crime they did
not commit to avoid risking the massively disproportionate consequences
of going to trial]{.underline}.258 Particularly troubling, [if rational
actor theory is correct, then racism in the justice system, actual or
perceived, will increase minority defendants\' willing- ness to accept
less favorable plea deals]{.underline}.259 Disturbingly, when
controlling for non- racial factors, this appears to be the case.260
111. CONCLUSION The plea bargain regime fuels the epidemic of mass
incarceration through four processes of sanitization: (a) the
misapplication of economic and utilitarian prin- ciples; (b)
overemphasis on the minimization of physical pain and unpleasantness;
(c) obfuscation of the act, pushing its view to society\'s periphery;
and (d) the manufac- turing of consent. Similar to the virtual war in
Star Trek\'s \"A Taste of Armageddon,\" [plea-bargaining creates the
**illusion of civility** while in reality acting as a source of
**incalculable** human **suffering**]{.underline}. [The American plea
bargain regime is an **affront** to human decency and traditional
notions of fairness and justice]{.underline}. [Incarceration is a
violent act and should be treated accordingly-reserved as a measure of
**last resort**]{.underline}, accompanied by significant substantive and
procedural safeguards. Accordingly, this article calls for a critical
re-examination of plea-bargaining and the search for possible
alternatives. 261

#### Criminalization constructs blackness as morally and socially polluted, justifying the state's retributive punishment for their sinfulness, which in a viscous cycle, reconstructs their criminal ontology

American [mass incarceration has been driven by]{.underline} many
ideological factors, including the pernicious influence of theological
conceptions of "[penal substitutionary]{.underline}
[atonement]{.underline}." [Racial]{.underline} and [religious ideologies
have made America the **most-imprisoned** nation in the
world]{.underline}, and have made our prisons unusually punitive, driven
by cultural emphases on retribution. In this essay, I will consider the
mutually-reinforcing ways in which [atone- ment theology]{.underline}
has [acted in the service of racialized narratives of punishment and
control]{.underline} -- and explore the question: is it possible to
construct a liberatory theology of sub- stitutionary atonement with the
potential to undermine the retributive basis of mass incarceration, and
of imprisonment in general? I will propose a framework for reading
"substitutionary atonement" as an instance of divine intervention in
human relationships of violence: as a way of recognizing the valid debt
owed to victims of harm while rejecting the violence inherent in forms
of retribu- tive/punitive justice that turn that debt back on the
perpetrator of harm; and as a dem- onstration of "doubled divine
solidarity" -- solidarity with both the victims of harm and oppression
and those who have harmed them -- in a way that respects the real
differences of power and culpability between them. This is an
understanding of atonement not as a transactional divine-human
interaction, but as divine reconciling action in response to human
violence and oppression. As such it requires a human response: such
doubled divine solidarity requires of us human solidarity with those who
have been harmed and oppressed; solidarity which rejects retribution and
punishment, while insisting on real reparations for harm and
participation in transformative actions against oppression. This praxis
is the result and reality of such an abolitionist vision of atonement,
and is our participation in the divine atoning action which exposes the
violence of retribution but does not deny the real debt in cases of
harm, violence, and oppression. Satisfaction, punishment, and racial
control Discussion of substitutionary/ "satisfaction" language in
atonement theology usually begins with medieval theologian Anselm of
Canterbury and Protestant reformer John Calvin. Where Anselm's theology
of satisfaction was concerned primarily with the necessary payment of
debt to satisfy God's honor impugned by sin (and, as Timothy Gor- ringe
notes, to protect the social order represented by the divine cosmic
order), 1 [Calvin's]{.underline} [[theology]{.underline}
[emphasizes]{.underline}]{.mark} [legal [punishment for sin which must
be borne by someone]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gorringe summarizes it
succinctly: "In Anselm Christ pays our debts; in Calvin he bears our
pun- ishment."2 He traces how such [retributive theology reflects and is
reflected in legal penal practice]{.underline}; similarly T. Richard
Snyder identifies a "spirit of punishment" at play in Amer- ican
Protestant theology tracing back to its emphasis on the fallenness of
creation and the individualized nature of salvation.3 [In the United
States, [penal practice]{.mark} [**cannot** be separated from]{.mark}
the history of **[white supremacy]{.mark}** and racial
control]{.underline}. Michelle Alexander has laid out the history of how
[[mass incarceration]{.mark} since the 1960s [was built up as]{.mark} a
form of [racial control]{.mark}, a "**new Jim Crow**]{.underline}."4
Kelly Brown Douglas [presents mass incarceration as]{.underline} an
expression of [American "stand your ground" culture designed [to
protect]{.mark} the "[cherished]{.mark} property" of [whiteness against
purported threats from Black]{.mark} and indigenous
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 Rima Vesely-Flad's work is of particular
interest; she draws connections between America's Protestant history and
its carcerality through the lens of "social pollution." Historically,
Vesely- Flad suggests, [[Blackness has been viewed]{.mark} [as a kind
of]{.mark} "**[social pollution]{.mark}**" in the body
politic]{.underline}; this is closely related to Douglas' understanding
of "stand your ground" culture as intended to preserve the public square
for whiteness. Vesely-Flad goes further to explore how [the view of
Black people as socially polluted is [then **moralized**]{.mark} into an
understanding of them [as]{.mark} "**[morally polluted]{.mark}**,"
[so]{.mark} that [harsh punishment and criminalization are perceived as
a necessary response]{.mark} to such moral pollution]{.underline}. 6
Resistance against such racialized logics of punishment and
criminalization has taken various forms: most pertinently, in the
movement for prison-industrial complex abol- ition and the practices of
restorative/transformative justice. These related movements present two
distinct emphases that shed light on what atonement requires. First,
aboli- tionists emphasize the social construction of crime and the need
to think systemically about whose interests and power are served by
police/prisons, and especially how police and prisons function to
maintain racialized and capitalist hierarchies (see, for example, the
work of Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore). At the same time,
restorative and transformative justice proponents (such as Howard Zehr,
Danielle Sered, Creative Inter- ventions, and others, as well as Davis)
focus on building the alternate ways of responding to harm that are
necessary in order to, in Davis' terms, "make prisons obsolete."7 Both
emphases are essential. Abolition requires a systemic viewpoint that
accounts for the inequitable social realities affecting every act of
harm and the societal construction of crime and punishment. But
abolition also requires that we deal creatively with real harm and
violence that occur -- and the complex reality that each of us are both
harmed and responsible for doing harm to others during our lives
(sometimes at the same time), and that those who do harm were often
themselves victims of violence first. 8 Ontologically, we are
simultaneously victims and perpetrators of harm. The language of
"victims" and "perpetrators" has been justly critiqued as losing the
nuance that every person both does harm and is harmed in favor of a
false binary; while recent restorative justice practice has tended
toward language of "harmed party" and "responsible party" or similar, I
am using the syntactically-shorter victim-perpetra- tor language for
simplicity. But we must remember that "victim" and "perpetrator" are not
characteristics of people but rather roles in a particular situation of
harm; both can apply to each of us. This reality, that everyone has done
harm and been harmed, is central to my theological anthropology and my
abolitionist praxis, and indeed central to my argument here for the
complex nature of divine solidarity in atonement. The multiplicity of
our existence simultaneously as victims and perpetrators is an essen-
tial element of the theological anthropology underlying my atonement
theology. Nonetheless, such subjectivity cannot be constructed
separately from the ways that racial dynamics affect who is constructed
as criminalized or a "perpetrator" of violence and who is constructed as
a "suitable" victim of violence. 9 Feminist and womanist [theo- logians
have raised objections to [substitutionary atonement]{.mark} in part
because of its [reinfor- cing]{.mark} effects on racialized systems of
punishment and control, in light of the societal imbrication of the
identification of perpetrators of harm with the [racialized
construction]{.mark} [of certain persons as
"criminalized]{.mark}]{.underline}." Nikia Smith Robert's "liberation
theology for lock- down America" emphasizes the role that Anselmian
[substitution plays in supporting racialized mass incarceration: Applied
allegorically to the contemporary social context of the Carceral State,
not Christ but [Black bodies become the sacrifice for human
sin]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is to say, [in the feudal economy as in
the Carceral State [there is an analogous]{.mark} hierarchical
[relationship]{.mark} where lords can be under- stood interchangeably
with dominant privileged society and [serfs with the **criminalization
of the subaltern**]{.mark}]{.underline} ... . Hence, Anselm's feudal
[cosmology of salvation and the U.S. criminal justice system have this
in common: both are religious, retributive, and require the sacrifice of
a lower class]{.underline}.10 For Robert, the liberating work of God is
found not in atoning "systems of sacrifice" but in "creat\[ing\]
disruptive spaces of resistance to forge community, restore personhood,
overthrow oppressive structures of power and secure human
flourishing."11 Williams, meanwhile, resists notions of atonement that
depend on making Jesus a "surrogate" for humans, instead emphasizing
salvation through his "ministerial vision of right relationships."12
Meanwhile, Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock identify
substitutionary narratives of atonement as replicating abusive power
dynamics, "cosmic child abuse."13 [[Substitutionary atonement]{.mark}
has formed part of an American Christian conceptual matrix [encouraging
harsh punishment]{.mark} and incarceration, [in connection with a
racialized conception of]{.mark} [criminalization]{.mark} and "moral
pollution]{.underline}." As Robert notes, [when the need for punishment
is reified in God, those who are already marginalized -- [Black
Americans]{.mark} -- [are]{.mark} the ones [scapegoated in the name
of]{.mark} such [divinely-acceptable punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Can any- thing of this theological theme be salvaged for a liberatory
theology? Constructing a reverse discourse Given the many harmful
effects that "penal substitution" concepts have had on American penal
practice, why try recovering any sort of substitutionary doctrine of
atonement? Can substitution as a theme be saved? I believe it can; that
it is possible to construct a "reverse discourse" (to borrow Foucault's
language) within the broad traditions of substitutionary atonement, to
provide a theory of substitution as divine solidarity with both victims
and perpetrators of harm, in a way that undermines the retributive logic
of incarceration. Why bother? Why not let the concept of substitution
go? I offer two arguments for the value of reclaiming such language in
resistance against the way it has been used for oppression: First, the
reality is that substitutionary language is still a dominant paradigm in
the church and a source of comfort to many, in the concreteness of its
promise of reconcilia- tion with God, illustration of the lengths God
will go to for us, and God's "affinity" with us in suffering (to borrow
a term from Jon Sobrino).14 As long as "substitution" and the related
"sacrifice" remain potent symbols in Christian thinking and ritual, new
liberatory interpretations of them offer a way to couch concepts
supporting abolition in familiar terms. On solely pragmatic grounds,
engaging with such terms provides an avenue for persuasion that simply
rejecting them does not. But more importantly, the hard questions about
punishment, retribution, and forgive- ness raised by substitutionary
theories expose real and important tensions in the work for non-carceral
responses to harm. Mark Heim writes that the cross represents the truth
that forgiveness is costly, even if the crucifixion is not understood as
a precondition for divine forgiveness.15 He phrases it in psychological
terms in his discussion of Anselm, suggesting that Anselm's replacement
of a human scapegoat with a divine sca- pegoat offers a way out of the
psychological needs of victims for vengeance and the guilty to make
infinite restitution.16 Fleming Rutledge couches her discussion of
substitution in the resistance to "impunity"17 and what is owed to
victims of harm. 18 Samuel Pillsbury similarly argues for the need for
criminal punishment to represent the community's rejection of the "moral
disregard" underlying acts of violence. 19 Sered lays out the inter-
personal debt owed to victims concisely: "It is my belief that when we
hurt people, we owe something, and one of the things we owe is to face
what we have done."20 Violence and harm must be addressed. Something is
"owed" to victims of harm, and those respon- sible for doing harm have
the primary responsibility to address what is owed. My point here is not
to argue for the necessity of criminal punishment, but rather to lift up
the validity of the desire for retribution in response to harm: the
sense that some- thing must be paid. Without such a recognition of the
validity of victims' anger and the debt owed them, theories of divine
forgiveness can become coercive calls for victims to forgive without
reparations. If God in Christ forgives the trespasses against God
without cost, what right do human victims have to demand repayment of
the interpersonal debt owed to them? This is not to say that restorative
or transformative responses to harm must take the form of repayment or
restitution. Often, restorative/transformative justice takes more
creative forms of healing and transformation -- especially where
reparations or restitution are unobtainable (because of systemic biases)
or impossible (as in cases of violence where the trauma cannot be
undone). But to explore such creative forms of justice requires us first
to deal honestly with the questions of debt and restitution, and the
related desire for vengeance and retribution. I address these questions
through the lens of atonement in order to lay the groundwork for further
creative and communal acts of justice -- justice that may transcend the
conceptual logics of debt, restitution, and reparations, but cannot
ignore them.21 The symbolic language of debt forgiveness holds an
unavoidable place in the Christian theology of abolition, e.g., in
Jesus' proclamation of the coming reign of God at the begin- ning of his
ministry (Luke 4:17--21) in which he declares that he has been anointed
"to set the prisoners free" and to "declare the year of the Lord's
favor" -- the latter a direct refer- ence to the traditions of the
Sabbath and Jubilee years described in Leviticus 25 and Deu- teronomy
15.22 The rules surrounding the Sabbath and Jubilee years require the
forgiveness of monetary debt, and relatedly the freedom of those who had
sold them- selves into bondage. Griffith explains the Sabbath and
Jubilee years as not only a law gov- erning monetary debt but more
broadly as a politico-economic anamnesis of the primary liberating
action of God, the exodus from Egypt, writing: "It was on the basis of
God's liberation of the slaves that a covenant was established with
Israel, and it was also on the basis of that history of liberation that
Israel was to observe the Sabbath and Jubilee. ... The proclamations of
liberty to the captives were concrete social responses to God's lib-
erating activity in the exodus of Israel from Egypt."23 According to
Griffith, during the Babylonian captivity this symbol of liberation from
slavery was extended to the liberation of all prisoners, so that by the
time of Jesus' proclamation in Galilee, the Jubilee "year of the Lord's
favor" could be understood to involve the general freeing of captives as
well as the forgiveness of monetary debts.24 In the modern case of those
imprisoned for crimes -- those serving what some call their "debt to
society" -- these two understandings of the "year of the Lord's favor"
coalesce: the Jubilee year is when those in prison are set free, even
those who have incurred interpersonal debts (as opposed to monetary
ones) through interpersonal harm, because captives are freed and debts
forgiven in God's Jubilee. Ched Myers and Elaine Enns similarly analyze
the relational, not simply economic, consequences of the Sabbath/Jubilee
traditions in their analysis of 2 Corinthians 5:18-- 19: "The unilateral
seventh- and forty-ninth-year 'release' from debt-bondage ... is alluded
to in God's decision 'not to count our trespasses against us' (the
explanatory addition in 2 Cor 5:19). Christ heralds the renewal of this
divine economy of grace: the old 'debt system' is passing away."25 For
them, this divine practice of debt-forgiveness has immediate practical
applications for how we deal with crime and harm: "The deeply engrained
retributive logic of the domination system -- the way we think
'according to the flesh' -- stipulates that debtors must be imprisoned
and offenders punished. In stark con- trast, God models in Christ the
practice of victim-initiated reconciliation."26 But applying the
originally economic language of debt forgiveness to the interpersonal
debt incurred by harm makes certain claims about the nature of the
relationship between the parties. This is particularly challenging when
debt is used to describe the human- divine relationship. Devin Singh has
explored ways that the prevalence of debt language within atonement
theories has the problematic result of "an incorporation of debt into
the identity of God."27 My reinterpretation of the concept of
substitution here does not presume that the debt in question is our debt
to God, but instead our interpersonal debts to one another as a result
of harm and violence. This bears similarity to J. Denny Weaver's
proposal of sin as primarily being expressed through "distorted social
relation- ships."28 It also brings to mind the older "ransom" theory of
the atonement -- in which the debt paid by Jesus on the cross is a debt
owed to the devil, not to God -- rather than Anselmian views of
"satisfaction" owed to God. Instead of a debt to the devil, though, I am
proposing that substitution is a helpful symbol for expressing the
divine interruption of the transfer of interpersonal debts that we owe
to one another. As such, what I am offering here is a new atonement
theology, not claiming an older Anselmian or Calvinist tradition of
substitution that reifies God as "demanding" payment of debt or
punishment. God does not demand debt or punishment, but, according to my
theory, substitutionary language in atonement can be helpful in
expressing how God intervenes in the world to transform interpersonal
harm, violence, debt, and retribution. Of course, it is not as simple as
the divine payment of our moral debts to one another. The challenge is
how to hold the Jubilee tradition of forgiveness -- a tradition that
goes beyond monetary debt to also address moral/interpersonal/relational
debt -- in tension with the very real interpersonal debt of harm which
requires reparations: to overcome debt without nulli- fying it. What I
would propose, then, is that the concept of substitution in relation to
the crucifixion offers a symbolic way to hold in tension the truths of
divine and human forgiveness, which comes only at a cost, and the
necessity for repayment of the interpersonal debt of harm, which should
nonetheless not justify violent retribution (including the state
violence of incarceration). I will turn now to consider the mech- anisms
by which substitutionary concepts can undermine the basis of retributive
systems: first, by engaging with Heim's work on scapegoating violence in
relation to the crucifixion and considering the applicability of his
argument to retribution more broadly; and then by considering
"substitution" through the lens of divine soli- darity with humanity.
Scapegoating, retribution, and the transfer of debt Heim's Girardian
reading of the crucifixion offers a helpful starting place for
attempting to reconstruct a substitutionary theory. Heim argues that the
"problem" addressed by the crucifixion is the problem of scapegoating,
as identified by René Girard: that in order to overcome the tendency for
societies to erupt into uncontrolled retribution and violence,
individuals are sacrificed as scapegoats, a violence veiled in sacred
language and practice so that it is not seen as violence. Heim writes
that Jesus' crucifixion presents a view of scapegoating violence from
the scapegoat-victim's perspective -- exposing it as violence, no longer
veiled by sacrality -- and Jesus' resurrection shows God's solidarity
with every victim of scapegoating, overcoming sacrificial violence. 29
Heim suggests that the Bible, across the Old Testament and particularly
in its interpretation of the crucifixion, offers an "ambivalent"
perspective that "testifies to an ongoing struggle," what he calls a
"stereo- scopic" view of scapegoating -- at times presenting sacrifice
as "good" sacred violence that upholds the community but at the same
time always maintaining an insistence on expos- ing its violence, for
the sake of ultimately letting Jesus' crucifixion both be recognizable
as a sacrifice and exposed as violence. 30 Heim's argument about the
crucifixion as an exposure and destruction of scapegoating violence -- a
divine intervention in a particular form of human violence31 -- has
immedi- ate relevance to the question of incarceration because of the
ways in which [the American criminal punishment system functions as a
tool of scapegoating violence]{.underline}. Robert ties this to the role
of sacrifice in America's religious history: "[America requires a
sacrifice for the Carceral State to function. [Prisons]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} therefore [needed to systemically produce delin- quents by
disenfranchising, disqualifying and dehumanizing]{.mark} the least of
these. [This normalization of criminalization]{.mark} engenders a
liturgy of punishment that essentially **[lega- lizes the sacrifice of
Black bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}."32 Heim himself admits the
scapegoating potential of criminalization. 33 However, he maintains a
distinction (which I do not think stands) between legal punishment of
the guilty and scapegoating violence for the sake of social peace; from
his perspective a crim- inal legal system offers another mechanism for
interrupting the cycle of escalating retri- bution and mimetic
violence.34 I think his view is too optimistic, and that the impersonal
justice of the entire [society]{.underline} -- as opposed to
interpersonal, communal restorative justice for harm -- [always has the
"shape" of sacrifice because]{.underline}, as Robert writes, [it always
is willing to sacrifice marginalized populations "to restore law and
order to safeguard the privilege and power of dominant
society]{.underline}."35 As Vesely-Flad has explained, [the criminal
legal system turns against marginalized people into "criminals" because
they are viewed as "morally polluted," not just because of actual guilt.
Any system of criminalization will face the pressure to make criminals
in response to perceived "moral pollution," not simply as an objective
response to actual guilt, and so any criminal legal system will tend
toward scapegoating]{.underline}. A similar tendency toward scapegoating
comes from Henri- que Carvalhos' and Anastasia Chamberlen's concept of
"hostile solidarity" against those guilty of harm.36 [[Hostile
solidarity]{.mark} [produces]{.mark} [solidarity among those
punishing]{.mark} [against]{.mark} [those]{.mark} who have been found
guilty]{.underline} -- promoting social peace by punishing the guilty as
scapegoats. In so doing, [it produces a sort of moral/social pollution
out of the fact of guilt for harm]{.underline}. Solidarity against those
who are guilty makes them into a "pol- luted" class, suitable for
scapegoating. This is the converse of the process described by
Vesely-Flad whereby [those constructed as "socially polluted" are then
deemed "morally polluted]{.underline}" -- instead, by the mechanism of
hostile solidarity, [actual guilt is [turned into moral/social
pollution]{.mark} promoting social solidarity against the
guilty]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline} tendencies [push a legal
system]{.underline}, even one intended to punish actual guilt, [toward a
system of sacred scapegoating violence]{.underline}. As Miroslav Volf
puts it: "The tendency of per- secutors to blame victims is reinforced
by the actual guilt of victims, even if the guilt is minimal and they
incur it in reaction to the original violence committed against them."37
For all these reasons, Heim's interpretation of the "sacrifice" of the
crucifixion as not sup- porting but rather exposing such violence is
directly relevant to efforts to undermine mass incarceration. Systems
intended to punish the guilty inevitably become sites of scapegoating.
However, I would argue that Heim's system can be extended further, to
understand the crucifixion as undermining not only scapegoating as it
appears in the modern crim- inal legal system but also the "sacred
violence" of retribution in all its forms. In other words, I argue that
there is something essential to the nature of retribution which makes
systems of criminal punishment inevitably tend toward scapegoating
violence. I return here to the question of debt. Above, I laid out the
case, made eloquently by Sered, that the debt owed to victims of harm by
those who have harmed them is real and must not be set aside.

#### Plea bargains commodification suffering as something to be bargained with reifies substitutionary atonement that fuels anti-black retributive sacrifices of black and brown bodies.

Above, I laid out the case, made eloquently by Sered, that the debt owed
to victims of harm by those who have harmed them is real and must not be
set aside. Retribution, however, is not the same as restitution or
reparations. [[Retribution]{.mark} [relies on the]{.mark}
"**[fungibility]{.mark}**" [of debt]{.mark}: the key underlying concept
of retribution is that the debt of harm owed to the victim can be
transferred -- in the form of punishment, the intentional infliction of
harm -- back onto the perpetrator]{.underline}. In retribution, [[the
debt of harm]{.mark}, rather than remaining an unchangeable obligation
from the perpetrator to the victim, instead [becomes a
commodity]{.mark}, [a calculable and interchangeable]{.mark} "amount of
[suffering]{.mark} [owed]{.mark}" which can be repaid through further
violence and suffering on the part of another (the
perpetrator]{.underline}). The connections to the sacred violence of
scapegoating appear. In the Girardian sca- pegoating relation, what is
owed or what "must be paid" to restore social peace is trans- ferred
onto the scapegoat. The actual violence of the murder of the scapegoat
is hidden under the veil of the sacred.38 Per Heim, [[the scapegoating
sacrifice represents an erasure of the violence that threatened the
social order]{.mark}, while the violence of the sacrifice itself is
ignored]{.underline}. In retribution, it is similar: [[what "must be
paid" is transferred onto the perpe- trator in the form of
suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The]{.mark} actual [violence of
punishment]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the fact that the imposition of
suffering by state powers is an act of violence -- [[is hidden under
the]{.mark} sacred [veil of "justice]{.mark}]{.underline}." [The symbols
and rituals of [courtroom]{.mark} [procedure]{.mark} -- themselves an
expression of civil sacrality -- [hide the violence of **judicial
murder** and]{.mark} [incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even more
directly, [the invisibility of the suffering in prisons, because they
are secretive, remote, and intentionally hidden from the public eye,
hides the violence of punitive incarceration]{.underline}. [Retribution
and [state punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}, like scapegoating, [[promise
social safety while hiding the cost of the violence done by the
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. The major difference between scapegoating
and retribution is in the innocence of the victim. Heim protests that
measured retribution against a guilty perpetrator can be defended, and
that the scapegoating mechanism is only relevant [where [the guilt
attribu- ted to the perpetrator is dissociated from the magnitude of
their factual guilt]{.mark}]{.underline}. 39 I disagree, and suggest
that the essential element in sacred violence is not the innocence (or
at least, relative innocence compared to attributed guilt) of the
scapegoat victim, but instead pre- cisely the "fungibility" of the debt
of harm that allows for its transfer into further vio- lence -- which is
in effect in both Girardian scapegoating and retribution. The
perpetrator may be actually guilty: but [[once the debt of harm is made
fungible]{.mark} and trans- ferred back in violence against them, [the
stage is set for scapegoating]{.mark}]{.underline}. Understanding such
debt as transferrable is the basis for its further transfer to a
(perhaps innocent) sca- pegoat. Instead of trying to limit retribution
only to the "sufficiently guilty," I am suggesting, the sacrifice of God
on the cross instead offers a way of interrupting every such transfer of
the debt of harm, and cuts off retribution at the start. [The concept of
the "**[fungibility]{.mark}**" of debt at play in retribution also
[raises the]{.mark} [problem of using economic debt language to address
social obligations]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is worth returning briefly
to Singh, who presents the history of debt in penal theory as providing
a sort of scape- goating transfer: he describes how [[debt to be repaid
between parties]{.mark} in cases of harm [was]{.mark} gradually
[replaced by debt paid to the sovereign authority through the penal
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. 40 His response in general is to
[deconstruct the use of debt as a category for describing interpersonal
obligation]{.underline}. I am suggesting here that instead of
jettisoning such debt language, we jettison the move by which the "debt"
of interpersonal obligation is constructed in economic terms as a
fungible or transferrable commodity. [Such an attempt to decouple the
concept of "interpersonal debt of harm" from economic under- standings
of debt is particularly urgent given the realities of the greater burden
of debt for the poor and marginalized]{.underline}. My goal is to reach
an understanding of interpersonal debt (as used by Sered, for example)
that holds space for the necessity of restitution and reparations for
harm while not upholding economic or retributive debt logics. I propose
that the cross's exposure of the violence of retribution provides one
way to [unsettle an economized, fungible understanding of interpersonal
debt]{.underline}. Heim's discussion of the crucifixion focuses on the
passion narratives as presenting a scapegoating sacrifice from the
scapegoated victim's point of view, exposing the violence against the
scapegoat. 41 Scapegoating and retribution are not identical, but I
would use a parallel method to argue that the crucifixion also exposes
retribution as sacred violence. Here is where the language of
substitution becomes unavoidable. If Jesus is understood as a substitute
for the guilty who are punished by retributive violence; if by "bearing
the sins of the world" (cf. John 1:29) and "becoming sin for us" (cf. 2
Cor. 5:21) we understand him to be suffering the "just punishment" due
to others, repaying the (real) debt of harm as it is transferred by
retribution: if we posit these traditional assumptions, then Jesus'
suffering and its expression in the passion narratives unavoidably
exposes the violence inherent in retribution. We cannot veil it in
sacred narratives of justice or repayment. Once the debt of harm is
constructed as a fungible commodity, able to be transferred by
retribution, then "substitutionary atonement" means that God, in Jesus,
is able to "take on" that transferred debt in place of the guilty party,
and in so doing reveal the vio- lence of such a transference. Heim's
explication of the revelation of the crucifixion as the "sacrifice to
end sacrifice"42 provides a mechanism for divine interposition, through
sacrifice, into the transfer of debt in retribution. God's substitution
in Jesus reveals the similarity between retribution and scapegoating and
the violence underlying both. My point is not that God must literally
pay the debt of retribution in order for guilty parties to somehow avoid
it. It is instead to suggest that God's intervention in the atone- ment
interrupts the transfer of the debt owed to the victim back onto the
perpetrator in retribution; in a substitutionary model Jesus "steps in"
and the debt is laid on him, and thereby the violence is made visible.
Jesus, as scapegoat, takes the suffering which was described as "just
payment of debt" by perpetrators onto himself, and thereby exposes it as
the violence it is. The violence of Jesus' death forces the question: is
this violence wrong only because it happened to Jesus, an "innocent
scapegoat"? Or would the violence also have been wrong if it were
applied to the guilty party in retribution?43 I am offering a sort of
proof by contradiction: If the debt of harm is in fact fungible and
understood to be transferred in a form of "justice," then it can also be
understood to be transferred, by divine act, from the guilty party onto
Jesus: but Jesus' passion makes visible to us the extent of violence
involved in such a payment of debt. When the debt is transferred to
Jesus and "paid" by his suffering, we see it for the violence it is and
reject such violence as effective payment. Therefore, we conclude that
the debt of harm is not fungible; it cannot be transferred by suffering;
further violence does not repay the debt. The divine revelation provided
by the symbol of substitution interrupts the logic of retribution by
which the debt of harm is turned back onto perpetrators. It exposes the
violence of such logic. Reparations cannot be replaced with punishment.
The abiding debt to victims cannot be satisfied with the violence of
punishment or suffering on the part of perpetrators: instead, the
interpersonal debt to victims is indelible until reparations and
restitution are made. If sufficient reparations are impossible, the debt
remains---although perhaps it can be transformed. Where then does
atonement occur? Solidarity as a mechanism of atonement for victims and
perpetrators

Constructing unequal members: citizen or criminal? There is an expansive
literature on the construction and meaning of citizenship in various
contexts, a full review of which is beyond the scope of this project.
For the purposes of this examination, I will employ a working definition
of "citizenship" as the position that a person occupies in the political
communities to which they belong, in relation to other members. This
position is, in part, chosen or affirmed by the person, and in part
consti- tuted intersubjectively. I use this definition, in part, because
it recognizes the plurality of political communities to which a person
might belong, and also because it emphasizes the relational nature of
citizenship.5 This concept of citizenship is an expansive one, encom-
passing legal citizenships, but also including less formal (but still
vitally important) aspects of the experience of membership in a
political community. This article critiques the pro- duction of one
category (criminality) that can affect a person's position in a
significant and negative fashion. While [being [label]{.mark}ed
[a]{.mark} "[criminal]{.mark}" [is]{.mark} likely [to]{.mark}
[**distort** a]{.mark} person's [experience of
citizenship]{.mark}]{.underline}, I do not claim that being placed in
this category displaces or eclipses other identities that also
constitute the experience of citizenship. However, because this article
is a critique of the separation of "criminals" from "citizens," it will
focus primarily on the significance of the criminal label.
"[[Criminality]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[is]{.mark} an idea]{.underline}
that is [too often [naturalized]{.mark}]{.underline}, a tendency
critically examined in much of Foucault's work (and in that of others
building on his foundations) (Dilts 2012, 2014; Foucault 1995, 2004,
2010). Nonetheless, even relatively recent [scholarship is given to
employing [the category of "criminal" as one that comes into being,
**unbidden**]{.mark}, with the commission of an act forbidden by
law]{.underline}. Casual references to "criminals" or "common criminals"
appear in numerous prominent texts (Arendt 1993, 161; Honig 1993; Rawls
1971, 240, 270, 314--315, 575--577; Shklar 1993, 188). Richard Dagger,
for example, asserts that "By stealing my property or robbing me of the
use of an eye or arm, the criminal also leaves me less free to go about
my life" (Dagger 2011, 48). Jeremy Waldron, similarly, refers to Locke's
depiction of "crooks" (Waldron 2002). This transformation from citizen
into criminal, however, is not given. "[Criminal" is **not a natural
kind**, any more than "citizen" is; both categories are
constructed]{.underline}. [Collateral con- sequences aggregate people on
the basis of what is perceived to be a common characteristic --
"criminality" -- but criminality is not an identifiable quality of any
person]{.underline}. Rather, it is a construct that is produced and
reified by policies like collateral consequences. [[Collateral
consequences are]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[invidious producers
of the]{.mark} [category of "criminal" because they extend **beyond
conviction**]{.mark}, beyond the period of punishment, and follow those
subject to them back into the course of their "free" lives, sometimes
for lengthy periods]{.underline}. [By intruding into post-punishment
life, [they reinforce the idea]{.mark} that [a person]{.mark} who has
com- mitted a criminal offense [is a fundamentally]{.mark}
[different]{.mark} kind of [person]{.mark}]{.underline} from their
fellows, [[one]{.mark} [who]{.mark} simply [**deserves** unequal]{.mark}
[treatment]{.mark}, regardless of how weak the justification for a
particular restriction may be]{.underline}. One condition commonly held
to legitimize coercion in a democratic society is that any harm
inflicted or limitation placed on a member of the demos must be
reasonably justifi- able to the person subject to it.6 Charles Larmore,
for instance, argues that acknowledging that the person coerced is owed
a justification is a necessary part of recognizing their indi- vidual
worth (Larmore 1999, 608). Recognizing other citizens' claims to
justification can also be productive of a particular kind of equal
relationship among community members one rooted in civic friendship (A.
Lister 2013). Regardless, [[to coercively burden]{.mark} or restrict
certain [members]{.mark} of a polity [without]{.mark} offering them
sufficient, reasonable [justification]{.mark} for doing so is to treat
them unequally without good reason]{.underline}. In short, [it [is to
treat them as]{.mark} if they inhabited a position [inferior]{.mark} to
those of their fellow members]{.underline} not similarly bur- dened or
restricted. By placing legal limitations on some members of the polity
without offering them a reasonable justification,
[communities]{.underline} that [impose collateral consequences treat
those subject to them as something **less than equal**
members]{.underline}. Avishai Margalit posits that humi- liation can
result only from human action, and that [[members]{.underline}]{.mark}
of a particular society [[suffer humiliation]{.mark} when [their
polity]{.mark}]{.underline} (through direct actions or the creation of
conditions) [supplies them with reasons to [feel that their self-respect
has been injured by those]{.mark} actions or
[conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Margalit 1996, 9--12). Margalit's
definition of humiliation, because it emphasizes human action and
relationality, is particularly well suited to conceptualizing political
humiliation, and so it is the one employed in this article. The practice
of imposing collateral consequences on former offenders produces a group
of citizens who are not only liable to suffer substantial limitations on
their abilities to enjoy the benefits and recognition of equal
citizenship, but who also have good reasons to feel humiliated by this
treatment.7 [Collateral consequences of conviction reach many facets of
the everyday experience of citizenship for those bearing
them]{.underline}, but the next sections will focus on three aspects of
citi- zenship as average Americans commonly experience it. I will first
examine how [certain [collateral consequences strip citizens]{.mark} [of
their anonymity]{.mark}; [registries single out]{.mark} certain par-
ticularly unpopular [citizens for public exposure]{.mark}, [despite
their terms of punishment]{.mark} [having]{.mark} nominally
[concluded]{.mark}]{.underline}. I evaluate the justifiability of such
policies by analyzing the disjunc- ture between the stated purposes of
offender registries and their actual effects. Second, I will survey
restrictions placed on what have been described as some of the core
activities of citizenship and consider historical justifications offered
for similar exclusions, why those justifications have been abandoned,
and which possible reasons could sufficiently justify these atavistic
policies in the current era. Third, I will consider a sampling of econ-
omic restrictions placed on former convicts, situating these limitations
within the context of equality of standing. Before delving into cases, I
will give a brief account of how criminality and citizenship have been
constructed in liberal political thought and in the Anglo-American legal
tradition. The historical separation of "citizen" and "criminal"

Concluding remarks This article expands the scope of discourse about
collateral consequences beyond disen- franchisement, examining the ways
in which [[state-imposed marks of]{.mark} **[inferior
membership]{.mark}** [separate criminal from citizen and humiliate
former offenders]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus [undermining]{.underline}
the equality constitutive of [democratic citizenship]{.underline}.
Because each person inhabits a unique pos- ition in a multiplicity of
overlapping socio-political networks, there is no single, paradig- matic
experience of "citizenship" against which others can be judged (Young
1989). Forging a single, comprehensive vision of "full citizenship" has
not been the aim of this article -- nor do I claim that every person
subject to collateral consequences will have an identical experience as
a result. Rather, this article represents an attempt to identify and
critique the role of [seemingly [benign]{.mark}, small-scale legal
restrictions]{.underline} in the [production and reification of an
ever-growing category of criminalized citizens in the United
States]{.underline}. [The imposition of [collateral consequences helps

character]{.mark}.]{.underline} By treating criminalized citizens not
merely as people who have committed offenses (discrete acts), but as a
different type of person (a "criminal"), an implicit category of the
"good citizen" is created in the negative space. [[Setting aside]{.mark}
a category of "[criminals]{.mark}"]{.underline} (like other attempts to
exclude certain groups from full membership)
[[reinforces]{.underline}]{.mark} a vision of what Iris Marion Young
criticized as "**[[undifferentiated citizenship]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
or the idea that [demo- cratic citizenship is characterized by
uniformity]{.underline}, [an image [that]{.mark} **[artificially
homogenizes]{.mark}** [the citizenry and]{.mark} **[reclassifies
difference as deviance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Young 1989). One
particularly insidious feature of [this construction of criminality is
that it is highly moralized, purporting to be based on the inherent
moral character of the person subjected to unequal]{.underline}
[treatment. That [moralization provides a **smokescreen**, allowing
non-criminalized citizens to]{.mark} deny the importance of
intersectionality and systemic biases, and to [claim]{.mark} these
[distinctions are based]{.mark} solely [in an impartial]{.mark},
[individualized idea of desert]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By presenting
"citizen" and "criminal" as durable and mutually exclusive categories,
collateral consequences undermine the equal standing of those subject to
them]{.underline}. [Collateral consequences are fundamentally
incompatible with democratic politics]{.underline}. As this article has
argued, [they create a large and ever-growing class of criminalized
citizens]{.underline} whose unequal treatment is not adequately
justified, and [whose polities subject them to humiliating
conditions]{.underline} as a result. As illustrated here, there are
strong grounds upon which to challenge the ostensible justifications for
many of these restrictions, which are based as much (or more) on
unsupported generalizations and essentialized depictions of criminality
than on harm prevention or a reasonable public interest. Indeed, the
very idea of collateral consequences rests upon the same
generalizations. The production of a group of people who can be
subjected to humiliating conditions and to whom unequal treatment need
not be fully justified constitutes the creation of a form of
second-class citizenship that is inimical to democratic equality.

B. Collateral Consequences The impact of [incarceration is exacerbated
by [collateral consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}.131 Collateral
consequences are [**hidden sanctions** or civil disabilities that emerge
automatically at the onset of a criminal conviction]{.underline}.132
They are referred to as "hidden" since [they are not formally
quantifiable in a sentence or imposed penalty]{.underline}.133 The
reference to "civil disability" reflects the social impact of
stigmatization associated with a felony conviction.134 Chief Justice
Earl Warren noted: "[Conviction of a felony [imposes a status
upon]{.mark} a person [which]{.mark} not only [makes him **vulnerable**
to future sanctions]{.mark} [through new **civil disability**
statutes]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} which also seriously [affects his
reputation and economic opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}."135
According to the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of
Conviction: Unlike the direct consequences of conviction, such as
imprisonment and fines, the indirect --- or [[collateral]{.mark} ---
[consequences]{.mark} of convictions rarely play a prominent role
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} sentencing or [[**plea** negotiations]{.mark}
and [are]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[not discussed]{.mark} with the
accused]{.underline}. [These [sanctions]{.mark} [and
disqualifications]{.mark} [are **automatically triggered**]{.mark} by a
conviction [but are not part of the punishment set out
by]{.mark}]{.underline} sentencing or [[a plea
deal]{.underline}]{.mark}.136 The most commonly known [[collateral
consequences are restrictions on **voting**]{.underline}]{.mark} 137 and
[[firearm]{.mark} ownership]{.underline}.138 Collateral consequences
also impact **[[immigration]{.underline}]{.mark}** [status]{.underline};
thus, attorneys must inform clients during certain criminal proceedings
about potential ramifications. Based on the Supreme Court's ruling in
Padilla v. Kentucky,139 "criminal defense lawyers must advise their
noncitizen clients considering a guilty plea that they are likely to be
deported as a result."140 Despite the lack of awareness of collateral
consequences for the general public and attorneys alike, the
ramifications of collateral consequences are broad and expansive.141
These consequences lead to difficulty in gaining
**[[employment]{.underline}]{.mark}**,142 restrict access to
[professional [licenses]{.mark}]{.underline},143 limit [[financial
aid]{.mark} opportunities]{.underline},144 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
restrict access to [[public benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}.145 The
National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction created by
[[the]{.mark} [A]{.mark}merican [B]{.mark}ar
[A]{.mark}ssociation]{.underline} serves as a key learning tool for
gaining a deeper understanding about collateral consequences and their
lingering impact.146 It is a national [[database]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [over]{.underline} [[**44,000** collateral
consequences identified]{.underline}]{.mark} and analyzed.147 C. Hiring
and Employment Becoming gainfully employed is one of the key exit points
of the criminal justice system.148 Studies demonstrate that employment
can reduce recidivism and promote community-building.149 Employment
creates an opportunity for a formerly incarcerated individual to have a
second chance at life by providing for themselves and their families.150
This in turn impacts upward mobility, wealth-building, and one's overall
quality of life.151 Joblessness has been identified as the single most
important predictor of recidivism.152 Recidivism evaluates the rate at
which an individual returns to the criminal justice system after being
released from prison.153 An unemployed former offender is more than
twice as likely as an employed one to reoffend.154 The potential for a
brighter future for those who have been incarcerated is often
ignored.155 [[People are stigmatized by]{.mark} their
past]{.underline}.156 [A felony conviction then becomes [a]{.mark}
looming, [permanent "**Scarlet Letter**" that reads "**F" for
felon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, this analysis overlooks the
transformative power of a second chance. Fr. Gregory Boyle, founder of a
comprehensive reintegration social enterprise called Homeboy Industries,
best characterized the power of employment when he stated: "Nothing
stops a bullet like a job."157 His words serve as a reminder that job
opportunities can disrupt the cycle of incarceration and promote safe
communities.158 According to a 2017 ACLU report, "nearly 75 percent of
formerly incarcerated individuals are still unemployed a year after
release."159 Managers and Human Resource (HR) personnel recognize that
workers with a criminal record bring value and skills to the
workplace.160 A nationwide study showed that more than 80% "of managers
and 67% of HR professionals feel that the 'quality of hire' for workers
with criminal records is as high as or higher than that of workers
without records."161 Additionally, a majority of workers in all roles
are willing to work with employees who have criminal records.162 IV.

III\. THE IMPACT OF COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES ON THE AFRICAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITY'S ECONOMIC MOBILITY The future sustainability and vibrancy of
the United States economy is contingent upon full workforce
participation.102 This begins with cultivating the gifts and talents of
each individual.103 It is further manifested through unveiling the
limitless potential of innovation.104 The culmination of these elements
is the very essence of the American Dream---the power to work, build,
and create a brighter future.105 Unfortunately, the realization of this
dream is unobtainable for many who have a criminal record.106 [[A
criminal record can be a]{.mark} **relentless** and [**persistent**
impediment to employability]{.mark}]{.underline}, which negatively
impacts an individual's ability to contribute to the future of economic
development.107 [A criminal record can restrict one's access to
employment, higher education, and]{.underline} even [professional
licensure]{.underline}.108 An estimated "[**[70 million]{.underline}**
[Americans---one in three]{.underline}]{.mark} [adults---[have a
criminal record]{.mark}]{.underline},"109 [which poses [a]{.mark}n
active [barrier to economic and social mobility]{.mark}]{.underline}.110
Acclaimed attorney and author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in
the Age of Colorblindness, Michelle Alexander, describes this experience
as entering a parallel universe---"one that promises a form of
punishment that is often more difficult to bear than prison time: [[a
**lifetime** of shame, contempt, scorn, and
exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}."111 This parallel universe creates a
"tangled mass web of incarceration with far too many entry points into
the criminal justice system and far fewer exit points."112 A. The
Financial Impact of Mass Incarceration on the African- American
Community This tangled web of [incarceration has a disparate impact on
the quality of life experienced within the African-American community
due to the over-representation of African-Americans]{.underline} in the
criminal justice system.113 [The conjoined forces of [imprisonment and
blackness produce]{.mark} waves of [**lifelong** hardships for]{.mark}
those who are imprisoned, their families, and [the community]{.mark} at
large]{.underline}.114 [[Mass incarceration]{.underline}]{.mark} has
essentially [[evolved into]{.mark} [a]{.mark} large cohort of
a]{.underline} relatively [[**permanent** group of]{.mark} young male
offenders and [ex- offenders]{.mark}]{.underline}, [who for the most
part are [unlikely to be]{.mark}]{.underline} contributing [[members of
the work]{.mark} [force]{.mark}]{.underline} in the foreseeable
future.115 The [career outlook]{.underline} for this group of men [can
be **relegated** to]{.underline} situations of [under the table
economics or]{.underline} other [unscrupulous behavior]{.underline}; [a
felony record can temporarily disqualify employment in licensed or
professional occupations, skilled trades, or in the public
sector]{.underline}.116 Individual [[men that are
qualified]{.underline}]{.mark} for professional positions [[are
**derailed**]{.underline}]{.mark}.117 "[Incarceration diverts offenders
from career jobs through its effects on skills, social connections, and
criminal stigma]{.underline}."118 "[Men]{.underline} in trusted or
high-income occupations before conviction [experience especially large
earnings losses after release]{.underline}."119 Obtaining and retaining
long-term living wage positions are just some of the difficulties those
with criminal records face.120 [[The impact]{.mark} of low paying,
dead-end work [has **severe economic repercussions**]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} the support of [African-American
families]{.mark}]{.underline}.121 "For example, [[a black]{.mark}
30-year-old high school [dropout]{.mark} [with no]{.mark} prison
[record]{.mark} [will average]{.mark} nearly \$[9,000 a
year]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . ."122 When the factor of jail time is
added to the equation, ["\[[m\]en with]{.mark} prison [records]{.mark}
are estimated to [earn]{.mark} about 30 to [**40 percent** less
each]{.mark} [year]{.mark}]{.underline} than similar men who have never
been incarcerated."123 The difference in earnings can be seen in hourly
wages and racial comparisons; white former prisoners "experience
virtually no wage growth from their starting wage of \$10.61 an hour at
age 25."124 Layering in race, one sees that "\[[[a\] black man without a
criminal record]{.mark}, at age 25, [earns]{.mark} about [the same wage
as a white]{.mark} [man with a criminal record]{.mark}---around \$10.60
an hour]{.underline}."125 This one cent difference may seem
insignificant, yet over time the cumulative effect is demonstrated:
"\[h\]ourly wages for white men, who are involved in crime but never go
to prison, grow from \$11.18 to \$13.81 from age 25 to 35."126 African-
American men have different growth numbers: "[[Among black former
prisoners, wages grow only a **third** as fast]{.mark}---just **5
percent** from about \$9.85 to \$10.40]{.underline}."127 Analyzing these
hourly wages reveals that [[a **one cent** per hour difference]{.mark}
at age twenty-five grows to a \$3.41 per hour difference by age
35.]{.underline}128 [This small hourly pay differential in wages
[over]{.mark} a [ten-year]{.mark} period [amounts to \$**65,472** that
black families are short-changed]{.mark}]{.underline}.129 With the
combination of difficulties in acquiring longer-term, living wage
positions and maintaining salary growth over time, [[the earning]{.mark}
[potential for African-Americans]{.mark} [who have been
incarcerated]{.mark} [is **astronomically
dismal**]{.mark}]{.underline}.130 B. Collateral Consequences

#### Plea bargaining operates under a deception to commodify poor people of color for profit in private prisons

**Weil 12** \[Danny Weil, writer for Project Censored and Daily
Censored, 11-7-2012, \"Widespread Use of Plea Bargains Plays Major Role
in Mass Incarceration,\" Truthout,

[[Plea bargains are]{.mark} also [**essential** for stocking for-profit
prisons]{.mark} with a steady supply of \"customers\" for their
corporate shareholders.]{.underline} Plea bargaining both enlists and
perpetuates the principles of mass production, deception and mendacity,
which in turn are applied quite readily in the whole of our system of
criminal \"justice.\" [Plea bargaining has also become an essential
element of both mushrooming prison growth and the racially disparate
state of American prison populations, with the gravity of the burden
falling on the backs of blacks and Latinos. [Without plea bargaining,
the explosion in prison populations of color,]{.mark} especially those
of for-profit prisons, **[could never be
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In his paper, \"The Problem With Plea
Bargaining: Differential Subjective Decision Making as an Engine of
Racial Stratification in the United States Prison System,\" attorney and
sociologist Douglas Savitsky argues that: The [bargains struck by Black
defendants tend to be worse than those struck by similarly situated
white defendants.]{.underline} There are several reasons for this. Black
defendants are generally poorer, and they are thus less able to afford a
competent defense. Second, Black defendants tend to be in a position of
lower power than are white defendants. Additionally, and related,
because [[prison has become]{.mark} such [a large part of the
life]{.mark} course in parts [of the Black
community]{.mark}]{.underline}, the costs to prison are perceived as
being lower by Blacks than by whites. This perception puts Black
defendants in a worse bargaining position. American Justice: The Cult of
Efficiency and Deception The American judicial system has become one in
which [constitutional [**rights and protections are sacrificed**
through]{.mark} mendacity and [deception **to appeal to a cult of
judicial efficiency** and economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The public has
been lied to; [[plea bargaining]{.mark} does not make society safe or
tackle the problem of crime itself. This [is]{.mark} simply
[another]{.mark} necessary **[illusion]{.mark}** that is [funneled into
the minds of the populace to rationalize the **commodification** of
people for profit.]{.mark}]{.underline} The problem with all of this, as
the late thinker Hannah Arendt noted in her New York Review of Books
article \"Lying in Politics,\" is that: \"the trouble with lying and
deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion
of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide. In this sense,
truth, even if it does not prevail in public, possesses an ineradicable
primacy over all falsehoods.\" In reality, the current criminal justice
system has little to do with public safety, truth-telling or avoiding
falsehoods. [Many of those currently incarcerated and languishing in
for-profit or government prisons include nonviolent drug offenders and
those accused of parole-violation technicalities]{.underline}, such as
not having a job or missing a parole officer appointment. In reality,
[Americans are locked up for crimes, such as writing bad checks or using
drugs, that would rarely, if ever, produce prison sentences in other
countries]{.underline}. The United States incarcerates 2.3 million
criminals. The number of people on lockdown in America is more than that
in any other nation. [[The]{.mark} modern [criminal justice system
primarily serves the interests of the increasingly privatized]{.mark}
and financialized [prison-industrial complex]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which includes]{.underline}]{.mark}, among others, \"tough on crime\"
[[politicians]{.mark}, seedy bail [bondsmen]{.mark}, Wall Street-traded
for-profit [prison corporations]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the drug-testing
industry]{.mark}, [police and]{.mark} corrections officers, and parole
and [prison]{.mark} officers\' [unions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is well
known, or should be, that California\'s \"three strikes and you\'re
out\" provision was promoted by corrections officers because
[[**caging** humans is]{.mark} not only [good for
business]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it is the fiduciary responsibility of
the for-profit prison-industrial complex corporations]{.underline}. It
is no surprise, either, that the primary defenders of the
criminalization of marijuana are police and corrections officers\'
unions because this is the bread and butter of their professions.

### Contention 6: Rights Theory

#### Rights inalienable are and cannot be waived -- plea bargains commodify rights and privileges and fragments the collective consciousness' dedication to natural law rights and the common good

How Did We Get Here? The political, economic, and cultural evolution
from colonial America to the United States of America was generated by
the historical confluence of natural law principles and English
constitutionalism. As we will see, natu- ral law principles provided the
ideological framework for the adoption of positive English common law
and its emphasis on rights. The Declaration of Independence (1776)
appeared nearly 500 years after William of Ockham (1287--1347) first
introduced the idea of subjective rights. Originating with Roman law, in
the 17th century references to the inalienability of rights (what the
framers referred to as "unalienable" rights) can be found in the
writings of English philosophers, as well as the French Huguenots.
According to Edelstein, "During the eighteenth century, it was not
uncom- mon for philosophers, such as Francis Hutcheson, and theologians,
such as Richard Fiddes, to refer to our 'unalienable rights' or 'the
natural and inalienable rights of mankind'."54 Later, we will be
introduced to the physi- ocrats as they articulated the synthesis
between natural rights, the inalien- ability of rights, the
individualization of rights, and the liberty of contract as it manifests
in the United States. Edelstein argues that until around 1750 there was
little talk of subjective rights in France, but by 1750 French [phi-
losophers such as Voltaire, **Rousseau**]{.underline}, and
[Diderot]{.underline} were each dedicating their attention to
justifications for a regime of individual rights protections. Along with
the writings of John **[Locke]{.underline}** (which appear to have had
little influence upon late 17th- [or]{.underline} early 18th-century
French thinking), Thomas [Jefferson]{.underline} would have at his
disposal a prestigious epistemological herit- age to draw from when it
came to writing the American Declaration of Independence. The second
paragraph of the Declaration of Independence thunders with the
pronouncement: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
of Happiness."55 As we have seen, by 1776 Jefferson's pronouncement that
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were self-evident truths
could [lay claim to]{.underline} a long line of English and French
philosophers and theologians. His argu- ment that "Men" possessed
"unalienable rights" was comfortably consist- ent with 17th-century
French and English political theory. The "truths" to which Jefferson
referred flowed from Jefferson and his founding generation's adoption of
[natural law]{.underline} principles. The first paragraph of the
Declaration of Independence makes this clear: When in the Course of
human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the
Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume
among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which
the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect to
the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the Separation.56 Colonial Americans were not the
primary audience for the Declaration of Independence. Rather,
Jefferson's document was a political manifesto meant to generate
financial and military support from abroad in anticipation of war with
England.57 At bottom, the Declaration articulated the justification for
severance from England and was not an expression of the virtues that
would constitute the republic. Regardless, powerful and historically
[ubiquitous references to "self-evi- dent truths" and "unalienable
rights" remain animating principles of the collective American
imagination]{.underline}. It is colloquially understood to mean that
[once declared, the government of the United States may not take rights
away from its citizens; they are **unalienable**]{.underline}.58 But
what if I also argue that while rights may not be taken away, [[they may
equally not be given]{.mark} [away]{.mark}]{.underline}? That is,
generally speaking, [[rights only retain their efficacy if they are held
in common]{.underline}]{.mark}. This idea commences with the Greek
[philosophers]{.underline} who, according to Fuller, "[took it for
granted that [man]{.mark} as a political animal had [to find the good
life in a life shared with others]{.mark}]{.underline}."59 Writing in
the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas, perhaps the most influential natural
law phi- losopher, addressed the question of why the people were
required to obey the law. Assuming the laws are just, the first reason
articulated by [Aquinas pertained to a shared **[collective
consciousness]{.mark}**]{.underline} (what Emile Durkheim would later
refer to as the "conscience collective") [that [would manifest]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}round [normative adherence to law in the service of moral
action]{.mark}]{.underline}. The sec- ond point made by [Aquinas
emphasizes the relationship between law and the common good, where "[A
just law is one which is consistent with the requirements of natural
law]{.mark} -- that is, it is '[ordered to the common]{.mark}
[good']{.mark}]{.underline}."60 And furthermore, ["Law is nothing else
than an ordinance of reason for the common good, promulgated by him who
has the care of the community]{.underline}."61 In his powerful defense
of natural law, Professor Finnis makes the follow- ing argument with
regard to the prevailing principles guiding natural law jurisprudence:
For those \[natural law\] principles justify the exercise of authority
in com- munity. They require, too, that that authority be exercised, in
most cir- cumstances, according to the manner conveniently labeled the
Rule of Law, and with due respect for human rights which embody the
require- ments of justice, and for the purpose of promoting a common
good in which such respect for rights is a component.62 David Brooke
contends that [Finnis's natural law articulation of the purpose of law
is a]{.underline} more historically contemporary [aspiration that
"refers to an ideal potential use of [law]{.mark} to unlock and [promote
the common good of society subject to law]{.mark}]{.underline}."63 So,
while [the state through its various agents may not withdraw a
right]{.underline} that has been awarded to all citizens of the United
States (and non-citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment), [the companion
principle is the acknowl- edgment that citizens, by virtue of their
being self-same as Homo sapiens, are also constituted by those [rights
protections]{.mark}; they [signify our collective political]{.mark},
economic, and cultural [DNA]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Following]{.underline}]{.mark} Bailyn, and consistent with [[natural
law jurisprudence]{.underline}]{.mark} (especially [**Aquinas**,
**Kant**, and **Finnis**]{.underline}), "the
[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[constitutions]{.mark} existed to
[protect]{.mark} [were]{.mark}]{.underline} understood in the early
years of the period ... to be seen as [**[inalienable]{.mark}**,
indefeasible rights **[inherent]{.mark}** [in all people by virtue
of]{.mark} [their humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}."64 [[To permit]{.mark}
individual [Americans the "right" to give away their rights
would]{.mark}]{.underline}, in relatively short order, [[diminish their
efficacy]{.mark} for the common good]{.underline}. [[If an offer]{.mark}
of some benefit made by an agent of the state to a subject [leads to the
abdication of a right]{.mark} by that subject, [the state has
successfully **commodified** that]{.mark} [right]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The state actor has placed a "price" on a right in exchange for
receiving some benefit]{.underline}. To summarize, we understand that as
a general rule the state may not take rights away from us. However, it
is my strong contention, one that, as we have seen, is shared by a long
line of natural law theorists, that [[because]{.mark} [rights constitute
our **collective agreement**]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} how we organize
[our]{.mark}- selves in a [republic]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we]{.mark}
[may not abdicate our rights]{.mark} by willingly giving them over to
the state, regardless of the offered benefit]{.underline}. So perhaps at
first glance, paradoxically, while subjects possess a right, that right
does not belong to them. This is because a right is part of a complex
political, economic, and cultural code that provides a community (and a
nation) with shared norms and values that are prerequisites to the
survival of the republic.65 James Otis (1725--1783), a Revolution-era
attorney and early defender of the Constitution and the Republic, draws
a similar conclusion in reference to the slave trade. For Otis, a vocal
critic of slavery, especially as it was to manifest in the Constitution,
"[those who every day barter away other men's liberty will soon care
little for their own]{.underline}."66 Reference here to "[[bargaining
away lib- erties" is]{.mark} precisely [what]{.mark} [occurs during a
**plea bargain**]{.mark} -- the **commodification of
rights**]{.underline} -- an exchange or bargain that produces an offer
(from a prosecutor) and a benefit (for the defendant). In subsequent
chapters, I will develop more thoroughly the notion, shared by both
liberal economists and Marxist political economists but for signifi-
cantly different reasons, that it was only under capitalism, where
subjects were "free" to contract for labor as they saw fit given their
interests, skills, and available work, that "moral and legal duty can
reach its full develop- ment."67 Unshackled by previous modes of
production that normatively seg- mented labor and its opportunities for
work beyond that of slave, serf, or indentured servant, under the
capitalist mode of production white and most Northern black subjects
were now able to freely move about seeking the work that most suited
them and their needs. [It was the ability of subjects to "freely" and
privately contract for work that established the notions of exchange and
reciprocity far beyond the economic sphere to include the legal
sphere]{.underline}. After all, if subjects were the free-thinking,
freely acting, reasonable, rational beings promised by the
Enlightenment, their inherent autonomy should privilege subjective
decision-making about all manner of political, economic, and cultural
matters. As we will see, it is precisely [this notion of Homo
economicus]{.underline} (economic man) [freely engaging in contractual
relation- ships that frames prosecutors and defendants in a relationship
of exchange in the context of the plea]{.underline}. [The
commodification of rights appears as a natural outgrowth of]{.underline}
what the Marxist political theorist, Evgeny Pashukanis (1891--1937),
referred to as [the **Commodity Exchange Theory** of Legal and Moral
Duty]{.underline}.68 For Pashukanis, and for liberal economists, since
the foundation of American society was premised upon the capitalist mode
of production where liberty of contract and exchange were paramount,
that exchange-reciprocity would normatively affect legal and political
institutions since "[the legal subject is thus the legal counterpart of
the agreement]{.underline}."69 [The normativity of transactional
exchange in capitalism is fully present in the transactional nature of
legal exchanges]{.underline}. Whether the criminal legal system ought to
reflect this normativity of exchange is, however, another question
entirely. This point was firmly expressed by Justice Harlan when he was
confronted with the question in the 1898 case Thompson v. Utah70 --
"Should defendants be procedurally able to waive their right to a trial
by jury?" Consistent with natural law and preservation of the common
good, Justice Harlan was emphatic in his objection. In this chapter, I
argue for the historical relevance of the jury trial as a continuation
of common law practices that were established in England by the Magna
Carta in 1215 and later the English Bill of Rights in 1689. In the
American republic, [[the jury trial]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} considered [so **central**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the creation and survival of [the American
republic]{.underline} that [it is [included in]{.mark}]{.underline} both
the Constitution ([[Article III]{.underline}]{.mark} §2)
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Bill of Rights ([[Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Amendments]{.underline}]{.mark}). What [we find]{.underline} in
both England and the United States (as well as each of the colonial
constitutions prior to the Revolutionary War) was [a clearly articu-
lated commitment to transparency and fairness in the administration of
jus- tice]{.underline}. This was important for a number of reasons, the
most obvious of which was that [a jury of common people would determine
both law and fact in any criminal case]{.underline},71 thereby [serving
as a public check on the authority of the state]{.underline}. The second
reason that [trial by [jury was]{.mark} considered
**[imperative]{.mark}** was that it was considered to be [the
**most**]{.mark} publicly [**transparent** way to educate
citizens]{.mark} of the United States [on]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
centrality and [legitimacy of the rule of law]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Since]{.underline} [juries were responsible for deliberating over all
manner of civil and criminal cases, merely serving on a jury would
enhance one's]{.underline} worldview and [understanding of public
affairs]{.underline}. Moreover, Amar makes the point that [judges would
embrace trials as an opportunity to educate jurors, as well as the lay
public, on the meaning and purpose of the law]{.underline}. Finally, it
can be argued that [serving on a jury "was in part an intermediate
association designed to educate and social- ize its members into
virtuous thinking and conduct]{.underline}."72 Immediately, it must
occur to the curious reader that I have not yet addressed perhaps the
most important question relating to the founding gen- eration's
commitment to trial by jury in criminal cases: Are there rights, such as
those located in Article III §2 of the Constitution, and the Fifth,
Sixth, and Seventh Amendments, rights that, in the case of Article III
§2 language mandate trial by jury in all criminal proceedings, that are
so central to a republic that it cannot endure as a republic without
them? For example, is the application of executive prosecutorial power
manifest in the ability to charge, indict, prosecute, and convict of
such a magnitude of importance that transparency in the application of
that power is vital to the legitimacy of the criminal legal system?
Asked a bit differently, [[is it possible for a repub- lic to be true to
its promise if the criminal]{.mark} legal [system operated in **virtual
secrecy**]{.mark}]{.underline}? Clearly, our English and
founding-generation American ancestors were of the belief that there
were [rights so important that they were con- sidered "unalienable"; the
jury trial was one of those rights]{.underline}. It appears that for our
ancestors, [our republic could not flower under conditions of **opaque**
administration of justice]{.underline}. [Transparency in the criminal
legal system was **imperative**]{.underline}. [Beginning with the Magna
Carta]{.underline} ("The Great Charter") [and ending in
1930]{.underline} with the Patton v. United States case,73 the trial by
[a jury]{.underline} of 12 [was considered a vital]{.underline} [and
normative]{.underline} aspect of criminal procedure.74 [For **715
years**]{.underline}, our English and American ancestors understood and
acted legisla- tively (i.e., positively) to affirm the centrality of
trial by jury. Most important for my purposes is that Justice
Sutherland's opinion in the Patton case raises the specter of the
"waiveability" of rights. That is, in the 81st paragraph of the Patton
opinion, Justice Sutherland attempts to simultaneously articulate the
nation's commitment to trial by jury in criminal cases while claiming
that defendants have the right to waive their jury trial rights: Not
only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury
be jealously preserved, but [the maintenance of the jury as a
fact-finding body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a
place in our traditions, that, before any waiver can become effective,
the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be
had, in addi- tion to the express and intelligent consent of the
defendant]{.underline}. Important, [the concept of waiveability does not
appear in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights]{.underline}. But as we
saw in Chapter 1, the Patton opinion and the language applied by Justice
Sutherland to justify the constitutionality of waiving rights will
appear in the 1970 case, Brady v. United States.75 It is the Brady case
that constitutionalizes plea bargaining procedure. In the following
sections of this chapter, I will introduce the origins of trial by jury,
along with its natural law justification. A few questions guide this
inquiry. First, why was trial by jury considered so essential in
England, the colonies, by both the Federalists and Anti-Federalists, and
to the framers of the Constitution? Second, what are rights and why are
they important? What is the difference between a right and a privilege?
Are there rights so essential to the legitimate functioning of a
republic that they may not be waivable? What, if any, are the arguments
stemming from a commitment to personal autonomy and efficiency that
provide justification for rights waiv- ers? Do rights pertain solely to
a subject, or are they held by the people in common, or both? How are
they affected by the liberty of contract doctrine? Does the
constitutional permission to waive the right to trial by jury through
administration of a plea bargain pose a threat to our republic? As we
make our way through these questions, perhaps the reader can consider
the magnitude of power constituting prosecutorial authority and whether,
as it relates to plea bargains, appropriate checks on that power exist
as a procedural matter. It will come as no surprise that, in my esti-
mation appropriate checks on prosecutorial power are far too few and too
weak, especially given the constraints imposed by Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure Rule 11, which prohibit judges from knowing the facts
of the case under consideration, thereby having to rely solely upon the
prosecutor's, and to a lesser extent the defense attorney's, intent. A
Brief History of the Jury Trial

#### Natural law implies unconditional, un-commodifiable and principles of rights, meaning plea bargaining is antithetical to the common good and universal law

Natural Law and the Centrality of Rights In this final section of
Chapter 4, I want to briefly introduce natural law principles in a more
formal way to properly contextualize the meaning of rights. This is
important because it is my contention that Article III §2, and the Sixth
Amendment providing for the right to trial by jury in all criminal
cases, signify positive rights that help to ensure transparency in the
admin- istration of justice. I also find myself in agreement with our
ancestors that trial by jury serves to provide a common law check on
executive, legislative, and judicial authority, while serving to educate
Americans on the rightful application and centrality of the rule of law
in our republic. Natural Law Natural law has inspired the juridical
organization of Western civilizations at least as far back as ancient
Greece. [[Natural law]{.mark} jurisprudence is guided by the belief that
"there are objective moral principles which can be discovered by
reason]{.underline}."110 The presumption is that [there are [moral
truths]{.mark} that [transcend time and culture]{.mark}, and it is these
truths that ought to [form the **foundation of
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Professor Finnis, the most recognized
20th-century natural law the- orist, the basic forms of [good are: life,
knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability, practical
reasonableness, and religion]{.underline}.111 [Each of these goods can
only be realized in "a community of human beings for only in communal
life are there conditions for the pursuit of basic
goods]{.underline}."112 Seeking to avoid ancient references to the "will
of God," Finnis seeks guidance from Aristotle and Aquinas. For him, "the
normative conclusions of natural law are not based on the observation of
human or any other nature but rather on a reflective grasp of what is
self-evidently good for human beings."113 Finnis's list of seven goods
is, in his view, self-evident goods, goods that are mani- fested across
all cultures. What follows is a brief introduction to a few of the
essential natural law philosophers, namely, Cicero, Aquinas, Locke,
Blackstone, Kant, and Finnis. This is by no means presented as
exhaustive of the complexity of their work, but rather is provided here
solely as a way to realize through their own words the similarity of
emphasis upon the categorical impera- tive (Kant), that just law is
moral law, and that all [[law must be]{.mark} [**equitably** shared by
the **common** in order]{.mark} for human beings [to attain]{.mark}
Finnis's basic forms of [a good life]{.mark}]{.underline} (see above),
[[and for there to be]{.mark} criminal [legal]{.mark}
systemic]{.underline} **[[legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It was the
Roman Cicero (106--43 BC), likely influenced by the Stoics, who
generated the most widely recognized expression of the principles of
natural law. [[True law is]{.mark} right reason in agreement with
nature; it is of [**universal** appli- cation]{.mark}, **unchanging**
and **everlasting**; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts from
wrongdoing by its prohibitions]{.underline}. And [it does not lay its
commands or prohibitions upon good men in vain]{.underline}, though
neither have any effect on the wicked. [[It is a sin]{.mark} to try to
alter this law, nor is it allow- able to attempt to [repeal any]{.mark}
[part of it]{.mark}, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. [We
cannot be freed from its obligations]{.mark}]{.underline} by senate or
people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or
interpreter of it. And [[there will not be different laws at Rome and at
Athens]{.mark}, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal
and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all
times]{.underline}, and there will be one master and ruler, that is,
God, over us all, for he is the author if this law, its promulgator, and
its enforcing judge.114 Most relevant in this passage is Cicero's
advancement of the morality of law. Since law was inspired by the Gods
and comprehensible to Homo sapiens through the application of right
reason, all unjust laws must in fact not be considered genuine law. This
is because "[for Cicero moral purpose was an essential feature of
law]{.underline}."115 The most historically influential of the natural
law philosophers is Thomas Aquinas (1225--1274). Unlike Cicero, who
expressed a thesis of divine law settled once and for all, Aquinas's
articulation of natural law was far more nuanced. For starters, Aquinas
understood that there could be a distinction made between the divine and
the human as manifested in law. For example, "Aquinas's basic arguments
about the nature of law, and about [the rela- tion of law with morality,
are not dependent on particular views about the sources or substantive
content of that morality]{.underline}. If there can be a secular
morality antecedent to human laws and concrete institutions, the basic
principles of the natural law tradition can be considered even apart
from their location within the traditions of Catholic theology."116
Application of the Thomist expression of natural law to human law
requires us to assess the moral reasons for adopting and applying that
law. This is because "the natural law tradition has always argued that
[human]{.underline} '[[positive' law derives its moral authority]{.mark}
\[and, I might add, systemic legitimacy\] [from]{.mark} its deriva- tion
from principles of]{.underline} (God-given) [[natural
law]{.underline}]{.mark}."117 From Aquinas's Summa Theologica, we
receive the following: Thus, ... [Law is nothing else than an ordinance
of reason for the common good, promulgated by him who has the care of
the community]{.underline}. Just as in the speculative reason, from
naturally known indemonstrable principles we draw the conclusions of the
various sciences, the knowledge of which is not imparted to us by
nature, but acquired by the efforts of reason, so too it is that from
the precepts of the natural law, as from com- mon and indemonstrable
principles, the human reason needs to proceed to the more particular
determination of certain matters. These particular determinations,
devised by human reason, are called laws. [The force of a law depends on
the extent of its justice]{.underline}. Now in human affairs a thing is
said to be just from being right, according to the rule of reason. 118
It was the "higher law" tradition inspired by John Locke119 that was
influ- ential upon the framers of the Constitution. This higher law
tradition, flow- ing as it does from Aquinas, pressed the importance of
moral foundations for just law. In his statement relating to the state
of nature, [[Locke]{.underline}]{.mark} directly [[references our
**collective responsibility**]{.mark} [to each other in preservation of
the common good]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like Rousseau, Locke provided a
theory of the social con- tract, one that would preserve personal
property rights. As it pertains to our concern in this chapter --
whether a subject should be free to relinquish rights -- Locke's
response oozes with natural law principles consistent with the promotion
of moral law. But though [[this be a state of liberty]{.underline}, [yet
it is not a state of licence]{.underline}]{.mark} (sic): though man in
that state have an uncontroulable (sic) liberty to dispose of his person
or possessions, yet [[he has not liberty to destroy
himself]{.underline}]{.mark}, or so much as any creature in his
possession, [[but]{.underline} [where some nobler
use]{.underline}]{.mark} [[than its bare preservation calls for
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The state of nature has a law of nature to
govern it, which obliges every one]{.underline}: and reason, which is
that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all
equal and independent, not one ought to harm another in his life,
health, lib- erty, or possessions: for men being all the workmanship of
one omnipo- tent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one
sovereign master, sent into the world by his order, and about his
business; they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to
last during his, not one another's pleasure: and being furnished with
like faculties, share all in one community of nature, there cannot be
supposed any such subordi- nation among us, that may authorize us to
destroy one another, as if we were made for another's uses, as the
inferior ranks of creatures are for our's.120 From Locke, we are able to
discern vaguely referenced natural law principles that influenced the
framers of the American Constitution, but not in the way that historians
have traditionally interpreted it. Specifically, the framers were far
more influenced by Locke's emphasis upon the protection of individual
liberty (especially to procure and retain property) and his well-known
artic- ulation of the right to rebel against an oppressive sovereign
ruler.121 Locke writes directly about mutual obligation to adhere to
natural law through the application of reason. He emphasizes that human
beings have no right to extinguish their lives or hurt others since we
are all products of the divine, each deserving of respect.122 Finally,
like the Greek and Roman philosophers, and Thomas Aquinas, Locke
situates the administration of just law within the context of the common
good. Following Edelstein, "Locke offered a way to step back from
English constitutionalism and discuss the foundation and origins of all
governments. In this regard, while his own account of rights was
something of an obstacle, Locke helped the colonists frame their consti-
tutional rights within a broader theory of government."123

In addition to an American revisionist interpretation of John Locke's
First and Second Treatises of Government,124 English jurist and
cataloger of com- mon law, William Blackstone (1723--1780), was familiar
to and influential over the founding generation of Americans. Blackstone
was committed to the argument that for law to be just, it must be moral.
An immoral law was no valid law at all (this view was originally
articulated by Augustine). For Blackstone, as with all advocates of
natural law, "once it becomes clear that things like constitutions and
statutes and regulations and court cases are but the realization of a
higher law, then it is a mistake not only when statutes enacted by
fallible human beings try to enforce what is not moral, but also when
they fail to enforce what is moral."125 In his Groundwork of the
Metaphysics of Morals, Immanuel Kant (1724--1804) applies a methodology
that identifies three unique historical periods leading to the
transition from common cognition to philosophical moral rational
cognition.126 It is in this work that Kant presents us with themes that
in time would come to encompass much of the Western con- sideration of
morality and law, especially as applied to the evolution of and support
for human rights law.127 For example, [Kant argues that "every human
being is an end in himself or herself, not to be used as a mere means by
others; that respect for your own humanity finds its fullest expression
in respect for that of others; and that morality is freedom, and evil a
form of enslavement]{.underline}."128 For our purposes I wish to
emphasize [[the Kantian com- mitment]{.underline}]{.mark} to viewing all
human beings as ends in themselves, one consistent with natural law
principles, that [enables states to [generate laws consistent
with]{.mark} the moral dictates of [human thriving]{.mark}. For Kant, "a
human being and generally every rational being exists as an end in
itself, not merely as a means for the discretionary use of this or that
will]{.underline} \[[a critique of utilitarian- ism\], but must in all
its actions, whether directed towards itself or also to other rational
beings, always be considered at the same time as an
end]{.underline}."129 With regard to the duty to act consistently with
the categorical imperative of universal practical reason, Kant declares
that [[consciousness of our col- lective humanity is antecedent to
experience; it is]{.mark} an [innate]{.mark} [feature]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} our practical [reason]{.mark}. [the ground]{.mark} of all
practical legislation [lies]{.mark} objectively [in]{.mark} [the
rule]{.mark} and the form [of universality]{.mark}, [which]{.mark}
(according to the first principle) [makes it capable of being a
law]{.mark} (or perhaps a law of nature),]{.underline} subjectively,
however, in the end; [the subject of all ends]{.underline}, however, is
every rational being, as an end in itself ...: from this now follows the
third principle of the will, as the supreme condition of its harmony
with universal practical reason, the idea of the will of [every rational
being as a universally legislating will]{.underline}.130 Finally, and
with due recognition that this presentation of Kant's theory is woefully
simplistic but is presented here for his emphasis upon the collective
duty to commit to moral law, Kant argues that a [human will "universally
legislating through all its maxims" is suited to the categorical
imperative so long as "it is founded on no interest and can thus alone,
among all possible imper- atives, be unconditional; or better still, by
converting the proposition, if there is a categorical imperative (i.e.,
a law for every will of a rational being), then it can only command to
do everything from the maxim of one's will as one that could at the same
time have as its object itself as universally
legislating]{.underline}.131 To summarize, for Kant certain [maxims
generating freedom may be uncov- ered through practical reason. Inasmuch
as these maxims are fundamental to human beings regardless of their
cultural experiences, [adhering to leg- islative initiatives seeking to
promote collective well-being is a categorical
imperative]{.mark}]{.underline}; [a responsibility that each human being
has to themselves and to each other]{.underline}. I present Kant's work
here because he extends the depth of our understanding of natural law,
human will, and duty to obey categorical imperatives given their
ubiquitous constitution of the human experience. It is my contention
that [[the trial by jury]{.underline}]{.mark}, [commonly held by our
English and]{.underline} early [colonial]{.underline}
[American]{.underline} [ancestors]{.underline}, [[appeared]{.mark} [as
a]{.mark} categorical imperative]{.underline}, [a [**duty** of every
member]{.mark} of the commons [to see to it]{.mark} that [laws be
properly administered]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} that [the authority to
create]{.mark} and administer [law was]{.mark} suf- ficiently [balanced
by]{.mark} common law [commitments to justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
[the trial by [jury was established]{.mark}]{.underline} by no specific
private or public interest seeking to gain power for themselves or
others like them, but rather, [[as a procedural check
on]{.underline}]{.mark} expressions of [[irrational authority]{.mark}
[impeding]{.mark} the realization of [freedom]{.mark}, the trial by jury
appears to meet Kant's definition of a categorical impera-
tive]{.underline}. Service is to rational universal legislation
determined through practical reason and grounded upon a commitment to
human will, duty, and mutual respect. The final natural law theorist
that I will present has already been intro- duced, John Finnis.
Originally published in 1979, in Natural Law & Natural Rights Finnis
articulated a contemporary vision for natural law attorneys and legal
scholars. Finnis draws his inspiration from Aristotle and Aquinas, and
as such has produced a more nuanced vision of natural law than the car-
icatures of natural law produced by positive law theorists beginning in
the 18th century with Jeremy Bentham's caustic quip that natural law was
"non- sense on stilts." As with Aristotle and Aquinas, Finnis contends
that [human beings possess an innate sense of the common
good]{.underline}. In direct response to 20th-century positivists,
Finnis argues, consistent with the position I have taken in this book
thus far, that [[If one could]{.mark} [ever rightly choose]{.mark} [a
**single** act]{.mark} which itself damages and itself does not promote
some basic good, then [one could]{.mark} [rightly]{.mark}
[choose]{.mark} [whole]{.mark} programmes and [institutions]{.mark} and
enterprises [that]{.mark} themselves damage and [do not promote]{.mark}
basic aspects of human [well-being, for the sake of]{.mark} their "net
[beneficial]{.mark} [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}."132 And as if
referring directly to the imposition of the plea bargaining procedure,
[It only remains to note that if one thinks that one's rational
responsibility to be always doing and pursuing good is satisfied by a
commitment to act always for best [consequences]{.mark}, one [treats
every aspect of human personal- ity]{.mark} (and indeed, therefore,
treats oneself) [as a utensil]{.mark}. [One holds oneself ready to do
anything]{.mark} ([and]{.mark} thus [makes oneself a tool for all those
willing to threaten sufficiently bad consequences if one does not
cooperate with them]{.mark}]{.underline}).133 [[**Plea bargaining** is
premised on]{.mark} systemic needs for **[efficiency]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} predict- ability, with the [consequence]{.mark} being
certainty of conviction]{.underline}[. [A subject who commits
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [authoritatively justified yet [questionable
acts that violate]{.mark} basic [human values to promote system
stability will]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Finnis, [[facili-
tate]{.mark} locomotion toward [the diminution of]{.mark} human
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because justice demands a set of
elements crucial to its realization. For Finnis, those elements are: 1)
other-directedness, one's relations and dealings with other persons; it
is "inter-subjective" or interpersonal; 2) duty of what is owed or due
to another, and correspondingly of what that other person has a right
to; and 3) equality, proportionality, or equilibrium or balance.134
Finnis con- cludes his remarks by saying that, "The requirements of
justice, then, are the concrete implications of the basic requirement of
practical reasonableness that one is to favour and foster the common
good of one's communities."135 This admittedly brief exploration of
natural law principles is meant to provide context for the final section
of this chapter, one that I have reserved for discussion until the
proper context had been established. At issue in this book is the
political economy of plea bargaining. My argument is that [[the trial by
jury signifies]{.mark} a categorical imperative, a [legal]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [so impor- tant]{.mark} to the legitimate
functioning of the criminal legal system [that without it]{.mark} [the
republic]{.mark} has [returned to]{.mark} the **[opaque]{.mark}**
administration of [justice]{.mark}]{.underline} that existed prior to
its emergence in the 14th century and was the reason for it. As we have
seen, the framers considered the right to trial by jury so important
that it is the most often presented of the rights in the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights, and it was the first right to be agreed upon at
the 1787 Constitutional Convention. We have also learned that the idea
of unalienable or inalienable rights emerged from natural law
principles, principles requiring that all law be moral and attentive to
the common good. It is from the philosophical framing of natural law
that the idea of rights emerges. This is the issue to which we now turn
our attention. Rights

#### Rights construct the subject. To bargain away your rights is self-objectifying and destroys personal dignity by decreasing your status as a subject, thereby removing your rights to commodify your rights

Defining Rights To begin, we must differentiate private from public law.
From the litera- ture referenced thus far, it should be clear that the
overriding concern for Enlightenment legal philosophers and theologians
was essentializing private subjective rights under law. This was
important because [the protection of subjective rights under positive
law demonstrated the utmost respect for human autonomy]{.underline},
especially as it manifested in the procurement and pres- ervation of
private property (Locke's primary concern). And while there is ongoing
dispute over whether claims to natural law "rights" antecedent to law
are oxymoronic since "rights" have no normative systemic existence
without reference to law (e.g., Bentham and Kelson), the idea that
[human beings as human]{.underline} [beings]{.underline} [are
constituted by pre-juridical "human rights]{.underline}" (Kant) and
that, under the preservationist regime, [those rights must be for- mally
acknowledged and protected under the color of law remains
power]{.underline}- fully animating. This is because, as New York
politician and slave trader, Philip Livingston (1716--1778), claimed,
"[Legal rights are those rights which we are entitled to by the eternal
laws of right reason; they exist independent of positive
law]{.underline}, and stand as the measure of its legitimacy."150 As
should be familiar, Livingston's reference to "right reason" conjures up
references to Aristotle, Aquinas, and Kant. These more general
references to natural law rights signify the framers' acknowledgment
that in order for positive law to operate within a natural law
framework, a clear statement of what Max Weber called an "ideal type"
must be formulated and adopted. What [rights]{.underline}, expressed at
the most general level, should be [adopted by the framers]{.underline}
and the nation and that [would be expressive of our innate natural law
rights]{.underline}? The answer: the right to life, liberty, and
property. Once articulated, as in the Preamble to the Constitution, the
framers were free to construct positive laws that more specifically led
the country toward the realization of the prin- cipled ends. It was
through the adoption of a constitution, a document that would outline
the limits of state power, that [public law served to advance the
normative interests of the common in civil society]{.underline}.
Consistent with private law, [[a]{.mark} "[right]{.mark}" is a legal
technology that in mod- ern legal theory [bestows]{.mark} [a special
status upon individuals]{.mark}, one [that]{.mark} [enables]{.mark}
"[one person to impose an obligation]{.mark} up[on]{.mark}
[another]{.mark} person]{.underline}."151 Importantly, [[the notion of
"personhood" is a]{.mark} legal **[construct]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one
that must establish its juridical meaning in opposition to public law
and the common good. As Menke makes clear, "[the modern form of rights
does not exist because there are autonomous subjects, but autonomous
[subjects exist because]{.mark} the modern form of [rights]{.mark}
[do]{.mark}es]{.underline}."152 Reminiscent of the position I took at
the opening of this chapter -- [[while a person is constituted by
subjective rights, those rights do not belong to the
subject]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Menke elaborates upon this point:
[Subjective [rights]{.mark} are modes of authorization that [confer
normative power]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[subjective
rights are subjective not because a subject has them]{.mark}, but,
precisely to the contrary, [because they produce the
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[For to be a subject means]{.mark}
precisely [to be an authority]{.mark} of capacities and oppor- tunities,
an authority of power]{.underline}. [Subjective [rights are subjective
because they subjectify]{.mark}]{.underline}.153 While private law has
as its modus operandi the equality of individuals engaged in contractual
exchanges under the protection of law, public law is guided by
constitutional principles addressing concerns of the common good. Here,
equality among individuals is not assumed. This distinction is similar
to the physiocratic emphasis upon subjective natural rights to pri- vate
property gained by way of a competitive market, with recognition that
economic instability, class position, and the cultural distribution of
skills and opportunities will invariably produce significant hardships
for many, thereby requiring an ideological and juridical commitment to
ameliorating their suffering through public law. To summarize, the
United States of America adopted a synthesis of natural rights and
positive law, where natural rights provided the ideological frame
through which positive law would operate. While popular understanding
situates John Locke as the social contract theorist of greatest
influence upon the framers' adoption of a preservationist rights regime,
as has been demon- strated, this view is incorrect; Locke articulated a
transfer of rights regime. Rather, it was the physiocrats, William
Blackstone, James Otis, and John Dickinson, among others, who would
provide the foundation for preserva- tionism in the republic. It was
Otis, though, who would reframe the framers' understanding of Locke,
especially his well-known expression of the right of people to overthrow
an oppressive sovereign, that Americans would find most appealing in
Locke's theory. [Rights signify an obligation to act]{.underline}.
Whether we are discussing private or public law, where
[rights]{.underline} exist, they do so to [provide the subject with
juridical protection]{.underline}, protection that is horizontal in the
case of private law (contractual relationships between two or more
people) and vertical in the case of public law, where there is an
acknowledgment that political, eco- nomic, and cultural resources are
inequitably distributed, and where rights administered through a system
of law should be applied to ameliorate that inequity. \*\*\* The right
to trial by a jury of 12 commences in the West in 1215 with the Magna
Carta ("The Great Charter"). It is premised upon a natural and com- mon
law articulation of the sovereignty of the people to check the power of
the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
Consistent with Kant, I contend that trial by jury, as it appears in
Article III §2 of the Constitution, and the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh
Amendments, signifies a categorical imperative grounded in public law
that was and remains neces- sary to protect the people, cloaked with
natural rights, from the authoritar- ian whims of the powerful.
Moreover, [since [natural rights may never be taken]{.mark} [from a
subject given their origin in]{.mark} human [reason and mutual
respect]{.mark}, because]{.underline} [[rights do not belong to the
subject]{.mark} (in fact, [the subject is constituted by those
rights]{.mark}), those public [rights necessary to the **preservation of
liberty**]{.mark} [for the common]{.mark} in civil society]{.underline}
[[are **not commodified**]{.mark} personal [goods that can]{.mark} [be
contracted away]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Rather, [public rights
like the right to trial by jury sig- nify an essential element for the
preservation and flourishing of our republic under law]{.underline}.

#### Plea bargaining not constitutional - power imbalances mean the choice is coerced and made under duress, nullifying it being a free contract

And does anyone take seriously the Court's reference to "rehabilita-
tive prospects"? What, exactly, did it have in mind? While the 1970s may
have been flush with rehabilitative enthusiasm, that is certainly not
the case in the second decade of the twenty-first century. While not a
plea-bargaining case, Chaffin v. Synchcome provided the Court with the
opportunity to once again emphasize, just as it had in the Brady,
Parker, and Alford line of cases, that a threat of harsher punishment in
no way infringes upon the assertion of a defendant's constitutional
rights. 131 Put another way, [discouraging defendants from exercising
their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights is not uncon-
stitutional]{.underline}. Inspired by Brady, the Chaffin Court said,
"Although every such circumstance has a discouraging effect on the
defendant's assertion of his trial rights, [the imposition of these
difficult choices was upheld as an inevitable attribute of any
legitimate system which toler- ates and encourages the negotiation of
pleas]{.underline}." 132 Here, the Chaffin majority acknowledged that
the emperor stands naked before us, but as is so often the case, threw
its hands up and simply rationalized its decision by casting it in the
shadow of the three cases preceding it. A more pernicious assertion
appears just a few paragraphs later: The criminal process, like the rest
of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring "the making of
difficult judgments" as to which course to follow. . . . [Although a
defendant may have a right]{.underline}, even [of]{.underline}
[constitutional dimensions]{.underline}, to follow whichever course he
chooses, [the Constitution does not]{.underline}, by that token, [always
forbid requiring him to choose]{.underline}. 133 Here laid before us is
the rub of this Article: [[a right is not some- thing]{.mark} that
[you]{.mark} [can negotiate away even if you want to---that would be a
privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A]{.mark} [right is]{.mark} superior
to a privilege because]{.underline}, even when we are not sophisticated
enough to fully appreciate its meaning, and for the culture as a whole,
[it [is]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[there to protect
us]{.underline}]{.mark}. [You can neither give a right away, nor can it
be taken away]{.underline}. [The Court's emphasis on [the ability to
"**choose**]{.mark}" [one's rights is **dangerous**]{.mark} in
a]{.underline} [democracy as [it **erodes** the **protective web**
necessary for the realization]{.mark} [of personhood under
law]{.mark}]{.underline}. The decade of the 1970s closed with two
decisions---Corbitt v. New Jersey134 and Bordenkircher v. Hayes.135 In
Corbitt, the Court reaf- firmed its decisions in Brady, Parker, and
Alford---that the threat of an enhanced sentence if convicted at trial
would not constitute a viola- tion of the defendant's Fifth, Sixth, and
Fourteenth Amendment rights.136 But it was the Court's 5--4 decision in
Bordenkircher137 that produced the most dramatic effect on post-Brady
plea jurisprudence. As with nearly all the preceding plea cases, at
issue was the question of voluntariness. 138 Defendant Hayes, charged
with producing a forged document, faced between two and ten years in
prison. 139 The prosecutor offered him five years pursuant to a plea.
140 If the defen- dant rejected the plea, the prosecutor threatened to
charge him as a habitual offender, which carried a life sentence. 141
Hayes rejected the plea offer and was convicted at trial where he was
sentenced to life in prison.142 The Supreme Court decided that, in
holding out the likeli- hood of enhanced charge and sentence if
convicted at trial, the prose- cutor had not acted inappropriately. 143
Citing Blackledge, the Court retreated to existing plea practice to
rationalize its decision: "Whatever might be the situation in an ideal
world, the fact is that the guilty plea and the often concomitant plea
bargain are important com- ponents of this country's criminal justice
system." 144 Once again af- firming the contractual nature of the plea,
the Court stated: To punish a person because he has done what the law
plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic
sort. . . . But in the "give-and-take" of plea bargaining there is no
such element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free
to accept or reject the prosecution's offer. 145 Continuing, the Court
addressed the voluntariness inherent in the plea with a tortured and
failed logic: "Indeed, acceptance of the basic legitimacy of plea
bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any no- tion that a guilty
plea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the
end result of the bargaining process."146 As with nearly all of its
1970s plea jurisprudence, the Court "doth protests too much, me thinks."
147 Of course, it is the constitutionality of plea-bargaining that is at
issue and, through explication of the 1970s case law regarding pleas, it
is clear that the Court struggles to balance the structural demands
facing prosecutors (increased caseload, re- source pressures) with what
appears to be the authoritative promulga- tion of trial rights appearing
in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The Court hypothesizes that when
pleas are knowingly and voluntarily en- tered, they do not violate the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments. This ap- peal to argumentum ad ignorantiam
is a fallacy of formal logic. It presents the proposition as true
because it has not yet been proven false. Thus, the Court assumes what
must be proven, which is the is- sue that all Court decisions before the
1970s had severely criticized. In the excerpted paragraph immediately
above, [[the]{.mark} [Court]{.mark} also re-em- phasizes the contractual
nature of the plea bargain, [refusing to view]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
resulting "[deal" as unconstitutional since it was the product of
a]{.mark} legally binding [contract]{.mark}]{.underline}. But in what is
perhaps the Court's most bra- zen affront to the Bill of Rights, it
stripped away the veneer of consti- tutionality to explain: "It follows
that, [by tolerating and encouraging the negotiation of pleas, [this
Court]{.mark} has necessarily [accepted]{.mark} as consti- tutionally
legitimate the simple reality that [the prosecutor's interest]{.mark} at
the bargaining table [is to persuade the]{.mark} [defendant to forego
his right]{.mark} to plead not guilty]{.underline}." 148 As a party to
the adversarial system and one whom is facing serious structural
pressures to quickly resolve cases, this would be an under- standable
admission emanating from a prosecutor. But for the Su- preme Court to
articulate it is simply astonishing. For [what the Court admits to,
takes it far afield from the statement of prosecutorial
ethics]{.underline} outlined in Berger v. United States, where Justice
Sutherland delivered the opinion of the Court.149 [Through its
affirmation of [prosecutorial pressure]{.mark} to induce a plea by
dissuading defendants from exercising their right to trial, the
Bordenkircher Court lost all perspective, and in doing so, it recklessly
[**disfigured** the balance]{.mark} [of power in]{.mark} adversarial
[due process]{.mark}]{.underline}. The decade of the 1970s ended with
the constitutionality of plea- bargaining firmly in place as the Supreme
Court met legal challenges to the voluntariness of the plea with
indifference. Moreover, [the Court had taken to referring to the
plea-bargaining process in the terms of contract law]{.underline}. While
not fully formed, it was clear that [[the Court treated]{.mark} the
resolution of criminal cases via [plea negotiations]{.mark} [as]{.mark}
similar to two [equitable]{.mark} parties engaging each other at the
[bargaining]{.mark} table]{.underline}. [This would have
deleterious]{.underline} [consequences]{.underline} for subsequent chal-
lenges to plea-bargaining as [violating the doctrine of unconstitutional
conditions]{.underline}. Since the decade of the 1970s, there have been
a few landmark cases. In 1995, in United States v. Mezzanatto, the
Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of plea waivers where the
waiver per- tained to the ability of the state to use inculpatory
statements made during plea negotiations at trial. 150 In 2002 in United
States v. Ruiz, the Supreme Court returned to its 1970s enhancement of
prosecutorial authority in plea negotiations by deciding that there is
no constitutional requirement for the state to disclose impeachment
evidence prior to entering into a plea negotiation. 151 Most recently,
on the same day in March of 2012, the Supreme Court rendered two
decisions that caught many court watchers by surprise. In Missouri v.
Frye and Lafler v. Cooper, the Court held that defendants have a right
to effective assistance of counsel in plea settings. 152 These decisions
are remarkable because, while they signify the first time that the Su-
preme Court acknowledges the right to competent counsel for defend- ants
engaging in a plea bargain, they do not pave the way for changes to
plea-bargaining more generally.153 In fact, Alschuler refers to the two
decisions as "Two Small Band-Aids for a Festering Wound." 154 This brief
historical time-line indicates that [for most of [the]{.mark} Supreme
[Court]{.mark}'s history, while never suggesting that plea-bargaining
was ille- gal, it [remained suspicious]{.mark} and concerned
[about]{.mark} [the extent]{.mark} to which the [plea]{.mark} setting
[induced **coerced confessions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That all changed
begin- ning in 1970 with the Court's inspissated interpretations of the
Fifth Amendment and the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. There
are exceedingly plausible, though unsatisfactory, explanations as to why
in the next Section. 155 IV. THE D OCTRINE OF U NCONSTITUTIONAL C
ONDITIONS AND P LEA W AIVERS

#### Constitutional law is based on due process, not contract law. Contract law citizenship means that unconstitutional conditions can be applied in any contract with the state, meaning all rights are conditional and can be de facto abolished via duress

It is at this point that the Author must return to Justice Sutherland's
1930 decision in Patton v. United States, as it is an important
deviation from Thompson v. Utah and all previous settled law on the
issue of rights waivers. 247 As previously established, the influence of
liberal economic theory postulated citizens as "free agents" who were
able to buy and sell their rights consistent with perceived benefits.
This con- tract model of rights was at odds with historical precedent
but pro- vided a powerful ideological device necessary to remedy
systemic challenges facing the administration of high caseloads. The
courts viewed plea waivers not as a usurpation of constitutional
protections, but as a way to enhance efficiency. Criminal defendants
were "free" to choose the path that most suited their interests as
manifested in a set of prosecutorial offers and an assessment of the
risk of conviction at trial. 248 But is this constitutionally
permissible? The literature ad- dressing unconstitutional conditions and
rights waivers is dense and controversial.249 However, at the risk of
marginalizing the contention that plea-bargaining is unconstitutional,
the Author wants to provide at least a modest [critique]{.underline} of
[the]{.underline} liberal-economic [framing of homo
economicus]{.underline} and the Randian250 notion [that]{.underline}
American [citizens engage the state as individuals (free thinking, free
acting, reasonable, ra- tional) who are fully self-contained, autonomous
units that are "free" to engage state authority in a bargaining
transaction]{.underline} as if (a) homo economicus possessed equitable
power and authority and (b) homo economicus was possessive of the
authority as a self-contained bearer of rights to negotiate those away.
251 As demonstrated below, neither is the case. The Constitution is a
law. 252 As such, neither the state nor any other public or private
institution may alter the law; that can only be done through the consent
of the people. 253 The Constitution does permit the government to place
conditions on benefits, but it also re- quires the consent of the
governed to do so. [Conditions constituting [plea negotiations]{.mark}
**[distort]{.mark}** the meaning of [consent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
his 1918 opinion for a unanimous Court in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Public
Service Com- mission of Missouri, Justice Holmes made clear [the Court's
concerns that **[consent through coercion]{.mark}** [registers an
**impermissible** and **uncon- stitutional** **condition**]{.mark} on a
benefit]{.underline}. Justice Holmes stated: [[Were it
otherwise]{.mark}, as conduct under duress involves a choice, [it al-
ways would be possible]{.mark} for a State [to impose an]{.mark}
[unconstitutional burden by the threat of penalties]{.mark} worse than
it in case of a failure to accept it, [and then]{.mark} to [declare the
acceptance voluntary]{.mark}]{.underline}, as was at- tempted in
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. O'Connor. On the facts we can
have no doubt that the application for a certificate and the acceptance
of it were made under duress. . . . [It always is for the interest of
the party under duress to choose the lesser of two evils. But [the fact
that a choice was made according to interest does not exclude
duress]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is the characteristic of duress properly
so called.254 The constitutional presumption of consent was of "the
governed" as a whole, especially when regarding a matter of fundamental
rights. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the buckled, Alice in
Wonderland, hegemonic philosophy of consent that permeated liberal,
economic jurisprudence beginning in the early 1900s, [[consent came to
be]{.mark} [synonymous]{.mark} [with]{.mark} one lone defen- dant
engaging the state in [the **marketplace of rights
trading**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an ideo- logical position that was
firmly ensconced in plea jurisprudence following Brady v. United States
in 1970. [When the government offers a charge or sentencing reduction in
exchange for (meaning with the "consent" of the defendant) the
abdication of Fifth and Sixth Amend- ment protections, it does so in
violation of the Constitution]{.underline}. [[Consent under these
circumstances confers a power to the government]{.mark} that [the
Constitution denies]{.mark} to [it]{.mark}]{.underline}. 255 Justice
Harlan, in Thompson v. Utah, and Justice Sutherland, in Frost v.
Railroad Commission of California, as- serted a similar sentiment about
the common law, that [the govern- ment "may not impose conditions which
require the relinquishment of constitutional rights]{.underline}." 256
While the facts of Frost pertain to the right of the Frost brothers to
use state roadways to carry goods, the princi- ple guiding Justice
Sutherland's opinion is apropos of pleas: Having regard to form alone,
the act here is an offer to the private carrier of a privilege, which
the state may grant or deny, upon a condition, which the carrier is free
to accept or reject. In reality, [the carrier is given no
choice]{.underline}, except between the rock and the whirl- pool,---[an
option to forego a privilege which may be vital to his live- lihood or
submit to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable
burden]{.underline}. [It would be a palpable **incongruity** to strike
down an act of state legislation which]{.underline}, by words of express
divestment, [seeks to strip the citizen of rights guaranteed by the
federal constitution, but to up- hold an act by which the same result is
accomplished under the guise of a surrender of a right in exchange for a
valuable privilege which the state threatens otherwise to withhold
.]{.underline} . . . But the power of the state in that respect is not
unlimited; and one of the limita- tions is that it may not impose
conditions which required the relin- quishment of constitutional rights.
[[If the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as a
condition]{.mark} of its favor]{.underline}, [[it
may]{.underline}]{.mark}, in like manner, [[compel the **surrender of
all**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is inconceivable that
[[guarantees]{.mark} embedded in the Constitution of the United States
[may]{.mark} thus [be **manipulated out of**
**existence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 257 Forgetting for a moment that it
was this same Justice Sutherland who, only four years later (in 1930),
would author the precedent-set- ting majority opinion in Patton v.
United States, an opinion that set the foundation for all subsequent
state claims legitimating the constitu- tionality of plea-bargaining by
adopting the "defendant as free agent capable of bargaining away
individual constitutional rights for pur- poses of expediency" principle
of due process, his antecedent reason- ing in Frost demonstrates what
was known and accepted at common law and in the Articles of
Confederation, the Declaration of Indepen- dence, the Constitution, the
Bill of Rights, the opinions of the federal courts, the state and
federal legislatures, and among legal philoso- phers up to that time.
Simply put, [the state could not condition a privi- lege on the
abdication of a constitutional right]{.underline}. Or as Justice Holmes
would have it, [presentation of [a condition]{.mark} on a constitutional
right [would amount to duress and]{.mark} would necessarily
**[force]{.mark}** a defendant into [choosing]{.mark} from among [the
"**lesser of two evils**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Still, the juxtaposition
of the Frost and Patton opinions is hard to ignore, especially since
Justice Sutherland's about-face in Patton fore- tells what would become
an all too frequent occurrence at the Su- preme Court starting in the
1970s---intellectual dishonesty for purposes of political and
institutional expediency. It is worth returning to United States v.
Vanderwerff, the recently decided by the United States District Court
for the District of Colo- rado opinion where Judge Kane bookends the
early nineteenth-cen- tury opinions referenced above with his own
statement regarding the dubious legality of pleas. 258 Mr. Vanderwerff
was charged with three counts of receiving and possessing child
pornography. 259 During plea negotiations, he agreed to plead guilty to
Count 2, and the state agreed to dismiss Counts 1 and 3. 260 However,
"the proposed plea agreement contained a waiver of Mr. Vanderwerff's
statutory right to appeal any matter in connection with his
prosecution." 261 It was the matter of the appellate waiver that was in
dispute before Judge Kane.262 But as is clear from his opinion, he
contextualizes the appel- late waiver issue in the broader framework of
the "dubious" constitu- tionality of plea-bargaining before narrowing
his focus to the matter before the court.263 [Prioritizing efficiency at
the expense of the individual exercise of constitutional rights applies
to the guilty and the innocent alike, and sacrificing constitutional
rights on the altar of efficiency is of dubi- ous legality]{.underline}
. . . . [A rational defendant, even if innocent, may plead guilty to a
lesser offense in order to minimize the risk of
prosecution]{.underline}.264 He then narrowed his focus to specific
reference to appellate waivers: "[Indiscriminate acceptance]{.underline}
of appellate waivers [undermines the abil- ity of appellate courts to
ensure the constitutional validity of convic- tions and to maintain
consistency and reasonableness in sentencing decisions]{.underline}."265
There are two remaining problems regarding the presumption of consent:
(a) the government cannot rely on consent to do what it can- not legally
do and (b) [[the government relies on]{.mark} the use of [force to
generate the consent]{.mark} that it needs to do what it legally cannot
do]{.underline}. 266 With regard to the former, by definition,
[requiring defendants to sign [plea]{.mark} waivers as a condition on a
benefit]{.underline}, like the right to appeal sup- pression motions,
267 unfair sentences,268 or the withholding of excul- patory evidence,
[[manifests as a]{.mark} powerful government [**manipulation**
of]{.mark} the [adjudication]{.mark} process [through]{.mark} an
apparent [procurement of consent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Once again,
[[supporters]{.underline}]{.mark} of waivers rely upon established
principles of contract law to legitimate the constitutionality of plea
waivers. In par- ticular, plea waivers are viewed as a mutually
beneficial agreement. 269 Constituting [case]{.underline}
[law]{.underline} in this area [is the [assumption]{.mark} that [only
contract law, not criminal due]{.mark} [process, can assure]{.mark} an
equitable and fair out- come based on principles of free and unfettered
[negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as is consistent with liberal
economic assumptions about homo economicus, [to limit the opportunity
for a defendant to lay claim to a benefit would be to limit that
defendant's freedom to bargain]{.underline}. 270 Con- trary to Judge
Kane's framing of plea waiver's in Vanderwerff, in United States v.
Wenger,271 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals vali- dated plea waivers
by suggesting that (a) defendants benefit when they are given the choice
to negotiate their charge and sentence and (b) eliminating plea waivers
would jeopardize the entire plea pro- cess.272 In general, however, the
federal courts of appeal are striking often disparate positions with
regard to plea waivers making any ref- erence to uniformity of opinion
moot. 273 For example, both United States v. Raynor and People v. Butler
hold that appeal waivers are per se invalid because "the waivers violate
due process, conflict with the public interest, and cannot comport with
contract law require- ments."274 At least [one court]{.underline} has
[held]{.underline} that plea [[waivers are unconsti- tutional]{.mark}
and violate the principles of contract law [because]{.mark} it is
apparent that the [two parties to the bargain are **in no way equals**
and the waiver **cannot be knowing and voluntary**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
275 In addition, to [threaten defendants with harsher punishment if con-
victed at trial ([the trial tax]{.mark}) [is tantamount to]{.mark} a use
of legal [force]{.mark} [that by no measure]{.mark} of reasoned
consideration [can be viewed as "consen- sual]{.mark}]{.underline}."
Because [the conditions on benefits in plea settings rely upon a
**distorted**]{.underline} and, in the Author's view, intellectually
dishonest [interpreta- tion of consent by **ignoring the power**
**imbalances**]{.underline} existing between defendants and prosecutors,
[and because of the force that is available to prosecutors to severely
restrict or eliminate liberty, plea-bargaining amounts to an
unconstitutional condition]{.underline} that violates the Bill of
Rights. 276 Specifically, "\[i\]t therefore is crucial that the role of
con- sent as a mechanism within the government's authority should not
ob- scure the problem of whether consent can cure what the government
does outside its constitutional authority." 277 [Defenders]{.underline}
of the consti- tutionality of plea-bargaining build their support upon a
house of cards by [conflating defendant's consent of rights waivers as a
prophy- lactic for constitutional violations]{.underline}. [As long as
there is consent, then there is no need to be concerned about the
usurpation of rights and subsequent liberty restrictions]{.underline}.
To reiterate a point made earlier but in a different context,
pre-political constitutional rights serve not as the sole possession of
homo economicus, but as "spheres of freedom legislated by the people as
legal limits on government."278 [[Limitations on]{.mark} assertion of
[government]{.mark} [authority reside in]{.mark} the domain of legis-
lated [legal constraints]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} [contract]{.mark}ual
relationships]{.underline}. 279 VI. CONCLUSION In a July 5, 1852 speech
delivered to the Rochester Ladies' Anti- Slavery Society, Frederick
Douglas said, "America is false to its past, false to its present, and
solemnly binds herself to be false in the fu- ture." 280 Douglas was
obviously speaking about the blemish of slav- ery, but he might as well
have been addressing plea-bargaining. The Author initiated this Article
with a reference to the well-worn fable made famous by Hans Christian
Andersen. The Author sug- gested that it was absolutely crystalline that
the system of [plea-bar- gaining in the United States appears nakedly
before us as an institutional mechanism for enhancing an out-of-control
criminal-jus- tice system.]{.underline} In order to establish plea
practice as constitutional, [[the]{.mark} Supreme [Court]{.mark} was
forced to employ a juridic [discourse]{.mark} that [shifted]{.mark} from
the language of due process found in criminal law, especially the
protections afforded by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and toward
contract law [where defendants were]{.mark} "[free" to negotiate away
their rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. This legal maneuver is akin to the
Bush Administration's use of the term "enemy combatants" rather than
"prisoners of war" be- cause the latter would have invoked Geneva
Convention protec- tions.281 [The Supreme Court applied]{.underline}
[a]{.underline}n entirely [novel]{.underline} [standard to the
adjudication of criminal cases]{.underline}, [and it rationalized its
decision as being based on the need for efficiency]{.underline}.
Post-1970 Supreme Court decisions, as the Author revealed in Section
III, generated legitimacy for the plea system by referencing its 1970
precedent. Reasoning by circulus in propando, plea-bargaining was
considered constitutional because it existed, and it existed because it
was constitutional. Since the late 1960s, [the Court has failed to
address the constitutionality of pleas]{.underline} forthrightly
[without shifting the narrative away from due process and toward
contract law]{.underline}. The reason for this, the Author contends, is
be- cause [the Court's rationale would not bear the weight of **500**
**years** of Common Law, U.S. constitutional mandates, and opinions of
the Court extending to 1930]{.underline}. With the deftness of the
magician's slight of hand and the invocation of rhetorical deception,
[the Court disappears criminal procedure and due process afforded by the
Constitution to all who are facing the loss of liberty and in its place
returns]{.underline} an entirely new rhetorical device---[the law of
contracts]{.underline}. [Those who participate in the proliferation of
legal narrative justify- ing and rationalizing the plea
system]{.underline}, the Author argues, [are]{.underline} analo- gous to
[the vain king]{.underline} who, [naked before all observers, continued
despite what was obviously transparent to rationalize his
conviction]{.underline}. The Supreme Court, prosecutors, judges, and
even defense attorneys turn to rationalization from legitimate plea
practices. They have to because, as demonstrated in this Article,
neither our Common Law heritage, our founding documents, colonial and
state constitutions, nor Supreme Court decisions until 1930 permitted
plea waivers on constitutional grounds. Each of these federal and state
institutions turned to our founding commitment to natural law and
natural rights as constitutive of our philosophical understanding of
personhood and liberty. As demonstrated, [the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
rights were considered by most to be natural rights and, as such, were
inalienable]{.underline}. What explains this philosophical shift? It
appears that it was the need for increased efficiency with regard to
case litigation. But how did this happen? Do rights trump privileges
with regard to the administration of pleas? Or put another way, [Does
our pre-political commitment to preservation of personhood under the
law, with all its attendant quali- ties of liberty, freedom, and
security, eclipse institutional demands for efficiency]{.underline}?
Remember that until 1930 the Supreme Court issued opin- ions that
emphatically ruled in the affirmative. Starting in 1930 with Patton v.
United States, however, the Supreme Court did a dramatic about-face and
shifted the course of plea jurisprudence. 282 Why? Be- cause the
dramatic increases in criminal caseloads meant increasing demand for
prosecutorial and judicial efficiency. But there remains a
cart-and-horse problem. Why were there so many cases putting nearly
insurmountable pressures on the legal system? Where did and do they come
from? The problem of enhanced prosecution was and still is a direct
by-product of legislative decision-making. The more legislators at the
state and federal level define behaviors as criminal and in need of
prosecution, the greater the resource pressures con- fronting law
enforcement, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the courts to
investigate and adjudicate them. Is it really that simple? By saying so,
the Author is at risk at being labeled incompetent and stu- pid.
Clearly, by drawing attention to this simple fact, the Author pro-
claims that the emperor stands naked before us. There really is not any
need for plea-bargaining if there are fewer cases to litigate. How is it
that all other Common Law countries manage to get by with a plea regimen
that is the inverse of ours, and yet still manage to gener- ate quite
orderly civil society? Finally, is the Author arguing for the
elimination of plea-bargaining, or a kinder, gentler, more
constitutionally viable version of it? Realis- tically, the Author joins
Langer in calling for a directed-verdict stan- dard. 283 Increased
discovery coupled with more nuanced acknowledgement of the ways in which
human beings actually process and understand information, along with a
modified adversarial due process may ameliorate some of the more
pernicious aspects of plea- bargaining. These and a host of other
questions remain to be ex- plored, but those will have to await another
day. For now it is enough to say that, as presently implemented, [the
usurpation and direct in- ducement to gain convictions by encouraging
defendants to abdicate their inalienable rights is a threat to
personhood and liberty in the United States]{.underline} of America.

#### Abdicating rights is unjust per unconstitutional conditions and coerced contract -- you cannot give up your rights to have rights, especially not under threat of punishment. The aff causes a race to the bottom to destroy democracy removing rights' inalienable status

History is replete with examples of those who refuse to accept the
hypocritical or the unjust. 33 It is the role of the disputant, the
rebel, the clever, and the truth-seeker to unmask the Emperor. Their
dispu- tations are juxtaposed to the normative platitudes offered up by
judges, lawyers, and politicians who recycle well-worn phrases like,
"efficiency and necessity," "voluntary contract," "free will," "rational
actor," "presumption of innocence," "due process," "public policy,"
"just result," and "voluntary waiver of rights." Each concept is an
empty signifier that must be infused with meaning. 34 As a matter of
legal currency, it is the Court's responsibility to provide us with that
meaning.35 With regard to plea-bargaining, the Court has donned the
cloak of the weaver and has seen fit to provide a rationalization for
plea-bargaining that is driven by the effects of heavy case loads while
scurrilously masquerading as defenders of constitutionally protected
rights. As Justice Kennedy explained in Frye, "To note the prevalence of
plea bargaining is not to criticize it. The potential to conserve valu-
able resources and for defendants to admit their crimes and receive more
favorable terms at sentencing means that a plea agreement can benefit
both parties." 36 In both Lafler and Frye, the Supreme Court spuriously
situated plea-bargaining as an equitable contract, one where defendants
often "game the system." 37 To which Alschuler has remarked, "[[This
process]{.mark} . . . [benefits both parties]{.mark} only [in the
sense]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} [**gunman's** demand for your
money]{.mark} or your life [benefits you as well as]{.mark} [the
gunman]{.mark}]{.underline}."38 True, [[the]{.mark} fortunate
[defendant]{.mark} in a plea context [receives a]{.mark}
[benefit]{.mark}, but [only after]{.mark} having [been]{.mark}
[**threatened** with]{.mark} far [har- sher]{.mark} [punishment]{.mark}
upon prospective conviction at trial]{.underline} (a topic ad- dressed
in greater detail in Section III). [Anyone seriously suggesting that
choice exists in this context is at a minimum **naive**, and at
worst]{.underline} manifestly **[dishonest]{.underline}**. To those
critics who claim that eliminating or severely restricting
plea-bargaining would significantly reduce the benefits accruing to de-
fendants, the Author joins the staff at the University of Pennsylvania
Law Review who wrote in a Comment in November of 1968 that, Ruling out
bargained pleas, however, will not prevent the prosecu- tor from
gratuitously using his discretion to reduce indictments. Furthermore,
the real focus should be on changing the laws, not on perpetuating a
system that may erratically alleviate their effect. While in some cases
the prosecutor may be stuck with unrealistically aggravated charges not
reducible under the proposed rule, he will soon learn to make well
advised decisions about which charges to prosecute. [A system freed of
plea bargaining would eventually be more beneficial to defendants
because the constitutional rights to trial could be exercised in an
atmosphere that is in fact free]{.underline}. 39 The editors of the
Pennsylvania Law Review were barking up the same constitutional tree as
asserted in the following pages. They were correct in 1968, and their
assessment of plea-bargaining is even more prescient now. The juridical
legitimacy of plea-bargaining rests upon a house of cards. Court
decisions over the course of the last century signify a disingenuous
intellectual darting between the solid colonnades of sub- stantive and
procedural law established by the United States Constitu- tion and the
Bill of Rights. Careful not to advance too near to these pillars of due
process for fear of weakening the foundation on which plea-bargaining
rests, [the Supreme Court has seen fit to sediment a practice of
inducements through [plea offers]{.mark} that [leads to the **abdica-
tion** of]{.mark} [defendants']{.mark} [constitutional
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[At stake is the integrity of the]{.mark}
[Constitution]{.mark}, the Bill of Rights, the [Judiciary]{.mark}, the
Jury, State power [and]{.mark} hegemony, and whatever still remains of
an American sense of [personhood under the law]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is because [rights are inti- mately associated with
freedom]{.underline}. 40 According to Lakoff, human
[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, [like those expressed in the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights, [are **intimately tied**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} our
common sense of [freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. 41 [These rights are
**inalienable**. [They can neither be given away, nor can they be taken
away]{.mark}.]{.underline} Justice requires freedom. [[Only
those]{.mark} who are [free to exercise their rights]{.mark} to proper
defense [can experience]{.mark} [justice]{.mark}. [The inability to
exercise]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[rights]{.underline}]{.mark}
guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights (in criminal
matters, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments) [[leads to **atrophy**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} quite possibly the [**[practical
elimination]{.underline}** [of those rights]{.underline}]{.mark} [as
experienced]{.underline} in everyday adjudication settings. [When the
powers of the state overbear the will of its subjects, freedom no longer
exists.]{.underline} Lakoff puts it this way: "\[[A[\] threat to free
will is a threat to freedom]{.mark}, the imposition of a dangerous
worldview without public awareness. When free will itself is threatened,
that is the ultimate threat to freedom]{.underline}." 42 The institution
of [plea-bargaining is]{.underline} structured as [a **power imbal-
ance** that tests the mettle of those who succumb to it]{.underline}.
And, as the Author will demonstrate in subsequent publications on this
topic, our cognitive decision-making skills, 43 cultural capital, and
habitus, 44 posi- tion us differently relative to the authority of the
prosecutor in a plea setting, thereby threatening our free will
decision-making. Critics may contend that the preservation of free will
is precisely the point of plea-bargaining. That is, by permitting
defendants to engage in a contractual negotiation of a plea, they are at
liberty to determine their own course of action. In this scenario, the
plea-bargaining pro- cess enhances free will. However, this assumption
is incorrect. [[The]{.mark} structural [conditions]{.mark} constituting
the plea negotiation [remove any]{.mark} [semblance of neutrality and
equitable bargaining]{.mark} [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby
[making pretense to "free will" nakedly ideological]{.underline}. One
additional point is necessary. Lakoff's use of free will requires that
human be- ings are provided conditions that level the playing field
relative to those in power. Human rights do this, and they enable us to
deter- mine from within the protective web of rights the path that most
en- hances our liberty options. However, [plea-bargaining usurps those
inalienable rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights to protect the pow-
erless from the overzealous application of state power. While power
imbalances have always constituted the exercise of state
authority]{.underline},45 [[with plea-bargaining]{.mark}, [the]{.mark}
[subject]{.mark} confronting prosecutorial authority [has fewer
constitutional]{.mark} [protections than]{.mark} those who would
exercise [their right to trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[despite
pretenses to]{.mark} liberal-[economic]{.mark} notions of
[equity]{.mark} [among]{.mark}]{.underline} adversaries freely engaging
in [the [negotiation]{.mark} of a contract, **[without rights
protections]{.mark}** [a]{.mark} [defendant is]{.mark} clearly [not
"free" to]{.mark} engage prosecutors]{.underline} on equitable
adversarial grounds. As a constitu- tional matter, [the magnitude of the
plea-[bargain]{.mark}ing practice threatens American ideals of freedom
and fails to produce justice.]{.underline} This Article seeks answers to
two sets of questions: First, whether the doctrine of
[**[unconstitutional conditions]{.underline}** [should apply to
plea-bar- gaining]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, whether the Supreme
Court's rationale for the con- stitutionality of pleas, that a plea is a
contract that is constitutional if it meets the knowing and voluntary
criteria, is correct or appropriate. With regard to the first
question---those that apply to unconstitu- tional conditions---the
following questions appear germane. First, "Are the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment rights inalienable?" If they are inalienable ("unalienable" in
the Declaration of Independence), then they can neither be taken away by
the state, nor can the rights holder give them away. So in a plea-offer
context, [[no matter how attractive the inducement]{.mark} offered by
the state, a [defendant does not have the right to give away her
rights]{.mark}---they are **immutable**]{.underline}. Second, "Does the
Due Process Clause found in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend- ments
provide the procedural pathway necessary to challenge the con-
stitutionality of pleas?" The Author thinks that the answer is yes, but
getting to yes requires some work. Third, "[When a suspect engages the
state upon arrest, does the presumption of innocence
prevail]{.underline}?" It is supposed to, but [given]{.underline} what
we know about the [plea-bargaining]{.underline} process, [the Author is
not convinced]{.underline} that it does. 46 This is an ex- tremely
important question because [the prosecutor's presentment at a Grand Jury
is these days a fait accompli---it is a done deal for the
state]{.underline}.47 That means that [it is]{.underline} really [not
that difficult to obtain an in- dictment, even if the suspect is
innocent]{.underline}. The practice of [plea-bargaining]{.underline} in
the United States [has institution- alized **upside-down
justice**]{.underline}. It serves as a dubious substitute for a sys- tem
of law that was plainly established in [the Constitution]{.underline}
and Bill of Rights [to preserve **personhood** and the **balance of
power**]{.underline}. [A plea bar- gain requires the defendant to
relinquish her Fifth and Sixth Amend- ment Rights]{.underline}. 48
Following Lithwick, the Fifth Amendment was the American juridic
response to abolishing conventional inquisitorial practices in [the
Brit- ish]{.underline} Courts of the [Star]{.underline}
[Chamber]{.underline} and High Commission (1487--1641). 49 In each,
inquisition [induced **involuntary confessions** by requiring de-
fendants to testify to any and all questions put to them, practices that
often resorted to **torture** as a means of prevailing upon the
recalcitrant to speak]{.underline}. 50 Recognizing the excesses of these
courts, eighteenth-cen- tury English common law adopted the principal of
nemo tenetur seip- sum accusare, which stipulated that [no man should be
required to testify against himself]{.underline}. 51 The principal of
nemo tenetur seipsum ac- cusare was adopted by nine of the founding
colonies prior to the es- tablishment of the United States.52 [The
significance of the Fifth Amendment lies in "protecting the innocent
inarticulate defendant, who might be made to look guilty if subject to
crafty questioning from a trained inquisitor]{.underline}." 53 Given
what we know about contemporary sus- pect interviews and despite the
Supreme Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 54 it is apparent that
over the course of the last two centu- ries, but since the 1970s in
particular, [[the]{.mark} spirit and profound protec- tion afforded by
the [Fifth Amendment has been **defiled** by]{.mark} [those who value
expediency over]{.mark} protecting [personhood and]{.mark} preserving
[the bal- ance of power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For the Framers,
[trial]{.mark} by a jury comprised of one's peers [was]{.mark} **[funda-
mental]{.mark}** [to the]{.mark} formation of a [democratic
state]{.mark}]{.underline}, so much so that [it ap- pears
in]{.underline} both [the]{.underline} [Constitution]{.underline} and
the Bill of Rights. Article III of the Constitution states that, "The
Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury."
55 The [Fifth]{.underline} Amendment is important here too, since it
provides presentment to a grand jury, and due pro- cess of law. 56 The
[Sixth and Seventh]{.underline} [Amendments]{.underline} to the
Constitution further clarify Article III.57 It is pretty clear that [the
Framers viewed a trial by jury as fundamentally important with regard to
questions of fairness and equity]{.underline}. However, as discussed
below, what was clear from our founding until 1898, when Justice
Harlan's majority opinion affirmed the unconstitutionality of waiving a
jury trial, 58 would by 1930 become an anachronism. 59 III. THE P LEA

In 1837, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen penned The Em- peror's
New Clothes, based on a Spanish fable dating to the fourteenth century.
8 In The Emperor's New Clothes, Andersen tells the tale of an emperor
who was something of a dandy. 9 He loved new and ostenta- tious
garments, and he would spend countless hours fancying his like- ness
before a mirror. 10 One day, two swindlers approached the emperor with
an extraordinary offer. "\[T\]hey knew how to make the finest cloth
imaginable. Not only were the colors and the patterns extraordinarily
beautiful, but in addition, this material had the amaz- ing property
that it was to be invisible to anyone who was incompe- tent or stupid."
11 The Emperor's New Clothes transgresses time and aptly captures our
current approach to plea-bargaining. Regardless of who [the insti-
tutional actor]{.underline} is---the police officer, prosecutor,
probation officer, de- fense attorney, judge, or the United States
Supreme Court---each [participates in a **fraudulent charade**
**masquerading** as justice]{.underline}. And, as explained in this
Article, [each of these actors is responsible in varying degrees for
propping up this unworkable and unconstitutional system]{.underline},
largely [through]{.underline} a proliferation of **[intellectual
dishonesty]{.underline}**. For [[each]{.mark}, in its own way,
[senses]{.mark} that the [plea-bargaining]{.mark} process [requires
a]{.mark} firm **[suspension of disbelief]{.mark}** and a commitment [to
never]{.mark} publicly [admit]{.mark} [what is known]{.mark} [to be true
for fear of being labeled incompetent]{.mark} or stupid]{.underline}.
[[Each]{.mark} actor]{.underline} [[believes as a **matter of
faith**]{.mark} that plea-bargaining is necessarily driven]{.underline}
[by case-management, resources, and time pres- sures]{.underline}. And
while that is most certainly true, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} more
penetrating [[question relates to]{.mark} whether any of these pressures
sufficiently war- rants [**usurpation** of]{.mark} our [**personhood**
and **suppression** of]{.mark} the substantive and
procedural]{.underline} [[rights]{.mark} guaranteed by the]{.underline}
United States [Constitution]{.underline}. Colorado Federal District
Court Judge Thomas Kelly Kane addressed this question on June 28, 2012,
when he rejected a plea agreement that required the defendant to waive
his right to appeal. 12 Judge Kane de- clared: "[[Prioritizing
efficiency at the expense of]{.mark} the individual exercise of
constitutional [rights applies to the guilty and]{.mark} the [innocent
alike]{.mark}, and sacrificing constitutional rights on the **altar of
efficiency** is of **dubi- ous legality**]{.underline}." 13 Judge Kane
has exposed the Emperor. [[His opinion unveils the]{.mark} irra- tional,
unconstitutional, [utilitarian]{.mark}, substantive, and [procedural
ratio- nalizations]{.mark}]{.underline} primarily found in case law that
are called upon [to justify plea-bargaining]{.underline}. And he is not
alone. In a May 2014 interview, Man- hattan Federal Judge Jed Rakoff was
quoted as saying, "[The current \[plea\] process is **totally
different** from what the founding fathers had in mind]{.underline}." 14
Judge Rakoff proposed greater involvement of junior judges in the plea
process as a way to ameliorate prosecutorial over- reach.15 His proposal
stems from the recognition that "prosecutors armed with harsh mandatory
minimum sentences \[would be\] less able to bully defendants." 16 Under
Judge Rakoff's plan, junior judges would hear evidence and make plea
recommendations. 17 In two Supreme Court decisions from March 2012, the
Court ac- knowledged the ubiquity of pleas. 18 In Lafler v. Cooper,
Justice Ken- nedy admitted, "\[[C\]riminal justice today is for the most
part a system of pleas, not a system of trials]{.underline}." 19 And, as
Justice Scalia writing in the dissent explained, [[the]{.mark} Supreme
[Court]{.mark} has "[elevate\[d\] plea bargaining from a **necessary
evil** to a **constitutional entitlement**]{.mark}]{.underline}." 20
This Article aims to expose the imperious practice of plea-bargaining
for what it is---a cynical and intellectually dishonest institutional
remedy for an unwieldy judicial system that has knowingly rationalized
the practice to facilitate expedient resolution of ever-increasing
caseloads. [The plea system is so **distorted**]{.underline} that former
criminal defense attor- ney turned legal academic, Josh Bowers, makes
the astonishing claim [that]{.underline} "[[plea bargaining may be the
best way]{.mark} [for an innocent defendant to]{.mark} [minimize
wrongful punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}." 21 Gross systemic failure at
the point of crime-scene investigation (arrest bias), and prosecutorial
charging decisions (charge bias, dismissal aversion, trial bias), are
cou- pled with defendants' process costs (e.g., waiting, pecuniary loss,
in- convenience, and uncertainty), lead Bowers to conclude that, "\[i\]n
low-stakes cases [plea bargaining is of **near-categorical** benefit to
inno- cent defendants, because the process costs of proceeding to trial
often dwarf plea prices]{.underline}." 22 In an essay replete with
remarkable brow-fur- rowing statements, Bowers asserts, "[If [it is
normatively appropriate for the innocent to plead guilty]{.mark} in
low-stakes cases, and rational--- albeit normatively problematic for
reasons unrelated to guilt and in- nocence---for the innocent to plead
guilty in high-stakes cases, then [the system must provide]{.mark}
effective avenues for innocent defendants to plead guilty]{.underline}."
23 To which [Bowers offers "[regularization and systemic
acceptance]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
common---though neither uniform nor conventionally welcome---underground
practice: [[permitting]{.mark} innocent defendants to offer
[false]{.mark} on-the-record [admissions of guilt]{.mark}]{.underline}."
24 [Because]{.underline} [our criminal justice system is so deplorable
and injurious to the point where de- fendants' process costs outweigh
the harm accrued from taking a plea, [Bowers would rather see]{.mark}
his [innocent clients plead guilty than to ex- perience the
**degradation**, **humiliation**, and **systemic violence**]{.mark} that
would accrue [by]{.mark} seeking an acquittal at
[trial]{.mark}.]{.underline} 25 The Author finds [Bow-
ers's]{.underline} [recommendations]{.underline} to be fundamentally
flawed and an [indication of just how **desperate**]{.underline} lawyers
and legal [academics have become]{.underline}. [[Ours]{.mark} [truly is
a Sisyphean effort to render justice from]{.mark} this swelling encum-
brance characterized by systemic [expediency]{.mark}]{.underline} and
intellectual dishonesty.26 Recently an exasperated Professor Albert
Alschuler, responding to the Supreme Court's decisions in Lafler and
Frye, concluded, "Now, however, [the criminal justice system has **gone
off the** **tracks**, and the rails themselves have
disappeared]{.underline}." 27 The system has become so bro- ken
according to Alschuler that "[the time may have come for criminal
justice scholars to abandon the search for ways to make the criminal
justice system fair and principled]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
principal [mission]{.underline} today [should be to make it less
awful]{.underline}." 28 With great admiration for Alschuler (and a
thorough understanding and more than a little angst-ridden commis-
erating with his palpable discontent), so long as human beings make
decisions, they can, through reasoned argument, be influenced to make
proper decisions. In steadfastly maneuvering to create a "less awful"
criminal-justice system, we may just bump headlong into sys- temic
change. However, in order for that to happen, we will have to unearth
the tracks that have long gone missing and avoid careening into the
ever-intensifying whirlpool. 29 To that end, the Author joins Professor
Stephanos Bibas, who in response to Bowers's anguished recommendation,
said the following: [[It is]{.mark} awfully [tempting to give in to the
**punishment assembly line**]{.mark}, [to make it speedier and more
efficient and surrender any pretense of doing justice]{.mark}. But [our
conscience cannot brook that]{.mark}. We must fight; we must continue to
proclaim our commitment to exonerating the innocent]{.underline},
however inconsistent we are in pursuing that in practice. 30 [One of the
reasons for [systemic stasis is the prevalence of
**groupthink**]{.mark}; the rationalizations for it signify a strong
human ten- dency.]{.underline} Besides, plea-bargaining benefits defense
attorneys, prosecu- tors, and quite often defendants.31 But the Author
joins the late Christopher Hitchens in his contention that: It is true
that the odds in favor of stupidity or superstition or un- checked
authority seem intimidating and that vast stretches of human time have
seemingly elapsed with no successful challenge to these things. But it
is no less true that there is an ineradicable instinct to see beyond, or
through, these tyrannical conditions.32

As we saw in Chapter 1, the United States Supreme Court has firmly
estab- lished the constitutionality of criminal felony plea bargaining
premised upon the right of each autonomous defendant to bargain away
their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights protections in pursuit of a
charge and sentence reduction. So long as the plea procedure meets Rule
11 and case law guide- lines establishing the factual basis, knowing and
intelligent, and voluntary prongs, the resulting agreement, the bargain,
will be considered structurally sound and constitutional. The legal
frame presented to the defendant will manifest as "form contracting"
since, while there will be some room for charge negotiation depending
upon a host of factors generated by offices of probation and provided to
the court for review prior to issuing sentence, the substance of the
frame has already been established by local county attorney office
priorities and the legislature in each state. "**[It's Good To Be
Inefficient]{.underline}**." At [the]{.underline} [root]{.underline} of
the [justification]{.underline} for plea bargaining [is that it
is]{.underline} an [extremely]{.underline} [efficient]{.underline} way
for the courts to manage overwhelming caseloads. As we have seen, [plea
cases]{.underline} are disposed of post indictment without the resource
pressure imposed by trials. Operating in a normatively procedural way,
prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and defendants participate in an
adjudication procedure that [finds]{.underline} its [origins in the
**[economics of efficiency]{.mark}** where primary emphasis is placed
upon maxi- mizing utility through the vehicle of time management and
resource scarcity]{.underline}. [The model [is predicated upon the
factory system]{.mark} and its utilitarian applica- tion of **rigid**
[managerial oversight]{.mark}, [predictability of outcome]{.mark},
[preservation of scarce]{.mark} [resources, and]{.mark} reproduction of
[system stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. All are ostensibly laudable
goals insofar as power and control are concerned, as well as a kind of
system stability emerging from the cultural satisfaction resulting from
the conviction of a defendant for crimes committed against the
community. But what if I argue that sometimes [[the most efficacious way
is not the most efficient]{.mark} one]{.underline}? Consider the process
of knowledge production. There is, in my experience, simply no
substitute for the discipline and hard work necessary to deeply learn a
subject. Reading, writing, and arguing consti- tute an often chaotic,
non-linear process that moves through fits and starts without
necessarily producing anything resembling knowledge production. Every
adult knows that their youth-inspired life plans were so much fantasy
since life resembles bumper pool -- we direct our actions toward a
specific set of goals when we are suddenly confronted with an obstacle
requiring us to switch gears and move in a different direction. We do
this throughout our lives often without realizing it until we are much
older and can look back at the crooked path we've taken. This experience
is captured by the Yiddish expression, "Der mensch tracht, Un Gott
lacht." Man plans, and God laughs. At most universities in the United
States, students are provided with structural inducements to graduate in
the most efficient way possible. This can mean that students are
guaranteed that their tuition will not increase throughout their
four-year pursuit of a baccalaureate degree as long as they are making
progress toward completion. Of course, changing one's mind regarding
their major area of study, especially if they are a few years into its
completion, is clearly not efficient since the student is "wasting their
time" and "wasting their money." Or it may mean that promising
undergraduate students can start a graduate degree while still working
toward the com- pletion of their undergraduate degree. In some
situations, students are so motivated to graduate that they routinely
register for the maximum credit hours permitted (at our institution, it
would be 19 credit hours per semester or six courses). Isn't it a good
thing if a student can graduate a semester early? Universities are
replete with procedures like these meant to enhance the efficient
completion of a four-year degree, including the requirement that
academic departments produce "career-ready" curricula meant to prepare
students for post-baccalaureate employment. Such initiatives devalue the
Humanities and Social Sciences since they tend not to be directed at
produc- ing specific skills translatable to the contemporary labor
market (as if any academic discipline can accurately predict labor
market needs five or more years in advance). What efficiency means in
each case is the completion of the degree in as short a time as
possible, at the lowest price possible, and with skills that are
immediately translatable to the labor market. Or con- sider the
now-nationwide university and college commitment to no longer hiring
tenure-track PhD faculty, relying instead upon non-tenure-track year-
to-year contracts. It is certainly efficient from the perspective of the
univer- sity as a corporate entity since it provides annual flexibility
with regard to resources allocated for instruction. If the market
crashes, as it did in 2008, and again in March 2020 with the arrival of
COVID-19, having the flexibil- ity to fire non-tenure-track faculty
improves institutional fiscal health and flexibility. But what the move
to non-tenured faculty also does is produce less institutional
commitment from those faculty, less direct engagement with their
academic discipline, and less published research, not to mention working
under the constant threat of dismissal and being relatively deprived of
any institutional power (this is especially relevant for non-white,
female, and non-binary academics). In short, [[the most
efficient]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., [linear]{.underline}) [[path is
an]{.mark} ideological [**construct** that assumes **perfect
knowledge**]{.mark} [about alternatives and the ability to
control]{.mark} all [externalities]{.mark} that may intercede upon our
plans]{.underline}. Life is messy precisely because it is constituted by
an infinite number of subjective and objective variables replicated over
seven billion people on the planet. But perhaps the most important
reason for human beings to confront [the **neoliberal demand** for
efficiency]{.underline} is that it [fails to attend to the human need to
manage time]{.underline} in ways that are determined entirely by them,
and for the purpose of realizing their species essence. Sometimes people
do organize their lives in as efficient a way as possible given
externalities. And sometimes, as with experiences that take place in
civil society where people live most of their lives, efficiency is
unlikely to prevail. A traditional lover of baseball has no concern with
effi- ciency. Prior to the 2023 season, baseball had no time
limitations. A game would last as long as it was necessary to determine
a winner. Consistent with a more efficient management of time, Major
League Baseball introduced pitching and hitting time clocks to reduce
the amount of time per game. Prior to the changes, a typical game would
last roughly three hours. Cricket is an even less efficient game,
lasting on average seven and a half hours per day for five days. What is
special for those of us who love baseball or cricket is the opportunity
to relax into a game. Baseball moves at a quicker pace than it used to,
but it still provides ample time for casual conversation and
contemplation of the action on the field. In each game it is time that
is privi- leged most. As I discussed in the previous chapter, all Homo
sapiens must grapple with impending death. As far as we know, Homo
sapiens is the only species that is aware of mortality. In short, our
time on Earth is the most precious gift we have. And while it may be
argued that [spending our time [efficient]{.mark}ly]{.underline} is
consistent with memento mori, what it typically [[amounts to]{.mark} in
a capitalist society is **[frantic multitasking]{.mark}** in order to
stay alive.]{.underline} \*\*\* In this chapter, I have deconstructed
the language of contracts as applied by the United States Supreme Court
to plea bargaining to demonstrate that [[the]{.mark} criminal legal
[**fetishization** of individual autonomy and efficiency]{.mark}, as
[contex- tualized with]{.mark}in the liberty of [contract]{.mark}
doctrine, [serves state interests]{.mark} in gov- ernmentality
[toward]{.mark} enhanced [social]{.mark} [control]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Through the application of social science, neuroscience, and
neurophenomenology, I sought to demon- strate the woeful inadequacy of
the concept of "autonomy" ("free will") to properly justify either pleas
or contracts (whether public or private). Finally, since the Court
introduced the private law of contracts (and not merely by analogy) to
the adjudication of felony criminal indictments, it only seems
appropriate that the conditions under which plea bargains are procured
should be scrutinized consistent with the law of contracts and
improperly obtained assent. In each of the areas of misrepresentation,
duress, undue influence, and unconscionability, there are serious
concerns relating to the procurement of plea bargains that, under
private law and statute, would void those bargains. However, to
facilitate assessment of the totality of cir- cumstances leading to a
plea agreement, we need a more thorough record of discovery and far
greater judicial review of substantive inculpatory and exculpatory
evidence. Finally, basing my argument on the preceding information, it
is my con- tention that plea bargaining violates the unconstitutional
conditions doctrine (Chapter 8) and that it leads to the commodification
of rights protections. Through the application of Foucault's emphasis
upon governmentality as efficiency, and his analysis of law as but one
institution existing among others available to facilitate the
realization of dominant cultural power, in the next chapter I present,
as Marx did before me with regard to surplus value (see Chapter 5), the
surplus power that exists whenever law is imposed upon a set of
political, economic, or cultural conditions. Specifically, the law
systemically presents as a detached apolitical and objective superstruc-
tural institution89 responsible for enhancing the likelihood of liberal
democ- racy.90 However, as with surplus value, surplus power as
expressed through law signifies the hidden expression of dominant
cultural capitalist inter- ests and values.91 [The law's rhetorical
expression of "[efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}" in private,
administrative, and public law [serves as surplus power]{.underline},
[a]{.underline} seemingly benign yet hegemonic [[expression of
**dominant** cultural]{.mark} [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
explained by Grewal and Purdy, "\[I\]n practice, [neoliberal policies
are always distributive decisions, yet ones in which [distributive
choices get]{.mark} [couched in the neutral- sounding language of
efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}, liberty, and responsibility, or the
pragmatic language of 'what works'."92 [Efficiency manifests as a core
principle in neo- liberal capitalist states through]{.underline}
hegemonic expression of the view that strong property rights and private
[contracting rights]{.underline} are the best means to increase overall
welfare, with the sole justification for polit- ical intervention being
to "correct market failures." The second premise is another version of
market fundamentalism, based on the belief that strong property rights
best protect the equal freedom and dignity of indi- viduals, so that a
commercial social order governed by the market is the most decent
society that is possible to achieve.93 In the spirit of unmasking
(Mannheim), Grewal and Purdy's application of political economic
critique to neoliberal expressions of efficiency exposes the surplus
power operating through ideology and hegemonically constructed legal
narratives. Specifically, here Grewal and Purdy conclude by making a
point similar to my own, [The way a series of constitutional doctrines
have coalesced around a vision of personal liberty that centers on
[individual]{.mark} [choice]{.mark}]{.underline} in spending,
consumption, and self-expression, [in **[disregard]{.mark}** of the
[legally constituted]{.mark} [structural]{.mark} [setting]{.mark} in
which these choices take place]{.underline}. In this kind of analy- sis,
the concept of neoliberalism ties together the operational effects and
ideological predicates of a series of judgments that work in different
doc- trinal areas, such as free speech, equal protection, and
substantive due process .... Neoliberal constitutional doctrines have
recently extended market-modeled liberty into areas of law where other
versions of liberty have previously been important.94 Having established
the liberty of contract doctrine in Chapter 5, and then having applied
contract law to the plea here in Chapter 6, we are left with one final
substantive analysis that will complete our political economic cri-
tique of the plea -- governmentality. Neither economic markets, nor the
con- struction of Homo economicus, nor the creation of slavery could
appear absent the theoretically, conceptually, and empirically central
role played by the state and civil society.

v\. the impact of criminal procedure exceptionalism in unconstitutional
conditions analysis In its own case law over the past century, the
Supreme Court has asserted and admired the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine's breadth as a shield for constitutional rights. In Koontz, for
example, the Court stated: We have said in a variety of contexts that
"the government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises
a constitutional right." . . . Those cases reflect an overarching
principle, known as the un- constitutional conditions doctrine, that
vindicates the Constitution's enumerated rights by preventing the
government from coercing people into giving them up.347 [This
Article]{.underline} has [demonstrated the **emptiness** of]{.underline}
such language, as the Court has not [applied this principle]{.underline}
in an "overarching" fashion. Instead, [[the Court]{.mark}]{.underline}
has [**[consistently ignored]{.mark}** the principles underlying the
**[unconstitutional conditions]{.mark}** doctrine when deciding
challenges raised under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments by those
suspected of or charged with crimes]{.underline}. [[The doctrine is a
**selective shield**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[not the]{.mark} [broad
protector of constitutional rights]{.mark}]{.underline} that the Court
purports to embrace. What is more, [offering the doctrine's protection
on this **selective basis**]{.underline} cannot be justified by pointing
to the features of the legal system in which it operates. Features of
the social and political landscape in which the Justices hear cases are
more likely to blame for the pattern we have identified. In this final
substantive part of the Article, we turn our attention to the det-
rimental impacts caused by the Court's decision to withhold the
doctrine's pro- tections from people accused of crime. We begin by
considering the doctrinal impact, exploring in more detail how a
thorough unconstitutional conditions analysis can shape the outcome of a
criminal procedure case. While we gestured to that effect in Part III,
in Section V.A we dive deeply into two cases from the lower federal
courts, Lebron v. Secretary, Florida Department of Children & Fami-
lies348 and United States v. Scott,349 to show how thoughtful judges
have assessed criminal procedure inquiries using the doctrine. We then
turn in Section V.B to the impact on the populations who have been
deprived of access to the uncon- stitutional conditions doctrine. We
consider the divisions the Court has created between rights and
rightsholders in the United States---without good reason--- and the
impact of these divides on the polity. A. The Doctrinal Impact: Swapping
Exceptionalism for Inclusion in the Criminal Procedure Docket What would
an unconstitutional conditions analysis look like in the criminal
procedure space? The Supreme Court would not have to look far to find
some excellent examples from the lower courts. The Eleventh Circuit
opinion in Lebron v. Secretary, Florida Department of Children &
Families scrutinizes mandatory, sus- picionless drug testing of people
on welfare using the unconstitutional condi- tions doctrine.350 The
Ninth Circuit's opinion in United States v. Scott offers a similarly
robust and critical assessment of the legality of drug testing as a
pretrial release condition. At issue in Lebron was the authority of the
State of Florida to require TANF applicants to submit to suspicionless
drug testing as a condition of receiving wel- fare benefits.351 First
the court considered whether mandatory, suspicionless drug testing of
this population was a constitutionally reasonable search under the
Fourth Amendment's special needs exception.352 If so, the Florida
program did not infringe on any right, thus precluding the argument that
the tradeoff of rights for benefits was an impermissible,
unconstitutional condition. But after careful review of the Supreme
Court's drug testing precedents, the Eleventh Cir- cuit concluded that
Florida's program was not a constitutionally reasonable search,353 thus
triggering a deeper look into the coercive nature of the tradeoff
imposed by the Florida statute. The State asserted that it could exact
consent from the TANF population by statutorily conditioning the receipt
of welfare benefits on submission to search.354 The Eleventh Circuit
firmly rejected that claim. It concluded that any such argument was
"belied by Supreme Court precedent, which has invalidated searches
premised on consent where it has been shown that consent 'was granted in
submission to authority rather than as an understanding and intentional
waiver of a constitutional right.'"355 According to the Eleventh
Circuit, Florida's statutory requirement amounted to a demand, rather
than a request, for consent, because, by this statute, "the State
conveys a message that it has the unfettered lawful authority to require
such drug testing---period. But it does not . . . ."356 In other words,
a statute cannot impose a scheme of implied consent that subverts, or
circumvents, constitutional analysis of coercion.357 After holding that
there was no operative consent imposed by the statute, the Lebron court
compared the burden on the TANF recipients' Fourth Amendment rights to
that experienced by plaintiffs alleging First Amendment violations
caused by other rights-for-benefits schemes. Reviewing these precedents,
the Eleventh Circuit observed that a state "could not place the burden
on taxpayers to attest that they did not advocate the overthrow of the
government in order to receive . . . a tax exemption" nor "force an
individual to choose between 'follow- ing the precepts of her religion
and forfeiting \[unemployment compensation\] benefits, on the one hand,
and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept
work, on the other hand.'"358 The court distinguished Wyman v. James on
the basis of the state action complained about; that case involved a
physical home search of a welfare recipient but did not concern drug
testing, which the court noted is governed by a different body of
"well-established prec- edent" requiring a court "to balance the
competing government and individual privacy interests."359 Drawing
insight about the limits to state-imposed coercion from these case
outcomes in other doctrinal areas, the Lebron court concluded that
Florida's statute "unconstitutionally burden\[s\] a TANF applicant's
Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches."360 A
second example of unconstitutional conditions analysis in the suspicion-
less drug testing context comes to us from the Ninth Circuit. In its
2005 opinion in United States v. Scott,361 the court considered the
constitutionality of a state court condition that required a pretrial
detainee to submit to suspicionless drug testing as a condition of his
release.362 The court asserted that "\[t\]he right to keep someone in
jail does not in any way imply the right to release that person subject
to unconstitutional conditions---such as chopping off a finger or giving
up one's first born."363 The only conditions the government can impose
as a con- dition of release are constitutional conditions, the court
declared.364 The government first argued constitutionality based on
consent,365 premised on the tradeoff of rights for benefits that is at
the core of unconstitutional con- ditions analysis. But the court
rejected the government's claim that Raymond Lee Scott had "willingly
consent\[ed\]" to the drug testing in return for the right to "sleep in
\[his\] own bed\[\] while awaiting trial."366 Consent derived from a
pre- trial release condition of this type, without more, was
insufficient in the court's view. "Pervasively imposing an intrusive
search regime as the price of pretrial release, just like imposing such
a regime outright, can contribute to a downward ratchet of privacy
expectations\[,\]"367 the court warned. The Scott majority then compared
the pretrial release condition to conditions imposed in other kinds of
bargains with the state, observing that contractors doing business with
the government can be required to sign a limiting clause,368 and that
welfare recipients can be required to submit to search-like home visits
as a condition of receiving benefits.369 But the fact that these
conditions were found to be constitutional was not dispositive of the
issue here. The majority noted that, in prior Supreme Court
jurisprudence,370 an employee's assent to a previously imposed
drug-testing term as a condition of employment was "merely a relevant
factor"371 in determining the strength of his or her privacy interest at
the time of the drug test; assent alone did not cause the privacy inter-
est to evaporate. Only assent to a condition that is reasonable can have
that ef- fect.372 Hence, any drug-testing condition in the pretrial
release context must survive a reasonableness analysis. To assess the
reasonableness of the condition imposed on Mr. Scott, the Ninth Circuit
focused on the germaneness of the condition, considered in light of the
problem it was meant to address. While it did not use the term germane-
ness, it found the connection between the condition and the asserted
govern- ment interest to be flimsy, rather than substantial \[T\]he
connection between the object of the test (drug use) and the harm to be
avoided (non-appearance in court) is tenuous. One might imagine that a
defendant who uses drugs while on pretrial release could be so overcome
by the experience that he misses his court date. Or, having made it to
court, he may be too mentally impaired to participate mean- ingfully in
the proceedings. These are conceivable justifications, but the
government has produced nothing to suggest these problems are com- mon
enough to justify intruding on the privacy rights of every single de-
fendant out on pretrial release. And it has produced nothing to suggest
that Nevada found Scott to be particularly likely to engage in future
drug use that would decrease his likelihood of appearing at trial.373
The court acknowledged that a pretrial release condition might be
justified in a particular defendant's case based on specific concerns
about flight; it might also be justified more generally by a legislative
finding.374 But the state made no showing on either ground. It thus
failed to convince the court that the search of Mr. Scott pursuant to
the condition was reasonable. These examples demonstrate that
unconstitutional conditions analysis is possible in the criminal
procedure docket and often leads to more carefully rea- soned analysis
than reflexive reliance on warrant exceptions or privacy catego- ries.
If the Supreme Court were to adopt this approach, it would bring its
crim- inal procedure jurisprudence into conversation with constitutional
jurisprudence in First Amendment, Takings, and Spending Clause contexts,
leading to more victories for at least some people facing accusations of
criminal conduct. Even where victory at the individual case level did
not result, future defendants would have a deeper well of arguments on
which to draw for future litigation and the Supreme Court would be
forced to confront its disparate treat- ment of different rightsholders.
B. The Symbolic Impact: Swapping Exceptionalism for Inclusion in the
Population of Rightsholders [The Supreme Court's [inconsistent
application]{.mark} of the unconstitutional condi- tions doctrine [has
a]{.mark} **profound** and [**disparate** impact]{.mark} on various
rightsholders]{.underline}. Koontz emphasized that [[the doctrine is
intended to provide a buffer]{.mark} for citizens [from **undue
coercion**]{.mark} by]{.underline} local, state, and federal
institutions of [government]{.underline}.375 [The Court's cases, though,
extend this protective shell only to certain classes of rightsholders,
while [leaving others **exposed** and
**vulnerable**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As exemplified by its rigorous use
of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine in the takings context to
protect landowners from regulations, [the Court has steadfastly used the
doctrine to safeguard property and other forms of wealth. Other
unconstitutional conditions cases focus on the ability of the government
to leverage its influence through grants of money]{.underline},376 but
[the primary recipients of this form of government largess are states
and organizations]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} monetary
[benefits]{.mark} instead [flow to indigent individuals]{.mark}, the
Court has resisted using the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine]{.underline} to address concerns about the regulatory burden
imposed by government programs. [While lower courts have invoked the
unconstitutional conditions doctrine [to protect]{.mark} vulnerable
citizens from **[forced waiver]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} their [Fourth,
Fifth, and Sixth Amendment]{.mark} [rights]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[the]{.mark} Supreme [Court has not "ask\[ed\] the]{.mark}
\[unconstitutional conditions doctrine\]
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}"377 even when explicitly invited to do
so. Even in the employment context---in which the Court has applied the
doc- trine---it offered protection for the right to earn income rather
than for nonmon- etary rights, such as the ability to engage in
political activity. Thus, federal offi- cials seeking to garner
honoraria for speaking engagements won protection from restrictive
rules,378 while mint worker George Poole, who wished to engage in
political organizing on his own time, lost.379 As we noted in Part III,
the Court's application of the unconstitutional con- ditions doctrine to
areas of criminal procedure would not necessarily translate into easy
victories for people charged with or convicted of crimes. Elastic stand-
ards already baked into criminal procedure doctrines,380 such as
reasonableness, may drive the same ultimate result for a particular
litigant as analysis grounded in the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine. But sometimes a litigant will win using the unconstitutional
conditions doctrine, as the Lebron and Scott decisions discussed herein
have shown. In particular, [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [[defendants
concerned about]{.mark} the coercive nature of **[plea
bargains]{.mark}** offered by the government, careful use of the
**[unconstitutional conditions]{.mark}** doctrine [should]{.mark} lead
courts to [question terms]{.mark} [that]{.mark} insulate the prosecution
from judicial review]{.underline},381 [[create]{.mark} **[significant
disparities]{.mark}** [in sentences]{.mark} between those who plead
guilty and those who go to trial for the same offense]{.underline},382
[or appear peripheral to the core bargain]{.underline}. And for those
who do not prevail on their unconstitutional conditions claim, the basis
of the loss still mat- ters. [The Court's repeated tendency to handle
criminal procedure questions as an isolated subset of cases, rather than
in the context of analytical [frameworks]{.mark} of unconstitutional
conditions, may have **[drained the well]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
which future liti- gants can draw when looking [for]{.underline}
arguments to raise in [new cases]{.underline}. For example, returning to
United States v. Knights, recall that the United States argued to the
Ninth Circuit and to the Supreme Court that the challenged [probation
condition---submission to suspicionless searches---related]{.underline}
closely to the main purpose of [probation]{.underline} (keeping a close
eye on probationers to readily identify signs of illegal behavior). In
the language of the unconstitutional con- ditions doctrine, this
condition would survive the test for germaneness, said the United
States, contrasting it to a condition that limited the free speech or
free exercise rights of this population.383 But rather than upholding
the condition on this narrow ground, the Court declared that
[[probationers]{.mark} as a class [have a lesser expectation of
privacy]{.mark} in their persons and belongings]{.underline}, and thus
that Mark James Knights had no basis to complain about what happened to
him.384 This holding is far more expansive than an unconstitutional
conditions-based holding would have been, and [it has significant
implications for probationers subject to searches in other contexts or
to other sorts of probation conditions]{.underline}. Consider Riley v.
California, for instance---the 2014 case in which the Court declared
that privacy interests in digital containers (cell phones and laptops)
re- main robust even following arrest, and thus require officers to
obtain a warrant f they want to conduct a search.385 If [probationers
have a lesser expectation of privacy than everyone else, [can]{.mark}
their [cell phones be searched]{.mark} incident to arrest, **[without a
warrant]{.mark}**? Likewise, [does the]{.mark} curtilage of the
[home]{.mark} of a probationer [receive less protection]{.mark}
[than]{.mark} the curtilage of [non-probationers]{.mark},]{.underline}
whose homes are protected from warrantless searches by the Florida v.
Jardines'386 trespass doc- trine? With respect to the second kind of
expansion, [[courts]{.mark} have routinely [vali- dated]{.mark} a range
of probation [conditions---like **requiring permission to
marry**]{.mark}]{.underline}387--- [that]{.underline} would surely
[raise questions about]{.underline} germaneness in the
[[unconstitutional conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} context if Knights
had followed that line of analysis. In short, the un- necessary breadth
of [the Court's holding]{.underline} in Knights could be, and mostly
likely [[has]{.mark} [been]{.mark},]{.underline} used as [[a **gateway**
to justify further **dilution** of]{.mark} [rights]{.mark}]{.underline}
for the probation population even in areas where the Court has embraced
a bolder conception of privacy in recent years. What is more, an
unconstitutional conditions analysis in criminal procedure cases would
require the Court to confront critical questions when assessing the
tradeoff of rights for benefits in certain contexts. When applying the
unconsti- tutional conditions doctrine in the context of takings, for
example, the Court has expressed concern about the coercive effects of
government demands; it has em- phasized the importance of germaneness
and proportionality in regulatory re- quirements. The Court has also
cautioned that because of the broad government discretion involved,
[individuals]{.underline} and businesses applying for land-use permits
[are "**especially vulnerable** to the type of coercion that the
unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits.]{.underline}"388 If the
Court were to apply the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to plea
bargaining or other areas of criminal procedure, it would have to ask
whether, [when presented with a plea deal or probation option, a person
accused of a crime might experience government **coercion**]{.underline}
akin to that facing a person seeking a zoning variance. It would have to
examine the germaneness and the proportionality of the requirement the
government wants to impose. [It would have to consider
whether]{.underline} the demands of [the prosecutor's
office]{.underline} or crim- inal court judge [are]{.underline}
comparably "**[extortionate]{.underline}**" to the demands of the zoning
board.389 Maybe the Court would ultimately conclude that the level of
coercion is smaller in the criminal court context than in the land use
context, but its com- parison would have to be explicit---perhaps even
explained. All cards would have to be on the table. And [reversion to
important policy goals served by the criminal legal system would not be
sufficient]{.underline}. Invoking a memorable phrase from the Sixth
Circuit, "[[The guaranties of]{.mark} protection afforded by [the
Constitution]{.mark} [are **most vital** where the **temptations to
abandon** them]{.mark} [in favor of]{.mark} attractive [policy goals are
**most seductive**]{.mark}]{.underline}."390 Coercion is far from a
uniform or monolithic concept; behavior that counts as coercive in one
setting might not amount to coercion in another.391 As ob- served by
Philip Hamburger, "\[O\]ne needs to recognize a complex spectrum of
economic, personal, and other pressures to accept conditions, and an
equally complex range of personal circumstances and psychology in which
different per- sons feel the same pressures differently."392 The point
here is that [[the Court's willingness to engage in]{.mark} a detailed
examination of [coercion in]{.mark} the speech, exac- tions, or
conditional federal [spending]{.mark} contexts [but]{.mark} steadfast
**[refusal]{.mark}** to do so [in]{.mark} the [criminal
procedure]{.mark} context [is]{.mark}]{.underline} both
**[[indefensible]{.underline}]{.mark}** and ironic, in light of the
longstanding refrain that criminal law (and procedure) systems require
excep- tional attention to the government-rightsholder relationship.393
This claim is premised on the idea that, [due to the distinctive nature
of criminal punishments, **more---not less**---should be required of the
government when using this branch of the legal system to regulate
behavior]{.underline}.394 The incorporation cases make the ar- gument
even more forcefully: these rights are fundamental prerequisites to an
ordered system of justice.395 Surely "the legal question as to when a
condition comes with constitutionally meaningful pressure"396 is just as
important, if not more so, in the criminal procedure realm as in these
other contexts. To quote Guy-Uriel Charles, "whether there are any
constitutional limits to the extent of the renegotiations" of
constitutional promises that are embedded in the Fourth, Fifth, and
Sixth Amendments is a question the Court must answer, rather than
dodge.397 And yet in criminal cases, the Court seems instead to cling to
senti- ments such as the following, drawn from Justice Scalia's
dissenting opinion in Mitchell v. United States: "Our hardy forebears,
who thought of compulsion in terms of the rack and oaths forced by the
power of law, would not have viewed the drawing of a commonsense
inference as equivalent pressure."398 Given this sentiment, one feels
compelled to ask how our hardy forebears would have re- garded permit
conditions on beach house construction projects.399 Lastly, the
[unconstitutional conditions framework requires courts to
assess]{.underline} candidly [the weight of]{.underline} the
individual's interest in his or her [constitutional
rights]{.underline}.400 As we discussed in the prior section of this
Article, the individual seek- ing protection from criminal sanction
would seem to have an extraordinarily strong interest in retaining the
citadel of privileges and rights that the Constitu- tion provides. These
are, to borrow from Justice Jackson, "really significant things."401
Unlike privileges or rights granted in the property or employment
context, [[the Constitution's offerings]{.underline}]{.mark} to a person
accused of crime [lack easy quan- tification]{.underline}, but that is
[because they [are **priceless**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One might even
surmise that [for]{.underline} generally [indigent]{.underline} groups,
such as criminal court litigants or welfare recipients, [a
constitutional right often means the most---because it is **all they**
**have**]{.underline}.402 In re- jecting a challenge on unconstitutional
conditions grounds, [the Supreme Court would have to [address]{.mark},
explicitly, [why the rights of the accused are worth less]{.mark} to
them [than the rights of property owners]{.mark} are to
them]{.underline}, or why the burden imposed on equally important rights
is more justified in the criminal procedure context than in the
employment context.403 The Court's existing criminal procedure opinions
evade this question entirely, and thus fail to meet the burden of ex-
plaining criminal procedure exceptionalism in this area. We believe that
[those accused of or charged with crimes are]{.underline} at least [as
de- serving of the doctrine's protections]{.underline}, if not [more
so]{.underline}, as the [civil plaintiffs who currently hold favored
status]{.underline}. Consider that [most actors who enjoy protections
from the unconstitutional conditions doctrine are transactionally
sophisti- cated---state governments, White House employees,
and]{.underline} many [property owners]{.underline} surely fit this
description---or are at least familiar with the transaction that leads
to the invocation of the doctrine. For example, a government employee
likely understands that she enters into some agreement about the terms
and conditions of her employment when she joins the government's
payroll; the property owner who applies for a permit to build a beach
house understands that the zoning board has authority to raise concerns
about the size and impact on surrounding properties. In contrast, at
least some people in the criminal legal system are likely to be less
sophisticated, and almost surely less sophisticated about the kinds of
transactions they are likely to confront in that system,404 and this
deficit is not the unconstitutional conditions vacuum in criminal
procedure 1483 cured by the Sixth Amendment's promise of representation,
for the reasons dis- cussed in Section IV.A. In previous work,405 we
have urged state courts to adopt their own state con- stitutional
doctrines of unconstitutional conditions. Even if the U.S. Supreme Court
refuses to acknowledge the application of the doctrine in the area of
crim- inal procedure, we hope state courts will develop their own robust
doctrines of unconstitutional conditions and apply them to criminal
procedure issues. Here, as elsewhere, state courts might take the lead
in demonstrating the feasibility and importance of this approach. Given
the primary role of state courts in adju- dicating criminal cases,
widespread invocation of state unconstitutional condi- tions doctrines
in state criminal cases would go a long way toward offering ap-
propriate protection to criminal defendants in the United States, thus
vindicating the rights of those most vulnerable---even if the U.S.
Supreme Court continues to ignore their plight. conclusion [By applying
the shield of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to protect
property rights and other forms of wealth but denying it to those facing
criminal charges, [the]{.mark} Supreme [Court]{.mark} has [**abdicated
its responsibility** to]{.mark} [protect]{.mark} both large portions of
the Constitution and [large portions of the population from]{.mark} the
**[coer- cive]{.mark}** exercise of [governmental
power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} If it is the responsibility of the
courts "to breathe the breath of life into constitutional rights . . .
in the very face of con- travening legislation,"406 the Court has failed
in this regard when it comes to some of our nation's most vulnerable
residents. In refusing even to acknowledge the unconstitutional
conditions issues presented in the criminal procedure con- text, the
Court has ducked the profoundly important question of why certain
segments of society deserve protection from government coercion through
tradeoffs and others do not. [[Not "ask\[ing\] the]{.mark}
\[unconstitutional]{.underline} conditions\]
[[question]{.underline}]{.mark}"407 in its criminal procedure cases has
[[led the Court to render the **Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
Amendment**]{.mark} rights [considerably]{.mark} more **porous**, and
thus **[weaker]{.mark}**]{.underline}, than the rights protected by
other amendments.408 This is far from a settled question, as Justice
Jackson's comment reveals. The availability of the unconstitutional
conditions doctrine could have an impact on the development of doctrine
in other areas where government largess is selec- tively distributed.
[Consider]{.underline}, for example, warr[antless government searches of
passengers riding mass transit.]{.underline} For decades, travelers have
grown quite accus- tomed to [searches of their person and
baggage]{.underline} before boarding airplanes. But in recent years
[governments have extended this practice to people using local transit
options such as buses and subways]{.underline}. [If riding public
transit is regarded as a privilege rather than a right, and if [searches
of one's body and backpack are predicated only on implied passenger
consent]{.mark}]{.underline}409---implied simply from the de- cision to
ride rather than walk---[the unconstitutional conditions doctrine could
play a role]{.underline} in determining the validity of such
searches.410 We should also take a hard look at recent programs that
require people ac- cused of crime to provide a DNA sample to receive a
dismissal of charges or a favorable plea deal. The most notorious of
these programs, currently run by the District Attorney of Orange County,
California, has been dubbed "**[[spit and
acquit]{.underline}]{.mark}**."411 [DNA tradeoff programs]{.underline}
[extend]{.underline} the **[coercive bargains]{.underline}** that we
have [long seen in the plea bargaining context]{.underline}, as [they
[require a person]{.mark} who wants a deal [to
yield]{.mark}]{.underline} not just [Fifth]{.underline} and [Sixth
Amendment rights]{.underline} but [[Fourth Amendment privacy
rights]{.underline}]{.mark} as well. [Is this]{.underline} not a form of
"**[dragooning]{.underline}**," [leaving people with "no real option but
to acquiesce]{.underline}"?412 What is more, at least in Orange County
this tradeoff is being required of people who are charged with very
minor crimes, not of those charged with serious offenses. [Some
interview subjects]{.underline} even [assert]{.underline} that the
[Orange County]{.underline} District Attorney [is filing these cases
just to obtain DNA samples]{.underline}.413 Surely our Fourth Amendment
deserves better. In between searches and pleas we can observe thorny
pretrial issues too. Over the past two years, for example, certain
[trial courts have required people being detained pretrial to accept a
COVID vaccine to be released on bail or on their own recognizance
pending trial.]{.underline} 414 We have considered the intersection of
COVID prevention practices with the unconstitutional conditions doctrine
in another article.415 Here, we mention this practice for its particular
relevance in the world of criminal procedure. The Fourth Amendment
insists that pretrial release conditions must be designed to help
achieve one of two goals: to assure the person's continued appearance at
court hearings or to protect the community from further crime. Pretrial
release contracts conventionally include terms like "stay away from the
victim" or "check in with this administrator once a week." The COVID
vaccine is certainly connected to community safety, but to a differ- ent
sort of community safety than the criminal courts typically safeguard.
[[Re- quiring a person]{.mark} who has been charged with a crime [to
submit to]{.mark} a medical in- jection as a condition of being released
back into the community]{.underline}, when all other concerns about
flight and future criminality have already been addressed (and when
other types of citizens can get exemptions for religious or health
reasons), [could be a **deeply problematic**]{.underline} move by the
government. [**[Forced vaccination]{.mark}** ar- guably [amounts to a
violation of **privacy** and **bodily
integrity**]{.mark}]{.underline}---perhaps even greater than that
required for a blood draw.416 And [justifying this heavy-handed practice
under the guise of "consent" does not solve the problem.]{.underline}
[[Consent]{.underline}]{.mark} in these circumstances
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} no less problematic---no less
[[coercive]{.underline}]{.mark}---than the sort of consent that has been
used to justify probation and parole terms for decades, [premised on the
idea that these populations are cloaked in a lesser expectation of
privacy than adults whose freedom is fully intact]{.underline}.417
Whether the Court will address these questions remains to be seen.
Strong headwinds generated by decades of jurisprudential friction and
the Court's seemingly unshakeable commitment to criminal procedure and
criminal defend- ant exceptionalism caution us to be realists. But we
urge the Court to [[embrace the unconstitutional conditions]{.mark}
doctrine]{.underline} as a valuable tool of constitutional anal- ysis in
its criminal procedure docket. If it were to do so, [the Court
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} begin the process of [**[restoring]{.mark}**
the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to their right- ful place [in
the Constitution and]{.mark} would honor its stated commitment to
[**equal justice under law**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Plea bargains are replacing trials in modem criminal cases at an
astonish- ingly fast pace. Statistics confirm that approximately 97%2 of
all federal criminal cases subject to minimum sentencing guidelines
resolve in plea agreements between defendants and prosecutors.3 Once
rare and disfavored by judges, plea bargains are now universally used
with too much judicial participation via a \"partnership with the
prosecution. Trial lawyers are evolving into \"plea lawyers.\"\' Jury
trials are seen primarily in the movies. The plea mentality has even
manifested itself in civil litigation: the number of civil cases going
to trial in federal courts has declined from 11.5% in 1962 to around
merely 1%.6 What explains this recent phenomenon? Severe sentencing
guidelines and mandatory minimum sentences have armed prosecutors with
the near unilateral power to compel a defendant to forego the jury trial
and instead enter into a plea agreement. Such [unchecked discretion in
the hands of prosecutors effectively **criminalizes** the defendant\'s
exercise of his right to a jury trial]{.underline}. Moreover, the
prosecutorial authority to compel defendants, especially those charged
with white-collar crimes, into [plea bargains has fundamentally
converted the adversarial system of criminal justice into an
inquisitorial legal system]{.underline}. Plea bargaining is not an
acceptable substitute for jury trials. Trials rely on the adversarial
process to seek out the truth, expose corruption, and pro- tect
individual rights. The presence of a jury acts as a constitutional
safeguard, shining a light on the actions of prosecutors and judges. By
con- trast, [plea bargaining operates more like an
inquisitorial]{.underline} [system in which [the prosecutor]{.mark}
[assumes the]{.mark} dual [role of fact finder and]{.mark} ultimate
[decision- maker,]{.mark} [selecting who to indict, what charges to
bring, and what sentence to impose]{.mark}.]{.underline} While trials
seek to discern guilt from innocence, the plea bargain seeks to expedite
the case, relieving the prosecutor from the burden of con- ducting a
trial or meeting the evidentiary burden required for conviction. Unlike
trials conducted in open court, plea bargaining is conducted in se-
crecy. Plea bargaining is not necessarily bad in and of itself, but its
extreme overuse raises concerns about the U.S. criminal justice system.7
The plea- bargaining process does not afford any constitutional or
ethical protections.\' For example, suppose police obtain evidence
illegally, without a warrant. [Prosecutors]{.underline} would prefer to
[keep a case built on warrantless evidence out of court]{.underline}
[rather than have the illegal police conduct exposed at
trial]{.underline}.9 A de- fendant arrested on the basis of illegally
obtained evidence, and facing the threat of significant jail time, may
be pressured to accept a plea agreement without having had any
opportunity to review evidence meaningfully.\'o Modern [plea
bargain]{.underline} practice [encourages a defendant to admit guilt to
a lesser offense on **questionable** evidence]{.underline}, and accepts
a lesser punishment in exchange for sacrificing the defendant\'s Sixth
Amendment right to trial. As the Fifth Circuit once observed,
\"\[j\]ustice and liberty are not the subjects of bargaining and
barter.\"\" The current criminal justice system adopts bar- gaining as
naturally as if the Founding Fathers had indeed incorporated it into the
Sixth Amendment.12 While plea bargains originally were used as a
practical compromise be- tween an overburdened prosecutor and a
defendant of certain guilt, modern- day plea bargains resemble one-sided
contracts of adhesion 3 favoring a prosecutor too often holding
insufficient evidence14 gainst a criminal de- fendant, particularly a
white-collar defendant, who is reasonably and under- standably unwilling
to risk being sentenced to purgatory under current sen- tencing
guidelines.\" A rational defendant, particularly in federal court,
cannot risk refusing a prosecutor\'s plea offer: prosecutors punish
those who reject plea agreements by stacking additional charges\' 6 and,
particularly in the cases of white-collar crimes, rely on sentencing
guidelines that take into account the size of the financial loss without
any requirement that the de- fendant be found to have intended the
loss.\' 7 On average, the defendant who turns down a plea offer and is
later convicted receives a sentence three times longer than under a plea
agreement.\" [Combined with a growing list of vague and poorly drafted
statutes defining various crimes, prosecutors can target individuals and
coerce them into plea bargains by promising to drop charges against
family members]{.underline}\' 9 [and freezing assets]{.underline}.20 [By
punishing the defendant with a sentence **three times** longer if
convict- ed at trial]{.underline}, modern day [plea bargaining does not
entail]{.underline} the same degree of \"[voluntary]{.underline}\" and
\"[intelligent choice]{.underline}\" made by the defendant as authorized
by the Supreme Court in Brady v. United States.2\' While acknowledging
the utility or impossibility of getting rid of plea bargains in the
modem criminal justice system, this article stresses the
unconstitutional effect of the unchecked discretion enjoyed by
prosecutors when coupled with incredibly long sentences for those who
risk conviction at trial, especially in complex white-collar criminal
cases. The enormous disparity in sentencing resulting from this practice
effectively criminalizes the defendant\'s right to trial and
fundamentally alters the adversarial legal system. First conceived as a
con- venient procedural tool of expediency, modem plea bargain practice
has supplanted trials altogether, severely punishing those few who dare
exercise their Sixth Amendment right to trial.2 2 This article proposes
a practical so- lution, one borrowed from the business world, to restore
parity between prosecutors and defendants charged in complex cases
popularly associated with white-collar crime.
**[Totalitarian]{.underline}** [societies]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} those envisioned by George Orwell in the novel
[1984]{.underline}, [rely on an **inquisitorial** legal system in which
the government has **absolute**, **unfettered** discretion to

up in [[the Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark}, where an
[[inquisitorial]{.mark}-style ju- dicial]{.underline}
[[system]{.underline}]{.mark} sought to [[maximize government power at
the expense of indi- vidual rights]{.underline}]{.mark}.24 [The
government enjoyed **immense** **discretion**]{.underline} to apply
vaguely-written laws to political opponents and other disfavored
individu- als. 25 Even today, [countries such as Iran continue to
exploit such prosecuto- rial mechanisms to suppress freedom of
discourse]{.underline}.2 6 The sad irony is that, while [the United
States]{.underline} may have won the Cold War, its [legal institutions
have gravitated toward resembling the inquisitori- al system of its
vanquished foe]{.underline}. In a true Orwellian twist, no citizen of
modem American society can possibly know all of his or her individual
legal obligations. For example, the Internal Revenue Code, inclusive of
criminal and civil statutes, comprises 73,000 pages of fine print.27
With over 5,000 federal criminal laws on the books, one legal scholar
has deter- mined that the average person unknowingly commits three
felonies every day. 28 Doctors accepting Medicare payments, directors of
publicly-traded companies, and tax lawyers, among other white-collar
professionals, often operate in perpetual fear of the regulation state.
Should their behavior at- tract the interest of a prosecutor, the
prosecutor may find some crime, such as obstruction of justice or
conspiracy, to threaten in order to gain coopera- tion.2 9 Thus,

The purpose of this article is to advance questions seemingly so obvious
that they largely go without comment in published legal scholarship. For
example, one could ask: What is the standard of proof required for
conviction via plea bargain? When compared to the constitutionally
mandated requirement that prosecutors must meet the burden of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt to convict at trial, does the criminal
procedure leading up to plea negotiations represent an unconstitutional
deviation both in principle and in practice? Should there exist a
pre-trial presumption of innocence?9 In the absence of a pre-trial
presumption of innocence and with the low standard of proof required for
indictment, is it likely that a significant number of accused but
innocent suspects may be wrongfully convicted? For reasons articulated
below, I do not believe that the criminal procedure leading up to [plea
negotiations]{.underline} satisfies the Supreme Court's high standard
for felony conviction, because these procedures [lack a presumption of
innocence]{.underline}. It is this presumption of guilt that generates
fertile ground for law enforcement and prosecutors to procure
convictions via grand jury indictments where only probable cause is the
standard of proof to indict. To convincingly develop my argument, I am
going to request that my readers suspend their disbelief. Since the
1970s, [plea bargaining has become so ubiquitous that much about [its
procedure has attained an **essentialist**]{.mark} [quality]{.mark}
[that takes for granted the requisite standard of proof in criminal
cases]{.mark}]{.underline}. At issue in this article is whether it is
conceptually and procedurally efficacious to frame plea bargaining
within the context of standards of evidence sufficiency, also referred
to as "standards of proof." When taken together, [institutional
rationales]{.underline} and the implementation of plea bargaining [have
been established as legal norms reaching hegemonic status]{.underline}.
That is, [nearly all criminal justice [practitioners]{.mark}, as well as
victims and offenders, [view]{.mark} the [institutionalization]{.mark}
[of plea bargaining as]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n immutable [**matter of**
**fact**]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 Whether it serves systematic efficiency
interests by saving resources, or by dispensing justice with greater
speed and efficiency, [plea bargaining exists for all actors as the
normative mechanism]{.underline} through which felony cases are
prosecuted. I quite intentionally invoke Antonio Gramsci's11
conceptualization of hegemony to introduce a theoretical level of
complexity. In doing so, I hope this will move our discussion away from
one that is exclusively doctrinal and internal to administrators of
justice in order to locate plea practice in a system- reproducing
context. Specifically, Gramsci defines social hegemony as possessing two
aspects: 1. [[The]{.mark} "spontaneous" [consent given by
the]{.mark}]{.underline} great [[masses]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
population [to the general direction [imposed]{.mark} on social life
[by]{.mark} [the dominant]{.mark} fundamental [group]{.mark}; this
consent is "historically" caused by the prestige (and consequent
confidence) which the dominant group enjoys because of its position and
function in the world of production]{.underline}. 2. [[The]{.mark}
[apparatus of state coercive power which "legally" enforces discipline
on those groups who do not "consent"]{.mark} either actively or
passively. This apparatus is, however, constituted for the whole of
society in anticipation of moments of crisis of command and direction
when spontaneous consent has failed]{.underline}.12 Colloquially, [we
may [define hegemony as rule by consent, backed up by the threat of
coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Actions taken by the Supreme Court,
Congress, and the Judicial Conference in the 1970s, as they pertained to
setting the foundation for plea bargaining, have generated consent from
bureaucratic actors administering justice (e.g., law enforcement,
prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges), defendants, and from the public
more generally. Invoking the concept of hegemony tips my hand as one who
views the proliferation of plea bargaining as being on par with enhanced
social control.13 After all, [[plea bargaining takes place in private,
requires **renunciation** of]{.mark} fundamental [rights
protections]{.mark}]{.underline},14 [[and proceeds following indictment
based upon]{.mark} the]{.underline} second [[low]{.underline}]{.mark}est
[[standard of proof]{.underline}]{.mark}.15 Included is the fact that
when presenting evidence before a grand jury, [prosecutors need not
concern themselves with Federal Rules of Evidence nor the presentation
of exculpatory evidence]{.underline} and can reconvene a grand jury as
frequently as necessary until finally procuring an indictment.16 [What
emerges is a portrait of state power that bears a striking resemblance
to the]{.underline} fifteenth-century [Star Chamber]{.underline};17
[hardly the epitome of due process]{.underline} in a democracy. Viewing
pleas through the lens of hegemony, [[a taken-for-granted normative
acceptance of an undernourished system of due process emerges where
public consent has been **manufactured**]{.mark} through a series of
significant legal and political maneuvers]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[[we cannot forget the]{.mark} potential [threat of]{.mark}
**[coercion]{.mark}** should a defendant reject the plea and elect to
pursue trial]{.underline}. [This threat is [leveraged by the]{.mark}
fact that that the defendant will confront a "**[trial
tax]{.mark}"**]{.underline}18 if convicted and as a consequence, suffer
a far graver punishment.19 With this in mind, [plea bargaining then
manifests as a "legal-rational]{.underline}"20 [mode of hegemonic state
power]{.underline}.21 Recognition of this fact appears [in
European]{.underline} [human rights law]{.underline} where [plea
bargaining]{.underline} in exchange for downward departures in
sentencing "[may violate the presumption of]{.underline}
[innocence]{.underline}" [because the incentive of a reduced sentence
may be at odds with the presumption]{.underline}.22 As my argument
develops in the following pages, it will be helpful to keep this
emphasis on hegemony in mind. Since the 1970s, the scales have tipped
heavily in the direction of pleas following indictment as opposed to
establishing proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial before triers of
fact. Given the pervasiveness of plea bargaining, we must step back and
deconstruct existing criminal procedure leading to indictment prior to
commencement of plea negotiations. This will allow us to discern whether
the standard of proof, upon which rests determination of the quantum of
proof necessary to indict, is a signifier that is comprehensive enough
to generate a conviction in a criminal case. II. S TANDARD OF P ROOF

#### Prosecutors coercively threaten capital punishment as a bargaining chip to secure guilty pleas, increasing life without parole

Death as Leverage The Supreme Court's 1968 decision [in United States
v. Jackson warned]{.underline} that [[conditioning]{.mark} [life]{.mark}
or death [on a citizen's willingness to demand a jury could be
**unconstitutionally coercive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Prosecutors]{.underline}]{.mark} quickly [discovered a workaround:
[announce the intention to seek death]{.mark}]{.underline}, wait for the
terror to ripen, [[then]{.mark} [exchange mercy for a guilty
plea]{.mark}]{.underline}. Legal scholar
William W.[ Berry III]{.underline} [calls the]{.underline} modern
[result "**[mandatory LWOP by threat of]{.mark} [execution]{.mark}**," a
system that equips prosecutors with a punishment they rarely intend to
carry out but cannot resist wielding as a hammer. ]{.underline} It works
because defendants understand the odds. Over 95 percent of felony
convictions in America are secured through plea bargains.  [Put an
executioner behind that bargain and the risk calculus changes
dramatically: [**confess and live**, or roll the dice and maybe
die]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kohberger's deal was only the newest, most
celebrated example. Since 2018 the Death Penalty Information Center has
tracked more than [**[two hundred]{.mark}** capital
[indictments]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[ended]{.mark} the same
way---death notice filed, guilty plea entered, death notice
[with]{.mark}drawn]{.underline}. [The swap happens so often]{.underline}
that veteran [defense lawyers keep a shorthand for it:
"**[death‑qualified leverage]{.mark}**."]{.underline} The Price Tag We
Hide Defenders of capital punishment sometimes answer the leverage
critique with dollars: if a plea avoids the high cost of a death trial,
is that not fiscal prudence? Yet the math cuts the other way. Even
attempting to secure death balloons expenses. An Indiana study found
that a capital prosecution and its direct appeal cost counties more than
ten times what a comparable life‑without‑parole case would. California's
own internal audit put statewide death‑row expenditures north of
\$4 billion since reinstatement in 1978---thirty times the price of
permanent incarceration, with only thirteen executions to show for
it. In other words, we lavish money on a punishment we then bargain away
for free. Human Error, Human Cost Since 1973, 200 people in the United
States have been exonerated after receiving death sentences. That is an
error rate intolerable in any human institution, let alone one that
extinguishes life. The same randomness that sends a Georgia killer to
life and a Floridian to death also steers innocent defendants onto
gurneys. Missouri executed Marcellus Williams last September even as DNA
evidence questioned his guilt and prosecutors asked for a reprieve.
Cases like his invite a grim thought experiment: how many of those 200
exonerations would have lived had they, like Kohberger, been offered
life for the magic word "guilty"? The View from Abroad Globally, America
now keeps unsavory company. Only fifty‑odd nations retain capital
punishment in law, and a far smaller cadre actually carries it out.
China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iraq dominate the annual execution
charts; the United States is often the lone Western democracy on the
list.  The same moral instinct that prompted Canada, Australia, the
entirety of Europe and most of Latin America to abandon the gallows has
not left American hearts---polls show support for death drops below
fifty percent when jurors are offered life without parole plus
restitution---yet habit and politics keep the practice alive. The
Extortion Problem Extortion is defined as obtaining something of value
through threats. [When the state **brandishes** execution to obtain a
confession, the line between legal plea bargaining and
[extortion]{.mark} blurs]{.underline}. [The prosecutor's [threat is
lawful]{.mark}, but [its psychological force is
**absolute**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Families desperate for
closure, counties wary of budgets, judges eager to clear dockets---each
has incentives aligned against the lengthy capital trial the
Constitution supposedly guarantees. Still, [[the plea deal's efficiency
**masks its violence**]{.mark}: [we leverage the fear of death to secure
a result]{.mark}]{.underline} we publicly claim is second‑best. Toward
Abolition with Accountability Critics of abolition often ask, "What
about the worst of the worst?" The Kohberger sentences answer: life
without the possibility of release, served in the isolation of a
maximum‑security unit, is punishment enough to satisfy even Idaho's
conservative electorate. It incapacitates, acknowledges gravity,
and---crucially---allows for correction if the justice system errs. Add
mandatory restitution funds for victims and periodic judicial review,
and LWOP can carry a weight the death penalty only mimics. America
abolished the stocks, the lash, and the gallows‑pole not because crime
disappeared but because our sense of justice matured. [[If a punishment
so irrevocable can be traded away]{.mark} on a Tuesday morning [for the
price of a guilty plea]{.mark}, [it is]{.mark} no longer punishment at
all. It is [a]{.mark} **[bargaining chip]{.mark}**---and bargaining
chips belong in casinos, not courtrooms.]{.underline}

The [impact of **death penalty** sentences]{.underline} Fears about the
[**coercive nature** of plea bargaining]{.underline} are perhaps [most
**pronounced** in **cases** in which **[prosecutors]{.mark}** have the
option to [pursue **a death penalty conviction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Critics note that when [taking cases to trial that may [result in a
**sentence to death**]{.mark}]{.underline}, people may be [more likely
to accept a plea deal]{.underline} [that]{.underline} they [would
[otherwise have **rejected**]{.mark}]{.underline}---due either to the
harsh terms of the sentence and/or their factual innocence.42 The threat
of the [death [penalty]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[used as
**leverage**]{.mark} by prosecutors in bargaining]{.underline}, and both
prosecutors and defense lawyers agree that the specter of a death
penalty puts prosecutors in a uniquely strong position.43 Although
analysis of actual cases is hampered by a relatively small sample to
draw from, the quantitative studies suggest that the option to pursue a
death penalty has a significant effect on plea bargaining. One such
study conducted a natural experiment capitalizing on the 1995
reinstatement of the death penalty in New York State to analyze changes
in case outcomes before and after the law change.44 The [study found

the **law** change]{.underline}, regardless of whether the prosecutor
had explicitly filed a notice to pursue the death penalty in the case.45
The [reintroduction of the **death [penalty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
researchers concluded, [made people [less likely to be offered a
**charge reduction**]{.mark}]{.underline} (typically the more
advantageous type of plea offer) and more likely to take a sentence
deal---[suggesting that prosecutors did indeed have]{.underline}---and
use---[greater power in plea bargaining]{.underline}.46 [A [study from
**Georgia**]{.mark} produced **[similar
results]{.mark}**]{.underline}.47 The study looked at eight years of
murder cases from across the state that met the criteria necessary to be
tried as capital cases. The researcher compared the outcomes of cases in
which prosecutors pursued the death penalty with those in which they did
not, using sophisticated statistical techniques to control for a variety
of case characteristics. They found that, all else being equal, people
charged in murder cases were approximately 20 to 25 percentage points
more likely to plead guilty when faced with the death penalty.48 Put
another way, the study suggests that when prosecutors actively pursue a
death penalty, people in an additional two out of every 10 cases are
deterred from going to trial.49 These findings have been supported
nationally. A comparison of 33 counties---some with the death penalty,
some without---found that, when the death penalty was available, 19
percent of first degree murder cases were resolved with a guilty plea
leading to a prison sentence of more than 20 years; in counties without
the death penalty, this was true for only 5 percent of cases.50 This
large difference in outcomes remained statistically significant even
when controlling for other case characteristics. In pleading guilty to a
life sentence, people are relinquishing their right to appeal, the
chance of an acquittal, and the possibility of a shorter sentence;
avoiding the death penalty is used as a "substantial incentive" to
encourage people to make this otherwise unappealing decision.51 Legal

The State v. The Body -- **[Controlling the soul of the
accused]{.underline}**: False Confessions [False]{.underline}
[confession]{.underline} can be one of the most problematic aspects of
wrongful conviction, for it [brings]{.underline} a palpable **[cognitive
dissonance]{.underline}** that can be distilled down to one question:
Why would anyone confess to something they did not do? For many, the
same many that find themselves on a jury, a false confession is an
inconceivable notion, as "only the guilty confess" is a social
construction laden with an almost inexorable power. [False
confessions]{.underline} [encompass]{.underline} not only
[psychological, emotional and physical aspects]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} also [the institutional power of the state, as well as
the "rightness" of state power as perceived by the
innocent]{.underline}. Obtaining a confession is one of the most
important aims of police interrogators, as an estimated 80% of cases are
solved by a confession (Conti, 1999). Confession evidence is considered
to be the most damaging form of evidence at trial (Underwager &
Wakefield, 1992; Wrightsman & Kassin, 1993; Zimbardo, 1967) as well as
serving to relieve doubts of judges and jurors (Driver, 1968; Reik,
1959; Schafer, 1968, Nietzel & Fortune, 1994) [Currently about **25%**
of the over 240 wrongful convictions overturned by DNA evidence in U.S.
have involved some form of false confession]{.underline} (The Innocence
Project, 2010). This problem has an ignoble history as Bedau and Radelet
(1987) discovered that [[in 49]{.mark} of 350 [wrongful
convictions]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} foremost [cause was a **false
confession**]{.mark} [brought]{.mark} about [by **coercive**
interrogation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tracking back even further,
Munsterberg (1908), in his book, On The Witness Stand, discusses false
confessions where, "in some instances [the confessing person really
believe themselves guilty]{.underline}" (p.146). All the above should
remind us that false confessions are not a new phenomenon, however, in
better understanding them, an appreciation of the power dynamics and
disciplinary forces at play is necessary. A complete examination of the
multi-variant nature of false confessions is beyond the scope of this
paper, however, some pertinent issues can be addressed. In the arena of
false confession, coerced-compliant and coerced-internalized confessions
are where the Foucauldian framework finds the most fertile soil.
Coerced-Compliant Confessions [**Coerced-compliant confessions** occur
when [a suspects]{.mark} [confesses]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite
knowledge of their innocence, [[due to **extreme**]{.mark} methods of
police [interrogation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gundjonsson, 1992; Kassin,
1997). These types of confessions are usually [the result of:
[threat/intimidation]{.mark}, [use of force]{.mark}, diminished capacity
(i.e. [mental impairment]{.mark}, [exhaustion]{.mark}, etc.), [ignorance
of the]{.mark} law, or devious interrogation techniques (i.e. [false
claims of]{.mark} [incriminating evidence]{.mark}).]{.underline}
Although not particularly intricate, the power-knowledge constructions
in these types of confessions are efficient, as [[they are]{.mark}
the]{.underline} direct [use of]{.underline} the
**[[Foucauldian]{.underline}]{.mark}** concepts of [[isolation]{.mark},
[control of time and the body to]{.mark} [deconstruct the suspect's
knowledge]{.mark} (i.e. I am innocent) into a knowledge that serves the
power implementations of the state (i.e. I confess).]{.underline} [For
individuals]{.underline} [isolated]{.underline} in an interrogation
room, [the [lack of]{.mark} [knowledge]{.mark} about judicial procedure
[is an area]{.mark} ripe [for an interrogator]{.mark} [to "help]{.mark}"
the docile suspect [through]{.mark} the use of **[plea
bargains]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as seen in the case of Marcellius
Bradford (IL), who 17 at the time, and with the help of the Cook County
State's Attorney's office, pled guilty and implicated three other
innocent men in the rape and murder of Lori Roscetti.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Foucauldian framework of [isolation/[solitude
creates a]{.mark} **pressure**, "with **[maximum
intensity]{.mark}**...that provides an intimate exchange between the
convict and the power that is exercised over him]{.underline}." (p.237).
[In using isolation as a [pressure]{.mark} tactic by which to
observe/control the suspect,]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} [state]{.mark}
also [provides]{.mark} [the]{.mark} one [option]{.mark} by which to
[relieve]{.mark} that [pressure]{.mark}, in which [the suspect is
"trained" to comply - via a **plea bargain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There
have been many cases of juveniles; the mentally disabled, etc.
confessing to crimes, however, for those outside this category,
isolation must be augmented by: (1) [a distortion of
knowledge]{.underline} and (2) an introduction of new knowledge to
explain the suspect's claims of innocence. These two augmentations [give
the suspect a means by which to acquiesce to the demands of the state, a
prime example of the Foucauldian [diversification and infiltration of
power]{.mark} in which the state [works with the body of the
suspect]{.mark}]{.underline}, not against it, as seen in the case of
Danial Williams (VA), "[[Williams]{.underline}]{.mark}, who was
exhausted and had not eaten since breakfast at around 9am, maintained
his innocence for the first ten hours as he wa[s interrogated by three
different detectives. He agreed to [take a]{.mark} [polygraph]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} was falsely [told]{.mark} that [he
failed]{.mark}]{.underline}." (Leo & Davis, 1999) The "knowledge" given
to Williams was not the misconduct by the detectives, but rather that
[some [machine]{.mark}]{.underline}, controlled by agents of the state,
had [[ascertained that **his body**]{.underline}]{.mark}...had
**[[failed his soul]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In essence, [[his body,
under the disciplinary forces of the state, could not contain his guilt
any longer]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now, [with confession in hand, the
state institutes as variety of disciplinary forces that ensure that the
confessor will be treated harshly at every stage of the investigative
and trial process]{.underline} (Leo, 1996). The confessor is more likely
to be incarcerated prior to trial, charged, and most importantly,
pressured to plead guilty in the courtroom. Confessions are so prized by
the state because, in the words of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William Brennan, "no other class of evidence is so profoundly
prejudicial" (Colorado v. Connelly, 1986:182). The power-knowledge
granted by confession permeates every aspect of the case. Poor witness
identification, which would never be admitted, becomes corroborating
evidence (Castelle & Loftus, 2001), police close the investigation and
make no effort to pursue exculpatory evidence (Leo & Ofshe, 1998),
prosecutors charge the highest number/types of offenses available
(Cassell & Hayman, 1996), defense attorneys pressure clients to accept
lesser charges to avoid a jury trial (Nardulli, Eisenstein & Fleming,
1988), it establishes an irrefutable presumption of guilt among justice
officials, the media, the public and jurors (Leo & Ofshe, 1998) and
judges are less likely to suppress even highly questionable confessions
(Givelber, 2000). Foucault's conceptualization of the state power
manifested through juridico-economic means is also evident as judges
tend to punish defendants more harshly for their claims of innocence,
viewing it as a cost to the state in time, effort and resources (Leo,
2008). The coerced- compliant confession calls us back to the "public
spectacle" of torture, as all parts of the carceral system -
prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges play a role in marking and
investing the body of the confessor so that it may emit the signs of
deviance, and reaffirm the power of the state, when brought before a
jury. Confessions are overwhelming in their disciplinary power,
especially coerced ones, which are extracted by the most intimate forms
of discipline on the body (i.e. stress, fear, deprivation, threat,
etc.). The coerced-compliant confession is a judicial broadsword, yet
there is also a scalpel, to cut around the edges, that the state wields
with equal effectiveness. Coerced-Internalized Confessions

#### Interrogations' false knowledge production is so coercive that they cause innocents to falsely internalize belief in their own guilt by destroying their preexisting knowledge of the self

**Dunning 10** \[Eric Dunning, researcher at the University of Alabama,
7-1-2010, "Wrongful Incarceration: A Foucauldian Analysis," Journal of
Theoretical and Philosophical Criminology,

Coerced-Internalized Confessions While coerced-compliant confessions run
parallel with the "public spectacle" of torture,
[**[coerced-internalized confessions]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
more [[punishment-oriented]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which [the confessor
is removed from the exposed, physical/psychological deprivations of
forced compliance and is tucked away - psychologically placed within the
walls of a carceral system]{.underline}. In the same manner that 18 th
century penal reforms focused more on controlling time and isolation as
means to invest "the incarcerated soul" with an understanding of the
proper means and modes of being a productive citizen for the state,
coerced-internalized confessions also focuses on the soul of the
confessor. A coerced-internalized confession is one in which
[[the]{.mark} [confessor]{.mark}, having been subjected to highly
suggestive methods of interrogation, [comes to believe]{.mark} that
[they committed the]{.mark} [crime]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kassin & Sukel,
1997; Kassin & Kiechel, 1996). [The starting point for
coerced-internalized confessions is the internal conception of the
confessor in regarding the very nature of the judicial system. [A
carceral society must exercise]{.mark} a very specific power- [knowledge
across the social body]{.mark}]{.underline}: [there is an inherent
"rightness" to the justice system, so the innocent need not fear
it]{.underline}. [The state has a vested interest in social inoculation
against judicial cynicism]{.underline}. This reaches back to a
Foucauldian framework, in which the diversification of the state power
serves to make the social body pliable and productive. In coerced-
internalized confessions, it is a micro-physical relationship, the
power-knowledge of the state against the social body writ small. One of
the results of the normalization of the carceral society is reflected in
research by Kassin and Norwick (2004), using 72 participants in a study
on theft and investigation; found that the [[innocent]{.mark}
participants were **significantly** more likely to [waive their Miranda
rights]{.mark} than those who were guilty]{.underline}. Further research
supported the idea that [naïve belief in the "power of their innocence"
to set them free was the major impetus for waiver]{.underline}. Whether
guilty or innocent, [any day an interrogator can get a suspect to waive
their Miranda rights is a good one]{.underline}. Peter Reilly, an 18
year old who confessed to killing his mother after several hours of
interrogation, provides tangible support for the "innocence mythos" that
has been cultivated by the state as a disciplinary force. When asked why
he waived his rights, Reilly said, "My state of mind was that I hadn't
done anything wrong and I felt that only a criminal really needed an
attorney, and this was all going to come out in a wash" (Connery, 1996,
p.63). The idea that innocence will clear matters up, is power-knowledge
construction that specifically targets the innocent, as previous
research (Softley, 1980; Leo, 1996) has found that those with no prior
felony record are far more likely to waive their rights than those with
criminal justice "experience." [[The]{.mark} [carceral]{.mark} justice
[system]{.mark} has **[individuated]{.mark}** certain bodies (i.e.
[former]{.mark} [felons]{.mark}), "[trained" them]{.mark} (i.e.
[incarceration]{.mark}) [and made them "capable"]{.mark} (i.e.
[power-knowledge]{.mark}) [of exerting their]{.mark} Miranda
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby reducing their visibility as they
fall silent - withdraw from the carceral system - and await their
attorney. However, [for the [innocent]{.mark}]{.underline}, [they
are]{.underline} in a micro-physical Panopticon, [induced into a
**conscious visibility** by consistent interactions with interrogators
in the [attempt to prove their innocence]{.mark}, [**complying** with
every request]{.mark} and answering every question, erroneously [waiting
for the "**innocence**]{.mark} **[mythos]{.mark}**" to take
effect]{.underline}. [This is a [power-knowledge]{.mark} dynamic with
the [scales]{.mark} [tip]{.mark}ped firmly [in favor of state
power]{.mark}, for [the innocent have no]{.mark}
[knowledge]{.mark}/experience [on how to]{.mark} exert their power (i.e.
[avoid false]{.mark} [confession]{.mark}]{.underline}). Once again, as
seen with the eyewitness, once [the innocent]{.underline} have entered
the carceral system of the interrogation room, they [become docile and
completely reactive to the state]{.underline}. The reactivity and the
limitations of power-knowledge are the proverbial final nails in the
coffin. [A false confession is only]{.underline} hours, maybe
[**minutes** away.]{.underline} However, with coerced-internalized
confessions, [the state must make the suspect truly believe they
committed the crime]{.underline}. The creation of belief comes from the
state reframing the suspect's body and mind. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark}
must find a way to [**[puncture]{.mark}** [the suspect's belief in
agency, free will and]{.mark} any lingering sense that they are in
[control of their body.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The interrogation
**breaks down** the suspect's knowledge of their selves]{.mark} and
institutes, through [discipline]{.mark}]{.underline}, a new form of
knowledge: [a knowledge that [gives the suspect a chance for]{.mark}
[absolution]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [a coerced-compliant confession
offers [a **plea bargain**]{.mark} to [help the suspect]{.mark} [protect
their]{.mark} body]{.underline} (i.e. no death penalty), [a
coerced-internalized one offers the suspect way to protect their
[mind]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. why did I do this?). [[It provides a
means for the innocent to explain why they find
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in the]{.mark}
[carceral]{.mark}]{.underline} mechanisms of the
[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}, "as Williams continued to deny
involvement, the [[interrogators]{.underline}]{.mark} began to
[[suggest]{.mark} that he could have '[repressed']{.mark} his
[memories]{.mark} of the crime]{.underline} -- that he could have
blacked out, or been sleepwalking, that he could have amnesia...at about
5:50 a.m., after almost 12 hours in the police station, Williams gave
in, and began to concoct a story of his involvement." (Leo & Davis,
1999) [Creating an **[internalization]{.mark}** that [causes a suspect
to believe they committed the crime]{.mark} is much more powerful than a
coerced one, for the suspect is far less likely to retract the
confession or fight its validity in the courtroom]{.underline}. So,
while coercion is the quickest means, internalization is the more
substantive of the two. Equilibrium and the Judicial State

Plea Bargaining and Improperly Obtained Assent The final step in our
economic critique of plea bargaining leads us directly to its
justification by the Supreme Court in Brady -- the application of a
juridically distorted law of contracts to plea bargaining. Since the
Court has found justification for the plea in contract law, it seems
only reasonable that [the law of contracts should equally apply to plea
bargains to deter- mine whether they are constitutionally
permissible]{.underline}. This section will focus exclusively on the
deficits arising from the application of contract law to pleas, with
particular emphasis placed on improperly obtained assent.57 [I will
focus]{.underline} exclusively [on misrepresentation, duress, undue
influence, and unconscionability]{.underline}. The reason for this
emphasis is consistent with the law of contracts and improperly obtained
assent where, "each of the promisors \[defendants\] ... manifested their
assent to contract and were competent to do so. Nonetheless,
[their]{.underline} [[assent]{.mark} [was]{.mark} alleged to have been
[induced by conduct]{.mark} on the part of [the]{.mark} promisee
\[[prosecutors]{.mark}\] [that undermines]{.mark} the normal signifi-
cance of a manifestation of [consent]{.mark}]{.underline}."58 As I will
demonstrate, the structure of [plea bargaining as a contract is such
that it is infected by four manifesta- tions of deficit that would,
under private law, render the contracts to be in violation of
constitutional law.]{.underline} **[Misrepresentation]{.underline}**
According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §159,
misrepresentation "is an assertion that is not in accordance with the
facts."59 Furthermore, §162 stipulates the following: (1) A
misrepresentation is fraudulent if the maker intends his assertion to
induce a party to manifest his assent and the maker a. knows or believes
that the assertion is not in accord with the facts, or b. does not have
the confidence that he states or implies in the truth of the assertion,
or c. knows that he does not have the basis that he states or implies
for the assertion. (2) A misrepresentation is material if it would be
likely to induce a reason- able person to manifest his assent, or if the
maker knows that it would be likely to induce the recipient to do so.60
[[Police only share]{.mark} case [info]{.mark}rmation directly [with
prosecutors]{.mark}]{.underline}. The typical plea case file will
include a police crime scene report, a presentencing report, and
possibly, though rarely, post hoc witness interviews. Three practices
sig- nify case misrepresentation: 1) [[withheld]{.mark} material
[impeachment information]{.mark}]{.underline}, 2) [[charge]{.mark}
[stacking, and]{.mark}]{.underline} 3) [[an actual factual]{.mark}
[basis]{.mark}]{.underline} upon which to conclude the truth of events
as asserted by the state. [[Each]{.mark} of these three practices is
[**fraught** with **misrepresentation**]{.mark}]{.underline} as defined
by §162. In United States v. Ruiz61 a unanimous Supreme Court held that
[the United States Constitution does not require prosecutors to share
material impeachment evidence with criminal defendants prior to entering
plea nego- tiations]{.underline}. The justification for the opinion,
written by Justice Breyer, pivots on the defendant's waiver of
non-jurisdictional defects that accompanies the guilty plea (as
discussed in the first part of this chapter), as well as the bur- den
that would be placed upon the state to conduct an investigation prior to
entering into plea negotiations.62 What this means is that prosecutors
who relied upon confidential informants and other witnesses providing
informa- tion leading to the subsequent arrest and indictment of a
defendant are not required to share the identities of those informants
and witnesses with the defendant for possible impeachment.63 [That means
that [there is no way for the defendant to]{.mark} know a) who bore
witness against them, b) their ability to [confront that witness]{.mark}
(**Sixth Amendment** waiver), or c) even know the sub- stance of the
information shared with prosecutors]{.underline}. What is as yet unknown
is whether the Ruiz opinion equally applies to withheld exculpatory
evidence that would at trial be guided by Brady v. Maryland64 and its
progeny. In those states with open discovery laws, inculpatory and
exculpatory evidence should be shared as a routine matter. But even in
those states, how would we know? Prosecutorial control over all
information relating to the case puts the defense at a serious
disadvantage regarding discovery. [Defendants will [not]{.mark} be
afforded the time or resources to conduct a [pre-plea
investigation]{.mark}, [resulting in **asymmetrical**]{.mark}
**control** over and dissemination of [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.
[[Charge stacking]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the
practice of intentionally **[overcharging]{.underline}** criminal
[defendants]{.underline} with violations of criminal law [to induce a
downward charge and sentence bargain.]{.underline}65 Typically, [these
are [charges]{.mark} that [the state has **no**]{.mark} **[inten-
t]{.mark}ion** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[pursuing]{.underline}]{.mark}
as part of its case in chief were the case to go to trial
[[since]{.mark} the existing [evidence would be **too**]{.mark}
**[thin]{.mark}**]{.underline} to gain a conviction. [[**Threatened**
but **superfluous** charges]{.mark} [are used as **bargaining
chips**]{.mark} held by the state and presented to defendants by
prosecutors as an indication of "**good-faith**"]{.underline}
[negotiations]{.underline} [over optimal benefits]{.underline}. [With
**little knowledge** of]{.underline} the evidence that actually exists
within [the state's file, the absence of resources (including time) to
properly investigate the case, and the probability of a conviction at
trial generating a far greater sentence than that offered by the plea
(the trial tax), the state is guilty of misrepresentation]{.underline}.
Finally, Federal Rule 11 provides no guidance for determining the quan-
tum of evidence constituting the "factual basis" necessary to convict by
way of a guilty plea. Syllogistically, it must be true that since guilty
pleas are the immediate byproduct of indictments, and since the standard
of proof necessary for a grand jury to indict is probable cause, we must
assume that the quantum of evidence necessary to meet the "factual
basis" criteria to convict by way of the plea is probable cause.
Probable cause is the second lowest standard of proof. This is, of
course, quite reasonable since [no case investigation has taken place to
generate a more robust accounting of alleged criminal
activity]{.underline}. [With no case investigation, neither the
prosecutor nor the defense attorney has much information]{.underline}
pertaining to factually accurate accounts of allegedly criminal events.
The question, then, is whether the probable cause standard generates
enough of a factual basis to meet consti- tutional muster. [[With
**one-sided** adversarial]{.mark} [control over]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[negligible]{.underline}** [case evi- dence]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
and no mandate to share exculpatory material impeachment evidence with
the defense]{.underline} (and likely any other exculpatory Brady
material), [[by what standard should we be assured]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[prosecutors are]{.underline}]{.mark} engaging in
[[truthful]{.underline}]{.mark} plea negotiations? In sum, [how does the
defendant prove a negative]{.underline}? When exposed to actual plea
practice, Federal Rule 11's "factual basis" standard is legal sophistry,
and as a result, [criminal defendants are subjected to **systemic
information asymmetry** generative of misrepresentation]{.underline}.
Duress [[Plea bargains are "negotiated" under]{.mark} conditions of
**[duress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And while the noun "duress" is not one
that most of us use in daily interaction, its meaning is well known to
all lay people. Simply, [duress means]{.underline}: "threats,"
"**[violence]{.underline}**," "constraints," or other action brought [to
bear on someone to do something **against their will** or better
judgment]{.underline}. The lay definition of duress provides context for
the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. While the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts speaks specifically to physical duress, basing my argu- ment
on my previously published work on neurophenomenology, I would add
psycho-emotional duress as well. Specifically, "the paradigm defense to
con- tract is that of physical duress. It seems obvious that [one's
'[consent']{.mark} to con- tract [is not binding if]{.mark} it was
[obtained by]{.mark} the use or threatened use of force]{.underline}."66
Barnett and Oman cite Lord Coke's expression of the conditions
manifesting physical [duress]{.underline}, and they
[include]{.underline}: ["1. for [fear of losse of life]{.mark}, 2. of
losse of member, 3. of mayhem, [and]{.mark} 4. [of
**imprisonment**]{.mark}]{.underline}."67 In §175 of the Restatement
(Second) of Contracts, the definition of duress includes the following:
(1) If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper
threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable
alternative, the contract is voidable by the victim.68 In §176, the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts identifies "When a threat is
improper."69 Among the list of actions that render a contract void, and
that would apply to plea bargaining, is: • [What is threatened is a
criminal prosecution]{.underline}. • [What is threatened is the use of
the civil process and the threat is made **in bad faith**]{.underline}.
• [The threat is a breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing under a
contract with the recipient]{.underline}. • A threat is improper if [the
resulting exchange is not on fair terms]{.underline}, and • (a) [The
threatened act would harm the recipient and would not sig- nificantly
benefit the party making the threat]{.underline}. • (c) [What is
threatened is otherwise a use of power for illegitimate
ends]{.underline}. The ways in which defendants confronted with the plea
are exposed to [duress include]{.underline}: 1) the **[trial
tax]{.underline}** (excessive sentence if convicted at trial), 2)
**[charge stacking]{.underline}**, 3) [minimal case
investigation]{.underline} (if any), 4[) no procedural access to
impeachment evidence]{.underline} (Ruiz), [and]{.underline} 5)
[threatening a defendant with increased punishment if the prosecutor's
plea offer is rejected]{.underline} and the defendant is con- victed at
trial (see Brady and Bordenkircher). Undue Influence Undue influence
puts prosecutorial pressure front and center during plea negotiations.
An expression of undue influence as applied to the law of con- tracts
appears in the 1868 case Hall v. Hall: [[To make a good contract a man
must be a **free agent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Pressure]{.mark} of
whatever sort which [overpowers the will]{.mark} without convincing the
judgment is a spe- cies of restraint [under which **no valid contract**
can be made]{.mark}. Importunity or threats]{.underline}, if carried to
the degree in which the free play of a man's will is overborne,
[constitute **undue**]{.underline} **[influence]{.underline}**, although
no force is used or threatened. A party may be led but not driven, and
[his acts must be the offspring of his **own volition** and not in
accord with someone else's]{.underline}.70 Barnett and Oman clarify the
meaning of the Hall opinion by stressing that [undue influence involves
the use of excessive pressure to persuade one vulnerable to such
pressure, pressure applied by a dominant subject to a servient
object]{.underline}. In combination, the elements of **[undue
susceptibility]{.underline}** in the servient person [and **excessive
pressure**]{.underline} by the dominating person [make]{.underline} the
latter's [influence]{.underline} [undue]{.underline}, for it results in
the apparent will of the servient person being in fact the will of the
dominant person.71 Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule
11, [[plea]{.mark} [bargains are]{.mark} entirely [the province of
prosecutors who determine]{.mark} a) [whether to charge]{.mark}, b)
[whether to plea]{.mark}, c) [the conditions of the plea]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} d) [the]{.mark} [proposed]{.mark}
[sentence]{.mark}]{.underline}. This process unfolds premised upon
indictment by grand jury where the standard for indictment is probable
cause. And while it may be said that the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel should abate concerns of undue influence, the scholarship
surrounding assistance of counsel in plea cases suggests that for a host
of economic and pragmatic professional culture reasons, [[defense
attorneys in no way]{.mark} serve to [ameliorate the power
imbalance]{.mark} constituting plea negotiations]{.underline}. For
reasons previously stated, [defendant]{.underline} Homo sapiens [is
presented with a **Faustian bargain**]{.underline}: a) [plead not guilty
and exercise the right to trial where, if convicted, the sentencing
ranges are draconian (trial tax), b) threaten to plead not guilty and be
pressured by prosecutors and/or judges to recon- sider the guilty plea
offer or risk the maximum sentence if convicted at trial (which may
include **execution**]{.underline} -- Brady and Bordenkircher), [c)
confront charge stacking (overcharging cases, which confuses the plea
negotiation by introducing duress), d) withholding impeachment evidence
(Ruiz), and e) withholding other non-jurisdictional defects known to the
prosecutor but not to the defendant]{.underline} (e.g., Brady v.
Maryland material). Finally, Rule 11's [prohibition on judicial
oversight]{.underline} relating to the sub- stance of the plea deal
[means]{.underline} that [the prosecutor, and **only the prosecu-
tor**]{.underline}, [has the power to administer the plea
process]{.underline}. Because [plea deals are arranged in
private]{.underline}, [based upon an admittedly **thin** police crime
scene report and a presentencing report]{.underline} ([[Why conduct
an]{.mark} [investigation]{.mark}]{.underline} at this point in the
process [[when]{.mark} [an admission]{.mark} of guilt [makes it]{.mark}
**[unnecessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}?), [and [without judicial
review]{.mark}]{.underline} of the substance of the charges and [[the
"factual]{.mark} [basis]{.mark}" nec- essary to establish whether the
appropriate charges have been brought and guilt has been properly
established]{.underline}, working a plea conviction case on appeal is
nearly impossible to do. That means that once codified, [[the plea deal
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[stand without any]{.mark}
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline} [[upon substantive or procedural
defects]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this context, [the plea should be
**voided** as an improperly obtained assent since "negotiations" took
place under circumstances of undue prosecutor influence.]{.underline}
Unconscionability The last of the concerns to be raised relative to
improperly obtained assent to contract is unconscionability. To be an
unconscionable act means an act that is "wrong" or "excessive." In the
language of contract law, [unconscion- ability means an absence of
meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with
contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other
party]{.underline} ... In many cases the [meaningfulness]{.underline} of
the choice [is negated by a gross inequality of bargaining]{.underline}
[power]{.underline}. [The manner]{.underline} in [which the contract was
entered is]{.underline} also a [relevant]{.underline} consideration. Did
each party to the contract, considering his obvious education or lack of
it, have a reasonable oppor- tunity to understand the terms of the
contract\[?\] ... But [[when a party of little bargaining]{.mark}
[power, and]{.mark} hence [little real choice, signs
a]{.mark}]{.underline} commercially unreasonable [[contract]{.mark} with
little or no knowledge of its terms, [it is hardly]{.mark}
[likely]{.mark} that [his consent]{.mark}, or even an objective
manifestation of his consent, [was]{.mark} ever [given]{.mark} to all
the terms]{.underline}.72 In order to prevail on a charge of
unconscionability, a defendant has avail- able §2-302 of the Sales
Contracts: The Uniform Commercial Code, and §208 of the Restatement
(Second) of Contracts. §2-302 provides for court consideration of the
substantive contractual agreement to determine whether unconscionability
existed, and if so, whether it tainted the contract. The Restatement
(Second) of Contracts, §208, applies nearly identical language, voiding
any contract, or part of a contract, where unconscionability has been
uncovered. Two problems are immediately noticeable when attempting to
apply unconscionability in the context of plea bargaining as a contract.
First, Rule [11 expressly forbids judicial participation in, or review
of, substantive plea negotiations]{.underline} and agreements (judges
affirm the knowing and volun- tary prongs during the plea colloquy, and
they issue the sentence). Second, [considering the absence of judicial
oversight, coupled with Supreme Court precedent forbidding defense
access to impeachment evidence]{.underline} (and possibly other
exculpatory Brady v. Maryland material) [known to the prosecutor during
plea negotiations]{.underline} (Ruiz), [charge stacking, and threats of
harsher pun- ishment if convicted at trial, we are left with a
negotiation procedure that bears the hallmark of
**unconscionability**]{.underline} but without any apparent statutory or
common law remedy. In sum, the [[private law]{.mark} of
[contracts]{.mark} [provides]{.mark} far [greater judicial
oversight]{.mark} and legal remedies [for unconscionably]{.mark}
procured [agreements]{.mark}, but it does so **because** [judges]{.mark}
have the authority to [scrutinize the terms and conditions generating
the agreement for fairness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike the prosaic
defense of the proof beyond a reasonable doubt stand- ard expressed in
Winship, Brady, with its emphasis upon [[contract
law]{.underline}]{.mark}, [ushered in constitutional protection for a
**[bastardization]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} both [criminal procedure]{.mark}
and contract law [since plea bargaining as a contract gives rise to
**improperly obtained** assent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contracts of
Adhesion In this final section of the chapter, I would like to explore
what I think may be a hybrid application of contract law to plea
bargaining. While it super- ficially appears to be a conventional
contractual negotiation between two parties where concerns relating to
misrepresentation, duress, undue influ- ence, and unconscionability as
related to the plea context are paramount, the plea bargaining context
also resembles contracts of adhesion. Contracts of adhesion are
typically entered into by two or more private parties nego- tiating a
deal. To the extent that contracts of adhesion are guided by pri- vate
and not public law, they do not automatically appear to apply to plea
bargain contracts negotiated between criminal defendants and the govern-
ment. In 1983, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School Todd Rakoff pub-
lished what is considered now to be the standard articulation of
contracts of adhesion.73 For Rakoff, there are seven characteristics
defining contracts of adhesion: 1. The document whose legal validity is
at issue is a printed form that con- tains many terms and clearly
purports to be a contract. 2. The form has been drafted by, or on behalf
of, one party to the transaction. 3. The drafting party participates in
numerous transactions of the type represented by the form and enters
into these transactions as a matter of routine. 4. The form is presented
to the adhering party with the representation that, except perhaps for a
few identified items (such as the price term), the drafting party will
enter into the transaction only in terms contained in the document. This
representation may be explicit or may be implicit in the situation, but
it is understood by the adherent. 5. After the parties have dickered
over whatever terms are open to bargain- ing, the document is signed by
the adherent. 6. The adhering party enters into few transactions of the
type represented by the form -- few, at least, in comparison to the
drafting party. 7. The principal obligation of the adhering party in the
transaction consid- ered as a whole is the payment of money.74 What
should be most apparent from Rakoff's list of adhesion contract char-
acteristics is the fact that, in the plea bargaining context, it is the
pros- ecutor who, constituted by points 1--4 listed above, holds
absolute power over "adherents" or criminal defendants. It is point 7,
"payment of money," that only slightly deviates from the felony plea
bargaining situation. That is, depending upon the seriousness of the
charge, some felony criminal defend- ants may be able to bargain with
prosecutors such that their punishment will be financial remuneration
provided to victims and/or the state. In that way, criminal defendants
confronting a plea offer are similarly situated to those private parties
prosecuted for violating adhesion contracts. More often than not,
however, in the criminal context, fines and fees are combined with some
kind of probation tail requiring a commitment to avoid criminal activity
or confront serious jail or prison time. Contracts of adhesion are
offered in a "take it or leave it" format. That is, in the private law
context, a contract's forms and terms have already been determined by
corporate attorneys and are used to establish boilerplate lan- guage
that applies to all who wish to engage with the party offering the ser-
vice. Adherents, those who pursue the good or service being offered by
the private seller, are confronted with a contract that includes the
"small print" necessary to establish the legal authority and
responsibility accruing to each party to the agreement. It is my
argument that, but for a few structural dif- ferences, plea bargaining
represents a hybrid juridical procedure guided by both conventional
contract law and contracts of adhesion.75 Let us return for a moment to
the plea bargaining process. Let us also be reminded of the fact that it
is the legislature that determines which behaviors will be considered
"criminal" violations of law. Those behaviors are clearly articulated
and appear as part of each state's criminal code. In addition, states'
legislatures are equally responsible for establishing the sentencing
ranges that apply to convictions of each type of criminal violation. For
exam- ple, in my home state of Arizona, the legislature has created
three classes relating to the crime of robbery: Robbery, Aggravated
Robbery, and Armed Robbery.76 A subject convicted of Robbery (a Class 4
felony) and who has no priors will be sentenced to between 1 and 3.75
years in prison. A subject with one prior conviction will confront a
sentencing range of between 2.25 and 7.5 years. For Aggravated Robbery
(a Class 3 felony), a subject with no priors may be sentenced to between
2 and 8.75 years in prison, while a subject with one prior will be
subjected to between 3.5 and 16.25 years in prison. Finally, for Armed
Robbery (a Class 2 "dangerous" felony), a subject with no priors is
confronted with a prospective sentence of between 7 and 21 years in
prison, while a subject with one prior "dangerous" conviction will be
sentenced to between 14 and 28 years in prison. The sentencing ranges
provide prosecutors with the ability to focus their sentencing
recommenda- tions upon the known facts of the case, with the more
serious facts (and the presence of prior convictions) pushing
prosecutors to the higher end of the sentencing range. Regardless, there
is still a discreet range, a non-negotia- ble framework, that is
presented to the adherent felony defendant in what is a "take it or
leave it" context. At the local level, institutional practices may
become ensconced over time and with regard to specific county attor-
neys and their preferences for punishing certain types of crimes (say
sexual assault or drug dealing) consistent with their community's
standards and expectations. Still operating within the charge and
sentencing guidelines, those local practices may deviate relative to
other counties in each state, but there will still emerge a specific set
of patterns and practices premised upon the legislatively enacted law
that produces a structured procedure for nego- tiating plea agreements.
At issue when confronting plea bargains as negotiated contracts is an
academic and judicial concern over the application of monopoly power.77
Readers will recall from Chapter 1 that plea bargaining is premised upon
Federal Rule 11 and accompanying case law. Federal Rule 11 requires
judges to establish in open court as part of a plea colloquy that the
defendant has entered the plea agreement without coercion by
establishing that the defendant understands the charges they are facing
and the rights they are relinquishing (knowing and intelligent), and
that they are voluntarily enter- ing into the agreement (voluntariness).
As I have previously demonstrated in Chapter 1, both the knowing and
voluntary prongs characterizing plea bargaining are empty signifiers
requiring far greater scholarly and juridical understanding. Given the
monopoly power constituting prosecutors in the plea context, and the
fact that it is unlikely that the defendant will be fully aware of the
nature of the terms of the contract, plea bargains as adhesion contracts
raise the specter of executive force to the level of concern that I have
reserved for it in this book. What is known to prosecutors is that most
defendants will not understand the terms and conditions of their
proposed charges and sentence. In fact, argues Rakoff, "the adhering
party is in prac- tice unlikely to have read the standard terms before
signing the document and is unlikely to have understood them if he has
read them."78 More impor- tant, prosecutors know this as well. As the
drafter of the proposed plea deal, "In all probability the drafting
party, too, knows this fact about adherents' behavior."79 For Rakoff, it
is this aspect of contracts of adhesion -- form clauses and the monopoly
power of prosecutors -- that raises questions about their
enforceability. And while the law and terminology used in the private
law context may not be properly or easily applied to the public law
context, in the case of Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.,80 Judge
Wright's explication of the unconscionability of adhesion contracts
applies to the plea bargaining case. Ordinarily, [one who signs an
agreement without full knowledge of its terms might be held to assume
the risk that he has entered a one-sided bargain]{.underline}. But [when
a party of little bargaining power, and hence little real choice, signs
a commercially unreasonable contract with little or no knowledge of its
terms, it is hardly likely that his consent, or even an objective
manifestation of his consent, was ever given to all
terms]{.underline}.81 Of course, our concern in this book is for the
felony plea bargain and not a "commercially unreasonable contract," but
with this one exception, Justice Wright's remark in Williams directly
applies to the plea. Questions relating to the probity of applying
adhesion contracts to pleas include whether there is a public interest
at stake, or whether "one party to the transaction had 'superior
bargaining power'."82 In his work addressing [[adhesion
contracts,]{.underline}]{.mark} Kessler contends that they most often
[[appear when]{.mark} there are significant **[power
imbalances]{.mark}** between the offering party and the
adherent.]{.underline} Specifically, Standard contracts are typically
used by enterprises with strong bargain- ing power. [[The weaker
party]{.underline}]{.mark}, in need of the goods or services,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [fre- quently [not]{.mark} in a position [to
shop around]{.mark} for better terms]{.underline}, either [[because
the]{.mark} [author]{.mark} of the standard contract [has a
**monopoly**]{.mark}]{.underline} (natural or artificial) or because all
competitors use the same clauses. His contractual inten- tion is but a
subjection more or less voluntary to terms dictated by the stronger
party, terms whose consequences are often understood only in a vague
way, if at all. Thus, standardized contracts are frequently contracts of
adhesion.83 Once again, it bears repeating that plea bargains take place
as part of pub- lic law. Contracts of adhesion are typically considered
ubiquitous in the private law context. But it is my argument that, with
very few substan- tive exceptions, [plea bargaining is a contract of
adhesion. Unlike a person who engages in negotiation over the purchase
of a new automobile where they will be confronted with the terms of an
adhesion contract and may shop those terms to other competitors in the
automobile market, crimi- nal [defendants are not free to
disengage]{.mark} from unfavorable plea negotia- tions [by
requesting]{.mark} to negotiate with [a different]{.mark} and perhaps
more amiable [prosecutor]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, [criminal
defendants "**get what they get**]{.underline}." [**[All power]{.mark}**
to determine whether to charge, what to charge, what to sentence, and
whether to negotiate [lies]{.mark} solely [within]{.mark} the purview of
[prosecutorial discre-]{.mark} tion]{.underline}. Kessler's assessment
of [the lawfulness of adhesion contracts]{.underline}, then, "[lies in
their being employed to exert **[monopolistic]{.mark}**, or at least
**oligopolistic**, [power]{.mark}]{.underline}."84 Consistent with a
Weberian analysis of contracts of adhesion is attention to the
bureaucratic organization of firms and institutions toward the use of
form documents. As a way to promote efficiency and consistency, form
documents facilitate coordination among departments; eliminate
linguistic confusion through the use of familiar terms; make efficient
use of expensive managerial and legal talent; provide for supervisory
evaluation of adminis- trative actions; and help to solidify the
organization's internal power struc- ture.85 Consistent with the
argument that I made in Chapter 5 regarding Homo economicus and the
liberty of contract doctrine, each of which was ideologically deployed
to the capitalist cause of framing all people as "free to labor," in a
similar way Rakoff suggests that "[The consumer's experience of modern
commercial life is one not of freedom in the full sense posited by tra-
ditional contract law \[i.e., liberty of contract\], but rather one of
submission to organizational domination, leavened by the ability to
choose the organi- zation by which he will be dominated]{.underline}."86
Here, Rakoff makes precisely the same connection to political economy
and domination that I have argued for throughout. That is, [the
ideological construct of "free labor" really only means the "freedom" to
choose one's oppressor]{.underline}. In the private law context
discussed by Rakoff, that would mean the "choice" between commercial
vendors. In the public law context, [framing criminal defendants as
atomized individuals who are confronting the power of the state alone to
"negotiate" the terms of their case falls squarely within the narrative
construction of Homo economicus and the liberty of contract doctrine as
applied to con- tract law]{.underline}. That being so, each of the
[concerns raised relating to power and information imbalances as
attaching to adhesion contracts are equally pre- sent in the plea
bargaining case]{.underline}. I conclude this section by arguing,
consist- ent with Rakoff, that adhesion contracts, like those I have
suggested are applied to the plea bargaining context, are unenforceable.
Once placed in its proper context as a matter primarily implicating the
ordering of power and freedom in our society, the general rule that con-
tracts of adhesion are presumptively enforceable cannot be upheld. [The
inevitable infringement of adherents' individual freedom that results
from the rule leads one to suggest that form terms should never be
enforced.]{.underline}87 There are two important principles raising
serious concerns about contin- ued reliance upon adhesion contracts for
plea bargains. [The]{.underline} first [concern is infringement upon the
freedom of the adhering parties]{.underline}. The second concern emerges
from the first. For Rakoff, [The danger of [upholding the]{.mark}
[**authoritarian relationship** between the drafting party and]{.mark}
the [adherent is]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [danger]{.mark} different in kind
from the risk that the terms of the transaction, overall, represent an
unfair exchange of values, and is less likely to be cured by
competition]{.underline}. Indeed, there is a very real possibility that
drafting parties will attempt to capitalize on any legal toleration of
form contracting. (My emphasis.)88

III\. THE PARALLELS Let me now turn to my main theme-the parallels in
function and doctrine between the medieval European system of judicial
torture and our plea bargaining system. The starting point, which will
be obvious from what I have thus far said, is that each of these
substitute procedural systems arose in response to the breakdown of the
formal system of trial that it subverted. Both the medieval European law
of proof and the modern Anglo-American law of jury trial set out to
safeguard the accused by circumscribing the discretion of the trier in
criminal adjudication. The medieval Europeans were trying to eliminate
the discretion of the professional judge by requiring him to adhere to
objective criteria of proof. The Anglo-American trial system has been
caught up over the last two centuries in an effort to protect the
accused against the dangers of the jury system, in which laymen ignorant
of the law return a one- or two-word verdict that they do not explain or
justify. Each system found itself unable to recant directly on the
unrealistic level of safeguard to which it had committed itself, and
each then concentrated on inducing the accused to tender a confession
that would waive his right to the safeguards. The European law of
torture preserved the medieval law of proof undisturbed for those easy
cases in which there were two eyewitnesses or voluntary confession. But
in the more difficult cases (where, I might add, safeguard was more
important), the law of torture worked an absolutely fundamental change
within the system of proof: it largely eliminated the adjudicative
function. Once probable cause had been determined, the accused was made
to concede his guilt rather than his accusers to prove it.
[In]{.underline} twentieth-century [America]{.underline} we have
duplicated the central experience of medieval European criminal
procedure: [we have moved from an adjudicatory to a concessionary
system]{.underline}. [[We **coerce** the accused against]{.mark} [whom
we find probable cause]{.mark} to confess his guilt]{.underline}. To be
sure, [[our means are **much politer**]{.mark}; [we use no]{.mark} rack,
no [thumbscrew]{.mark}, no **Spanish boot** to mash his
legs]{.underline}. But [[like the Europeans]{.mark} of distant centuries
who did employ those machines, [we make it **terribly costly**]{.mark}
for an accused [to claim his right to]{.mark} the constitutional
safeguard of [trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We **threaten** him with a
materially increased sanction if he avails himself of his right and is
thereafter convicted]{.underline}. [[This sentencing differential is
what makes plea bargaining **coercive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There
is]{.underline}, of course[[, a]{.underline}
[difference]{.underline}]{.mark}23 [between having your **[limbs
crushed]{.mark}** if you refuse to confess, [or]{.mark} suffering some
[extra years]{.mark} of [imprisonment]{.mark} if you refuse to confess,
but [the difference is of]{.mark} **[degree, not
kind]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Plea bargaining]{.mark}, like torture,
[is]{.mark} **coercive**]{.underline}.24 Like the medieval Europeans,
the [Americans]{.underline} are now operating a procedural system that
[engages in **[condemnation without
adjudication]{.mark}**]{.underline}.25 The maxim of the medieval
Glossators, no longer applicable to European26 law, now aptly describes
American law: confessio est regina probationum, confession is the queen
of proof. 23 This difference is related to differences in the sanctions
that characterize the medieval and the modem worlds. The law of torture
served legal systems whose only sanctions for serious crime were severe
physical maiming and death. The torture victim was coerced into a
confession that condemned him to the most severe of punishments, whereas
the plea bargain rewards the accused with a lesser sanction, typically
some form of imprisonment, in exchange for his confession. Obviously,
the greater the severity of the sanction that the accused's confession
will bring down upon himself, the greater the coercion that must be
brought to bear upon him to wring out the confession. [Plea bargaining
is as coercive as it has to be for the modem system of
sanctions.]{.underline} 24 [Defenders]{.underline} of plea bargaining
sometimes try to [minimize]{.underline} the force of [this
point]{.underline} with a reductio-ad- absurdum argument: [granted that
plea bargaining is coercive]{.underline}, [so is]{.underline} virtually
every exercise of [criminal jurisdiction]{.underline}, since few
criminal defendants are genuine volunteers. I think that the answer to
this argument is straightforward. [[The accused is made a criminal
defendant against his wishes, but not]{.mark} [contrary to his
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Constitution does not grant]{.mark}
[citizens]{.mark} any [**immunity** from]{.mark} criminal [prosecution,
but]{.mark} it [does]{.mark} [grant them]{.mark} the safeguard of
[trial]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Coercion **authorized by law** is]{.mark}
[different from coercion meant to **overcome the**]{.mark} guarantees of
**[law]{.mark}**. Coercing people to stand trial is different from
coercing them to waive trial and to bring upon themselves sanctions that
should only be imposed after impartial adjudication.]{.underline}
Sometimes, as I have mentioned in the text, a rather opposite argument
is made in behalf of plea bargaining----not that everything is coercive,
but that [a]{.underline} mere [sentencing differential is]{.underline}
not [serious enough to be reckoned as coercion]{.underline}. One can
test this point simply by [imagining a differential so
great]{.underline} {e.g., [death versus a fifty-cent fine]{.underline})
[that any reasonable defendant would waive even the strongest
defenses]{.underline}. [Like torture, [the sentencing
differential]{.mark} in plea bargaining [elicits confessions]{.mark} of
guilt that would [not]{.mark} be [freely
tendered]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It is]{.underline}, therefore,
[coercive in the same sense as]{.underline} [torture]{.underline},
although not in the same degree. The question whether significant
numbers of innocent people do plead guilty is not, of course,
susceptible to empirical testing. It is known that many of those who
plead guilty claim that they are innocent. See A. BLUMBERG, CRIMINAL
JUSTICE 89--92 (1970). See also text at note 29 infra (discussing North
Carolina v. Alford). Alschuler thinks that "[the greatest pressures to
plead are brought to bear on defendants who may be
innocent]{.underline}.'' Alschuler, The Prosecutor's Role in Plea
Bargaining, 36 U. CHI. L. REV. 50, 60 (1968). See id. at 59--62 for
evidence that [the threatened "sentence differential between guilty-plea
and trial defendants increases in direct proportion to the likelihood of
acquittal]{.underline}." Id. at 60. Alschuler reports one case that
resembles the hypothetical choice between death penalty and fifty- cent
fine: San Francisco defense attorney Benjamin M. Davis recently
represented a man charged with kidnapping and forcible rape. The
defendant was innocent, Davis says, and after investigating the case
Davis was confident of an acquittal. The prosecutor, who seems to have
shared the defense attorney's opinion on this point, offered to permit a
guilty plea to simple battery. Conviction on this charge would not have
led to a greater sentence than thirty days' imprisonment, and there was
every likelihood that the defendant would be granted probation. When
Davis informed his client of this offer, he emphasized that conviction
at trial seemed highly improbable. The defendant's reply was simple: "I
can't take the chance." Id. at 61. I do not think that great numbers of
American defendants plead guilty to offenses committed by strangers.
(The law of torture was also not supposed to apply in circumstances
where the accused could explain away the evidence that might otherwise
have given cause to examine him under torture. See J. LANGBEIN, supra
note 8, at 183.) I do believe that [plea bargaining is used to coerce
the waiver of tenable defenses]{.underline}, as in Attorney Davis's
example, supra, or [when the offense has a complicated conceptual basis,
as in tax and other white collar crimes.]{.underline} The objection is
sometimes voiced that if an accused is innocent, it stands to reason
that he will press his defense at trial; if an innocent accused does
plead guilty, he must necessarily be calculating that there is a
significant probability that the trier will fail to recognize his
innocence despite the great safeguards of trial designed to prevent such
error. If trials were perfectly accurate, plea bargaining would be
perfectly accurate, since no innocent person would have an incentive to
accuse himself. Ironically, therefore, anyone who would denigrate plea
bargaining because it infringes the right to trial must also assume that
the trial itself is to some extent recognized to be mistake-prone. The
response, of course, is that paradox is not contradiction. So long as
human judgment is fallible, no workable trial procedure can do more than
minimize error. The social cost of a rule of absolute
certainty---massive release of the culpable---would be intolerable. This
was the lesson of the medieval European law, and it explains why the
standard of our law is not "beyond doubt" but "beyond reasonable doubt."
I have said that European law attempted to devise safeguards for the use
of torture that proved illusory; these measures bear an eerie
resemblance to the supposed safeguards of the American law of plea
bargaining. Foremost among the illusory safeguards of [[both
systems]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [the]{.mark} doctrinal [**preoccupation**
with]{.mark} [characterizing]{.mark} the induced [waivers as
voluntary]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The Europeans made the torture victim
repeat his confession "voluntarily," but under the threat of being
tortured anew if he recanted]{.underline}. The American counterpart is
Rule 11(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which forbids the
court from accepting a guilty plea without first "addressing the
defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is
voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart
from a plea agreement."27 Of course, [the plea agreement is the source
of the coercion and already embodies the involuntariness.]{.underline}
The architects of the European law of torture sought to enhance the
reliability of a torture-induced confession with other safeguards
designed to substantiate its factual basis. We have said that they
required a probable cause determination for investigation under torture
and that they directed the court to take steps to verify the accuracy of
the confession by investigating some of its detail. We have explained
why these measures were inadequate to protect many innocent suspects
from torture, confession, and condemnation. Probable cause is not the
same as guilt, and verification, even if undertaken in good faith, could
easily fail as a safeguard, either because the matters confessed were
not susceptible of physical or testimonial corroboration, or because the
accused might know enough about the crime to lend verisimilitude to his
confession even though he was not in fact the culprit. The American law
of plea bargaining has pursued a similar chimera: the requirement of
"adequate factual basis for the plea." Federal Rule 11(f) provides that
"the court should not enter judgment upon \[a guilty\] plea without
making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis
for the plea."28 As [with the tortured confession, so with the
negotiated plea: any case that has resisted dismissal for want of
probable cause at the preliminary hearing will rest upon enough
inculpating evidence to cast suspicion upon the accused. The function of
trial, which plea bargaining eliminates, is to require the court to
adjudicate]{.underline} whether [the facts]{.underline} proven support
an inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Consider, however, the
case of North Carolina v. Alford,29 decided in this decade, in which
[[the]{.mark} U.S. Supreme [Court found it permissible to **condemn
without trial** a defendant]{.mark} who had [told]{.mark} the sentencing
court: "I pleaded guilty]{.underline} on second degree murder because
they said there is too much evidence, [but I ain't shot no
man]{.underline} \.... [I]{.underline} just [pleaded guilty because they
said [if I didn't]{.mark} [they would **gas** me for
it]{.mark}]{.underline} \.... I'm not guilty but I plead guilty."30 I
invite you to compare Alford's statement with the explanation of one
Johannes Julius, seventeenth-century burgomaster of Bamberg, who wrote
from his dungeon cell where he was awaiting execution, in order to tell
his daughter why he had confessed to witchcraft "for which I must die.
It is all falsehood and invention, so help me God . . . . They never
cease to torture until one says something."31 The tortured confession
is, of course, markedly less reliable than the negotiated plea, because
the degree of coercion is greater. An accused is more likely to bear
false witness against himself in order to escape further hours on the
rack than to avoid risking a longer prison term. But [the]{.underline}
resulting [moral quandary is the same]{.underline}.32 Judge Levin of
Michigan was speaking of the negotiated guilty plea, but he could as
well have been describing the tortured confession when he said, "[there
is no way of knowing whether a particular guilty plea was given because
the accused believed he was guilty, or because of the promised
concession]{.underline}."33 Beccaria might as well have been speaking of
the coercion of plea bargaining when he said of [the violence of torture
that it "confounds and **obliterates** those minute differences between
things which enable us at times to know truth from
falsehood]{.underline}."34 The doctrine of adequate factual basis for
the plea is no better substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt than
was the analogous doctrine in the law of torture. 32 Some of those who
have favored me with prepublication critiques of this paper have
resisted this point---largely, I think, because they do not give
adequate weight to the seriousness with which the law of torture
undertook to separate the guilty from the innocent. My critics suggest
that plea bargaining is in theory meant to have a differential impact
upon the guilty and the innocent, whereas torture was not. They contend
that the plea bargaining system means to tell the accused, "Don't put us
to the trouble of a trial unless you are really innocent," whereas the
law of torture gave the same message to both the innocent and the
guilty, "Confess or the pain will continue."

#### Plea bargaining undermines public trust and increases authoritarianism with less judicial checks and balances

\*NOTE: three stupidly long argumentative footnotes included

I think that both branches of the argument are mistaken. I have already
pointed out, supra note 24, that plea bargaining can and does induce
innocent defendants to convict themselves. As for the law of torture, I
should reiterate that the safeguards discussed above, see text at notes
6--9 supra, were designed for the sole purpose of separating the
innocent from the guilty, and the law of torture made express provision
for releasing those who did not confess under torture. See J. LANGBEIN,
supra note 1, at 16, 151 n.55. I am very willing to concede that the
safeguards of the law of torture were even less effective than those of
plea bargaining, but as I have said in the text, the difference is one
of degree and not kind. [[The]{.mark} factual [**unreliability**
of]{.mark} the negotiated [plea has]{.mark} further
[consequences]{.mark}, quite apart from the increased danger of
condemning an innocent man]{.underline}. In the plea bargaining that
takes the form of charge bargaining (as opposed to sentence bargaining),
the culprit is convicted not for what he did, but for something less
opprobrious. [[When people]{.mark} [who]{.mark} have [murdered]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} said to be [convicted of wounding]{.mark}, or when those
caught stealing are nominally convicted of attempt or possession,
[**cynicism**]{.mark} about the processes of criminal justice
[is]{.mark} [inevitably]{.mark} **[reinforced]{.mark}**.]{.underline}35
[[This **wilful mislabelling** plays **havoc**]{.mark} [with our crime
statistics, which]{.mark} [explains]{.mark} in part [why
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}--- uniquely among Western
peoples---[[attach]{.mark} so [much importance to arrest]{.mark}
[records]{.mark} rather than to records of conviction]{.underline}. I
think that [the unreliability of the plea, the mislabelling of the
offense, and [the]{.mark} underlying want [of adjudication]{.mark} all
combine to [**weaken** the]{.mark} [**moral force** of]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} criminal [law]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[public's unease about]{.underline}]{.mark} the administration of
[criminal [justice]{.mark}.]{.underline} The case of James Earl Ray is
perhaps the best example of public dissatisfaction over the intrinsic
failure of the plea bargaining system to establish the facts about crime
and guilt in the forum of a public trial.36 It is interesting to
remember that in Europe in the age of Beccaria and Voltaire, the want of
adjudication and the unreliability of the law of torture had bred a
strangely similar cynicism towards that criminal justice system. Our law
of plea bargaining has not only recapitulated much of the doctrinal
folly of the law of torture, complete with the pathetic safeguards of
voluntariness and factual basis that I have just discussed, but it has
also repeated the main institutional blunder of the law of torture;
[[Plea bargaining concentrates]{.underline}]{.mark} effective control of
[criminal procedure in]{.underline} the hands of [a single
officer]{.underline}. [Our formal law of trial envisages a **division of
[responsibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We expect the prosecutor to
make the charging decision, the judge and]{.underline} especially [the
jury to adjudicate]{.underline}, and [the judge to set the
sentence]{.underline}. [[Plea bargaining merges]{.mark} these
[accusatory, determinative, and sanctional phases]{.mark} of the
procedure [in the]{.mark} hands of the [prosecutor]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Students of the history]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the law of
[torture are reminded]{.underline} that the great psychological fallacy
of the European inquisitorial procedure of that time was that it
concentrated in the investigating magistrate the powers of accusation,
investigation, torture, and condemnation. [The]{.underline} single
[inquisitor]{.underline} who [wielded]{.underline} those powers needed
to have what one recent historian has called "**[superhuman
capabilities]{.underline}** \[in order to\] . . . keep himself in his
decisional function free from the predisposing influences of his own
instigating and investigating activity."37 The dominant version of
[American plea bargaining]{.underline} makes similar demands: it
[requires the prosecutor to usurp the determinative and sentencing
functions, hence to make himself judge in his own cause]{.underline}. [I
cannot [emphasize]{.mark} too strongly [how **dangerous** this
concentration of prosecutorial power]{.mark} can be. The modern public
prosecutor commands the **vast resources**]{.underline} [of the state
for gathering and generating accusing evidence]{.underline}. [[We
allowed him]{.mark} this [power]{.mark}]{.underline} in large part
[[because]{.mark} [the]{.mark} criminal [trial interposed]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} **[safeguard of adjudication]{.mark}** against the
danger]{.underline} [that he might bring those resources to bear against
an innocent citizen]{.underline}---whether on account of honest error,
arbitrariness, or worse.38 But the [plea bargaining]{.underline} system
has largely **[dissolved]{.underline}** [that safeguard.]{.underline}
While on the subject of institutional factors, I have one last
comparison to advance. The point has been made, most recently by the
Attorney-General of Alaska,39 that preparing and taking cases to trial
is much harder work than plea bargaining---for police, prosecutors,
judges, and defense counsel. In short, convenience---or worse,
sloth---is a factor that sustains plea bargaining. We suppose that this
factor had a little to do with torture as well. As someone in India
remarked to Sir James Fitzjames Stephen in 1872 about the proclivity of
the native policemen for torturing suspects, "It is far pleasanter to
sit comfortably in the shade rubbing red pepper into a poor devil's eyes
than to go about in the sun hunting up evidence."40 If we were to
generalize about this point, we might say that concessionary criminal
procedural systems like the plea bargaining system and the system of
judicial torture may develop their own bureaucracies and constituencies.
Here as elsewhere the old adage may apply that if necessity is the
mother of invention, laziness is the father IV. THE JURISPRUDENCE OF
CONCESSIONARY CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

B. The Importance of the PerceivedLegitimacy of the Legal System Courts
frequently recognize the importance of the perceived legitimacy of the
legal system. 103 [There is]{.underline} also [empirical support
for]{.underline} the proposition [that the perceived [legitimacy]{.mark}
of the legal system [is important]{.mark} to its
function]{.underline}.104 [A criminal justice system is effective
[to]{.mark} the extent it [induces compliance with its
rules]{.mark}]{.underline}. A system that is perceived as legitimate by
those subject to its authority will more effectively induce compliance
with its rules. People care about procedural fairness. \"\[[[P\]eople
are more interested in how]{.mark} [fair]{.mark}ly [their case
is]{.mark} handled [than]{.mark} they are in [whether they
win]{.mark}]{.underline} [\....]{.mark} \[N\]umerous studies conducted
over the last several decades have consistently found this to be
true.\"10 5 Moreover, [the perception of procedural [fairness is
**critical** to]{.mark} fostering [public
confidence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the legal system.1 06 Psychologist
Tom Tyler has argued that \"\[f\]our critical factors dominate evalua-
tions of procedural justice\": First, people want to have an opportunity
to state their case to legal authorities. They want to have a forum in
which they can tell their story; they want to have a \"voice\" in the
decisionmaking process. Second, people react to signs that the
authorities with whom they are dealing are neutral. Neutrality involves
making decisions based upon consistently applied legal principles and
the facts of the case rather than personal opinions and biases.
Transparency and openness foster the belief that decisionmaking
procedures are neutral. Third, people are sensitive to whether they are
treated with dignity and politeness and to whether their rights as
citizens and as people are respected. Finally, people focus on cues that
communicate information about the intentions and character of the legal
authorities with whom they are dealing.107 [The public perception of the
legal system is **critical** to its function]{.underline}. Consider the
different reasons one might obey a law. One might obey for fear of
direct sanctions if she does not obey. One could follow the law out of a
belief that what the law requires is just. To do so, however, is not so
much to obey the law as to act in the manner that one believes to be
morally correct, while at the same time enjoying the benefit that one\'s
moral belief fortuitously coincides with the mandate of legal authority
on the topic. One might, though, obey the law because she believes
\"that authorities have the right to dictate proper behavior.\"108 Among
these possibilities, moral reasons tend to be strongest; people act in
accord with laws they believe are just because they believe the laws to
be just.1 09 However, the perceived legitimacy of the source of
authority is also a significant factor in compliance.\"1O As Tracey
Meares wrote, \"\[w\]hile legitimacy is not as important to compliance
as is morality, there is empirical work demonstrating that [[legitimacy
matters more to compliance than]{.mark} instrumental factors, such as
[sanctions]{.mark} imposed by authorities on individuals who fail to
follow the law or private rules]{.underline}.\"\" That is, [the
perceived [legitimacy]{.mark} of the source of authority may [be **more
significant**]{.mark} to compliance-and]{.underline}, thus, [[to
the]{.mark} legal system\'s [ability to control
crime]{.mark}-[than]{.mark} to the [penalties]{.mark} imposed for non-
compliance]{.underline}. [[Criminal justice may more effectively control
crime by **example** than by deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline} This does
not suggest that perceived legitimacy predicated on procedural fairness
is the only factor relevant to compliance. As Lawrence Solum has noted,
\"satisfaction with the process is not the whole story about procedural
fairness.\"12 Nonetheless, \"\[a\]s a pragmatic matter, it is important
that citizens be able to regard procedures as legitimate so that we may
secure their voluntary cooperation with the system of civil justice.\"11
3 C. How Plea Bargaining Undermines the Perceived Legitimacy of the
Legal System

#### Treating low-evidence pleas and high-evidence trials as equivalent kills legitimacy

**Gilchrist 11** \[Gregory M. Gilchrist, Assistant Professor of Law at
the University of Toledo College of Law with an A.B. from Stanford and a
J.D. from Columbia, 2011, "Plea Bargains, Convictions And Legitimacy,"

https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/amcrimlr48&i=145\]/Kankee

C. How Plea Bargaining Undermines the Perceived Legitimacy of the Legal
System There are three primary ways that the practice of [plea
bargaining]{.underline} in its current form tends to
[undermine]{.underline} the perceived [legitimacy]{.underline} of the
criminal justice system. First, as previously addressed, 1 4 [[plea
bargaining is **less reliable** than trial]{.underline}.]{.mark} Second,
[[bargained-for convictions are treated the same as trial convictions
despite the **diminished reliability**]{.mark} of the
former]{.underline}. And third, [plea bargaining creates an incentive
for dishonesty.]{.underline} 1. Bargained-forConvictions, Despite Their
DiminishedReliability, Are Improperly Treated as Equivalent to Trial
Convictions [All who are convicted-be it by bargained-for plea or
hard-fought trial-are formally in the **same boat**]{.underline}. The
only distinctions arise in the context of sentencing and post-conviction
relief. For example, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines recognize that a
sentence reduction can be appropriate solely \"by timely notifying
authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby
permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting
the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently .
\... \"15 Convictions by guilty plea are also distin- guished from
convictions by trial in post-conviction proceedings. A plea of guilty
and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal
elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a
lawful sentence. Accordingly, when the judgment of conviction upon a
guilty plea has become final and the offender seeks to reopen the
proceeding, the inquiry is ordinarily confined to whether the underlying
plea was both counseled and voluntary. 1 6 But beyond sentencing and
post-conviction relief, [[a conviction is a conviction]{.mark}, [without
regard for how it was]{.mark} [obtained]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given the
disparate factors that lead to each type of conviction, [[treating them
as]{.mark} formally **[identical]{.mark}** [causes a
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[problem]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
criminal justice system. [Convictions carry numerous consequences,
including \"permanent or temporary ineligibility for federal welfare
benefits, educational grants, public housing, voting, handgun licenses,
and military service; prohibitions from various forms of employment as
well as employment-related licensing; and, for non-citizens,
deportation.\"]{.underline}\'17 Should the defendant find herself again
subject to the criminal justice system, the prior conviction may in some
circumstances be presented as substantive evidence,1 8 and it will be
considered as a factor in enhancing her sentence should she be
convicted.1 9 These consequences are imposed equally whether the
defendant was found guilty by proof beyond a reasonable doubt before a
jury of her peers, or whether she agreed to plead guilty based on her
calculation of the relative value of trial compared to a plea offer.
However, the latter has an attenuated relation to actual guilt.\' 2 0
[Treating]{.underline} importantly [[dissimilar cases alike is an
affront to]{.mark}]{.underline} the second factor identified by Tyler as
critical to engendering [faith]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
procedural justice of a system: **[[neutrality]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[which \"involves making decisions based upon consistently applied legal
principles.]{.underline}\" 2 1 [Treating the less reliable
conviction-by-plea identi- cally to the more reliable
conviction-by-trial undermines the perceived neutrality of the
system]{.underline}. Or, it does so to the extent people perceive these
categories to be importantly different. H.L.A. Hart wrote that a
\"leading precept \[of justice\] is often formulated as [\'Treat like
cases alike\']{.underline}; \... \[but this\] must remain an empty form.
To fill it we must know when, and for the purposes in hand, cases are to
be regarded as alike and what differences are relevant.\"12 2 But, as
addressed above, [convictions by trial and convictions by plea (in a
system that permits plea bargaining) are different in their relation to
evidence and actual guilt]{.underline},123 [and]{.underline} they thus
[merit distinctive]{.underline} [treatment]{.underline}. We care about
wrongful convictions. Our system of criminal justice is predi- cated on
valuing the avoidance of wrongful convictions more highly than the
maximization of rightful convictions.\' 24 [Where one method of securing
convic- tions is less able to avoid wrongful convictions and is less
directly predicated on evidence, it is a difference that
matters]{.underline}. [The failure to recognize that difference is an
affront to]{.underline} the principle of [neutrality]{.underline}-to
treat like cases alike and different cases differently. 2. Plea
Bargaining Creates an Incentive for Dishonesty

A. Violence and Dehumanization [[Prisons are places of **intense
brutality**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and **dehumanization**]{.underline}]{.mark}.70 In his seminal study of
the New Jersey State Prison, The Society of Captives, sociologist
Gresham M. Sykes carefully exposed how [the fundamental structure of the
modern U.S. prison **degrades** the inmate's basic humanity and sense of
selfworth]{.underline}.71 [**[Caged]{.mark}** or confined [and
**stripped** of]{.mark} his [freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the
prisoner is **forced to submit** to an existence
without]{.underline}]{.mark} the ability to exercise [the basic
[capacities that define personhood]{.mark}]{.underline} in a liberal
society.72 [The inmate's [movement is tightly
controlled]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes [[by chains]{.mark} and
shackles]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} always by [orders backed with the
threat of force]{.mark}]{.underline};73 his body is [[subject to
**invasive**]{.mark} cavity [searches]{.mark} on command]{.underline};74
he is [**[denied]{.mark}** nearly all [personal
possessions]{.mark}]{.underline}; his [[routines]{.mark} of eating,
sleeping, and bodily maintenance [are **minutely**
managed]{.mark}]{.underline}; he may communicate and interact with
others only on limited terms strictly dictated by his jailers;
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} he [[is]{.mark} reduced to an identifying
number]{.underline}, [[**deprived** of]{.mark} all that constitutes his
[individuality]{.mark}]{.underline}.75 Sykes's account of "the pains of
imprisonment"76 attends not only to the dehumanizing effects of this
basic structure of imprisonment---which remains relatively unchanged
from the New Jersey penitentiary of 1958 to the U.S. jails and prisons
that abound today77---but also to its violent effects on the personhood
of the prisoner:\[H\]owever painful these frustrations or deprivations
may be in the immediate terms of thwarted goals, discomfort, boredom,
and loneliness, they carry a more profound hurt as a set of threats or
attacks which are directed against the very foundations of the
prisoner's being. The individual's picture of himself as a person of
value . . . begins to waver and grow dim.78 In addition to routines of
minute bodily control, thousands of persons are increasingly subject to
long-term and near-complete isolation in prison. The Bureau of Justice
Statistics has estimated that [**80,000 persons** are caged in solitary
confinement in the United States, many enduring isolation for
**years**]{.underline}.79 Solitary confinement routinely entails being
locked for twenty-three to twenty-four hours per day in a small cell,
between forty-eight and eighty square feet, without natural light or
control of the electric light, and no view outside the cell.80 Persons
so confined may be able to spend one hour per day in a "concrete
exercise pen," which, although partially open to the outdoors, is
typically still con- figured as a cage.81 Raymond Luc Levasseur, who was
held in solitary confinement at the Fed- eral Correctional Complex at
Florence, Colorado, a prison devoted to solitary confinement (also
called administrative segregation (ADX)), wrote of the first year of his
isolation: Picture a cage where top, bottom, sides and back are concrete
walls. The front is sliced by steel bars. . . . The term "boxcar" is
derived from this configuration: a small, enclosed box that \[does not\]
move. . . . The purpose of a boxcar cell is to gouge the prisoner's
senses by sup- pressing human sound, putting blinders about our eyes and
forbidding touch. . . . It seems endless. Each morning I look at the
same gray door and hear the same rumbles followed by long silences. It
is end- less. . . . [I see forced feedings, cell
extractions]{.underline} . . . . [Airborne bags of shit and gobs of spit
become the response of the caged. The minds of some prisoners are
**collapsing in on them**]{.underline}. . . . One prisoner subjected to
four-point restraints (chains, actually) as [shock therapy had been
chewing on his own flesh. Every seam and crack is sealed so that not a
solitary weed will penetrate this desolation]{.underline} . . . . When
they're done with us, we become someone else's problem.82 Following
thirteen years of solitary confinement, Levasseur was released from
prison in 2004.83 The images that follow are not primarily intended to
render more vivid this exploration of incarceration and punitive
policing, but instead are incorporated to illustrate an important part
of this Article's argument: We must look at what these practices
actually entail, especially because so often the ideology of criminal
regula- tion renders much of the criminal process and its violent
consequences opaque or even invisible to us. By removing the violent
results of these regulatory approach- es from the center of our
attention, and often removing them entirely from our view, this same
ideology persuades us of the necessity and relative harmlessness of
incarceration and punitive policing. An abolitionist ethic, however,
requires us to confront what penal regulation actually involves rather
than assuming that creating a certain spatial distance---by putting
particular persons in cages, or controlling individuals and communities
through prison-backed police surveillance---satisfactorily addresses the
social and political prob- lems of violence, mental illness, poverty or
joblessness, among others, that those persons and communities have come
to represent. This photograph portrays prisoners who are suffering from
mental illness and subject to solitary confinement in an Ohio State
Prison, held in cages for a "group therapy" session: These persons'
bodies are revealed in this image as objects locked in isolated small
spaces, shackled, rendered plainly less than human. Cages are also used
for booking mentally ill inmates in California prisons, as reflected in
the record addressed in the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in Brown v.
Plata: 85 This is a suicide watch cell, also used for isolation, in a
state prison in Cali- fornia, drawn from a related court record: 86 [In
these cells, feces may be smeared on the walls as those detained
mentally de- compensate, the odor of rot and acute despair
palpable]{.underline}.87 As incarcerated populations have increased,
[solitary confinement has emerged as a primary mechanism for internal
jail and prison discipline]{.underline}, such that the actual number of
individuals confined to a small cell for twenty-three hours per day
remains unknown and may be significantly in excess of 80,000.88 Some
people are sentenced to "Super-Max" facilities that only contain
solitary cells; other people are placed in solitary confinement as
punishment for violating pris- on rules or for their own protection.
Stays in solitary confinement are often lengthy, even for relatively
minor disciplinary rule violations, and may be indefinite. For example,
one young pris- oner caught with seventeen packs of Newport cigarettes
was sentenced to fifteen days solitary confinement for each pack of
cigarettes, totaling more than eight months of solitary confinement.89
Another prisoner in New Jersey spent eighteen years in solitary
confinement. Although his solitary confinement sta- tus was subject to
review every ninety days, this prisoner explained that he eventu- ally
stopped participating in the [reviews]{.underline} as he felt they [were
"a sham, with no real investigation]{.underline}," [and **lost hope**
that he would ever be able to leave.]{.underline}90 Solitary confinement
has become a widely tolerated and "regular part of the rhythm of prison
life,"91 yet [this basic structure of prison discipline in the United
States entails **profound violence** and
**dehumanization**]{.underline}; indeed, [solitary confine- ment
produces effects similar to]{.underline} [physical]{.underline}
**[torture]{.underline}**. Psychiatrist Stuart Grassian first introduced
to the psychiatric and medical community in the early 1980s that
[prisoners living in isolation suffered a constellation of symptoms
including **overwhelming** anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and
sudden violent and self- destructive outbursts]{.underline}.92 This
pattern of debilitating symptoms, sufficiently consistent among persons
subject to solitary confinement (otherwise known as the Special Housing
Unit (SHU)), gave rise to the designation of SHU Syn- drome.93 Partly on
this basis, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations]{.underline} Special Rapporteur on Torture has
[[found]{.underline}]{.mark} that certain [U.S. practices of [solitary
confinement]{.mark} [violate]{.mark} [the]{.mark} U.N. **[Con- vention
Against Torture]{.mark}** and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Punish-
ment]{.underline}.94 Numerous psychiatric studies likewise corroborate
that [solitary confinement produces effects tantamount to
torture]{.underline}.95 Bonnie Kerness, Associ- ate Director of the
American Friends Service Committee's Prison Watch, testi- fied before
the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons that while
visiting prisoners in solitary confinement, she spoke repeatedly "with
[people who begin to cut themselves, just so they can feel
something]{.underline}."96 Soldiers who are cap- tured in war and
subjected to solitary confinement and severe physical abuse also report
the suffering of isolation to be as awful as, and even worse than,
physical torture.97 But despite its more apparent horrors, [solitary
confinement is simply an ex- tension of the logic and basic structure of
prison-backed punishment---punitive isolation and surveillance---to the
disciplinary regime of the prison itself]{.underline}. Solitary
confinement's justification and presumed efficacy flows from the assumed
legiti- macy of prison confinement in the first instance. [Prison or
jail confinement isolates the detained individual from the social world
he inhabited previous- ly, stripping that person of his capacity to move
of his own volition, to inter- act with others, and to exercise control
over the details of his own life]{.underline}. Once that initial form of
confinement and deprivation of basic control over one's own life is
understood to be legitimate, solitary confinement merely applies the
same approach to discipline within prison walls. But the basic physical
isolation and confinement is already countenanced by the initial
incarceration. In addition to the dehumanization entailed by the regular
and pervasive role of solitary confinement in U.S. jails, prisons, and
other detention centers, the en- vironment of prison itself is
productive of further violence as [[prisoners]{.mark} seek to
**[dominate]{.mark}** and control [each other to improve their]{.mark}
relative [social position through assault, sexual abuse, and]{.mark}
[rape]{.mark}]{.underline}. This feature of rampant violence, presaged
by Sykes's account, arises from the basic structure of prison society,
from the fact that the threat of physical force imposed by [prison
guards cannot adequately en- sure order in an environment in which
persons are confined against their will, held captive, and feared by
their custodians]{.underline}.98 Consequently, [order is produced
through an implicitly sanctioned regime of struggle and control between
prisoners]{.underline}. 99 [Rape]{.underline}, in particular, [is
**rampant**]{.underline} in U.S. jails and prisons.100 According to a
conservative estimate by the U.S. Department of Justice, [**[13
percent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} prison in- [mates have been
sexually]{.mark} [assaulted]{.mark}]{.underline} in prison, with many
suffering repeated sexual assaults.101 While noting that "the prevalence
of sexual abuse in America's in- mate confinement facilities is a
problem of substantial magnitude," the Depart- ment of Justice
acknowledged that "in all likelihood the institution-reported [[data
**significantly undercounts** the number]{.mark} of actual sexual abuse
victims in prison]{.underline}, [due to]{.underline} the phenomenon of
**[underreporting]{.underline}**."102 Although the Department had previ-
ously recorded 935 instances of confirmed sexual abuse for 2008, further
[analysis produced a figure of **216,000 victims** that
year]{.underline} (victims, not incidents).103 These figures suggest an
endemic problem of sexual violence in U.S. prisons and jails produced by
the structure of carceral confinement and the dynamics that inhere in
prison settings. In one notable case that makes vivid these underlying
dynamics, Roderick Johnson sued seven Texas prison officials for failing
to protect him from victimi- zation by prison gang members who raped him
hundreds of times and sold him between rival gangs for sex over the
course of eighteen months.104 Johnson, a gay man who had struggled with
drug addiction, was incarcerated for probation vio- lations following a
burglary conviction.105 Rape was so prevalent in the facility where
Johnson was incarcerated that it had a relatively fixed price: A former
pris- oner witness explained to the judge and jury at the trial that a
purchased rape in that prison cost between \$3 and \$7.106 When Johnson
sought protection from prison officials, he was told he would have to
"fight or fuck."107 Seeking to avoid liability at trial, one of the
prison official defendants, Jim- my Bowman, explained that prison
officials were not responsible for failing to protect Johnson because
"an inmate has to defend himself."108 Richard E. Wathen, the assistant
warden, conceded that "\[p\]rison . . . is a violent place," but he
testified that prison officials ought not to be held accountable under
the Eighth Amendment for repeated gang rapes of prisoners if there was
little offi- cials could have done to prevent the abuse: "I believe that
we did the right thing then, and I would make the same decision today. .
. . There has to be some ex- treme threat before we put an offender in
safekeeping."109 In any event, safekeeping in many detention settings
only amounts to soli- tary confinement. And though prisoners are less
likely to be subject to rape if they are held in relative isolation for
their own protection, they are likely to suffer other substantial
psychological harm, as previously noted.110 Ultimately, Johnson lost his
civil case as the jury found for the prison officials.111 After his
trial, John- son relapsed in his addiction recovery, reoffended by
attempting to steal money presumably to buy drugs), and returned to
serve out a further nineteen-year pris- on sentence.112 [These [horrific
experiences]{.mark} of incarceration [are not]{.mark} simply
[outlier]{.mark} forms of dehumanization and violence, but are produced
by the structure of U.S. imprisonment]{.underline}---[by the basic
manner in which caging or confining human be- ings strips individuals of
their personhood and humanity, and sets in motion dynamics of domination
and subordination]{.underline}. In research widely known as [the
**Stanford Prison Experiment**]{.underline}, psychologists Philip
Zimbardo and Craig Haney further elucidated these structural
dynamics.113 Notwithstanding subsequent criticism, their experiment
revealed [how the basic structure of the prison in the United States
tends toward dehumanization and violence]{.underline}.114 At the outset
of their now famous (or infamous) experiment, Zimbardo and Haney placed
a group of typical college students into a simulated prison environment
on Stanford University's campus.115 Zimbardo and Haney randomly
designated certain of the students as mock-prisoners and others as
mock-guards.116 What happened in the course of the six days that
followed shocked the researchers, professional col- leagues, and the
general public.117 Zimbardo and Haney found that [their "'institu- tion'
rapidly developed sufficient power to bind and twist human
behavior]{.underline} . . . ."118 Mock-[guards engaged with prisoners in
a manner that was "negative, hostile, af- frontive, and
dehumanizing]{.underline}," despite the fact that the "guards and
prisoners were essentially free to engage in any form of
interaction."119 "\[[V\]erbal interactions were pervaded by threats,
insults and deindividuating references]{.underline} . . . .
[The]{.underline} [nega- tive, anti-social reactions]{.underline}
observed [were]{.underline} not [the product]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} an environment creat- ed by combining a collection of
deviant personalities, but rather the result of an **[intrinsically
pathological]{.underline}** [situation which could distort and rechannel
the behavior of essentially normal individuals]{.underline}."120 The
Stanford Prison Study has been criticized for methodological, ethical,
and other shortcomings, but, despite its limitations[, it attests to the
dehumaniz- ing dynamics that routinely surface in carceral
settings]{.underline}.121 According to some critics, for instance, the
Stanford Prison Study reflects the participants' obedience and
conformity to stereotypic behavior associated with prisoners and guards,
ra- ther than an effect produced exclusively and directly by the
institutional environ- ment of prisons.122 But even if the study's
critics are correct, it remains true that these same features of
conformity and behavioral expectations obtain in actual prison
environments. Therefore, whether the Stanford Prison Study measures
institutional effects or the tendency of people in such institutional
settings to con- form to widely understood behavioral expectations
associated with such settings, it is still the case that [these settings
will tend to reproduce powerful dynamics of dominance, subordination,
dehumanization, and violence]{.underline}. Of separate though equal
concern, the violence and dehumanization of in- carceration not only
shapes those who are incarcerated, but produces destructive consequences
for entire communities.123 People leaving prison are marked by the
experience of incarceration in ways that makes the world outside prison
more violent and insecure; it becomes harder to find employment and to
engage in collective social life because of the stigma of criminal
conviction.124 Further, incarcerating individuals has harmful effects on
their families. The children, par- ents, and neighbors of prisoners
suffer while their mothers, fathers, children, and community members are
confined.125 Coming of age with a parent incarcerated generally has a
substantial and negative impact on the life chances of young people.126
It is insufficient to simply seek to reform the most egregious instances
of violence and abuse that occur in prison while retaining a commitment
to prison- backed criminal law enforcement as a primary social
regulatory framework. Of course, less violence in these places would
undoubtedly render prisons more hab- itable, but the degradation
associated with incarceration in the United States is at the heart of
the structure of imprisonment elucidated decades ago by Sykes: Im-
prisonment in its basic structure entails caging or imposed physical
constriction, minute control of prisoners' bodies and most intimate
experiences, profound de- personalization, and institutional dynamics
that tend strongly toward violence. These dehumanizing aspects of
incarceration are unlikely to be meaningfully eliminated in the U.S.,
following decades of failed efforts to that end, while re- taining a
commitment to the practice of imprisonment. This is especially so in the
United States for reasons related to the specific historical and
racially subor- dinating legacies of American incarceration and punitive
policing. Two hundred and forty years of slavery and ninety years of
legalized segregation, enforced in large measure through criminal law
administration, render U.S. carceral and punitive policing practices
less amenable to the reforms undertaken, for exam- ple, in Scandinavian
countries, which have more substantially humanized their prisons.127 The
following Subpart addresses the racial dynamics associated with incar-
ceration and punitive policing in the United States and the practices of
racial de- humanization through which U.S. carceral and policing
institutions developed. B. Racial Subordination and the Penal State

#### Guilty pleas are unfair negotiation -- first mover, asymmetric power, collateral consequences

INTRODUCTION In its ideal state, [the **American legal system** is built
on high-quality **adversarial** confrontation]{.underline}. [Two
opposing sides work **diligently** to promote their clients\' inter-
ests]{.underline}, and that competition is mediated through the prism of
the law and the rules of evidence to produce a just result. But
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the [[litigants has **dispropor-
tionate** power]{.underline}]{.mark} in [establishing the
rules]{.underline} of the game, [it]{.underline} [creates a **serious
challenge**]{.underline} to achieving justice. As [[a
prosecutor]{.underline}]{.mark}, I acknowledge that when I step into the
courtroom, [it often is not a fair fight]{.underline}. [In what game
does one team [get to decide the playing field and
structure]{.mark}]{.underline} in which the competition takes place? In
my line of work that happens every day. [I [decide who gets
charged]{.mark} and with which crimes]{.underline}. Those decisions,
[[along with]{.mark} \"[first mover]{.mark}
**[advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" often result in my deter- mining
the analytical framework within which the trial itself takes place.
[[Plea negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}, much like trials[, [suffer
from]{.mark} [a]{.mark} similar [**asymmetrical** power
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}. What can a defendant offer a prosecutor
in negotiations? The defendant can save me time and effort, which allows
me to move on to the next case and focus my resources on other cases.
The defendant can save me the embarrassment 75 and frustration of
potential defeat at trial. The defendant can help me reach a reso-
lution that will leave a victim feeling like I did my job because the
victim received some measure of justice. But it is really the first of
those three items where there is meaningful leverage, because the
balance can, more often than not, be accomplished through hard work in
the courtroom itself. Consider, how- ever, a defendant\'s ability to
save the prosecution time weighed against what I have to offer that
individual. [[I]{.mark} [may]{.mark} be deciding whether the defendant
will be [label]{.mark}led [a convicted felon]{.mark} or [have
a]{.mark}]{.underline} conviction of any kind forever on a [[criminal
record]{.underline}]{.mark}. In turn, [that decision might impact
whether the defendant gets **[deported]{.mark}**, keeps his **[security
clearance]{.mark}**, or loses [public housing
benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 I may be [deciding whether a defendant
faces [incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline} and is [exposed to the
**[trauma]{.mark}** [of jail]{.mark}]{.underline} or the penitentiary. I
may be deciding the daily schedule of that defendant for months and
years to come and whether that [individual will be obligated to
comply]{.underline} [with [probation]{.mark} and [community
service]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[That]{.mark} kind of [incentive]{.mark}
[structure]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[stacked up against a
defendant\'s]{.mark} mere [capacity to save me]{.mark} some
[time]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} like a David
versus Goliath battle, [[where]{.mark} **[Goliath]{.mark}**
[wins]{.mark} virtually **[every time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if
that is not enough, other components of the [existing legal structure
strengthen my hand]{.underline} as a prosecutor even more. The
[possibility of [charging a crime carrying]{.mark} a lengthy
**[mandatory minimum]{.mark}**]{.underline} might easily compel a
defendant who is otherwise reluctant to accept any plea offer into a
choice as severe as assuming the label of \"convicted felon[\" in order
to avoid the immediate pain of incarceration]{.underline}.3 [The
inordinate power that society has handed [prosecutors]{.mark} gives them
the ability to [strike **Faustian bargains**]{.mark}]{.underline}4 with
defendants, who may accept substantial long-term harm to themselves in
order to achieve a short-term benefit. It is easy for a defendant to not
consider the collateral consequences a conviction may have for their
future when they are told that by pleading guilty, they can avoid going
to jail today.5 [And it becomes **an ethical morass** when the
prosecutor is the architect of this style of negotiations. Prosecutors
are charged by the Model Rules of ProfessionalConduct with being
\"minister\[s\] of justice]{.underline},\"6 yet they have little
official guidance as to what actually defines justice within the context
of exercising this incredible power. The criminal justice reform
movement has stepped into the middle of this ethi- cal quagmire by
advancing numerous measures [to try to address this disparate power
structure.]{.underline} For example, reducing or eliminating mandatory
minimum sen- tences is one way that reformers have sought to transfer
power from the prosecu- tor to the neutral judge.\' But these types of
reforms offer only limited relief to the basic problem-a system premised
on adversarial conflict where one of the adversaries has
disproportionate power. [There are two primary reasons why these
legislative reforms are insufficient]{.underline} for resolving the
broader problem. [First, elimi- nating mandatory minimums is reform that
occurs at the margins]{.underline}. Yes, the elimi- nation of these
provisions takes away one tool by which a prosecutor can extract a plea
from an otherwise reluctant defendant. But the simple ability to charge
a crime in the first place, not to mention determining which crimes and
how many counts to indict, and the authority to effectively set an
upward cap on the defend- ant\'s sentence through the government\'s
sentencing recommendation, effectively means the prosecutor may still be
able to bring so much pressure to bear that a de- fendant believes he or
she has no choice but to plead guilty. [Second, we have to acknowledge
the very real possibility that these marginal reforms may not reach
deeper]{.underline} into the criminal system for a long time. The brutal
murder of George Floyd quickly captured the public\'s attention and
brought forth urgent calls for a fairer justice system.8 But rising
crime rates may call into question how committed voters remain to
change.9 The Washington Post recently reported how an increase in crime
rates are now compelling progressive politicians to distance themselves
from once seemingly popular efforts to defund the police and for voters
to step back from further systemic reform.1 0 The article also noted a
difference in the electorate by pointing out that in 2016, Kim Foxx won
the Cook County State\'s Attorney\'s race on a reform-minded platform,
achieving 72 percent of the vote.\" ~~F~~

[**Coercive factors** Of great concern to advocates]{.underline},
researchers, and defense counsel is the [inherently **uneven playing
field** between accused and prosecutor in **plea bargaining
situations**]{.underline}---especially given the wide arsenal of tools,
particularly around charging, that prosecutors can use to increase their
leverage in negotiations[. Researchers have looked at how two coercive
factors]{.underline} in particular influence plea bargaining outcomes:
[[pretrial detention]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the potential for a death
sentence]{.underline}. These [studies have concluded]{.underline} that
these [**factors** likely **play a [significant
role]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in inducing guilty
pleas]{.underline}]{.mark} so that people can obtain their liberty---or
even sustain their life. Pretrial detention The vast [majority of
[people]{.mark} in local jails]{.underline} are detained pretrial,
meaning that they [[have]{.underline} [not been]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[convicted]{.mark} of any crime]{.underline}, are [legally presumed
**innocent**]{.underline}, and are [a[wait]{.mark}ing **resolution** of
their **criminal cases** [behind bars]{.mark}]{.underline}---most often
because they cannot pay the bail set in their cases.18 Pretrial
detention status has far-reaching consequences for justice-involved
people. [Concern about this population]{.underline}---and the potential
negative impacts of detention on their criminal justice outcomes---[has
spawned a growing body of **research**]{.underline} that has established
a [strong correlation between **[pretrial detention]{.mark}** and [an
increased likelihood of **conviction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, longer
custodial sentences, and future system involvement.19 While it has long
been assumed that the pressure and isolating circumstances of
incarceration induce people to plead guilty more readily during the
pretrial phase---potentially explaining why people in pretrial detention
are more likely to be convicted than those who are
released---researchers have attempted only recently to specifically
examine the influence of pretrial detention on a person's plea
bargaining behavior.20 Using a variety of different methods, this small
body of [scholarship has **established** a strong **association**
between pretrial detention and pleading guilty]{.underline}. For
example, in a 2012 study examining 634 criminal cases in New Jersey
courts, researchers found that people who were detained pretrial reached
faster case dispositions, usually during the [pre-indictment
phase]{.underline}, than [people who were released]{.underline},
primarily because, as an interviewee described it, "defendants [[**plead
guilty** to get out of jail]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . get time served
or to get it over with."21 In a 2018 study [looking at nearly 76,000
arrests in Delaware, researchers]{.underline} similarly [uncovered that
[pretrial detention increased a person's likelihood of pleading guilty
by **46 percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}---although there were differences
depending on the person's race.22 Similar to previous research, the
study found that Black people were 10 percent less likely than white
people to enter into guilty pleas.23 To explain this finding,
researchers have postulated that plea bargaining may be less common
among Black people because they may receive less favorable guilty plea
agreements from prosecutors than do white people. Another reason may be
that Black people may be more distrustful of a legal system that
disproportionately and unfairly impacts them and, thus, less likely to
strike a bargain.24 Both the New Jersey and Delaware studies employed
regression analyses---a statistical method of measuring the relationship
between multiple variables---with only a limited set of controls based
on data that was available (for example, current charge aggregated into
broader offense categories, criminal history, and demographic
information). This means that they did not account for a number of
unobservable confounding factors that may have also influenced people's
decisions to plead guilty (such as strength of evidence, quality of
defense, individual cognitive biases, or wealth). To correct for this
potential bias and better estimate the causal effect of pretrial
detention on a person's propensity to plead guilty, four recent studies
conducted natural experiments---non-controlled observational studies
that exploit random assignment that occurs in "nature" and which provide
social scientists with a stronger inferential tool to potentially
improve the quality of their empirical inferences, particularly when
trying to infer causation.

#### Plea bargaining is coercive, distorts incentives, and is inconsistent.

A. Abolitionist Scholars [So what were the bases for the **academic
abolitionists'**]{.underline} view that [**plea bargaining** produces
**irrationality and injustice**]{.underline}? They were motivated by
some of the same con- cerns we have already seen, but the [scholarly
attack on **plea bargaining**]{.underline} went deeper and broader. I
will divide it into three categories, though they overlap and have
blurry boundaries. Academic opponents of plea bargaining in the 1970s
argued that plea bargaining [(i) [is **impermissibly coercive**]{.mark},
(ii) [distorts the **roles**]{.mark} **and functions** of each set of
actors in the **justice system**, and (iii) is [inconsistent]{.mark}
[with **constitutional law**]{.mark} and core **notions of
justice**]{.underline}. There was a fourth part to their argument---that
plea bargaining is not inevitable---but we will save that until after
exploring academic defenses of plea bargaining. 1. Coercion First,
academic abolitionists focused, naturally, on [plea bargaining's
coercive- ness]{.underline}. Writing in Ethics in 1976, for instance,
philosopher [Kenneth Kipnis **[compared]{.mark}** two
scenarios]{.underline}.206 In the first, [a person is [confronted by
a]{.mark} **[gunman]{.mark} demanding his money**]{.underline}. In the
second[, [a prosecutor offers an **innocent defendant**]{.mark}
charged]{.underline} [with rape [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[plea
to]{.mark} **simple [battery]{.mark}**]{.underline} and a sentence of
probation. "\[I\]f one had to choose," Kipnis argued, it "would be
reasonable" [to [prefer being the **robbery**]{.mark}
[victim]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[since]{.mark} at least [he can **sue the
gunman** later]{.mark}]{.underline}.207 "\[W\]e must seek a better way,"
Kipnis implored.208 Peter Zimroth, then on the New York University law
faculty, made a similar argu- ment in a 1972 New York Times Magazine
essay[. Even if plea bargaining was re- formed]{.underline}, he told
readers, ["[defendants who **plead guilty**]{.underline}]{.mark} [will
[get a **break in sentencing**]{.mark} simply because they plead
guilty]{.underline}."209 "As long as that is so," he explained, "[[there
will be]{.mark} a **[strong]{.mark}** element of
[coercion]{.mark}]{.underline} in the system."210 We have seen the
coercion objection to plea bargaining raised before.211 While the
academic version added so- phistication,212 we will do better to dwell
on more novel aspects of the scholars' case against plea bargaining. 2.
Role Distortion Second, academic abolitionists---Alschuler, in
particular---focused on how [[plea bargaining **distorts**]{.mark} the
**[incentives]{.mark} of judges**]{.underline}, prosecutors, and defense
lawyers. [Alschuler wrote three articles]{.underline} on this theme, one
[for each **subprofessional group**]{.underline}.213 The [work was based
on interviews]{.underline} he had [conducted in **ten major
cities**]{.underline} in 1967 and 1968, which he described as a "kind of
legal journalism."214 All told[, the articles run nearly three-hundred
**law review pages**]{.underline}, so we can do little more here than
gesture to their flavor. The first, in 1968, tackled the prosecutor's
role. Everyone agrees, Alschuler posited, that criminal punishment
"should be based on penologically relevant con- siderations."215 Yet
under [plea bargaining]{.underline} it often is not, because prosecutors
face [pressures]{.underline} to [make deals based on considerations
lacking legitimate penological sig- nificance]{.underline}. For example,
imagine that [[a]{.underline} [prosecutor
realizes]{.underline}]{.mark}[, after charging a case]{.underline}, that
there is [an]{.underline} [evidentiary problem]{.underline} such that
[[the]{.underline} [defendant would]{.underline}]{.mark} [probably [be
**acquitted**]{.mark} **at trial**]{.underline}. Because [[the
prosecutor's incentive]{.underline}]{.mark}, Alschuler explained, [[is
to "get something from **every** defendant]{.underline}]{.mark},"216
[[his]{.mark} [response will be to make a "**generous**"
offer]{.mark}.]{.underline} But that means that [**[no
matter]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
[defendant's]{.underline}]{.mark} **[guilt or
[innocence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the punishment is **guaran- teed**
to be wrong]{.underline}! [Either it will be too generous, if the
defendant is guilty, or unjust, if he is innocent]{.underline}.
Alschuler's point was not that plea bargaining yields overly puni- tive
outcomes,217 but that it produces irrational results. Seven years later,
Alschuler published the next piece of the trilogy, on defense
lawyers.218 He was, by then, more strident. The article is a forceful
challenge to the assumption of plea bargaining's supporters---including
in the judiciary---that "[crim- inal defense attorneys will, almost
invariably, urge their clients to **choose the course** that is in the
**client's best interests**]{.underline}."219 Alschuler argued that this
is simply untrue, because plea bargaining is "necessarily destructive of
sound attorney-client relation- ships."220 For retained counsel, the
"path to personal wealth" for most defense law- yers is a high-volume
practice, and the "way to handle a large volume of cases is, of course,
not to try them but to plead them."

### Contention 8: Carceral Capitalism

#### Plea bargaining fairness is premised on homo economicus, a contrived narrative of our perfect utility maximization capacity that justifies capricious contracts under the guise of voluntariness

PLEA BARGAINING AS CONTRACT Autonomy and Efficiency In the preceding
chapter, I introduced the liberty of contract doctrine and the
ideological construction of Homo economicus. By way of reminder, it is
my argument that [the constitutionality of plea bargaining is
articulated as a product of framing human subjects as "free
agents]{.underline}" confronting accusations made by the state of
criminal wrongdoing [armed with the power to negotiate the terms of a
contract]{.underline} that will benefit both the state and the accused.
[The]{.underline} power of the state to enter into
[[contract]{.underline}]{.mark}ual negotiations regarding specific
charges and a proposed sentence [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}, since the
1970 Brady v. United States opinion, [[been legitimated]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the [juridical coding of
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The specific [juridic code applied to
plea bargaining]{.underline} first [required]{.underline} the centuries-
long proliferation of an [ideological commitment [to **essentializing**
individ- ual autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}. As I demonstrated in Chapter
5, this occurred as part of a larger historical transformation in the
mode of production in the United States, one [[that positioned each
individual as]{.mark} the master of their own des- tiny]{.underline} --
**[[Homo economicus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The "free labor"
ideology]{.underline} that emerged during the mid-19th century
[demonstrated]{.underline} both a philosophical commitment to
privileging human agency and an [ideological justification for the
pursuit of political, economic, and cultural self-interest]{.underline}.
Serving as the Archimedean core, Article I §10, cl. 1, also known as the
"Contract Clause" of the United States Constitution, stipulates the
following: No state shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or
Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit
Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in
Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law
impairing the Obligations of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
(My emphasis.)1 As I sought to demonstrate in Chapter 5,
[the]{.underline} United States Supreme [Court]{.underline} further
[developed the essentializing power constituting the individual right to
contract]{.underline} through its 19th and early 20th-century common law
opinions. It was this important juridical and cultural emphasis upon
Homo sapiens as Homo economicus [that provided the hegemonic context
necessary to argue]{.underline}, as it did in Brady v. United States and
the other relevant 1970s plea cases discussed in Chapter 1, [that an
indicted felony criminal defendant may, if they choose (autonomy),
abdicate their constitutionally protected Fifth and Sixth Amendment
trial rights in exchange for a sentencing reduction]{.underline}. As
Chapter 4 made clear, the right to trial by jury was, until the mid-19th
century, viewed as a vital instrument of the judiciary, one that would
serve as a public check upon executive and legislative power. But for
ease of prosecution, certainty of outcome, and efficient use of scarce
resources, plea bargains emerged as an artifact of powerful state actors
-- including lawyers working in concert with captains of industry -- to
isolate and segment the mass of Americans who, like today, largely
operate outside the corridors of power. [Once successfully framed within
the discourse of Homo economicus, [Americans were suscepti- ble
to]{.mark} [being]{.mark} selectively preyed upon by political,
economic, and cultural forces that [isolated]{.mark} and separated them
[from each other]{.mark}, thereby **[discursively]{.mark}** [negat-
ing]{.mark} what had historically been [life]{.mark} lived [in
common]{.mark}]{.underline}. In sum, [[each American is perceived as an
**agent of their own making**]{.underline}]{.mark}, separated from their
community. Through [the]{.underline} process of
**[[valorizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the making and protection of
[[contracts]{.underline}]{.mark} in Article I §10 of the Constitution
and through Supreme Court case law, [com- bined with the successful
ideological construction of]{.underline} Homo sapiens as [Homo
economicus]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} legislative, executive, and
[judicial]{.underline} [branches]{.underline} have at their dis- posal
the structural legitimacy necessary to [[construct a legal
code]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., Federal Rule 11) [[in]{.mark} such [a
way]{.mark} that [the right to trial]{.mark} by jury has all but
**[disappeared]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this chapter, I will briefly
return to the liberty of contract doctrine to explore the two principal
ideological and political assumptions guiding it: individual autonomy
and efficiency. Next, I will discuss the application of conventional
contract law to plea bargaining by exploring concerns relating to
improperly obtained assent. Finally, I will introduce my argument that
plea bargaining signifies the confluence of conventional contract law
with contracts of adhesion. Liberty of Contract: Autonomy and Efficiency
The liberty of contract doctrine was and remains constituted by two pre-
vailing principles: 1) individual autonomy (liberty), and 2) efficiency.
As I will demonstrate, justifications for plea bargaining that rest upon
individual autonomy fail in two important ways. First, [[the notion of

Second, granting the existence of an autonomous individual as was and
continues to be the hegemonically rhetorical standard, plea bargaining
still fails by constitutional standards. I give primacy to the former
argument, and I jux- tapose the latter one to demonstrate what I
perceive to be a misapplication of constitutional law. Autonomy
Generally, from a moral and political philosophy perspective, we can
view autonomy as being comprised of two conditions -- competency and
authentic- ity.2 Competency refers to "various capacities for rational
thought, self-con- trol, freedom from debilitating pathologies, \[and\]
systematic self-deception ... Authenticity conditions often include the
capacity to reflect upon and endorse (or identify with) one's desires,
\[and\] values."3 Consistent with Homo economicus, "Autonomy is the
source of all obligations, whether moral or non-moral, since it is the
capacity to impose upon ourselves, by virtue of our practical
identities, obligations to act."4 [Viewing individuals as rational
economic maximizers is the premise]{.underline} of the Coase theorem,
the nucleus of the law and economics school of thought.5 Generally, the
Coase theorem posits individuals as rational cost calculators driven by
utility maximiza- tion. Moreover, "in virtually all economic accounts
... the individual is the fundamental unit of economic behavior ... The
interaction of rational indi- viduals, each maximizing his or her own
self-interest, tends toward market 'equilibrium' or steady state that
will not change in the absence of outside forces."6 Since markets are
solely produced through the interaction of self- interested individuals,
there is no need to consider politics, law, or culture as exogenous to
them and influential over them. As it pertains to plea bargaining,
Coase's theorem suggests that "[when parties are free to bargain
costlessly they will succeed in reaching efficient outcomes regardless
of the initial allocations of legal rights]{.underline}" (my empha-
sis).7 Law may be implicated in restoring system equilibrium under
circum- stances producing "transaction costs."8 Coase was primarily
concerned with acknowledging that every decision produces unanticipated
collateral effects. This is especially important as it pertains to my
argument in this book since, as Coase makes clear in his conclusion, It
would clearly be desirable if the only actions performed were those in
which what was gained was worth more than what was lost. But in choos-
ing between social arrangements within the context of which individual
decisions are made, we have to bear in mind that a change in the
existing system which will lead to an improvement in some decisions may
well lead to worsening of others.9 Of course, in the plea bargaining
context, transaction costs are transpar- ent and costly. They may be
experienced through the assertion of the right to trial where, upon
conviction, a defendant may be sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Or
perhaps transaction costs associated with the plea might entail
relinquishing access to government-funded housing, child care, or the
opportunity for employment. Most egregiously, the adoption of felony
crim- inal plea procedures with its emphasis on negotiated contracts
between a powerful representative of the government and a powerless
defendant, along with procedural rules barring access to impeachment
evidence known to the prosecutor (Ruiz) while requiring abdication of
Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, signifies the ultimate in transaction
costs -- the creation of a criminal procedure technology that presents
as a threat to democracy. Why? Through the legal coding of capitalism,
and consistent with Justice Harlan's contentions in Hopt and Thompson
that rights may not be taken away, nor given away (i.e., through waiver
of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment to plead), Coase's theorem and its
emphasis upon an autopoietic economic system of self-interested
individual utility maximizers leads to a broader sys- tem-wide
diminution of juridical rights protections. If the state may engage in
"trading" rights for a benefit (the commodification of rights), cherry-
picking rights protections from theoretically atomized individuals, then
the right no longer possesses the cultural, institutional, or
constitutional authority to protect people from the coercive power of
the state. Following Coase's theorem, so long as transaction costs are
kept to a minimum, and so long as there is "mutuality of benefit" (e.g.,
the state gains a conviction, the defendant receives downward departure
on sentencing), the accused who confronts the state is a "free agent"
possessing the "right" and "ability" to "knowingly" and "voluntarily"
negotiate the charges against them, and the subsequent punishment, but
only after abdicating their rights protections. While I contend that
this construction is mythological as applied to econom- ics, it is
perhaps not quite as dangerous to liberty as when it is applied to plea
bargaining. Liberalism's contribution to political philosophy and
autonomy was fundamental to the adoption of the liberty of contract
doctrine and the "freedom" to negotiate the terms of one's work.
Inherent in the liberty of contract doctrine is individual autonomy as a
prerequisite to forging the contracts integral to private law where
"mutual recognition or the equal- ity of persons is the necessary
condition for the correlation of rights and obligations in the private
legal relationship."10 But autonomy is also inte- gral to a commitment
to the social contract upon which liberal democracy would be formed.
Important for my purposes, "liberalism refers generally to that approach
to political power and social justice that determines prin- ciples of
right (justice) prior to, and largely independent of, determination of
conceptions of the good."11 Liberal conceptualization of autonomy is
integral to Homo economicus since it "implies the ability to reflect
wholly on oneself to accept or reject one's values, connections, and
self-defining features, and change such elements of one's life at
will."12 At bottom is the belief that individuals possess rights "by
virtue of their having some "prop- erty" (moral autonomy, human dignity)
that constitutes them as bearers of rights."13 As such, "Law and
political decisions are binding to the degree to which they respect
individual rights"14 since they signify expression of individual
autonomy. In sum, to be autonomous as envisioned by liberal theorists of
the Enlightenment period, or as we continue to hear from juridical
actors today, is to assume that Homo sapiens possesses an objective
awareness of self and others to such an extent that a "reasonable man"
will be able to properly comprehend and act in accordance with published
law.15 Consistent with this narrative, and with the exception of those
who are mentally compro- mised, [violation of the law is a choice made
by a reasonable rational actor who calculated the costs and benefits of
their actions and chose the illegal path]{.underline}. Arguing from
within the narrative of liberalism and moral philosophy, ascribing
autonomy to a defendant confronted with plea bargaining demon- strates
species respect for the individuality constituting Homo sapiens. That
is, providing a defendant with an option regarding their punishment for
charged crimes signifies acknowledgment that each of us has the capacity
to make "reasonable" decisions premised upon our objective assessment of
the circumstances we are confronting. It is precisely this kind of
justification for the plea that was provided by the Court in Brady and
its progeny. [[So long as there is a "mutuality of]{.mark}
[benefit]{.mark}" accruing to the state and to the defendant,
[and]{.mark} so long as the defendant has the [voluntary choice]{.mark}
to plead guilty or not guilty, then [the system preserves]{.mark} both
the [integrity]{.mark} of individual autonomy and system
efficiency]{.underline}. Such is the accepted wisdom of legal scholars
and practitioners, but for the reasons I present below, it is wrong.
Many years ago, while developing my ideas regarding the
constitutionality of the plea, I had an email exchange with Harvard Law
Professor Lawrence Tribe. Professor Tribe had read a short early draft
of my work, and while he agreed with me that there were problems
regarding plea procedure, he was not willing to concede my argument that
plea bargaining is per se unconsti- tutional. Specifically, Professor
Tribe said, I should say, however, that I don't agree with you that the
very notion of waiver of fundamental rights is somehow oxymoronic or
otherwise unacceptable ... I believe that the autonomy and independent
agency of supposedly free individuals ordinarily presupposes that they
should be able to "trade" otherwise fundamental rights in exchange for
benefits they desire more.16 Professor Tribe's emphasis upon individual
autonomy is the normative legal position, especially as it pertains to
plea bargaining. However, his position, like that of the legal
profession more generally, and the Supreme Court most specifically, is
simply at odds with what we know about how Homo sapiens comes to an
awareness of subjective identity. As I estab- lished in Chapter 5,
[notions of "freedom," "liberty," and "autonomy" con- stitute the
foundation of the liberty of contract doctrine, a doctrine that posits
each person as a reasonable and rational individual fully capable of
engaging in all social relationships as a "free agent]{.underline}." At
bottom, there is a Kantian presumption of free will.17 But as more than
[a century's worth of **[Sociology]{.mark}**]{.underline},18
**[[Psychology]{.underline}]{.mark}**,19

**[[Neuropsychology]{.underline}]{.mark}**,21 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[establishes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Homo sapiens]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} politically, economically, and culturally
**[[embedded subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}** constituted by their
respec- tive brains and experiences. That means that [no person has the
capacity to "step outside" of themselves in order to perceive the "world
as it is]{.underline}." This is because: a) [there is no "world as it
is," an objective reality signifying an overdetermined essentialism
available to all who are able to reason,]{.underline} and b) subjects
limited as they are by their own physiology and cultural expe- riences
(especially language)23 will always filter new information through their
political, economic, and cultural lenses. Moreover, each brain is a
snowflake,24 unique in its composition and its capacity for processing
infor- mation. Each brain symbiotically processes information consistent
with its cultural embeddedness, making the question of "choice" and
autonomy sus- pect. After all, "\[t\]he complex interactions of genes
and environment mean that all citizens---equal before the law---possess
different perspectives, dis- similar personalities, and varied
capacities for decision-making. The unique patterns of neurobiology
inside each of our heads cannot qualify as choices; these are the cards
we're dealt."25 Events and experiences occurring out- side a subject's
field of influence will not stimulate consciousness leading to action or
inaction in the same way that they would for those who are more familiar
with them. Three brief examples will suffice to establish the point: 1)
those who followed and continue to follow the autocratic white supremacy
of former president, Donald Trump; 2) those who follow and believe in
QAnon conspiracies; and 3) those Russians who believe Vladimir Putin's
"deNazification" rhetoric is a legitimate justification for war with
Ukraine. Limited as we are by our political, economic, and cultural
experi- ences, including the quality of information we receive, our
relative fear over the state of the country and our families, and the
precariousness of our lives, what is real and true will always be a
contested terrain of competing values and ideas, not something that
lives objectively "outside" of us. As it pertains to neuropsychology, a
subject far too complex to develop here, we know that for reasons
associated with species preservation, the Homo sapiens brain defaults to
the "fixation of belief" in original positions adopted by it.26 Homo
sapiens, then, is constituted by a complex and ongoing intersection of
political, economic, cultural, and neuropsychological factors that make
any argument for "free will" theoretically and empirically
anachronistic.27 In previous work deconstructing the knowing and
voluntary prongs of Federal Rule 11, I have emphasized the power of
neurophenomenology to provide a far more thorough assessment of
constituted subjects.28 Specifically, "It \[neurophenomenology\] seeks a
comprehensive understanding of human identity construction and
consciousness through integration of the natural and social sciences,
and phenomenology."29 Consider the following assess- ment of
neurophenomenology to embedded notions of autonomy, especially as
manifested in plea bargaining. What appears to be common among
neurophenomenologists, and that is especially significant as it pertains
to our concerns with mental compe- tency and plea bargaining, is
recognition that cognition and conscious- ness is a far more dynamic and
nuanced process than what the courts have generally understood. Common
among neurophenomenologists is the assumption that, "\[c\]onscious
experience is not located in a specific part of the brain, nor can it be
identified in terms of special neural struc- tures. It is an emergent
property of a particular cognitive process---the formation of transient
functional clusters of neurons." For Varela, "each conscious experience
is based on a specific cell assembly, in which many different neural
activities---associated with sensory perception, emotions, memory,
bodily movements, etc.---are unified into a transient but coher- ent
ensemble of oscillating neurons." Consciousness thereby manifests as the
confluence of a dynamic and emergent process combining neurologi- cal
networks with subjective environmental experiences.30 Much more could be
said with regard to the neurophenomenological cri- tique of free will
and the rational actor model that has constituted the crimi- nal legal
system since the Enlightenment. However, suffice it to say that the
[evidence exists from within the social sciences, neuroscience, and
phenom- enology that human subjects are anything but "autonomous,"
"reasonable," and "rational actors]{.underline}" confronting the
state.31 So why is it that the criminal legal system continues to cling
to an out- moded and simplistic framing of human consciousness? Because
[[presump- tions of]{.mark} "individual [autonomy]{.mark}" [serve as a
hegemonic rhetorical device]{.mark} [necessary for both the coding of
capital]{.mark} (e.g., freedom to work and to **[con- tract]{.mark}**)
[and for state-sanctioned governmentality through]{.mark} the
application of law (control over subject behavior, especially
[punishment]{.mark}). [To contend]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Professor
Tribe, the legal community, and certain state actors do, that [Americans
are autonomous]{.underline} [actors]{.underline} each capable of
confront- ing the state [on [equitable]{.mark} grounds in order to
[bargain]{.mark} for advantage [is]{.mark},]{.underline} [when
confronted with neurophenomenology, [a]{.mark} cynical **[straw
man]{.mark}** argument [useful for justifying]{.mark} the exercise of
[power]{.mark} over criminal defendants confronting the police power of
the state]{.underline}. I indicated in the opening paragraph of this
chapter that there were two reasons for rejecting the Court's
justification for the plea -- individ- ual autonomy was the first. The
second pertains to the positive right to a criminal trial by jury
expressed in Article III §2 and the Sixth Amendment. Assuming for the
moment that Homo sapiens is a species capable of "indi- vidual
autonomy," I find the argument for the constitutionality of plea bar-
gaining still fails to convince. As discussed in Chapter 4, Article III
§2 and the Sixth Amendment were crafted precisely to protect liberal
notions of individual autonomy against an overpowering judging and
punishing state. That is, just as Justice Harlan explained in Hopt and
Thompson, as well as the constitutional protections afforded by the
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth
Amendments, presuppose an autono- mous actor confronted by the police
and prosecutorial power of the state. With the exception of the Sixth
Amendment, those protections were largely assumed to be negative rights
that limited how far the state could go to intrude upon individual
(autonomous) liberty. To summarize, while I con- tend consistent with
the published neurophenomenological scholarship that no Homo sapiens is
an island unto itself, rather that each is constituted by its
neurological soundness and cultural embeddedness, even if I were to con-
cede the autonomous actor argument consistent with the Constitution,
Bill of Rights, and Reconstruction Amendments, it is clear that the
dignity of the subject confronted with state authority is embedded in
each. Law and Efficiency

Legal scholars of the Progressive era applied the theory of marginal
util- ity to the accumulation of wealth. The argument was simple enough.
For the wealthy, the accumulation of an additional dollar will generate
only "marginal utility" since a dollar added to hundreds of thousands or
mil- lions of dollars already procured will not significantly enhance
their qual- ity of life. However, for the poor, every additional dollar
accumulated does significantly enhance their quality of life, and in so
doing, the overall health of the national economy. According to marginal
utility theory, "the transfer of dollars from the millionaire to the
pauper would continue to improve total welfare until the millionaire and
the pauper had the same amount of marginal utility for the next
dollar."46 The redistributive nature of Progressive marginal utility
theory led to its practitioners being referred to as the material
welfare school of economics. The material welfare school was influential
from the turn of the 20th century until 1930.47 Hovenkamp states that
the material welfare school influenced the jurisprudence of tort law,
family law, environmental law, criminal law, and civil rights law.48
They supported the application of marginal utility economics to a vast
array of policies and practices meant to counteract the well-known
detritus gener- ated by the capitalist mode of production, including
"minimum wage laws, graduated income taxes, subsidized public education,
welfare payments to the poor, taxes on monopoly profits, and other
devices by which the rela- tively wealthy were required to finance the
provision of goods and services to the relatively impoverished. Health
and safety regulation could also be justified as taxes on wealthy
producers for the benefit of poorer consum- ers."49 With its attention
to the degradation of human life generated through oppressive living and
working conditions, the material welfare school of economics responded
with policies that, in my opinion, seem consistent with those
recommended by the physiocrats discussed previously. The phys- iocrats,
you may recall, were foremost in promoting the natural law ideol- ogy of
individual autonomy consistent with the application of property and the
right to freely labor. They were also well aware of the abject suffering
of the laboring poor and argued for policies that would ameliorate it.
The Progressive era material welfare school applied marginal utility to
a set of policies designed to protect the poor and vulnerable through
the redistribu- tion of wealth. Richard T. Ely was a progressive law and
economics scholar writing in the early to mid-20th century. He was, like
many of his predecessors, heav- ily influenced by the German Historical
School of economics. I mention Ely because his analysis is both
historical and structural in nature, and because of his analysis of
contracts. In 1914, Ely published his two-volume Property and Contract
in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth. An institu- tionalist
economist by training, Ely "argued that the distribution of wealth in
society was a product of previously created legal rules, not merely that
of the natural laws of economics" (my emphasis).50 That is, no
"invisible hand" drove economic prosperity. Rather, individual wealth
was established and maintained through a series of legal codes (recall
Katharina Pistor and the coding of capital) produced by those with
access to power. Important for my purposes is Ely's concern with
contract law. Ely insists that [**unregulated** bargaining enhances
power that already exists and creates increasingly greater
economic]{.underline} [inequality]{.underline}. [The law of contract
tends to pre- serve advantages once secured, because the inequalities of
disadvantages under which one party may labor will express themselves in
contract]{.underline}. And [as contract tends to preserve advantages
secured, so it continues dis- advantages -- contract tends to keep the
existing conditions of things, or to allow existing currents to flow
on]{.underline}.51 [As applied to plea bargaining, Ely's expression of
the power vested in the progenitor of contracts (i.e., a prosecutor),
and the sempiternal application of plea procedure as a contractual
bargain, signify a self-contained autopoi- etic process that over time
constructs its own internal logic]{.underline}. Importantly, to the
extent that there is no substantive systemic oversight of prosecuto-
rial authority in the context of the plea (recall Federal Rule 11), the
process shares similarities with Ely's larger concern over "unregulated
bargaining." In addition, Ely's contention that it is [the contract as
legal technology that facilitates the perpetuation of the inequalities
and disadvantages that exist between the author of a contract (a
prosecutor) and its recipient (a defend- ant)]{.underline} is precisely
the point that I am making in this chapter. What [[prosecutors
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} [[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the
application of contract law to [[plea negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}
is: a) normalizing the hierarchical authority of the state in the person
of the pros- ecutor, b) [**[legitimating]{.mark}** the application of
[contract law to criminal procedure]{.mark}]{.underline}, c) [[promoting
Homo economicus]{.mark}, [the **atomized** rational individual]{.mark}
confront- ing the state]{.underline}, d) [[efficiency and ease of
conviction]{.underline}]{.mark}, and e) autopoietic normali- zation of
the plea process. The practical result of [[the]{.underline}
[normalization of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the application of [contract law
to plea bargains is]{.mark}, as Ely suggests the "[preserva- tion of
advantages secured]{.mark}" for the powerful, while contracts continue
[to promote disadvantages for the powerless since]{.mark} [they]{.mark}
tend to [perpetuate the "condition of things]{.mark}]{.underline}." In
sum, for Ely it is [[contract]{.underline}]{.mark} as legal technology
that [serves]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [**[perpetuate]{.underline}**
[unequal bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}. This point will become clearer
as I discuss contracts of adhesion below. Beginning in 1970 and
continuing throughout the decade, neoclassical (or neoliberal) economics
began to take hold with its primary emphasis on a reinterpretation of
common law (judge-made law) to emphasize efficiency, where the common
law was considered more desirable than legislation for promoting
individual wealth and societal well-being.
[[Neoliberal]{.underline}]{.mark} economists considered common law
superior to legislation for two reasons. First, "com- mon [[law is
designed to give effect]{.mark} [to private bargains with
minimum]{.mark} active [interference from the state" because the
"invisible hand" of the market was]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[more
efficient]{.underline}]{.mark} mechanism for determining resource
allocations. Second, "common law rules tend to become precedential only
to the extent that they are efficient -- i.e., through an evolutionary
process, more efficient rules are upheld while less efficient ones are
overruled."52 [What I find compelling is the emerging]{.underline}
confluence of [neoliberal economics during the 1970s with the United
States Supreme Court opinions relating to plea bargaining]{.underline}.
As I emphasized in Chapter 1, a brief review of the Court's 1970s plea
jurisprudence makes it clear that the Court's majority had been
influenced by an enervated liberty of contract doctrine that emerged
largely in response to the publication of Coase's 1960 article. As
applied to the plea, [the Court's language speaks specifically to
procedural efficiency by framing criminal defendants as atomized
individuals subject to the power of]{.underline} government through the
office of [the prosecutor]{.underline}. [The historical
timing]{.underline} of the Court's plea jurisprudence [with an emergent
neoliberal law and economy movement cannot be overlooked]{.underline}.
There are two prevailing theories applied to questions of efficiency and
that are normative within law and economics -- the Pareto efficiency
princi- ple and the Kaldor--Hicks efficiency principle. The Pareto
efficiency principle (which ultimately leads to the development of the
Coase theorem) stipulates that "a policy is efficient if there is no
alter- native policy that makes someone better off without making anyone
worse off (what Coase referred to as 'transaction costs')."53 The
ultimate Pareto achievement is equilibrium, the balancing of interests.
In order for a policy to be Pareto efficient, "a state policy may be
said to increase welfare only if at least one person subjectively
perceived that he benefitted and no one sub- jectively perceived that
she was injured."54 In the 1930s, marginal utility theory met with
severe opposition from ordinal economics. Rather than emphasizing class
as an independent vari- able affecting all manner of human behavior,
ordinal economics assessed individual preferences for, say, commodity
purchases, by ranking them on an ordinal scale. Ordinal efficiency
analysis most commonly appears in the form of the Kaldor-Hicks
efficiency principle. Nicholas Kaldor and John R. Hicks conceived an
efficiency principle that would embellish upon Pareto efficiency. [The
Kaldor--Hicks]{.underline} [efficiency principle posits]{.underline}
that [the most effi- cient policy is the one that people are most
willing to pay for.]{.underline}55 That is, a law or procedure is
Kaldor--Hicks efficient, not when relationships are in equipoise as with
Pareto efficiency, but rather when the [beneficiaries]{.underline} of an
agreement "[are able to compensate the losers fully for their losses and
still have something left over]{.underline}" (my emphasis).56 Axiomatic
of contractual nego- tiations, Kaldor--Hicks efficiency acknowledges
that there will be "winners" and "losers." This is most likely to be
true under circumstances where con- tracts of adhesion (discussed below)
are in play since [[a]{.mark} clear **[power imbal- ance]{.mark}**
[exists]{.mark} between the author of the negotiation and those to whom
the terms of the contract will be applied]{.underline}. Plea bargaining
is Kaldor--Hicks efficient. It is my argument that to the extent the
question of efficiency is paramount for legal scholars and mem- bers of
the judiciary who defend the contractual nature of plea bargain- ing, it
is the [Kaldor--Hicks efficiency]{.underline} principle that most
clearly [encapsulates]{.underline} [the post-indictment plea
agreement]{.underline} between a prosecutor and a defendant. Unlike
Pareto efficiency, which tolerates a unit of improvement for one sub-
ject so long as, in accruing that unit of improvement, no other subject
is harmed, the criminal legal process may be considered Kaldor--Hicks
effi- cient when [one subject receives a unit of improvement at the
expense of the other subject, but [the other subject is compensated for
their loss]{.mark}]{.underline}. As applied to the administration of
justice through plea bargaining, [prosecutors "win" by gaining an
admission of guilt from a defendant who must also abdi- cate their Fifth
and Sixth Amendment rights (i.e., their losses), while those defendants
are "compensated" for their loss]{.underline} (abdication of Fifth and
Sixth Amendment rights) [through]{.underline} receipt of [charge and
sentencing reductions]{.underline}. So while [the plea process fails to
produce equitable contractual outcomes]{.underline}, it is Kaldor--Hicks
efficient since it satisfies the needs of the state (a unit of
improvement) while simultaneously compensating defendants for their
deci- sion to forego trial. In summary, the law and economics movement
in the United States has a fascinating and bipolar history. Initially
forming in response to the deleteri- ous effects of capitalism, early
material welfare school economists apply- ing marginal utility theory
turned to the state for regulation of industrial practices. The
influence of the material welfare school began to wane in the 1930s, and
by the 1970s the United States was firmly in the grip of neolib- eral
economic theory -- a return to classical economics with its emphasis on
deregulation of industry and the free labor liberty of contract language
that generated Homo economicus. The 1970s economic turn emerged at pre-
cisely the same moment as the plea bargaining cases presented in Chapter
1 were decided by the United States Supreme Court. The Kaldor--Hicks
effi- ciency principle provided the theoretical and juridical
justification for a con- stitutionally protected form of due process --
plea bargaining -- substantively codified through a legal code of
capitalism -- Rule 11. Plea Bargaining and Improperly Obtained Assent

Piketty is acknowledging the historical contingency constituting the
legal coding of capital, especially Foucault's emphasis upon law as an
instrument of power ("that is neither the truth of power, nor its
alibi"). His argument, like Pistor's (and Foucault developed in Chapter
7), insists upon the his- torical autonomy of actors and institutions.
The importance of this framing of political, economic, and cultural
arrangements is historically analogous to a semi-permeable membrane that
both restricts and provides cleavages that enable the manifestation of
new ideas about ways of organizing our- selves. For, as Piketty rightly
observes, "At every level of development, eco- nomic, social, and
political systems can be structured in many different ways; property
relations can be organized differently; different fiscal and educational
regimes are possible; problems of public and private debt can be handled
differently."94 The legal coding of capital that emerges in the United
States in the early 19th century originates within an ideological con-
text that Piketty calls "slave society," which he equates with a
historical period of extreme inequality premised upon the
"quasi-sacrilization of pri- vate property in the nineteenth century."95
The American ideological com- mitment to the system of slavery grew
increasingly profitable and remained relatively stable from 1800 to
1860. Restrictions in cotton production in the French colony of
Saint-Domingue in 1790 stimulated interest in the Southern United States
cotton production market. According to Piketty, from 1800 to 1860 the
number of slaves increased by a factor of four, and cotton output by
ten.96 The recursive relationship between British textile manufacturing
and American cotton production was so extensive that just prior to the
commencement of the Civil War, Britain was purchasing 75 per- cent of
its cotton from the United States.97 Why does this matter? Because it
was this political, economic, and cultural nexus, contextualized by the
ideology of slavery and aided by coded capital, that combined to lead to
the commencement of the Industrial Revolution. The sustained growth of
the Southern plantation economy, however, would by 1860 begin to con-
front a juvenescent wage labor economy emerging in the manufacturing
sec- tors of the North. Northern economic power, while more diversified
than in the South, parasitically fed upon Southern slavery through a
system of bank loans made to Southern plantation owners seeking funds to
purchase new slaves. In fact, not only did the commodification of
agriculture and technology create new financial instruments, but as
Beckert and Rockman establish, "\[T\]he story of plantation finance ...
\[added\] a second layer of commodities -- enslaved human beings -- to
the nation's financial history."98 Loans were made to plantation owners
with slaves used as collateral. Those funds would then be used to
purchase additional land and slaves.99 So prof- itable was the cotton
production trade that during the late 1830s the most powerful banks in
the United States -- Barings, Browns, and Rothschilds -- each made
significant loans to Southern plantations. Beckert and Rockman argue
that the practice of implementing lending instruments supporting cot-
ton production enabled it to facilitate trade with Great Britain,
France, and Germany.100 When it came to slavery, there appeared to be
few unstained regions of the country. The slave trade grew so profitable
that in 1860, "the market value of slaves exceeded 250 percent of the
annual income of the Southern states and came close to 100 percent of
the annual income of all the states."101 Moreover, when compared with
wage laborers in the North, "the market price of a slave was generally
about ten to twelve years of an equivalent free worker's wages."102 Such
was the political, economic, and cultural context of the Antebellum
South, which recoiled when confronted with President Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation, Reconstruction, the Reconstruction
Amendments, and the Northern-inspired wage labor movement. [[As a
participant]{.mark} in the making of contractual relationships, [each
individ- ual was embodied as an agent of their]{.mark} own circumstance
and [choosing]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a linguistic and juridical
expression of human freedom, liberty of contract possessed, as its
highest virtue, its dialectical opposition to prior modes of production
under slavery, feudalism, and indentured servitude. Moreover, in the
United States, the liberty of contract doctrine was intricately bound up
with the manifestation of liberal [economic and political
theory]{.underline} comprising a constitutional republic wherein
[normative legal coding provided for the **supremacy of**
**contract**]{.underline} and protection of private property.
[[The]{.mark} **[myth]{.mark}**ological American origin story
[presents]{.mark}]{.underline} individualism, [private
rights]{.underline}, civil society, [free labor]{.underline}, [and [a
free economy as constitutive of American
exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[a "natural"]{.mark} [outgrowth of
a people unfettered by the]{.mark} intrusion of an oppres- sive
[state]{.mark}]{.underline}.103 Law's hegemonic function legitimates
state power and authority,104 espe- cially United States Supreme Court
opinions.105 By doing so, [it generates a sense of normativity (what
ought to happen) with regard to the principles articulated by statutes
and case law]{.underline}. [This sense of [normativity leaves the
purpose behind plea bargaining open to
**obfuscation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. How? [[By locating the privilege
to plea bargain within the language of Homo economicus]{.underline} --
[free choice]{.underline}]{.mark}, i.e., [[the right to engage in
contractual negotiations over one's punish-
ment]{.underline}]{.mark}.106 [[This]{.underline}
**[superficially]{.underline}** "**[free]{.underline}**]{.mark}"
[[choice is couched in the economic language of liberty of
contract]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [mandate]{.underline} under a
capitalist mode of production for each member of society [[to]{.mark}
[negotiate]{.mark} the [terms]{.mark} of their own working rela-
tionship]{.underline}. In previous work on this subject,107 I have
provided the following assessment of Homo economicus. [Homo
economicus]{.underline} -- economic man -- of classical economic theory
is said to [possess the]{.underline} following
[characteristics]{.underline}: "(1) [maximizing (optimiz- ing)
behavior;]{.underline} (2) [the cognitive ability to exercise rational
choice]{.underline}; (3) indi- vidualistic behavior and independent
taste preferences." A less charitable description of homo economicus
might frame him as being "cold and calculating, worries only about
himself, and pursues whatever course brings him the greatest material
advantage." Homo economicus is a single-minded, wealth-maximizing
automaton, who does not take into account "morality, ethics, or other
people." Important for our purposes, the adoption of [the ideological
rationalization of human beings as homo economicus leads to confronting
juridical problems through the applica- tion of cost-benefit analysis,
where solutions are framed as incentives and disincentives]{.underline}.
[[The framing]{.mark} of homme juridique as [homo economicus pro- vides
the jurisprudential legitimization for plea
bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}.108 In some ways, it is true that the
ability to negotiate the conditions of one's own labor and compensation
required a larger political and ideological com- mitment to liberty as
expressed through republican government. The two, it seems, historically
went hand in hand, especially in the United States. What is not
discussed in the context of plea bargaining is the extent to which
capitalists and politicians employed law in the service of their own
profit- maximizing needs, social control, and expressions of cultural
superiority.109 For W.E.B. Du Bois, the onset of industrial capitalism
meant the oppression of all workers regardless of race/ethnicity. The
new industry had a vision not of work but of wealth; not of planned
accomplishment, but of power. It became the most conscienceless, unmoral
system of industry which the world has experienced. It went with
ruthless indifference towards waste, death, ugliness and disaster, and
yet reared the most stupendous machine for the efficient organization of
work which the world has ever seen.110 [[American ideology **mystifies**
the power of the state to regulate private and public relations by
"downplay\[ing\]]{.mark} the more [historical]{.mark} and 'artificial'
[role of]{.mark} collective decision-making, public law, government, and
regulation in American political-economic development]{.underline}."111
[Counter to mythological rhetorical expressions of laissez-faire
capitalism]{.underline}, for example, [19th-century governmentality
was]{.underline} so **[pervasive]{.underline}**, argues Shaw, that "the
one common and striking characteristic of this huge collection of new
\[19th century\] statutes is its utter disregard of the laissez-faire
principle."112 The state has at its com- mand the power to create the
legal tools that lawyers apply to political and economic regulation and
the power necessary to coerce adherence to those regulations. The
indeterminate and contested relationship between system reproduction and
law must be revealed through historically situated statu- tory and case
law research. Consider the role played by the United States Supreme
Court, functioning as a system-reproducing steering mechanism to
perpetuate the capitalist mode of production by reference to the liberty
of contract doctrine. While the liberty of contract doctrine was at
least initially developed and implemented in the nascent industrial
economy of the North, from its founding as a nation the United States
coded slavery and subsequent white supremacy into law governing freed
men and women in the South. As we have learned, the liberty of contract
doctrine manifested in the South dur- ing Reconstruction, especially as
it related to the abolition of plantation paternalism. According to the
doctrine, freed men and women would now be viewed as similarly situated
to wage labor workers in the North insofar as their status related to
the application of the fellow-servant rule, assumption of risk doctrine,
and freedom to contract for work. But as was revealed in the previous
section of this chapter, in addition to their new status as wage
laborers, freed men and women would confront the vulgarity and indignity
of white supremacy as coded into the law of Southern capitalism. It is
in this way that the Southern power bloc comprising producers of cotton,
food, tur- pentine, coal, tobacco, textiles, and lumber engineered a
system of political, economic, and cultural oppression that relied upon
the semiotic construc- tion of a legal code consistent with capitalism's
slavery -- Jim Crow laws. In dialectical opposition to the liberty of
contract doctrine, we find Marxist economic theory. In the section to
follow, I will present a brief over- view of Marx's theory of value
since it presents a theory of human thriving at odds with the evolution
of liberal economics and with natural law's physi- ocratic emphasis upon
individual autonomy. As we will see, this is impor- tant because Marx
was able to articulate a theory of the economy and the state that
exposed [the legal coding of capital as an oppressive move that would
have dramatic effects well beyond the economic sphere]{.underline}.
Moreover, and in keeping with the political economy theme of this book,
Marx's the- ory exposes the intersection of the capitalist mode of
production with the need to discipline wage labor to the dictates of
profit maximization. This section will provide the context for the
substantive deconstruction of con- tract law as applied to the plea,
where beginning during Reconstruction, the plea served as an efficient
legal technology for promoting social control over white and black wage
laborers in both the North and the South. Marx's Theory of Value and the
Coding of Capital

#### Utilitarian centric punishment causes the commodification of justice and abstraction of suffering, allowing "objective" utility maximization that causes predictive policing and racial subjugation

Form," Journal of Law and Political Economy,

IV\. Second-Order Commodification: Punishment-Utility Equivalence
Pashukanis hoped that, in transcending the bourgeois legal form, the
Soviet Union could succeed in \"transforming punishment from retribution
into a measure of expediency for the protection of society and into the
reform of individuals who are a threat to society\" (Pashukanis \[1924\]
2003, 185). In this section, however, I argue that such
[[consequentialist]{.mark} [approaches]{.mark} to
punishment]{.underline}, no less than retributive ones, [[are rooted in
commodification]{.underline}-]{.mark}in this case, [[through the
mediating]{.mark} value [of]{.mark} [social
utility]{.mark}]{.underline}. I refer to this punishment-utility
equivalence as the second-order commodification ofjustice. It
corresponds to the second aspect of **[commodified
justice]{.underline}**, [whereby appropriate response to believed
wrongdoing itself has quantifiable value]{.underline}. The canonical
statement of the utilitarian theory of punishment comes from Jeremy
Bentham. [Unlike the retributivists]{.underline} discussed above, who
locate the justness of a punishment in its relationship to a specific
wrongful act, **[Bentham]{.underline}** [argues]{.underline} that
[punishment is justified to the extent that it brings about an increase
in total social utility by optimizing punishment\'s role as a
deterrent]{.underline}. He writes: \"\[T\]he general object which all
laws have, or ought to have, in common, is [to augment the total
happiness of the community]{.underline}; and therefore, in the first
place, to exclude, as far as may be, anything that tends to subtract
from that happiness\" (Bentham \[1789\] 2011, 57). Because both crime
and punishment tend to subtract from the total happiness, punishment is
\"only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater
evil\" (ibid.). [Crime and punishment]{.underline}, therefore,
[are]{.underline} both [reckoned against another \"universal
equivalent\"-utility for]{.underline} [society]{.underline}. [The
Benthamite lawmaker must quantify crime and punishment in these terms so
as to calibrate the latter for maximal total utility]{.underline}. [This
is the]{.underline} conceptual **[core]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} second-order [commodification of justice]{.underline}.
At first, this second-order commodification might seem mutually
exclusive with the first-order commodification described above.
Punishment is no longer \"bought\" by offending, nor is offending \"paid
for\" by punishment; both acts retain their independence and are
considered from a social perspective in light of their use-values-their
utility/disutility for the broader community. However, a closer look at
Bentham\'s theory suggests less an elimination of first-order
commodification than its displacement from the law itself to the minds
of the individuals it governs. Bentham\'s first rule for penal
legislation is that \"the value of the punishment must not be less in
any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of theprofit of the
offence\" (ibid., 63; emphasis in the original). The efficacy of
[[Bentham]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} [theory]{.underline}, then, [depends
on the extent to which a given [offense]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
possibility of a corresponding [punishment are legible as commodities to
individuals]{.mark}, such that [they can weigh their relative \"values\"
and maximize their overall \"profit]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Moreover,
[as]{.underline} it is [the [law]{.mark} that [will specify]{.mark}
punishments so that [individuals will recognize criminal actions as
**unprofitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [its makers must]{.underline}
also [engage in this commodification, at least as a theoretical
exercise, so as to set those punishments at appropriate
levels]{.underline}. Hence the \"second- order\" character of this
strain of [commodified justice]{.underline}: it
**[presumes]{.underline}** first-order [commodification in concept-that
offense and punishment can be equated-and seeks to quantitatively
valorize different prospective offense-punishment equilibria against
each other through the medium of utility.]{.underline} Cesare Beccaria,
another Enlightenment-era penologist of utilitarian leanings, usefully
links these ideas, albeit in reverse order: \"the obstacles that deter
men from committing crimes must be more formidable the more those crimes
are contrary to the public good and the greater are the incentives to
commit them. Thus, there must be proportion between crimes and
punishments\" (Beccaria \[1764\] 2008, 17). Much like retributivist
ideas, Benthamite principles of crime and punishment also saw a
resurgence around the 1970s, most prominently in Gary Becker\'s (1968)
landmark article \"Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach,\" and the
broader Law and Economics movement this article helped to launch.
Indeed, Richard Posner, perhaps the best-known exponent of this mode of
legal thought, subtitled a descriptive essay on it \"from Bentham to
Becker\" (Posner 2001, 31-61).8 For Becker, who saw himself as
\"resurrect\[ing\]\" and \"moderniz\[ing\]\" [the economic-minded
penology]{.underline} of Beccaria and Bentham (Becker 1968, 209),
[utility provides the law not only a metric to assign proper punishments
to categories of offenses but, more broadly, away to reckon the value of
punishment in general against other government projects, given costs and
resource scarcity]{.underline}. Becker announces his aims thusly: The
main purpose of this essay is to answer . . . [how many resources and
how much punishment should be used to enforce]{.underline} different
kinds of [legislation]{.underline}? Put equivalently, although more
strangely, [how many offenses should be permitted and how many offenders
should go unpunished]{.underline}? [The method]{.underline} used
[formulates a measure of the **social loss** from offenses and finds
those expenditures of resources and punishments that minimize this
loss]{.underline}. (Becker, 170; emphasis in the original) While the
retributive theorist and Benthamite legislator, each in their own way,
concern themselves with the proper rate of exchange between crime and
punishment, [Becker is]{.underline} primarily [occupied
with]{.underline} another kind of [exchange: that of punishment for
other prospective social goods, given that resources are
finite.]{.underline} [[Expenditures]{.mark} on punishment [are]{.mark}
to be set so as to [minimize]{.mark} \"[the social loss]{.mark} from
offenses]{.underline}.\" This requires that these
[expenditures]{.underline}, and the gains they may bring[, be precisely
quantified in terms of this social loss, a \"universal equivalent\"
capable of bridging all other possible resource
expenditures]{.underline}, penal and otherwise. With Becker, then, the
second-order commodification of justice is articulated in its most
complete form: [the commodification of justice as the output of an
overall penal regime, [evaluated with]{.mark} attention to its
[operating and **opportunity**]{.mark} **[costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
None of the above is to say that second-order commodification is
restricted to utilitarian theories, even if it does find its
paradigmatic statement therein. Retributivism, too, as Richard Lippke
convincingly argues, is necessarily subject to second-order
commodification, since retribution also inevitably occurs against a
background of resource scarcity and necessary trade-offs (Lippke 2019).
[It costs money to punish, so [punishment itself must be
assigned]{.mark} explicit [value]{.mark} in a manner [that allows
for]{.mark} [comparisons]{.mark} [with other]{.mark} prospective [uses
for]{.mark} that [money]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most retributive theorists
do not weigh such issues, but applying their theories in practice
demands at least implicit efforts to do so (ibid., 55-56). Both first-
and second-order commodification, then, can be found in at least some
proportion in penal regimes animated by either utilitarian or
retributive principles. This second-order commodification has also done
a great deal to shape criminal justice policy in the United States over
the past half-century. If [the retributive shift of the
**1970s**]{.underline} helped spell the end of the \"clinical\" model of
punishment, in which sentences were determined by the \"subjective
judgment of experienced decision-makers\" (Harcourt 2007, 269 n. 48),
mindful of rehabilitation, it also [cleared ground for new
consequentialist forms of penality to emerge in an
\"actuarial\'guise]{.underline}, [characterized by
\"[stat]{.mark}istical [correlations between]{.mark} [group traits
and]{.mark} group criminal [offending]{.mark}
[rates]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (ibid., 18). [In [seek]{.mark}ing [to
**predict**]{.mark} [crime and]{.mark}/or [recidivism]{.mark}, such
methods serve an end only thinkable in the wake of the second-order
commodification of justice: to make effective punishment optimally
cost-efficient, to \"buy\" as much as possible for the least expense in
utility elsewhere]{.underline}. Indeed, such [actuarial methods lie at
the core of \"predictive policing]{.underline},\" now common in
departments across the country, whereby [police employ advanced
analytics to determine precisely where they should devote resources and
when]{.underline}. Second-order [[commodification]{.mark} also
[contributes to]{.mark} the **racism** that pervades American penal law
at every level. Many have critiqued **[predictive policing]{.mark}** for
[justifying racist patterns]{.mark} of policing [under the guise of
objective utility]{.mark} [maximization]{.mark}]{.underline} (Harcourt
2007, 147-168; Wang 2018, 247-250; Jefferson 2018; Browning and Arrigo,
2021). [[Race]{.mark}, by statistical proxies like geography or by
structuring uneven patterns of surveillance that **[skew
sampling]{.mark}**, figures as an **implicit input** in a grand,
Beckerian calculus, [determining the precise exchange-value]{.mark} of
various police actions]{.underline}. Such [an operation [yields a
**veneer** **of**]{.mark} formal **[neutrality]{.mark}**-now
understandable as an effect of the abstraction of the commodity
form-which produces]{.underline} what Naomi Murakawa and Katherine
Beckett have called \"[[the **penology of racial
innocence**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" whereby \"the operation of racial
power in penal practices and institutions\" is \"obscure\[d\]\"
(Murakawa and Beckett 2010, 696). And in turn[, mass criminalization
plays a constitutive role in the construction of race more
broadly]{.underline} (Van Cleve and Mayes 2015). Indeed, Henry Louis
Gates takes Posner to task, specifically, for neglecting the
\"**[[racial stigmata]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[imposed on]{.mark} all
[Black people]{.mark}, not just those who suffer from specific
discrimination, in [perceiving]{.mark} them [in terms of their]{.mark}
[probability of committing a crime]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gates 1992,
337-341, quote on 341). Such \"stigmata,\" of course, were not first
fashioned by Law and Economics scholars; Khalil Gibran Muhammad has
argued [that the \"[stat]{.mark}istical [language]{.mark}\" of social
science [played a **crucial** role in producing the]{.mark} popular
association between [Blackness and criminality]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the United States as early as the late nineteenth century (Muhammad
2011, 1). In any case, [this bidirectional relationship between racism
and legal punishment seems reinforced by the second-order
commodification of the latter; [it **launders** racism in]{.mark}
[stat]{.mark}istical [generality]{.mark}, [allowing]{.mark} [its
particulars to disappear into the]{.mark} apparent [objectivity of
quantity]{.mark}]{.underline}. First- and second-order commodification
are distinct, to be sure, but they can also operate in tandem. Such is
the case in the institution of plea bargaining-a ubiquitous practice in
American penal law, used to resolve an overwhelming majority of cases.
Robert E. Scott and William J. Stuntz, who explicitly analogize the
practice of plea bargaining to contractual exchange, provide a succinct
summary of this practice and its significance: Most cases are disposed
of by means that seem scandalously casual: a quick conversation in a
prosecutor\'s office or a courthouse hallway between attorneys familiar
with only the basics of the case, with no witnesses present, leading to
a proposed resolution that is then \"sold\" to both the defendant and
the judge. To a large extent, this kind of horse-trading determines who
goes to jail and for how long. That is what plea bargaining is. It is
not some adjunct to the criminal justice system; it is the criminal
justice system. (Scott and Stuntz 1992, 1911-1912)

#### Plea bargaining is commodity fetishism based on abstractions of suffering, punishment debt, guilt/innocence uncertainty, a cruel optimism of seeking to quantify all aspects to maximize justice while simultaneously negating it

Second-order commodification also contributes to the racism that
pervades American penal law at every level. Many have critiqued
predictive policing for justifying racist patterns of policing under the
guise of objective utility maximization (Harcourt 2007, 147-168; Wang
2018, 247-250; Jefferson 2018; Browning and Arrigo, 2021). Race, by
statistical proxies like geography or by structuring uneven patterns of
surveillance that skew sampling, figures as an implicit input in a

various police actions. Such an operation yields a veneer of formal
neutrality-now understandable as an effect of the abstraction of the
commodity form-which produces what Naomi Murakawa and Katherine Beckett
have called \"the penology of racial innocence,\" whereby \"the

\"obscure\[d\]\" (Murakawa and Beckett 2010, 696). And in turn, mass
criminalization plays a constitutive role in the construction of race
more broadly (Van Cleve and Mayes 2015). Indeed, Henry Louis Gates takes

committing a crime (Gates 1992, 337-341, quote on 341). Such
\"stigmata,\" of course, were not first fashioned by Law and Economics
scholars; Khalil Gibran Muhammad has argued that the \"statistical
language\" of social science played a crucial role in producing the
popular association between Blackness and criminality in the United
States as early as the late nineteenth century (Muhammad 2011, 1). In
any case, this bidirectional relationship between racism and legal
punishment seems reinforced by the second-order commodification of the
latter; it launders racism in statistical generality, allowing its
particulars to disappear into the apparent objectivity of quantity.
First- and second-order [commodification]{.underline} are distinct, to
be sure, but they can also [operate in]{.underline}
[tandem]{.underline}. Such is the case [in the institution of plea
bargaining-a ubiquitous practice in American penal law, used to resolve
an overwhelming majority of cases]{.underline}. Robert E. Scott and
William J. Stuntz, who explicitly analogize the practice of [[plea
bargaining]{.mark} to]{.underline} contractual exchange, provide a
succinct summary of this practice and its significance: Most [[cases are
disposed]{.mark} of by means that seem]{.underline} **[[scandalously

familiar]{.underline} [with only the **basics**]{.underline} of [the

is not some adjunct to the criminal justice system; it is the criminal
justice system. (Scott and Stuntz 1992, 1911-1912) [[A]{.mark} given
[offense has its]{.mark} specific \"[price]{.mark}\" [in]{.mark} the
form of its [standard punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[this]{.underline} first-order [[commodification]{.mark} defines the
initial \"holdings\" of the two parties; it [provides the context for
bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Against]{.underline}]{.mark} this
backdrop, as well as [the [uncertainty]{.mark} associated [with]{.mark}
going to [trial]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[parties engage
in]{.mark}]{.underline} a kind of
**[[speculation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [bargaining away their chance at
the best possible outcome in order to mitigate the chance of the
worst]{.underline} (ibid., 1914). [Practiced [attorneys]{.mark} learn
to]{.underline} [[recognize the \"**market
price**]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [of a particular case]{.underline}
(1923), [leading to swift bargains]{.underline}, or what is sometimes
referred to, revealingly for our purposes, as \"assembly line justice\"
(Blumberg 1969, 22). Indeed, while justice by [[plea]{.mark}
[bargain]{.mark}]{.underline} may seem in one sense a departure from
first-order commodification-it [distorts the \"price\" deemed
appropriate in the law-in another sense it is a furtherance thereof,
[commodifying crime]{.mark} [not only in]{.mark} cases of [demonstrated
guilt, but]{.mark} whenever there has been [a
charge]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The plea bargain]{.mark} effectively
[creates a price for being accused]{.mark} of a given crime, [whether
one is]{.mark} in fact guilty or [innocent]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[actuarily adjusted for]{.mark} [the strength of the case]{.mark} in
question and facts about the defendant\'s history]{.underline}. [Whereas
a trial must at least dwell at length on the particulars of the case
before commodifying it at sentencing]{.underline}, [a [plea
deal]{.mark}]{.underline} requires no such detour; the fact of
[[particularity]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [been]{.mark} itself
[commodified]{.mark} and priced [into]{.mark} the exchange in the form
of [probabilistic uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. To extend a
metaphor: the artisanal practice of trial litigation gives way to
quasi-automated \"assembly line\" production. This perfected first-order
[commodification]{.underline} is part of what [permits]{.underline} the
[plea bargain to become the **dominant**]{.underline} [site of
the]{.underline} second-order [commodification of justice]{.underline}
in the United States today. [[Assembly line production]{.mark} does more
than **[impose uniformity]{.mark}** on its products; it also minimizes
overall costs]{.underline}. In a system as busy as the American one, in
which all [[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} (especially public defenders)
[[are at]{.mark} constant [grips]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} what Lawrence Blumberg calls \"[[economies
of time, labor, expense]{.underline}]{.mark}\" (Blumberg 1969, 23), [the
[plea bargain]{.mark} [allows for]{.mark} the **[cheap
resolution]{.mark}** of cases, [allowing more]{.mark} \"[justice\" to be
bought for the same]{.mark} investment of
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The plea bargain is]{.underline}
therefore both a case-specific exchange between lawyers and the result
of [similar exchanges at the level of policymaking between a penal
regime and other state priorities]{.underline}. For it to fill both
roles, it must presume that [[justice can be **abstractly**]{.mark}
calibrated, **[quantified]{.mark}**, and accumulated, and [that it is
reducible]{.mark} to a metric that makes it naturally [commensurable to
other goods]{.mark}]{.underline}. It must presume, in other words, both
the first- and second-order commodification of justice. V. Consequences:
The Carceral Fetish in American Culture

#### Rejecting justice's commodity fetishism is key to end the carceral state -- the hollowness of abstraction means we're never satisfied with punishment, fueling the "punishment imperative" driving the prison-industrial complex

**Epstein 21** \[Daniel Epstein, PhD candidate in Political Science at

In this way, what Robert Knox observes about race and value, and Brenna
Bhandar about race and property, applies also to race and criminality:
the two are co-constituted through the medium of abstraction, born of
the commodity form and codified in the legal form (Knox 2016, 109-110;
Bhandar 2014, 212; Bhandar 2018, 8). Scholars of \"racial capitalism\"
have exposed many of the myriad and complex ways that race and
capitalism are entangled with one another (see, for instance, Robinson
\[1983\] 2000; Johnson 2013; Johnson 2020; Melamed 2015; Gilmore 2017;
Bhattacharya 2018). These brief reflections suggest a specific role for
the commodity form-and its corollary penal legal form in this
entanglement. Attention to this entanglement might, in turn, shed some
light on differences between the United States\' penal regime and
culture and those of other wealthy capitalist countries. While this
claim is beyond the scope of this article, it is perhaps a particular
intensity and centrality of anti-Blackness in the United States that
helps explain its greater investment in the \"immutability\" of
criminality. In the end, [[commodified justice fails to satisfy]{.mark}
even [the]{.mark} punitive [public]{.mark} [that yearns for
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. As in the Madoff case, the seeming
transcendence of [the number]{.underline} presumably [arises from its
apparent subsumption of the particular \"social character\" of the
concretely experienced harm]{.underline}, [whose negation it purports to
immanentize in abstract, quantitative form]{.underline}. But this
\"religious\" presence belongs to the aforementioned imperceptible
aspect of commodified justice-indeed, is only present insofar as it is
imperceptible, as the magic that claims to convert quality to quantity.
What is left, in the end, is [[a raw number]{.mark}, [bereft of]{.mark}
promised [meaning]{.mark}, [an icon of **false
transcendence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly, [[the commodity
fetish]{.mark} constitutes a kind of \"enchant\[ment\]\"]{.underline} of
its own (Balibar \[1994\] 2007, 60), [but, rife with the abstract
distortion of social relations]{.underline}, [this]{.underline}
enchantment [[tends to prove **hollow** and]{.mark}
**[unsatisfying]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Aladjem identifies a failure of
the formal law to provide, in the end, a suitable theodicy, showing that
\"[frustration with justice\" often leads to extra- or even anti-legal
revenge fantasies]{.underline} (Aladjem 2008, 65). At the same time, it
seems also to plausibly explain deepened investment in the penal law,
stronger commitments to long and invariable sentences. It might be,
then, that some [Americans [relate to commodified justice in terms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} what Lauren Berlant calls \"**[[cruel
optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" whereby \"something you desire is
actually an obstacle to your flourishing\" (Berlant 2011, 1). Danielle
Sered, an anti-carceral writer and restorative justice practitioner,
powerfully narrates the experience of victims of harm in terms like
this: [[If I]{.mark} do come to [believe]{.mark} the story \[that
[carceral punishment brings healing]{.mark}\], then when I am harmed, [I
want]{.mark} [the person arrested]{.mark} and sentenced because I
believe it will bring me relief]{.underline} \... I call the police [and
I participate in the process]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, if I am
like most victims, [at the end]{.underline} of doing so, [[I am]{.mark}
still **[unhealed]{.mark}**, I still [feel **unsafe**]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} my appetite for justice is still
**[unsatisfied]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But now, [unlike before I sought
that remedy, I am **heartbroken**]{.underline}. (Sered 2019, 38) Sered
goes on soon after: \[When victims like this\] testify at parole boards
that [even ten [years of]{.mark} a defendant\'s [incarceration]{.mark}
has [made no dent in their pain]{.mark}]{.underline}, many
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark} [[assume]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the
problem is]{.underline} simply that [[the person has not been
incarcerated]{.mark} long [enough]{.mark}]{.underline}, as though [one
day]{.underline} . .. we will reach the juncture where [incarceration
will finally help the victim, despite no indication that it has
contributed to their well-being]{.underline} thus far. (ibid.,
40[)]{.mark} [The particular [needs of]{.mark} Sered\'s [victim]{.mark}
[have been **neutralized** in the cold generality of the prison
sentence]{.mark}]{.underline}; to use Taussig\'s language, [[the
\"**life-force**]{.mark}\" that first seemed to pulsate [from this
response]{.mark} has **[dissipated]{.mark}**, [leaving only]{.mark} the
\"inert thing\" and **[disappointment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But this
disappointment, rather than prompting reevaluation of the practices that
led to it, seeks resolution in a magnification of them. I expect a
similar story could be told about those who have not been victimized
themselves, but who seek theodicy in punishment as Aladjem suggests
(indeed, as Sered\'s telling implies, what we think of as the
\"victim\'s perspective\" might sometimes originate from such
non-victims anyway). 9 Frustrated with justice, some [[Americans]{.mark}
**[double down]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[hoping the void]{.mark} they
feel [will be filled with more punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}, [more
justice ([more effacement of particularity, more racialized
demonization]{.mark}]{.underline}); [**[there can be no other
solution]{.mark}**, because]{.underline}, as the Marxist theorist Georg
Lukics writes, [the cognitive \"[reification]{.mark}\" typical of modern
capitalism \"[requires]{.mark} that a society should learn [to satisfy
all]{.mark} its [needs in]{.mark} terms of [commodity
exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Lukics \[1923\] 1971, 91). In doing so,
however, [these Americans affirm]{.underline} precisely
[the]{.underline} form of [justice]{.underline} [that
produced]{.underline} such **[dissatisfaction]{.underline}** in the
first place, [laying the groundwork for another cruelly optimistic
doubling-down to come]{.underline}. As Sered laments, \"[[We will punish
more]{.mark} and more harshly, [as if to prove]{.mark} that [we]{.mark}
[were not wrong]{.mark} about who \'those people\'
are]{.underline}-[[because **if we were**]{.mark}
**wrong**]{.underline}, if we are wrong, then [[we have done an
**unimaginably**]{.mark} **[terrible]{.mark}**-even an
**irreparable**?-[thing]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Sered 2019, 250).
[Commitment to [commodified justice]{.mark}]{.underline}, then,
[[performs the \"smoothing work]{.mark}\" [is-a- vis the **psychically
intolerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} that Lisa Wedeen, drawing on Zizek
and Frederic Jameson, identifies as a central function of ideology
(Wedeen 2019, 5-7). Here, though, [this \"[smoothing]{.mark}
[work]{.mark}\" [operates though **perpetual intensification**]{.mark},
as [it is]{.mark} precisely [the]{.mark} always-insistent [possibility
of its own]{.mark} ultimate [emptiness]{.mark} and depravity
[that]{.mark} [commodified justice]{.mark}, qua ideology, [must]{.mark}
continually work to [stave off]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is not
surprising that such [a [society]{.mark}, caught [in]{.mark} the grips
of [this **vicious**]{.mark} **[cycle]{.mark}**, [should become]{.mark}
**[obsessed with punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Criminologist Gordon
Bazemore, observing the prison boom of the late twentieth century,
speaks of a \"policymaker addiction to punishment\" (2007, 653), and
other commentators note a tendency to see \"concrete and steel cages as
catch-all solutions to social problems\" (Gilmore and Kilgore, 2019, n.
p.). Evidence of this obsession is readily present not only in the law
books, but in the media and entertainment industries (Novek 2011).
[Police procedurals, courtroom dramas, stories set in prison, true crime
narratives-]{.underline}all these and more [are ubiquitous]{.underline}
in American entertainment, **[dramatizing]{.underline}** [the
commodified processes]{.underline} described above. [This
**omnipresence** of punishment]{.underline} in the American political
psyche and in its cultural forms [can]{.underline} perhaps [be
understood]{.underline} by what Guy Debord, leader of the Situationist
International and maybe the foremost post-war theorist of the commodity
fetish, conceptualizes [as]{.underline} \"[the]{.underline}
**[spectacle]{.underline}**,\" [the perceptible world under conditions
of the **total commodification** of social relations]{.underline}, [from
which persons are alienated]{.underline}. For Debord, \"[the spectacle
corresponds to the historical moment at which the commodity completes
its colonization of social life \... commodities are now allthere is to
see; the world we see is the world of the commodity]{.underline}\"
(Debord \[1967\] 1995, 29). The inhabitants of this
world-[the]{.underline} Beckerian penal [policymaker]{.underline}, the
[victim]{.underline} of harm, the theodicy-hungry [citizen]{.underline},
and [the]{.underline} everyday [consumer of culture-are
confronted]{.underline}, in different ways, [with]{.underline} a
**[spectacularized]{.underline}** brand of [justice]{.underline},
[where]{.underline}, truly, \"[[commodities are all there is]{.mark} [to
see]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" And awe-inspiring as [these
spectacles]{.underline} may sometimes seem, they offer, Debord writes,
[only \"a specious form of the sacred]{.underline}\" (ibid., 20). In the
final analysis, there is nothing behind the mist. VI. Conclusion: Where
We Go from Here What, then, is to be done? While commodified justice is
an ideological phenomenon, merely adjusting our beliefs and expectations
about punishment in awareness of its existence will not be sufficient to
solve it. Understanding ideology as form means that [one must speak of
commodified justice as I have as a material distortion and not merely a
subjective delusion]{.underline}; \"it constitutes . . . the way in
which reality . . . cannot but appear\" under conditions of capitalism
(Balibar \[1994\] 2007, 60). As I have sought to show in this article,
commodified justice in the United States is not a mere metaphor; the
conceptual grammar of justice really is the conceptual grammar of
commodification and commodity exchange. This does not mean that this
grammar is intractable, but rather that it must be eliminated at its
root by ending the practices that give rise to it (Pashukanis \[1924\]
2003, 188). [[To overcome]{.mark} the [commodification]{.mark} of
justice, in other words, [justice]{.mark} itself [must be done
differently]{.mark}]{.underline}. The rudiments of an alternative
perhaps already exist. In recent decades, activists, grassroots
organizers, and reformers have begun to enact and theorize paradigms of
\"restorative\" and/or \"transformative\" justice, which respond to harm
and conflict in ways that involve guided encounter and dialogue between
harmed parties, responsible parties, and other relevant stakeholders,
for the purposes not of abstract retribution or deterrence but of
interpersonal repair and, ideally, social/communal transformation.10
Restorative and transformative justice thereby resist the
commodification outlined above by refusing to abstract from the
particular and qualitative aspects of harm and justice,\" both
interpersonally and societally. In this way, [restorative]{.underline}
and transformative [justice]{.underline} plausibly [militate against
many of the ills of commodified justice]{.underline} described above.
First, while [[commodified justice **alienates**]{.mark} both [wronged
parties and]{.mark} [wrongdoers from themselves by **assimilating**
their unique personhoods,]{.mark} experiences, reasons, needs, and
obligations [to **abstract**, **totalizing**
categories]{.mark}]{.underline}, restorative and transformative justice
center particular stakeholders, allowing them to decide on an
appropriate response, one that optimizes for \"use-value\" as they
recognize it. Second, while [commodified justice furthers]{.underline}
various forms of [oppression both by **concealing** racism in
utilitarian algorithms and by facilitating acute **racial demonization**
by means of the penal system]{.underline}, restorative and
transformative justice undercut this logic. Indeed, [if racial
capitalism]{.underline}-as Jodi Melamed, drawing on Ruth Wilson Gilmore,
[suggests]{.underline}-is \"[a technology of
**antirelationality\'**]{.underline}(Melamed 2015, 78-79, 82), then
restorative justice and transformative justice, by emphasizing \"the
fact of relationship, of our connectedness\" as central to justice
(Llewellyn and Philpott 2014, 18; see also Kaba 2019), resist it.
Moreover, by involving the responsible party, considering his or her
needs, and honoring his or her capability to make appropriate repairs,
restorative and transformative justice militate against demonization as
such, and so too its racialized character. Finally, while [[commodified
justice]{.mark} **[alienates]{.mark}** all persons from [justice]{.mark}
in [general by making it **fetishistic**, **sterile**, and]{.mark}
\"**[spectacular]{.mark}**]{.underline}\"-[often related to in cruelly
optimistic]{.underline} [terms]{.underline}-restorative justice and
transformative justice potentially provide a form of public justice that
may be felt, meaningful, and fulfilling, because they are responsive to
real social relations, not fetishistic abstractions. Debord writes that
\"[the spectacle is the **opposite of dialogue**]{.underline}\" (Debord
\[1967\] 1995, 17); restorative and transformative justice, which make
dialogue a foundational principle, therefore may provide one manner of
unmaking it. Certainly, such frameworks are themselves threatened by
logics of commodification in certain configurations and applications
(Koen 2013; Harney and Moten 2013, 63; Joseph 2014, 57-58)- particularly
restorative justice, which has been more open to dilution and cooptation
than its counterpart (Kaba 2021a, 148-149). Nonetheless, criminologist
Raymond Koen, in his Pashukanian analysis of restorative justice,
maintains that even this paradigm retains a revolutionary core. Though
\"partial forms\" may be neutralized and coopted by capitalism,
capitalism \"cannot countenance\" \"comprehensive restorative justice,\"
which \"accords with the legal morality of socialism\" (Koen 2013, 228).
He continues: \"It seems, then, that the realisation of the
revolutionary potentialities of restorative justice in its comprehensive
aspect will require a socialist revolution against the hegemony of
capitalism and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In other words, if
our future justice is to be restorative, our future society would
probably have to be socialist\" (ibid., 228-229). Committed proponents
of restorative and transformative justice, then, should also be
anti-capitalist; to do justice differently, at least at scale, a new
kind of society may be required. This is not to say, however, that
advocating and organizing for restorative and transformative justice
should be seen as politically secondary to broader anti-capitalist
efforts. To the contrary, disrupting the commodification of justice, and
its attendant reinscription of capitalist ideology, would seem a
potentially important prerequisite to the eventual achievement of a
post-capitalist world. Therefore, anti-capitalists should support
present projects of restorative and transformative justice. The two
imperatives-de-commodifying justice and dismantling capitalism-are
mutually reinforcing

#### The hollowness of commodified justice demands the construction of social demons to punish, reproducing black social death

Form," Journal of Law and Political Economy,

V. Consequences: The Carceral Fetish in American Culture So far, I have
sought to demonstrate the deep relationship between modes of punishment
in the United States and the commodity form. In this section, I consider
the consequences of this diagnosis for the social meaning of crime and
punishment in the United States. I therefore shift the main site of
analysis from penal theory and policy to culture and popular ideology.
The analysis here is somewhat speculative and certainly not exhaustive.
Nevertheless, it seeks to illuminate some consequences of commodified
justice in the United States. Marx considers the lived relationship
between human beings and commodities in his famous discussion of
\"commodity fetishism.\" Primarily, this phrase refers to a particular
kind of distorted perception necessitated by capitalist relations. In [a
commodity, \"the social character of men\'s labour appears to them as an
objective character stamped upon the product of that
labour]{.underline}\" (Marx \[1867\] 1978, 320); [quality **disappears**
into]{.underline} [quantity]{.underline}, and is only perceptible
through this mediation. In this sense, [the [qualities of a
commodity]{.mark} \"[are]{.mark} at the same time [perceptible and
**imperceptible** by the senses]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (ibid., 320-321).
As an existing thing with some use, [a commodity is]{.underline}
necessarily [given]{.underline} to perception, but insofar as it is
defined by its [**[abstract exchange-value]{.mark}**, this perception
[**cannot** contain]{.mark} the whole of [its
meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}. Partaking of the \"transcendent,\"
simultaneously in and out of existence, a commodity is experienced as
\"a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and
theological niceties\" (319-320). As the anthropologist Michael T.
Taussig (2010) puts it, capitalist subjects have a \"schizoid attitude\"
toward commodities, \"an attitude that shows itself to be deeply
mystical. On the one hand, these abstractions are cherished as real
objects akin to inert things, whereas on the other, they are thought of
as animate entities with a life-force of their own akin to spirits or
gods\" (ibid., 4-5). The relation to commodities that takes place in
these \"mist-enveloped regions of the religious world\" is the commodity
fetish (Marx \[1867\] 1978, 321). The way the fetish organizes the
meaningful world forms an important piece of the \"horizon of the
taken-for-granted,\" to repeat Stuart Hall\'s artful phrase from the
introduction; it is one part of the material structure of ideology under
capitalism, the lived conditions that shape cognitive a prioris about
\"what the world is and how it works, for all practical purposes\" (Hall
1988, 44). We can readily [apply]{.underline} the idea of [the
**commodity fetish** to]{.underline} the relationship between persons
and [commodified justice]{.underline} in the United States. [[Legal
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}, as we have seen, also [[**convert** the
concrete]{.mark} and particular [into the]{.mark} general and
[abstract]{.mark}]{.underline}, such that-in first-order
commodification-[the sentence becomes the \"objective
character]{.underline}\" stamped onto the particular event in question.
Indeed, ready-to- hand bits of [folk wisdom]{.underline}-that \"crime
doesn\'t pay,\" and that to spend time in prison is [to \"**pay one\'s
debts** to society]{.underline},\" for
instance-[demonstrate]{.underline} how central this fact is to [the
subjective meaning of [justice]{.mark}]{.underline} to many Americans.
One need only observe the public reaction when a high-profile sentence
is handed down to [[perceive]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[power]{.mark} and pathos contained [in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the
number]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which]{.underline} [seems to
**[overflow]{.mark}** [its]{.mark} semantic [quantitative]{.mark}
[significance]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, consider the 2009
sentencing of Bernie [Madoff]{.underline}, who ran the largest Ponzi
scheme in American history, to [**150 years** in prison]{.underline}. In
his comments at sentencing, Judge Denny Chin admitted that, given
Madoff\'s advanced age, \"[any sentence above 20 or 25 years would be
largely, if not **entirely**, **symbolic**]{.underline}.\" Transcript of
Sentencing Hearing at 46-47, United States v. Madoff, No. 09-213
(S.D.N.Y. March 12, 2009). Nonetheless, [Chin insisted]{.underline} that
\"th[e symbolism is important\" for its retributive message, deterrent
force, and value to the victims]{.underline} (ibid., 47-49). As a New
York Times reporter editorialized, \"\[[Chin\] seemed to find away to
**translate**]{.underline} society\'s **[rage into a
number]{.underline}**\" (Weiser 2011). [[Madoffs sentence]{.mark}, then,
[seems]{.mark} a classic case of **[fetishistic
distortion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Use-value-Madoffs real wrongs and the
real impact of his punishment-is articulated as exchange-value-150 years
in prison-which then stands in fetishistically for the use-value it
displaces; Madoff \"deserves\" 150 years (Sentencing Transcript, 47), a
sentence that the same judge affirms, only lines above, can have no real
meaning in human terms. And yet it appears to be [from
[this]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[symbolic conversion]{.mark}-and the
excess it enables while purporting to contain-that the sentence [derives
its gravity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The spirit of [justice
inheres]{.mark}]{.underline}, it seems, [[in]{.mark} the frisson
of]{.underline} [[quantitative abstraction itself]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The \"metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties\" of prison
sentences are rarely so apparent, but this is not to say they are not
routinely present. Indeed, Terry K. Aladjem theorizes that [punitive
cultural attitudes in [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
amount to the \"rudiments of an American **[theodicy]{.mark}**,\" a
quasi- religious [attempt to find]{.mark} meaning in and [justification
for]{.mark} the [evil]{.mark} apparent in the world]{.underline}
(Aladjem 2008, especially 68-72, 92; the quoted phrase comes from the
chapter title). This search, of course, can do great harm to those it
typifies as \"evil.\" It involves operations upon [the abstract figure
of the \"criminal]{.underline},\" which, [facilitated by [the
commodification of crime]{.mark} and punishment]{.underline} with which
it is associated, [[has]{.mark} itself [become a]{.mark} kind of
exchangeable [commodity]{.mark}, [a \"blank, transparent, blamable
individual]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (ibid., 59). Indeed, if Isaac Balbus
is right that [a]{.underline} certain \"[[**fetishism** of the
Law]{.mark}\" [leads persons]{.mark} [to \"affirm]{.mark} that [they owe
their existence to]{.mark} [the Law]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Balbus 1977,
583), then it is easy to surmise how [persons who violate this law may
be regarded: as]{.underline}, in a way, [without existence, or at least
underserving thereof]{.underline}. [[The criminal
becomes]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a way,
**[[inhuman]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [defined by the \"objective
character\" that has been \"stamped upon]{.underline}\"
[him]{.underline} or her. Joshua Kleinfeld argues that the culture of
[punishment in the United States]{.underline} differs from those of
Europe in its tendency to [understand]{.underline} [criminality as
\"**immutable** and **devaluing**\"-a mark of **definitive \"evil**\" or
**dangerousness**]{.underline} (Kleinfeld 2016, 943). [The distribution
of these marks of \"evil\" is, of course, highly
racialized]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} this [[racism makes a]{.mark}
crucial [contribution to]{.mark} the **[punitive cultural
theodicy]{.mark}**]{.underline} that Aladjem diagnoses. Indeed, Adam
Kotsko suggests in his \"political theology of late capital\" that
[[the]{.mark} **neoliberal** [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [requires
the construction of]{.mark} certain [social demons]{.mark}, a role it
has assigned to]{.underline} (among others) [Black people]{.underline}
as a racial group, [presumptively]{.underline} [[associated with crime
and]{.underline} [requiring punishment]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kotsko
2018, 91-93; quoted material comes from the book\'s subtitle).
[Associations between Blackness and criminality]{.underline} of this
kind [can be facilitated]{.underline}, as we\'ve seen, [by]{.underline}
the actuarial techniques associated with [the]{.underline} second-order
[commodification of justice]{.underline}. We are now in a better
position than before, however, to recognize the fetishistic aspect of
this linkage, the way it exceeds contingent epistemic error and operates
as a general ideological touchstone. For Angela Davis, [[probabilistic
considerations]{.mark} surrounding release from prison [render]{.mark}
\"real human [beings]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . [[in a]{.mark} seemingly
[race-neutral way]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . [[fetishistically
exchangeable]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [crimes]{.mark} they have already
committed or will commit in the future]{.underline}\" (quoted in Joseph
2014, 31)-a race-neutrality that Davis is well aware is illusory. The
sociologist Avery Gordon affirms this link: \"[[African
Americans]{.mark} are treated as a criminal race, whose
[ontology]{.mark} what they [were]{.mark}, what they are, what they
could be-is reduced to its **[essential criminality]{.mark}**, their
supposed basic nature]{.underline}\" (Gordon 2017, 202). For such an
equation to be made, \"[Blackness,\" like the commodified figure of
\"the criminal,\" must be rendered **inert** and **abstract**, divested
of particularity and available for an \"objective character\" to be
\"stamped\" on it]{.underline}. The critical race and legal scholar
Anthony Paul Farley goes even further, [posit]{.underline}ing
[Blackness]{.underline}-in resonant terms for our current purposes-as
[\"the]{.underline} [apogee of the commodity]{.underline} . . . the
point . . . at which [[the **commodity**]{.mark} **[becomes
flesh]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (Farley 2004, 1229). In this way, what
Robert Knox observes about [race and value]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} Brenna Bhandar about [race and property]{.underline},
[applies]{.underline} also [to race and criminality]{.underline}: the
two are co-constituted through the medium of [abstraction]{.underline},
[born of the commodity form and codified in the legal form]{.underline}
(Knox 2016, 109-110; Bhandar 2014, 212; Bhandar 2018, 8). Scholars of
\"[[racial capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}\" have exposed many of the
myriad and complex ways that race and capitalism are entangled with one
another (see, for instance, Robinson \[1983\] 2000; Johnson 2013;
Johnson 2020; Melamed 2015; Gilmore 2017; Bhattacharya 2018). These
brief reflections [[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} a specific role for
[[the]{.mark} [commodity form]{.mark}-and its]{.underline} corollary
[penal legal form]{.underline} in this entanglement. Attention to this
entanglement might, in turn, shed some light on differences between the
United States\' penal regime and culture and those of other wealthy
capitalist countries. While this claim is beyond the scope of this
article, [it is perhaps a particular intensity and centrality of
anti-Blackness in the United States that helps explain its greater
investment in the \"immutability\" of criminality]{.underline}. In the
end, commodified justice fails to satisfy even the punitive public that
yearns for it. As in the Madoff case, the seeming transcendence of the
number presumably arises from its apparent subsumption of the particular
\"social character\" of the concretely experienced harm, whose negation
it purports to immanentize in abstract, quantitative form. But this
\"religious\" presence belongs to the aforementioned imperceptible
aspect of commodified justice-indeed, is only present insofar as it is
imperceptible, as the magic that claims to convert quality to quantity.
What is left, in the end, is a raw number, bereft of promised meaning,
an icon of false transcendence

other present political formation, PIC [**[abolitionism]{.underline}**
[recognizes]{.underline}]{.mark} that reimagining justice in
restorative/ transformative terms (see, for instance, Davis 2003,
113-115; Kaba 2021b, 3-4) and \"[the founding of [a new society\"
**beyond capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Harney and Moten 2013, 42)
imply one another. Indeed, Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2020) emphasizes that
[[abolition must be]{.mark} \"**red**]{.underline},\" [aligned with
[anti-capitalist]{.mark} objectives]{.underline}, and abolitionist
organizers Mariame Kaba and Kelly Hayes perhaps intuit much of the
analysis in this article when they bemoan [[the PIC\'s **grounding** in
\"the]{.mark} **[commodification of human
beings]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (Kaba and Hayes 2021, 24). A way beyond
commodified justice therefore emerges. [Through bold, abolitionist
politics, we can hope to change justice by \"chang\[ing\]
everything]{.underline}\" (Kaba 2021b, 5; Gilmore forthcoming).

#### Abolition must be an anticapitalist project -- the penal state is defined by its reification of class and its control of superfluous labor

Political economies of punishment Thus, as the preceding discussion
makes clear, while it is commonly asserted that Marx had little to say
about crime and punishment, he was central to contributing a framework
through which to question and interrogate notions of crime and
punishment under capitalist conditions, as defined through the state and
dominant cultural apparatus. Indeed, as de Giorgi (2007: 18) has noted,
the Marxist 'materialist approach, which sees processes of social change
as shaped by the structural relationship between modes of production and
legal/political institutions', has 'represented a powerful framework for
critical sociologies of punishment'. And these 'critical sociologies'
have proved germane to abolitionist praxis. For they provide one way of
interpreting how prisons, and dominant modes of punishment more broadly,
operate beyond notions of crime as they are officially defined in the
first place. Central to this mode of analysis has been studies of the
political economy (or economies) of punishment, not least Punishment and
Social Structure, published in 1939 and written by Georg Rusche and Otto
Kirchheimer, exiles from Nazi Germany. Punishment and Social Structure
built on and developed Rusche's earlier 1933 essay, 'Labor Market and
Penal Sanction', in which he had argued that: 'Often, legal historians
are guided not by an unprejudiced analysis of social laws, but by an
evolutionary conception of the development of legal institutions: from
barbaric cruelty to the humanitarianism of the relatively perfect legal
system which we supposedly enjoy today' (Rusche, 1978 \[1933\]: 5).
Rusche suggested that such accounts were naïve, failing to comprehend
the 'social functions of crime and criminal justice' and the way these
'are shaped by various forces'. Prime among these [social forces was the
broader fluctuations of labour markets (and indeed dominant modes of
production) and the overall position of the lowest strata of the
proletariat]{.underline}. 'Naturally, the scarcity or surplus of workers
does not unequivocally determine the nature of the labor market', he
argued (Rusche, 1978 \[1933\]: 4), and in the same manner he never
suggested that this would unequivocally determine criminal justice
either. But his analysis was that [as this scarcity or surplus changed,
so too would the criminal justice apparatus 'have to meet
different]{.underline} [tasks']{.underline}. Taken up in Punishment and
Social Structure, the basic proposition was that '\[[e\]very system of
production tends to discover punishments which correspond to its
productive relationships']{.underline} (Rusche and Kirchheimer, 2008
\[1939\]: 5), and what became known as [the
**[Rusche-Kirchheimer]{.mark}** thesis argued that [at times of
increased surplus labour,]{.mark} punishment becomes explicitly and
expressively violent (with corporal and [capital punishments]{.mark}
[abound]{.mark}ing), [whereas]{.mark} [at points of labour
scarcity]{.mark}, [punishments utilizing]{.mark} the [labour]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} those [convict]{.mark}ed of crimes
[predominate]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a historical overview stretching
from the Middle Ages to the point of the book's publication in the 20th
century, this schema is utilized to explore punishments including (among
other things) banishment, houses of correction and prisons (see Garland,
1990: 93). Embedded within the analysis is an interpretation and
attempted demonstration of the function(s) of criminal justice and
punishment as instruments of class control, and, as Aviram (2015) states
with reference to this analysis: Given that [criminal
[enforcement]{.mark} was]{.underline}, and still is,
[geared]{.underline} almost [**invariably** to the poor]{.underline},
[it served as a tool for [managing surplus labor or providing access to
forced]{.mark} [working hands]{.mark}.]{.underline} The uniqueness of
criminal law in serving this function lies in its dual role: not only
does [enforcement and [punishment]{.mark} constitute an effective
instrument of oppression, but they also [come with]{.mark} seemingly
[**class-neutral**, moral, ideological
justifications]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus [[giving legitimacy to
the]{.mark} prevailing [mode of production and quelling protest]{.mark}
and uprising]{.underline}. (Aviram, 2015: 16) Now, the criticisms of
Punishment and Social Structure have been wide-ranging. As Garland has
noted, for example, it is 'sometimes lightly dismissed by critics as
nothing more than crude reductionism' (Garland, 1990: 89), while
criticisms have also emphasized the ways in which it is not attuned to
(for example) the gender dynamics of punishment (see Howe, 1994). But at
the same time, it has been integral to a trajectory of Marxist and
neo-Marxist thought and organizing which has understood its flaws, built
from them and sought to address them. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, for
instance, its central messages were taken up within segments of academia
-- in some cases connected to social movements -- challenging the
dominant organizing principles of their respective disciplines (in
sociology, criminology, social history and so on) in ways reminiscent of
Rusche's criticisms of legal historians in the 1930s. For example,
Steven Box noted in 1981 that conflict and labelling theories as applied
to criminal justice 'need to be supplemented by a wider, more historical
and macro view' (Box, 1981: 200) in order to interpret the function of
[[legal]{.underline}]{.mark} [[systems]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}ing ['the [weaken]{.mark}ing of
[ideological and social]{.mark} [hegemony]{.mark}' and facilitating the
[control]{.mark} [of]{.mark} those interpreted as '[**problem**
**populations'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Box, 1981: 200). And drawing on
Spitzer's analysis of such [populations as those [who]{.mark}se
'behaviour, personal qualities and/or position [threaten]{.mark} the
social relations of production in [capitalist
societies']{.mark}]{.underline} (Spitzer, 1975: 642), he highlighted how
[[the economically marginalized are 'treated more harshly]{.mark} by the
judicial system not simply [because of]{.mark} who they are, but also
because of [what they symbolize]{.mark}, namely [the perceived threat to
social]{.mark} [order]{.mark} posed [by the]{.mark} threat of the
[permanently unemployed']{.mark}]{.underline} (Box, 1981: 200). In other
words, his research was one example of analyses exploring the
relationship between labour market conditions, criminalization and
punishment (see the discussion in Chiricos and Delone, 1992). At the
same time, a trajectory of work examining the relationships between
punishment, labour markets and capitalist conditions has (among other
things) demonstrated the dual-regulatory functions of punishment and
incarceration. In doing so, this has expanded beyond examining
correlations between employment (or unemployment) and punishment,
exploring the ancillary functions of punishment more broadly. As Melossi
and Pavarini (1981: 17) demonstrated, for instance, in The Prison and
the Factory, [[workhouses]{.underline}]{.mark} in the 17th century [were
utilized to both [bend incarcerated peoples to]{.mark} the most
precarious strata of the emergent [capitalist conditions]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} also [discipline the nascent working]{.mark}
[class]{.mark}]{.underline} more broadly, [who]{.underline}, it was
feared, [could threaten social order if they engaged in
revolt]{.underline}. Coalescing in parts with and developing the
analysis of Punishment and Social Structure, the principle of less
eligibility central to the poor laws was integral to the analysis here,
with the shadows of the workhouse and later the prison stretching well
beyond their walls (see also Peck, 2001: 41--42). But as would also be
foregrounded, it is **[subordination]{.underline}** that was [the
hallmark of the 'modern' prison as it emerged]{.underline}, a key factor
of the 'penitentiary relationship' both then and now (Melossi and
Pavarini, 1981: 187). For, as Melossi (2008: 242) would later argue,
[[the 'permanent lesson']{.mark} of the penitentiary [is to]{.mark}
'[submit' to]{.mark} the 'bearers of [power']{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, this needs to be borne in mind while the broader rationalities
of punishment fluctuate, not least with regard to structural changes
within capitalist economies themselves. As de Giorgi (2018) has
demonstrated, for example, analyses of political economies of punishment
need radical reexamination at points where the dominant modalities of
political economy are themselves undergoing shifts. Foregrounding
neoliberalism's making explicit of capitalism's class war from above, he
highlights how the 'punitive turn' within many countries in the Global
North (not least, but not only, the UK and America) from the 1970s
onwards was (and is) related to structural shifts in political economy.
Certainly, this does not mean that penal policies prior to this point
were not punitive: a hagiography sometimes sustained by narratives of a
20th-century 'rehabilitative ideal' (for discussion, see Bailey, 2019
and Sim, 2009). However, as de Giorgi and indeed many others have
explored, [the neoliberal juncture has coalesced with a frontal assault
on working conditions, protections and organizing]{.underline} (Bogg,
2016); [solidified, reworked and reproduced gendered, racialized and
disablist social relatio]{.underline}ns (Ryan, 2019; d'Atri, 2021); and
[foregrounded and reworked carceral logics and the development of
carceral states]{.underline} (Lamble, 2013). Against this backdrop,
[prisons operate as]{.underline} one aspect of [a]{.underline} much
broader [assemblage of institutions]{.underline} and dynamics: [ranging
from the satellite forms of detention, dispersal and deportation of
irrregularized migrants]{.underline} (Bowling and Westenra, 2020), [to
the targeted policing and 'management' of racially minoritized
groups]{.underline} (Williams and Clarke, 2016), [to the punitive
utilization of welfare as a form of control]{.underline} (Mills, 2019)
[for contemporary surplussed populations]{.underline} (see Burnett,
2015; Haiven, 2020). This is of course not exhaustive, but for de Giorgi
(2018: 11--12), one of the most pressing tasks facing analyses of
political economies of punishment has been to take stock of such
developments, while simultaneously formulating a 'non-reductionist ...
structural critique of penal power that is capable of overcoming the
false alternative between structure and culture at the same time as it
addresses some important theoretical concerns emerging from different
theoretical paradigms within the sociology of punishment' (de Giorgi,
2018: 11--12). At a point where [the 'dramatic increase under
neoliberalism in the capacity of states to carry out policing, carceral,
border, and military violence, domestically and globally, is linked to
the need to manage surplus populations -- and ... is racially
coded']{.underline} (Kundnani, 2021: 65), this is an urgent task.
Marxism and abolitionist praxis So, drawing from the preceding
discussion, how have Marxist ideas informed broader traditions and
contemporary forms of penal abolitionism? How are Marxist frameworks
situated within penal abolitionism? In the first instance, as Thomas
Mathiesen demonstrated more than half a century ago, [[Marxist
frameworks are **vital** in understanding]{.mark} the ways in which
prisons and [punishment]{.mark} [**obscure** the harms of capitalist
power]{.mark} and the realities of capitalist order]{.underline}(s). In
The Politics of Abolition (Mathiesen, 2015 \[1974\]), he explains how
[[prisons]{.underline} [perform]{.underline}]{.mark}
[multiple]{.underline} interrelated [ideological functions]{.underline}
in capitalist societies: [[an **expurgatory**]{.mark} function
('**housing'**, managing and in some contexts ridding societies of those
deemed 'unproductive' or surplussed); a **[powerdraining]{.mark}**
function (geared towards rendering those incarcerated **subservient** to
the bearers of power); a **[diverting]{.mark}** function (from the harms
of the powerful); [and a **symbolic** function]{.mark} (by
**stigmatizing** those punished, reaffirming the legitimacy of
capitalist orders themselves]{.underline}). To that, he later added an
action function which, through building, expanding and reproducing
expansive [penal power, confirms to societies that something is 'being
done' about crime; while other institutions perform some of these
functions]{.underline}, the prison, he argued, coheres them together in
a way that is unique. Indeed, despite the persistent failure to perform
its stated roles ('rehabilitation', prevention of offending and so on),
it is this cohering of functions in real terms which ensures the prison
survives as an institution while other institutions performing some of
these functions are dismantled (see Mathiesen, 2006: 141--142). As such,
Mathieson's analysis makes clear that when taken together, [these
functions have the effect of making prisons and dominant forms of
punishment appear meaningful and legitimate]{.underline}. Such is the
paradigmatic power of the prison, he argues, that [it is simultaneously
seen as a central reason why and when crime rates fall, while
simultaneously articulated as more necessary when crime rates
rise]{.underline}. In other words, 'disparate events and actions become
meaningful in light of it' (Mathiesen, 2006: 56) and the prison thus
maintains its hegemonic position, despite its failures on its own terms.
Of course, this process is aided by a whole range of political figures
and professionals, and segments of the media and the intelligentsia,
working routinely to normalize the prison. But, as he continues, what is
distinct in capitalist orders is the materialist underpinnings of these
ideological functions. For example, as Joe Sim has demonstrated, Marxist
frameworks are integral for deconstructing the notions of crime and
criminalization themselves. For [[prisons are]{.mark} mechanisms for
'punishing the poor']{.underline}, he argues, which '[along with the
wider criminal justice system \[are\] corrosive [sites for the
"churning" of vast, increasingly racialised, numbers of the
dispossessed, pauperised and destitute']{.mark}]{.underline} (Sim, 2020:
25--26). [Criminalization]{.underline} was, and [remains central to this
process, he continues: often violent, and involving 'state and
media-driven focus on policing the behaviour, morals, families and
communities of the poor and the powerless']{.underline} (Sim, 2009: 9).
Yet contrast this, he further maintains, with the 'non-criminalisation
and non-policing of the powerful, and their systematic criminality'
(Sim, 2017). Tombs (2015), for instance, has documented in detail the
concerted deregulation (or re-regulation) of corporate harms and
violence which have come to exist as hallmarks of Britain's neoliberal
project(s): involving a defunding and, in real terms, close to neutering
of regulatory agencies such as the Health and Safety Executive and
Environment Agency, to the point where they are in many cases no longer
able to carry out their statutory duties. Grenfell Tower in London is
emblematic of the costs of this assault, with the deaths of more than 70
people and immeasurable damage to hundreds of others as the building
burned in 2017 -- some of Britain's poorest residents living in one of
its wealthiest areas -- indistinguishable not just from the local
authority cost-cutting leading to palpably unsafe cladding, but also the
dismantling of regulatory structures which ultimately facilitated the
continued circulation of electrical goods, known to be dangerous, from
which the fire most likely originated (Tombs, 2020). Due to the sheer
scale of death, Grenfell Tower could not be ignored, although it should
be noted that survivors and their families continue to be treated with
contempt (see Kale, 2022). But much of the damage, death and violence
routinely caused by forms of 'state-corporate violence' (Tombs, 2016: 3)
in Britain -- the 50,000 deaths a year related to work, the 29,000
deaths a year related to air pollution or the 500 deaths a year due to
foodborne illnesses -- are 'virtually ignored, not only within the
worldview of liberal reform groups but also within mainstream
criminology and, not surprisingly, within the state itself' (Sim, 2009:
9). [Some **[15 per cent]{.mark}** of those in prison [are
homeless]{.mark} [prior]{.mark} to their incarceration. Almost **[two
thirds]{.mark}** of those in prison [have been]{.mark}
[unemployed]{.mark} immediately [prior]{.mark} to their
incarceration]{.underline}. Almost [[half]{.mark} of those in prison
[were expelled from]{.mark} [school]{.mark} as children. Around **[90
per cent]{.mark}** [have a 'mental disorder']{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[over half of all women prisoners have previously experienced emotional,
physical or sexual abuse]{.underline} (see Birmingham, 2003; Scott and
Codd, 2010; Williams, Poyser and Hopkins, 2012; Prison Reform Trust,
2016, 2021; Wyld, Lomax and Collinge, 2018). And that this is [the case
is related to the way in which the state's focus is frequently trained
on the 'poor and [the powerless]{.mark} whose
[depredations]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is argued, [[need to be
controlled]{.mark} through criminal justice interventions, one of which
is the prison']{.underline} (Sim, 2009: 9). As Reiman (2004 \[1979\])
explained over 40 years ago, '[the rich get richer and the poor get
prison']{.underline}, and this is because the functions of the prison
cannot be explained simply through crime as a social category. Rather,
[the prison is connected intimately 'with the reproduction of an unequal
and unjust social order divided by the social lacerations of class,
gender, "race", age and sexuality']{.underline} (Sim, 2009: 8). As such,
Marxist and neo-Marxist frameworks have been instrumental in
demonstrating how the prison reproduces such forms of social order, not
least through forms of conjunctural analysis associated most clearly
with the work of Stuart Hall. Hall and Massey described the conjuncture
as the 'period during which the different social, political, economic
and ideological contradictions that are at work in society come together
to give it a specific and distinctive shape' (Hall and Massey, 2010:
57). By developing conjunctural analyses which cut 'across political,
economic, social and ideological level' (Danewid, 2022: 26), this in
turn situates the particularities of the present 'within the antagonisms
and ruptures of the historical longue durée' (Danewid, 2022: 26). In
this regard, Marxist penal abolitionists -- or those speaking to Marxist
analyses of criminalization and punishment -- have situated the prison
materially, symbolically and instrumentally. For example, analyses have
emphasized how the utilization of incarcerated people's labour power --
fundamental to the origins of the prison -- has largely been abandoned
in the neoliberal conjuncture, where a core function of the prison has
been to warehouse people, not least the swelling ranks of contemporary
surplussed populations (see, for example, Wacquant, 2012). However, more
recent analyses indicate that this could be elaborated further still,
for a resurgent commitment to utilizing work in prisons (and also in
immigration detention) does not contradict this notion of warehousing so
much as develop understandings of it. Work roles in large part operate
as mechanisms for constructing order within carceral institutions. While
in some cases (in prisons) opened up to broader labour markets, work
roles are utilized more frequently (and in conjunction) as mechanisms of
social control within carceral sites. Here, work demands to be
understood in terms of broader labour market functions, but also beyond
them: by way of labour processes and what might be described as forms of
pacification (see Burnett, 2022). Yet, in doing so, this further demands
analysis of the ideological functions and rationalizations of carceral
spaces; for work, in certain sites in particular, is held up as central
to market-led notions of 'rehabilitation' and, in the process,
rationalizes the continued growth of the prison itself. For instance,
the symbiotic relationship between liberal notions of reform and
authoritarian ideals of punishment and control intersect spatially and
materially at points where prison expansion is underpinned by claims of
getting 'prisoners skilled up, and getting them into work' (Raab, 2022)
and providing 'thousands of jobs for local communities, boosting
economies' (Ministry of Justice, 2022). Judah Schept (2015) has
documented extensively how liberalism is central to carceral reshaping
and expansion, making absolutely clear how notions of reform and of
'progressive' punishment can exist symbiotically with punishing,
punitive policies and practices to buttress carceral states. His work --
on things like the euphemistically named 'Justice Campuses' in the
United States -- clearly shows how liberal ideals or perspectives
operate seductively through reformist rationalizations for expansions of
state power, while in turn, he foregrounds the importance of analyses of
place and of space, which cannot be differentiated from such broader
ideological positioning. Indeed, as his and other Marxist geographical
analysis has demonstrated, at local levels carceral power is shaped
materially, embedded within urban restructuring, labour deregulation,
gender governance, and broader economic and social relations (Story,
2019: 5). And it is within such contexts that Marxist abolitionist
analyses can have significant purchase. For the labour market functions
of carceral logics do need foregrounding, but in terms of the real as
opposed to the imagined social order (see Pearce, 1976). As has been
demonstrated elsewhere, prisons 'drain resources from other areas of
social life, such as hospitals, schools, housing or social services'
(Drake and Scott, 2017). As 'fixes' for crises of land, capital and
state capacity (see Wilson-Gilmore, 2007), they operate as 'warehouses
of suffering and death', according to Scott (2017), and as they absorb
people, he continues, it is imperative to foreground that they are, at
heart, 'designed to inflict pain and suffering' (Scott, 2018: 207).
Conclusion Ultimately, then, Marxist frameworks have provided and
continue to provide 'ways of seeing' (to use Berger's \[2008 (1972)\]
terminology) which are integral for abolitionist praxis. Underpinning a
range of activist interventions and organizing, these frameworks have
emphasized the ways in which the prison operates as one part of a
'mutually reinforcing web of social relationships' (Hart and Schlembach,
2015: 291) reproducing and shaping dominant forms of capitalist social
relations. They have documented the ways in which [the prison operates
as one part of a broader form of 'revanchist common sense']{.underline}
(Camp, 2016: 9), [legitimizing and naturalizing state power in the face
of threat or revolt]{.underline}. In doing so, such frameworks have
necessarily been attuned to continuities and discontinuities in penal
policies and the broader social relations they reproduce, for 'having a
longer historical perspective suggests some very different strategy
interventions and policy conclusions compared with an analysis which
focusses on relatively short-term historical trends' (Sim, 2020: 25).
Indeed, what is distinctive about Marxist abolitionism in this regard is
its ability to forge conjunctural analyses connecting contemporary and
historical struggles dialectically and waging them organically. For
example, in their landmark neo-Marxist British Prisons (first published
in 1979), Fitzgerald and Sim made it absolutely clear that 'to
understand the role that imprisonment plays, prisons must be seen within
the wider social, political and economic system in which they have been
developed' (Fitzgerald and Sim, 1982: 23). Continuing, they demonstrated
how [imprisonment serves a 'class-based legal system': reinforcing it,
legitimizing it and reproducing it symbiotically]{.underline}, all at
once. Discussing the notion of a 'prison crisis' at that particular
conjuncture, Fitzgerald and Sim (1982: 165) drew on Marxist conceptual
frameworks to show how in contrast to the analyses of a range of
political figures and liberal prison reform groups, 'the crisis in
British prisons ... is the crisis of reform'. In other words, the
contemporary prison system 'is the reformed prison system', they argued,
and, as such, the seeds of this crisis of reform were sown 'in the early
nineteenth century as part of the wider struggle to impose new forms of
class domination'. It is against such backdrops that Marxist frameworks
have been integral to building the conceptual tools necessary to build,
dialectically, the nonreformist reforms which foreground the primacy of
human need while simultaneously delegitimizing carceral sites and
logics. Indeed, these are among the lessons and tools taken up either
implicitly or explicitly by abolitionist campaigns and activist
movements today. Foregrounding the ways in which racialization,
bordering and the reproduction of violent social relations have been
integral to the formation of carceral states, Marxist frameworks have
been and are vital in struggles to 'meet human need and valorise the
right to life for all' (Scott, 2020: 227). Providing materialist
analysis of carcerality itself, neo-Marxist analyses such as those of
Mathiesen (1974) and Fitzgerald and Sim (1982) speak directly to
contemporary abolitionist voices while dialectically revealing how
[Marxism itself must incorporate an abolitionist imagination in order
for it to be emancipatory]{.underline}. At the current conjuncture --
marked by murderous inequality, multiple intersecting oppressions and
repressive state violence bound up directly with dominant forms of
accumulation -- these lessons have a particular, profound urgency. But
within Marxist abolitionist praxis, there are conceptual tools which
contribute to ensuring that this is an urgency that can be met. For
[[there can be no abolition within capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Mass plea bargaining destroys democracy with incentivized hyper incarceration to fuel carceral capitalism

As applied to contemporary plea bargaining, the accused is confronted
with an "oath" of sorts, in that they must assert their guilt before a
pros- ecutor and a judge. In addition, as with criminal procedure in the
Middle Ages, defendants confronting a plea have no right to know who
bore witness against them (United States v. Ruiz). But at least
contemporary defendants will know the charges against them, right? As I
presented in Chapter 1, sort of. When prosecutors engage in charge
stacking, meaning they accu- mulate as many charges as they can possibly
squeeze from the known facts regardless of whether they can prove those
charges beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, they engage in a practice of
"hiding the ball" that was com- mon in European ecclesiastical courts.
Opposite from the experience of our European ancestors who were not
informed of the charges they faced, currently in the United States
defendants are overwhelmed with too many charges. The result, however,
is the same: decisional ambiguity generated by the legitimate
representative of state power -- the prosecutor. The reasons for
supporting plea bargaining are circular. As I argued in this book, it is
legislatures in each of the states that control the naming of behavior
as criminal and who erect sentencing ranges for each category of crime.
So, [why are there "too many cases]{.underline}" to prosecute? [Because
legislatures tend to add to the list of criminal behaviors rather than
reducing them. The hydraulic effect is to require more arrests from
police and more cases to con- sider for adjudication by prosecutors. The
cycle is now complete. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges will
each be positioned to rightfully claim that there are simply too many
cases before them and not enough trial-related resources for each case
to realize its constitutional promise.]{.underline} This statement is
both true and not true. It is true that the sheer quantity of cases will
increase over time as legislatures add more crimes requiring
adjudication. It is also true that the additional cases will place
significant pressure upon criminal legal system actors and resources.
However, in two important ways, it is not true. First, prosecutors
should adhere to the American Bar Association guidelines regarding plea
bargaining.4 Second, as I established in Chapter 7, legislatures signify
the power of the state through governmentality and they should act in a
way that decriminalizes non-violent crimes, especially those relating to
marijuana possession and distribution, which across the United States
account for a significant proportion of felony convictions. In addition,
as I presented in Chapter 5, legislatures engage in the "coding of
capital" through their con- struction of draconian sentencing ranges. In
order to generate a rupture in the circular argument that justifies plea
bargaining, subjects acting within the civil society-lifeworld must
organize a power bloc to pressure legislatures to sig- nificantly reduce
mandatory maximum sentences. With mandatory maximum sentences reduced to
a more reasonable amount of incarceration (say 15 years for homicide),
the criminally accused will no longer be required to confront the
coercive trial tax when considering whether to assert their right to
trial. It is my contention that [once the trial tax is removed from
consideration, the United States may return to a greater sense of
democratic due process]{.underline}. In so doing, [criminal defendants
will be able to realize their constitutional rights protections under
the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth
Amendments]{.underline}. In addition to the obvious equal protection and
due process rights that are fully activated, [each case will include a

Our system of procedural checks and balances at trial is by no means
perfect. However, [[turning the Constitution]{.mark} and the Bill of
Rights [on their]{.mark} respective [heads]{.mark} [and eschewing them
for]{.mark} the [efficiency]{.mark} and predictability [of]{.mark}
contract-inspired [plea bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline} has gener- ated
a role within the criminal legal system for prosecutors that places them
squarely within the ambit of the Star Chamber. [[No more

facts**]{.mark}. No more [procedural right to know who is making a claim
against you]{.mark},]{.underline} or whether there is any material
impeachment evidence. [No real [investiga- tion]{.mark}.]{.underline}
And perhaps most important of all, [there exists no [institutional check
on the]{.mark} [executive]{.mark} power of the prosecutor to serve as
judge and jury]{.underline}. [Contemporary defendants are exposed to a
model of [the criminal legal]{.mark} [sys- tem premised upon the]{.mark}
factory [production line]{.mark}, [where efficiency]{.mark} and
predicta- bility of outcomes [are generated through routinized]{.mark}
[institutional autopoiesis]{.mark}]{.underline}. The plea is the norm.
It has emerged over the course of the last two centuries to contaminate
the democratic administration of justice like a slow-boiled frog.
Incrementally, over time, and not without support from the afflicted, as
can be expected from a hegemonic force, Americans have become par-
ticipants in the creation of what Weber referred to as their own "iron
cage." In the case of plea bargaining and incarceration, Weber's warning
is both literal and figurative as [the plea has accomplished both its
social control and profit-maximizing functions]{.underline}. With regard
to the latter, while we no longer exist in a world that is dominated by
industrial capitalism, [**[carceral capital- ism]{.mark}** has
[emerged]{.mark} [to perpetuate continued profit maximization through
mass or hyper-incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 [With formal
indentured servitude, surety systems, and vagrancy laws no longer
providing nascent capitalism [with a steady]{.mark} [stream of marginal
and impoverished bodies to exploit for profit]{.mark}, the politi- cal
economy of the criminal legal system transitioned to [criminal]{.mark}
[incarcera- tion as]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n emerging [profit-maximizing
enterprise]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 For Zatz, "[racialized mass
incarceration enables new forms of economic exploitation]{.underline}

kets."7 With the ease of conviction constitutive of [[plea

### Contention 9: Youth Plea Bargaining

#### Juvenile justice ought to not be bargained - it undermines rehabilitation

These distinguishing characteristics explain why we created juvenile
courts, and why we don't believe that kids in general should be
subjected to the adult criminal justice system. It should go without
saying that by creating a different justice system for kids, how we
treat them will also be different, and that should include how we
bargain for admissions. My solution is simple. [[**Eliminate** plea
bargaining in juvenile]{.underline} [court]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Plea
bargaining]{.underline} is one of those legal mechanisms that [has **no
place** in the juvenile justice]{.underline} [system]{.underline}. This
is the first of five columns about plea bargaining, its harmful effect
on youth and the community, and strategies on how to replace plea
bargaining with a process that will improve youth outcomes and enhance
public safety while simultaneously minimizing a congestion in court
dockets. But the conversation about the concerns with plea bargaining
drives a larger conversation around why a system of justice would be
married to a problematic technique that proves more harmful than helpful
for our kids and for the community. In short, this series of columns
calls for [juvenile justice systems]{.underline}, which [are still
**married** to the traditional plea-bargaining approach]{.underline} of
sentencing, to replace that with evidence-based tools that a growing
number of courts employ today. These tools include, for example,
validated [[risk and need]{.mark} [instruments]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[identify]{.mark} [which youth should be diverted from the]{.mark}
[courtroom]{.mark} and those who require supervision]{.underline}. But
more important is identifying what works that [[will reduce]{.mark} the
risk of [recidivism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The use of [[these tools
is]{.mark} **[prohibited]{.mark}**]{.underline} before arraignment on
charges because it requires soliciting personal and family-related
information. Some of that could be incriminating, which would violate
the youth's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. This means
that a system that employs [the]{.underline} traditional
[[plea-bargaining]{.mark} process]{.underline} in which the prosecutor
offers the youth a sweet deal to influence an admission and avoid a
trial [[is]{.mark} **far [less]{.mark}** [likely to identify the needs
of]{.mark} [the youth]{.mark} in order [to fashion a disposition]{.mark}
that is [best suited for the]{.mark} [youth and public
safety]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This will rock the world of
prosecutors and defense attorneys who are steeped in the traditional use
of plea bargaining because no longer will they play a significant role
in fashioning a disposition order on how the kid will be treated on
probation, or whether the kid should be committed to state custody. And
at the risk of offending them, they must be removed from negotiating
what's the best strategy to restore the youth because they have no clue
what's the best strategy for that youth. And, [if [prosecutors and
defense]{.mark} [attorneys are negotiating rehabilitative conditions
wearing a **blindfold**]{.mark}, how is that protecting the
public]{.underline}? It's not! This also means that prosecutors (And I
am talking about those who don't understand the rehabilitative goals of
the juvenile justice system) can no longer threaten harsher punishers to
coerce an admission by offering a sweeter deal if the kid admits.
Wouldn't it be something to have a system for [kids]{.underline} that
[allows them to [admit]{.mark} [because they know they are
guilty]{.mark}, and [not because they're afraid of]{.mark} [getting
slammed]{.mark} by the judge [for exercising their constitutional
rights]{.mark}]{.underline} set forth in In re Gault. [[It's losing the
**quid pro**]{.mark} **[quo]{.mark}**, or "something for something,"
negotiating a disposition, that scares prosecutors and defenders
alike]{.underline}, but for different reasons. Prosecutors enjoy
threatening a harsher punishment in exchange for an admission to avoid a
time-consuming trial. Defenders enjoy receiving a sweet deal from the
prosecutor to prevent harsher sentencing. Prosecutors don't have time to
prosecute every case and defenders have an obligation to represent their
youthful client zealously, and that means lighter sentences. "Really?"
they say out loud to my face, "Are you crazy?" Maybe I am, but it's a
"good crazy" I tell them with a smile. It only looks crazy because it's
a gigantic shift in practice, but it's a good shift because [it benefits
the kids and the community]{.underline} at the same time. [No longer is
a juvenile sentence fashioned **blindly** by two lawyers jockeying for
the best quid pro quo. In lieu of a disposition process driven by two
people bargaining for less than altruistic goals, a youth would be
engaged by a process that is constitutionally friendly. If they are
[adjudicated by]{.mark}]{.underline} admission or [[trial]{.mark}, they
[are subjected to an objective and individualized assessment to
determine what will work to improve]{.mark} the trajectory of the youth
and in turn enhance [the safety of the community]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Recommendations provided at a disposition by a court officer using
evidence-based tools remain subject to scrutiny by the prosecutor and
defender, including the right to present separate or controverting
evidence. Now that you know where I am going with this, and a little bit
about why, let's stop for now and take up the why in greater detail
later. I believe it to be advantageous to some, especially those
unfamiliar with plea bargaining (there are more folks than not who work
in the juvenile justice system outside the courtroom) to understand the
how, what, when and why of plea bargaining in order to understand why
plea bargaining in its traditional sense has no place in the juvenile
justice system. This series on plea bargaining can be likened to landing
a plane. This first column begins at the highest altitude by taking a
comprehensive look at plea bargaining, discussing its historical
development and the arguments for and against its use. The columns to
follow are analogous to the plane descending to its destination, as each
is devoted to a specific and exclusive facet of plea bargaining to help
the reader appreciate how plea bargaining works and explain in what ways
it is harmful, but also what a better system looks like and what
strategies work to transition to a better disposition process. Part 2
looks at the dynamics of how plea bargaining plays out and the role of
the judge, prosecutor, defense attorney and the law in the
plea-bargaining process. These dynamics can result in unintended
consequences as I will show by dissecting the true story of Mariah
Charles' brush with the law and her principled stand against the
prosecution. By the end of Part 2, the reader should be familiar enough
with plea bargaining to transition in Part Three to understand how
[[plea bargaining is **contrary** to the **rehabilitative goals**
of]{.mark} [the juvenile justice system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Part 3
will delve into what works to prevent delinquency and how plea
bargaining compromises what works for kids. Parts 4 and 5 focus on
practical approaches to implement the best practices shared in Part 3
and what an evidence-based juvenile court process looks like without
plea bargaining. In the beginning no plea bargaining

#### Juvenile plea bargaining convicts innocent children, depriving them of both familial bonds and rehabilitation

It is a case of mistaken identity, and unfortunately you happen to be in
the wrong place at the wrong time, which circumstantially lends credence
to the eyewitness account that you committed the crime. Pause --- yes,
this could really happen to you. It happens more than you think. One
study showed that 99.5% of all convictions are correct, but the 0.5%
wrongfully convicted totaled approximately 11,000 people. The percentage
of wrongful convictions may be low, but the raw numbers are
astronomical. Ironically, while drafting this essay I watched with
incredulity a news story of a young man wrongfully arrested and jailed
merely because he had the same name as the offender, but the accuser
gave the wrong date of birth, which matched that of the person
wrongfully accused. And so, it turned into a case of the po-po doing a
no-no and an innocent man going to jail. It wasn't until he got into the
courtroom that the accuser said, "This isn't him," but not until [after
he spent a month in jail that **cost him** his job]{.underline}. Back to
you. [After]{.underline} several [**months** in jail]{.underline}
(unless you can afford bail, if you're granted a bail amount, that is),
[your attorney informs you that the prosecutor is "offering," which is a
kinder and gentler word for "**threatening**]{.underline}," [to reduce
the charge and cut the length of prison time in half if you enter a
guilty plea knowing]{.underline} full well that [if you reject it
the]{.underline} state's [recommendation]{.underline} at sentencing [is
the maximum penalty]{.underline}, or close to it. "But I didn't do it.
They have the wrong guy," you shout. "I understand that," says your
lawyer, "but you look guilty. They have an eyewitness and you were near
the scene." In disbelief you angrily say to your lawyer, "So you're
telling me that [if I don't take the plea, the jury is likely going to
find me guilty]{.underline}?" "That pretty much sums it up," says your
lawyer. Been there, done that as a criminal defense lawyer. The dynamics
of plea bargaining This scenario typically plays out on the eve of
trial. Most courts schedule pretrial conferences the week before trial
to establish the case is ready for trial and to motivate defendants to
enter a guilty plea. In my day of practicing law, it was on Fridays. The
defense attorneys sat in the courtroom waiting for the bailiff to bring
us back to the judge's chamber, and as you turn the corner and enter the
chambers, there they are, the judge and prosecutor, lying in wait. I
don't mean to make the entire ordeal sound like a conspiracy when it's
not, but [to those attorneys who are representing one of those
**[11,000]{.mark}** [innocent]{.mark} folks who [need a shot at a jury
to convince them of]{.mark} their [innocence]{.mark}, plea bargaining
isn't a blessing, it's a **curse**]{.underline}. It's [within
that]{.underline} context of [representing the innocent]{.underline}
that [walking into the judge's]{.underline} [chamber makes
me]{.underline} a bit uneasy with this set-up, and sometimes it does
[feel like a **set-up**]{.underline}. In most other cases when
representing a guilty client and the evidence is beyond a reasonable
doubt and there are no legal objections like unreasonable searches and
seizures and inadmissible confessions, plea bargaining can be a friend
to everyone, including my client. But [when you]{.underline} know you
[have]{.underline} one of those few and far between [innocent clients,
plea bargaining is no longer a friend]{.underline}, [but your
enemy.]{.underline} And in those cases, the judge and prosecutor look
like co-conspirators. They don't mean to look that way, but the
plea-bargaining game makes it look that way. The object of the game for
the most part is to lighten the docket and move cases, and because most
defendants are guilty, they all look guilty. [If they all look guilty,
they need to take advantage of the state's gracious recommendation to
lay off the harshest punishment and enter what we call a "negotiated
plea]{.underline}." In my state of Georgia, and in the federal system,
judicial participation in the plea negotiation process is prohibited,
and for good reason. The U.S. Supreme Court in Boykin v. Alabama held
that a guilty plea must be knowingly and voluntarily entered. This
requires the judge to make inquiries of the defendant to determine if he
or she understands the nature of the charge, the rights being waived and
the consequences of the plea. Prohibiting judicial involvement in plea
negotiations removes the risk that the defendant may rely on a comment
made by the judge that could induce the defendant to enter the guilty
plea. An example of judicial participation gone awry occurred in a death
penalty case in a neighboring county of mine involving a seasoned and
veteran judge whom I have tried cases before on numerous occasions. The
judge told the prosecutor and defense counsel in the presence of the
defendant that he most likely would not impose the death penalty if he
were doing the sentencing. The defendant withdrew his not guilty plea
and waived his right to a jury for the sentencing phase. Apparently, the
judge changed his mind and sentenced the defendant to death. Our state
supreme court unanimously reversed. That wasn't a tough call. The court
explained that "Due to the force and majesty of the judiciary, a trial
court\'s participation in the plea negotiation may skew the defendant\'s
decision-making and render the plea involuntary because a defendant may
disregard proper considerations and waive rights based solely on the
trial court\'s stated inclination as to sentence." No doubt prohibiting
judicial participation is a good thing, but it is understood in the
system that entering a guilty plea will be rewarded. The judge may not
be directly involved in the negotiation process, but he or she is a
tacit partner in the process, waiting in the wings for the negotiated
plea to be delivered for sanctioning. Judges play role in guilty pleas
Our Georgia rules for sentencing expressly allow judges to be lenient to
those defendants who enter a guilty plea. Judges can't participate in
the negotiation, but they are allowed (and the overburdened dockets
encourage them) to sanction lighter sentences, which fuels plea
bargaining. You can't negotiate pleas if you don't have a system that
invites judges to accept what was negotiated. No matter how many rules
and court opinions are issued limiting the direct participation of
judges in the negotiation process, they do play a role that encourages
defendants to enter a guilty plea. And I am not saying that is a bad
thing. For the most part it is a good thing. I play this role out when I
am taking pleas in adult court. But what is an innocent but
guilty-looking defendant to do in a system that rewards those who enter
a guilty plea with a lighter sentence and punishes the others who go to
trial? And I also wonder if any of those defendants entering a guilty
plea in front of me were innocent. A lawyer once said, "There is no
client as scary as an innocent man." That is true, and to a judge there
is no defendant as scary as an innocent one. There is no way for a judge
to determine for sure that the defendant standing before him or her
entering a negotiated plea is guilty. [While plea negotiations are
taking place in the halls of the courthouse, us judges are sitting on
the bench looking "fat, dumb, and happy," passively awaiting the next
plea]{.underline} to walk into the courtroom. [All we can do is ask the
statutory and constitutional questions of the defendant]{.underline}: if
he is entering his guilty plea freely and voluntarily after first
explaining his right to a trial, the state's burden of proof, his right
against self-incrimination and so on. So long as the defendant
understands their rights and acknowledges that their plea is freely and
voluntarily made, [the judge has no choice but to accept
it]{.underline}. We will never know those attorney-client conversations.
I think comedian Lenny Bruce aptly described our criminal justice system
when he said, "In the halls of justice, the only justice is in the
halls," especially considering the fact that most criminal cases are
disposed of by negotiated pleas worked out in the halls of courthouses.
It doesn't take long once you start practicing criminal defense to
discover [there is no guarantee that when you come across the innocent
client that the jury will believe they are innocent]{.underline}. After
all, the burden on the state isn't to prove that the defendant is guilty
beyond all doubt, but beyond a reasonable doubt. Stated another way, and
to place this in perspective, [the state doesn't have to prove that you
are guilty, only that you look guilty enough for a jury not to have
reasonable doubt]{.underline}. [[There is room for
error]{.underline}]{.mark} in our system of criminal justice, and
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} degree of [error [can send people]{.mark} to
prison for life, or [to their grave]{.mark}]{.underline}. Take, for
example, how many people have been wrongfully convicted on eyewitness
testimony, sent to prison and later exonerated on DNA evidence. [The
[Innocence]{.mark} Project has used DNA evidence to exonerate **358**
[defendants]{.mark}]{.underline}. These are people who fell through the
margin of error crack in our criminal justice system. Imagine the
thoughts and feelings these 358 people endured as they sat in jail
awaiting trial and sentencing knowing they were innocent of the crime
they were accused of. [Many opted to [plead guilty because they were
**threatened** with]{.mark} [a sentence they couldn't bear]{.mark} if
they opted to go to trial]{.underline}. Innocent mother pleaded guilty I
recently presided over a dependency case involving a mother accused by
her daughter of physical abuse. The police arrived and arrested the
mother for felony cruelty to children. The state's attorney presented a
certified copy of the mother's sentence to five years' probation, a
sentence she pled guilty to. In dependency court the standard of proof
is clear and convincing evidence, which is less than the highest
standard used in criminal cases --- beyond a reasonable doubt. The
mother's guilty plea was enough to support a finding of dependency in
juvenile court. But I want to know more because I want to know why. I
can't fix the problem unless I know why people did what brought them
before me. If we don't ask why, our responses to fixing the problem will
always be limited to the symptoms and not the reasons that manifest the
symptoms. By asking why, I learned additional undisputed facts that
created a legal justification for the mother to use force to restrain
her daughter. It turned out the daughter was running away to an adult
male to have sex. Mom had called the police twice that day to find her
and bring her home. They did, but once the police left, the mother
caught the daughter sneaking out for a third time and so she did what
any concerned and loving parent would do, she blocked her daughter from
leaving. The daughter wasn't about to let anyone, including her mother,
keep her away from the man she loved. Poor girl, she was afflicted by
that age-old adolescent syndrome called puppy love, but had no clue that
the adult man had other things in mind with her, and romance, love and
affection was not part of that repertoire of things. So the daughter
attacked her mother, but in the mother's attempt to restrain her they
fell to the ground and a physical struggle ensued, causing scratches to
the daughter. During the struggle it was the mother who directed her son
to call 911, and he did. When the police arrived, they arrested the
mother because of the marks on the daughter. In Georgia, reasonable
discipline is an affirmative defense to a crime alleging battery or
something similar, and using reasonable force to restrain one's child
from running away into the bedroom of an adult male would constitute
reasonable discipline or force. I asked the mother why she entered a
guilty plea after having been told by her attorney that she could argue
to the jury that she was justified to restrain her daughter from running
away again. "I can't afford to take that chance and end up in prison for
one year," she replied as she was holding back tears. "I wanted to go
home and that was important to me at the time." I dismissed the
dependency case against her, concluding the evidence was not enough to
meet the clear and convincing standard. If it wasn't enough to convict
her in my court, it wasn't enough in criminal court. But what is an
innocent defendant to do when threatened with prison if she doesn't
accept the plea and there is no guarantee that a jury will return a
verdict of not guilty? There is something devilish about a system that
relies on rewards, threats and coercion to operate a system that in
theory promotes justice, a concept in American jurisprudence that we
give a lot of lip service to. Not all outcomes match what comes from our
lips. Mariah Charles: Principle over convenience This "devilish"
sentiment about plea bargaining brings me full circle to Mariah Charles,
who I referenced in my previous column\] to begin this discussion on the
inherent evils of plea bargaining, especially in the juvenile court.
Mariah was walking to school with her friend when they were stopped by
two police officers with the New York Police Department. They asked the
two girls where they were going and Mariah pointed to her school a
half-block away and said, "To school." Apparently, the fact that they
were walking in the direction of a school that was visible a half-block
away, and that they were carrying book bags, was not enough to convince
the officers that the girls were walking to school. So the officers
asked for identification, which Mariah didn't have (and state law
doesn't require she possess an ID). Mariah explained she didn't have
identification but told them they could accompany them to the school,
whereupon she proceeded to walk toward the school. Mariah was willing to
offer them the best evidence to show her intent to walk to school and
that she and her friend were not truants, which the officers would later
claim was their purpose in stopping them. But having a legitimate
purpose to stop a person on the street becomes irrelevant when the
direct evidence, obvious to the officers, reveals no crime has occurred
or is about to occur (i.e. walking with book bags in direction of school
that is in plain sight). And in what way was Mariah's offer for them to
follow her half a block to the school unreasonable? It wasn't, and it's
decisions like this made by just enough officers that has created the
problem facing police today --- lack of legitimacy. To make it worse,
one of the officers grabbed Mariah by the arm and forcibly stopped her
in her tracks. Mariah again told them she was walking to school and that
they could follow her. She continued to walk toward the school. How dare
a teenage girl tell the police what is best, so they both grabbed her,
physically restrained her, took her to the ground and threw her in the
back of the patrol car. The irony of Mariah's situation is that she can
resist arrest when the arrest is not authorized. States vary on when a
person can resist arrest, but New York Penal Code § 205.30 states that
"A person is guilty of resisting arrest when he intentionally prevents
or attempts to prevent a police officer or peace officer from effecting
an authorized arrest of himself or another person." In other words, for
a person to be guilty of resisting arrest, the police must have
reasonable suspicion that the person committed a crime. The appellate
courts in New York have set forth a "\... well established principle
that whether the police have reasonable suspicion depends on the entire
circumstances of each case." These same courts in New York have held
that the fact a person is seen leaving or even fleeing from a scene is
by itself not enough to create reasonable suspicion. There must be more.
Mariah was arrested for resisting arrest, but not for any underlying
crime that would create the reasonable suspicion required to arrest
Mariah. No crime, no reasonable suspicion. It begs the question of why
Mariah was arrested for merely walking away from the officers. Unlike
the facts in the appellate cases cited above in which people ran from
the police and the arrests were still found unlawful, Mariah was polite
and asked the officers to follow her to the school. In other words, the
prosecutor didn't have a case in the first place that allowed them to
offer any recommendation of any kind to Mariah, but they did so anyway.
They offered the lightest punishment under the law: An Adjournment in
Contemplation of Dismissal, or commonly referred to as an ACD in New
York. It's a deferred prosecution program, also called a diversion. In
New York it means that if you keep your nose clean for six months after
pleading guilty, the charge is dismissed. This didn't smell right to
Mariah. I can imagine Mariah thinking to herself upon hearing the
prosecutor's offer, "Sure, it may sound great, and it may look a lot
better than probation or jail, but I am not guilty." I think of my own
daughter in Mariah's shoes. As a father my response would be a bit
unpolished --- "Hey, don't piss on my shoes and tell me it's raining." I
would likely throw into the mix of my inflammatory commentary, "My
daughter already has a case against the officers for violating her civil
rights pursuant to 42 US Code §1983. Keep pushing it and she'll have
another one against you \[prosecutor\] for malicious prosecution." But
that is part of the problem with plea bargaining. The accused usually
don't have legal training and they don't have fathers like me who were
trial attorneys who specialized in civil rights cases (I did work for
our Attorney General's Office representing state employees in Section
1983 lawsuits). They are scared, and if they are innocent, they are
frightened, and when they are frightened, they freeze and give in to the
threats of the prosecutor. Mariah may be youthful and without legal
skills, but what she does have is an incorruptible and principled
character. That style of character is a source that delivers courage,
which she displayed by rejecting the "sweet" deal and risking a stiffer
penalty and a criminal record. Fortunately for Mariah, the prosecutor
blinked and dismissed the charge. But not all prosecutors are wise
enough to always recognize when their zealousness becomes too zealous
and blinds them. When this occurs, they can't separate the forest from
the trees, or in the case of prosecutors, they can't separate the
justice from the injustice. Where do we go from here? What does it say
about how we do justice in the hallways of our courthouses knowing that
about [11,000 people are wrongfully accused each year]{.underline}? It
begs the question of whether there is a better way of doing plea
negotiations. But knowing that [innocent folks are pleading guilty to
crimes they didn't do --- because they are afraid of]{.underline} what
will happen to them if they exercise their Sixth Amendment right to a
jury [trial]{.underline} --- [[what does that say]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
those of us in **[juvenile justice]{.mark}** where systems]{.underline}
still [employ]{.underline} a traditional
**[plea-bargaining]{.underline}** process[? It's one thing to do this to
adults, but [to allow it to happen to kids should be
**intolerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And I don't want to hear the
excuse that the impact is not harmful because the juvenile justice
system is rehabilitative and we don't punish. That's hogwash! Try
explaining that to a kid who is told by his attorney that the state will
not recommend commitment to state custody if he enters an admission to
the burglary, but will instead recommend probation and he can stay at
home. If he one of those 11,000 innocent souls, what he hears instead is
this: "[[If I say I am guilty to something I didn't do, you won\'t **rip
me away** from my family, friends, and school]{.mark} [and send
me]{.mark} [to]{.mark} some far-off place [with
strangers]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[There is nothing]{.mark}
[rehabilitative about this]{.mark} scenario regardless how much we
repeat to ourselves that the system is rehabilitative. [No innocent
person]{.mark}, young or old, [should be removed]{.mark} [from their
home for a crime they didn't do]{.mark}. We can't rehabilitate someone
who doesn't need rehabilitation because they're innocent]{.underline} in
the first place. But it's more than ripping away an innocent kid from
the arms of his family. It's also about the kids who are guilty and
restoring them to a healthy existence. [[Plea bargaining **deprives**
those who are guilty from receiving the best rehabilitative
services]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is impossible to negotiate what
works]{.underline} for any given youthful offender, which is explained
in the next column.

#### Rehabilitation comes first for juvenile justice because adolescent brains are uniquely moldable to lower recidivism, plea bargaining prevents rehabilitation

Prosecutor: Nope. Not on a battery on a teacher. Take the offer to your
client. If he wants a trial, that's his right, but it's my right to ask
that he be committed to the state. The law requires the attorney to
inform the client of an offer made by the prosecutor. Most likely
[Johnny will succumb to the prosecutor's threat and admit to the
battery]{.underline} on a teacher, [despite the fact that the other kid
is a bully and physically attacked Johnny]{.underline}. People,
especially [kids]{.underline}, [will do]{.underline} about
**[anything]{.underline}** [to avoid]{.underline} going to jail or
[prison]{.underline}. Even though there is no guarantee that the judge
will follow the prosecutor's recommendation, who really wants to roll
the dice to find out? Don't forget what I said in my previous column
about us judges. These conversations are taking place outside our
hearing in the courthouse hallways. We're on the bench sitting there
"fat, dumb and happy," waiting for the next admission to enter the
courtroom. Now, I seriously doubt that I would commit Johnny to the
state even if the prosecutor recommended it, but here is the rub: Johnny
doesn't know that because I am in the courtroom looking fat, dumb and
happy and have no clue what's transpiring in the so-called "halls of
justice." [Johnny will be scared into admitting to a crime he is
innocent]{.underline} of based on the legal defense of justification. By
the time he walks into my courtroom, [all I know is that he will be
admitting to a felony battery on a teacher]{.underline}, which sounds
pretty awful, and the recommendation is probation, which seems
understandable given the nature of the offense. The prosecutor during
the plea colloquy will give a factual basis to support the battery
charge, but he or she isn't going to include the bullying drama leading
up to the school fight. And [so, we can add another soul to the 11,000
wrongfully convicted each year. [There is too]{.mark} much at stake when
gambling with your freedom, and especially when it comes to
kids]{.underline}. [[The idea of being]{.mark} [**taken away** from
family and friends **takes a toll**]{.mark} [on the adolescent]{.mark}
[psyche]{.mark}.]{.underline} The scenario above is no different than
what happens in adult court in those cases where the defendant is truly
innocent. Whether you're a kid or an adult, [[a system that]{.mark}
[allows for **threats** and **coercion** to force an innocent person to
plead]{.mark} [guilty is]{.mark} a **[dysfunctional]{.mark}**
system]{.underline} to some extent. [[Treating juveniles differently is
fair]{.mark}]{.underline} But it's at this juncture that the adult and
juvenile courts diverge slightly because negotiating sentencing options
within the juvenile justice context takes on a more sinister role. What
makes juvenile courts unique from adult courts is the nature of [the
adolescent brain.]{.underline} Despite the highly intelligent and
creative functioning of the teenage brain, [there are valid reasons why
[we don't allow teens to drink]{.mark} until they reach [21]{.mark} and
restrict their access to other "adult"-type enjoyments. The U.S. Supreme
Court in **Miller v. Alabama** acknowledged the **uniqueness of
teens**]{.underline}, stating that [[adolescence is marked by]{.mark}
"**[transient rashness]{.mark}**, [proclivity for **risk**, and
**inability** to assess consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}," and
concluded that [[these]{.mark} are factors that should
**[mitigate]{.mark}** the [punishment received by juvenile]{.mark}
[defendants]{.mark}. Teenagers are highly intelligent humans, but
neurologically wired to do **stupid** things]{.underline}. I don't mean
any disrespect to teens when I say this about them, because doing stupid
things is a far cry from being stupid. [The teenage brain]{.underline}
is a paradox because research shows that [our [brains]{.mark} possess
the most fluid intelligence during our teens, while the [prefrontal
cortex]{.mark}, which translates emotion into logic, [is not
developed]{.mark}, [leading to]{.mark} a **proneness** for
**risk-taking** behaviors and making [**poor**
**choices**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Examples of this paradox includes Mark
Zuckerberg, who created Facebook by age 20; Albert Einstein, whose first
contemplations of the law of relativity began at 16; and then there is
Taylor Swift for the country music fans. She left home at 14 and headed
to Nashville to begin her music career. Despite the brilliance and
creativity of these teenagers, they still were not allowed to buy an
adult beverage (except maybe Einstein) until their 21st birthday. Their
teenage brilliance has improved our quality of life in different ways,
but their prefrontal lobe cortex is why they couldn't enjoy certain
adult allowances. Similar to why [laws exist that limit teens from
enjoying adult gratifications, our legislatures have created a [separate
juvenile justice]{.mark} system to accommodate this neurological paradox
that [allows for]{.mark}]{.underline} two things to occur: 1)
[[mitigation in sentencing]{.mark} that is **age
appropriate**]{.underline} by taking into consideration that teens are
still under neurological construction; and 2) [[treatment]{.mark} is
[emphasized over punishment]{.mark} to take advantage of the teenager's
neurological maturation process]{.underline}. In other words, [[if
the]{.mark} teen [brain is under]{.mark} [construction]{.mark}, it also
means [it's more amenable to redirection]{.mark}, provided we do so
using what works]{.underline}. [This requires juvenile justice systems
to know what works to prevent and treat delinquency]{.underline}. And
for courts that wish to implement what works with fidelity, the rub is
that [[**plea bargaining** becomes an]{.mark}
**[obstacle]{.mark}**]{.underline} because it occurs before the
information that is needed about the kid can be gathered to determine
what will work for him. Like the proverbial cart without a horse, [[the
system will]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [be]{.mark} able to move the
[restorative]{.mark} needle in a positive direction [if it]{.mark}
[depends on]{.mark} two [lawyers negotiating]{.mark} how to respond to a
kid's delinquent conduct [without]{.mark} first [assessing whether the
kid requires]{.mark} [court intervention]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}. And assuming the kid does require court
intervention, the lawyers have no clue what that intervention should
look like other than their instinct. In an evidence-based juvenile
justice system, [[objective risk and needs assessment instruments are
**essential** to informing]{.mark} [the]{.mark} court on the **[best
response]{.mark}** to address a kid's delinquent conduct]{.underline}.
Does the kid need to be diverted from the formal process and if not,
does the kid require supervision in the community or out-of-home
placement? The nightmare for any judge is to place an innocent kid on
probation, or worse, remove him from his family and friends, but it's
also harmful to place kids who were delinquent on probation who don't
need it. And it's also harmful to place kids on probation who do need
it, but don't get the appropriate services to address the underlying
causes of their conduct. There is great risk in negotiating dispositions
as part of a process to secure a guilty plea because it's the blind
leading the blind when there are no tools to guide the decision-making
process. The remainder of this column is dedicated to understanding
evidence-based systems, or what is dubbed the "What Works" literature.
But ironically, the path to "What Works" began with an article dubbed
"Nothing Works." From nothing works to what works

#### Plea bargaining causes youth crime -- overresponse to low level crime, and decreased focus on high level crime. Georgia proves

**Teske 20** \[Steven Teske, chief judge of the Juvenile Court of
Clayton County and adjunct professor at Pima Community College in Tucson

[How plea-bargaining can harm public]{.underline} [safety]{.underline} I
can't tell you how often [probation]{.underline}
[administrators]{.underline} around the country have
[expressed]{.underline} to me their [frustration over kids placed
on]{.underline} [probation who have no business under
supervision]{.underline}. Many are [the result of]{.underline} these
negotiated [pleas]{.underline}. I recall one administrator complaining,
"[I don't know what]{.underline} they \[[prosecutors, defenders and
judges\] expect us to do with some of these kids who don't need
our]{.underline} [services]{.underline}. [It's a **waste
of**]{.underline} our [**time** and it doesn't help the
kid]{.underline}." These well-informed administrators are referring to a
phenomena I've coined "**[[hyper-recidivism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
which [[results]{.mark} [when a system responds to **low-risk**
juvenile]{.mark} offenders [with
**hyper-responsivity**]{.mark}]{.underline} (more treatment than is
required) [[that]{.underline} **[aggravates]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [offender's [psyche and induces a greater risk
to reoffend]{.mark} that was not present in the beginning]{.underline}.
When this occurs, the system is responsible for increasing crime. The
administrator's reference to "a waste of our time" is the flip side of
this coin. [The one side influences hyper-recidivism that turns kids
into criminals while the other side dilutes the supervision of high-risk
youth by [flooding]{.mark} [probation with low-risk youth]{.mark} [who
don't require supervision]{.mark}]{.underline}. Probation officers are
not able to deliver the supervision needed for high-risk youth when
[they are spinning their wheels watching over low-risk youth who are
likely not to reoffend]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} if they do
[it's]{.underline} [a]{.underline}nother [minor offense]{.underline}.
When the former occurs, [the system fails to reduce the risk of
reoffending among high-risk youth]{.underline} and when the latter
occurs, the system produces higher-risk youth. It's a double whammy on
public safety. The "What Works" research has informed many of us who are
paying attention that [this two-sided coin of [plea bargaining
prescribes a **double dose** of]{.mark} [medicines that **don't
work**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It wouldn't be a problem if the medicines
were ineffective, but sadly [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} work together to
act as deadly toxins that [[adulterate the juvenile justice system and
endanger public safet]{.mark}y]{.underline}. [It makes for more victims,
not fewer]{.underline}. If this were the practice of medicine, doctors
would be losing their licenses for committing medical malpractice, which
begs this question: Considering the fact that there exists a body of
evidence-based studies supporting what works to prevent delinquency and
reduce recidivism, is it time to create minimum standards of practice in
the field of juvenile justice? That discussion is for another day, but
for now it's safe to say that we can avoid systemic negligence that
endangers public safety by implementing evidence-based programs while
simultaneously building an infrastructure that ensures implementation
with fidelity. [[The **first**]{.mark} **[step]{.mark}** in that
direction requires [the **elimination** of plea
bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, when I became a judge in
Clayton County, Ga., [[in 1999]{.mark}, juvenile crime was on the climb
and [recidivist rates]{.mark} among probationers [were]{.mark} a
staggering [76%]{.mark}]{.underline}. It took me through 2002 to figure
out what to do with the help of juvenile justice consultants like former
Denver juvenile court Judge Ted Rubin and folks at the Annie E. Casey
Foundation leading the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative like
Bart Lubow and Gail Mumford, and a number of JDAI leaders including Rick
Jensen in Multnomah County, Ore. (Portland); Scott MacDonald of Santa
Cruz, Calif.; Michael Rohan and William Siffermann of Cook County, Ill.
(Chicago) and others. My point is that no one owns their own revolution
that leads to sweeping changes. Those waging war on harmful traditions
(the establishment) are inspired by others who have waged revolutionary
changes in their own land. I already had a fire underneath me burning
for change, but these folks threw more gas on my fire and by 2003 it was
time to call out our system for what it was --- a sham! And it was time
to take those flames and torch the old system and rebuild from scratch.
The first thing I did was eliminate the negotiation of dispositions and
institute an [evidence-based]{.underline} disposition process in which
our newly validated risk and needs instrument would drive the
recommendations for disposition. To this day, the [recommendations
generated from the assessment tools create a rebuttable
presumption]{.underline}, meaning [the recommendation becomes the
disposition unless rebutted by evidence presented by the state's
attorney or the defender or upon the court's own motion]{.underline}.
This change coupled with others reduced the number of kids placed on
probation by 72% between 2003 and now, which reduced the average
caseload size from 125 to 25 probationers. [[Probation officers target
**only** high-risk youth]{.mark} with intensive services [because these
are]{.mark} the youth [identified by]{.mark} the risk and needs
assessment [tool]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[By]{.mark} [reducing probation
caseload size from **125 to 25,**]{.mark} the [officers]{.mark} enjoy
more time to [**engage** the youth and families **one-on-one**]{.mark}
[through family conferencing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Each youth is
matched to an evidence-based program]{.underline} according to the risk
factors identified through their assessments. [These [changes
strengthened]{.mark} the [supervision]{.mark} of high-risk offenders [by
ending the flow of lower-risk kids to probation that]{.mark}
**[distracted]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[officers]{.underline}]{.mark}
[from]{.underline} providing the intensive services required to effect a
positive change in [high-risk kids]{.underline}. The
[[strength]{.underline}]{.mark} in supervision [[is evidenced by the
reduction in recidivist rates **by 36%**]{.underline}]{.mark} among
probationers in Clayton County between 2003 and now. There is no doubt
that [[stopping]{.mark} the flow of [low-risk offender]{.mark}s to
[probation]{.mark} by increasing diversion in Clayton County has
influenced the [reduction in delinquency filings by **82%**]{.mark}
between 2003 and now]{.underline}. More significant is [[the reduction
of felony filings by **64%.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Consider what these
numbers mean within the context of public safety; that a 64% reduction
in felonious crimes committed by juveniles means [there are 64% fewer
victims today than the day before]{.underline} we implemented our
reforms, which included [the elimination of wholesale plea
bargaining]{.underline}. These reductions are not unique to my county.
Other places have experienced astonishing reductions in juvenile crime.
[The most significant factor is keeping kids from entering the juvenile
justice system in the first place]{.underline}. Mike Males, who is
senior research fellow for the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice
in San Francisco, wrote several columns about juvenile crime plummeting
in California: "[State and local [juvenile]{.mark} [detention
systems]{.mark} that [subject youth to **abuses**]{.mark} [and **wasted
days**]{.mark} don't deserve credit for decreasing crime]{.underline}.
[[Once they enter the system]{.mark}, the [recidivism]{.mark} rates of
youth [remain the same]{.mark} as in the past]{.underline}. Rather,
crime fell because hundreds of thousands fewer youth in California are
entering the system in the first place, particularly at the youngest
ages." [Juvenile justice systems will never reduce juvenile crime unless
they work on both ends of the system]{.underline}. On the front end
[[they must]{.mark} [stop]{.mark} allowing so many [kids to enter the
system]{.mark}; [**plea** **bargaining** is a]{.mark} contributing
[factor]{.mark}]{.underline}, among other reasons. On the back end
[[they]{.mark} [must target only high-risk youth]{.mark} using
appropriate programs that meet the needs of the youth, and again [plea
bargaining is an **obstacle**]{.mark}]{.underline} to this occurring.
But how does this happen? It doesn't happen without political will. And
assuming enough political will can be mustered by community
stakeholders, the process of change to an evidence-based system requires
what I call the Three Ps that make up the backbone of system reform:
partnership, persistence and patience. These three Ps will sustain
political will to keep the effort moving forward indefinitely, which is
the key to inevitable success to change systems. The next column takes
this plane to the ground where we discuss the practical and concrete
strategies for system change.

#### Post-plea bargaining youth treatment solves crime by addressing criminogenic needs found out during trials -- minimal info, conduct focused plea deals don't discover what the individual problem is, making the generalized treatment fail

Clayton County and adjunct professor at Pima Community College in Tucson

[We can't negotiate evidence-based programs]{.underline}, practices A
growing number of juvenile courts have introduced evidence-based
programs and practices thanks to initiatives to reform juvenile justice
systems on a statewide basis. Public policy and research foundations
over the past decade were either invited by a governor to render
assistance to reform their juvenile justice system or persuaded by them.
These statewide reforms introduced evidence-based programs and in so
doing necessitated a change in process and procedure. Like many things
that work, they require certain prerequisites before implementation, and
what works to reduce reoffending among offenders is no exception. For
example, we know that [[there are]{.mark} several specific underlying
[causes of criminal behaviors]{.mark} that are referred to as
[criminogenic **needs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For juveniles they
include family function, cognition, peers, substance abuse, weak
problem-solving skills and school-connectedness]{.underline}. I predict
that --- with the growing body of research on adverse childhood
experiences --- childhood trauma may one day be included, or at least
factored into the family function risk factor. Stated in another way,
the "What Works" [research]{.underline} has [identified protective
buffers that minimize the risk of delinquent conduct]{.underline}, which
are the criminogenic needs. [By knowing what factors reduce the risk of
offending, [we can identify in each child]{.mark}, using a risk and
needs assessment tool, [which]{.mark} of these protective [buffers are
lacking]{.mark} [and **target** them]{.mark} using evidence-based
programs designed to enhance and strengthen them]{.underline}. This
preliminary **[[evaluation]{.underline}]{.mark}** stage
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[because
there is no way to determine what]{.mark} program [will work]{.mark} for
any given youth [without]{.mark} first [knowing what caused the
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, if the assessment shows
family function is a risk factor, then we know that certain
evidence-based programs like family functional therapy or multi-systemic
therapy are appropriate. [Applying a program that doesn't match the
kid's criminogenic needs is a **waste** of taxpayer monies and is not
only **ineffective** to reduce the delinquent conduct but may also
**aggravate** the circumstances and make the child
**worse**]{.underline}. What we do to rehabilitate a youth is no
different than how epidemiologists study diseases for prevention and
eradication. They [[identify]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[at-risk
population and]{.underline}]{.mark} become familiar with the affected
population to [[determine the]{.mark} underlying]{.underline}
[[causes]{.underline}]{.mark} of the disease. [[This allows]{.mark} them
to identify [individual treatment]{.mark}]{.underline} modalities.
Although behaviors are not diseases, they behave like them. Like
diseases, [[delinquent behaviors]{.mark} do not occur by chance
[and]{.mark} they are [not randomly distributed]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[There are]{.mark} **[always]{.mark}** underlying
**[determinants]{.mark}** for delinquent behaviors]{.underline}.
Delinquent behaviors are a symptom of something else. Historically the
problem with our justice system is that we respond to symptoms and not
causes, and so the symptoms (behaviors) persist. This is where Martinson
got it right though he didn't know it. There are programs that work, but
we had not found them yet because we were focused on symptomology and
not causality. When kids do bad things and we don't ask why, our
tendency will be to always respond to the conduct and not to the cause,
which typically will take the shape of punishment and not treatment.
This explains why [[recidivism rates are]{.mark} [higher in a system
that doesn't employ evidence-based practices]{.mark} and programs, and
this gets us back to **[plea bargain]{.mark}ing**.]{.underline} [How can
a system that employs evidence-based programs do so with fidelity if the
disposition [has]{.mark} already [been negotiated]{.mark} by a
prosecutor and defender [without knowing the]{.mark} kid's [risks and
needs]{.mark}]{.underline}? [**It** **can't**]{.underline}. And [[the
system can't]{.mark} [deliver]{.mark} to them [info]{.mark}rmation that
[can only be obtained during the]{.mark} [disposition]{.mark} stage of
delinquency proceedings, [which comes after]{.mark} the
[guilt/innocence]{.mark} stage]{.underline}. [Plea bargaining occurs in
the guilt/innocence phase. Gathering information on the youth occurs
during the disposition phase after which the youth is adjudicated
guilty]{.underline}. This is because accused kids are presumed innocent
until proven guilty, which means they remain silent and no one can force
information from them. [[If they're silent]{.mark}, that means
[evaluative tools]{.mark} like risk and needs, psychological evaluations
and other disposition reports [are]{.mark} strictly
**[prohibited]{.mark}** [because]{.mark} it is violative of the kid's
**[Fifth Amendment]{.mark}** right against
self-incrimination]{.underline}. Some may argue that their system isn't
negatively affected by plea negotiations because negotiated
recommendations are limited to the type of supervision status, such as
probation or commitment to state custody, and the type of treatment is
left to the probation agency or facility. But this presupposes that
[risk and needs instruments]{.underline} don't [recommend probation or
commitment]{.underline}, and many do. In Georgia, for example, a kid
can't be committed to state custody without a risk and needs assessment
having been performed. [Our risk and needs assessments do make
recommendations on whether the kid should be placed on community
supervision or commitment to state custody]{.underline}, and for how
long. Still, many [states prohibit probation authorities]{.underline},
who generally are part of the local or state executive function, [to
direct a probationer to participate in a program not ordered by the
court]{.underline}. Beyond the general conditions of probation that
apply to all probationers, such as report times, curfew or refraining
from using alcohol and drugs, [[only a]{.mark} [court can add a]{.mark}
special [condition to participate in a program that targets a
criminogenic need]{.mark}]{.underline}. This prohibition exists [because
it conforms to the separation of powers doctrine as well as basic due
process requirements]{.underline}. Regarding the former, an executive
authority cannot add conditions of probation without court approval
because it's an order and that is strictly a judicial function.
Regarding the latter, the juvenile defendant has a right to know what is
expected of him while serving probation, which mandates the judge to
give him notice and an opportunity to be heard. Should the defendant
resist the request to add a special condition, but the judge concludes
that the condition is reasonably related to the kid's rehabilitation,
the judge may opt to take another pathway, such as commitment to state
custody. Probation is not a right, it's a privilege that can be denied
or later revoked. No matter how it's sliced, the best practice
supporting a system utilizing evidence-based programs is one that
excludes the lawyers from negotiating the disposition. The
evidence-based tools used to develop a recommended disposition guides
the judge to the ultimate issue, which only the judge can decide ---
what is the most appropriate response that will rehabilitate the youth?
The state, by and through the prosecutor, and the accused youth, by and
through the defender, has the right to challenge the recommendation and
controvert its finding by presenting evidence and making arguments, but
they don't have the right to negotiate the disposition before the
evidence-informed recommendation has been tendered. Nowhere in the
Constitution is plea bargaining a sanctioned procedure, and just because
it has become a custom and practice doesn't make it an effective
practice when it comes to protecting public safety.

#### Youth plea bargains are extra coercive given their less-developed brain, smaller knowledge base, and bias from family

Plea-bargaining, in which the prosecution offers a reduced sentence to a
defendant in exchange for a guilty plea (Zottoli et al., Citation2016),
is used to settle the vast majority of criminal and juvenile cases in
the United States (Durose & Langan, Citation2005). Although
[plea-bargaining is the most common method of juvenile
adjudication]{.underline}, [[youth]{.underline}]{.mark} in the legal
system [present a special challenge because they [may
lack]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [understanding of legal concepts]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the basic [decision-making]{.mark} skills]{.underline}
[necessary to function effectively in plea bargain contexts]{.underline}
(Daftary-Kapur & Zottoli, Citation2014; Kaban & Quinlan,
Citation2004).[[Youth]{.underline}]{.mark} as a class [[have **reduced
capacity**]{.mark} to understand and appreciate plea
processes]{.underline}, which may increase with age and experience in
the legal system---[[and]{.mark} therefore they [may be **unable** to
make informed plea decisions independently]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Daftary-Kapur & Zottoli, Citation2014; Grisso et al., Citation2003;
Kaban & Quinlan, Citation2004). Youth also are more likely to make risky
decisions---and their decisions mainly focus on short-term gain, with
less emphasis placed on long-term consequences (Fountain & Woolard,
Citation2017). Perhaps [because of youths' **developmental
immaturity**]{.underline}, research suggests [[they may]{.mark}
[**over-weight** the opinions of others]{.mark} in making decisions
regarding plea deals]{.underline} (Fountain & Woolard, Citation2017;
Viljoen et al., Citation2005). Given the extent to which [[youth are
**susceptible** to]{.mark} the influence of [authority
figures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Richardson et al., Citation1995) and the
degree to which [they rely on their legal guardians and attorneys for
advice in legal proceedings]{.underline} (Fountain & Woolard,
Citation2017; Viljoen et al., Citation2005), factors that influence
these advisors may ultimately bear a substantial impact on youth
decisions. In other words, youths' decisions cannot be fully understood
without also considering the advice they are receiving from adults and
factors shaping these adults' recommendations and perceptions of youth
plea processes. These factors may be complex and interrelated. For
example, as attorneys work with youth clients and parents, attorneys
likely shape youth thinking as well as how parents think about what is
best for their child. Parents, in turn, communicate their own
understanding and recommendations to their child. Attorney
recommendations may thus be driving parental plea recommendations to
their children, which implies that understanding how parents are
influenced is imperative to developing an accurate picture of the
juvenile plea process. Research aimed at improving our understanding of
adult influences on youth pleas must account for the reality that the
legal system does not exist in a racial vacuum, as race shapes every
aspect of the legal process (Haney-Caron & Fountain, Citation2021).
Therefore, to explore the ways in which parental and attorney
interactions may influence youth plea decisions, racial interactions
such as racial similarities and differences must also be assessed to
understand their bearing on this complex process. Including race in the
analysis is necessary to building a nuanced understanding of parental
perceptions of youth plea bargaining. This vignette-based study examines
parental recommendations to youth regarding plea decisions in juvenile
court, accounting for the influence of defense attorney advice and the
complex role of race in shaping legally based interactions.
Understanding these aspects of youth plea bargaining could provide
helpful information for how attorneys could approach discussion of the
plea bargain process with youth clients and their parents to increase
the likelihood that youth will make independent plea decisions.
Additionally, the results of this study provide initial information on
the impact of attorney race---and attorney/parent racial similarity---on
decisions to accept or discount attorney recommendations. Youth plea
decision factors [[Plea decisions must be made **knowingly**,
**intelligently**, and]{.mark} [**voluntarily** to be
Constitutionally]{.mark}]{.underline} [[valid]{.mark} and accepted by
the court]{.underline} (Boykin v. Alabama, Citation1969). However,
[[youth]{.mark} making [plea decisions may not have]{.mark}
all]{.underline} of [the]{.underline} pertinent
[[info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation [[they should have]{.mark}
amassed]{.underline} (i.e., [understanding the charges, the consequences
of the plea decision, and the rights they are waiving]{.underline}) [[in
order to make a]{.mark} knowing, intelligent, and voluntary
[decision]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Fountain & Woolard, Citation2017;
Viljoen & Roesch, Citation2005). Additionally,
[[youth]{.underline}]{.mark} are prone to risky and impulsive decisions
(Blakemore & Robbins, Citation2012; Chein et al., Citation2011), that
[[focus more on]{.mark} the [pressures]{.mark} felt [from]{.mark} others
like their [parents]{.mark} and attorneys]{.underline} (Viljoen et al.,
Citation2005), [and less on the actual future]{.underline} [implications
of accepting a plea bargain]{.underline}. Younger [youth]{.underline}
especially (ages 15 and under) are more likely to [acquiesce to the
suggestion of]{.underline} [authority figures]{.underline} (i.e.,
attorneys and parents; Grisso et al., Citation2003), which may be
because youth are primed to want to please authority figures and may
assume that an authority figure will point them in the right direction
(Riggs et al., 2010). Since youth are legally required to make their own
plea decisions (National Juvenile Defender Center (NJDC), Citation2012),
attorneys likely approach conversations with youth in a way that
attempts to ensure the youth's decision-making authority is not usurped,
while accounting for youths' developmentally limited reasoning abilities
(Henning, Citation2005). Specifically, because youth are especially
responsive to the opinions of authority figures, attorneys may be extra
careful when discussing plea options and opinions with youth clients in
an attempt to safeguard their right to an autonomous plea decision
(Henning, Citation2005). However, often attorneys choose to include
parents in the conversation to help ensure the plea is accepted by the
judge (Fountain & Woolard, Citation2021) [since plea offers can include
terms that impact [parents]{.mark}, as well]{.underline} (e.g.,
[[curfews, electronic monitoring, restitution fees, family
therapy]{.mark}). This could mean that [parental involvement leads to
plea negotiations skewing more toward parental interests instead]{.mark}
[of the best interests of the child]{.mark}, [especially if]{.mark} the
[collateral consequences]{.mark} of the plea [impact the]{.mark}
[family]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., [loss of public housing, sex
offender registration]{.underline}; Fountain & Woolard, Citation2021;
Pinard, Citation2005). It is important to understand how parents'
perceptions and opinions come into play in these interactions. As we
know, [youth rely on parental plea recommendations to make these
decisions]{.underline} (Viljoen et al., Citation2005), and since
attorneys commonly include parents in the plea discussion, we need to
understand the attorney-parent relationship (Fountain & Woolard,
Citation2021), to ensure parents do not overly rely on attorney
opinions. If parents are also heavily influenced by attorney
recommendations, and in turn influence their child, then even if an
attorney is careful to avoid overly influencing the child that same
influence may exert itself through the parent. Examining the degree to
which parents follow their child's attorney's advice is important to
informing attorney practices and may help attorneys better safeguard the
rights of young clients. Juvenile/Parent-Attorney relationships

\*NOTE: this is a rehighlighted version of the below Birnbaum and
Haney-Caron card to focus on parental involvement

Discussion This study assessed parental plea bargain recommendations
based on attorney advice and expands the literature to include how
attorney race may shape this juvenile plea bargain process. Contrary to
expectations, trust and perception of attorney alliance did not mediate
the relationship between racial similarity of the parent and attorney
and acquiescence to the attorney's advice. However, trust in the
attorney and perception of attorney alliance did mediate the
relationship between parent race and attorney acquiescence, but only
when the attorney was advising that the juvenile take the plea deal. It
seems that when the attorney encourages taking the plea deal, White
parents, who have a higher trust in the attorney and higher perceptions
of attorney alliance, were more likely to acquiesce to the attorney's
recommendation. White parents, with this high level of trust and the
feeling that the attorney is on their side, may believe that the
attorney would only be recommending them to take the plea deal because
he does not think they would win at trial. Going to trial is risky,
therefore if the attorney they trust believes it is too big of a risk,
the parents may think the odds of winning the trial are minuscule. The
finding that White parents overall were more likely to tell their child
to take the plea bargain, regardless of attorney race, contradicted our
initial hypotheses. Past research has been inconsistent with findings on
how adults plead in their own adjudicative cases with some research
pointing to Black people as being less likely to accept a plea offer,
due to the less favorable plea agreements they are likely to receive
(Frenzel & Ball, Citation2008; Subramanian et al., Citation2020), and
others finding no difference by race (Quickel & Zimmerman,
Citation2019). This finding adds support for the relationship between
race and plea bargaining being a complex one. Because this study was the
first to directly explore parental plea recommendations, we considered
that parents may advise their children in different ways than they
themselves would plead, as they would likely want their child to avoid
jail time at all costs. We expected that, as a result of the validated
cynicism of the legal system, Black parents would be more fearful of
advising their child to go to trial, as they might view their child as
being less likely to win. Contrary to these expectations, Black parents
were more likely to advise their child to go to trial regardless of
attorney race and attorney plea recommendation. Black parents have the
onerous responsibility of teaching their children how to survive in a
society built upon racist structures and institutions, while also
teaching them to thrive in this society through development of a
positive racial identity (Thomas & Speight, Citation1999). The Black
parents in this study may have seen the vignette scenario as a way to
racially socialize their children to the oppressive legal system.
Furthermore, since Black parents were more likely to advise their child
to go to trial, they may have been attempting to teach their child about
challenging the racism of the legal system, and not giving up their
rights without a fight. White people are, in general, more trusting in
the legal system due to a blindness of the privilege their race allots
them (Quickel & Zimmerman, Citation2019), whereas Black people tend to
be less trusting in the legal system due to awareness of the harsher
punishments they are more likely to receive (Smith & Hattery,
Citation2010). Thus, the finding that White parents overall viewed the
attorneys to be significantly more trustworthy than Black parents is
consistent with past research. Interestingly, Black attorneys were
viewed as more trustworthy than White attorneys no matter the attorney
recommendation. White attorneys may be seen as being part of "the
system" (King, Citation2008), while Black attorneys may be perceived as
trying to fight the system from within. White parents randomly assigned
to Black attorneys were more likely to follow advice when encouraged to
take the plea deal, but less likely to follow advice when urged to go to
trial, compared to other racial parent/attorney dyads. One possible
explanation for this finding could be that White parents may assume
Black attorneys to be more skeptical of the legal system, and therefore
assume a Black attorney would not be encouraging the parent to recommend
the plea deal, unless they knew that the deal was especially favorable.
Past research has shown [[parents]{.mark} often [believe]{.mark} that
[they have]{.mark} [the]{.mark} **[final say]{.mark}** on their child's
legal case [even if that opinion differs]{.mark} from the juvenile's
decisions]{.underline} (Fountain & Woolard, Citation2017). [This
perception can impact how youth make plea decisions if [the child holds
a]{.mark} similar [misunderstanding on who gets the last]{.mark}
[word]{.mark}, despite the youth]{.underline} ultimately [having the
legal right to make the decision and having to endure the consequences
of this decision]{.underline}. The results of this study found that
[while many of our participants believed they or other legal actors
(i.e., judge, attorney) made the final plea decision, a **small**
majority of participants declared they would allow their child to make
the decision]{.underline}. In accordance with the current literature
(Fountain & Woolard, Citation2017), [**[less than half]{.mark}** of [the
parent participants understood]{.mark} that legally [this
decision]{.mark} [is]{.mark} ultimately [up to the
child]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Parents]{.mark} with this assumption
[may]{.mark} end up [**pressuring** their child to make a plea
decision]{.mark} [the youth does not want]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[making]{.underline} [their plea decision
**involuntary**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore, this study provides
further support that [[parents]{.underline}
**[misinterpret]{.underline}** [their]{.underline}]{.mark}
[role]{.underline} in the juvenile plea bargain process. However,
[research has shown that [children's developmental immaturity]{.mark},
specifically their prefrontal cortex, which is [needed for higher level
functioning]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., decision making), [[leads to
**deficits**]{.mark} [in their adjudicative
competency]{.mark}]{.underline} (Viljoen & Roesch, Citation2005). [The
expectation of youth to make a plea decision in the absence of their
parents' advice is unrealistic and incongruent with developmental
literature]{.underline} (e.g., Daftary-Kapur & Zottoli, Citation2014;
Grisso et al., Citation2003). [Despite [parent]{.mark} assumptions that
the final decision is theirs to make, they do [have a **heavy**]{.mark}
[influence over their child]{.mark} during plea bargain
decision-making]{.underline}. Laws on juvenile plea bargaining should
reflect the limits of youths' cognitive capacities and consider
including parents or guardians in the pleading process. Presently legal
requirements fail to consider norms of collectivist cultures, including
Black American cultures, as it is customary to seek advice from family
members (Guess, Citation2004) and instead favor White cultural norms,
which are typically individualistic in nature. Revising laws to include
collectivist cultural norms could provide an alternative and superior
approach that would allow youth to account for their developmental
disadvantages. The questionnaire used in this study collected open-ended
responses in which participants explained their reasoning for their plea
recommendations. Many participants cited reasoning such as not wanting
their child to go to jail, trusting the attorney's recommendation, or
believing their child to be innocent and feeling that justice will
prevail. However, of note, several Black participants pointed out that
plea deals are commonly used as a way to coerce Black people into
falsely admitting guilt. These participants discuss the legal system
profiting off of these scare tactics, especially with Black youth, and
not wanting their child to become a victim of this racist structure.
These responses coupled with the finding that Black participants were
less likely to take the plea deal and trust their attorney's echo the
results found in Woolard et al. (Citation2008), in which Black
participants, especially young adults, had higher rates of cynicism
about the justice system, which correlated to being less likely to fully
disclose information to public defenders, and less likely to accept a
plea deal. Implications for attorney practice Parents, undeniably, play
a heavy role in their child's plea decision making, which is why it is
imperative to study their reasoning behind their plea recommendations.
Because both White and Black parents found Black attorneys to be more
trustworthy, White attorneys should work to rectify this gap in trust.
Earning their client's trust may be done with a variety of different
approaches; one possibility is that White attorneys should try to not
directly recommend a plea decision, but instead should discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of either taking or rejecting a plea offer.
Additionally, White attorneys should be candid when discussing the
racial disparities of the legal system, as the recognition can help earn
a Black client's trust (Henning, Citation2017). Acknowledging the racial
bias of the legal system not only with the client, but also as an
argument within the courtroom can help other legal actors account for
this prejudice in their own legal decision making and will, in turn,
increase the feeling of loyalty and alliance with Black clients
(Henning, Citation2017). Black parents tended not to trust attorneys in
general; thus, when an attorney has a Black juvenile client, they should
work rigorously to prove their alliance to their client by not
pressuring the plea decision and advocating for trial when the client is
innocent. Parents have been shown to have distorted perceptions of their
role in their child's plea decision (Fountain & Woolard, Citation2017),
which this study supported. It is essential for defense attorneys to
explain the legal requirements of a knowing and voluntary plea for a
youth's plea decision to both the youth and the parent, to avoid the
parent pressuring the child into a specific plea decision. Explaining to
the parent that their child can, but does not have to, consider the
parent's opinions can help resolve this misunderstanding. Supplementary
resources for parents, such as pamphlets explaining the plea process,
may help attorneys juggle their time restraints with their obligation to
their clients. Directions for future research

Race and the plea bargain process Scholarship and research on
juvenile-attorney relationships have largely failed to address the
impact of race. The legal system's racial disparities are substantial,
as [[youth of color]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [**disproportionately**
involved]{.mark} in the legal system at **every** stage]{.underline}
(Haney-Caron & Fountain, Citation2021); for example, [**[52%]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the [youth]{.mark} [arrested]{.mark} for violent juvenile
crime in 2016 [were Black]{.mark}]{.underline} (U.S. Department of
Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation \[FBI\], 2016), even [though
the Black community only makes up about **13%** of the United States
population]{.underline} (U.S. Census Bureau, Citation2017). However,
[although legally involved youth are often youth of color, their
[defense attorneys are]{.mark} **overwhelmingly** likely to be
[White]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, one study of juvenile defense
attorneys reported that [**78%** of attorney participants]{.underline}
[were White]{.underline} (Fountain & Woolard, Citation2018).
Additionally, in a self-report study [using 163 juveniles in
correctional facilities, **70%** of the youth were Black, but they
reported that **90%** of the attorneys]{.underline} [representing them
were White]{.underline} (Pierce & Brodsky, Citation2002), which further
exemplifies the racial disparity. The limited research available
suggests a complex impact of race on attorney relationships with their
clients and their parents. In one study on juvenile trust of defense
attorneys, [when White defendants were less knowledgeable, they showed a
larger distrust of their attorneys, whereas [when Black defendants were
more knowledgeable, they showed a larger distrust in]{.mark} [their
attorneys]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pierce & Brodsky, Citation2002). This
could be attributed to the stigma of the legal system and its overt
racial disparities. Since Black people are more likely to be profiled by
law enforcement and receive harsher punishments (Kovera, Citation2019),
[Black individuals with more knowledge of the legal system would be
right to exercise caution with regard to legal actors]{.underline}.
[White individuals also tend to be blind to the privilege they receive
in the legal system and are more likely to think that the system is
"working" due to said blindness]{.underline} (Quickel & Zimmerman,
Citation2019). Race may also more directly impact youths' experiences of
the plea bargain process, thus impacting parents as they help navigate
the system with their child. Research in one jurisdiction illustrated
that [[Black juveniles were less likely to be offered a]{.mark} [plea
bargain]{.mark} in general]{.underline}; [this inequity is even more
pronounced when coupled with being a female and committing a violent
crime, compared to their white female counterparts]{.underline} (Lowery,
Citation2019). [[Since these youth]{.mark} [are less likely to receive
plea deals]{.mark}, [they have]{.mark} higher instances of being
[transfer]{.mark}red [to adult court]{.mark}, [as well as being
subjected to detention facilities and confinement]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Burrow & Lowery, Citation2015; Cheesman et al., Citation2010). Although
the impact of juvenile race on the plea-bargaining process has been
studied, literature on the impact of attorney race or the interaction
between attorney and parent race on juvenile plea decisions has not been
examined yet. Research thus far has focused mainly on the racial impact
on adult plea-bargaining decisions, however, this too has not been
widely studied. Nonetheless, scholarly literature on racial impact on
adult plea-bargaining decisions can provide an initial framework to
understand how parents would navigate this system if they were the
defendant, which can help better determine what factors they would
consider. First, pretrial discrimination may impact the plea bargain
process in general due to the differences in multiple factors that lead
to individuals ending up in the legal system (Johnson & Richardson,
Citation2019). For instance, [the decisions to arrest an individual
could shape the pool of applicants for a plea bargain, because those
disparities in arrest will lead to disparities in cases referred to
prosecutors]{.underline}. There are certain variables that influence
plea making decisions for adults that appear to differ by race, as well.
For instance, [being represented by court-appointed counsel and presence
of physical evidence are associated with a greater likelihood of
pleading guilty for Black defendants]{.underline} (Albonetti,
Citation1990), and [an extensive criminal record and the severity of the
offense were associated with a lesser likelihood of pleading guilty for
Black defendants]{.underline} (Metcalfe & Chiricos, Citation2018).
Overall, limited available research suggests that [[Black defendants may
be less likely than White defendants to plead
guilty]{.underline}]{.mark} (Albonetti, Citation1990; Frenzel & Ball,
Citation2008; Metcalfe & Chiricos, Citation2018), although a
vignette-based study of adult plea decisions reported that the decision
to plead did not significantly differ by race (Quickel & Zimmerman,
Citation2019). With this literature in mind, it is crucial to determine
if adult plea recommendations to their children mirror adult plea
decisions about their own pleas, or if they would consider different
factors when making recommendations to their child. Current study

were **incredibly**]{.mark} **[quick]{.mark}**, **consistent** with
observational studies spanning up to **four decades**]{.underline}
(e.g., Miller et al., 1978; Sanborn, 1992). [The [hearings]{.mark}
[lasted]{.mark} about 6 to **[8 min]{.mark}** [in juvenile court]{.mark}
and about twice as long, but still only 13 min, in criminal
court]{.underline}. Although the plea hearings we observed were longer
than misdemeanor arraignment hearings (about 3 min; Smith & Maddan,
2011), [is it possible that plea validity can be adequately---much less
comprehensively---addressed in a **matter of minutes**]{.underline}? As
a result, [even [juveniles]{.mark}, [who]{.mark} [**regularly** **fail**
to]{.mark} fully understand many aspects of [their legal
case]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Grisso et al., 2003; Zottoli et al., in
press), [**[ceded their rights]{.mark}** and were convicted, often of
**felony** crimes, [in]{.mark} **[mere minutes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In contrast, [[the length of a]{.mark} criminal jury [trial is **11
h**r]{.mark} and 7 min]{.underline} (or 667 min; Sipes et al., 1988).
Thus, [the time it takes to convict a juvenile by trial is roughly **[95
times]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[longer than]{.mark} the time it takes to
convict them [by plea]{.mark}, and 51 times longer for an
adult.]{.underline} [[Hearing length could be]{.mark} construed as [a
**proxy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of
other facets of the hearing, including [[defendant engagement]{.mark},
[plea validity review]{.mark}, [or discussion of evidence and/or
charges]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [hearing length was positively
correlated with defendant participation and review of
details]{.underline} [of]{.underline} all three of the
[plea]{.underline} [validity]{.underline} components, an important
finding given that such a review is a core purpose of the hearing
itself. However, a closer examination revealed that this latter pattern
held only in the Virginia criminal court, suggesting that, for the
juveniles, longer hearings did not result in more detailed discussion of
the plea, its meaning, or its implications for the juveniles. Those
discussions in criminal court, as well, may have contributed to the plea
hearings' generally longer length in criminal relative to juvenile
court. In juvenile court, it is possible that judges focus on tangential
but related elements to the plea, such as parental/guardian
understanding and acceptance of the plea conditions (see Fountain &
Woolard, 2021) or the juveniles' prior criminal history, which may
affect their current charges and sentence. As found by Rodriguez (2010),
detained youth are more likely to have prior charges than those not
detained; at the Virginia juvenile court, we found that plea hearings
were longer for defendants in custody than those not in custody, though
this pattern did not emerge at the California juvenile or Virginia
criminal courts. Other hearing characteristics that differed between
courts may also have contributed to variations in length and, more
importantly, to defendants' likely understanding of their case, the
plea, and its consequences. [[Evidence was
reviewed]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, in the overwhelming
majority of criminal cases but **[quite [rarely]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[in juvenile courts]{.underline}. To our knowledge, [a proffer (or
presentation) of evidence is **not a required** part of plea
hearings]{.underline}. The American Bar Association's (1999) Criminal
Justice Standards for plea discussions and agreements does not mention
reviews of evidence in its listed responsibilities for judges,
prosecutors, and defenders. Yet [research has **consistently**
demonstrated that stronger evidence increases the likelihood that
individuals, including adolescents, will accept a plea]{.underline}
(Peterson-Badali & Abramovitch, 1993; Redlich et al., 2016; Viljoen et
al., 2005). And while we do not know whether defense attorneys reviewed
evidence with juveniles before the hearings, [a lack of review by judges
is a **striking omission** given the value that knowledge of the
evidence may play and given that judges in criminal court regularly
provide such a review.]{.underline} Likewise, in both the Virginia
criminal court and the California juvenile court, most
[[defendants]{.mark} [heard]{.mark} the [charges]{.mark} read at the
start]{.underline}, whereas [in the Virginia juvenile
court]{.underline}, this occurred in [**[only]{.underline}**
**[6%]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to 19%]{.underline} [[of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [[cases]{.underline}]{.mark}, depending on the severity
of offenses to which the juvenile pleaded. Even if defense attorneys
explained the charges to Virginia juvenile before the hearing, [a
re-review by the judge would serve only to enhance juveniles'
understanding, an especially crucial need given [**consistent**
findings]{.mark} that [highlight]{.mark} **significant [gaps]{.mark}**
[in minor defendants' knowledge]{.mark} [of]{.mark} legal proceedings,
including [the plea]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Grisso et al., 2003;
Redlich et al., 2019; Zottoli & Daftary-Kapur, 2019). [[Without]{.mark}
substantial [explanation]{.mark}, [it is **unlikely**]{.mark} that
[juveniles]{.mark} fully [understand the process]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
the [consequences]{.mark} of the plea, a view shared by some courtroom
actors]{.underline} (Sanborn, 1992; Woestehoff et al., 2019).

#### Threat of adult court is also coercive and harm black and brown adolescents

**Orleans 23** \[Rebecca Orleans, Public defender at Brooklyn Defender
Services, 2023, "Exposing The Backroom Shakedown: The Weaponization Of
Adult Prosecution In Juvenile Court Plea Negotiations," NYU Review of
Law & Social Change,

ABSTRACT During the 1980s and 1990s, fear of a juvenile crime wave
spurned legislation that expanded the reach of adult criminal court. An
"adult time for adult crime" ideology took hold, and between 1992 and
1997, **[44 states]{.underline}** and the District of Columbia enacted
or [expanded provisions to transfer children to adult
courts.]{.underline} Although in the past two decades courts and state
legislatures have exhibited a deeper understanding of the neurological
differences between children and adults, [[most]{.mark}
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[retained the ability]{.mark} to
criminally prosecute children under 18 if they are charged with certain
crimes.]{.underline} As a result, [[prosecutors]{.underline}]{.mark} can
often [[use the **threat**]{.mark} [of adult criminal charges as a
**bargaining chip**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against children [in]{.mark}
juvenile]{.underline} [court [plea negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} practice **[drastically]{.underline}**
[raises the stakes in a process]{.underline} that [adolescents are
developmentally ill-equipped to]{.underline} [handle]{.underline}. In
this article I consider how juvenile defenders might mount an
[attack]{.underline} against [prosecutors who wield the threat of adult
prosecution against children in juvenile court]{.underline}. I argue
that [the practice of [threatening children]{.mark} with adult
prosecution is likely to disproportionately [harm Black and Latinx
youth]{.mark}]{.underline}, [who are [routinely seen as older, more
dangerous, and more responsible]{.mark} for their actions [than]{.mark}
their [white peers]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Additionally, I review
findings that [[adolescents **struggle**]{.mark} [to make risk-reward
calculations]{.mark} in situations characterized by high emotion or
stimulation]{.underline}, thereby indicating that [[adolescents are at
a]{.mark} distinct [disadvantage]{.mark} in the plea bargaining
process]{.underline}. I discuss promising [Supreme Court
decisions]{.underline} rooted in adolescent neuroscience that limited
the most extreme sentences for youth--- capital punishment and juvenile
life without parole in non-homicide offenses--- after
[recognizing]{.underline} that [children are fundamentally different
from adults]{.underline}. These decisions provide [a strong basis for
bringing **prosecutorial vindictiveness** claims]{.underline} against
prosecutors who wield the threat of adult charges against children in
juvenile court. Although the Supreme Court in its newest composition has
not explicitly overruled these decisions, its most recent decision on
youth sentencing, Jones v. Mississippi, seriously undermined them. Jones
poses a grave danger to children in the adult criminal legal system,
making it all the more important to keep them out of it. INTRODUCTION D,
a 15-year-old Black boy, allegedly took a pack of cigarettes from an
unlocked car in 2019. The state of Louisiana charged him with simple
burglary and placed him in juvenile detention. When I met him during the
summer of 2020, he was still locked up on this charge. At the time I was
working as a legal intern at a children's defense office in Louisiana,
and I assisted with D's representation. When D was initially arrested,
he appeared before a juvenile court judge who placed him in juvenile
detention. However, the judge failed to conduct a continued custody
hearing within three days of D's entry. This failure violated Article
819 of the Louisiana Children's Code. Accordingly, D was entitled to
release pursuant to the article, which states If a child is not released
to the care of his parents, the court shall set and hold a hearing
within three days after the child's entry into the juvenile detention
center or shelter care facility . . . . If the hearing is not held, the
child shall be released.1F 1 When D's attorney explained to the
prosecutor that she was going to move for his release on these grounds,
the prosecutor made a threat. He said that if D's attorney petitioned
for D's release, he would use another charge that D was facing in a
separate case to transfer D to adult court. Unrelated to the simple
burglary, D had been charged with aggravated battery. While aggravated
battery is not a transferrable offense under the Louisiana Children's
Code, attempted murder is.2F 2 The prosecutor said that if D's attorney
moved for his release on the stolen cigarettes case, he would increase
D's aggravated battery charge to an attempted murder charge and then
transfer that case to adult court. As D's mother remarked, [the
prosecutor was **playing dirty**. [A conviction in criminal court
commonly entails a longer sentence, a public criminal record]{.mark} and
its associated [collateral]{.mark} [consequences]{.mark}, [and
incarceration in adult prison]{.mark}, [where]{.mark} the chance of
[violence against youth is]{.mark} [high]{.mark}]{.underline}.3F 3
[[Transfer to adult court is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore
[[so]{.underline} **[consequential]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [our
client---and most [young]{.mark} [people]{.mark}---would [go to
**great** **lengths** to avoid it]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the face of
this threat, D and his attorney decided against moving for his release.
Therefore, as COVID-19 was wreaking havoc in prisons and jails across
the country, D remained locked up when he was entitled to release. [[D's
experience is an example of the **weaponization** of adult
transfer]{.mark} in juvenile proceedings]{.underline}, [[which goes
**virtually unchecked**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A wealth of transfer
provisions enacted during the 1990's "Tough on Crime" era grants
prosecutors enormous discretion in transfer decisions, leaving them the
power to transfer kids to adult court with almost no oversight.4F 4
[Prosecutors can and do use the threat of adult prosecution as a
bargaining chip]{.underline}. Typically, [[plea negotiations take place
under a **time crunch**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [demand a weighing of
immediate reward against remote risk, and require trust between
adolescents and their attorneys---issues the adolescent brain is
developmentally ill-equipped to handle]{.underline}.5F 5 [Combined with
the threat of adult prosecution]{.underline}, the [[plea
bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark} process [[becomes downright
**coercive**]{.underline}]{.mark}.6F 6 Furthermore, evidence concerning
racial disparities at all stages of the juvenile legal system indicates
that [prosecutors wield the threat of adult prosecution
disproportionately against children of color]{.underline}.7F 7 When I
explained D's situation and the prosecutor's threat to a friend, she
raised a question that I ask almost daily: How on earth are
they---prosecutors--- allowed to do that? D had a statutory right to his
release. How was a prosecutor permitted to pressure him into
relinquishing that right? In Blackledge v. Perry, the Supreme Court held
that malicious or bad faith increases in punishment threatened by
prosecutors constituted "vindictiveness,"8F 8 and that "[the [fear
of]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[vindictiveness may]{.mark}
[**unconstitutionally** deter a defendant's exercise" of their due
process rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.9F 9 Perry concerned a writ of
habeas corpus. Mr. Perry had been convicted of a misdemeanor, which
carried a six-month sentence. He had then filed an appeal. In response,
the prosecutor brought felony charges against Perry for the same
incident, "subjecting him to a significantly increased potential period
of incarceration."10F 10 In the face of these new charges, Perry
withdrew his appeal and pled to a five-to-seven-year sentence. The Court
held that the prosecutor's potentially vindictive behavior violated
Perry's due process rights.11F 11 Therefore, the Court affirmed habeas
relief. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court gutted its own vindictiveness
doctrine just four years later in Bordenkircher v. Hayes.12F 12 In that
case, Hayes challenged a charge brought against him under the Habitual
Criminal Act, which carried a mandatory life sentence.13F 13 The
prosecutor had only filed this charge after Hayes refused to take a plea
offer on a lesser charge. In his brief for the Court, Hayes argued that
this practice constituted prosecutorial vindictiveness: [The potential
for impermissible vindictiveness exists when a prosecutor is allowed to
bring an enhanced indictment against a defendant who has refused to
plead guilty to the unenhanced charge in exchange for the State's offer
of leniency]{.underline}. [Due process was offended by placing Mr. Hayes
in fear of retaliatory action for insisting upon his right to plead
not]{.underline} [guilty]{.underline}. Consequently, Mr. Hayes'
conviction as an habitual offender must be vacated because it is the
product of the prosecutor's constitutionally impermissible retaliatory
act.14F 14 The Bordenkircher Court disagreed. According to the Court,
the prosecutor had not exhibited vindictiveness---he had simply
bargained.15F 15 This ruling presents a significant obstacle to D or
people like him who might hope to bring a vindictiveness claim. However,
I argue that Supreme Court decisions rooted in adolescent brain science
have created an avenue for challenging Bordenkircher's applicability in
juvenile proceedings. Lawyers can draw on the Supreme Court's holdings
in Roper v. Simmons,16F 16 Graham v. Florida,17F 17 Miller v.
Alabama,18F 18 and J.D.B. v. North Carolina,19F 19 to undermine
Bordenkircher's applicability in juvenile court. These cases recognize
that "children are different"20F 20 and require courts to take into
account the mitigating factors of youth in sentencing decisions and
analyses of Miranda warnings.21F 21 Recently, however, in Jones v.
Mississippi, the newly comprised Supreme Court claimed to uphold these
cases while simultaneously subjecting adolescents in the criminal legal
system to harsher punishment.22F 22 The 2021 decision, authored by
Justice Brett Kavanaugh for a 6-3 majority, has been characterized as
"one of the most dishonest and cynical decisions in recent memory."23F
23 Writing for the dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that "the
Court is fooling no one" in its claim that the decision adhered to
precedent.24F 24 Personally, I find it maddening when the Supreme Court
proclaims to uphold precedent while simultaneously undermining it. In
this case, however, the practice has a silver lining: the Court's
insistence that it has not departed from precedent leaves open the
pathway for defenders to mount an attack against Bordenkircher in
juvenile court. Part I of this paper will outline the history of the
juvenile court and explain how the boundary between juvenile and
criminal courts has blurred over time. Part II will describe how an
influx of transfer provisions during the Tough on Crime era shifted the
power to transfer from judges to prosecutors. Prosecutors took on the
role of gatekeeper to the juvenile system and accordingly possess
inordinate power in the plea bargaining process. Part III will explain
how adolescents are at a developmental disadvantage in the plea
bargaining process. This Part also discusses the likelihood that adult
prosecution is weaponized disproportionately against children of color.
Finally, Part IV addresses how to stop prosecutors from using the threat
of adult court to bolster their power in juvenile court. This Part
proposes that a prosecutorial vindictiveness claim, rendered mostly
defunct by Bordenkircher v. Hayes, can prevail in circumstances in which
prosecutors weaponize transfer in plea bargaining proceedings. Although
the Supreme Court in its current composition has demonstrated its
unwillingness to expand protections for adolescent offenders,25F 25 some
state courts have proven susceptible to creative arguments.26F 26 It is
critical for defenders to use every tool at our disposal to thwart
prosecutors' attempts to use adult prosecution as a bargaining chip in
juvenile court. I. THE HISTORY OF JUVENILE COURT

#### Stats prove high false guilty plea rates for minors -- police interrogation and developing brains

International University, Elizabeth P. Shulman, researcher at University
of Pennsylvania and Temple University, and Elizabeth Cauffman,

In the present study, we examined (a) the prevalence and characteristics
of youths' true and false admissions (confessions and guilty pleas), (b)
youths' interrogation experiences with police and lawyers, and (c)
whether youths' interrogation experiences serve as situational risk
factors for true and false admissions. [[We interviewed **193**]{.mark}
14- to 17-year-old males]{.underline} (M 16.4) incarcerated for serious
crimes. [Over 1/3 of the sample (35.2%) claimed to have made a false
admission to legal authorities]{.underline} (17.1% false confession;
**[[18.1% false guilty plea]{.underline}]{.mark}**), and 2/3 claimed to
have made a true admission (28.5% true confession; 37.3% true guilty
plea). [The majority of youth said that they had experienced
high-pressure interrogations (e.g., **threats**]{.underline}),
especially with police officers. Youth who mentioned experiencing
"police refusals" (e.g., of a break to rest) were more likely to report
having made both true and false confessions to police, whereas only
false confessions were associated with claims of long interrogations (2
hr) and being questioned in the presence of a friend. The number of
self-reported high-pressure lawyer tactics was associated with false,
but not true, guilty pleas. Results suggest the importance of conducting
specialized trainings for those who interrogate youth, recording
interrogations, placing limits on lengthy and manipulative techniques,
and exploring alternative procedures for questioning juvenile suspects.
At the age of 13 years, Tyler Edmonds of Oktibbeha County, Mississippi,
made a shocking confession to police--- he had shot and killed his
sister's husband. Later, Tyler claimed to have falsely confessed to
protect his 26-year-old sister. Tyler was tried as an adult and
sentenced to life in prison. Four years later, the Missis- sippi Supreme
Court overturned his conviction (Edmonds v. State of Mississippi, 2007),
and Tyler was acquitted in a subsequent retrial. This high-profile
example of [an innocent juvenile defen- dant confessing to a crime is
not an isolated incident]{.underline}. It is impos- sible to pinpoint
precisely how often false confessions occur; however, [proven cases from
juveniles and adults have been doc- umented around the
world]{.underline} (Kassin et al., 2010). In addition, [there are
many]{.underline} [known]{.underline} [cases of juvenile and adult
defendants opting to plead guilty to crimes they have not
committed]{.underline} (see Redlich, 2010a, for a review), typically [to
avoid facing a harsher penalty if convicted at trial]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} approximately **[25%]{.underline}** [of the Innocence
Project's]{.underline} (n.d.) [DNA exonerations]{.underline} in the
United States (n 305), [a false admission of guilt contributed to the
wrongful conviction]{.underline}. Admissions of guilt are powerful.
People are so predisposed to believe confessions that their existence
tends to interfere with potential jurors' and investigators' evaluation
of other relevant evidence (e.g., eyewitness identifications, forensic
science; Hasel & Kassin, 2009; Kassin, Bogart, & Kerner, 2012). [When
individ- uals decide to plead guilty, they forego the right to a jury
trial and several other legal protections]{.underline} (e.g., the right
to confront and cross-examine witnesses; Redlich, 2010a). Thus, the
question of whether admissions of guilt (confessions and guilty pleas)
are diagnostic of actual guilt is critical. Over the last two decades,
research on false confessions has mushroomed (see Kassin et al., 2010;
Lassiter & Meissner, 2010; Leo, 2008, for reviews). As [police
interrogations have moved toward psychological manipulation]{.underline}
rather than exertion of brute force (Thomas & Leo, 2012), researchers
have tried to elucidate the aspects of interrogations (i.e., situational
risk factors) that may induce false confessions. Despite a growing
interest in the topic, especially concerning adolescents and other
vulnerable popula- tions (e.g., persons with mental illness; Redlich,
2004), very little is known about the prevalence or characteristics of
false confes- sions among juveniles or the interrogation techniques to
which young suspects are subjected. Furthermore, although most criminal
convictions (over 90%) are determined via guilty plea rather than trial
(Cohen & Reaves, 2006), research on false guilty pleas has lagged behind
research on false confessions (Redlich, 2010a). Moreover, virtually
nothing is known about juveniles' decisions to admit guilt truthfully.
To increase the potential for distinguishing true from false admissions,
it is imperative to examine true admis- sions as well. The Importance of
Examining Interrogations, Confessions, and Guilty Pleas Among Youth
Adolescents, [[due to]{.mark} their relative [immaturity]{.mark}, [may
be]{.mark} more [prone]{.mark} than adults [to make]{.mark}]{.underline}
both true and [[false admissions of guilt]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed,
[[proven]{.underline} [exoneration]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[cases]{.underline}]{.mark} (Drizin & Leo, 2004; Gross, Jacoby,
Matheson, Montgomery, & Patil, 2005), [[self-report
studies]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gudjonsson, Sigurdsson, Sigfusdottir, &
Young, 2012), [[labora- tory paradigms]{.underline}]{.mark} (Redlich &
Goodman, 2003), [[and hypothetical vignettes]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Goldstein, Condie, Kalbeitzer, Osman, & Geier, 2003)
[[demonstrate]{.mark} that [youth are]{.mark} **[particularly
vulnerable]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} providing [false]{.mark}
[confessions]{.mark}]{.underline} compared with adults. Of youth who
have been interrogated by the police, the [self-reported [rates
of]{.mark} false confes- sion vary from 0% to
**[13.8%]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Gudjonsson, Sigurdsson, As-
geirsdottir, & Sigfusdottir, 2006; Sigurdsson & Gudjonsson, 1996). The
desire to protect a peer and attempts to avoid punish- ment or custodial
pressure are common motivations for false confession (see Gudjonsson,
2010). All but one (Viljoen, Klaver, & Roesch, 2005) of these
self-report studies were conducted in Europe, however. Given the
distinctiveness of U.S. interrogation practices (see Gudjonsson &
Pearse, 2011), these prior findings may not generalize to U.S.
populations. [[Developmental characteristics such as impulsivity,
susceptibil- ity to social influence, lower status relative to adults,
and immature judgment may explain]{.mark} the greater propensity of
adolescents to admit to offenses of which they are accused, especially
if psycho- logically manipulative and high-pressure techniques are
used]{.underline} (Cauffman & Steinberg, 2000; see Owen-Kostelnik,
Reppucci, & Meyer, 2006, for a review). Compared with adults,
[adolescents are more sensitive to immediate rewards and less sensitive
to long- term negative consequences]{.underline} (Cauffman et al., 2010;
Steinberg et al., 2009). In the context of an interrogation, this may
mean that [adolescents are excessively swayed by implications of lenient
treatment for confessing and insufficiently attentive to the long range
implications of confessing]{.underline} (e.g., a greater certainty of
con- viction). Furthermore, adolescents tend to be highly susceptible to
peer influence, placing great importance on peer relationships (e.g.,
Gardner & Steinberg, 2005). The desire to protect a peer may therefore
be especially powerful for adolescents (e.g., Warr, 1993). In addition,
[adolescents tend to be more compliant with authority
figures]{.underline} than adults (e.g., Grisso et al., 2003), as
acknowledged in a Supreme Court decision, which noted that "\[a\]
reasonable child subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel
pressured to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go"
(J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 2011, p. 8). Furthermore, [juveniles exhibit
less legal competence than adults]{.underline}:
[[They]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[fail to]{.mark} fully
[understand]{.mark} [their legal rights]{.mark}, frequently
[waive]{.mark} their [Miranda rights, and **rarely** request an
attorney]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Feld, 2013; Grisso et al., 2003;
Viljoen et al., 2005). Consequently, [juveniles' legal decisions,
including those related to admissions of guilt, may reflect poor legal
abilities/ understanding, inappropriate reasoning]{.underline} (e.g.,
failure to consider the strength of the evidence against them), [and/or
developmental immaturity]{.underline}. The contexts in which youth
decide to plead guilty may share many similarities with police
interrogation contexts, including demands to make an immediate decision
(e.g., one-time offer plea deals) and pressure from adult authority
figures (e.g., lawyers; Drizin & Luloff, 2007; Redlich, 2010a). Thus,
the same develop- mental characteristics that put youth at heightened
risk for false confession may also influence their tendency to make a
false guilty plea. However, the alternative is also possible: Juveniles
may be unlikely to falsely plead guilty because their risk proneness
drives them to take their chances at trial (Redlich, 2010b). False
Admissions of Guilt The role of developmental immaturity in admission of
guilt may be amplified in the United States, due to the use of
high-pressure interrogation techniques (Kassin et al., 2010;
Owen-Kostelnik et al., 2006) and the threat of increasingly punitive
sentences for juveniles (Fagan, 2008). Generally, [American
[interrogations are guilt presumptive, accusatorial, and]{.mark}
[confrontational]{.mark}]{.underline}, with officers frequently
employing the Reid technique (Inbau, Reid, Buckley, & Jayne, 2013; Leo,
2008). Various techniques are used to induce confession, including
maximization [[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[involve **intim-
idation**]{.mark} tactics, such as accusing the suspect and presenting
actual or fabricated evidence of guilt. Interrogators may also use mini-
mization strategies in which police feign empathy with suspects and
provide face-saving justifications for committing crime]{.underline}
(e.g., armed robbery to provide food for loved ones). Both maximization
and minimization are designed to make suspects feel that their best
option is to confess (Ofshe & Leo, 1997). [U.S. police are generally
allowed and trained to question juve- niles in the same manner as
adults]{.underline} (Inbau et al., 2013). The limited research evidence
available suggests that they do: In a national survey (Reppucci, Meyer,
& Kostelnik, 2010), [substantial propor- tions of police officers who
had interrogated in the last year reported using maximization
techniques, such as the [presentation of false]{.mark} [evidence]{.mark}
(**[23%]{.mark}**), [deceit]{.mark} (**[32%]{.mark}**), [and repeated
questioning]{.mark} (**58%**),]{.underline} among other Reid-like
techniques. Feld (2006) examined 66 recorded interrogations with 16- to
17-year-old suspects and found many similarities with Leo's (1996)
observational study of interrogations with adult suspects (e.g., 34%
maximized the seri- ousness of the crime, 38% offered to help).
Analyzing felony interrogations with juveniles in Minnesota, Feld (2013)
found that [police commonly used maximization tactics (69.1%), including
confronting juveniles with evidence (54%), emphasizing the seri- ousness
of the crime (14%), and accusing them of lying (33%]{.underline}).
Furthermore, not only is it legal for youths to be questioned in the
same manner as adults---[some]{.underline} of the Reid
[technique's]{.underline} interroga- tion themes [are]{.underline}
specifically [**[designed]{.underline}** [to **exploit** youths'
develop- mental vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
[police may suggest to a ju- venile suspect that his or her lack of
parental supervision or temptation to abuse substances justifies the
commission of the crime]{.underline} (Inbau et al., 2013). However,
[[surveys]{.underline}]{.mark} of law enforcement and recorded
interrogations may [**[underestimate]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [full [extent of high-pressure
interrogation]{.mark} [of young suspects]{.mark}:]{.underline} [[Police
may **under- report**]{.mark} their use of particularly [**coercive**
strategies]{.mark} and/[or]{.mark} [use less extreme forms]{.mark} of
them [while under observation]{.mark} than in private]{.underline}.
Notably, we also have limited knowledge concerning how youths'
interrogation experiences influence their confession and plea decisions.
In laboratory studies and actual cases, evidence strongly suggests that
certain techniques (e.g., lengthy interroga- tions, deceit/trickery)
increase the incidence of false confession (e.g., Drizin & Leo, 2004;
Redlich & Goodman, 2003; Russano, Meissner, Narchet, & Kassin, 2005).
However, extant research is limited, in that it draws largely on cases
of proven false confes- sions (e.g., DNA exonerees), which may not be
representative of all criminal/delinquency cases (Redlich, Kulish, &
Steadman, 2011). Less is known about false guilty pleas and their
situational risk factors. Redlich (2010a) cogently describes the
similarities and differences between false confessions and false guilty
pleas. For example, to induce confession, police may use minimization to
imply leniency, but are prohibited from promising it. In contrast, when
reaching a plea agreement, explicit promises of leniency are allowed;
plea agreements typically involve a decision to accept a lesser sentence
than what is at stake if convicted at trial. (In laboratory studies,
both implications and promises of leniency increase the rate of false
confession \[Kassin & McNall, 1991; Russano et al., 2005\]). Redlich,
Summers, and Hoover (2010) investigated false guilty pleas and false
confessions among adult offenders with mental illness: The overall rate
of false guilty plea (36.5%) was higher than the rate of false
confession (22%). Both types of guilt admission were commonly made to
end questioning, avoid jail, or go home, suggesting that similar
psychological processes may operate in the decision to submit false
confessions and false guilty pleas. Whether the same pattern holds for
juve- niles---another group overrepresented among proven false confes-
sion cases---remains unknown. True Admissions of Guilt

INTRODUCTION [[**Countless** young adults are subjected to sexual abuse
in juvenile correctional]{.mark} [facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. 1
"Ebony V." describes her harrowing sexual abuse by a staff member:
"\[During the day\] he'd come pick me up from the lunchroom . . . he
took me back to the unit and had sex with me . . . \[At night,\] most of
the time we went to the schoolhouse right next door to the unit or we
went to his office." 2 Unfortunately, Ebony V. is not alone in her
experience. 3 The San Mateo County, California juvenile justice system
became a hunting ground for a child psychiatrist, Dr. William Ayres.4
[[One victim]{.mark} [described being]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[raped]{.underline}]{.mark} by Ayres [[at]{.mark} the [age]{.mark} of
[twelve]{.mark} at least seven to **[ten times]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 5
[Another victim reflected on the impact of Ayers' sexual abuse and how
the victim "fell into a cycle of turning \[his\] pain into anger and
**hurting others**]{.underline}." 6 [Society views prison rape and
sexual abuse of juveniles as an innate part of prison life]{.underline}.
7 Unfortunately, the [sexual [maltreatment]{.mark}]{.underline}
committed by individuals who are in supervisory roles [[contributes
to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} improper [**normalization** of sexual
abuse]{.mark} [of]{.mark} adolescent [children]{.mark} in
prison]{.underline}.8 Recent reports indicate the tragic truth about
rape and sexual abuse by prison workers. 9 The National Survey of Youth
in Custody by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics ("BJS") found
that [[between 2007 and 2012,]{.mark} the rate of [formal sex abuse
allegations against staff]{.mark}]{.underline} in state juvenile justice
facilities **[[doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [even as the number of
children entering those systems dropped]{.underline}.10 The study also
indicated that, among the young adolescents and children who were
victims of staff sexual misconduct, roughly **[[six of]{.mark} every
[seven]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[reported multiple incidents and **one
in** ]{.mark}**every [five]{.mark}** [reported eleven or more]{.mark}
incidents]{.underline}. 11 Juveniles are developmentally different from
adults and, as such, they require heightened specialized care and
treatment by well-trained staff.12 Atkins v. Virginia was foundational
in recognizing juvenile's rights when it held that juveniles have
diminished mental capacities and are in need of additional
protections.13 Juveniles' physical and mental vulnerabilities increase
the need for stronger protections in correctional facilities. 14 Despite
laws like the Prison Rape Elimination Act ("PREA"), which protects
prisoners against sexual abuse, the number of sexual assaults in
correctional facilities continues to rise, especially in juvenile
populations.15 This Comment argues that states are failing to adhere to
PREA in juvenile correctional facilities, resulting in a violation of
individuals' Eighth Amendment constitutional right to be protected from
cruel and unusual punishment. 16 Part II discusses PREA and summarizes
the basic principles of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. 17 Part III
argues that states' protections of juveniles in correctional facilities
are insufficient, violate the Eighth Amendment, and do not follow PREA
standards.18 Part IV recommends that states should implement policies
that eradicate staff-on-inmate sexual abuse and create juvenile-specific
oversight committees. 19 Part V concludes by reiterating that states'
failure to follow PREA standards is a violation of juveniles' Eight
Amendment right.20 I. BACKGROUND

When states do not hold facilities accountable, it allows detention
officers to ignore jail standards and enter into juvenile female
inmates' cells unannounced, increasing the opportunity to sexually
assault youth, which is both inexcusable and unlawful.130 According to
the Oklahoma Jail Standards, any cell entry of a juvenile female
requires two detention officers and one of them must be female. 131
Oklahoma implemented this law to properly safeguard juveniles from
sexual assault as required under PREA.132 PREA standards also require
that supervising officers properly oversee detention facilities.133 It
is unlawful for an active supervisor of a juvenile detention facility to
fail to fulfill his duty of ensuring the safety of a juvenile inmate.
134 Sheriff Stanley Glanz blatantly ignored Oklahoma Jail Standards and
PREA.135 Sheriff Glanz's inefficiency was demonstrated through his
inaction after a reported incident in 2008, which involved a male nurse
watching a fifteen-year-old female inmate showering.136 Appropriate
action, such as installing video cameras, failed to take place after the
incident.137 Video monitoring would have monitored any areas where staff
or residents may be isolated and would have been a deterrent for staff
members committing sexual abuse. 138 To be compliant with PREA,
correctional facilities must use technological advancements as tools to
protect juveniles from sexual abuse. 139 [[Failure to act is]{.mark}
just [as detrimental as committing the act
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.140 [[Turning a **blind eye** does
not]{.mark} [eliminate]{.mark} the problem of sexual abuse [but]{.mark}
actually [**condones** it]{.mark}]{.underline}.141 Even though failure
to act is not explicitly addressed in PREA, it is implied through its
education and training policies, which ensure that youth detained in
juvenile correctional facilities are free from sexual victimization.142
Employees are required to actively prevent, detect, and respond to
sexual abuse. 143 When states violate PREA, they are causing unnecessary
harm and unlawfully subjecting juveniles to sexual abuse in detention
facilities.144 B. Sexual Victimization of Juveniles in Correctional
Facilities is Unlawful Because It Violates an Individual's Eighth
Amendment Right 134. See Poore, 46 F. Supp. 3d at 1193-94 (detailing
that Sheriff Glanz was responsible for providing adequate supervision
and protection of juvenile inmates but illustrated poor judgment and
violated both the Oklahoma Jail Standards and PREA). 135. See id. at
1195 (asserting that Sheriff Glanz was aware of the proper procedures
and his actions of sexual misconduct were in direct defiance of the
law). 136. See id. at 1198-99 (noting that after the incident was
reported, no changes were made with respect to the supervision of the
juvenile females). 137. See id. at 1199 (articulating that having video
monitoring would provide internal oversight of staff); see also NPREC,
supra note 39, at 11 (emphasizing that video monitoring would be a
useful tool to confirm staff members' movement and location, enhance
accountability, and increase reporting of sexual abuse in juvenile
facilities). 138. See 28 C.F.R. § 115.313(a) (2012) (recommending that
facilities have video monitoring to protect juveniles from sexual abuse
and ensure there is adequate supervision). 139. See id. (noting that
video monitoring can provide tangible proof of any sexual misconduct
committed by a staff member). 140. See Poore, 46 F. Supp. 3d at 1201
(stating that [[**inaction** leads to **cyclic** sexual abuse

that employees have a duty to report sexual abuse and are responsible
for adhering to policies and procedures). 142. See §§ 115.311(a),
115.331(a)(10) (mandating states to implement zero tolerance policies
for sexual abuse and ensuring that employees comply with mandatory
reporting laws).

### Contention 10: Answers to Court Clog

#### Reject consequentialist court clog arguments -- justice is inherently inconvenient because the process, not merely the outcome, matters

Right to Trial and Undermine Our Adversarial System of
Justice]{.underline}," North Carolina Law Review,
https://archives.law.nccu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1770&context=ncclr\]/Kankee

Plea bargains are meant to process convictions rather than allow juries
to decide the outcomes of cases, departing from the adversary approach
to justice required under the Constitution.so The plea bargain process
enables prosecutors to act on what would otherwise be inadmissible
evidence at trial (e.g., hearsay) in order to fashion a plea bargain and
make sentencing recommendations to the court.\' A defendant in the modem
American legal system faces two sets of injustices brought about by the
use of prejudicial and inadmissible evidence: upon indictment and
subsequently at sentenc- ing. 82 B. [[Plea Bargaining Is Merely a Tool
of]{.mark} Expediency and [Convenience, **Not
Justice**]{.mark}]{.underline} Plea bargaining now purports to be an
\"inextricable part\"8 3 of the modern criminal justice system, saving
time and limited judicial and prosecutorial resources.84 Nevertheless,
[convenience and [expediency cannot]{.mark} provide]{.underline} an
[adequate [substitute]{.mark} for [the]{.mark}]{.underline} guarantee of
trial by an impartial jury under the U.S.
**[[Constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States District
Court for the State of Massa- chusetts recently observed that: Plea
bargaining is no longer a negligible exception to the norm of trials; it
is the norm. Nor, given information deficits and pressures to bargain,
can we simply trust in an efficient plea market that reflects full
information about expected trial outcomes. Thus, plea bargaining needs
tailored regu- lation in its own right, not simply a series of waivers
of trial rights.8 5 Unfortunately, the modern purpose of plea bargaining
is too administrative, dispensing of any determination whether the
government has met the con- stitutionally required evidentiary burden of
\"beyond the reasonable doubt.\"8 6 This \"nontrial mode of procedure\"
7 does nothing to ascertain truth or serve justice. [Almost all
defendants in federal criminal cases are sentenced without the benefit
of a jury trial, notwithstanding past admoni- tion by the U.S. Supreme
Court: [The Framers would not]{.mark} [have thought it too much]{.mark}
[to demand that]{.mark}, [before depriving a man of]{.mark} \[\] more
**years** of his [liberty]{.mark}, [the State should suffer]{.mark} the
[**modest inconvenience**]{.mark} of submitting its accusation to the
unanimous suf- frage of twelve of his equals and neighbors, rather than
a lone employee of the State]{.underline}.8 9 In the eighteenth century,
Sir William Blackstone90 foresaw en- ticements that now affect the way
plea bargaining is conducted in the Unit- ed States. He noted that
\"\[[[e\]xpedience may induce **\'secret machinations**, which may
**sap** and **undermine\'** the jury trial . . . as doubtless all
**arbitrary powers**, well executed, are the most
convenient]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"91 Blackstone presciently pointed out
that \"[[delays]{.mark}, and little inconveniences in the forms of
justice, [are the price]{.mark} that all [free nations **must pay** for
their liberty]{.mark} in more substantial matters]{.underline}.\" 92
Implied in Blackstone\'s observation is the idea that [[sacrificing
justice for]{.mark} the sake of [expediency]{.mark} ultimately [di-
minishes liberty]{.mark}]{.underline}. The irony here is that, in civil
practice, the United States Supreme Court has declared, [[under]{.mark}
the doctrine of \"**[unconstitutional conditions]{.mark}**,\" that the
[government cannot require a person - for the sake of
convenience]{.mark} or expe- diency - [to give up a constitutional
right]{.mark} in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the
government]{.underline}. 93 While analogizing Fifth and Four- teenth
Amendment land use case law to the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial
escapes easy analysis, there is a core notion embedded in Supreme Court
precedent: a property owner cannot be required to sacrifice constitu-
tional rights at the discretion of government regulators where there is
no nexus between the right sacrificed and the government objective being
served. 94 In the context of plea bargains, one may reasonably
question95 whether the government can exact a waiver of one\'s
constitutional right to a jury trial for the mere sake of lightening the
workload of prosecutors and judges.96 [The adversary system that was
meant to protect the average citizen from the tyranny of its own
government is now being **abandoned** for the mere sake of expediency
and the **selfish** career goals of some prosecutors]{.underline}.
[Transparency is missing]{.underline} from the current system given that
plea bargains are typically negotiated outside open court proceedings.
Inferentially, [the government lacks sufficient evidence to meet the
requisite burden of proof in **97%** of criminal cases]{.underline} 97
by relying exclusively on plea bargains to obtain convictions. [If
prosecutors truly seek justice, they should not rely on the **secrecy**
of plea bargain negotiation]{.underline}s. [The constitutionally
required burden of proof]{.underline} for conviction [was]{.underline}
not an incidental development in law, but rather [a thoughtful and
necessary check to prevent abuse and government over-
reach]{.underline}. [If the plea bargaining process is not brought out
into the clear light of day, there is no curb on this form of
abuse]{.underline}. Notwithstanding the universal use of plea bargains
to obtain convictions, [there is practically no independent and unbiased
oversight from the judici- ary, much less the free press]{.underline}.
98 Rather, \"as the circle widens to ensnare ever more \'conspirators,\'
prosecutors trumpet their willingness to \'go wherever the evidence
leads,\' a[nd the news media are]{.underline}, far more often than [not,
pre- pared to report such news without an ounce of insight or
skepticism]{.underline}.99 C. Rise ofModern Plea Bargaining:The Impact
ofSentencing Guide- lines and Mandatory Minimums

#### Plea bargains cause court clog by creating low-cost responses -- plea bargaining's efficiency causes more cases due to freed up resources, causing the mass prosecution of barely criminal actions and the criminalization of poverty

**Hessick 21** \[Carissa Byrne Hessick, Ransdell Distinguished Professor
of Law at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where she also

Press, ISBN: 9781419750304\]/Kankee

But those consequences seem smaller when compared to the costs of the
prolonged contact with the system while waiting for trial. The very act
of being brought into the criminal justice system---even if you are
never convicted---can also have severe consequences. Defendants have to
miss school or work to attend court dates, and so the defendants may
perform poorly in class or lose their jobs if they keep returning to
court while waiting for a trial. And an arrest record---even if the
arrest never turns into a conviction---is often used by landlords,
employers, and immigration officials when they make important decisions
about people's lives. It doesn't matter to these people outside of the
criminal justice system that the defendant wasn't convicted. As law
professor Eisha Jain has explained, these people use arrest records
because those records are relatively easy and inexpensive to find, and
because they think arrests are good proxies for the potential for
violence, unreliability, or instability. Because [the difference is so
small between the consequences of a trial and the consequences of a plea
bargain, misdemeanor plea bargains might seem unimportant]{.underline},
especially when you compare their outcomes to the outcomes in felony
cases. But [it would be a mistake to ignore the problems that
misdemeanor plea bargaining causes]{.underline}. And it would be an even
bigger mistake to ignore misdemeanors when thinking about how to reform
our system. Scott Hechinger sometimes makes a stink about the silly
misdemeanor cases that he sees at arraignment. He'll say, "[[Why is this
case]{.mark} even [in the system]{.mark}]{.underline}?"
[The]{.underline} assistant district attorneys get annoyed that he is
objecting when they are giving his client a favorable deal. "The [ADAs
turn to me and say]{.underline}, '[They are going home]{.underline},
Scott. [[Why are you making]{.mark} such [a big
deal]{.mark}]{.underline}?' Then I'll say, '[[If it's not a big deal,
then **why are you prosecuting**]{.mark}?' They don't have an
answer]{.underline}." Scott's question is an important one. The [[**13
million** misdemeanor cases filed each year]{.mark} [**clog up**
our]{.mark} criminal [justice system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Especially in
large urban areas, the [[people]{.mark} inside the system have [made the
decision]{.mark} that [these cases aren't really]{.mark} [worth
it]{.mark}]{.underline}: they think that a few hours in jail or a small
fine are enough to "teach a lesson" to these defendants. [The system
doesn't]{.underline} even [care whether it has swept up an innocent or a
guilty defendant; only the defendant who is willing to endure the costs
of additional appearances has the opportunity to prove that he is
innocent]{.underline}. So [[why do we have this **bloated**
misdemeanor]{.mark} [system]{.mark}]{.underline}? Sure, some
misdemeanors are serious: domestic violence, for example, should be
taken seriously by law enforcement. But many other crimes should not. In
fact, [[it might be]{.mark} [less efficient]{.mark} for us [to
treat]{.mark}]{.underline} certain behavior---especially
[[behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} that is [[caused by]{.underline}
[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[as a crime rather than as a social
problem]{.mark} to be solved]{.underline}. [How much does it cost us to
prosecute a person who jumps the turnstile]{.underline} in the subway
rather than pay the \$2.75 fare? How much does it cost us to jail the
woman who can't pay the surcharge from her previous misdemeanor case?
[[If we]{.mark} [put]{.mark} the [resources]{.mark} that we currently
[use to]{.mark} arrest, [prosecute]{.mark}, and jail these people [into
social service programs aimed at alleviating poverty, we
would]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[certainly]{.underline}** [save
money]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [those social services would help a lot
of people who are hungry and who can't afford public transportation but
who haven't stolen food, jumped a turnstile, or committed another
crime]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the judges, prosecutors, and defense
attorneys who work in the criminal justice system don't get to make
those decisions. Decisions about poverty prevention programs and the
costs of public transportation are made by other public officials who
set local budgets and decide on public priorities. And those officials
are making those decisions---at least to some extent---based on what the
public wants. Yet I can't help but wonder whether the public would feel
the same way if they sat in those courtrooms, saw the people shuffled
through, and began to understand that [[we can't **arrest our way out**
**of** **poverty** and addiction]{.underline}]{.mark}. \* \* \* \* \*
Months after I'd been to visit Scott Hechinger in Brooklyn, I was still
bothered by the courtroom rules that he had told me about---especially
the rule about no reading. I could understand why talking on the phone
could disturb others in the courtroom, and I could understand why eating
and drinking in the courtroom could cause a mess. But reading doesn't
bother anyone, so why should it be prohibited?

#### Court clog is a self-created problem justified via circular argument -- there are too many cases because its too easy to settle a case via plea bargaining, justifying the creation of new crimes.

The Hidden Role of the Legislature One of the persistent challenges
confronted by legal scholars and practition- ers seeking to address the
ubiquity and constitutionality of the plea appears in the following
[well-rehearsed claim]{.underline}: [There are too many criminal cases
being processed]{.underline} in the states. [If every defendant chose to
assert their constitutional right]{.underline} under Article III §2 [to
a trial by]{.underline} a [jury]{.underline} of peers [the system would
collapse since there are far too few resources including courts, judges,
prosecutors, defense attorneys, private investigators, and the fiscal
wherewithal to effectively accommo- date them]{.underline}. [This is a
**red herring**]{.underline}. In fact, [the argument]{.underline}
[made]{.underline} by those who, even reluc- tantly, support the
preservation of the plea, [when confronted with challenges that raise
constitutional and justice-related concerns, **shrug** and contend that
the system]{.underline} "**[is what it is]{.underline}**," [and that we
simply have to accept the plea]{.underline} as an efficient and
pragmatic administration of justice. As this book will make clear, [this
is a **circular** **argument**]{.underline}. It is the legislatures of
each state that construct criminal sentencing guidelines. To that end,
states' general assem- blies play a pivotal role in pushing defendants
toward the plea. This is true because the [[states]{.mark} have
[created]{.mark} draconian [sentencing]{.mark} [guidelines constituted
by]{.mark} severe [mandatory minimum]{.mark} and maximum ranges for
years to be spent in prison]{.underline}. [[Defendants]{.mark}
confronting a mandatory maximum if convicted at trial [will be
**induced** to accept]{.mark} a plea bargain since the downward
departure from the mandatory maximum will often be
significant]{.underline}. It is in this way that the [[legislature
creates]{.mark} [a dynamic that]{.mark} predictably [leads to the
plea]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [[legislatures]{.mark} are the
political body that [creates crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is,
[until a behavior is officially designated as a violation of criminal
law, that behav- ior is not criminal]{.underline}. However,
[[once]{.mark} a legislature passes a statute [designating a]{.mark}
behavior a [crime]{.mark}, [**hydraulic pressure** is placed]{.mark}
upon criminal legal sys- tem actors [downstream]{.mark}]{.underline},
requiring police to arrest suspects for violations of criminal acts,
investigate those cases, and share those cases with prosecutors for
possible litigation. In short, [it is [the naming of behaviors as
crimes]{.mark} that [generates the **flood** of possible]{.mark} [cases
that must be managed]{.mark} by the criminal legal system]{.underline}.
It is in at least these two ways -- creation of draconian sentenc- ing
ranges and the naming of behaviors as crimes now ensconced in state law
-- that locates [the legislature]{.underline} of each state as a
[central agent generating the plea]{.underline}. So, to claim, [as
virtually every prosecutor and defense attorney whom I have queried
about the plea has, that [the]{.mark} criminal [legal]{.mark}
[system]{.mark} is too unwieldy as it [is deluged with too many
cases]{.mark}, signifies a circular argument [because the problem is
created by the]{.mark} [legislature itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Circular arguments signify a fallacy of reasoning or argumentation.15
Circular reasoning is known as "question begging." As is the case with
system justifications for plea bargaining, [self-dependent
justifications lead to fallacious arguments where "[the]{.mark} evidence
\[in this case, [high caseloads]{.mark}\] [presupposes the]{.mark}
[truth of the claim]{.mark} it is trying to support \[i.e., [the system
needs plea bargaining to manage high
caseloads]{.mark}\]]{.underline}."16 To summarize, [[the problem of plea
bargaining manifests the pressure accruing from excessive
caseloads]{.mark}, thereby [requiring a legal]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [capable of efficiently]{.mark} [disposing of
cases]{.mark}]{.underline}. As I have dem- onstrated, [for system actors
to justify the probity of the plea as a necessary palliative to heavy
caseloads ignores the role played by the legislature in cre- ating the
caseload dynamic in the first instance]{.underline}. It is in this way
that prosecu- tors, defense attorneys, and judges each engage in
circular reasoning since "[the evidence presupposes the truth of the
claim that it is trying to support." [More categories of crime are
created that place downward hydraulic pres- sure]{.mark}]{.underline}
upon the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and courts [to adminis-
ter them]{.underline}. Defendants, for their part, are confronted with a
devil's bargain. Either they take their chance at trial where, if
convicted, they will spend significantly greater time in prison due to
legislatively enacted sentencing ranges, or accept the downward
departure from the maximum trial sen- tence, the plea. This is what is
known as the "trial tax." Defendants are "taxed," i.e., punished, for
asserting their right to trial by risking excessive punishment.
[Criminal [legal]{.mark} system [actors]{.mark} [respond as if
the]{.mark} caseload [issue]{.mark} [appeared from **whole
cloth**]{.mark}. **It didn't**. It was and continues to emanate from [a
state]{.mark} actor]{.underline}. The syllogism, then, is something like
this: [through its [authority]{.mark} [over criminalization]{.mark} of
behavior and the setting of sentencing ranges, legis- latures [create
the dynamic leading to the proliferation of the plea]{.mark}. Hydraulic
pressure is placed upon criminal legal system actors who contend that
there are too many cases and far too limited resources for each
defendant to assert their right to trial by jury. Therefore, we must
adopt a more efficient and pragmatic technology to administer justice --
the plea]{.underline}. Two immediate responses are possible. First, the
legislature can decriminalize acts currently considered criminal. This
is especially relevant to marijuana possession and distribution, which
account for a significant proportion of state prison pop- ulations.
Second, by significantly reducing mandatory sentencing regimes, the
legislature can revisit sentencing ranges to encourage defendants to
con- sider going to trial without fear of a trial tax. In sum, [the
problem of the plea]{.underline} has partly [emerged from and been
sustained by the legislative branch]{.underline} of state government. In
the sections that follow, I will sketch out what I perceive to be the
fun- damental historical, political, and economic frames used to justify
the plea, followed by my own critique of the commodification of rights.
Part II will provide an overview of the law pertaining to plea
bargaining. Constitutional Confusion

The Author initiated this Article with a reference to the well-worn
fable made famous by Hans Christian Andersen. The Author sug- gested
that it was absolutely crystalline that the system of plea-bar- gaining
in the United States appears nakedly before us as an institutional
mechanism for enhancing an out-of-control criminal-jus- tice system. In
order to establish plea practice as constitutional, the Supreme Court
was forced to employ a juridic discourse that shifted from the language
of due process found in criminal law, especially the protections
afforded by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and toward contract law
where defendants were "free" to negotiate away their rights. This legal
maneuver is akin to the Bush Administration's use of the term "enemy
combatants" rather than "prisoners of war" be- cause the latter would
have invoked Geneva Convention protec- tions.281 The Supreme Court
applied an entirely novel standard to the adjudication of criminal
cases, and it rationalized its decision as being based on the need for
efficiency. Post-1970 Supreme Court decisions, as the Author revealed in
Section III, generated legitimacy for the plea system by referencing its
1970 precedent. Reasoning by circulus in propando, plea-bargaining was
considered constitutional because it existed, and it existed because it
was constitutional. Since the late 1960s, the Court has failed to
address the constitutionality of pleas forthrightly without shifting the
narrative away from due process and toward contract law. The reason for
this, the Author contends, is be- cause the Court's rationale would not
bear the weight of 500 years of Common Law, U.S. constitutional
mandates, and opinions of the Court extending to 1930. With the deftness
of the magician's slight of hand and the invocation of rhetorical
deception, the Court disappears criminal procedure and due process
afforded by the Constitution to all who are facing the loss of liberty
and in its place returns an entirely new rhetorical device---the law of
contracts. Those who participate in the proliferation of legal narrative
justify- ing and rationalizing the plea system, the Author argues, are
analo- gous to the vain king who, naked before all observers, continued
despite what was obviously transparent to rationalize his conviction.
The Supreme Court, prosecutors, judges, and even defense attorneys turn
to rationalization from legitimate plea practices. They have to because,
as demonstrated in this Article, neither our Common Law heritage, our
founding documents, colonial and state constitutions, nor Supreme Court
decisions until 1930 permitted plea waivers on constitutional grounds.
Each of these federal and state institutions turned to our founding
commitment to natural law and natural rights as constitutive of our
philosophical understanding of personhood and liberty. As demonstrated,
the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were considered by most to be
natural rights and, as such, were inalienable. What explains this
philosophical shift? It appears that it was the need for increased
efficiency with regard to case litigation. But how did this happen? Do
rights trump privileges with regard to the administration of pleas? Or
put another way, Does our pre-political commitment to preservation of
personhood under the law, with all its attendant quali- ties of liberty,
freedom, and security, eclipse institutional demands for efficiency?
Remember that until 1930 the Supreme Court issued opin- ions that
emphatically ruled in the affirmative. Starting in 1930 with Patton v.
United States, however, the Supreme Court did a dramatic about-face and
shifted the course of plea jurisprudence. 282 Why? Be- cause the
dramatic increases in criminal caseloads meant increasing demand for
prosecutorial and judicial efficiency. But there remains a
cart-and-horse problem. [Why were there so many cases putting nearly
insurmountable pressures on the legal system]{.underline}? [Where did
and do they come from]{.underline}? [[The]{.underline}
[problem]{.underline}]{.mark} of enhanced prosecution
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} and still is [a]{.underline} direct
[by-product of [legislative decision-making]{.mark}. [The more]{.mark}
legislators at the state and federal level define [behaviors as
criminal]{.mark} and in need of prosecution, [the greater the
resource]{.mark} [pressures]{.mark}]{.underline} con- fronting law
enforcement, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the courts to
investigate and adjudicate them. Is it really that simple? By saying so,
the Author is at risk at being labeled incompetent and stu- pid.
Clearly, by drawing attention to this simple fact, the Author pro-
claims that the emperor stands naked before us. [[There]{.mark} really
[is not]{.mark} [a]{.mark}ny [need for plea-bargaining if there are
fewer cases to litigate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[How is it that **all
other Common Law countries**]{.mark} manage to [get by with a plea
regimen that is the **inverse** of ours]{.mark}, and [yet]{.mark} still
[manage to gener- ate quite orderly civil society]{.mark}]{.underline}?
Finally, is the Author arguing for the elimination of plea-bargaining,
or a kinder, gentler, more constitutionally viable version of it?
Realis- tically, the Author joins Langer in calling for a
directed-verdict stan- dard. 283 Increased discovery coupled with more
nuanced acknowledgement of the ways in which human beings actually
process and understand information, along with a modified adversarial
due process may ameliorate some of the more pernicious aspects of plea-
bargaining. These and a host of other questions remain to be ex- plored,
but those will have to await another day. For now it is enough to say
that, as presently implemented, the usurpation and direct in- ducement
to gain convictions by encouraging defendants to abdicate their
inalienable rights is a threat to personhood and liberty in the United
States of America.

#### No court clog or crime links -- Alaska proves screening out bad cases, no wasted bargaining time, and accountability for lazy law professionals solves

**Canon 22** \[Dan Canon, civil rights lawyer and a law professor at the
University of Louisville in Kentucky, 2022, "Pleading Out: How Plea
Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class," Basic Books\]

Still, even with widespread recognition of rot at the core of the
system, Gross was taking a gamble. No one had tried banning plea
bargains in a major city in more than a century, and no one had ever
tried it statewide. Career public defender Geoffry Wildridge explains:
"Alaska was uniquely situated to adopt such a policy. It had a small
population base, lots of money (with the oil pipeline construction just
getting rolling), and criminal prosecutions were subject to statewide
supervision by the Alaska Department of Law. Av Gross and Governor
Hammond saw a chance to create a 'pure' criminal justice system."7
[The]{.underline} major [concern]{.underline}, of course, [was that
things would grind to a halt]{.underline}. But [that **didn't
happen**]{.underline}. The trial rates shot up in some places, but [the
overall time it took to resolve cases]{.underline} actually [went
down]{.underline} for a while. [[In **Anchorage**]{.underline}]{.mark},
for example, [[the]{.mark} average [time to resolve a felony]{.mark}
case [went from 192 days to]{.mark} fewer than [90]{.mark}]{.underline},
[with similar drops in **Fairbanks** and **Juneau**]{.underline}. Why
didn't the system clog? For one thing, defendants didn't stop pleading
guilty; they just stopped making deals about what would happen if they
did. Defendants could still take "open pleas," meaning they would plead
to what they were charged with and make a case as to why they should
receive a lighter sentence. But this case was made to the judge, not the
prosecutor, and in open court, not in some dimly lit conference room. In
fact, under Gross's order, prosecutors were to be "hands off" at the
sentencing stage. One prosecutor reasoned that [[this made cases move
faster]{.underline}]{.mark}: "[[Much less time is spent haggling
with]{.mark} defense [attorneys]{.mark}]{.underline}.... [I was spending
probably **one-third** of my time arguing with defense attorneys. Now we
have a **smarter use** of our time. I'm a trial attorney, and that's
what I'm supposed to do]{.underline}."8 Why would anyone take an "open
plea" without knowing what they were stepping in? For one thing, the
farce of a "contract," under which the courts pretended a defendant had
willingly bargained away their rights, was missing. [[If]{.mark} you got
[a bad judge]{.mark} who [gave]{.mark} you [a bad sentence]{.mark},
[there was a record of it, and you hadn't given up your **right to
appeal**]{.mark} the judge's decision.]{.underline} The authors of an
early study sponsored by the US Department of Justice had another
theory: The answer seems to be that some cases are "triable" while
others simply are not; they are "naturals" for a guilty plea. One
defense attorney put it this way: "Now if the guy is a 'boy scout,' I
might advise him to enter a guilty plea. Keep the image consistent---he
cooperated all the way." On the other hand, some defendants, no matter
how much they "go along with the program," will never get any
concessions by pleading guilty. For example, Alaskan judges are not
moved to sympathy by cooperative rapists.9 And sure enough, during the
period of time that the DOJ studied Alaska's ban, no one convicted of
rape received probation. The average sentence for rape was almost eight
years---a far cry from the time-outs the affluent can bargain for, as we
saw in Chapter 9. In other words, if your client is flaming- hot
garbage, you have plenty to worry about in an open plea, and it's
probably stuff you should have to worry about---not stuff that you
should be trying to bargain away without a judge ever looking at it. But
this notion of "more effective time management" gives us only part of
the picture. The bargaining ban did, in fact, fundamentally alter the
dynamics of the Alaskan system. [[Prosecutors could no longer
**cram**]{.mark} [through]{.mark} as many [prosecutions]{.mark}, and
defense attorneys had to prepare every case as though it was going to be
tried]{.underline}, which involved a lot of extra time. In Anchorage
alone, trials increased by 97 percent right off the bat. No reduction in
haggling time could have offset those major changes. Still, [the courts
continued to function]{.underline}. The most likely reason that the
Alaskan system didn't become the proverbial turtle swimming in peanut
butter is that [prosecutors got **pickier**]{.underline}. Before the
plea bargaining ban, [Alaskan district attorneys refused to prosecute
only about **4 percent** of the felony cases they received from law
enforcement. After the ban, the [**refusal rate** jumped to an
astonishing **44 percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is exactly what
Gross had intended. His first memo to state prosecutors stated, "[An
effective [screening]{.mark} of cases filed]{.underline}, for example,
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} have to be instituted in order to [[avoid
filing]{.mark} [cases]{.mark}]{.underline} which might be 'bargained'
under the existing system, but [[which could not be won at
trial]{.underline}]{.mark}." And that system of "effective screening"
was in fact instituted, with the result that [[the state]{.mark} simply
[stopped wasting time on cases it]{.mark} couldn't---or
[shouldn't]{.mark} ---[win]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Resources]{.mark}
that might have been [used on haggling]{.mark} [for a few hours]{.mark}
a day [were diverted to]{.mark} reading case files, calling witnesses,
and otherwise [determining]{.mark} the [sound]{.mark}ness of
[cases]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Then prosecutors would decide whether to
push the case forward or drop it altogether.]{.underline} Career
prosecutors seemed to like this arrangement much more than the old one.
A chief prosecutor who handled cases both before and after the ban
gushed: [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in essence, [[a **meaningless
gesture** to take in]{.mark} a whole lot of [bad cases]{.mark} [that
can't be proved and bargain them]{.mark} out for meaningless
dispositions. [It is no solution to crime]{.mark} in this country to run
someone through the process to get some]{.underline} kind of
[conviction]{.underline} [which]{.underline}, more often than not, [is
for something much less than they were accused of and which results in
something which really doesn't mean anything in terms of real
punishment]{.underline}.10 And in 1976 a justice of the Alaska Supreme
Court crowed to law professor Albert Alschuler: [A no-plea-bargaining
policy forces the police to investigate their cases more
thoroughly]{.underline}. [It forces prosecutors to screen their cases
more rigorously and to prepare them more carefully]{.underline}. [It
forces the courts to face the problem of the **lazy judge** who comes to
court late and leaves early]{.underline}, to search out a good presiding
judge, and to adopt a sensible calendaring system. All of these things
have in fact happened here.11 The arrangement left attorneys with some
flexibility, just not enough to be too dangerous. For a bargain to
happen, a local prosecutor had to get approval at the state level. That
is, approval from Avrum Gross or his deputy. As one D.A. said, "It's not
that there isn't any plea bargaining. It's just that the power to
negotiate is now localized in the chief prosecutor, and when that's the
case, there is much less bargaining." The defense bar was slower to warm
to the idea. Paul Canarsky, who was a public defender during the
bargain-ban years, recalls, "We talked about the absurdity of the ban a
lot at our office meetings/dart games/decompression sessions, and we
effectively decided that we would wear the D.A.s into the ground. We
knew we would either win the case at trial or, even if our client was
guilty, the judge would see that the case had been overcharged and we
would get a better sentence than we would have after a guilty plea."
This turned out to be a lot of work, but it wasn't all bad: "The result,
of course, was that we all did a lot of trials. I did 42 trials in 1981
and 36 in 1982. Our 'go-to-trial-on-everything' strategy worked because
there were many months when the trial stats we sent to Anchorage showed
that we got not-guilty verdicts on more than 50 percent of our cases!"12

#### Err neg -- abolition costs are tiny

C. The "Inevitability" of Plea Bargaining Abolitionists resisted the
claim that plea bargaining is inevitable. The point was developed
towards the end of our period, in response to the arguments we have just
seen from plea bargaining's defenders. In 1983 and 1984, Alschuler and
his soon- to-be University of Chicago colleague, Stephen Schulhofer,
each published major articles on alternatives to the plea bargaining
system.267 [[To]{.mark} [the claim that abolishing plea bargaining would
be too expensive]{.mark}]{.underline}, Alschuler argued that the [[costs
had been **grossly inflated**]{.underline}]{.mark},268 in large part
[[because]{.mark} [the]{.mark} actual [budget]{.mark}ary footprint of
criminal courts [was **tiny**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Even if it had to
be]{.mark} doubled or **[tri- pled]{.mark}**, [it would]{.mark} still
[be]{.mark} [**small** in comparison to other social
institutions]{.mark}. "This sort of [investment]{.mark},"]{.underline}
Alschuler implored, "[[need]{.mark} [not inspire
panic]{.mark}]{.underline}."269 To make things con- crete, Alschuler
appraised the expense, as of 1983, of providing a three-day jury trial
to every felony defendant who wanted one. [[Applying conservative
estimates]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., erring on the side of higher
rather than lower costs), he tagged [it]{.underline} [at \$843
million]{.underline}.270 That [[would be a "3**.2% increase** in civil
and criminal justice expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark}," Alschuler
noted, or about one-third of the "cost-overrun on \[Lockheed's\] C-5A
air- craft."271 On the defenders' sabotage point---i.e., that criminal
justice insiders would in- evitably sabotage any effort to abolish plea
bargaining---Alschuler accepted the premise. Some number of prosecutors,
judges, and defense lawyers would violate a plea bargaining ban, just as
some people violate the ban on murder and others violate the ban on
robbery.272 Abolishing plea bargaining, Alschuler clarified, means abol-
ishing lawful plea bargaining. He asked his readers not to be so cynical
as to assume that "large numbers" of "America's men and women of the
law" would "not only would break the law to achieve their goals, but
also that they would lie about this violation."273

#### **No trial delays - Philadelphia proves**

**Ortman 23** \[William Ortman, Associate Professor of Law at Wayne
State University, 2023, "Plea Bargaining Abolitionism: A History," Ohio

Philadelphia's criminal courts were also the subject of Schulhofer's
1984 con- tribution to the cause.278 Though Philadelphia had not tried
to abolish plea bargain- ing, Schulhofer argued that its jury-waiver
system offered a blueprint for how to do it.279 He and his research
assistants observed Philadelphia courtrooms in 1982, amassing data on
320 felony cases.280 In the sample, 44% of defendants pleaded guilty,
but only a small fraction of the pleas represented negotiated
dispositions.281 Schulhofer expected to find "tacit inducements" to
plead guilty and searched for evidence of them, but located none.282
[For defendants who pleaded not guilty]{.underline}, on the other hand,
there were clear in- ducements to waive a jury, as post-jury trial
sentences were much heavier than post- bench trial sentences.283 The
bench trials were, as Alschuler had noted, quick. In the
[courtrooms]{.underline} that [handled ordinary felonies]{.underline},
[[a]{.mark}n outright [**majority** of]{.mark}]{.underline} bench
[[trials lasted]{.mark} between [**thirty minutes** and an hour]{.mark},
while [only **2%**]{.mark} [went more than three hours]{.mark} and
[**18%** were over in less than thirty minutes]{.mark}]{.underline}.284
Nonetheless it was clear to Schulhofer after watching the trials and
speaking with the participants that [all but a handful]{.underline}
(seven, to be exact) [were genuine adversarial processes
and]{.underline} [not]{.underline}, as some earlier ob- servers had
suggested, "[slow pleas of guilty]{.underline}."285 Schulhofer
summarized what he and his team found [[in **Philadelphia**: "In
America's **fourth-largest** city]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are rel-
atively few inducements to plead guilty, [[most]{.mark} felony
[defendants]{.mark} do in fact [claim a trial]{.mark}, and their cases
are resolved]{.underline} in genuinely contested adversary
proceedings."286 "These [[findings]{.underline}]{.mark}," he added,
understating for effect, "[[cast]{.mark} some **[doubt]{.mark}** on the
wide- spread [belief]{.mark} that [case pressure]{.mark}]{.underline} or
the behavioral dynamics of criminal litigation [[make plea bargaining
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}."287 To be clear, the notion that plea
bargaining would help enable a massive and unprecedented expansion of
the carceral state---as it did in the 1980s and 1990s--- was not part of
the academic argument for abolition in the 1970s. Scholars did not
explicitly warn about the looming danger of mass incarceration, though
Alschuler came close when cautioning against determinate sentencing
reform proposals popu- lar in the late 1970s.288 But scholars did claim
that America's criminal justice appa- ratus had come unmoored from its
foundations, with calamitous consequences for fundamental values of
justice, freedom, and law itself. In the "move from adversari- ness \[to
cooperation\]," Schulhofer observed, "only one thing is lost---the
vigorous probing and questioning that, in their very unpleasantness,
have been thought to serve a crucial function in the preservation of
freedom."289 Noting Daniel Webster's pronouncement that "'law' would
hear before it condemned, proceed upon inquiry, and render judgment only
after trial," Alschuler remarked that the legal profession had "lost
sight of Webster's kind of law."290 While they may not have been able to
predict the future, abolitionists warned us about plea bargaining.

#### New Orleans proves screening solves court clog by removing low evidence, non-violent cases from the docket

**Canon 22** \[Dan Canon, civil rights lawyer and a law professor at the
University of Louisville in Kentucky, 2022, "Pleading Out: How Plea
Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class," Basic Books\]

IN RESTRICTING PLEA BARGAINING IN ALASKA, AVRUM GROSS likely sought to
emulate what New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. had already
been doing for a year. Connick made headline after headline when he
promised to eliminate plea bargaining, and he generated even more news
when he got elected and actually fulfilled that promise. Connick was a
colorful character. Early in life, he traveled the world with the Army
Corps of Engineers. He met his wife, Anita, in Morocco; they married in
Tangier; and they eventually settled in New Orleans, where the two ran a
record shop. He and Anita, both accomplished musicians themselves, put
each other through law school on the proceeds they could scrape together
from the shop and their other musical endeavors. Time published a piece
on him called "The Singing D.A."16 As one might expect, Connick's
approach to criminal law was as unorthodox as the rest of his life. In
1973 Connick beat out the incumbent D.A., former JFK murder investigator
Jim Garrison. His first order of business was to knock Garrison's modest
plea bargaining rate of 60 percent down to 8 percent (or even less---the
statistics are muddled).17 Assistant [prosecutors were not allowed to
plea bargain]{.underline} or dismiss without Connick's express
permission, which was not freely given. [[The
effect]{.underline}]{.mark} [[on]{.mark} **[New Orleans]{.mark}** legal
system]{.underline} [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}, by most accounts, more
**[[dramatic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and **more immediate**]{.underline}
[than in Alaska]{.underline}. [Garrison's]{.underline} [[prosecutors
tried **190 cases**]{.underline}]{.mark} in his [[last
year]{.underline}]{.mark} in office. [By]{.underline} [Connick's third
year]{.underline} (of a twenty-eight year stint), his office was
[[taking more than a **thousand cases**]{.mark} a year [to
trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. Still, [the [courts]{.mark} were able to
[function]{.mark}]{.underline} [because]{.underline} of the system
Connick implemented, which involved [dedicated [screening
attorneys]{.mark} who thoroughly reviewed files to decide what charges
could stick]{.underline}. [His goal was to "**[weed out]{.mark}** those
[cases]{.mark} really [**not worthy** of]{.mark} being on [the]{.mark}
criminal [docket]{.mark}]{.underline}, [so [more]{.mark} courtroom
[emphasis can be devoted to the **violent**
offender]{.mark}]{.underline}." [He wouldn't tolerate
overcharging]{.underline}; [if a screening prosecutor
charged]{.underline} too many defendants with [too much, he
would]{.underline} be made to [try]{.underline} one of [his overcharged
cases]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, as one screener put it, "**[get
his teeth kicked in]{.underline}**." [Connick's [office]{.mark}
[**rejected**]{.mark} an average of [**63 percent** of all
charges]{.mark}, a practice that, the public defender crisis
notwithstanding, kept all the necessary balls in the air.]{.underline}
Naturally, Connick was often at odds with New Orleans police throughout
his tenure. [He publicly derided]{.underline} their investigative
techniques and rejected many [cases]{.underline}---even serious
felonies---[for "poorly written or even **illegible** police
reports]{.underline}." But the no-deals policy was popular with the
public and kept Connick in office, in no small part because [he talked a
lot about justice for victims of violent crime, without sweating the
small stuff]{.underline}. Newspaper articles during his campaigns talked
a lot about "murder, rape and robbery," and not so much about marijuana
possession, even while the drug wars were raging.18 In one letter to the
editor, Connick explained: "[I know how victims feel when their case is
plea bargained away simply because some assistant and/or judge is **too
lazy** to work]{.underline}. I resent that, and I know victims resent
that. I don't permit it."19

#### Scotland proves plea bargaining is less efficient and causes court clog

**Gormley 22** \[Jay Gormley, researcher with a MA in Philosophy at the
University of Strathclyde and a LL.B in Law at the University of
Strathclyde, 5-22-2022, \"The inefficiency of plea bargaining\", Wiley

5.2 Is plea bargaining inherently problematic? The widespread belief
among policymakers when producing reforms is that it is defendants who
engage in gamesmanship. For example, it is commonplace for official
policy documentation to propose 'new procedures which get the case to
trial quickly, with reduced chances of the accused "playing the system"
and escaping justice'.61 In this context, defendants' rational tactics
are viewed negatively. Surely, it is argued, these people (who are
presumed to be guilty) should accept the solemnity of the court and 'the
system should not become a game where delay and obstruction can be used
as a tactic to avoid a rightful conviction'.62 However, there may be
hypocrisy in condemning 'games'. It might be noted that court
professionals also utilize tactics and stratagems and that this is the
norm of negotiations in Anglo-American adversarial systems. Indeed,
Section 196 (the most overt form of plea bargaining) is itself a
tactical attempt to create (dis)incentives to pleading guilty or not
guilty. Moreover, as noted, defendants often feel that it is the legal
professionals who are playing games and that they have minimal agency
regarding their participation in plea bargaining -- even if they wanted
to plead guilty. The fact that [plea bargaining itself prompts defendant
practices (notably late guilty pleas) that policymakers bemoan has
significant implications]{.underline}.63 However, perhaps this should
not be surprising. Despite stereotypical perceptions, other research in
courts has found that defendants are often more compliant than might be
assumed. In court, defendants' outward behaviour is characterized by a
'passive acceptance' of court norms.64 For example, in Jacobson and
colleagues' research (as in mine), defendants were docile in court,
disruptions were rare, and the vast majority were inclined to follow the
advice of their defence lawyers.65 In Auld Sheriff Court, the advice of
defence lawyers, more often than in Braw Sheriff Court, leaned towards
delaying a guilty plea in part because [negotiations **routinely** took
longer]{.underline}. In this way, defendants' late guilty pleas were
still passively accepting court norms and consistent with that system of
plea bargaining. In other words, [[plea bargaining demands
**gamesmanship** that requires **extra time**]{.mark} to play
out]{.underline}. In sum, policy demands plea bargaining. However, in a
significant number of cases, [plea bargaining demands **delaying** a
guilty plea]{.underline}. Defence [[lawyers and prosecutors]{.mark} in
most courts]{.underline}66 **[[struggle to
negotiate]{.underline}]{.mark}** guilty pleas early in court
proceedings. Indeed, a case\'s trajectory seems to be largely determined
by court norms for plea bargaining rather than defendants 'playing
games' and attempting to evade justice. Instead, [defendants can
be]{.underline}, more or less, '**[dummy players']{.underline}** [and
plea-bargaining norms the **source** of inefficiency]{.underline}.67 6
CONCLUSION [By drawing on recent research in Scotland,]{.underline} this
article has argued that we need to question plea bargaining\'s presumed
efficiency in terms of cost effectiveness. First, plea bargaining\'s
ability to induce guilty pleas is uncertain. We cannot know from
existing data how many guilty pleas are attributable to it. In light of
other factors that might lead to guilty pleas (such as process costs and
procedural hassles), this lack of evidence is problematic. Second, the
article has demonstrated that [plea bargaining itself can entail key
**inefficiencies**. In the Scottish research, it was found that
[expectations and perceptions]{.mark} [of plea bargaining]{.mark} were
commonly cited as a reason to [delay]{.mark} [a]{.mark} guilty
[plea]{.mark}. Thus, not only might plea bargaining]{.underline} fail to
provide the expected degree of cost effectiveness, but it may actually
[reduce cost effectiveness in some situations. A **key inefficiency** of
[plea bargaining]{.mark} is that is it [can **hinder**]{.mark}
[straightforward]{.mark} ([early]{.mark}) [guilty
pleas.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even where a guilty plea would suit all
concerned, [[negotiation norms and **incumbent** tactics]{.mark} can
[create **impediments**]{.mark} to simply admitting guilt.
[Prosecutors]{.mark} may [expect the defence to demand **concessions**,
and]{.mark} this may influence how they [(over)charge]{.mark}. In turn,
defence lawyers and [defendants]{.mark}]{.underline} may perceive there
to be overcharging and therefore [[delay pleading guilty until some
concession is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[achieved]{.mark}. The result is
that many guilty pleas take a **long** and **inefficient** path that
leads to **churn** and **cracked trials**.]{.underline} Ironically, the
inefficiencies identified above stem from the same norms encouraged by
policymakers in the pursuit of efficiency via plea bargaining. While the
prevailing belief of policymakers is that plea bargaining is and will be
expedient, in practice it is mediated through defendant perceptions and
the actions of legal practitioners with ethical obligations and other
imperatives that exist in notionally adversarial systems.68 Indeed, it
is perhaps to be expected that [real-world plea bargaining is
**problematic**:]{.underline} At an epistemological level, the adversary
system encourages a strategic, rather than a moral or even
instrumentalist approach ... Two-party litigation and negotiation, when
conducted strategically for individual client maximization, may prevent
important and relevant information from being disclosed for fear the
other side will use such disclosures 'against' the principal. In
economic terms, this may leave 'waste'.69

#### History proves plea bargaining abolition doesn't cause court clog

**Vogel 19** \[Mary Vogel, Professor of Law and Chair in Criminal Law at
the University of Manchester, 2019, "Plea Bargaining under the Common
Law," The Oxford Handbook of Criminal Process,

In sum, several clear themes surface. Despite public concern that its
leniency favors the guilty, plea bargaining also appears to assure that
more guilty persons are convicted than at trial. Both acquittals and
dismissals decline. Perhaps the greatest drawback of this practice is
its propensity to convict the innocent, especially where bargaining is
widespread and includes the weakest cases. As to whether leniency is
actually received by those who negotiate, the evidence remains somewhat
divided. The preponderance of findings suggests that bargaining usually
does yield concessions. To the extent that defendants make decisions
based on a calculation of costs and benefits, it is reasonable to think
they are influenced by the leniency on offer.149 3. Administrative
Efficiency [Proponents of plea bargaining]{.underline}, including the
U.S. Supreme Court, [argue it promotes]{.underline} administrative
[efficiency and]{.underline} conserves court resources. Some argue this
creates a "compelling" state interest in bargaining and that caseload
pressure induces bargaining. [Studies]{.underline} have
[produced]{.underline} [mixed evidence]{.underline} for these claims.
Berger studied effects of [a 1971 [prohibition]{.mark} on plea
bargaining]{.underline} for three serious crimes
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} Maricopa County,
**[[Arizona]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He [[saw **no increase** in
trials]{.underline}]{.mark}, although his analysis was relatively
casual. For example, he concluded that the bargaining ban "did not cause
a rise in number of trials" and that guilty plea rates remained about 70
percent.150 But that does not tell us whether fewer cases were charged,
more were dismissed, or tacit bar- gaining continued despite the formal
ban. Another study examined effects (during two months) of eliminating
plea bargaining for felonies [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[Iowa county]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Elimination]{.mark} [of bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark}, here, [[accompanied by]{.underline}]{.mark}
four other supportive actions.151 In that case, abolishing plea
bargaining "[[increased efficiency]{.underline}]{.mark}" when coupled
with other reforms, such as new laws permitting immunity for witnesses
who testify for the state and an alternative to prosecution through
deferred judgments and supervised release.152 [Cases filed declined 23
percent, dismissals decreased 50 percent, verdicts of guilty were
reached in 50 percent more cases, and [trials]{.mark} [increased by
**only one** single case]{.mark}]{.underline}. A third study that also
looked at consequences on caseloads in one county of banning charge
bargaining for drug-sale cases yielded markedly different findings.
Based on interviews with twenty-three prosecutors, judges, and defense
attorneys, Church con- cluded that after charge bargaining stopped, the
trial rate "soared" and cases resolved by guilty pleas "fell
considerably," although guilty pleas still produced 75 percent of con-
victions.153 From this Church inferred that implicit bargaining emerged
(possibly tacit sentence bargains), prosecutors sought more dismissals,
and trials increased for judges who were unlikely to engage in tacit
sentence bargains. Church concluded that the elimination of all
bargaining "would be accompanied by a . . . considerable increase in the
number of trials."154 Schulhofer argued that bargaining is driven
neither by caseload pressure nor court- house workgroup cooperation.
Based on observing the efficient operation of the bench trial system
used to resolve 49 percent of cases at the Philadelphia courts, he made
the case that plea bargaining is pervasive not because it is necessary
but because it serves a popular but problematic conception of justice.
Schulhofer insisted that "competitive norm\[s\] may strongly affect
behavior" within organizations as in markets. He argued that expeditious
trials, aggressive prosecutorial policies, a strong public defender's
office, and professional norms that disfavor quick compromises preserve
the adversarial process and reduce bargaining.155 In sum, while evidence
is mixed on bargaining's administrative consequences, overall the work
counsels skepticism about the assumption that bargaining fosters
efficiency. Research suggests a more complex interplay among bargaining,
caseloads, professional culture, and other factors. VII. Conclusion

### Contention 11: White Collar Crime and Pedophiles

#### White collar plea-bargain informants cause an underpunishment culture for business crimes -- they exploit their advantages to get away with the theft of billions if they plead guilty or snitch

II\. White Collar Crime and Cooperation So-called white collar or
business crime has always been treated dif- ferently from street crime.
Encompassing such offenses as fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, tax
evasion, and other nonviolent economic offenses, the white collar
category has its own culture and poses its own challenges. For one
thing, the federal government is cen- tral to white collar enforcement.
Although federal cases make up less than one-tenth of the entire
American criminal system and, numeri- cally speaking, there are more
state fraud prosecutions than federal ones, federal law enforcement
dominates this arena, especially with respect to large companies and
high-profile cases.26 Federal prosecutions tend to be complex and
resource-intensive and often have national ramifica- tions, setting the
tone in the business community for future practices. White collar
criminal enforcement also takes place against a back- drop of extensive
civil regulation and large administrative agencies that have their own
enforcement mechanisms. Most wrongful business con- duct may be treated
either civilly or criminally. As law professor Darryl Brown points out:
"Parallel statutory regimes providing civil and crimi- nal sanctions for
essentially the same conduct exist in virtually every area of
white-collar wrongdoing, including health care fraud, environ- mental
harms, workplace safety, and securities law."27 Business organiza- tions
thus typically spend more time negotiating compliance with civil
regulatory agencies than they do confronting criminal prosecutors. As a
result, business activities take place in a highly regulated atmosphere
that is already heavily layered with expectations about civil compliance
and cooperation and in which civil liability is often routinely
substituted for criminal sanctions. [The long-standing and persistent
criticism of [white collar]{.mark} criminal enforcement is that it is
**too lenient**, that white collar offenses are not vigorously pursued,
and that [offenders receive punishments that are **too
light**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2002, Forbes magazine ran a cover story
titled "[White Collar Criminals]{.underline}: They
**[Lie]{.underline}**, They **[Cheat]{.underline}**, They
**[Steal]{.underline}**, and [They've Been **Getting Away With It** for
Too Long]{.underline}: Enough Is Enough."28 The story revealed that,
from 1992 to 2001, enforcement attorneys from the Securities and
Exchange Commission referred 609 cases to the Justice Department for
potential criminal charges. Of that number, only 187 cases were actu-
ally prosecuted, 142 individuals were found guilty, and 87 went to jail.
Even the highest- profile wrongdoers served relatively low sentences. In
1986, Michael [[Milken was sentenced to ten years]{.mark} for an illegal
insider trading scheme worth upward of **\$100 million**]{.underline}.
[[He was released after]{.mark} serving just **[two]{.mark} years**
[because he agreed to cooperate]{.mark}]{.underline}.29 Charles Keat-
ing was convicted of fraud and racketeering for destroying the savings
of 23,000 bank customers and fueling the \$150 billion savings and loan
crisis in the 1980s: he served four and a half years, approximately the
same sentence he would have received for selling two tablespoons of
crack cocaine.30 There was an uptick in corporate prosecutions during
the so-called post--Enron era in response to the high-profile collapse
of firms like Enron and WorldCom. The DOJ created the Corporate Fraud
Task Force, while Congress and the U.S. Sentencing Commission increased
penal- ties for white collar crimes.31 The new wave of high-profile
prosecutions included the massive accounting firms KPMG and Arthur
Andersen, while a few executives received record-setting
sentences---Enron's Jeffrey Skilling received twenty-four years, and
WorldCom's Bernard Ebbers re- ceived twenty-five.32 But that enforcement
culture has ebbed and flowed. Most prominently, the 2008 collapse of the
financial sector generated almost no individual prosecutions, and DOJ
has been widely excoriated for treating powerful corporations and their
CEOs as "too big to jail." As federal Judge Jed Rakoff complained, the
"'too big to jail' excuse . . . is disturbing, frankly, in what it says
about the \[DOJ's\] apparent disregard for equality under the law."33
Critics have long argued that the differential treatment between white
collar and street crime reflects social biases; [because [white collar
defen- dants tend to be]{.mark} [whiter, wealthier, better educated, and
socially con- nected]{.mark} to other elites, [they receive better
treatment]{.mark} and more sympathy from the criminal system's decision
makers than do poorer, politically powerless defendants who are also
more likely to be people of color]{.underline}.34 Recall the federal
judge's conclusion that inside trader David Slaine was still "a good
person." [Even though [business crime]{.mark} can impose **substan-
tial** social harms, [strip]{.mark}ping [**innocent** victims of]{.mark}
their wealth and costing the nation literally [**billions** of
dollars]{.mark}, [white collar offenders are]{.mark} often [deemed less
culpable]{.mark}]{.underline} [than street]{.underline} crime
[offenders]{.underline}, even [though the latter]{.underline}
collectively [steal less money and harm a fewer number of
people]{.underline}.35 Or as Rhode Island justice Stephen J. Fortunato
wrote more dramatically: "[[The gentle]{.mark} and genteel
[treatment]{.mark} by prosecutors]{.underline} (with occasional no-
table exceptions) [[of corporate thieves]{.mark}, swindlers, polluters,
tax evaders, and hustlers [is proof]{.mark} positive]{.underline} that
[[there are **two**]{.mark} separate]{.underline} and distinct [criminal
[justice systems]{.mark}]{.underline} operating in this country."36 To
be sure, white collar defendants themselves may still experience race
and wealth dis- crimination: one study found that, among federal white
collar offenders, Black and Latinx defendants are incarcerated more
often and for lon- ger than their white counterparts.37 But as compared
to street and drug crime, the culture of white collar prosecution has
tended to be more lenient and restrained.38 Cooperating informants are
an important part of white collar inves- tigations and prosecutions.
Because many financial or paper crimes are hard to detect, the industry
is what the FBI calls "undercover resistant": it often requires
cooperation on the part of a knowledgeable insider to bring crimes to
light. Conversely, the threat of cooperation can serve as an informal
check on wrongdoing. After the prosecution of Rajaratnam and dozens of
other Wall Street traders, the FBI asserted that its investi- gations
had "sent a chill" through the hedge fund industry and that the agency
"ha\[d\] enough informants lined up to keep its investigations of
suspected illegal insider trading at hedge funds going for at least five
more years."39 White collar cooperation takes two main forms. One is the
now- familiar individual cooperator who, in exchange for lenience for
his or her own crimes, provides information about others' wrongdoings.
In addition, the white collar arena has produced a distinct phenomenon:
cooperation by the corporation itself. When a corporate entity becomes a
"snitch," it raises unique issues for law enforcement and for the
entity's individual employees. Both forms of white collar cooperation
(individ- ual and corporate) are discussed below. A. Individual White
Collar Cooperators The typical white collar informant is a participant
in a larger scheme to steal or defraud. For example, the government's
financial fraud cases against Enron's chief officers Kenneth Lay and
Jeffrey Skilling were built on the testimony of numerous informants,
including accountants and managers in addition to CFO Andrew Fastow.
Many of these witnesses were also guilty but received reduced sentences
in exchange for their cooperation.40 When the government suspects a
white collar offender, a number of things may happen that distinguish
this arena from street and drug crime enforcement. First, the government
may approach the suspect or their attorney, or send them a "target
letter" revealing that they are under investigation, prior to any arrest
or charges being filed. If the sus- pect does not already have counsel,
this gives them the opportunity to get it.41 Some
[companies]{.underline} actually [provide counsel for employees facing
employment-related criminal charges]{.underline}. The fact that [white
collar defen- dants have better and earlier access to counsel than do
street]{.underline} or drug [crime suspects]{.underline} radically
[improves defendant options]{.underline} in this arena. Over three
decades ago in his landmark book on white collar defense, Kenneth Mann
described the pre-indictment process as the most im- portant service a
defense attorney can provide her client. Counsel's abil- ity to control
information early on means that a defendant can shape the direction of a
case and even potentially avoid indictment altogether.42 Cooperation
makes this pre-indictment process a time of even greater opportunity and
potential negotiation for represented defendants. White collar offenders
depend heavily on their attorneys during the cooperation process. A good
defense attorney can evaluate the strength of the government's case,
advise her client about the likelihood of suc- cess, and ensure that her
client receives the greatest benefit from his cooperation. If the
government eventually charges the defendant with a crime, the attorney
remains the defendant's most important guarantee that the government
will keep its promises and that the defendant will get maximum credit
for his cooperation.43 Professor Daniel Richman points out that law
enforcement's ability to obtain cooperation depends in part on its
reputation for keeping its promises. If the government breaks its
promise, the defense attorney may be the only witness who can publicize
the breach. Richman tells the story of one attorney who took out a
public advertisement in a national legal publication, castigating the
U.S. Attorney's Office for having bro- ken its promises to his
cooperating client. The attorney wrote: During the sentence proceedings
I stated that I was going to tell every defense lawyer in our nation not
to enter any plea agreement with your office. Your office cannot be
trusted. Your office cares nothing about promises and agreements. I am
surprised that the eagle in the Great Seal of the United States didn't
fly from the wall in horror. . . . Like some sleazy insurance company
who refuses to pay the widow because it wants the premiums but doesn't
want to honor its obligations, your office will go to any length to
renege on its solemn promises.44 By way of contrast, when police break
their promises to a street-corner snitch, no one is likely to find out.
In such ways, the pervasive pres- ence of white collar defense counsel
significantly levels the playing field between suspects and the
government. Once a white collar defendant decides to become an
informant, co- operation and benefits can take a number of forms.
Typically the co- operation will involve proffer sessions with the
government in which the defendant, with their attorney, will provide
information about the scheme and others' wrongdoings. They may also be
required to testify before a grand jury or at the trial of others. In
addition to providing in- formation about past wrongdoings, they may
help investigate ongoing crimes by wearing a wire or otherwise engaging
in proactive investiga- tion. For example, while investigating Richard
Scrushy, former CEO of HealthSouth, investigators wired a financial
officer's necktie to covertly record conversations.45 [[Benefits]{.mark}
may [include avoiding indictment]{.mark} for some or all crimes that the
informant has committed]{.underline}. [The informant may also get
immunity for crimes that they admit to but the government did not
already know about and/or crimes that the government subsequently
discovers as a re- sult of the cooperation]{.underline}. Finally, [[if
they plead guilty, they]{.mark} typically [receive sentence
reductions]{.mark}]{.underline}.46 White collar cooperation agreements
tend to be complex, formal, and written. They may involve careful
descriptions of the kinds of immu- nity that a defendant is or is not
entitled to, the kinds of work he or she is expected to do, and
recommendations that the government may make at sentencing. Because
these agreements are executed over time, sometimes long stretches of
time, they must provide for the waiver or elimination of some bedrock
rules of criminal procedure such as double jeopardy, speedy trial
rights, self-incrimination rights, and others. As Professor Graham
Hughes wrote in 1992, "deals involving promises to cooperate are sharply
different from the general phenomenon of plea bargaining. They are
exotic plants that can survive only in an environ- ment from which some
of the familiar features of the criminal proce- dure landscape have been
expunged."47

#### Plea bargains let Epstein, Maxwell, and 100+ child rapists have immunity for human trafficking for decades.

100 Targets, That Have Immunity In a stunning turn of events, convicted
sex-trafficker Ghislaine [[Maxwell]{.underline}]{.mark} has reportedly
[provided Justice Department officials with information on about 100
high-profile individuals connected to]{.underline} Jeffrey
[Epstein]{.underline} . [Maxwell]{.underline} met with Deputy Attorney
General Todd Blanche over multiple days in late July 2025 and, according
to her attorney, "[[**didn't hold back**" -- answering **every**]{.mark}
[question]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.underline}]{.mark} roughly
[[**100** people]{.underline}]{.mark} who may have been involved with
Epstein's activities . This cooperative marathon is widely seen as
Maxwell angling for a presidential pardon from Donald Trump . Her
lawyer, David Markus, openly acknowledges that Maxwell "would welcome
any relief" from Trump, even as he insists "no asks and no promises"
were exchanged during the DOJ interview . This is a dramatic \[read
suspicious\] shift in the Administration's approach. During Maxwell's
prosecution in 2020-21, federal prosecutors never sought her
cooperation. In fact, Trump's Deputy AG Blanche noted that under prior
administrations, nobody even asked Maxwell if she was willing to talk .
Instead, the former DOJ pursued a straight conviction, sending her to
prison for 20 years without striking any deals for information. The
sudden decision by Trump's Justice Department to entertain Maxwell's
information now -- even hinting at clemency -- is suspicious. It
suggests a calculated gambit: Trump may use Maxwell's intel as a weapon
against a roster of powerful figures that until now have escaped
accountability. Why Cut a Deal Now? Why didn't prosecutors under
previous leadership seek Maxwell's help to reel in bigger fish? One
theory is that prosecutors were reluctant to pursue Epstein's
well-connected friends -- perhaps to avoid entangling political VIPs.
Maxwell's attorney now praises Trump for "his commitment to uncovering
the truth", implying the last DOJ lacked such commitment . Skeptics see
something more cynical: Trump's team might be seizing this opportunity
not purely for justice, but to selectively target Trump's political
adversaries under the guise of law-and-order. Indeed, Trump himself has
sent mixed messages about the Epstein saga. On one hand, his Attorney
General Pam Bondi initially promised a full accounting of Epstein's
crimes, feeding supporters' hopes of a grand expose. But just this
month, the administration backtracked on releasing more Epstein files,
provoking outrage among Trump's own base. Some of Trump's most ardent
allies had long insisted a hidden "client list" of Epstein's associates
was being covered up by Democrats . Now, with Trump in charge, those
allies are "skeptical" of the DOJ's sudden claim that there's "nothing
left to disclose" . In response to backlash, Trump lashed out,
dismissing the Epstein frenzy as "the Jeffrey Epstein hoax" and calling
supporters who cling to it "weaklings" fooled by political opponents .
He even complained the Epstein case was "pretty boring" and that all
"credible information has been given", urging people to move on . Yet
behind the scenes, Trump's Justice Department was quietly reaching out
to Maxwell, possibly to placate those very supporters with real action.
Blanche publicly declared that "no one is above the law -- and no lead
is off-limits," saying he contacted Maxwell at the direction of AG Bondi
to ask "what do you know?" . Within days, Maxwell was sitting down with
DOJ interrogators. The timing suggests Trump's team is performing a
difficult balancing act: showing a willingness to pursue Epstein's
network (to satisfy political pressure) while controlling the narrative.
By leveraging Maxwell's secrets, Trump can claim to be delivering
justice apolitically -- even if the outcome conveniently singes his
rivals. **[[Epstein's]{.mark} "[Sweetheart" Deal Granted Maxwell
Immunity]{.mark}]{.underline}** To understand the stakes, one must
[revisit the]{.underline} extraordinary [plea deal Epstein struck in
2008]{.underline} -- [a deal so **lenient** and **secretive** that a
federal judge later called it a **brazen** **violation** of the law
.]{.underline} Back in the mid-2000s, local police in Palm Beach amassed
evidence that [[Epstein was]{.mark} sexually [abusing **dozens** of
underage girls]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[Epstein]{.mark} [was a
wealthy financier with powerful friends]{.mark}, and the justice system
responded in unprecedented fashion]{.underline}. Instead of a federal
sex-trafficking indictment, [prosecutors quietly negotiated
a]{.underline} non-prosecution agreement ([NPA]{.underline}) [that shut
down the federal case entirely .]{.underline} [[Epstein pleaded
guilty]{.mark} only [to]{.mark} two [minor]{.mark} state
[charges]{.mark} of prostitution (one involving a minor]{.underline}),
[for which he served 13 months]{.underline} in a county jail part-time
(allowed to leave for work during the day) . Even more shocking was a
clause buried in the deal: [[the NPA granted **immunity** to]{.mark}
"any potential [co-conspirators]{.mark}]{.underline}" [[who helped
Epstein]{.underline} [procure girls]{.underline}]{.mark} .
[[This]{.mark} provision effectively [**shielded**
others]{.mark}]{.underline} in Epstein's orbit -- [including
Maxwell]{.underline} -- [[from]{.mark} federal
[prosecution]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [it was all done behind closed
doors. The teenage victims were never informed of the plea
arrangement]{.underline} at the time, a fact a judge later ruled was a
blatant violation of the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. "I'm
relieved that the court agrees [it was wrong to hide this child rapist's
**pathetically soft deal** from his victims]{.underline}," Senator Ben
Sasse said when that ruling came down, blasting the "heartbreaking and
infuriating" conduct of prosecutors . Why would the government agree to
such a sweetheart deal? Critics have long suspected that [Epstein's
influential connections and potential dirt on VIPs **greased the
skids**]{.underline}. By 2006, media outlets in Florida were sniffing
around the case, noting how [Epstein initially got off with a mere
solicitation charge.]{.underline} Facing mounting public scrutiny -- and
perhaps pressure from above-- federal attorneys led by U.S. Attorney
Alexander Acosta worked out the hush-hush plea. An internal DOJ review
in 2020 found [Acosta]{.underline} showed "poor judgment" in resolving
the case through this non-prosecution pact and failing to ensure victims
were told about Epstein's state plea hearing . But the review stopped
short of finding misconduct; it painted a picture of prosecutors who
[wanted the Epstein problem to go away quietly rather than risk a
high-profile trial that could drag powerful people into the
spotlight.]{.underline} Judge Kenneth Marra's 2019 ruling showed how
unusual the Epstein arrangement was. He flatly concluded that
prosecutors "violated the rights of victims" by concealing the agreement
. However, [Marra did not invalidate the NPA, leaving it legally intact
even as Epstein's crimes --- and the identities of any co-conspirators
--- remained shrouded in secrecy . [Epstein's "**deal of a**]{.mark}
**[lifetime]{.mark}**]{.underline}," as it's been called, [[held]{.mark}
firm: he served brief jail time, then resumed his life
(until]{.underline} a new wave of charges in [2019]{.underline}).
Meanwhile, [Maxwell and others in [his circle]{.mark} enjoyed **[de
facto immunity]{.mark}** [for years]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's this "odd
reality" -- [that Epstein's deal arguably protected the very accomplices
who enabled his abuse -- that Maxwell is now trying to exploit in
court.]{.underline} Maxwell's Supreme Court Gamble: Can Epstein's Deal
Shield Her? Maxwell's legal team is mounting a bold argument: they claim
[[Epstein's]{.mark} 2007 non-prosecution [agreement]{.mark} also [bars
Maxwell's]{.mark} own [prosecution]{.mark}]{.underline} [on
sex-trafficking charges]{.underline}, even though her case was brought
in a different state over a decade later . In a petition filed to the
U.S. Supreme Court, Maxwell contends that [the Epstein
deal]{.underline}, [by its plain language, **immunized** "any potential
co-conspirator" -- and thus should have prevented the Southern District
of New York from ever indicting her in 2020]{.underline} . It's a novel
question of law. Does a plea agreement with one U.S. Attorney's office
bind federal prosecutors elsewhere? Lower courts have mostly rejected
Maxwell's stance, but there is a split among federal appeals courts on
this issue. Notably, some circuits have suggested that such agreements
could have nationwide scope, while others disagree . Maxwell's lawyer
argues that this unsettled legal point warrants the Supreme Court's
attention. Even a former federal prosecutor, Mitchell Epner, observed
that the circuit disagreement means "there is a chance" the high court
will take it . The Trump Justice Department, for its part, is urging the
Supreme Court not to intervene and to leave Maxwell's conviction intact.
In a July filing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that whatever
the circuit split, Maxwell's case was a poor vehicle for review --
because a plea deal's scope is ultimately "under the control of the
parties to the agreement." In other words, Epstein's deal was struck in
Florida and bound that district's prosecutors; it shouldn't tie the
hands of New York prosecutors who were not party to it. Trump's DOJ thus
finds itself in the somewhat awkward position of defending the validity
of Maxwell's conviction -- even as Trump's political allies suggest he
might pardon her anyway for cooperating. The Supreme Court is expected
to decide in the fall whether to hear Maxwell's appeal. If they do take
the case, it could result in a landmark decision by mid-2026 on whether
[Epstein's old sweetheart deal truly gave **lifelong immunity** to his
associates. Such a ruling would have enormous implications --
potentially nullifying Maxwell's conviction and others]{.underline}, or
conversely affirming that no one can hide behind Epstein's plea bargain
except Epstein himself. Trump's angle is clear: Pardon Maxwell to moot
the appeal and pursue Epstein co-conspirators. High-Profile Names in the
Crosshairs

CHAPTER EIGHT THE COSTS: TRUTH AND JUSTICE Multimillionaire Jeffrey
Epstein was accused of sexually exploiting dozens of underage girls, but
he served only thirteen months in jail. His case largely escaped public
notice until the Miami Herald published an exposé in the fall of 2018.
The paper reported the sordid facts of sexual coercion as well as a
secret plea deal in which Epstein pleaded guilty to two prostitution
charges in state court. In return for that guilty plea, the federal
government agreed to close its investigation into sex trafficking and
other crimes. The public was outraged. The Herald identified
approximately eighty women who claimed that they had been sexually
abused by Epstein when they were teenagers. Epstein paid the girls not
only to give him massages and engage in sex acts but also to bring more
girls to him. With his victims acting as recruiters, Epstein was able to
secure a steady stream of underage girls for his sexual gratification
over the course of several years, sometimes molesting multiple girls in
a single day. Many of the accusations involved sexual abuse by Epstein
at his home in Florida. But there were also allegations that Epstein had
supplied underage girls to other men at sex parties that he hosted.
These sex party allegations were especially explosive because Epstein's
social circle at the time included former President Bill Clinton,
England's Prince Andrew, and Donald Trump, who was president when the
story broke. After the Herald's story was published, a 2002 quote from
Trump surfaced in which he said that Epstein was "terrific" and that he
"likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the
younger side." Trump made that comment at the same time that accusers
say Epstein was cycling dozens of underage girls through his Florida
home. The sordid facts and the mere implication that powerful people may
have attended Epstein's sex parties would have been enough to ensure a
media firestorm. But the Herald's reporting also indicated that Epstein
received unusually favorable treatment from law enforcement. Despite
what seemed like significant evidence of sex trafficking, federal
prosecutors decided not to pursue charges against Epstein. They entered
into a deal with Epstein in which he could plead guilty to state
prostitution charges and, in return, no federal charges would be brought
against him or any of his accomplices. The deal was shrouded in secrecy.
The meeting to arrange this deal was held at a hotel rather than at the
prosecutor's office. Federal prosecutors worked with Epstein's defense
lawyers to limit press coverage of the case. Prosecutors also failed to
notify Epstein's victims, who were entitled to know about the deal under
federal law. The federal prosecutor who agreed to the extremely lenient
plea deal, Alexander Acosta, quickly became the focus of intense public
outrage. Acosta was serving as President Trump's secretary of labor when
the story broke. He gave an awkward press conference in which he tried
to defend himself. But the press conference didn't work. Acosta resigned
two days later. As the furor over the story crested, federal law
enforcement took action. Epstein was arrested on sex trafficking charges
in New York. The FBI raided his Manhattan town house, where they found
nude pictures of underage girls. Prosecutors claimed that Epstein and
his employees brought underage girls to the town house so that Epstein
could molest them. Epstein was denied bail and awaiting trial in federal
custody when he committed suicide in August 2019. Epstein's story
captured the public's imagination at least in part because of his wealth
and personal connections. The media reporting on the case emphasized
that Epstein was able to use his significant personal wealth and his
relationships with powerful people to obtain favorable treatment. [If
not for Epstein's money and connections, the stories suggested, his
victims would have had their day in court and Epstein would have served
the lengthy sentences that we impose on sex offenders]{.underline}. I'm
not so sure. Don't get me wrong: the criminal justice system treats
wealthy people better than those without money. And I have no doubt that
knowing powerful people can get you even more favorable treatment. But
[[favorable plea deals]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [sidestep]{.mark} terrible
facts]{.underline}---especially [when it comes to crimes involving
[sexual abuse]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[[are the rule, not the
exception]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in the criminal justice system. You
don't have to have millions of dollars or be friends with a president
and a prince. [You just have to [convince a prosecutor]{.mark} that [it
isn't worth the time or]{.mark} the [effort]{.mark} to try and prove a
particular set of facts]{.underline}. [[As long as you]{.mark} are
willing to [plead guilty to something]{.mark}]{.underline}, some
[prosecutors do not need a lot of convincing]{.underline}. Their goal is
to ensure that the case is disposed of efficiently---that the defendant
is convicted and receives at least some punishment. [Getting at the
truth would require a jury and a trial, neither of which is convenient
or efficient, and so prosecutors want to avoid both.]{.underline} \* \*
\* \* \* The envelope was so large, my assistant took it out of my
faculty mailbox and kept it at her desk for me to pick up. I was in the
middle of a big research project collecting records from district
attorney elections, and so she was used to taking giant envelopes out of
my mailbox. But this envelope didn't contain copies of the dusty,
somewhat boring election records that I was collecting. It contained
evidence that would rattle most Americans, shaking their faith in the
criminal justice system---provided they had the ability to understand
it. When I first opened the envelope, I didn't appreciate what I saw. It
contained a document that was more than 130 pages long. The document
listed [**hundreds** of cases]{.underline} [from]{.underline} Cuyahoga
County, the second-largest county in Ohio, which includes the city of
[Cleveland]{.underline}. The cases [were sex crimes]{.underline} that
had been [pleaded down to far less serious charges]{.underline},
oftentimes [having **nothing** to do with sex]{.underline}. And there
were a lot of them. As I read through the descriptions, I was astounded
by what I saw. One [defendant]{.underline} had been [charged with raping
a child]{.underline}, but he had pleaded guilty to "interference of
custody" and served only six months in jail. Another defendant was
charged with [kidnapping]{.underline} and anal rape but pleaded guilty
to aggravated assault and attempted abduction. His sentence was three
years of probation. A third defendant engaged in a sexual relationship
with a girl who was only twelve years old. They had sex multiple times a
week for years. He pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated assault and
was sentenced to five years of probation. The list of cases went on and
on. A small handful of cases involved [child pornography]{.underline} or
[soliciting a minor]{.underline} to engage in sexual activity. But the
overwhelming majority were cases of [child molestation, rape, or sexual
assaults]{.underline} against adults and children---[literally
[**hundreds** of **very lenient** plea deals for **very** **serious**
crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. I was surprised by how little punishment
these defendants received. Legislatures routinely pass laws that
increase punishments for sex crimes. There are so many laws because sex
offenders are some of the most reviled people in the criminal justice
system. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, several states
started to adopt laws that imposed the death penalty on defendants who
raped children. But the U.S. Supreme Court struck those laws down,
saying that it was unconstitutional to execute people who hadn't killed
anyone. While they couldn't execute sex offenders, state legislatures
did what they could to eliminate them from society. They passed laws
that not only kept sex offenders in prison for long periods of time but
also restricted where they could live, work, and even walk once they
were released. Ohio is no exception when it comes to these laws. It
imposes long mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted of rape.
Rape carries a mandatory sentence of three years in prison. And other
sex offenses carry mandatory minimum penalties of five, ten, or fifteen
years. Ohio also requires sex offenders to register with the state and
imposes residency restrictions on them. Based on these laws, the people
of Ohio probably think that anyone who commits a rape or molests a child
will spend a long time in jail and will be monitored after release. But
that isn't what happens. The list of cases that I read showed that these
[[harsh laws are **routinely circumvented**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
list spanned a little over a decade, [[from 2005 to
2017]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Of the hundreds of cases included, [fewer
than **60**]{.mark} [resulted in prison sentences]{.mark} [longer than
a]{.mark} [year]{.mark}]{.underline}. And nearly [**[250
cases]{.underline}** [resulted in **no jail time**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[whatsoever]{.underline} for defendants: they were sentenced to
probation or a fine, or their jail sentences were suspended by the judge
at the time of sentencing. In other words, [[because of **plea**]{.mark}
**[bargaining]{.mark}**]{.underline}, these [defendants]{.underline}
spent much less time in jail than the mandatory minimum sentences
required---and many [didn't have to go to jail at all]{.underline}. And
for the many defendants who weren't pleading guilty to sex crimes,
[[they were]{.mark} [not subject to sex offender registration]{.mark}
requirements or residency restrictions]{.underline}. Of course, as I
read through the case descriptions, I didn't know whether the defendants
actually committed the crimes that they were charged with. The mandatory
minimum sentences, the sex offender registry, and the other restrictions
on convicted sex offenders no doubt placed a lot of pressure on all of
those defendants to plead guilty. So it was possible that I was looking
at a list of innocent people who had been forced to plead guilty. Or I
might have been looking at a list of people who committed heinous crimes
and suffered very few consequences. I couldn't tell. But either way the
list was deeply troubling: if these people hadn't committed crimes, then
they shouldn't be convicted; if they had committed these crimes, then
their punishments seemed much too lenient. Even more troubling was that
people in Ohio almost certainly didn't know that this was happening.
Unless they or someone they knew was involved in one of these cases,
they don't know that [prosecutors are willing to bargain serious sex
crime charges down to less serious convictions]{.underline}. And because
the public doesn't know, they can't make their public officials tell
them why little or no jail time seemed like a good resolution in these
cases. To put it simply, since the plea bargaining process wasn't
transparent, voters couldn't hold their officials accountable. One man
in Ohio wanted to change that. \* \* \* \* \* Judge Michael Donnelly has
deep concerns about plea bargaining. As a former prosecutor, Donnelly
was both familiar and comfortable with plea bargaining in 2005, when he
was elected to serve as a trial court judge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. At
first he thought of plea bargaining the same way that he did when he was
a prosecutor: that is to say, he thought that plea bargaining was a good
way for the two sides in a criminal case to negotiate a resolution. Just
as two lawyers in a real estate transaction might haggle over the sale
price or the closing date, plea bargaining allowed the prosecutor and
the defense attorney to haggle over what the right punishment would be
for a defendant. Or so Judge Donnelly had been taught as a prosecutor.
Once he was on the other side of the bench, Judge Donnelly started to
look at plea bargaining differently. He was no longer one of the lawyers
engaged in a negotiation. Instead he was the judge, and so he was
supposed to be a neutral party in the process. Soon that process began
to concern him. Initially, Judge Donnelly was concerned only about the
judge's role in the off-the-record hearings that occurred in Cuyahoga
County before guilty pleas. In those hearings, the prosecutor and the
defense attorney would tell the judge about the case and then would ask
whether he would be willing to accept the plea that they had negotiated.
Sometimes the judge would say no, but more often than not the judge
would say yes. If the judge decided to accept the plea bargain, then he
had to decide what sentence to impose on the defendant. Unlike in the
federal system and some other states, judges in Ohio have a lot of
flexibility in deciding what sentence to impose. Judge Donnelly noticed
that the lawyers were saying things in the off-the-record conference
that they wouldn't say in open court---things that could make a serious
difference in a judge's sentencing decision. This made him
uncomfortable. For example, a former trial court judge told Judge
Donnelly about a prosecutor who would appear in her courtroom. The
former judge had thought very highly of this prosecutor, but she knew
that he was often in trouble with his supervisor for not being
aggressive enough. The supervisor wanted the prosecutor to demand higher
sentences, but the prosecutor didn't agree. The prosecutor told the
judge about the problem with his supervisor. And sometimes, in
off-the-record hearings, the prosecutor would give a sentencing
recommendation and then warn the judge that he was going to argue for a
harsh sentence later, in open court. As he told the judge, he would
argue for the harsh sentence in open court in order to satisfy his
supervisor, even though he personally didn't think that such a severe
sentence was necessary. This was a clear signal to the judge that she
should impose a lower sentence than what the prosecutor would argue for
in open court. The judge who told Judge Donnelly this story thought it
showed the benefits of off-the-record hearings and why they should
continue. Those hearings allowed her to get a candid sentencing
recommendation from the prosecutor without getting him in trouble with
his supervisor. But Judge Donnelly didn't see it that way. He saw the
story as an illustration of why these hearings should be stopped. "What
good did that do to anybody?" he asked me. "Was there a victim in that
case who didn't know that the prosecutor was being disingenuous?" Judge
Donnelly began to realize that prosecutors and defense attorneys were
striking deals that left victims and the public in the dark about what
actually happened. And he worried about the role that judges played in
all of it. He noticed that the on-the-record proceedings in which the
defendant pleads guilty sometimes made reference to facts that were
completely different from those in the off-the-record conference. He
realized that some defendants were pleading guilty to entirely different
sets of facts or even crimes than what had been discussed beforehand.
Judge Donnelly was especially concerned about this practice in cases
involving rape and sexual assault. Based on the difference between what
was discussed in the off-the-record conferences and then what was said
in the courtroom, he realized that [prosecutors were repeatedly letting
defendants accused of serious sex crimes plead guilty to charges that
had nothing to do with sexual assault even though the
prosecutors]{.underline} appeared to [think that the
defendants]{.underline} actually had [committed sex crimes]{.underline}.
The more of these cases Judge Donnelly saw, the more concerned he
became. [How many sexual assaults were being treated like]{.underline}
other, [less serious]{.underline} types of [crimes]{.underline}? He
looked into it, and the result was a long list of cases---the large
document that showed up in my mailbox. Judge Donnelly was horrified when
he found all of these cases. As a judge, he was especially worried that
those [[plea bargains **obscured** whether the defendants were repeat
offenders]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[If]{.mark} one of these same
[defendants committed another rape in the future]{.mark}, [the next
judge **would not know**]{.mark}]{.underline} that the defendant had
committed sex offenses in the past. As a result, [the defendant would
probably get a lesser sentence than if he were a repeat
offender]{.underline}. [Or he might be permitted, once again, to plead
guilty to a lesser, nonsexual offense]{.underline}. Judge Donnelly also
worried about the victims in these cases. Some cases had been pleaded
down to a particular type of low-level assault that was available only
for defendants whose victims were partially at fault for the crime.
Those were the sorts of charges that prosecutors might bring against a
defendant who was in a bar fight if the victim had started the fight.
"[Could you imagine being the victim]{.underline} in that sort of case?"
Judge Donnelly asked me when we spoke on the phone. "[The defendant
sexually assaulted you. And the public record in that case says you were
partially to blame]{.underline}." As his uneasiness grew, Judge Donnelly
changed plea bargaining practices in his own courtroom. He ended all
off-the-record conferences for plea bargaining, and he informed lawyers
that he wasn't going to accept pleas for charges that weren't supported
by the facts. Not content to allow these plea bargaining practices to
continue in other courtrooms, Judge Donnelly also tried to change the
court rules that allowed them. He drafted a new state rule that would
bring more transparency to plea bargaining by requiring that
plea-bargained convictions be based on the facts of the defendants'
crimes. He brought the rule to the Ohio Supreme Court--- which is
responsible for writing the court rules in the state---but the justices
there rejected it. Undeterred, Judge Donnelly took his fight to voters.
Ohio, like many states, elects its judges. And so Judge Donnelly ran for
a seat on the Supreme Court of Ohio. As part of his campaign, he talked
about the need to change plea bargaining in the state. And he won. Judge
Donnelly is now Justice Donnelly. As of January 2019, he sits on the
Ohio Supreme Court. And he is now one of the people who will make
decisions about court rules. \* \* \* \* \* You might think that the
problem of overly lenient plea bargains is limited to sexual assault
cases because those cases often get treated differently. Sexual assaults
are rarely reported. Police are less likely to believe victims of sexual
assault than victims in other types of cases. And prosecutors will often
refuse to bring charges even when police have arrested a suspect. As a
result, even when they are reported, sexual assault cases rarely result
in convictions. So it shouldn't be surprising that prosecutors are more
likely to offer overly lenient plea deals in sexual assault cases; after
all, they are less likely to pursue those cases in the first place. But
sexual assault is hardly the only area of the law where plea bargains
routinely and systematically obscure the facts. Take, for example, cases
involving guns. Many places have passed laws that impose harsh
punishments on people who possess or use guns illegally. But prosecutors
routinely use those laws only as a way to pressure defendants into
taking a plea to a lesser crime rather than to actually make defendants
serve long prison sentences. This practice is so common in federal court
that it has a name: "swallowing the gun."

#### Plea bargains allow secret coverups that hide info about sex offenders like that would be found out at trial -- this allows follow-on crimes given that the public doesn't know

**Hessick 21** \[Carissa Byrne Hessick, Ransdell Distinguished Professor

But she never heard that message. She didn't even know whether the
prosecutor understood why she had been arrested. Because the defendant
thought that the resolution of her case might have been a big mistake,
it is hard to believe that she heard any message at all. \* \* \* \* \*
Defendants aren't the only group of people who have lost rights and
opportunities; victims also suffer in a system of plea bargains. [Trials
of guilty defendants allow victims an opportunity to participate in the
criminal justice system and have their voices]{.underline}
[heard]{.underline}. A system of [[plea bargains]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only **[eliminates]{.underline}** [that participation but also
**[shrouds]{.mark}** the resolution of [cases in
**secrecy**]{.mark},]{.underline} sometimes [leaving victims **unable**
to understand what happened or why]{.underline}. [This lack of
understanding can be **incredibly difficult** for victims to deal
with]{.underline}. When I first started teaching, I had a student whose
father had been killed several years before. The student had gone to law
school, in part, because of her father's death. The prosecutor gave the
defendant who had caused her father's death a plea bargain under which
he pleaded guilty to something other than murder and served a few years
in jail. Years later, the student and her family were still devastated:
[not only was her father dead]{.underline}, but the[y never understood
why the man who killed him got that deal.]{.underline} They didn't think
the sentence was long enough, and they didn't understand why the
prosecutor didn't insist on the defendant pleading guilty to murder. The
student said that they had asked the prosecutor these questions but he
didn't really answer them. Instead, he made some vague statements about
the strength of the evidence in the case---at least, the statements were
vague to my student and her family. During the years that she was in law
school, the woman came to my office several times to give me more
details about her father's case. She wanted me to help her understand
the decision the prosecutor made. But I couldn't help her. I could
explain how plea bargaining works generally, but I didn't have access to
information about her father's case. This is the other side of the
morality play that Bibas describes. [Trials don't just send messages to
defendants; they also send messages to victims. Trials tell the story of
what the defendants did and how that behavior affected the
victims]{.underline}. [Sometimes the victims themselves get to testify,
allowing them to tell their own stories]{.underline}. [[Having the
opportunity to tell his story]{.mark} in open court and hear a jury say
that the defendant is guilty can give a victim a sense of
**closure**]{.underline}. [Guilty verdicts]{.underline} don't undo the
harm that a victim suffered, but the verdict [[lets the victim know that
his community agrees with]{.mark} him that what the defendant did was
wrong]{.underline}. Not everyone agrees that trials are better for
victims. Sometimes crime victims don't want to testify at trial---maybe
because they are afraid of the defendants or maybe because they don't
want to relive the terrible experiences of the crimes themselves. And
those who see the victims' rights movement as just another way to push
for harsh law-and-order policies might worry that having victims testify
at trial could lead to more convictions or harsher sentences. Those
victims who don't want to testify shouldn't be forced to do so. But
[some crime victims do want to testify at trial; they want to be a part
of the process that decides guilt and punishment for the people who
harmed them]{.underline}. [This was one of the complaints]{.underline}
that Jeffrey [[Epstein's]{.mark} [victims]{.mark} raised]{.underline}.
[They [were **outraged**]{.mark} not only [by the]{.mark} lenient way he
was treated but also by the [**denial** of an opportunity to speak out
about what happened to them]{.mark} and to have that pain and violence
acknowledged.]{.underline} [[A system without trials deprives victims of
the ability to]{.mark} participate and the ability to [feel
heard]{.mark}]{.underline}. As for whether victim participation might
result in more convictions or harsher punishment, that's far from clear:
juries might be skeptical of victim testimony, and a clearer picture of
the harm victims suffered might actually result in less punishment for
those defendants who cause less harm. But even if it did result in more
convictions and more punishments, those [convictions]{.underline} [would
be the result of more and better information about what the defendants
actually did]{.underline}. Trials allow us to draw more accurate
conclusions about what defendants did and the effects of their actions.
That accuracy is important, even if it makes us think some punishments
are too lenient. \* \* \* \* A system without trials doesn't just affect
victims and defendants; it also deprives the general public of the
opportunity to participate in the criminal justice system by serving on
a jury. It might seem strange to argue that people should have the
opportunity to sit on a jury, since most people probably think of jury
duty more as a chore than as an opportunity. Jury duty can involve long
waits on uncomfortable chairs, and the whole exercise may seem somewhat
pointless

#### Plea bargains hide virtually all info from the public

I. LACK OF T RANSPARENCY IN P LEA B ARGAINING Although plea bargaining
is the standard method by which criminal cases are resolved today, its
operation remains informal and obscure. Any negotiations between the
parties remain off the record and closed to the public.19 Neither the
victim nor the defendant is typically present during the negotiations,20
and the judge is usually not privy to them either. 21 In most
jurisdictions, judges are expressly prohibited from participating in
negotia- tions out of concern that their involvement might be too
coercive and might prejudice them in the event the negotiations fall
apart and the case proceeds to trial. 22 Typically[, [plea offers are
not]{.mark} publicly announced or placed [on the
record]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They are]{.underline} often [not even
reduced to writing, but are instead conveyed
**informally**]{.underline}---over the phone, in the courtroom corridor,
or in the prosecu- tor's office. 23 Even when written down, [they are
rarely entered into a database]{.underline} that could be searched to
compare results. 24 Instead, [any records of plea offers typically
remain in the prosecutor's paper file]{.underline} (which is **[closed
to outsiders]{.underline}**), [or in an email shared only with the
defense attorney]{.underline} working on the case. 25 [[Recording
remains **haphazard**]{.underline}]{.mark} and highly variable from
prosecu- tor to prosecutor and from office to office. 26 If an offer is
accepted, the resulting plea agreement is more likely to be written down
and filed with the court. Yet even this custom is not uniform across
jurisdictions. [Only about **half** of the states require that the
agreement be disclosed on the record, and an even **smaller** group
mandate that the agreement be placed in writing]{.underline}. 27 Both
caselaw and anecdotal accounts con- firm that [[oral plea agreements
are]{.mark} not un[common]{.mark}]{.underline}, 28 [even in
jurisdictions that require the agreement to be in writing]{.underline}.
29 It is only when a plea agree- ment is filed with the court or
disclosed on the record that it becomes acces- sible to the public. 30
[Even when [a]{.mark} [plea agreement]{.mark} is disclosed on the
record, it does not always provide adequate transparency]{.underline},
for several reasons. First[, it may not contain the full terms of the
bargain]{.underline}. 31 Omissions are especially likely if the
[parties]{.underline} are attempting to [**[conceal]{.underline}** [a
fact bargain]{.underline}]{.mark} [from the court]{.underline}. 32 Even
when a plea agreement is in writing and lays out all the applicable
terms, it usually does not provide a justification for the terms
negotiated. 33 Nor does it dis- close the steps that led to the final
agreement, including terms rejected or modified. The failure to record
plea offers and plea agreements is part of a broader problem of lack of
transparency in the criminal justice system, par- ticularly with respect
to prosecutorial decisionmaking. Prosecutors are not required to provide
reasons for their charging or plea-bargaining decisions, nor are they
required to publicize any policies that they may follow in reach- ing
those decisions. 34 Even when prosecutors do record the charging and
plea decisions, these [data often remain "**buried**" in paper
files]{.underline}. 35 And while criminal case data are becoming
increasingly digitized, information about different steps in the process
often remains spread across multiple systems and databases. As a result,
tracking how a plea offer fits with other decisions made in the course
of a case, from pretrial to sentencing, and comparing cases based on
their characteristics remains a daunting task. 36 Detecting and
analyzing patterns in prosecutorial charging and plea decisions is
likewise a continuing challenge. 37 The stage at which the defendant
formally tenders a guilty plea before the court---known as a plea
hearing or plea colloquy---occurs in public and can provide some
transparency. 38 At this hearing, the court must ask ques- tions to
determine whether the guilty plea is voluntary, knowing, and factu- ally
based. 39 If sufficiently probing, these questions could reveal the full
terms of the underlying bargain. But in practice, the public plea
hearing fails to compensate for the many unknowns earlier in the
bargaining process. [[Plea hearings]{.mark} tend to be brief affairs and
usually [do not unearth]{.mark} [less visible charge and fact
bargains]{.mark} or the reasons behind any plea
concessions]{.underline}. 40 Furthermore, [because plea hearings occur
only after the parties have agreed on a disposition, the
[parties]{.mark} have every incentive to [keep from the court facts that
may disturb the]{.mark} [agree- ment]{.mark}]{.underline}.41
[Defendants]{.underline} thus [give "**scripted
responses**]{.underline}" to the judge's formulaic questions and read
statements prepared by their lawyers ahead of time. 42 Sentencing
hearings provide another opportunity for the public to learn the factors
that shaped the outcome of a negotiated case. But [sentencing hearings
are]{.underline} also [frequently brief]{.underline} [and
**uninformative**]{.underline}---particularly when the parties have
agreed upon a sentence. These hearings often fail to clarify whether and
in what way the negotiations influenced the ultimate sentence. They
rarely reveal whether or what charges were dropped, reduced, or
declined.43 In a negotiated case, the parties have agreed on a sentence
or sentence recommendation, so they often have no incentive to argue
about the sentence at the hearing. Furthermore, if the defendant rejects
a plea offer and is convicted after a trial, the sentencing hearing does
not disclose the differential between the rejected plea offer and the
posttrial sentence. In brief, much plea-related information is absent
from the sentencing hearing, so its publicity does not make up for the
opacity of the process that precedes it in negotiated cases. II.
CONSTITUTIONAL C OMMITMENT TO P UBLIC C RIMINAL P ROCEEDINGS [The lack
of transparency in plea bargaining contrasts sharply with our
longstanding legal commitment to public criminal
proceedings]{.underline}. This com- mitment is rooted in the English
common law 44 and enshrined in the Sixth Amendment, which provides that
"\[i\]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to
a . . . public trial." 45 State constitutions, statutes, and judicial
decisions have long affirmed the same principle. 46 [Open criminal
proceedings were conceived as a fundamental right for criminal
defendants because of the recognition that transparency helps ensure
fair treatment]{.underline}: "The knowledge that every criminal trial is
subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an
effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power." 47 The
publicity of criminal proceedings is further safeguarded by the First
Amendment.48 As the Supreme Court has explained, the rights to free
speech and free press presuppose the right to receive information about
the workings of the government---including how criminal proceedings are
han- dled.49 [[The First Amendment]{.mark} thus "[goes]{.mark} beyond
protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals [to
prohibit government from limiting]{.mark} the stock of
[info]{.mark}rmation [from]{.mark} which members of [the public]{.mark}
may draw]{.underline}." 50 Today, courts frequently view the Sixth and
First Amendment rights to a public crim- inal proceeding as coextensive.
In deciding how broadly to apply the constitutional provisions on
public- ity, courts examine the functions and purposes of these
provisions. Accord- ing to the Supreme Court, the right to a public
trial helps ensure fair treatment of the defendant and advances the
truth-seeking goal of the justice system.51 [Public proceedings can
enhance the accuracy of the outcome by encouraging witnesses to come
forward]{.underline}. 52 The possibility of public scrutiny also
encourages participants to follow the rules, remain impartial, and stay
"keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility" in dispensing justice.
53 As Jus- tice Harlan remarked, "the public-trial guarantee embodies a
view of human nature, true as a general rule, that judges, lawyers,
witnesses, and jurors will perform their respective functions more
responsibly in an open court than in secret proceedings." 54 By
promoting the fairness and integrity of the pro- ceedings, public access
benefits not only the defendant, but also "society as a whole."55
Openness is also critical to ensuring that the proceedings are perceived
as fair and legitimate. As the Supreme Court has explained, "public
access to the criminal trial fosters an appearance of fairness, thereby
heightening pub lic respect for the judicial process." 56 Writing for a
plurality in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, Chief Justice Burger noted
the longstanding common- law position that openness of criminal
proceedings has a "therapeutic value" for the community and enhances
"public acceptance of both the process and its results." 57 As he
elaborated, ["\[p\]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility
from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what
they are prohibited from observing]{.underline}." 58 Critically,
[publicity allows citizens to monitor judicial proceedings for
unfairness and injustice and to hold governmental officials accountable
for such abuses]{.underline}. The Supreme Court has repeatedly called
attention to this long- standing function of publicity, noting that the
public trial "guarantee has always been recognized as a safeguard
against any attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.
The knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to contemporaneous
review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on
possible abuse of judicial power." 59 Public criminal pro- ceedings
allow the community to hear and evaluate the reasons given for
acquitting or convicting a defendant of particular charges and, in the
event of a conviction, the reasons for a particular punishment. Such
transparency of reasoning is important to ensuring that a verdict is
based on the facts and the law and not on partiality or incompetence. As
legal philosopher Jeremy Bentham declared, "Without publicity, all other
checks are insufficient: in comparison of publicity, all other checks
are of small account." 60 Finally, public proceedings inform citizens
about the functioning of the criminal justice system. This knowledge
allows them to "effectively partici- pate in and contribute to our
republican system of self-government." 61 Citi- zens who have seen
firsthand the imperfections and injustices of the criminal process are
better able to advocate for reforming it. 62 Public access not only
ensures a fair proceeding for the defendant, but also guarantees to the
public a right to witness how criminal justice in its name is dispensed.
For that rea- son, the right to a public trial does not belong merely to
the accused, but is rather "a shared right of the accused and the
public, the common concern being the assurance of fairness." 63 While
the text of the Sixth Amendment speaks of the defendant's right to a
public trial, courts have extended both the Sixth Amendment and the
First Amendment rights of public access to a range of nontrial
proceedings, including some relating to plea bargaining. In determining
whether public access applies to a nontrial judicial proceeding, courts
have applied the "experience and logic" test. Under it, they examine
"whether the place and process have historically been open to the press
and general public" and "whether public access plays a significant
positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question."
64 Public access is more likely to be granted if it "would serve as a
curb on prosecutorial or judicial misconduct or would further the
public's interest in understanding the criminal justice system."65
Courts have generally "protect\[ed\] access unless its denial is
longstand- ing and functionally necessary." 66 Grand jury proceedings,
for example, remain secret because they have historically been exempt
from public access and secrecy is necessary for their proper
functioning. 67 By contrast, under the logic and experience test, courts
have extended the right of access to other nontrial criminal
proceedings, including jury selection 68 and prelimi- nary,69
suppression, 70 and sentencing hearings. 71 Courts have also applied the
right of public access to plea hearings. 72 Accordingly, governments
must take all reasonably available measures to accommodate such access.
73 The extension of publicity rights to plea hear- ings makes sense in a
world where jury trials are the exception and guilty pleas are the norm.
74 In fact, the bypass of the jury, which during trial serves as "an
inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and
against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge," makes public access
to plea-related proceedings "even more significant." 75 The presence of
the public at plea hearings can help ensure fairness by "monitoring the
adminis- tration of justice by plea." 76 It helps "discourag\[e\] either
the prosecutor or the court from engaging in arbitrary or wrongful
conduct." 77 Public access to plea hearings and sentencing hearings also
"reveals the basis on which society imposes punishment." 78 It informs
the community about the opera- tion of the criminal justice system and
enables more effective public partici- pation in democratic government.
79 A number of courts have also confirmed a Sixth Amendment and First
Amendment right of public access to plea agreements and plea hearing
tran- scripts.80 This result flows out of caselaw affirming that the
right of public access to criminal proceedings "extends to the documents
filed in connec- tion with those proceedings." 81 Besides the
Constitution, the common law further protects access to judicial
documents. 82 The right of access to public plea agreements hinges on
the agreements being judicial records---that is, being filed with the
court or disclosed on the record at the plea hearing. 83 Accordingly, in
jurisdictions where plea agree- ments are not placed on record with the
court, the doctrine of public access does little to ensure transparency
in plea bargaining. Likewise, the right of public access does not extend
to plea offers---at least not to those offers that, as is the custom,
have not been placed on the record. 84 The few courts that have
considered the question have also refused to extend the First and Sixth
Amendment rights of public access to plea negoti- ations.85 As one court
explained, such negotiations are "private matters between the parties,"
they have not "historically been open to the press and general public,"
and "public access to such negotiations could obviously play a
significantly harmful role, rather than 'a significantly positive
role\[,\] in the functioning of the \[negotiation\] process.'" 86 The
court never elaborated why public access would "obviously" harm plea
negotiations, leaving the func- tion and desirability of secrecy in such
negotiations unexamined. In brief, while constitutional rights of access
extend to proceedings and records that document the final outcome of
plea negotiations, the negotia- tions themselves remain shielded from
access under the assumption that neither experience nor logic calls for
greater disclosure. The next two Parts critically examine the reasons
for and against transparency in plea bargain- ing, showing the limits to
the assumption that secrecy in plea negotiations is functionally
necessary. III. REASONS FOR N ONTRANSPARENCY

### Contention 12: Innocents

#### Plea bargains cause a vicious cycle, making it both easier to convict innocents with larger caseloads and less screening, and undermining the guilt/innocence distinction,

II\. PLEA BARGAINING UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM A. Is
ConvictingMore Innocent People Necessarily a Bad Thing? \"[One should
**recoil** at the thought of convicting of innocent
defendants]{.underline}.\" 95 [Convicting the innocent is **wrong**.
Does it follow that the system which convicts fewer innocent defendants
is to be preferred to one that convicts more?]{.underline} Some would
argue that this is not necessarily true; it is not problematic that more
innocent persons are convicted in a system that permits plea bargaining.
Frank Easterbrook took this position, noting that the source of the
injustice is not the plea bargain, but \"rather, that innocent people
may be found guilty at trial.\" 96 This is correct. The calculus by
which innocent persons accept reduced sentences is predicated on there
being a chance that the innocent person will be convicted at trial,
notwithstanding his innocence. If innocent defendants could be assured
of acquittal at trial, then no offer of a lesser sentence would induce a
guilty plea.97 Bibas responds that \"[even if it is sometimes rational
for an innocent defendant to plead guilty, the criminal justice system
is wrong to encourage it]{.underline}.\"98 However, this does not quite
respond to Easterbrook\'s point. Positing a class of cases in which an
innocent person stands a one-in-twenty chance of conviction at trial,
Easterbrook concludes that \"given the regrettable fact that courts make
mistakes, [no principle of justice calls for **executing** that unlucky
\[innocent person convicted after trial\] rather than allowing all
twenty to plead and receive low sentences]{.underline}.\" 99 Easterbrook
is not contending that what is rational in an instance is systemically
good. He is suggesting that what is systemically necessary- that some
innocent persons will be convicted even at trial-renders otherwise
unappealing options potentially appealing. Were no innocent persons
convicted at trial, there would be no basis to support a system that
caused innocent persons to plead guilty. Where trial cannot prevent
wrongful convictions, Easterbrook sug- gests there is no basis to
require minimizing the wrongful convictions if doing so undermines the
ex ante welfare of innocent persons charged with a crime. If you knew
you were innocent and knew that you would be charged with a crime, would
you prefer to be charged in a system that permits plea bargaining, or
one that does not? From the perspective of the individual affected,
there is no basis not to prefer plea bargaining. There is no cost (to
that person); if the offer is not preferable to trial (which the
defendant would assess according to how he perceived the chance of
acquittal), trial remains an option. The calculus shifts if considered
across a different population or at a different time. For example,
Easterbrook is considering the value to the set of twenty innocent
persons who have been charged and who face a one-in-twenty chance of
conviction post-trial. For these twenty persons, the risk of the severe
post-trial penalty may make the option of a lesser pre-trial remedy
appealing. This conclu- sion is inherent in what was illustrated by the
hypothetical in Part I: there are plea offers that, analyzed rationally,
are better than trial even for innocent defendants. However, the
question remains: what percentage of the population do those twenty
persons represent? [[Where convictions are]{.mark} [**too easy** to
secure]{.mark} [because of lax]{.mark} plea bargaining [rules]{.mark},
the number of [innocent]{.mark} persons charged could rise]{.underline}.
This is the point made by Gazal-Ayal. 100 Gazal-Ayal argues that the
primary problem stem- ming from plea bargaining is not that innocent
defendants are induced to plead guilty through the practice of plea
bargaining; rather, [it is that by diminishing the cost to the
prosecutor of bringing weak cases]{.underline}, [plea bargaining
decreases the incentive to properly **screen out** weak cases through
prosecutorial discretion at the outset]{.underline}.101 This important
consideration seems to be unaccounted for in Easterbrook\'s analysis.
[[Any remedy that renders convictions of the innocent too easy
introduces]{.mark} [the]{.mark} risk of a **[vicious cycle]{.mark}**:
[easy convictions limit prosecutorial incentives to]{.mark} rigorously
[screen cases]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[charging too many innocent
persons undermines the correlation between guilt and
conviction]{.underline}]{.mark}. As described above,10 2 [[where
that]{.mark} [correlation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} too [attenuated]{.mark},
[the]{.mark} criminal [justice system will cease to deter
crime]{.mark}]{.underline}. Often, the attack on plea bargaining
concentrates on the harm it causes to the defendants wrongfully
convicted. That harm is significant and deserves attention. Less plain,
but of equal or greater concern, is the harm that systematic wrongful
convictions can cause to the perceived legitimacy of the legal system as
a whole. B. The Importance of the PerceivedLegitimacy of the Legal
System

#### Plea bargains are coercive and convict innocents -- stats and experiments prove

**Dervan et al. 23** \[Lucian E. Dervan, professor of Law and Director
of Criminal Justice Studies at the Belmont University College of Law,

of Technology, and Thea Johnson, Professor of Law at Rutgers Law School

Similar language appeared five years later in Menna v. New York,51 where
the Court wrote, "a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual
guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it quite
validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case."52 In the 1985
case of Hill v. Lockhart,53 the Court, quoting language from the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, said, "'the concern
that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an
innocent defendant is only rarely raised by a petition to set aside a
guilty plea.'"54 But, as the David Vasquez case illustrates,
[[defendants]{.underline}]{.mark} since the Brady decision [have often
been [confront]{.mark}ed with [bargains so coercive]{.mark} that [even
the innocent will]{.mark} sometimes [falsely
confess]{.mark}]{.underline} in return for the benefits of the bargain.
[As evidenced by data from several exoneration and innocence databases,
the decision]{.underline} by Mr. Vasquez [to falsely plead guilty is
**not an anomaly**]{.underline}.55 Consider, for example, a 2015 report
from the National Registry of Exonerations on the issue of Innocents Who
Plead Guilty.56 [[Of]{.mark} the first 1,700 [exonerees]{.mark} in the
database, [**fifteen percent** pleaded guilty to an offense they did not
commit]{.mark}]{.underline}.57 In some types of cases, the rates of
false pleas are astonishingly high.58 For example, [[drug crimes]{.mark}
comprised **forty percent** of all guilty plea exonerations, with
**[sixty-six percent]{.mark}** of exonerations [involving a false guilty
plea]{.mark}]{.underline}.59 In Harris County, Texas, [the report noted
that [there were **seventy-one** drug exonerations since
2014]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the defendants in [**every** one]{.mark}
of those cases [falsely pleaded guilty]{.mark}]{.underline}.60 According
to the National Registry of Exonerations, "most of these defendants
accepted plea bargains to possession of illegal 'drugs' because they
faced months in jail before trial, and years more if convicted."61 The
general percentage of exoneration database cases involving false pleas
of guilt has also risen over time.62 In 2021, for example, the National
Registry of Exonerations added 161 new cases.63 Of that number,
[forty-eight, or almost thirty percent, involved false pleas
of]{.underline} [guilty]{.underline}.64 While statistical analysis of
exonerations indicates that false guilty pleas, such as Mr. Vasquez's,
are not anomalies, laboratory evidence has also established this fact
over the last decade. In an article published in 2013, Dervan and Edkins
conducted a psychological deception study considering the likelihood
that a defendant would falsely plead guilty in return for the benefits
of a bargain.65 As noted above, many have assumed over the years that
plea bargains are inherently reliable, in part because innocent
defendants will inevitably proceed to trial in hopes of vindication.66
This study sought to consider the accuracy of these assumptions through
laboratory testing of decision-making and human behavior.67 The study
involved students participating in what they believed to be a test
designed to understand individual work versus group work through a
series of LSAT-style questions.68 In reality, the inquiry was interested
in how students would respond to accusations of cheating where a plea
bargain was offered.69 To examine how people respond in the face of
actual accusations of wrongdoing where offers of leniency are proposed,
all of the students participating in the test as study participants were
accused of cheating.70 In reality, the paradigm was structured so that
only about half of the students actually engaged in this misconduct.71
The other students completed the test on their own without offering
improper assistance to the confederate who was in the room with them.72
Regardless of factual guilt or innocence, and without yet knowing which
of the participants had actually cheated, all of the participants were
offered a bargain in return for confessing to the alleged offense. If
the student admitted to cheating, they would lose their compensation for
participating in the study. This was viewed as akin to probation or time
served. The participant was also informed that if they refused the deal,
the matter would be referred to an "Academic Review Board." This board
was described to the participants in a manner that made it sound very
similar to a criminal jury trial, including the right to present
evidence and testify. If convicted before the board, the participants
were told that they would lose their compensation, their faculty adviser
would be notified, and they would be required to attend an ethics
course. This ethics course was viewed as a loss of time, akin to a
period of incarceration. While this scenario did not perfectly recreate
the actual criminal justice system, the anxieties experienced by
participants were similar to, though presumably not as intense as, those
experienced by people facing criminal charges. Further, this research
advanced our understanding of defendant decisionmaking in ways that
earlier studies utilizing only hypothetical scenarios could not. In
response to \[the\] cheating paradigm, \[eighty-nine\] percent of the
guilty participants took the plea offer. [With regard to the innocent
students, **[56 percent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [participants were
willing to falsely confess to an offense they had]{.mark} [not
committed]{.mark} [in return for]{.mark} the benefits of [the
bargain]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the majority of innocent students who
knew definitively that they had not violated the rules, it appears that
accepting the deal simply made more sense.73 The results of the
psychological deception study supported the proposition that cases like
Mr. Vasquez's and those identified by the National Registry of
Exonerations were not anomalies.74 Further, the results indicated that
the assumptions of courts and others regarding how innocent defendants
behave when given the choice between proceeding to trial or accepting
the benefits of a bargain are wrong.75 Subsequent [studies]{.underline}
by other laboratories have [validated]{.underline} these [results and
found similar rates of false pleas in modified plea bargaining
scenarios]{.underline}.76 According to Wilford and Wells, [[there
are]{.mark} now several "[real-stakes]{.mark}" (i.e., non-hypothetical)
[studies recording false plea rates]{.mark} near or [**exceeding**
**fifty percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.77 In considering false guilty
pleas, their impact on victims, and how their prevalence might be
reduced, one must examine the forces that lead to such acts by the
accused. Research during the last decade has revealed defendants plead
guilty for a variety of reasons and that a host of factors influence
these decisions. Often, the reasons for pleading guilty relate to guilt
in the matter, but there are other considerations.

#### Plea bargains' mass coercion and innocent convictions harms justice system credibility -- it makes convictions seem arbitrary and unrelated to guilt

INTRODUCTION [Guilty [pleas]{.mark} routinely [are secured
by]{.mark}]{.underline} something akin to
**[[coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although courts require defendants
to affirm that pleas are given freely and voluntarily, many [[pleas are
entered under]{.mark} the threat of **[severe
penalties]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} the defendant or her
[loved ones]{.mark}]{.underline} should she not plead guilty. And, [the
law-]{.underline}as a matter of law-largely **[ignores]{.underline}**
[this]{.underline} [pressure]{.underline}.\' [Plea
bargaining]{.underline} does enhance efficiency. The legal system, as
presently struc- tured and funded, could not generate the number of
convictions it does by trial alone. 2 However, efficiency [comes at a
significant cost]{.underline}: [innocent defendants are
**induced**]{.underline} [to plead guilty]{.underline}. [More
[innocent]{.mark} defendants are [convict]{.mark}ed by plea bargains
than would be by trials alone.]{.underline} [These wrongful
convictions]{.underline} not only harm the innocent persons who plead
guilty; they [**[undermine]{.underline}** [the **reliability**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [all [convic-
tions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Plea bargaining has often been
understood to replicate or approximate likely trial results through
freedom of contract. \"\[T\]he classic shadow-of-trial model predicts
that the likelihood of conviction at trial and the likely post-trial
sentence largely determine plea bargains.\"3 Lately, this view is
increasingly subject to challenge. In his influential article, Plea
Bargaining Outside the Shadow of Trial, Stephanos Bibas challenged the
classic model by identifying [inefficiencies in the contracting
process]{.underline} that limit the influence of the likely outcome at
trial.4 William Stuntz-who co-authored one of the most influential
articles on plea bargaining as contracts-largely agrees that the
inefficiencies [undermine the ability of plea bargaining to generate
results aligned with likely trial outcomes]{.underline}.6 Just as [it
fails to track the likely consequences of trial]{.underline}, [[plea
bargaining]{.mark} [may]{.mark} also [do a **poor job**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [aligning]{.mark} criminal [consequences]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} actual [guilt]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider the recent,
high-profile prosecution of Broadcom executives over backdated options.
In that case, a federal court rejected the previously-entered guilty
plea and dismissed the indictment against Dr. Henry Samueli. Dr. Samueli
\"pleaded guilty in June 2008 to one count of making a false statement
to the Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to pay \$12 million
to the Treasury.\" 7 After Samueli completed two days of testimony as a
defense witness in a co-defendant\'s trial, the judge asked him to step
off the witness stand and face the bench.8 When Samueli did so, the
judge told him that, on the basis of his testimony, there was
insufficient evidence to support the plea of guilty.9 The court rejected
the plea and dismissed the indictment. 10 Not only was Samueli innocent,
there was insufficient evidence to support even a guilty plea: so why
would he have pled guilty in the first place? \[Samueli\] said he had
agreed to plead guilty and pay the penalty because he didn\'t want to
put his family through the ordeal of a public trial-or risk a prison
sentence. \"It was a personal decision, based on what I would have had
to put my family through,\" Samueli said under questioning from \[his
co- defendant\'s attorney\].11 Sometimes innocent [people plead guilty
because they do not believe they can prevail at trial]{.underline}.
Sometimes [they do so because they do not wish to risk the more severe
sentence that will result if they lose at trial]{.underline}. Sometimes
[they do so for personal reasons]{.underline}. The practice of [plea
bargaining]{.underline}-granting a benefit to the defendant in exchange
for the waiver of certain trial and appellate rights- [provides an
incentive to plead guilty]{.underline}. [Plea bargaining generates
outcomes that may have less to do with the weight of the evidence than
they do with the **psychological temperament** of the defendant
and]{.underline} the [charging options available]{.underline} to the
prosecutor. Put simply, [[plea bargaining has **little** to do
with]{.mark} actual [guilt]{.mark} or innocence]{.underline}. And yet,
it is the method by which [almost all criminal convictions are
obtained]{.underline}.12 [Criticism of]{.underline} the practice of
[plea]{.underline} [bargaining is extensive and well
developed]{.underline}.1 3 Generally, these criticisms have concentrated
on the fact that bargaining fails to get the \"right\" results:
\"\[Plea\] bargains reflect much more than just the merits\....
\[[[S\]tructural distortions]{.mark} [pro- duce **inequities**]{.mark},
[**overpunishing** some defendants and **underpunishing** others based
on wealth]{.mark} and other legally irrelevant
characteristics]{.underline}.\"\' 4 There is, however, another problem
with plea bargaining. [By failing to generate results
correlated]{.underline} [with the likely outcome at trial, [plea
bargaining **undermines**]{.mark} the **[legitimacy]{.mark}** of the
criminal justice system]{.underline}. As courts have long noted and
empirical research has confirmed, [the perception of legitimacy is a
**crucial** aspect of a legal system\'s efficacy]{.underline}.15 [The
perception of integrity is predicated in **significant** part on whether
and how well the system functions in accord with basic rules of
procedural fairness]{.underline}. Whether these rules are approached
empirically or normatively, there is significant overlap in the factors
that generate. procedural fairness; common examples include neutrality,
lack of bias, treating like cases alike, accounting for relevant
differences, and providing parties an opportunity to be heard. 16
Systems that fail to operate in accord with such principles lose some
legitimacy. And plea bargaining-at least as currently practiced-is at
odds with many of these principles. This Article considers those aspects
of plea bargaining that cause the most harm to the legitimacy of the
criminal justice system. It proceeds in three parts. In Part I, I argue
that, under the current system, probable cause is the only effective
standard of proof applied to bargained-for guilty pleas. Working within
the framework of recent literature that exposes the disconnect between
plea bargaining and the likely results of trial, I illustrate that the
results of [plea bargaining will have little to do with actual guilt or
even the weight of the evidence]{.underline}.
[[Trials]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [are centered around
evidence]{.underline}. [Adversaries]{.underline} are permitted to
[present evidence, in accord with well-established rules, to impartial
finders of fact, who then weigh the evidence]{.underline}. [The
[**presumption of innocence** and]{.mark} the government\'s **[burden of
proof]{.mark}** beyond a reasonable doubt [cause]{.mark} the
[evidence]{.mark} to be weighed in a manner that [favors]{.mark}, by
design, [wrongful acquittals]{.mark} over wrongful
convictions]{.underline}. The distinction between the processes that
lead to bargained-for convictions and those resulting from a trial are
significant; the former is less reliably linked to evidence and actual
guilt than the latter. In Part II, I explore the impact of plea
bargaining on the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. By
generating less reliable results than trial, plea bargaining harms those
wrongfully convicted.1 7 However, there is a systemic harm as well.
Notwithstanding the lesser reliability of bargained-for guilty pleas,
the legal system treats such convictions as formally identical to
convictions after trial. [[Symmetrical]{.underline} [treatment of
**asymmetrical**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[convictions generates]{.mark} a
[discord that threatens]{.mark} the perceived [legitimacy]{.mark} of the
criminal justice system]{.underline}. [The legal system\'s [failure to
account for the **difference in reliability**]{.mark} between
bargained-for convictions and convictions by trial repre- sents a
[fail]{.mark}ure [to]{.mark} [abide]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the axiom that
[like cases should be treated alike]{.mark}]{.underline} (and its
corollary: cases that are relevantly and materially different should be
treated differently).1 8 Moreover, [[the]{.mark} legal [system]{.mark}
**[compounds]{.mark}** this [harm]{.mark} [by]{.mark} generally
[requiring]{.mark} defendants who wish to benefit from a plea bargain to
confess factual guilt (as opposed to merely entering a formal plea of
guilt]{.underline}).\' 9 [[The innocent defendant]{.mark} who wishes to
secure leniency is given an incentive [to lie.]{.mark} [This **impugns**
the character]{.mark} of the legal system]{.underline} and can deny
defendants a meaning- ful opportunity to be heard or to participate in
the process. In Part III, I propose that the legal system openly
acknowledge the compromise between efficiency and reliability inherent
in plea bargaining through a few simple rules. First, where a guilty
plea is obtained through promised leniency, the result of the plea
should be formally distinct from the conviction secured by trial.
Second, the defendant should never be compelled to admit factual guilt
to secure the benefit of a bargain. The proposed rules give rise to
valid concerns, each of which are addressed. Implementing these two
modest rules would limit the harm that plea bargaining presently causes
to the perceived legitimacy of the legal system. Additionally, it might
generate the political will to reform the practice of plea bargaining
more completely. I. PLEA BARGAINING CAUSES MORE INNOCENT DEFENDANTS TO
BE CONvICTED That [[plea bargaining]{.underline}
[represents]{.underline}]{.mark} something of [[an **affront** to the
rule]{.mark} [against coerced confessions]{.mark}]{.underline} has been
oft-noted20 and more often ignored.2 1 The objections that have been
leveled against plea bargaining are numerous and diverse,22 but most
stem from a common problem: [plea bargaining reduces the ability of the
criminal justice system to avoid convicting the innocent]{.underline} A.
Legal Mechanismsfor Preventing Conviction of the Innocent
[Ideally]{.underline}, [our]{.underline} system of criminal [justice
sacrifices]{.underline} a degree of [accuracy in favor of avoiding
conviction of the innocent]{.underline}. Implicit in the generally
accepted requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is
agreement that accuracy in the simple sense is not the sole or even the
paramount objective of the criminal justice system. [This standard of
proof]{.underline}, like other procedural requirements, [is intended to
prevent inaccurate convictions even at the expense of inaccurate
acquittals]{.underline}.2 3 Historically, [the law has valued avoiding
convictions of the innocent more highly than maximizing convictions of
the guilty]{.underline}. Rules and procedures aim to align the results
of criminal cases accordingly, most notably by [presuming defendants
innocent and requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt for convic-
tion]{.underline}. \"The requirement that guilt of a criminal charge be
established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt dates at least from our
early years as a Nation.\"2 5 Although the Constitution does not refer
to either the presumption of innocence or the require- ment of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, courts have long assumed both have
constitutional standing.26 These concepts have generally 2 7 -though not
always28\_ been recognized as components of the requirement that
\"\[n\]o person shall be. . . deprived of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.\" 2 9 [Demanding proof beyond a reasonable
doubt for a conviction skews the error rate between wrongful convictions
and wrongful acquittals]{.underline}, [decreasing the former at the
expense of increasing the latter]{.underline}.30 As Justice Harlan
wrote, \"the trier of fact will sometimes, despite his best efforts, be
wrong in his factual conclusions.,31 Requiring proof beyond a reasonable
doubt for criminal convictions influences the relative frequency of
these two types of erroneous out- comes \... \[and therefore\] should,
in a rational world, reflect an assessment of the comparative social
disutility of each\.... In a criminal case . .. [we do not view the
social disutility of convicting an innocent man as equivalent to the
disutility of acquitting someone who is guilty]{.underline}.3 2
Blackstone is often quoted: \"[the law holds, that it is better that ten
guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer]{.underline}.\" 3 3
But is that really the ratio? In the Supreme Court\'s earliest
exploration of the substance and interrelation of the presumption of
innocence and the reasonable doubt standard, the Court identified three
distinct ratios of error presented by three sources in the span of three
paragraphs: twenty to one; five to one; and ten to one.34 This may seem
a matter of how each author chose to express himself, rather than a
meaningful meditation on the correct balance. But the correct balance is
important. As Scott Sundby has written, \"\[f\]ew would advocate, for
instance, that the government\'s burden of proof should be beyond all
possible doubt or, more vividly, that \'it is better to let one million
guilty people go free than to convict one innocent person.\"\' 35 Sundby
observes that \"a tension exists between \'elevating the impulse of
compassion\' and acknowledging \'the unlovely necessity of
self-protection.\"\'36 Whether we are willing to let five, ten, twenty,
or a million guilty people go free before convicting one innocent person
does matter. Although there is broad and deep disagreement as to the
function of punishment, \"\[m\]ost observers-of the criminal law agree
that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in
particular, is the control of crime.\"3 7 And as Sundby notes, criminal
law\'s ability to control crime depends to some degree on obtaining the
correct ratio between wrongful acquittals and convictions: \[I\]t is
obvious that if our ratio \[of guilty persons acquitted per innocent
persons convicted\] is extended indefinitely, there comes a point when
the whole system of justice has broken down and society is in a state of
chaos. In short, it is only when there is a reasonable and uniform
probability of guilty persons being detected and convicted that we can
allow humane doubt to prevail over security.38 The statement is correct,
but incomplete. There are actually two points on the spectrum where
order will give way to chaos. The first is that described by Sundby,
where the number of guilty persons acquitted is so high as to undermine
the authority of law. The other is where [the number of [innocent
persons convicted]{.mark} [**undermines** the]{.mark} perceived [merit
of]{.mark} a [conviction]{.mark}]{.underline}
[altogether]{.underline}-that is, [where too many innocent persons are
convicted for [the public]{.mark} to [recognize]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
meaningful [correlation between guilt and
punishment]{.mark}.]{.underline} 39 In either case, [the power of
law]{.underline} as a tool. of social control [[is]{.mark}
**[undermined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Allowing \"humane doubt to prevail
over security\" is a sort of luxury affordable only where there is
reasonable and uniform probability of convicting the guilty; however,
the caveat is that reasonable and uniform [conviction of the guilty
serves the interest of the system only where it can be achieved without
too many wrongful convictions]{.underline}. Requiring a heighted stan-
dard of proof for a criminal conviction stems from a recognition that a
[wrongful conviction is worse than a wrongful acquittal]{.underline}.40
[Wrongful acquittals are preferable to wrongful convictions because the
conse- quences of criminal conviction are especially
severe]{.underline}. Whereas the [consequences]{.underline} of civil
litigation are financial in nature, the consequences of criminal
litigation [can be death]{.underline}, 4 1 [prison]{.underline},4 2
[probation]{.underline}, 4 3 [fines]{.underline},44 [loss of
status]{.underline}, moral [condemnation, and social
stigma]{.underline}.45 Throughout the history of common and civil law,
severe and sometimes draconian penalties have been imposed on those
found guilty.46 Courts have recognized that criminal convictions entail
especially serious consequences. As Justice Brennan wrote, \"\[t\]he
[accused]{.underline} during a criminal prosecu- tion has at stake
[interests of immense importance]{.underline}, both [because of the
possibility that he may **lose his liberty** upon conviction and because
of the certainty that he would be **stigmatized** by the
conviction]{.underline}.\" 47 In his concurrence in the same case
Justice Harlan reiterated the severe consequences in terms of loss of
liberty and stigmatism associated with a criminal conviction. 48
[Because the consequences are so severe, wrongful convictions must be
limited even if they cannot be eliminated]{.underline}. \"Given the
limits of investigatory techniques and human knowledge, a system that
convicts only the guilty is generally acknowledged to be impossible.\"
49 No system is perfect, and that includes the system that provides
trials to criminal defendants in the United States. Aside from the
challenges inherent in developing a uniform definition of \"reasonable
doubt,\" police officers, prosecutors, judges, witnesses, defense
lawyers, and jurors make mistakes. The innocent will sometimes be
convicted.50 [The presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt both serve to maintain a balance that favors
wrongful acquittals over wrongful]{.underline}
[convictions]{.underline}. James Whitman argues that the real purpose of
the proof-beyond-a-reasonable- doubt requirement is otherwise. He
suggests the standard was developed to protect the conscience and souls
of those called upon to judge the defendant.5 1 The book marshals
historical support for the conclusion that the reasonable doubt standard
\"was not originally designed to make it more difficult for jurors to
convict. It was designed to make conviction easier, by assuring jurors
that their souls were safe if they voted to condemn the accused.\" 5 2
Putting aside the question of original intent behind the development of
the standard, however, it remains the case that a reasonable doubt
standard (along with a presumption of innocence) has the effect of
protecting against wrongful convic- tions at the expense of foregoing
some number of rightful convictions.5 3 This is the dominant view
espoused by courts, and Whitman agrees, noting that the mecha- nisms for
providing moral comfort to finders of fact will often coincide with
those for raising the bar against conviction.54 Whether one is concerned
about the direct consequences for the defendant or the spiritual or
emotional consequences for the juror or judge, the severity of the
consequence for the defendant is a sufficient reason to avoid wrongful
convictions. B. [Plea Bargaining Undermines the PrimaryLegal Mechanisms
for Preventing Conviction of the Innocent]{.underline} [Where trials are
avoided, the standard of proof required]{.underline} for a conviction
[can be reduced to mere probable cause]{.underline}. Probable cause is
[the standard required to initiate charges]{.underline}.55 Where the
government has: (a) probable cause to bring a series of charges with
significantly disparate penalties, and (b) discretion to select among
those charges, 56 then the effective burden of proof to secure a
conviction can be reduced to as little as probable cause. This problem
is best illustrated without accounting for the very real complexi- ties
introduced by cognitive bias and lack of information. Such complexities
are the basis for Bibas\' assertion that plea bargaining does not really
happen \"in the shadow of trial.\"5 7 A simplified example-presented
very much in the shadow of trial-demonstrates that [even a purely
rational innocent defendant may elect to plead guilty]{.underline}, and
that [the effective standard of proof for securing this plea will be
mere probable cause]{.underline}. [Introducing real-world
biases]{.underline} ([such as over-discounting future utility) and
real-world limitations (such as lack of information or resources) would
significantly complicate the example]{.underline}. As a result of such
complexities, some defendants would be more likely than the rational
defendant to accept a deal; others would be less likely to do so. 58 The
point remains, however, that [[plea bargaining asks defendants to
decide]{.mark} whether to plead guilty based [on factors]{.mark} largely
[**unrelated** to]{.mark} actual [guilt]{.mark}.]{.underline}59 Consider
a hypothetical in which the quantum of evidence against the defendant is
such that the innocent defendant assesses the risk of conviction as
twenty percent.60 The defendant faces thirty years in prison if
convicted after trial and has an offer of four years if she pleads
guilty. Discounting the thirty-year sentence by the anticipated
eighty-percent chance that it would not result if the defendant opted
for trial (30\*0.2) nets a pre-trial estimate of the value of trial to
be a six-year sentence. 61 Even assuming-in another simplification
62-that the defendant val- ues her liberty consistently over time (i.e.,
without a value-reduction for liberty benefits accruing further in the
future), a rational defendant would accept this offer without regard for
her guilt or innocence. Anytime the calculus generates a result where a
rational defendant will plead guilty, the effective burden of proof to
achieve that result is probable cause (assuming the defendant is
rational). To be clear, this is not an abstract concern. A four-year
offer on charges that could net thirty years after trial may seem
unrealistic. It is not. Such a skew is dramatic, but in federal criminal
practice it is neither unusual nor new. 63 For example, in a case
involving illegal possession of a firearm and possession with intent to
distribute a controlled substance, a federal prosecutor might offer a
plea to the status offense of being a felon-in-possession of a
firearm,64 while threatening to charge carrying a firearm in furtherance
of a drug trafficking crime65 if the defendant seeks a trial. 66

A. Defendant Losses 1. Understanding How much do defendants who do not
speak for themselves understand the legal process? 175 The legal system
has long grappled with the concern that defendants, particularly those
with educational or cognitive deficits, may not understand what is
happening to them. 17 6 As studies of medical consent demonstrate, even
when tech- nical concepts are explained to them, laypeople often do not
under- stand the language being used or remember what they are told. 1
77 [[Silent defendants]{.mark} are even more prone to misunderstandings
because their [ignorance is **rarely revealed**]{.mark}]{.underline},
either to the court or often even to their own lawyer. [For the
under-educated, often functionally illiterate defendant population,
[silence may]{.mark} thus both [**mask** and **contribute** to
incomprehension]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Silence]{.mark} [can]{.mark}
also [cause **cognitive**]{.mark}
**[disengagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[Defendants]{.mark} who are
[not expected to speak]{.mark} or testify during motions, hearings, or
trials may **[stop listening]{.mark}**, especially when the language
used is legalistic or technical]{.underline}.1 78 [[Silent defendants
are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[less likely to grasp]{.mark} the [con-
cepts]{.mark}]{.underline} that govern their case [because [they]{.mark}
[never have to]{.mark} [reproduce them out loud]{.mark}]{.underline}.
179 [[Counsel]{.underline}]{.mark} likewise [[are under **little
pressure**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [their [clients]{.mark} [understand]{.mark}]{.underline}
[anything]{.underline} more than the basic precepts [because
defendants]{.underline} (and therefore counsel) [are]{.underline}
**[never tested]{.underline}**. While defense counsel will usually ask
questions to determine whether their clients understand key concepts,
much of what goes on in a case or in court will never be explicitly
discussed. 180 [[Silence]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[reinforces]{.mark}
defendants\' **[psychological distance]{.mark}** from court
proceedings]{.underline}. [[Silence is]{.mark} a form of **[acquiescence
to authority]{.mark}**, a way of [**admitting incomprehension** and the
**inability to contest**]{.mark} what is being said]{.underline}. In her
study of Baltimore rent court, Barbara Bezdek con- cluded that
[[tenants\']{.mark} in-court silence both [reflected]{.mark} and
reinforced their perception that [they were **powerless** and]{.mark}
that [their legal fate was **predetermined**]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 8 \'
Psychologists have noted that [silent litigants]{.underline} who do not

and that [[the inability to]{.mark} [participate verbally in]{.mark}
their own legal proceedings [is]{.mark} itself a species of
**[discrimination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 182 While the
[incomprehension]{.underline} that accompanies forced silence
[is]{.underline} a [well-recognized]{.underline} phenomenon [for non-
English-speaking]{.underline} litigants,18 3 [it is a **danger** for

III\. PLEA BARGAINS , WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS , AND THE PROBABLE C AUSE S
TANDARD At the time of this writing there are 1886 exonerees listed in
the National Registry of Exoneration database, spanning from 1989 to
2016.53 Of particular interest to this article is the number of wrongful
convictions generated as a result of the guilty plea. From 1989 to 2016
there have been a total of 276 identified cases of wrongful conviction
where the accused accepted a guilty plea but was later determined to be
innocent.54 That amounts to a little more than fifteen-percent of the
total number of identified wrongful convictions. Among those states that
make use of grand jury indictments as their principal charging
instrument, there are 180 exonerees who originally entered guilty
pleas.55 Table 2,56 provided below, culls data from the National
Registry to illustrate the following three data points: (1) states that
make use of grand jury indictments as their principal charging
instrument, (2) the number of exonerees who entered into guilty pleas,
and (3) the total number of exonerations from each of the grand jury
states. Since 1989, twenty-six grand jury states collectively convicted
180 innocent people via the plea, about twenty percent of the total 895
wrongful convictions.57 I present this particular plea exoneration data
to emphasize one significant point: in 180 cases (twenty percent of the
total), innocent people were presented with an indictment following
presentment before a grand jury where the standard of proof was probable
cause. All of these 180 people accepted the terms of a guilty plea.58 I
have argued elsewhere that guilty pleas give rise to a significant
number of wrongful convictions.59 Legal and social science scholars
simply do not have access to the kind of data necessary to determine
which among the felony plea convictions, comprising of 95 to 97 percent
of all felony convictions, are cases where the defendant is innocent.
The National Registry data presents us only with cases that have been
identified as wrongful convictions, but surely there are more. A host of
[[legal]{.mark} **[fictions]{.mark}** have been constructed to
[rationalize the constitutionality of]{.mark} conviction by way of [plea
bargain]{.mark}]{.underline}. Surely, some reading this article will
object to my juxtaposition of trial with plea convictions as being a
comparison of apples to oranges. In fact, those critics would be
correct. In the United States, we have established two distinct
mechanisms for criminal conviction: a trial that affords the accused
their constitutionally mandated due process protections, and plea
bargaining which occurs in the privacy of the prosecutor's office.60 It
is important to note the temporal aspect of the plea process. Legal
scholars will often contend that pleas are constitutional, and that the
accused relinquishes her right to the presumption of innocence upon
admission or confession to the charges.61 However, my concern, and the
substance of this article, is temporally sensitive. What I am addressing
is the legal process that unfolds for an accused between the time of the
defendant's arrest and her grand jury indictment. Once the indictment is
procured, the prosecutor may advance toward negotiation of a plea. This
article contends that the unconstitutionality of the plea process
commences prior to the admission or confession where guilt is affirmed
at the plea colloquy. It seems clear that it is [the confluence of
police investigation activities, pre-sentencing reports, case law,
courtroom working groups, and neurophenomenological
characteristics]{.underline}62 [of the accused (occurring upon arrest
and ending with grand jury indictment]{.underline}), that [directly
implicate police officers, prosecutors, and defense attorneys in an
unconstitutional but immanently efficient practice of moving cases
toward rapid conviction]{.underline} It is my contention that the
confluence of the following factors all but assure innocent men and
women will be wrongfully convicted via the plea: (1) [[The low standard
of proof]{.mark} [necessary to indict]{.mark} (probable
cause]{.underline}); (2) [T[he absence of a pre-trial presumption of
innocence]{.mark}]{.underline}; (3) [The fact that [prosecutors are not
bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence]{.mark}---there is no evidentiary
requirement that the state presents exculpatory evidence]{.underline};
(4) [[The absence of adversarial due process]{.mark};]{.underline} (5)
[The fact that a prosecutor may convene as many grand juries as is
necessary to procure an indictment]{.underline}; (6) The fact that
[[neurophenomenological]{.mark} [factors]{.mark} heavily influence the
plea bargaining process]{.underline};63 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (7)
[The prevalence of [Draconian]{.mark} state and federal [sentencing
statutes]{.mark} that are used by prosecutors]{.underline} and defense
attorneys [to encourage resolution of cases via the plea]{.underline}
Equally important to the legitimacy of a democracy, as the Supreme Court
recognized in Winship, is [the "moral force of the criminal law" that
must not be "diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt
whether innocent men are being condemned]{.underline}."64 In Table 2,
data is culled from the National Registry of Exonerations pertaining to
exonerations occurring since 1989 in grand jury states There are
countless activities that people and institutions engage in because it
is what they have always done. In fact, in many ways what constitutes
being human is our frequently inconsiderate return to habitual pathways
regardless of whether they pertain to a morning commute to work,
conversations with family, friends, and colleagues, or conventions
relating to the way we eat and dress. [[When]{.mark} those [habits rise
to the level]{.mark} [of bureaucratic procedure]{.mark}, as in criminal
due process, [they]{.mark} may [take on]{.mark} [**superstructural**
hegemonic significance]{.mark}, ultimately [manifesting as
legal-rational mechanisms for the reproduction of state
power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Such is the case with our
contemporary reliance upon the probable cause standard of proof as it
applies to the presentation of charges, at information hearings, or
before a grand jury. [[It is doubtful]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[prosecutors]{.underline}]{.mark}, defense attorneys, or judges [stop
to [question the bureaucratic]{.mark} [significance
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the probable cause standard, especially as it
applies to the standard necessary for obtaining an indictment at
information or grand jury proceedings. Indeed, the standard is so
ubiquitous and steeped in over fifty years of practice applied to [[plea
bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [it]{.underline} has [[attained
hegemonic status]{.underline}]{.mark}. The probable cause standard for
indictment is taken for granted by everyone who occupies the courtroom
working group. Like the presumption of innocence, the probable cause
standard is so ubiquitous that [merely questioning the
prudence]{.underline} of the standard of proof as it pertains to
criminal charges before a grand jury, for instance, [generates a
**quizzical** look akin to questioning whether the sun rises in the
east]{.underline}. [The practical application of the probable cause
standard of proof required for indictment, a standard that has existed
for over one-hundred years]{.underline},67 [has taken on an
**essentialist** quality]{.underline} that through its proliferation
over time, has developed a deeply worn channel. The question then
becomes[: Is it true that just because we have been operating on the
premise that the probable cause standard is hegemonic, must it
necessarily be so]{.underline}? In an article published in March of 2016
by the Stanford Law Review, Professor William Ortman provides a thorough
historical assessment of the origins and applications of probable cause
both in England and the United States.68 Professor Ortman's article
provides a thorough account of the origin and evolution of probable
cause, something that this article will not entirely repeat here.
However, it will reveal some prescient insights as they may prove to be
important in assisting my claims. As already considered, [[the standard
of proof]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} procedural mechanism
[to ensure fairness]{.mark}. If there were no charging standards, a
prosecutor could bring a case before a grand jury with illegitimate
evidence, or even no evidence whatsoever]{.underline}. Ortman contends
that, "[charging standards act as a constraint on
prosecutors]{.underline}."69 Accordingly, "[\[t\]he more one ratchets up
a charging standard. . . the more confident one can be that prosecutors
are constrained and that convicted defendants are actually
guilty]{.underline}."70 The probable cause standard was known to
American judges and attorneys at the time of our nation's founding
primarily through English "Whig tracts, legal treatises, and justice of
the peace manuals."71 It appears that disputes arising between Whigs and
Tories are what generated intense focus on whether one could be charged
and indicted before a grand jury based upon "probabilities."72 The grand
jury in England originated with the creation of the Assize of Clarendon
in 1166 by Henry II,73 but little attention is given to charging
standards until Edward Coke and Matthew Hale comment on them in the mid-
seventeenth century.

#### The trial penalty is coercive and causes innocent convictions. Lawyer polls and studies prove

Testimony for False Pleas," American University Law Review,

As Chief Justice John Roberts acknowledged in Lee v. United States,78
defendants are motivated by different "determinative issue\[s\]," such
as immigration consequences, when making plea decisions.79 The legal
community knows from both individual examples and laboratory evidence
that these motivations can compel even an innocent person to plead
guilty, which accounts for the criminal justice system's high rate of
pleas. One of the most significant factors leading to a guilty plea is
the sentencing benefit offered in return for giving up the right to
trial by jury. In a study where adult and juvenile offenders in New York
were interviewed, researchers discovered that adult defendants received
an eighty percent average reduction of the anticipated sentence that
would result from trial.80 The discount for pleading guilty for
juveniles was even larger, at ninety-five percent.81 In another study
examining plea discounts in Pennsylvania, researchers found that
sentences were fifty-seven percent longer for those convicted at
trial.82 And yet another study, focusing on all federal criminal cases
from 2006 to 2008, found that [those who exercised their right to
[trial]{.mark} received [sentences]{.mark} that [were **sixty-four
percent**]{.mark} longer than similarly situated individuals who
pleaded]{.underline} [guilty]{.underline} prior to trial.83 Other
research indicates that [conviction by a [jury]{.mark} not only
[increases the]{.mark} length of sentences, conviction at trial also
increases the [likelihood]{.mark} [of]{.mark} being sentenced to
[incarceration]{.mark}]{.underline}. One analysis by the Vera Institute
of Justice in 2020 found that [the odds of incarceration were [**2.7
times** higher]{.mark} for those who exercised their right to trial and
that the [sentences]{.mark} of these individuals [were **fifty-seven**
percent]{.mark} [longer]{.mark} than the sentences of those accepted
guilty pleas]{.underline}.84 Another study of federal sentencing
practices released in 2019 demonstrated that defendants convicted at
trial faced a two to six times greater likelihood of being
incarcerated.85 [[Given]{.mark} these [discount rates for pleading
guilty]{.mark}, it is little wonder why defendants, including [innocent
defendants]{.mark}, often [plead guilty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In one
study that examined adults and juveniles, a belief that one was
receiving a "deal" was one of the most often cited reasons for accepting
a plea bargain.86 Data also indicates that [[the better the
"deal]{.mark}," and [the higher the benefit]{.mark} from accepting the
plea offer, [the more likely a defendant is to
accept]{.mark}]{.underline}.87 When [[prosecutors]{.underline}]{.mark}
charge defendants with statutes carrying mandatory minimum sentences,
they can [**[leverage]{.mark}** these [extreme potential penalties to
encourage]{.mark} [defendants to take a]{.mark} favorable [deal]{.mark}
on the table]{.underline}.88 Mary Price, General Counsel of FAMM, said
in a 2019 piece, "\[[m\]andatory minimums are essential to the trial
penalty]{.underline}."89 The certainty of mandatory minimums means that
defendants are not forced to guess at the benefits of pleading guilty.
Another example of the power of sentencing differentials and the gap
between the pre-trial offer and potential post-trial sentence in leading
a defendant to plead guilty is the case of Chris Ochoa, who falsely
pleaded guilty to rape and murder in Texas in 1989.90 After his plea,
Mr. Ochoa was sentenced to life in prison.91 Thirteen years later, in
2002, DNA evidence exonerated him.92 In Mr. Ochoa's case, he was
threatened with the death penalty if he did not plead guilty.93 His
attorney had encouraged him to accept the plea offer, but he maintained
his innocence and refused.94 It was only after his mother became ill
from the stress of the case and asked him to accept the offer that he
relented.95 Mr. Ochoa's case not only reflects the significance of
sentencing differentials in leading defendants to plead guilty, but the
matter illustrates the important role that counsel may play in
encouraging this behavior. And yet, the Supreme Court has made clear
that it believes that the presence of counsel is the very thing that
will prevent an innocent person from falsely pleading guilty.96 Research
from the last decade, however, indicates that this assumption regarding
the protections afforded by counsel in plea decision-making was also in
error. In a 2020 article by Diamond and Salerno, the researchers, in
collaboration with the American Bar Association Commission on the
American Jury, examined reasons for the disappearing trial.97 The study
conducted interviews with judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel and
concluded that [defense counsel played a significant role in encouraging
defendants to take pleas.]{.underline}98 The report noted that [counsel
were recommending pleas, in part, because of overwhelming caseloads and
limited resources]{.underline}.99 Diamond and Salerno also found that
other factors that lawyers consider when encouraging their clients to
take pleas are the imposition of mandatory minimum statutes and
increased sentences after conviction at trial.100 Contrary to the
Supreme Court's assumption that the role of counsel safeguards against
false pleas, research also indicates that [counsel can have a
significant role in increasing, not decreasing, the likelihood of false
guilty pleas by the innocent]{.underline}. In a study from 2018
regarding attorney perceptions of guilty pleas, the authors interviewed
counsel in nine U.S. states (New York, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming,
Vermont, Idaho, Iowa, Arizona, and Rhode Island).101 [Roughly
[**seventy-eight** percent]{.mark} of those asked [indicated]{.mark}
that [there were]{.mark} **definitely** [cases]{.mark} in the current
system [where an innocent]{.mark} individual [should plead
guilty]{.mark}]{.underline}.102 "[[When asked]{.mark} [whether they
had]{.mark} ever [been involved]{.mark} in a case where a client chose
to plead guilty despite maintaining their innocence]{.underline},"
almost [**[ninety percent]{.underline}** [said
yes]{.underline}]{.mark}.103 Not only were the attorneys aware of this
occurring, [almost [**forty-five percent** admitted to having advised
clients they believed were innocent to accept a]{.mark} favorable
[plea]{.mark} [agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}.104 In fact,
[[even]{.mark} in cases [where]{.mark} the defense attorney felt [there
was less than a **fifty percent** chance of conviction]{.mark}, [a
significant proportion]{.mark} [stated they]{.mark} would
[recommend]{.mark} to an innocent client to [plead]{.mark}
guilty]{.underline}.105 Again, as identified by Diamond and Salerno,
several factors lead to this behavior, including severe sentences after
trial and plea offers being beneficial.106 Henderson and Levett
published a study using the cheating paradigm applied to students by
Dervan and Edkins in their 2013 study.107 This time, however, the study
protocol was modified to include testing the influence of advocate
participation during the decision-making process.108 Where no advocate
participated, the study participants falsely pleaded guilty thirty-five
percent of the time.109 Where an advocate participated and recommended
proceeding to trial, the false plea rate dropped to four percent.110 But
where an advocate participated and provided only educational information
regarding the available options, forty-seven percent of the study
participants went on to falsely plead guilty.111 This represented a
twelve percent increase in the false plea rate compared to scenarios in
which there was no advocate present.112 More strikingly, where an
advocate participated and recommended pleading guilty, fifty-eight
percent of the study participants went on to falsely plead guilty.113
This plea rate is sixty-six percent higher than that found when there
was no advisor at all.114 Other studies have identified the likelihood
of an even more pronounced impact of counsel recommendations on
juveniles, where they are particularly susceptible to influence.115
Contrary to earlier assumptions regarding the beneficial role of counsel
in preventing false guilty pleas, these findings demonstrate that the
presence of counsel likely exacerbates the false plea phenomenon.
Finally, not all defendants receive the same advice from counsel,
creating a situation in which the potential negative impacts of plea
advice from counsel are exacerbated for some and not others. First,
studies indicate that wealth impacts the representation and advice that
defendants receive.116 Defendants with public defenders, for example,
have been found to plead guilty at higher rates.117 The limited
resources available to underfunded public defense offices and, by
extension, the need to recommend guilty pleas more often to manage
burdensome dockets, may be contributing to this increased rate of
pleas.118 Second, the defendant's race influences the plea
recommendations of defense lawyers.119 In a 2011 study by Edkins,
defense counsel from multiple jurisdictions were asked to make
recommendations for defendants considering mock plea offers.120 The
study found that when the defendant was depicted as Black in the
hypothetical, defense counsel was more likely to recommend the defendant
take a plea and more likely to recommend a plea that included a
custodial sentence.121 Sentencing differentials and attorney advice to
clients are not the only significant influences for defendant-decision
making. Pretrial detention is another significant driver of pleas,
including false pleas.122 A 2018 study considered plea rates, innocence,
and pretrial detention through the use of various hypothetical
scenarios.123 Participants in the study were asked to review scenarios
involving a student charged with a drug offense, a nurse charged with
assault, and an unemployed individual living with two children in public
housing and charged with breaking and entering.124 Participants were
then asked to decide whether to accept a plea agreement or proceed to
trial.125 The results confirmed the validity of the legal community's
concerns regarding the impact of plea offers on both the accuracy of the
system and the free exercise of individuals' constitutional right to
trial.126 First, the study found participants assigned to both the
factually guilty and factually innocent conditions electing to plead
guilty, thus once again confirming the innocence phenomenon. . . .
\[Further\], the study found that pretrial detention significantly
influenced plea decisions. Of particular importance here, the rate of
innocent individuals who pleaded guilty tripled in the pretrial
scenarios.127 Other studies have found similar impacts from pre-trial
detention.128 In a Vera Institute report on plea bargaining, one study
cited in the report examined 76,000 arrests in Delaware.129 The study
determined that pretrial detention increased a person's likelihood of
pleading guilty by forty-six percent.130 Similarly, in a recent article
examining the results of five hundred interviews with public defenders,
the authors noted that extra-legal factors such as pre-trial detention
influenced counsel's recommendations regarding plea offers.131 Finally,
Leslie and Pope examined almost one million arraignments for felonies
and misdemeanors in New York City from 2009--2013.132 They found a link
between pretrial detention and increased plea rates.133 But the authors
also found that defendants detained pretrial were willing to plead to
worse offers.134 Further, the study demonstrated that many of the
individuals who pleaded guilty would have proceeded to trial had they
not been detained pretrial.135 Importantly, other research has shown
that people of color are more likely to receive larger bail amounts and
longer pretrial detention periods.136 Once again, therefore, the
influence of pre-trial detention is not just contributing to false
guilty pleas, but is likely leading to a disproportionate impact on
marginalized communities.137 Many factors may impact a defendant's
decision to plead guilty: assessments the likelihood of success at
trial,138 a desire for finality,139 the impact of collateral
consequences,140 risk aversion,141 temporal discounting,142 and familial
considerations,143 among others. However, as discussed above, the three
factors that appear most influential are sentencing differentials, the
advice of counsel, and pretrial detention.144 Certainly for Mr. Vasquez,
these influences contributed to his decision to falsely plead guilty, a
decision that had significant consequences not only for himself, but for
the others who became victims as a result. II. FALSE TESTIMONY IN RETURN

contendere]{.underline}]{.mark} 126 [[pleas]{.underline}]{.mark},
[prosecutors [**rarely** permit]{.mark} them]{.underline} [when
offering]{.underline} the defendant [a benefit]{.underline} in exchange
for a plea. A defendant has no right to get the benefit of a plea
agreement with the government and to enter an Alford or nolo contendere
plea.\'2 7 Plea agreements routinely require that the defendant both
advise the court that she is in fact guilty of the charges to which she
is pleading and affirm the truth of the government\'s statement of
facts. Even where there is no plea agreement, [the Department of Justice
strongly opposes Alford pleas]{.underline} 2 8 [and nolo contendere
pleas]{.underline}.I2 9 In federal court, it is a rare case in which a
defendant can earn the benefit of a plea agreement while refusing to
acknowledge factual guilt fully and completely. 3 0 Confessing is only a
problem where the confession is dishonest. Thus, [when the innocent
confess to secure the benefit of a plea bargain, there is a clear
problem.]{.underline} However, [a confession can be dishonest even where
it is accurate. For example, a defendant might have a good faith but
erroneous belief in her innocence]{.underline}. Such [a belief could be
the result of mistake, denial, diminished capacity at the time of
offense or the time of plea, or]{.underline} possibly [even uncertainty
or indeterminacy of the fact of guilt.]{.underline} Bibas suggests that
\"even a true but insincere confession is better than no confession at
all.\" 13 But [what should be made of the **untrue** and **insincere**
confession]{.underline}? One might argue that such confessions also
serve a purpose: a system that compels all who plead guilty to
acknowledge their guilt might protect itself to some degree from the
perception that it convicts innocent persons. This even could be seen as
a helpful step in avoiding the harm to the legitimacy of the system that
is inherent in treating all convictions alike132 ; [[by
demanding]{.mark} that all [defendants confirm their]{.mark} guilt, [the
legal]{.mark} system can [**pretend** the innocence problem does not
exist]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., the system would simply deny the
possibility that innocent defendants ever plead guilty). Unfortunately,
this suggestion is contrary to what we know. [[We know]{.mark} that
[innocent persons]{.mark} are [convicted]{.mark}, and we know that the
number of innocent persons convicted by a system [with plea bargaining
is **higher**]{.mark} than that by a system without the
practice]{.underline}. While the compelled statement of guilt may help
prevent the identification of individuals who believe in their innocence
(to some degree), it cannot alter the fact that [we know some higher
number of innocent individuals are convicted **systemically** as a
result of plea bargaining. [Requiring]{.mark} that [a]{.mark}
[defendant]{.mark} with a good-faith belief in her innocence
[confess]{.mark} in order to secure leniency is [at odds
with]{.mark}]{.underline} three of the [[factors]{.underline}]{.mark}
Tyler identified as serving [[to promote]{.mark} the procedural
[justice]{.mark} of a legal system]{.underline}: (1) it prevents the
defendant from **[[stating his case]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (2) it fails
to [treat the [defendant with]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[dignity]{.underline}**]{.mark}; and (3) from the defendant\'s
perspective, it [reflects poorly on the [character of]{.mark} the [legal
authorities]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 3 3 First, [[being compelled to state
something]{.mark} that the defendant be- lieves to be
**[untrue]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **much [worse]{.mark}** [than]{.mark}
merely [not]{.mark} being able to [tell one\'s
story]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is, to the defendant, [[the
system]{.mark} is [prevent]{.mark}ing [her]{.mark} from telling her
[story and **forcing her**]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} tell a
[**[lie]{.mark}** in its place]{.underline}. Second, [[few]{.mark}
[subjected]{.mark} [to]{.mark} such [coercion]{.mark} [would
feel]{.mark} that the compulsion to lie about one\'s own guilt is
consistent with being treated with [dignity]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
third, [[the person]{.mark} subject to this treatment [is unlikely to
feel]{.mark} that [it reflects positively]{.mark} on the character of
the legal authorities.]{.underline} Not all agree. Bibas has condoned
the use of \"external pressures, such as the threat of imprisonment,
\[to\] induce offenders to overcome their denial,\"1 3 4 suggesting that
\"\[a\]dmitting one\'s wrongdoing is the first step toward moving beyond
it.\"\' 3 5 But there are serious problems with this position. First, it
seems to ignore the fact that defendants believe in their own innocence
for reasons other than denial.\' 36 Some defendants are actually
innocent. It is difficult to see what good could possibly come of asking
the actually innocent defendant to lie in order to secure a lesser
sentence. Others may be mistaken or perceive uncertainty as to the key
issues. For example, a defendant charged with possession of a controlled
substance may erroneously believe he is innocent because he knows that
the narcotics did not belong to him and he fails to understand the legal
concept of joint, constructive possession. Or, the defendant may have
been intoxicated at the time of the offense or suffering from some other
form of diminished capacity, such that he erroneously believes in his
innocence. In a case in which the defendant maintains a good-faith
belief in his innocence, a confession induced by the promise of leniency
is unlikely to benefit the defendant or the legal system. . Even in the
case of denial, it is by no means clear that a coerced confession would
have any positive influence in overcoming the denial. Indeed, query
whether a system that compels a choice between lying (for, even the
defendant in denial, at the time she made the statement of guilt, would
be lying)13 7 and accepting additional punishment for a crime of which
the defendant believes herself innocent carries sufficient moral
authority with that defendant to overcome her denial. It seems at least
equally likely that [[the]{.mark} [defendant compelled to lie]{.mark}
about her guilt in order to receive a lesser punishment for a crime she
believes she did not commit [would be pressed]{.mark} further [into
**cynicism** and **denial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Bibas writes,
[\"\[**[p\]ublic confidence]{.mark}** and faith in the justice system
[are **essential** to]{.mark} the law\'s democratic [**legitimacy**,
**moral force**, and]{.mark} popular
**[obedience]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\" 138 [That [confidence cannot be
bolstered by]{.mark} **[compelled confessions]{.mark}** in cases of
wrongful convictions]{.underline}. Still, eliminating admissions during
guilty pleas represents a cost to those who place a normative or
instrumental value on confessions. However, the value of admissions
during guilty pleas can be vastly overstated. \"A rapist\'s denial means
that the victim was making up her accusation, or that she consented to
sex, or that she enjoyed being raped. The justice system must not put
its stamp of approval on these denials, because they victimize victims
all over again.\"\' 3 9 A rapist\'s denial means nothing of the sort. A
rapist\'s denial means that the rapist is denying the truth. On the
other hand, a defendant\'s denial means that the defendant is taking a
different position than the complaining witness. The difference turns on
whether we know the truth of the matter. My point should not be mistaken
for some sort of epistemological skepticism (e.g., can we ever really
know what happened?). My point is that we do know when we accept [a
bargained-for guilty plea]{.underline} that we have [applied a far less
rigorous method of factual proof than trial beyond a reasonable doubt;
we do know that by doing so we have increased the likelihood that
conviction will result without regard for actual innocence; we do
know]{.underline} that [we cannot be]{.underline} as
[confident]{.underline} in the outcome as we would had we not employed
the shortcut of a bargained-for plea. We have taken a shortcut as a
matter of practical necessity. [The shortcut comes at a cost in terms of
the certainty of result]{.underline}. No system demands or provides
absolute certainty of result; however, the practice of compensating
pleas produces more wrongful convictions than the practice of jury
trials at a reasonable-doubt standard. Compelling those defendants who
seek the benefit of the bargain to declare their factual guilt may cause
some defendants to balk at the deal. It will compel others to lie. As
hurtful as the defendant\'s denial may be to the alleged victim, the
solution is not to force a confession that purports more certainty than
merited by the circumstances giving rise to the conviction. [The harms
inherent in admissions required as a condition of leniency are well
illustrated by cases of compelled public apologies]{.underline}. In
recent years, the Department of Justice has turned to public apologies
in environmental cases as a means of both educating the public and
punishing the offender. Though creative and possibly effective, such
[public confessions carry costs similar to those associated with the
required admissions]{.underline}. Consider the case of Thomas Lukegord,
owner of a charter boat service operating out of Gloucester,
Massachusetts.140 On May 6, 2005, Lukegord towed the Nicole Renee, a
nineteen-year-old, sixty-two-foot wooden boat, to sea, intending to sink
it on Jeffrey\'s Ledge-thirty- three miles of rock ledge running
offshore from Massachusetts to Maine.\' 4\' He did this because on
numerous occasions the Nicole Renee sank at her mooring.142 The boat was
no longer sea-worthy. Lukegord estimated that paying for disposal of the
wrecked boat would cost over \$10,000.143 Disposing of the boat himself
would cost fuel for towing, in addition to his time. Prior to towing the
boat to sea, Lukegord emptied the Nicole Renee of fuel and oil. The
weather worsened as Lukegord left the harbor, and the Nicole Renee was
more difficult to tow than he anticipated.\'4 Unable to reach Jeffrey\'s
Ledge, he stopped in one hundred feet of water off Plum Island.1 4 5
There, he engaged the bilge pump to flood the vessel, causing it to sink
stern-first. 14 6 According to the Government, the sunken vessel posed a
navigational hazard to commercial fishing vessels that pulled nets
through the area.1 47 Lukegord pled guilty pursuant to an agreement
under which the government would recommend a sentence of one year
probation, a \$2,000 fine, \$1,928.96 in restitution, and publication of
a public apology at his own expense in the Gloucester Daily Times, the
New Bedford Standard-Times, and the National Fisherman.14\"The apologies
were to be printed on a full page in the New Bedford paper, and a half
page in the other two, with the total cost capped at \$6,000.149 The
apology was to read: \[i\]t\'s not worth it. I towed my fishing boat,
the Nicole Renee, offshore and I sank it. I didn\'t get the required
permit from EPA and I didn\'t tell the Coast Guard. I never meant to
harm anyone, but I now realize that my actions could have endangered
other fishermen. I agreed to pay for this notice so that other boat
owners might learn from my mistake. Unpermitted vessel sinking is a
crime. It can harm the environment and interfere with safe navigation.
Don\'t do it. It\'s not worth it. 15 0 While this public apology likely
served to educate the public about the state of the law, Mr. Lukegord no
longer stands by the statement. He recently told a newspaper reporter
that the prosecutor wrote the apology himself.15 \' He added his belief
that [the prosecutor \"uses the practice to advance his own career and
show off that \'he\'s got another notch on his gun]{.underline}.\"\"5 2
Lukegord\'s comments highlight challenges inherent in coerced
statements. [[People don\'t like]{.mark} [being compelled to]{.mark} say
something they believe to be untrue. It is one thing to be punished for
a crime; it is quite another to be forced to **[trumpet the
righteousness]{.mark}** [of the government]{.mark} that is [punishing
you]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The newspaper article suggested that
[Lukegord was \"**bitter**]{.underline}\" about the ad.153 His attorney
commented on defendants from whom apologies are compelled generally:
\"\'These people have families. They have kids who are in school \...
.\"\'154 In Lukegord\'s case, the government got the publicity it
sought. And, hopefully, others were educated as to the risks of
unpermitted vessel sinking. However, one could fairly question whether
compelling a public apology from the defendant was the best way to
achieve these ends, especially if the apology was not sincere. If the
report is correct, [Lukegord\'s perception of the procedural justice of
the legal system was undermined by the **compelled
speech**]{.underline}-that is, the case in which the defendant was
actually guilty.15 5 In a case in which the defendant believes herself
innocent-for whatever reason-the compelled admission is an additional
harm to the integrity of the legal system. Nor is this harm limited to
incidences of actual or perceived innocence. A defendant generally must
accept and affirm the prosecutor\'s version of events in order to secure
the benefit of the plea agreement; guilty defendants may be induced to
lie about specific aspects of the offense in order to appease the
prosecution. For example, a defendant might recognize her own guilt for
having dealt drugs or disagree with the government\'s assessment as to
the quantity of drugs she sold, yet nonetheless wish to accept a plea
offer. To do so, she would likely be required to make a statement about
the quantity of drugs she sold that she believes to be incorrect.
Whether the induced statement is about actual guilt or some specific
aspect of the offense, the harm caused by inducing a participant in the
legal system to make a statement that she believes to be false is real.
III. LIMITING THE HARM TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE SYSTEM CAUSED BY PLEA
BARGAINING

#### Plea bargaining's legal silencing of minority voices undermines dignity, legitimacy, and free speech rights, resulting in mass incarceration

Over [one **million** defendants]{.underline} pass through the criminal
justice system every year, yet [we]{.underline} almost [**never** hear
from them.]{.underline} [From the]{.underline} first Miranda warnings,
through trial or [[guilty plea]{.underline}]{.mark}, and finally at
sentencing, [most defendants **remain silent**]{.underline}. They are
spoken for by their lawyers or not at all. The criminal system treats
this perva- sive silencing as protective, a victory for defendants. This
Article argues that this [[silencing]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[a **massive democratic**]{.mark} and human
**[failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Our democracy [prizes]{.mark}
individual [speech as the **main antidote** to]{.mark} governmental
**[tyranny]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [yet it silences the **millions** of
poor, socially disadvantaged individuals who directly face the
**coercive** power of the state]{.underline}. [Speech]{.underline} also
[has important cognitive and **dignitary** functions]{.underline}: It is
through speech that [defendants engage with the law, understand it, and
express anger, remorse, and their acceptance or rejection of the
criminal justice process]{.underline}. [Since defendants speak so
rarely]{.underline}, however, these [speech functions]{.underline} too
often [go]{.underline} [unfulfilled]{.underline}. Finally, [[silencing
**excludes** defendants from]{.mark} the **[social narratives]{.mark}**
that shape the criminal justice system itself,]{.underline} in which
society ultimately decides which collective decisions are fair and who
should be punished. This Article describes the silencing phenomenon in
practice and in doctrine, and identifies the many unrecog- nized harms
that silence causes to individual defendants, to the effectiveness of
the criminal justice system, and to the democratic values that underlie
the process. It concludes that defendant silencing should be understood
and addressed in the con- text of broader inquiries into the
(non)adversarialand (un)democraticfeatures of our criminal justice
system. [The constitutional right of free expression is **powerful
medicine**]{.underline} in a society as diverse and populous as ours.
[It]{.underline} is designed and intended to [remove governmental
restraints from the arena of public discus- sion]{.underline},
[putting]{.underline} the decision as to [what views shall be
voiced]{.underline} largely [in]{.underline}to [the hands]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} each of us, in the hope that use of such freedom will
ultimately produce a more [capable citizenry]{.underline} and more
perfect polity and in the belief that [no other approach would comport
with the premise of individual dignity]{.underline} and choice upon
which our polit- ical system rests. -Justice Harlan, Cohen v.
California1 The United States\'s criminal justice system is shaped by a
funda- mental absence: Criminal defendants rarely speak. From the first
Miranda warnings through trial until sentencing, defendants are con-
stantly encouraged to be quiet and to let their lawyers do the talking.
And most do. Over **[[ninety-five percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[**[never go to trial]{.mark}**,]{.underline} 2 only half of those who
do testify, 3 and some defendants do not even speak at their own
sentencings. As a result, in millions of criminal cases often involving
hours of verbal negotiations and dozens of pages of tran- scripts, the
typical defendant may say almost nothing to anyone but his or her own
attorney. Courts and scholars typically treat this silencing as a
victory for defendants. In our adversarial system, the right to remain
silent and its Siamese twin, the right to have counsel speak on one\'s
behalf, are necessary to permit the defendant to challenge the
government\'s case, primarily because the government has the burden of
proof and defen- dant speech is potentially incriminating. Silence is
also one of the principal protective devices standing between defendants
and an increasingly unsympathetic criminal justice system in which high
con- viction rates and heavy punishments make defendant speech risky. 4
The right to remain silent is thus \"the essential mainstay of our
adver- sary system.\"\'5 It also reflects the overwhelmingly
instrumental out- look of modern criminal practice in which defendant
entitlements are evaluated almost exclusively in terms of their ability
to help defen- dants evade punishment. 6 [Defendant speech]{.underline},
however, [has personal, dignitary, and demo- cratic import beyond its
instrumental role within the criminal case]{.underline}. From an
individual perspective, [[silent]{.mark} [defendants]{.mark} [are
denied]{.mark} many of the cognitive and participatory benefits of
[expressive engagement]{.mark} in their own cases]{.underline}. After
all, [it is [through speech]{.mark} that [defendants enter]{.mark} into
a relationship with [the law]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Through speech
[they]{.mark} [attain]{.mark} and express their [understanding]{.mark}
or misunderstanding [of]{.mark} legal [dictates]{.mark}]{.underline},
[their [views on]{.mark} the [fairness]{.mark} or unfairness of the
procedures by which they are adjudicated, [and]{.mark}]{.underline},
ultimately, [[their acceptance]{.mark} or rejection [of the]{.mark}
process and its [outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Defendants who
remain]{.underline} [silent]{.underline} throughout the legal process
[are less likely to understand their own cases, engage the]{.underline}
dictates of the [law intellectually]{.underline}, [accept the legiti-
macy of the outcomes, feel remorse, or change as a result of the
experience]{.underline}. 7 [[Defendant silence]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[has **systemic implications** for]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[integrity]{.underline}]{.mark} of the justice process. In our
democracy, [individual speech has histori- cally been seen as an
**antidote** to governmental overreaching]{.underline}. 8 [Crim- inal
defendant speech is]{.underline} perhaps [the **quintessential example**
of the individual defending his]{.underline} or her [life and liberty
against the state]{.underline}. 9 Yet [silent defendants rarely express
themselves directly to the government official deciding their
fate]{.underline}, be it judge or prosecutor, [and]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} often [punished more harshly when they
do.]{.underline} The justice system assumes that conversations between
counsel and clients, and counsel\'s own speech on behalf of clients,
fulfill the personal needs of defendants as well as systemic
requirements that defendants be \"heard.\" Yet most defense counsel are
overworked, appointed counsel with insufficient time to spend
communicating with their clients or fully exploring their clients\'
personal stories. 10 More generally, [[speech is]{.mark} the
**[constitutionally celebrated]{.mark}** vehicle by which [defendants
have their \"**day in court**]{.mark},\" [enforce]{.mark}]{.underline}
or waive [[their]{.mark} constitutional [rights]{.mark}, [tell
their]{.mark} [stories to the **jury**]{.mark}]{.underline}, persuade
the judge of proper punishment, and communicate with their
constitutionally guar- anteed counsel. [The fact]{.underline} that
[defendants speak rarely]{.underline} or not at all [means]{.underline}
that [these democratic speech functions often go
unfulfilled]{.underline}. [[Silenced defendants]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[excluded]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the larger institu- tional and [[social
discourses]{.mark} that control their fates]{.underline} within the
justice system. 1 Since defendants speak for themselves so infrequently,
[[judges, prosecutors, and lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[**[never]{.underline}** [hear from]{.underline}
[them]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [the democratic processes]{.underline}
that generate our justice system [proceed without those
voices]{.underline}. This process failure [reinforces the **social** and
**psychological** **gaps** between defendants and those who adjudicate
them]{.underline}. Above and beyond the discourses that take place
within legal institutions, [defendants are excluded from broader social
narratives that give meaning to systemic precepts such as fairness,
deterrence, and punishment]{.underline}. [Because they do not speak for
themselves]{.underline} in court, and, as \"[criminals,\" are disfavored
speakers]{.underline} outside the legal process, [defendant voices
are]{.underline} by and large [missing from the criminal justice
discourse]{.underline}. [[Defendant silence]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
extends beyond the courtroom. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} part of a
larger phenomenon of [**[expressive]{.underline}**
**[disempowerment]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [those [dis-
advantaged]{.mark} [groups]{.mark}]{.underline} [who tend to become
defendants: racial minorities, the poor, the undereducated or
illiterate, juveniles, the unemployed, or people with criminal
histories, mental health or substance abuse problems]{.underline}. 12 A
now-familiar literature explicates the **[legal]{.underline}**
**[silencing]{.underline}** of subordinated groups: poor people, women,
people of color, non- English-speakers, juveniles, and others. 13 At the
center of this litera- ture lies the recognition that legal structures
and norms [contribute to]{.underline} such [groups being
silenced]{.underline}, and that [[being]{.underline} [heard within the
legal pro- cess can be]{.underline}]{.mark} [an **[important]{.mark}**
[part of]{.mark} a larger [**power** **struggle** over social
meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 Criminal defendants belong in this
silencing literature. Not only are they silenced by their typical status
as impoverished, young, undereducated people of color, 15 but they are
additionally silenced by constitutional doctrines, criminal rules, and
their attor- neys. Although the plight of criminal defendants as legal
speakers has generally evaded this type of analysis16-and the
adversarial system creates unique demands discussed below-defendant
silencing should nevertheless be understood as part of a larger,
well-documented struggle over narrative social power. This Article
focuses primarily on the plight of this most disadvan- taged class of
defendants. In addition to their socioeconomic and edu- cational
disadvantages, these defendants suffer an additional silencing set back:
They are represented by public defenders or low-paid attor- neys who
lack resources to investigate and litigate each case to its ful- lest,
or sometimes at all. 17 Some of this Article\'s conclusions therefore
may not apply with equal force to those represented by well- resourced
private or other counsel who have the time to develop a robust
communicative relationship with defendants. Wealthy defen- dants also
have greater speech opportunities outside the courtroom and therefore
their silence within the legal system may not resonate with other
silencing experiences in the same ways.18 I thus focus on disadvantaged
defendants both because they constitute approximately eighty percent of
the defendant population, 19 and because they are most likely to suffer
the sorts of socioeconomic and personal handi- caps that make expression
and representation difficult. Accordingly, their expressive experiences
are both typical and tell us the most about the flaws in the system. Not
only does defendant silence raise troubling issues of social exclusion
and dignitary harm, but the phenomenon itself largely escapes notice.
Defendant self-expression receives practically no legal attention: The
most highly developed area of law and scholarship in this regard takes
the negative form of a jurisprudence of silence which asks only when
defendants may not be forced to speak. 20 But [the right to remain
silent implicates at best a small subset of expressive issues. It cannot
fully account for the]{.underline} expressive experiences and [needs of
society\'s most disadvantaged]{.underline} [speakers]{.underline} as
they are investi- gated, prosecuted, and brought before our nation\'s
official tribunals. This Article is first and foremost a diagnostic
project. It describes the phenomenon of defendant silence, identifies
its sources in practice and doctrine, and explores its symptoms,
including its negative impact on principles of expressive dignity,
democratic responsiveness, and social empowerment. This Article is also
prescriptive in that it argues that we should attribute more positive
value to defendant speech, even as it acknowledges the tension between
the normative assertion that defendant speech is valuable, and the
reality that criminal defen- dants can be significantly harmed by their
own words. The \"cure\" for defendant silencing therefore cannot lie
simply in more speech, or giving defendants further opportunities to
incriminate themselves. Because defendant silence is integral to the
criminal justice system, any attempt to \"turn up the volume\" must
contend with the system\'s larger commitment to an adversarial,
representative process in which defendants who speak are severely
punished and have their stories demeaned. In effect, the phenomenon of
defendant silence represents the clash of two sets of values. The first
set is instrumental: those values that protect defendants against
incriminating evidence in litigation. The second set of values is both
personal and social, centering on defendants\' expressive, dignitary,
and participatory needs. The argu- ment here is not that the latter
trumps the former. Rather, it is two- fold. First, this Article argues
that notwithstanding the obvious instrumental value of silence, [the
criminal justice discourse has ignored]{.underline} the latter set of
**[dignitary values]{.underline}**, an omission this Article tries to
remedy. Second, it argues that any balancing decisions between the two
sets of values must take place within the larger conversation about the
criminal justice system in which traditional models and assumptions are
being challenged and rethought. [With]{.underline} the demise of the
adversarial model, 2 1 the dominance of plea bargaining, 22 [the
**explosion** in the criminal justice population]{.underline} 23 [and
its prevalence in poor communities of color, and]{.underline} greater
attention being paid to the role of [[the criminal industrial
complex]{.underline}]{.mark} within the body politic and the economy, 24
our understanding of our justice system is changing. This Article thus
offers a richer description of defendant silence in order to situate it
within these broader debates over the true nature of the criminal
system. Ultimately, evaluating defendant silence-and making decisions
about which procedural protections are appro- priate-must take place
within this larger effort to discern the extent to which our massive
modern criminal justice system is fair and democratic. Part I describes
the twin engines of defendant silence: the prac- tical mechanics of
criminal cases, and the rules governing speech and silence. First, this
Part describes the pervasive fact of silence in the criminal justice
system and how the everyday procedures and prac- tices of litigation
consistently ensure that defendants say little or nothing. The Part then
discusses at some length the silencing role of counsel and the
constraints on the attorney-client conversation. I argue that counsel is
best understood as a functionary of the adver- sarial system and its
institutional predilection for silence. This system thus limits the
ability of individual attorneys to overcome the silencing pressures
stemming from their own roles. Part II constructs a jurisprudence of
defendant speech as a way of understanding how existing constitutional
rights and criminal rules, taken together, define, restrain, and
undervalue criminal defendant speech. This jurisprudence is conflicted:
It contains robust theoretical commitments to defendant expressive
freedom that are constantly subsumed by instrumental demands for
defendant silence. Notwith- standing the fact that First Amendment
doctrines rarely apply to crim- inal adjudication, this Part also
explores the relevance of free speech values and principles to the
criminal process. With its attentiveness to the role of speech in
democratic governance and institutional integ- rity, free speech
scholarship offers new ways to appreciate the value of defendant speech.
Part III hypothesizes some of the non-jurisprudential effects and costs
of the silencing phenomenon. [These include cognitive costs to
defendants who do not participate expressively in their own cases, the
institutional loss of information about defendant perceptions and
experiences that might enable the judicial and political spheres to
respond better to those who populate the criminal justice system, the
erosion of normative principles of human dignity and participation, and,
finally, the near total exclusion of defendants from the national
dialogue on criminal justice.]{.underline} The criminal system is
undergoing reevaluation on several fronts: the erosion of adversarial
ideals, the dominance of plea bargaining, the unprecedented level of
incarceration and harshness of punish- ment, and the recognition that
crime control is becoming a dominant governance mechanism. The Article
concludes that, [for this [reevalua- tion]{.mark} to be complete, it
[needs to engage]{.mark} the phenomenon of [defendant
silence]{.mark}]{.underline}. I THE PERVASIVENESS OF DEFENDANT SILENCE

II SILENCE Is GOLDEN: THE JURISPRUDENCE OF DEFENDANT SPEECH Analyzing
legal practices and participation as forms of speech has become a
fertile scholarly field. 84 The legal system is a creature of language,
and participation in that system necessarily takes place through verbal
and written speech, rendering all litigants in some essential sense
\"speakers.\" [Conceptualizing legal actors as speakers highlights the
idea that [speaking]{.mark} can [have value in]{.mark} and of itself-in
terms of [**self-expression**, **recognition**, and
**participation**]{.mark}]{.underline}-[above and [beyond the
content]{.mark} or instrumental effect [of]{.mark} the [words]{.mark}
themselves.]{.underline} This framework also reveals the ways in which
\"speakerhood\" plays an important role in the law. For criminal
defendants, this speakerhood framework is espe- cially fertile.
[[Defendants\']{.mark} speech has unique constitutional signifi- cance:
They [have the **right to**]{.mark}]{.underline} remain silent, to
[[**testify** at trial, and to represent
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. As part of their right to counsel,
[they]{.underline} also [have the right actually to communicate with
that lawyer]{.underline}. 85 [[Defendant]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[speech]{.underline}]{.mark} also has democratic significance: It [is
the **weapon** with which defendants [**protect** themselves
against]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [executive branch]{.mark} and sup- plicate
the judiciary]{.underline}. [Defendant]{.underline} [speech]{.underline}
thus [plays a **central** role in]{.underline} many [**foundational**
aspects of the criminal justice system]{.underline} itself. Although
neither criminal procedure nor [**[First]{.mark}**
**[Amendment]{.mark}**]{.underline} doc- trine expressly conceptualizes
criminal defendants as speakers, taken together these [doctrines
[constitute]{.mark} a de facto [jurisprudence]{.mark} [that **cele-
brates**]{.mark} defendant speech and personal
[expression]{.mark}]{.underline} in theory, but serves in practice as a
powerful engine of silence. Fifth and Sixth Amend- ment doctrines
contain significant theoretical commitments to defen- dant expressive
choice and dignity, but in operation they inevitably succumb to the
instrumental pressure in favor of silence. While First Amendment
jurisprudence and scholarship offer little direct protec- tion to
defendants, free speech discourse concerns itself with many values and
questions centrally implicated by defendant speech, the main one being
the question of whether a criminal justice system that never hears from
its subjects is democratically legitimate. 6 Reconceptualizing
defendants as speakers is not just a way of reorganizing existing
doctrine; it offers an alternative to the dominant instrumental model
that treats defendant speech, indeed all defendant rights, as valuable
primarily insofar as it reduces the likelihood of pun- ishment. 87 [The
speakerhood model recognizes]{.underline} additional [values such as the
defendant\'s personal dignity and choice, democratic participa- tion,
expressive freedom, and the ability to be heard]{.underline}-values that
are sacrificed when defendants remain silent. [The speakerhood
model]{.underline} thus [permits a more accurate evaluation]{.underline}
[of [the]{.mark} true **[costs of silence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an
evaluation of particular importance in a system [[in]{.mark} which
[**ninety-five percent** of defendants]{.mark} will [never go to
trial]{.mark}]{.underline} or actually exercise many of their
constitutional rights. The speakerhood model also brackets questions of
individual guilt or innocence. 88 [The question of whether defendants\'
speech is exculpatory or factually true does not answer the]{.underline}
broader [question of whether they are worth hearing from]{.underline}.
89 The [speakerhood]{.underline} framework thus [gives weight to **all**
defendant speech]{.underline}, perhaps especially that of those who
plead guilty since they constitute the bulk of the criminal defendant
population 90 and also represent that class of defendants least likely
to be listened to. A. Defendant Expressive Rights [The
**[Fifth]{.mark}** **[Amendment]{.mark}**]{.underline} privilege against
self-incrimination, often referred to as \"the right to remain silent,\"
is a vast doctrinal creature generating volumes of analysis and dispute.
It is not my purpose to try to reduce it to a unitary theory. Rather,
the contention here is that we can fairly read the privilege as
[conferring value on defendant expressive freedom. It [gives]{.mark}
independent, [dignitary value]{.mark} **[both]{.mark}** [to
speech]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to the very act of choosing whether or [not
to speak]{.mark} at all.]{.underline} In particular, [[it recognizes the
**central** role of speech]{.underline}]{.mark} [within the crim- inal
case and [the defendant\'s right to shape his legal destiny with his
**own words**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This recognition is reflected in
those doctrinal areas pro- tecting a defendant\'s right to testify at
trial, and to proceed without counsel, in which the **Fifth and Sixth
Amendments** together directly protect the defendant\'s right to
speak]{.underline}. In these senses, [[the]{.mark} \"[right to remain
silent]{.mark}]{.underline}\" [is a **misnomer**]{.underline}: The
privilege [[protects]{.mark}, not the right to remain silent, but rather
[the right to make]{.mark} [autonomous]{.mark} expressive [decisions
about]{.mark} [whether]{.mark} or not [to speak]{.mark}]{.underline}.
91 1. Miranda: The Suspect as Subjugated Storyteller In establishing the
classic contours of the right to remain silent, the Miranda Court was
centrally concerned with defendant expressive liberty. [The protections
of counsel and warnings]{.underline}, explained the Court, \"[enable the
defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances to tell his story
**without fear**]{.underline} \.... \"92 The evil of interrogation is
that it \"subjugate\[s\] the individual to the will of his examiner, \'9
3 \"is\... destructive of human dignity,\"\'94 and prevents defendant
speech that is \"truly \... the product of his free choice.\" 95 The
privilege also reflects the proper relationship between the state and
individual expression: \"\[T\]he privilege against
self-incrimination-the essential mainstay of our adversary system-is
founded on a complex of values. All these policies point to one
overriding thought: the constitutional foundation underlying the
privilege is the respect a government \... must accord to the dignity
and integrity of its citizens. \'96 At bottom [the privilege is not
about silence but expressive choice]{.underline}: \"\[T\]he privi- lege
is fulfilled only when the person is guaranteed the right \'to remain
silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own
will.\' 97 \"Our aim,\" concluded the Court, \"is to assure that the
individual\'s right to choose between silence and speech remains
unfettered throughout the interrogation process. \'98 Some scholars have
also placed expressive choice at the heart of the privilege. In his
historical analysis, William Stuntz described the definitional Fifth
Amendment cases of Miranda and Massiah as pro- tecting defendant choice:
The privilege protected the defendant\'s pri- vate information \"unless
the defendant chose-really chose-to give it up.\" 99 Christopher
Slobogin has likewise described the array of due process, Fifth and
Sixth Amendment privileges as reflecting a \"deep and universal
commitment to voice,\"\' 10 0 focusing on the notion that the
[privileges value speech and expression and not merely
silence]{.underline}.\' 0 \' [The testimonial component]{.underline} of
the privilege reflects even more specific expressive concerns. It
**[protects]{.underline}** [a suspect\'s \"communica- tions,\" even
where the information contained in those communica- tions is not itself
protected and may be obtained by other means]{.underline}. 102 \"It is
the extortion of information from the accused,\... the attempt to force
him \'to disclose the contents of his own mind,\' \... involving \[the
accused\'s\] consciousness . . .and the operations of his mind\" that
trigger the privilege. 10 3 It is precisely its ability to reveal
thought- processes that makes testimonial speech expressive and makes
its pro- tection integral to defendants\' dignity and autonomy as free,
willing speakers. 2. The Defendant\'s Right to Speak [The
Constitution]{.underline} also [confers upon defendants affirmative
rights to speak: the right to testify, to allocute at sentencing, and
the right to represent oneself]{.underline}. These expressive privileges
flow from a combina- tion of principles: the Fifth Amendment right to
remain silent and various aspects of the Sixth Amendment including the
right to put on witnesses in defense. [The **right to testify** is
perhaps the defendant\'s most obviously expressive
entitlement]{.underline}. [[The Court]{.mark} has **[repeatedly
affirmed]{.mark}** that [**every** defendant has the]{.mark} [right to
tell his story]{.mark} in his own way]{.underline}. 10 4 [The right
flows [from]{.mark} three constitutional provisions: **[due
process]{.mark}**, [the]{.mark} [**Sixth** **Amendment**]{.mark}**\'s**
Compulsory Process Clause, [and the **Fifth Amendment**]{.mark} right to
remain silent]{.underline}. Each of these constitutional components con-
tains an expressive element. \"\[[D\]ue process of law include\[s\] **a
right to be heard**\" and the defendant\'s right to \"choose between
silence and testifying in his own behalf]{.underline}. \' 10 5 [The
Sixth Amendment\'s]{.underline} right to call witnesses [includes \"an
accused\'s right to present his own version of events in his own
words]{.underline}.\" 10 6 Finally, [[the right to remain silent
implies]{.mark} [a]{.mark} correlative **[right to
speak]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 10 7 Defendants also have the right to
speak at sentencing, although this expressive entitlement appears to
rest more on the rules of crim- inal procedure than the Constitution.
Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the
defendant has the right to allocute,10 8 and numerous courts have
remanded for resentencing when it appears that defendants were not given
the opportunity to speak. 10 9 As a constitutional matter, the Supreme
Court has held that the Fifth Amendment applies at sentencing and that
therefore a defendant\'s silence at sentencing cannot be held against
him. 110 Like- wise, the Court has implied that, under the Fifth
Amendment, a defendant cannot be precluded from allocuting.\"\' Finally,
the Court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of
counsel includes the correlative right to self-representa- tion, which
the Court has specifically recognized as an expressive enti- tlement to
individual voice: \"[A defendant\'s right to self-
representation]{.underline} plainly [encompasses]{.underline} certain
specific rights to have his voice heard.\"\' 2 It is [a right to a
strong, individuated voice]{.underline}: \"\[T\][he right to speak for
oneself entails more than the opportunity to add one\'s voice to a
cacophony of others]{.underline} \... [a defendant may legitimately be
concerned that multiple voices for the defense will confuse the message
the defendant wishes to convey]{.underline} \.... ,,113 This right to
voice, moreover, has an illustrious pedigree. In tracing the history of
self- representation, the Court noted the longstanding common law pre-
sumption that [a fair trial included the defendant\'s right to \"conduct
his own cause in his own words]{.underline}. 1\" 4 Even after the
emergence of the right to counsel, \"[the accused retained his
established right \'to make what statements he liked]{.underline}.\"\"\'
5 In these senses, [the right to self-repre- sentation is the
**quintessential**, non-instrumental expressive right]{.underline}.
[[The defendant has the]{.mark} [right to]{.mark} control both the
[speech]{.mark} that constitutes his own case and the voice in which it
takes place, [even to the detriment of his legal
success]{.mark}.]{.underline} In sum, [the right to remain silent, the
right to testify, the right to self-representation]{.underline}, and
their rationales add [up to a]{.underline} broad [expressive
commitment]{.underline}. [Defendants have the constitutional right to
choose whether to speak or to remain silent]{.underline}, and ultimately
to control the messages sent by their own criminal defenses.
[[This]{.mark} expressive [privi- lege recognizes the **inherent value**
in]{.mark} [speakerhood]{.mark} [and its **intimate** connection
to]{.mark} personal autonomy, dignity, and [democratic]{.mark} par-
ticipatory [values]{.mark}]{.underline}. B.Doctrinal Silencing

The historical shift away from expressive concerns also manifests itself
in the operation of the privileges themselves. The pivotal point at
which the right to remain silent transitions into a silencing mecha-
nism is when the right to counsel attaches, after a defendant is for-
mally charged. 1 19 At that point, the privilege against self-
incrimination shifts from the protection of the defendant\'s autonomy
against government coercion (a scenario in which a defendant might
choose to speak) to a strong bias against uncounseled speech. A
defendant\'s invocation of his right to counsel receives more solicitous
treatment than his invocation of his right to remain silent. 120 After
the right to counsel has attached, even voluntary speech by defendants
made without counsel\'s sanction is inadmissible, if \"deliberately
elic- ited\" by the government. 121 A charged defendant\'s waiver of the
right to remain silent is presumed invalid absent strong evidence that
the defendant does not wish counsel to be present. 122 In this scheme,
it is counsel, not the defendant\'s personal right to remain silent,
which is treated as protecting defendants most vigorously.
[[Plea]{.underline} [doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark} likewise [[reflects
the]{.mark} [**devaluation** of defendant expression by tolerating
**coerced speech**]{.mark} as long as it is counseled]{.underline}.
[[Threats of death]{.underline}]{.mark}, prison, prosecution of family
members, promises of leniency, and even cash 123
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[permissible]{.underline}]{.mark}
bargaining tools for the prosecution in its effort [to **induce** the
defendant to say what the state wishes him to say and to waive his
constitutional rights, including the right to speak at
trial]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} its leading case on the topic,
[the]{.underline} [Court]{.underline} rejected the notion that such
inducements are coercive, relying on the presence and advice of counsel
to ensure that a defendant\'s decision to plead guilty is rational and
voluntary. 124 In other words, [[a defen- dant can]{.mark} agree to
[plead guilty]{.mark} [out of **fear for his life**]{.mark} or his
family as long as he has a lawyer]{.underline}, and his decision to do
so will be deemed voluntary [[even if the]{.underline}
[defendant\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} subjective [[feel]{.mark}ing is that
[he has **no choice**]{.mark} **at all**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline} **[impoverished]{.underline}**]{.mark} notion of
[[voluntariness]{.underline}]{.mark} contrasts with the more robust and
nuanced expressive concerns of Miranda and Faretta discussed above.125
Or, as Albert Alschuler put it over twenty years ago, \"\[t\]he practice
of plea bargaining [[is **inconsistent**]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
principle]{.underline} that a decent [[society should]{.mark} want to
[hear]{.mark} what [an accused person]{.mark} might say in his
defense]{.underline}.\' 12 6 This jurisprudential shift is part of a
larger analytic transition in the criminal process in which
representation by counsel becomes a proxy for defendant autonomy. After
counsel is appointed, the avail- ability of the privilege no longer
turns on Miranda-type concerns: whether the defendant actually feels
coerced or free. Instead, the assumption is that as a represented
litigant, a defendant\'s expressive and autonomy needs are fulfilled by
having a lawyer present and it is counseled speech, not voluntary
speech, which the constitutional rules aim to produce. Counseled speech
is actually presumed to be volun- tary and informed, even absent
evidence that the defendant in fact understood or was specifically told
of all his rights by counsel. 127 The role of defendant speech in the
law shifts accordingly: Instead of speech being the vehicle by which a
defendant expresses himself, it becomes the thing that the lawyer does
for him. The onset of repre- sentation is actually a moment of
silencing, all the more so because, as described above, the
attorney-client conversation often cannot do the expressive,
communicative work assigned it by the Court. 128 1. Erosions of Specific
Speech Rights As noted above, the Supreme Court has held that the
necessary corollary of the right to remain silent is the right to speak.
But the Court\'s protection of the defendant\'s right to speak is
markedly weaker than its protection of the right to remain silent. A
defendant may never even be informed by the court of his right to
testify at his own trial: The \"silent record rule\" holds that a
defendant\'s failure to testify or object to the lack of opportunity
will be deemed a waiver of the right. 129 By contrast, Miranda requires
that defendants be warned even before they are charged with a crime of
their right to remain silent, and the court will inform them on the
record of this right.1 30 Similarly, the failure to allow a defendant to
allocute at his own sen- tencing is not per se constitutional error,\' 3
\' while his right to remain silent at sentencing is constitutionally
protected. The Court\'s treatment of the right to self-representation
reflects a similarly weakened commitment to defendant\'s expressive
rights, flowing again from the Court\'s heavy reliance on defense
counsel. Soon after Faretta132 declared the defendant\'s right to
proceed pro se in order to tell his own story, the Court modified its
approach to the right to self-representation in McKaskle,133 affirming
the court\'s authority to appoint stand-by counsel and stand-by
counsel\'s authority to speak for the defendant to the court and the
jury, notwithstanding the defendant\'s opposition to counsel\'s
participation. 1 34 The McKaskle Court held that as long as the
defendant retained \"actual control over the case,\"\' 135 presenting
the essence of the case to the jury the way he wanted, stand-by
counsel\'s speech did not infringe the defendant\'s right to control his
own case. In particular, the Court was concerned about the lower
court\'s ability to use stand-by counsel for its own convenience, to
create a mouthpiece for the defendant, against his wishes, who could
better address the rules and procedures to ease the process of trial.
136 In that sense, [[the defendant\'s expressive rights]{.mark} [were
**trumped** by the court\'s desire to hear the case in a
convenient]{.mark} and familiar [manner]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
stand-by counsel\'s need to usurp the defen- dant\'s speech when
necessary to do her job. In sum, despite significant expressive
underpinnings, defendant\'s speech rights do not function in practice as
expressive entitlements but primarily as silencing ones, limitations on
the speech that the gov- ernment can extract rather than an affirmation
of the dignitary rights of defendants. [The Court has given shorter
shrift to the right to speak-making it easy to waive and hard to
enforce]{.underline}-than its rhetoric about the importance of speech
would seem to predict. This de- emphasis of defendant speech flows from
the Court\'s reliance on counsel: Once represented, the defendant\'s
personal expressive needs disappear, jurisprudentially speaking. The
Court\'s jurisprudence thus contributes to [a criminal justice process
that devalues defendant speech rights and is in tension with the
Court\'s broader commitments to expressive autonomy and
dignity]{.underline}. C. First Amendment Values in the Criminal Context
Nearly all the ways that defendants speak in court are heavily regulated
and potential ly punishable without raising First Amend- ment claims.
The rules of evidence and procedure strictly limit court- room speech.
137 Defendants who speak disrespectfully to the court or address the
jury directly may be held in contempt. 138 [[The government can
**burden**]{.mark} [the defendant\'s right]{.mark} to go to trial and
testify [by]{.mark} **[threat- ening]{.mark}** [him with additional
counts and longer sentences]{.mark}]{.underline}. 139 A defen- dant who
speaks angrily or without remorse at a sentencing hearing may be put in
prison for additional years. Even the rare defendant who openly
criticizes the nature of the proceeding-thus engaging in classic
political speech-has limited protection.1 40 In any event, polit- ical
protest-type \"high speech\" is not directly implicated by the vast
majority of routine expressive activity that occurs in court during
testi- mony, plea colloquies, and sentencing.141 The bulk of criminal
defen- dant speech thus takes place in ways that do not trigger First
Amendment protections at all. Likewise, courts and scholars do not
assess defendant speech through the broader political or expressive
prism of First Amendment values. 142 This inattention can be seen as a
species of what Frederick Schauer calls the \"invisible,\"
\"camouflaged\" boundaries of First Amendment doctrine-the fact that
[[during the criminal process]{.mark} \"[the **First Amendment**]{.mark}
just [does not show up]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"\'1 4 3 More concretely,
[there is heavy [pressure]{.mark} to [treat defendant]{.mark}
[speech]{.mark} instrumentally as part of the criminal process,
[relevant only to]{.mark} its impact on [defendant liability]{.mark} and
punishment, [and not to]{.mark} [external]{.mark} non-adjudicative
[values]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The fact that [his \"free speech\" can
cost a defendant **years in prison**]{.mark}]{.underline} tends to
[[push]{.underline}]{.mark} non-instrumental [[**dignitary** concerns
about **speakerhood** into obscurity]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 4 4 This
section maintains that [defendant speech has non-instru- mental,
democratic, expressive value]{.underline} of the sort commonly
[associated with the First Amendment]{.underline}. This is not a
positive law claim about the contours of actual First Amendment
doctrine, but rather a more gen- eral exploration of how we value speech
and expression in other gov- ernmental and social arenas, and how those
values and concerns are triggered when defendants are silenced. [Free
speech concerns are]{.underline} triggered [in the]{.underline}
[courtroom because that is where]{.underline} [defendants]{.underline}
directly [address the government and the public, where the public and
media have the right to hear them]{.underline}, 145 [and
where]{.underline} the official process of [adju- dication takes
place.]{.underline} Free speech concerns are also implicated more
broadly by defendant [silence]{.underline} because the criminal justice
system-its value judgments and its place within the political economy-is
[deprived]{.underline} of [the challenges that defendant voices might
pose]{.underline}. This latter concern is of particular significance
because defendants\' silence is exacerbated by their social status:
Defendants constitute a signifi- cant segment of poor communities of
color 14 6 for whom the criminal justice system is a dominant
governmental presence and for whom the lack of speech opportunities
represents an additional democratic and dignitary loss. 1. First

1\. First Amendment Values The First Amendment triggers deep inquiries
about the value of speech in our constitutional democracy. It has become
an umbrella for wide-ranging debates over the meaning of truth and
democracy, equality and tolerance, as well as the proper relationship
between gov- ernment and individual. The two classic themes discussed
below-the marketplace of ideas and the role of free speech in
self-governance- illustrate how criminal defendants\' speech implicates
some of the values typically associated with free speech ideals. 147 a.
The Marketplace of Ideas Justice Holmes famously wrote of the First
Amendment that \"the ultimate good desired is better reached by free
trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of the thought
to get itself accepted in the competition of the market. \' 148 These
words have generally been interpreted to mean that [[free speech]{.mark}
plays an **important** role in [permit]{.mark}ting [social truths to
emerge]{.mark}, and that [silencing voices]{.mark} within that
\"marketplace\" **[impedes]{.mark}** [rigorous inquiry into
truth]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 9 By exten- sion, [when viewpoints are
excluded from the public debate, [it **under- mines confidence** in the
conclusions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Criminal defendants are **excluded**
from the \"marketplace of ideas]{.underline}\" [that shapes the criminal
justice system]{.underline}. Spoken for and about by lawyers,
criminologists, legislators, and law enforcement, [defen- dants rarely
share their own views on the criminal process:]{.underline} Is it fair?
Does it deter? Does it seem cruel or lenient? Legitimate or over-
bearing? Rational or random? [At no point during the criminal pro- cess
itself can defendants safely share their thoughts]{.underline} on these
matters, and afterwards, in prison or on release, the opportunities to
speak are even more scarce. 150 From a market viewpoint, this loss of
voice is significant. There is increasing evidence that [[innocent
defendants are not heard in their own cases, resulting in **wrongful
convictions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.15 1 From a more systemic
perspective, [[defendants are **experts**]{.mark} in the system, [with
**unique exper- iences** that]{.mark} could **[cast light]{.mark}** on
the central]{.underline} efficiencies and [inefficiencies of the
criminal process, as well]{.underline} [as]{.underline} its various
claims to [fairness]{.underline}. Indeed, [defendants are the **subjects
of the system**]{.underline} itself: Laws and punishments are aimed
centrally at their minds and behaviors. If defendants are ignorant of
the law and their obligations, it may mean [that the system does not
convey its message well]{.underline}. 152 If defendants experience the
legal process as unfair, overbearing, and unresponsive, it suggests that
some of [the promises of due process and the Bill of Rights have gone
unfulfilled]{.underline}. 153 If defendants feel guilty and remorseful
about their criminal behavior, perhaps the criminal law reflects
generally shared norms and values. 154 [Without hearing from
defendants]{.underline} in their own voices, however, [it\'s hard to say
whether]{.underline} any of [these things are true]{.underline}. For
these reasons, a marketplace of ideas that does not include defendant
voices is an impoverished one whose out- comes and conclusions are
suspect. b. Democratic Self-Governance Another classic theme
[[paint]{.mark}s]{.underline} [[free speech]{.underline} [as
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[prerequisite]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [participatory [democracy]{.mark} and
**self-governance**]{.underline}, [[necessary to]{.mark} any system that
rests on [the \"**consent of the governed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 155
The Court has held variously that [democratic [self-governance
**requires**]{.mark} \"free political dis- cussion]{.underline} [to the
end]{.underline} that [[government]{.mark} may be [responsive to
the]{.mark} **[will of the people]{.mark}**]{.underline},\"1156 that
[free speech is the \"**guardian of our democracy**]{.underline},\"1 15
7 and that the First Amendment was designed to \"ensure that the indi-
vidual citizen can effectively participate in and contribute to our
republican system of self-government.\' \' 158 Scholars have likewise
described the [First Amendment as intended \"to make the public debate
sufficiently rich to permit true collective self-determina-
tion]{.underline}, \' 159 to preserve responsible and regulated
discussion, 160 [and]{.underline} as necessary to \"best [promote
democratic deliberation]{.underline}. \' 161 Others adopt a more
individualistic and participatory focus, [treat]{.underline}ing [free
speech as a way of preserving the individual right to participate in and
shape the public debate]{.underline}. 162 In each version,
[[free]{.underline} [speech]{.underline}]{.mark}[\'s crucial function is
to [**legitimate** the political]{.mark} [process]{.mark}
and]{.underline} thereby [its outcomes]{.underline}. Defendant silence
engages the question central to these approaches to free speech: whether
the democratic debate over the state\'s power to punish can proceed
without hearing from those who are punished. Or, put another way, is our
criminal justice apparatus legitimate from a participatory, political
responsiveness perspective? The democratic decisional process that
creates criminal laws, mandatory minimum sentences, sentencing
guidelines, felon disen- franchisement laws, and registration
requirements-in other words, [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[punishments]{.underline}]{.mark} and burdens [imposed on criminal
defendants- [takes place]{.mark} [without hearing from
defendants]{.mark}]{.underline} who are in the process of being
[[subjected to those]{.mark} very [laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. Once
convicted and incarcerated, defendants continue their exclusion from the
public debate. Their silence begins in prison, 163 and continues upon
release, not least because of felony disenfranchisement laws and
defendants\' inability to hold public office. Defendants do not even
have good proxy speakers: Their actual representatives-their
attorneys-are constrained by the exigencies of litigation and sworn to
secrecy. Moreover, there are very few interest groups who speak for
defendants within the political process. 164 [Since First Amendment
self-governance theory holds that the political process derives its
legitimacy from the opportunity for expressive participation,
[defendants\' lack of]{.mark} parliamentary [floor
time]{.mark}]{.underline} 165 [[renders their
treatment]{.underline}]{.mark} by the criminal system **[deeply
[suspect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This problem becomes more poignant when
[[defendants]{.mark} [comprise]{.mark} a large percentage of poor
**[communities of color]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What Jonathan Simon
refers to as \"[governing through crime]{.underline}\" 166
[and]{.underline} David Garland describes more generally as a
\"**[culture of control]{.underline}**,\' 67 [points]{.underline} to the
fact [that the criminal system is a]{.underline}
**[dominant]{.underline}** form [of governance in poor black
neighborhoods]{.underline}. In communities where **[fifty
percent]{.underline}** [or more of the men are under criminal justice
supervision at any given time]{.underline}, [where the odds that a black
man will be arrested in his lifetime are **one in three**]{.underline},
[and where **thirteen percent** of the men are disen-
franchised]{.underline}, [the [criminal]{.mark} system is the
government]{.underline}. 168 The central fact about this
[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, is that it
[[is]{.underline} [**coercive** and **punitive**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
However, [its [failings are **exacerbated**]{.mark} by the fact that
[it]{.mark} actively **[silences its constituents]{.mark}**, [cutting
off]{.mark} traditional [avenues for]{.mark} democratic [change
and]{.mark} practically [ensuring]{.mark} official
**[unresponsiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. c. Subordinated Speakers The
silencing of criminal defendants is an example of the phe- nomenon that
seemingly neutral principles of free speech can actually silence
disempowered speakers. 169 Discourse-the way things are talked about-is
an exercise in power. In this case, criminal justice discourse shapes
the identity and fate of defendants. 170 Defendants are thus silenced
twice, first by the adversarial process, but also by their status as
overwhelmingly low income, predominantly minority, undereducated
\"criminals.\" Defendants as a class are among those least likely to be
heard by judges, legislators, and the public. In other words, they are
the least likely to have authentic \"free speech\" oppor- tunities.
Moreover, the \"speech\" doctrines of criminal procedure are
specifically designed to ensure their silence and to empower others to
speak for them. The fact that criminal procedure doctrine and
scholarship ignore the harm of silencing-even treat it as a favor to
defendants-only exacerbates the problem. Or, as Catharine MacKinnon put
it elsewhere: Both \[First Amendment and Equal Protection law\] show
virtually total insensitivity to the damage done to social equality by
expres- sive means and a substantial lack of recognition that some
people get a lot more speech than others. In the absence of these
recogni- tions, the power of those who have speech has become more and
more exclusive, coercive, and violent as it has become more and more
legally protected. Understanding that there is a relationship between
these two issues-the less speech you have, the more the speech of those
who have it keeps you unequal; the more the speech of the dominant is
protected, the more dominant they become and the less the subordinated
are heard from-is virtually nonexistent. 171 Defendant silence thus
skews the scholarly debate. First Amend- ment discourse does not grapple
with the special problems posed by criminal defendant speech, and
criminal procedure\'s jurisprudence of silence is barren of the sorts of
concerns and pressures that First Amendment questions exert in other
arenas. As a result, we lack even the vocabulary to describe the \"free
speech\" concerns that arise when a defendant feels official pressure to
keep silent about his own fate in the face of government prosecution.
172 2. Reevaluating Defendant Speech Ultimately, the problem revealed
here is that defendant speech is undervalued, treated narrowly as a
Fifth Amendment problem instead of broadly as a First Amendment
opportunity. The cure is not to extend First Amendment protection to
everything a defendant says. Rather, it is to [start valuing defendant
speech]{.underline}.\' 7 3 This brief discussion suggests new ways to
attribute familiar, positive values to defendant speech. Likewise, the
previous discussion of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments reveals existing
[doctrinal foundations that place high importance on defendant
expression and choice, the very same \"pre- mise of **individual
dignity** and choice upon which our political system rests\" and which
the First Amendment also protects]{.underline}. 174 These existing tools
offer ways both to appreciate defendant speech for its potential
democratic and social contributions, and to identify the significant
losses that accompany defendant silence. III FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF
DEFENDANT SILENCE To this point, this Article has examined defendant
silence prima- rily by reference to existing jurisprudential norms, as a
way of high- lighting the costs of defendant silence for which we
already have legal labels and frameworks. Widespread defendant silence
implicates core concerns of First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment
jurisprudence and scholarship, undermining personal expressive freedom
within the legal system, reducing democratic participation, and impeding
responsive government. But defendant silence involves additional costs
beyond these jurisprudential harms. This Part inquires into these costs,
which emerge from a richer inquiry into the role that speech plays in
indi- vidual consciousness, legal practices and institutions, and, more
broadly, in constituting the discourses that shape the legal system and
our understanding of it.

3\. Perceptions of Legitimacy [When the law does not hear]{.underline}
or recognize individuals\' [speech]{.underline}, [it undermines the
**legitimacy** of]{.underline} [the legal process]{.underline} for those
silenced indi- viduals. [People who are not heard, who feel
**unrecognized** and **unac- knowledged**]{.underline} during the legal
process, [are less likely to accept its outcomes or consider
them]{.underline} to be [fair]{.underline}. For example, as Bezdek
described Baltimore\'s silent rent-court litigants, [their decision not
to speak]{.underline} in court [reflected]{.underline} in part [their
belief]{.underline} \"that [the outcome was **pre-
determined**]{.underline}, i.e., that rent collection through rent court
was another set of rules in which [others have all the
say-so]{.underline}.\"\'1 96 Similarly, William O\'Barr and John Conley
concluded that [liti- gants who are silenced by formal legal procedures
experience less per- sonal satisfaction with the legal
process]{.underline} [than]{.underline} small-claims [participants who
are permitted to speak in their own voices]{.underline}. 197 [Formal
constraints led to \"**frustration** and
**dissatisfaction**]{.underline},\" and some litigants reported that
\"they never would have taken their cases to court or agreed to testify
if they had realized ahead of time how little opportunity they would
have to tell their stories. \' 198 While criminal defendants are in a
significantly different posture than civil [litigants]{.underline},
presumably they [experience]{.underline} similar
**[distrust]{.underline}** [of a legal process that does not hear their
voices]{.underline}.199 By contrast, [studies of litigant
satisfaction]{.underline} with restorative justice programs [suggest
higher offender satisfaction with]{.underline} the
[expressive]{.underline} [opportunities]{.underline} in these programs
[than]{.underline} with those afforded by tradi- tional adversarial
[court]{.underline} sentencing [proceedings]{.underline}. 20 0 The
example should not be strained. Restorative justice programs, such as
victim- offender mediations in which victims and offenders negotiate a
resolu- tion through a mediation process, involve a great deal more than
mere defendant/offender speech, and they typically address punishment
alone: Liability is usually already determined.2 0 \' Nevertheless, it
is worth noting that [offenders]{.underline} who participated in the
studies [were]{.underline} explicitly [asked whether they \"had an
opportunity to tell their story]{.underline}\" 20 2 and whether \"their
opinion was adequately considered. 20 3 For both questions, [the
restorative justice programs scored **signifi- cantly better** than the
court proceedings]{.underline}. 20 4 None of these examples contradicts
the bedrock importance of the right to remain silent in protecting the
typical defendant from self- incrimination. In the United States,
restorative justice programs are still \"embryonic \' 20 5 and
complementary to the adversarial process: They typically do not
adjudicate contested issues of liability, and are often limited to
juvenile offenders. 20 6 The open nature of restorative proceedings,
moreover, permits different sorts of inquiries: For obvious reasons we
lack data on defendant satisfaction with the ability to withhold
inculpatory evidence from the police and the court. But these examples
nevertheless indicate that, at the very least, in our system where the
vast majority of defendants admit guilt, more atten- tion needs to be
paid to defendant perceptions of the legitimacy of the process by which
their stories are heard and their punishments determined. B. Systemic
Harms 1. Institutional Ignorance [If defendants]{.underline} could
[speak more freely]{.underline}, what might we learn? First, [we might
learn]{.underline} what defendants know about their obligations under
the law and potential punishments. While ignorance is no excuse under
the law, we could better determine what deters and what does not, and
under what circumstances legal rules function well. Judges and
prosecutors would learn about the social circum- stances that breed
crime and violence from the perspectives of those who must survive under
them. They might also learn some of the rea- sons why people commit
crimes in high-crime neighborhoods, why heroin addicts rob banks, or why
juveniles steal cars. 20 7 Legislators could better probe the elusive
relationships between poverty, dignity, and criminality. The system
would also obtain [more information about law enforcement and how police
behave, in ways that suppres- sion hearings rarely permit because
defendants face incrimination if they take the stand]{.underline}. 20 8
[Every aspect of criminal justice]{.underline}, in other words, [could
be evaluated in light of its]{.underline} actual [effects on its
intended]{.underline} targets. Instead, the adversarial system makes
silence the safest, most protective option for a defendant. As a result,
the criminal system never gets to know defendants-their voices,
identities, motivations, or experiences. The only institutional actors
who do-defense counsel-are overworked and sworn to secrecy. If the
system was intended to keep society substantially clueless about the
people it incarcerates, it could not have been better designed.
Defendant silence thus maintains the ignorance of institutional players
such as judges and prosecutors who never hear the full story about the
individuals before them, or indeed about the functioning of the justice
system itself.20 9 There are remarkably few alternative sources of
information. For judges, defense counsel are expected to fill in the
narrative gaps about their clients, although, as described above, this
is a highly artificial, constrained account. Judges are also expected to
have some institutional memory about the conditions that affect
defendants, but since they rarely hear from a defendant in his own
voice, their worldview is necessarily limited. This information deficit
often occurs, moreover, in the context of existing judicial bias and
hostility. Recent studies indicate pervasive racial and economic
discrimination in sentencing, particularly at the federal level, in
which unemployed black and Hispanic youth receive heavier sentences than
other defendants with similar criminal histo- ries. 210 The
[ABA]{.underline} [Report]{.underline} on indigent counsel similarly
documents [judicial collusion with prosecutors in which some judges help
to ensure that defendants **[plead guilty]{.mark}**]{.underline},
sometimes without appointing counsel at all. 211 For prosecutors, [the
problem of defendant silence]{.underline} likewise
**[[ensures]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[institutional
ignorance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Prosecutors are charged with ensuring
fairness and balance,2 12 even though they will never obtain full or
balanced information about the circumstances that generate the cases
they prosecute.2 1 3 [Prosecutors]{.underline} [are]{.underline} thus
**[deprived]{.underline}** [of the worldview that might inform their
charging decisions and sentencing recommendations]{.underline}, even as
those decisions strongly predetermine the ability of the court to make
judgments about lenience.2 14 Whether defendant silence leads to harsher
charging and sen- tencing decisions is admittedly speculative. After
all, the presumption behind the privilege is precisely that defendants
will harm themselves by talking freely to prosecutors and judges. On the
other hand, the system is already remarkably harsh, 215 and [widespread
defendant [silence means]{.mark} that [there is little **empathetic** or
**educational**]{.mark} [impetus]{.mark} [for change in]{.mark} the
[perceptions]{.mark} and predispositions of these institutional
decisionmakers]{.underline}. [[Prosecutors and judges rarely contend
with the **human voice**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the person they punish,
learn his story, [or hear his]{.underline} [perspective]{.underline}.
What is true of psychologists and defense counsel is equally true for
prosecutors and judges: Learning to hear defendants despite their
differences takes education and dialogue.21 6 While there may be good
legal reasons for individual defendants to remain silent, in the long
run, [[silence is a recipe for]{.mark} continued **[institutional
hostility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 2. Social and Discursive Exclusion The
institutional silencing of defendants ensures that courts, leg-
islatures, and the public rarely hear the viewpoints, experiences, and
stories of the people at the center of the criminal justice system.
Insofar as we understand criminal law as narrative or rhetoric-even as
\"the central art by which community and culture are established,
maintained, and transformed\" 2 17-defendants do not directly partici-
pate in it, at least not while they are defendants. Defendant silence is
thus a species of the more general phenomenon that [the law silences the
disadvantaged]{.underline}. Not only does [[silence render defendants
**invisible**]{.mark}, it affirmatively shapes the law in ways that
further disadvantage them.]{.underline} As Charles Lawrence put it with
respect to [[African Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} generally, \[o\]ur
[[stories]{.underline} [have]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the most part,
[[not been]{.mark} told or [recorded in the]{.mark}]{.underline}
literature that is the [[law]{.underline}]{.mark} \.... [[We remain
**invisible** and **unheard**]{.mark} in the literature]{.underline}
that is the evidentiary database [for legal discourse,]{.underline} and
[[when we are seen]{.mark},]{.underline} in stories told by others,
[[our images are]{.mark} **severely [distorted]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[by]{.mark} the lenses of [**fear**, **bias**, and
**misunderstanding**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 218 [Feminist
[scholars]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n the **symbiotic** relationship
between [women\'s silence]{.mark} under the law [and]{.mark} [the
**dominance** of **male-centric** legal norms]{.mark} [such as]{.mark}
the \"reasonable man,\" the [devaluation of **domestic
violence**]{.mark}, and the acceptance of pornography]{.underline}. 2 19
[[Defendant silence]{.underline}]{.mark} likewise [[reinforces legal
norms of **punitiveness**, **hostility**, and
**incomprehension**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond the legal arena, the
[[media]{.underline}]{.mark} and political [spheres [are satu- rated
with]{.mark} overblown, racially charged [images of
criminals]{.mark}]{.underline} and crimi- nality, images
[which]{.underline} in turn stir up fear and are used to [support
harsher punitive measures]{.underline}. 220 [[Silent defendants cannot
compete]{.mark} with these voices]{.underline}. [[Because it eliminates
the]{.mark} primary [voices]{.mark} that might be raised [against harsh
practices]{.mark} including long sentences, inhumane prison conditions,
and deprivations of rights upon conviction, defen- dant silence helps to
**validate** such practices]{.underline}. The criminal system is not, of
course, the only place where defen- dants can speak or be spoken for.
Politics, literature, music, and other parts of the public discourse
remain. 22 1 For example, Paul Butler argues that more attention should
be paid to hip-hop because it has become a vehicle for the voices of men
of color who are familiar with the criminal justice system. Says Butler:
At the same time that an art form created by African American and Latino
men dominates popular culture, African American and Latino men dominate
American prisons. Unsurprisingly then, jus- tice-especially criminal
justice-has been a preoccupation of the hip-hop nation. The culture
contains a strong descriptive and nor- mative analysis of punishment by
the people who know it best.222 At the same time, hip-hop may be the
exception that proves the rule: Originally shunned by record labels,
mainstream media, political discourse, and other conventional speech
arenas, the creative denizens of the world dominated by the criminal
justice system managed to create a new cultural speech medium in which
they could authenti- cally speak and be heard. As Butler recognizes,
hip-hop\'s political power remains weak and should not be treated as a
substitute for dis- course in other social arenas.2 2 3 In other words,
the existence of the multi-million dollar hip-hop industry, or other
[limited public outlets for defendant voice]{.underline}, [does not
excuse or cure the **[deafening silence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that
characterizes the justice system]{.underline} and public discourse more
generally. The silence of criminal defendants thus demands recognition
as a [socio-political phenomenon]{.underline} that [harms individuals
within the criminal justice system and [skews public perceptions
of]{.mark} criminal [justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fact that
[[silence]{.underline}]{.mark} is good litigation strategy, and that it
has constitu- tional support, does not alter the fact that it
[is]{.underline} yet [another **disability** imposed on the already
overpunished defendant population, as well as a systemic dysfunction
that **[impedes progress]{.mark}** within the criminal
system]{.underline}. CONCLUSION The picture offered above is one of a
fundamentally flawed system. On the one hand, defendant silence is an
inevitable by- product of the adversarial system necessary to protect
defendants. At the same time, [widespread silencing **devalues**
defendant dignity, **con- tradicts** the expressive impulses within the
law, and **systemically excludes** [disadvantaged groups]{.mark} from
the criminal justice discourse]{.underline}. As a result, [in a
democracy that prides itself on]{.underline} its devotion to [expressive
rights]{.underline} and individual voice, **[millions]{.underline}** [of
disadvantaged]{.underline} [citizens]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
thrust into the court system, [found guilty,]{.underline} and sent off
to prison, [while uttering **nary a word** in]{.underline}
[public]{.underline}. [This bodes ill for]{.underline} individual
defendants as well as for the [democratic vitality]{.underline} of the
system. It is also a most suspect species of public policy, for [it
ensures]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} very [individuals who have
fallen through society\'s cracks [will **never be
heard**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Defendant silencing thus poses a
fundamental challenge to the criminal justice system. That challenge is
to [reconceptualize defen- dants as]{.underline} speakers rather than
objects of litigation, to turn them from abstract \"juridical
subject\[s\]\" 224 into [thinking, feeling human beings from whom, as a
society, we **need to hear**]{.underline}. [Recognizing defendants as
speakers and valuing their speech is a form of **empathy**,
**inclusion**, and **empowerment**]{.underline}. 225 [It]{.underline}
also [resonates with]{.underline} **[fundamental values]{.underline}**
of our legal [system such as]{.underline} the importance of [individual
speech, personal autonomy, and democratic participation]{.underline}.
Reconceptualizing defendant speech in these ways dovetails with the
ongoing scholarly debate over the nature and role of the adver- sarial
criminal process. Despite its illustrious pedigree, [there
is]{.underline} [a]{.underline}n increasing **[consensus]{.underline}**
[that we have an adversarial system **in name only**]{.underline}. In
reality, the [**majority** of criminal cases are handled
**administratively**]{.underline}, their outcomes are determined by
police and prosecutorial discre- tionary decisions, and [only a few
cases at the margins are actually liti- gated]{.underline} and shaped
meaningfully by defense counsel and judges. 22 6 [There is]{.underline}
also growing [recognition]{.underline} that the [few cases that make it
to rial, thus implicating the full panoply of defendant constitutional
rights, play a reduced role in shaping criminal justice norms and prac-
tices]{.underline}. **[[Plea bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}** takes
place not merely in the \"shadow\" of trial but subject to its own
internal pressures and dynamics that [have **little** to do with
constitutional criminal procedure but turn rather on institu- tional
pressures on prosecutors and defense counsel]{.underline}.2 27 More
globally, increasing attention is being paid to the ways that [the
criminal system [functions]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a form of government: criminalizing a wide
range of behavior in disadvantaged communities, and repre- senting a
model of [**[punitive social control]{.underline}** [rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} a more coopera- tive form of [[consensual
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}. 22 8 In this vein, Jonathan Simon
argues that \"advanced industrial societies ([particularly]{.underline}
the [United States]{.underline}) [are experiencing]{.underline} not a
crisis of crime and punishment but [a **crisis of
governance**]{.underline} that has led them to prioritize crime and
punish- ment as the preferred contexts for governance. \'229 This
general description resonates with the contention above-that [defendant
silence is an **anti-democratic** phenomenon]{.underline} that reflects
a public policy choice to limit the socio-political voices of defendants
in exchange for instrumental litigation advantages. By challenging the
purely instrumental, case-oriented approach to the \"right to remain
silent,\" this Article implicitly questions whether the privilege is
justifiable from a personal, dignitary, and democratic perspective. This
question cannot be answered without reference to larger unsettled
concerns about the demise of the adver- sarial model and the extent to
which the criminal system is part of a larger governance crisis. On the
other hand, I submit that these larger questions cannot be answered in
full without reference to the deaf- ening silence of defendants
themselves. Acknowledging the losses experienced by silent defendants,
and the social deformations silence creates, is thus a first step toward
**[break]{.underline}**ing **[the silencing]{.underline}** itself.

#### Coerced guilt admissions are compelled speech, using the defendant as a means to an end and denying their dignity via public humiliation

**HLR 15** \[Harvard Law Review, 12-2015, \"State v. KH-H\", Harvard Law
Review,
https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-129/state-v-kh-h/\]/Kankee

The Washington Court of Appeals, Division II, affirmed.20 Writing for
the panel, Judge Worswick21 observed that the unchallenged findings of
fact were sufficient to support a finding of guilt.22 The trial court
found that K.H.-H. touched C.R. without her consent and that the kisses,
bites, and gropes were "harmful and offensive contacts" that satisfied
the requirements of an assault with sexual motivation.23 The court
dismissed K.H.-H.'s "mixed messages" defense,24 whereby he argued that
the trial court omitted facts tending to show that C.R. did not verbally
protest and "liked \[K.H.-H.\], felt attracted to him, and had
previously . . . h\[eld\] hands and hugg\[ed him\]."25 Judge Worswick
declared that the evaluation of facts was the province of the
factfinder, and that the appellate court would not "reevaluate the
persuasiveness of the evidence and the credibility of . . .
testimony."26 Turning to the compelled speech claim, Judge Worswick
rested the majority's analysis on the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in
United States v. Clark.27 The Clark court held that a forced public
apology was constitutional if imposed "for permissible purposes, and . .
. reasonably related to \[those\] purposes."28 Judge Worswick found that
the trial judge had ordered a public apology for the permissible purpose
of rehabilitation and that the apology was reasonably related to that
purpose, as "the juvenile court noted its concern that \[K.H.-H.\] would
again offend based on his pattern of being disrespectful to women."29
The Washington constitutional defense was unavailing because article I,
section 5 had never been used to protect against compelled speech, and
K.H.-H. failed to present reasons that the Washington Constitution
should be broader than the Federal Constitution.30 Acting Chief Judge
Bjorgen dissented in part. While he agreed with the panel that there was
enough evidence to support a finding of guilt, he believed that [the
compelled letter of apology "offend\[ed\]]{.underline} [the First
Amendment]{.underline}."31 He cited the Supreme Court's rulings in West
Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette32 and Wooley v. Maynard33
for the proposition that "at the least . . [. [the State may compel
speech]{.mark} only if necessary [to prevent]{.mark} [a]{.mark} grave
and **[imminent danger]{.mark}**]{.underline}."34 He decried the
majority's use of "a presumed rational basis" test, concluding that
"\[t\]he First Amendment requires more from us."35 Instead, Acting Chief
Judge Bjorgen argued that speech could be compelled only if the
standards of Barnette were met --- that is, if the apology were
"necessary to prevent a grave and imminent danger."36 In this case, he
found that "\[t\]he State's showing \[did\] not remotely approach those
standards."37 At first blush, the question at the heart of this case
appears inane: A juvenile, convicted of an odious offense, faces no jail
time and must merely apologize to begin to put the incident behind him.
And yet he claims that [his "freedom of speech" means that he need not
say that he is sorry.]{.underline} But the principle at stake becomes
clearer if the circumstances are changed slightly.
[[Imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, that [[a juvenile]{.mark}
is [convicted of trespassing after]{.mark} [refusing to move from a
"Whites Only" section]{.mark} of a restaurant and told that he [will
serve jail time]{.mark} [unless he sends a letter]{.mark} to the owner
[admitting fault]{.mark} [and apologizing]{.mark} for the
inconvenience]{.underline}.38 The implications manifest as much more
dire indeed. [Requiring an apology compels the juvenile to make a
statement of belief that what he did was wrong and a statement of
sentiment that he regrets what he did]{.underline}. Such [an
**extraction** should require far more than the good intentions of the
sentencing judge.]{.underline} Because [a required apology involves
[making an offender say something he does not want to say]{.mark}, it
[implicates]{.mark} the Supreme Court's **[compelled speech]{.mark}**
doctrine]{.underline}. This doctrine has generally held that [[the State
cannot force]{.mark} its [citizens to speak messages]{.mark} that [they
do not wish to deliver]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 [Its strong, broad
interdiction of [**coercing speech** has been **watered down**
by]{.mark} courts in the context of [prison]{.mark}]{.underline} and
probation, where constitutional rights are weakened. The justifications
for reducing First Amendment rights40 in the context of compelled
apologies, however, are insufficient to warrant the level of control
sought by the government. [There is another way to achieve many of the
State's objectives without putting to offenders the direct dilemma of
either making an expression against their wishes or going to jail for
their silence.]{.underline} A natural place to begin is the Supreme
Court's compelled speech doctrine. The First Amendment's "[freedom of
speech]{.underline}"41 [has been understood as "necessarily comprising
the decision of both what]{.underline} [to say and what **not to
say**]{.underline}."42 Just as the State is not permitted to ban speech
because it offends the sentiments of citizens,43 so too [the State
cannot require speech of citizens in support of its
views]{.underline}.44 In the seminal case of Barnette, a group of West
Virginia parents and children brought suit against a West Virginia
school board resolution requiring students to salute the American flag
or face expulsion.45 The Supreme Court, overruling a case decided just
three years earlier,46 declared that the First Amendment could not
countenance such an obligation: "If there is any fixed star in our
constitutional constellation, [it is that no official, high or petty,
can prescribe what shall be orthodox . . . or force citizens to confess
by word or act their faith therein."]{.underline}47 The prohibition
against compelled speech was further strengthened in Maynard. There, a
New Hampshire driver objected to the state's motto of "Live Free or Die"
on religious and political grounds and desired to obscure the phrase on
his license plate.48 The Supreme Court enjoined the state from enforcing
its laws preventing obstruction of the motto on First Amendment
grounds.49 Finding that the state's requirement that Maynard display its
motto rendered his license plate a "'mobile billboard' for the State's
ideological message," the Court described [the burden]{.underline} as an
obligation "to [be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an
ideological point of view he finds unacceptable]{.underline}."50 In
broad terms, the Court stated: "\[[[W\]here the State's interest is to
disseminate an ideology,]{.mark} no matter how acceptable to some, [such
interest cannot outweigh]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n individual's First
Amendment [right to avoid becoming the courier]{.mark} for such
message]{.underline}."51 Absent any other factors, K.H.-H.'s
constitutional case would seem straightforward: [the State's demand of
an apology requires nonfactual speech that K.H.-H. does not want to
provide and is thus **impermissible**]{.underline}.52
[[Apologies]{.mark} [include]{.mark} both [an indication of the moral
propriety of a law]{.mark}]{.underline},53 [[and a public admission of
fault]{.underline}]{.mark}.54 [[The State]{.mark} thus [intended to use
him as a]{.mark} [vehicle for its message]{.mark} despite his personal
disagreement]{.underline}.55 But the State in KH--H argued that this
case was an exception to the general rule because K.H.-H.'s conviction
diminished his right to be free from compelled speech.56 And indeed,
those convicted and on probation do suffer restricted rights,57 with
only a reasonable connection to "goals of probation" required for such
restrictions.58 But this [limited review for First Amendment
rights]{.underline} of probationers makes little sense, and has [led to
**judicial mischief** across the country.]{.underline} The
justifications for lowered protections for probationers generally have
been premised on one of two theories: the idea that probation is a grace
granted to offenders or that the offender has waived any objection by
accepting probation rather than jail.59 The Supreme Court has rejected
the former,60 and the latter implicates the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine.61 Contentions that a compelled apology is acceptable because
the offender's age reduces his right to speech are also unavailing.62
Thus, the only justification is the acknowledged reduction of First
Amendment rights in the prison and probation contexts.63 But the
rationale for equal restrictions for prisoners and probationers in the
freedom-of-speech context makes little sense. First Amendment
restrictions in a prison system serve different interests than do
restrictions on a probationer, who is already interacting in some manner
with society.64 Without the broad discretion afforded prison officials
for institutional security,65 the only interests whose furtherance would
justify a reduction of probationers' First Amendment rights are
protection of the public and rehabilitation.66 Neither is convincing as
a motivation for reducing the level of scrutiny for compelled speech.
The government's reliance on the need to protect the public makes some
sense with regard to probability of harm. A citizen convicted of
breaking the law, upon release to the public, is more likely to commit
further crimes,67 and so the State's suspicion that citizens on
probation may break the law again may well be justified.68 But
restrictions of free speech rights before they are exercised implicate
the menace of prior restraints, a remedy long considered suspect in
English and American speech jurisprudence.69 Circuit courts have
reasoned, however, that some prior restraints of probationers are
permissible for positive free speech rights (such as protest or
association) on the rationale that exposure to situations similar to
previous violations invites future ones70: the overeager protester may
break the law in his zeal, so he is prevented from protesting.71 Yet
even supposing that the First Amendment could countenance prior
restraints for probationers, making a citizen speak a message not his
own has little to do with stopping crimes. At best, it operates as a
method of forcing a potential reoffender to reconsider his actions
before attempting similar misdeeds in the future. This basis is better
placed under the rubric of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation argument
boils down to the question of how much personal autonomy the
Constitution shields in cases where a citizen has been shown to have
broken the law. Many protected demonstrations of First Amendment speech
have been curtailed in the name of rehabilitating criminals.72 The State
clearly has a compelling interest in preventing future violations of the
law and in either convincing law-breakers of the justness of the law or
accustoming them to a law-abiding life. In the prison context, the
Supreme Court has upheld the severe curtailment of all forms of leisure
reading as an incentive to correct behavior.73 In the realm of
probation, judges have been known to restrict the right to procreate as
a condition.74 These restrictions reflect the fact that probationers "do
not enjoy 'the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but
only . . . conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of
special \[probation\] restrictions.'"75 It is not clear, however, that
the freedom from compelled speech is a "conditional liberty." It can be
distinguished from most other freedoms by the simple fact that it is a
protection against a violation of the individual freedom of thought (an
even greater violation than silencing76), tantamount to an attempted
"inva\[sion of\] the sphere of intellect and spirit."77 The danger must
be "grave" indeed to warrant such forced professions.78 But [the
benefits of [compelled apologies are]{.mark} more focused on
**[punitive]{.mark}** rather than rehabilitative purposes]{.underline}.
[A court-compelled apology is [unlikely to effect]{.mark} [true]{.mark}
contrition or [remorse]{.mark}]{.underline}; one commentator describes
it as "[a drop in the ocean of a convict's
socialization]{.underline}."79 Rather than truly rehabilitate, [forced
speech is more likely at best [to **humiliate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Immanuel Kant described the purpose of forced apologies as retributive:
"\[T\]he humiliation of the pride of such an offender . . . will
compensate for the offense as like for like."80 [It is unclear
how]{.underline} beneficial such [humiliation will]{.underline} [be in
convincing offenders that a law is just and should be
followed]{.underline}, but several scholars are skeptical.81 There is
another way to achieve the rehabilitative objective sought by the State.
If the government wishes to reward those who voluntarily express
contrition before sentencing, it may do so.82 Indeed, rewarding
voluntary contrition makes more sense, as it more closely aligns with
the rehabilitation justification. [[Insincere]{.mark} [apologies]{.mark}
have been described as "**worthless**]{.underline},"83 [and serve mainly
as an opportunity to **humiliate** the offender]{.underline}. True
apologies help the offender, the victim, and society in general. At the
same time, [requiring a "sincere" apology from an]{.underline}
[offender]{.underline}84 [[forces]{.underline} [him
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [either [lie to the State]{.mark} and sell the
apology [or]{.mark} [undergo an]{.mark} [emotional transformation that
changes his belief]{.mark} on the subject]{.underline}. [[Both are
**deeply problematic**]{.mark} [intrusions on]{.mark} the
[individual]{.mark}'s]{.underline} [[autonomy]{.mark} and run counter
to]{.underline} the theory of [the First Amendment]{.underline}. With
regard to the latter, [the "marketplace of ideas" relies on the conflict
of beliefs in the hope that the truth will out]{.underline}.85 [[By
adding false professions of belief]{.mark}, [the State is **artificially
altering the market**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in an attempt to make its
product more popular]{.underline}. But courts have already rejected this
strategy.86 In KH--H, the Washington Court of Appeals was afforded a
rare chance to address this problem. Given the short sentence duration
and the coercive nature of the choice offered to offenders, most take
the deal. An appellate court, removed from the conflict presented to a
lower court,87 is likely the surest medium for removing this First
Amendment violation. And there was no need to defer to the federal
courts' deficient reasoning in this realm.88 In nonetheless accepting
the prosecution's justification of "rehabilitation," the court permitted
the continuance of an egregious wrong in sentencing practices. The
implication of the extent of the "rehabilitation" justification is that
courts can demand that civil disobedients recant and jail them for their
defiance. The particularly severe consequences at play when the State
wishes to compel a citizen to speak against his will and confess a
belief in something with which he disagrees strongly militate against
adopting a test of mere reasonable relationship to "rehabilitation,"
with enormous deference on what constitutes rehabilitation. Rather, a
higher level of scrutiny should serve to determine whether the
government's interest is truly compelling enough. In most cases, it will
fail. The behavior of which K.H.-H. was convicted was repugnant. And if
the concern that K.H.-H. would continue to be disrespectful to women is
well founded, Washington is right to denounce such a knavish attitude.
But [to convince him to announce the validity of its position,
[Washington must **use persuasion, not coercion**]{.mark}]{.underline},
notwithstanding his due conviction. [As much as we might like to
encourage contrition, when it comes to a choice between jail and a
compelled apology, the First Amendment means never having to say you're
sorry.]{.underline}

#### Legalistic legitimizing of lies is immoral -- the law ought to prioritize truth and not encourage deception

INTRODUCTION Lies are everywhere today. Their pervasiveness has
amplified traditional debates about how the law can and should respond
to lies. Within these debates, it is received, if contested, wisdom that
[the law and commonsense morality disfavor lying]{.underline}, with
permissible lies form- ing an uneasily tolerated exception. 2 [The doom
scroll of lie-induced harms seems to reinforce this wisdom, underscoring
the importance of ideals about truth]{.underline}. 3 But this largely
unexamined reflex carries with it a danger: we risk blinding ourselves
to the depth and breadth of the law's response to lying and the
complexity of justice's commitment to truth. Legal scholars have long
focused on law either penalizing or per- mitting lies, but the law takes
other approaches to deception as well. In this Article, I show that
[[the law]{.mark} also accepts lies in express satisfac- tion of legal
requirements and likely [**requires lying**]{.mark} in increasingly
common situations]{.underline}. 4 This phenomenon often passes without
notice. [Courts are discreet and may not call these acts
lies]{.underline}. 5 [But]{.underline} **[[a lie by any other name is
two]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [[in]{.mark} [accepting]{.mark} these
acts ([and]{.mark} [mislabeling them]{.mark}), [the law **legitimizes
lies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Using trade secrets as a case study, I show
how law legitimizes lying. Trade secret law provides a remedy for theft
of a company's confidential information---but only if a company has
taken "reasona- ble precautions" to keep the information secret. 6 Enter
the lie: decoys, mislabeled scripts, phishing simulations, honeypots,
obfuscation, mis- information, the \$1.5 billion industry in "deception
technology," to name a few, are all deceptive precautions that
straightforwardly sat- isfy this reasonable precaution requirement. 7
What is more, if decep- tion is really the "next big thing" in
information security---as trade publications and even the Wall Street
Journal recently declared8 ---then trade secret law will increasingly
require such precautions as "reason- able precautions."9 Other areas of
law similarly focused on avoiding harm, such as negligence, may follow.
All of these precautions are [deceptive practices]{.underline}, and many
unde- niably involve lies. 10 They [present falsehoods as true, in
contexts where the audience is invited to rely on the representation
made]{.underline}. 11 This fits squarely within current philosophical
analyses of lying. 12 But these analyses have yet to gain recognition
within the legal literature. Some scholarship---particularly commentary
aimed at justifying stronger anti-lie prohibitions---focuses on a very
narrow concept that excludes much of what the law counts as lies. 13
Other scholars include within the concept of a lie not merely the
description of the action, but also the value judgment that lying is
wrong---which then makes it very difficult to talk about what exactly is
wrong (or not) with lying. 14 An important contribution of this Article
is to bring recent philosophical work on lying to bear on the legal
debate moving forward. 15 In addition to denying that common deceptive
precautions are lies, there are other ways of resisting my claim that
trade secret law legitimizes lying and exploring them proves fruitful.
"Reasonable pre- cautions" sets a floor, but not a ceiling, on the
precautions that may be taken to protect a trade secret. 16 Equity,
criminal law, torts, and other doctrines and substantive laws not
considered may provide such limits and create legal risk. Such limits
are not categorical, but they are com- plicated.17 Far from undermining
the analysis, such limitations raise further questions: if I am right,
lawyers specializing in deceptive prac- tices---deception
specialists---will be needed, 18 raising interesting ten- sions with the
ethical rules that seem to preclude encouraging clients to lie.19 This
is not a niche curiosity. Trade secret law protects key infor- mation
assets: data and algorithms. 20 Meanwhile, digitization and re- mote
work are eroding the effectiveness of facilities-based precautions,
trends accelerated by the pandemic. 21 But corporate secrets are not the
only thing at stake: that data includes personal data and those
algorithms can be manipulated. 22 Trade secret decisions about
"reasonable precautions" are harbingers of what is to come in other
areas of the law, like negligence. What are we to make, then, of the
phenomenon of the law legiti- mizing lies? And particularly, what the
phenomenon entails about the relationship between law and truth? Some
scholars and many practitioners believe [that a corollary of the law's
commitment to truth is a general disfavor or prohibition on lies and
deception, as lies and deception]{.underline} are often thought to
[under- mine truth]{.underline}. 23 This corollary is somewhat
controversial 24 and perhaps unlawful,25 but it (or at least its
normative version) is experiencing a renaissance. 26 It comes down to
defaults: Is the law's default setting to disfavor lies and make
exceptions by permitting certain ones? Or is the law generally neutral,
despite its supposed commitment to truth, picking out certain lies and
deceptions to police? Which is true as a descriptive matter, and which
should be true as a normative one? The trade secret case study presented
here constitutes strong evi- dence that the neutral view provides the
better descriptive picture, and that the neutral view may be more
consistent with the commit- ment to truth than the anti-lie corollary.
The case study also makes defending the corollary harder because
ordinary morality cannot ground a legal objection to the law's
legitimizing lies. The moral status of the lies at issue are contested
(as a descriptive, not normative, mat- ter), dooming any "Argument from
Morality" that the law cannot work this way. 27 Challenging the Argument
from Morality confirms the breadth of the claim---that law legitimizes
lies---while providing a framework for further work. Trade secret law
provides a natural starting point be- cause a common exception to the
rule against lying is for protective lies---lies that protect persons or
property by keeping a secret. 28 But interestingly, the exception for
protective lies is not what defeats the Argument from Morality. And so
my analysis's implications extend beyond trade secrets and protective
lies, to areas ranging from privacy to procedure to professional
responsibility---to name only a few. Map- ping this ethical terrain
provides a framework for further work in these other areas of law. These
two strikes against the anti-lie corollary come at a time when rampant
misinformation threatens the primary argument against the anti-lie
corollary---that the best remedy for false speech is more speech. 29 But
my case against the Argument from Morality is a de- scriptive one, about
what ordinary morality holds and whether it can affect the law. We may
still have normative concerns about whether, despite what ordinary
morality suggests, the law should legitimize ly- ing in this manner. 30
I do not minimize these concerns, and I believe that those who do err.
But the law has a solution: it can lie. Unlike others, I entertain the
possibility that the law's deception on this score is a feature, not a
bug.31 And so I do not believe that the ultimate question---whether law
should legitimize lying---is the next or even most important ques- tion
to ask. The next questions instead concern how to lie as legally and
ethi- cally as possible, if possible. The case study illustrates that
lying is not special. It is like other dual-use technologies---tools
that can be used either responsibly or illicitly, for good ends or bad.
32 The important question for lying, as with all dual-use technologies,
is how it is used and whether such uses can be managed. Only then can we
answer the ultimate question of whether and when the law should
legitimize lies, and whether it should do so openly. This Article thus
represents a sharp break, on multiple dimen- sions, from trends in the
growing body of literature on the law of lies and deception. That
literature generally focuses on whether and how the law can (or should)
penalize lying, or else permit it. 33 These ques- tions have always been
relevant in diverse areas from commercial law to procedural issues to
criminal prosecution. 34 And these questions are of increasing
importance and urgency as the problems of misinforma- tion and fake news
loom paramount. 35 But, as I argue here, there is another way to think
about them, and it does not begin by assuming (or trying to justify the
view) that lying is bad. The Article proceeds as follows. Part I
canvasses the literature's traditional framing of the law's response to
lying, and then offers con- ceptual clarity about what a lie is,
correcting common errors in the literature. Armed with this background,
Part II turns to the Article's central case study: trade secrets. Part
II shows how this increasingly important body of law accepts lies as a
legitimate option for fulfilling its reasonable precaution requirement,
and how it might require lying under increasingly common circumstances.
Part III turns to various strategies for resisting this account,
including the Argument from Mo- rality and the objection that these are
not really lies, among others. Finally, Part IV builds from the case
study in Part II and the analysis of Part III to explain the normative
and ethical implications moving forward. Developing a positive,
pragmatic theory of lies and deception in the law is growing
increasingly urgent. [Recent events and the scourge of online
[misinformation]{.mark} [demonstrate]{.mark}, palpably, [lying's
**dangers**]{.mark} and the difficulty of controlling
deceptions]{.underline}. 36 Meanwhile, lying is fast be- coming one of
the best---and possibly only---ways to defend against cyberthreats37 and
to preserve autonomy in the shadow of mass sur- veillance. 38 This
Article does not answer all of the questions these di- lemmas raise, but
it takes a critical step by showing the full breadth of what constitutes
lying and exploring the breadth and depth of the law's response. I. ON
THE SUPPOSED PROHIBITION AGAINST LYING There is much disagreement about
lying, but [most agree]{.underline} that [[ly- ing is]{.mark} generally
[wrong]{.mark}]{.underline} even if most (regrettably) lie. The
traditional legal debates over the relationship between the law and
lying focus on the scope of that prohibition, and so on issues of
punishment, toler- ance, and justification. There is also much
disagreement about what lying is, though it often goes unstated. As a
result, the legal literature has often missed developments in the
philosophical literature that clarify the concept of lying in important
ways. To appreciate how the law's response to lying is both broader and
deeper than typically assumed, we need to appreciate the focus of the
existing debate about the law's response, and we need to get clear about
what lying is---what actions, specifically, are we concerned with? In
Section I.A, I describe the traditional debates. In Section I.B, I
discuss the definition of lying and how it compares to deception. A. The
Law of Lying There is general agreement within both ordinary and
philosophi- cal morality that lying is wrong, at least in a majority of
central cases. 39 But there is much less agreement about why, and the
circumstances where lying is permitted (if any). Some situate the wrong
of lying within a generally consequential- ist (or utilitarian)
framework, 40 focusing on the bad consequences that result.41 These
views are generally more permissive of lying because the wrong of a lie
is contingent on the harm that might result. 42 Other theorists follow a
nonconsequentialist approach, arguing, for example, that [the wrong of a
[lie]{.mark} is that it [is an]{.mark} [**affront** to]{.mark} human
autonomy, agency, or **[dignity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 43 These views
are generally less permis- sive, though some define "lie" more narrowly
so as to not count per- missible lies as lies.44 Immanuel Kant is
probably the most famous for this approach, and many take his view to be
that [lying is wrong be- cause [it]{.mark} [uses another
person]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, specifically, [[her reason---as
**mere** **means**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 45 Still others have attempted
to reconcile these two approaches. 46 In addition, there is a sense in
which [[all lying is]{.mark} necessarily [an affront to the
truth]{.mark}, [because it breaks]{.mark} many of the [linguistic rules
that make conversation possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. 47 Common to all
these accounts is a general anti-lying attitude, and any plausible
account of lying will need to ac- count for this discomfort with lying
or else explain why such discom- fort is misplaced. Legal debates
concerning lying generally fall into these same par- adigms. Some, like
Saul Levmore and Richard Posner, have advanced a cost-benefit view of
the law's decision to penalize or permit lying, both as a general matter
48 and in specific contexts like contracts, 49 marketing, 50 and
undercover reporting.51 As with the philosophical de- bates, this
broadly consequentialist approach is more permissive of ly- ing than
alternatives---and occasionally skeptical of a categorical prohibition.
By contrast, others, like Aditi Bagchi, have offered non-
consequentialist accounts which draw narrow exceptions to the prohi-
bition, often limited to cases where lying serves as a defense against
wrongdoing or is justified by background injustice. 52 Still others walk
the line between these approaches, seeking to articulate a more uni-
fied description of the varied moral norms animating the law's deci-
sion to penalize (or permit) lying and deception in given cases. 53 More
so than the philosophical debate, the legal debate tends to address
specific contexts in which lying and deception occur, rather than as a
unified theory across different substantive areas. 54 This is perhaps
not surprising, given the looming specter of the First Amend- ment and
how its application varies with context. 55 The most compre- hensive
treatment to date is that of Seana Shiffrin, who advances a "qualified
\[moral\] absolutism about lying" in the nonconsequentialist tradition
and argues for stronger legal regulation of lying than tradi- tionally
thought possible or prudent. 56 Whatever the strengths or implications
of these varying views, common to all of them is a generally prohibitive
outlook that focuses on the line between lies that are prohibited (and
so penalized) versus those that are permitted (and so not penalized).
This is, perhaps, not surprising. [[The law is]{.underline}]{.mark}
customarily viewed as **[[embodying]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or at least
aspiring to, [[a]{.mark} **[commitment to truth]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
57 [[Misrepresentations are **barred**]{.mark} by the rules of
professional conduct and can provide the basis for civil
liability]{.underline}; 58 [criminal offenses involving fraud are the
"most frequently charged" and "most widely and variously
codified]{.underline}." 59 Even where the law might be said to
"welcome\[\] [deception]{.underline}," as with police interroga- tion
tactics and other prosecutorial deception, it [is]{.underline} often
"[not officially sanctioned]{.underline}" but condoned through
"indifference" 60 ---and perhaps un- easily so. And [those lies that
escape penalty are typically recast or reframed as something else, like
"mere puffery]{.underline}." 61 In other words, [[permissive lies
are]{.mark} generally treated as [the exception rather than the
rule]{.mark}]{.underline}, some as true exceptions (i.e., justified),
some by definitional ex- clusion, and some escaping penalty because of
the law's limitations (especially First Amendment limitations). 62
Recent events suggest this seeming default is not without reason.
Theranos, a startup with a purportedly "cutting-edge blood-testing
system," catapulted to unicorn status---a startup valued at over \$1
bil- lion---by misrepresenting a key fact about its proprietary
blood-testing technology; namely, that the technology did not exist. 63
Worse still, Theranos defended its deceptive practices by crying "trade
secrets." 64 John Carreyrou's chronicle of Theranos's rise and fall
reads like a case study of the numerous ways in which lies and deception
cause harm: 65 There are the obvious direct and indirect harms from
false beliefs in the reliability of Theranos' technology, not only to
investors and busi- ness partners, but also, more devastatingly, to
patients. 66 There is the blatant use of others as mere means. And
[there is the undermining of trust]{.underline} among employees.
Carreyrou even suggests that the Theranos scandal arose from [a
culture]{.underline} that **[rewarded deceptions]{.underline}**: though
taken to extremes, Theranos followed Silicon Valley's "vaporware"
playbook---the practice of securing investments for "already" devel-
oped software and hardware innovations that would "take years to
materialize, if . . . at all." 67 When one adds the pervasive and
detrimental effects of fake news and misinformation on social media,
from politicians, and within the news itself---and the new dangers
presented by sophisticated deep fake technologies that enable every ill
from involuntary porn to so- phisticated forgeries---it is easy to fear
the sky is falling. 68 Not surpris- ingly, much recent work argues for
stronger prohibitions on lying. 69 But all this attention to the line
between penalizing and permit- ting, between wrong lies and exceptions,
overlooks the breadth and depth of the law's potential responses. We
will return to that question in Part II after getting some conceptual
clarity about what a lie is. B. What Is a Lie?

#### Plea bargains encourage lying. Trials are premised on truth

**Johnson 22** \[Thea Johnson, associate professor of law at Rutgers Law
School, 6-1-2022, Lying at Plea Bargaining," Georgia State University
Law Review,
https://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3139&context=gsulr\]/Kankee

But each of these lies also achieved something important for the
defendant and the other stakeholders in the plea process. They allowed
the parties to resolve the cases in a way that led them to some rough
form of justice---a [justice]{.underline} that [would not be available
if the case had been]{.underline} [resolved with a plea that did not
rely on a lie]{.underline}. The process therefore allowed the parties to
sidestep the law without changing the law. Indeed, this is what plea
bargaining achieves every day in courtrooms across the country. It
provides a mechanism to negotiate around---often unfair---laws. At the
same time, it helps keep those laws intact by diverting problems with
their impact into the realm of plea bargaining rather than law reform.
This Article explores lying at plea bargaining to tell a story about
plea bargaining more broadly. Indeed, the [lies]{.underline} described
here [are [plea]{.mark} [bargaining]{.mark}, not a secretive adjunct to
the process]{.underline}. But the focus on lying centers our attention
on the paradox at the heart of plea bargaining: pleas help resolve
injustice, while making sure the laws that create such injustice remain
unchanged. And the lies that the parties tell at plea bargaining serve
as the most powerful case study for this paradox. To demonstrate this
paradox, this Article does two things. First, it identifies a taxonomy
of lies one sees at plea bargaining. These lies fall into three broad
categories: lies about facts, lies about law, and lies about process.
Depending on one's perspective, [the criminal justice system
[produces]{.mark}]{.underline} a litany of injustices.4 [[Implicitly
authorized, systemic lying]{.mark}]{.underline} 5 offers a means of
dealing with these perceived injustices, and as the taxonomy below
demonstrates, lying assists stakeholders in avoiding the results of
unfair laws or inequitable outcomes. In many cases, the stakeholders in
charge of producing those inequitable outcomes simply work around the
system through often invisible lies. Thus, [untruthful plea bargains
allow defendants to avoid sex offender registration, deportation, severe
prison sentences, or fines]{.underline}. In some cases, untruthful pleas
have even allowed innocent defendants to avoid the death penalty.6
Second, this Article explores the paradox that these lies reveal and
what they tell us about the prospects of meaningful criminal justice
reform. For many defendants, lying offers the only way to escape
injustice in their individual cases. Yet such [[lying makes it]{.mark}
[**impossible** to]{.mark} fundamentally [improve the]{.mark} broader
criminal [system]{.mark}, [which would make]{.mark} the [lies
unnecessary]{.mark} in the first place]{.underline}. Or put another way,
lawyers have created strategies to resolve cases fairly in an unfair
system, and these [[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} exist because the
modern plea process is simultaneously very flexible and not transparent.
These strategies [[**obscure** how the system would]{.mark}
[function]{.mark} if it worked [as designed]{.mark}, making
it]{.underline} difficult or even **[impossible]{.underline}** [to
transform]{.underline} the [unfair]{.underline} [laws]{.underline} and
policies [that lawyers]{.underline} and judges [find themselves
scrambling to work around]{.underline}. The taxonomy then leads to a
critical finding for criminal justice reformers, local and federal
legislators, and a public with a renewed interest in the criminal
system. In any given jurisdiction, the scope and size of the current
criminal system is profound, characterized by thousands of [criminal
statutes]{.underline}, numerous [sentencing schemes,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} a bewildering array of [collateral
consequences]{.underline}. Although, in theory, these "inputs" [should
produce a defined set of potential "outputs]{.underline}" (in other
words, the charges, sentences, and other penalties that an individual
defendant faces), they do not. Instead, as seen in the examples at the
start of this Article, the [parties]{.underline} involved
**[stretch]{.underline}** [and **bend** each individual case until they
reach a desired resolution]{.underline}. [This [flexibility]{.mark}
without boundaries [is made possible by the **lack of
transparency**]{.mark} [at]{.mark} [plea
bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both those working inside [[the]{.mark}
criminal [system]{.mark}]{.underline} and those peering in [[have
no]{.mark} real [understanding of how]{.mark} this morass of [laws would
work if plea bargaining did not serve as a]{.mark} **[safety
valve]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} many of [its **worst**
features]{.mark}]{.underline}. That said, although [efforts to make the
system more transparent]{.underline} (and, by extension, less flexible)
[would result in fewer lies]{.underline} [and a better understanding of
the system]{.underline}, these efforts would also do tremendous harm to
individual defendants. If we imagine lying at plea bargaining
disappearing tomorrow, defendants throughout the criminal system would
lose their primary means of circumventing the injustices of the system.
They would feel real, immediate harm. Hence, the paradox also presents a
reformer's dilemma that pits transparency and truth against flexibility
and individualized notions of justice. Lying at plea bargaining
continues because it allows defendants the opportunity to negotiate fair
resolutions to their cases in the face of an unfair system, even as that
lying makes way for---and sustains---the unfair laws it seeks to avoid.
In an entrenched system, should a reformer who cares about justice
embrace transparency or keep the system functioning as is? This dilemma
reflects real debates among lawyers and policymakers, both seeking a
path towards fairer outcomes. As this Article demonstrates, the
dichotomy between saving the system or the individuals who are processed
through that system often ignores broader visions of transformation that
do not fit neatly into either category. The Movement for Black Lives and
abolitionist movements present at least one such reimagining, which
highlight how reform around the edges does not address the systemic
injustice at the core of our criminal system. Indeed, we must recognize
that the [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the taxonomy described here
[[are]{.underline} [workarounds]{.underline}]{.mark} [[for a system so
**barbaric**]{.mark} that [lawyers]{.mark} are willing to [lie]{.mark}
to help defendants avoid the worst of it]{.underline}. Such a system
will not be fixed through more transparency or more flexibility for the
stakeholders. Rather, the paradox presented here calls for a
reconceptualization of the system as a whole. Part I of this Article
explores the ways in which trials---the natural comparison point for
pleas---constrain and discourage outright lying. It then identifies the
characteristics of [the plea process that make lying both possible and
**probable**]{.underline}. Part II details the taxonomy of plea
bargaining lies, which include lies about facts, lies about law, and
lies about process. Finally, Part III explores how this taxonomy of lies
demonstrates the paradox of plea bargaining, namely that the strategies
lawyers have come up with to avoid the injustices of the system are the
same strategies that make the system unknowable to those outside of it,
thus allowing the core injustice of the criminal system to survive. Part
III then offers some solutions to improve the current model but makes
clear that such solutions will not disentangle the laws, sentencing
schemes, and mandatory collateral consequences that encourage lying in
the first place. I. TRIALS, PLEAS, AND LIES In 1966, the Supreme Court
declared that "\[[t\]he basic purpose of a trial is the determination of
truth]{.underline} . . . ."7 This purported goal of the criminal system
makes sense. [A system that seeks truth will likely produce just
results]{.underline}. [[Truth]{.underline}]{.mark} [does not guarantee
**justice** but]{.underline} "[[is an]{.mark} [**essential**
**precondition**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[it]{.underline}. [[Public legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, as much as
justice, [demands **[accuracy]{.mark}**]{.underline} in verdicts."8 Even
though trials are largely vanishing from the criminal system,9 scholars
and courts have examined plea bargaining and its relationship to trials
because the comparison remains useful. There is a large body of
constitutional and procedural law that has developed around trials with
the goal of making trial outcomes fairer and more accurate. The outcomes
produced by plea bargaining have received much less attention from
courts. Thus, scholars and courts ask: what trial rights should extend
to a defendant at plea bargaining? Is plea bargaining done in the shadow
of the trial? What is the goal of plea bargaining beyond trial
avoidance? And most importantly, should plea bargaining's basic purpose
be the determination of truth? [[Truth-seeking is a]{.mark}
**[foundation]{.mark}al** goal of the trial]{.underline}, even though,
as a practical matter, the truth may not always emerge. There are many
ways in which the legal system messages that trials are truth-seeking
endeavors. For instance, [truth appears as a **core principle** of [the
adversarial system]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout opinions by the
Supreme Court and lower courts;10 [the overarching logic of the [rules
of evidence]{.mark} places truth as a **central value**]{.underline};11
and [studies on public perceptions note that trials are understood to be
spaces where truth emerges]{.underline}.12 As such, [explicit lies
are]{.underline} generally [**prohibited** at]{.underline}
[trials]{.underline}, and there are many ways in which trials require
the truth. [Witnesses must [testify under oath]{.mark}]{.underline}13
[and can be punished with a [perjury]{.mark} charge if they fail to tell
the truth]{.underline}.14 In theory, [evidence rules exclude unreliable
evidence and highlight reliable evidence]{.underline}.15 A series of
[ethical rules]{.underline} also [require candor]{.underline} by the
parties before the tribunal.16 Finally, [[cross-examination]{.mark} is
intended to be an "**engine**" for truth-seeking]{.underline}, [allowing
adverse parties to **root out** dishonesty]{.underline} or other flaws
in witness testimony.17 Thus, trials are the means by which we discover
what really happened in a criminal case, even though truth is not always
prioritized at trial or may not be absolutely knowable.18 But plea
bargaining as a practice does not share the deep roots of trials. Plea
bargaining only became commonplace in the 1920s19 and did not receive a
stamp of approval from the Supreme Court until 1970.20 [[Plea
bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark} became popular in the early twentieth
century for two reasons: first, because it [[allowed]{.mark} judges and
[lawyers to **hide**]{.mark} their own **corrupt**
practices]{.underline}---namely, using bribes to grant defendants a
beneficial plea deal---and second, because the normalized use of pleas
allowed courts an efficient means of dealing with the burdens of a
rapidly expanding criminal system.21 The history of plea bargaining
demonstrates that [pleas were always open to [**manipulation** and
**corruption**]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 As a result, early courts were
suspicious of plea bargaining. A modern view of plea bargaining shows
that as a matter of law and practice, those fears were well-founded; [it
is much easier to lie during a guilty plea than to lie at
trial]{.underline}. This is because [the plea process]{.underline},
unlike the trial, [is]{.underline} both a flexible instrument for
resolving cases and often [**hidden** from public view]{.underline}. As
Jenia I. Turner wrote in her review of the many problems produced by
plea bargaining's lack of transparency, "\[[t\]he opacity of plea
bargaining stands in marked contrast to the constitutional commitment to
public criminal proceedings, enshrined in the **Sixth Amendment** right
to a public trial and the **First Amendment** right of public access to
the courts]{.underline}."23 Constitutionally, plea bargains have few
formal requirements. The primary requirement, with some exceptions,24 is
that the defendant accepts guilt.25 Plea bargains involve the waiver of
several rights, such as the right to a trial or the right to confront
one's accusers.26 Like other constitutional waivers, the defendant can
only give up such rights if the plea is made "voluntarily, knowingly and
intelligently."27 One basic premise of a guilty plea is that to secure
the bargain of a plea, the defendant relinquishes, among other rights,
his trial and appeal rights.28 This practice has, of course, resulted in
fewer appeals on issues involving plea bargains and further hid the
realities of the plea system. But the Supreme Court jurisprudence on
this issue only tells a sliver of the story. Plea bargaining is a local
creature. As Andrew Manuel Crespo explains, plea bargaining is
controlled not only by substantive and constitutional criminal law but
also by the "subconstitutional procedural law of the states---an
interlocking set of legal frameworks that comprises the law of joinder
and severance, the law of preclusion, the law of cumulative sentencing,
the law of pretrial charge review, the law of dismissal and amendment,
and the law of lesser offenses."29 Although these interlocking legal
frameworks constrain prosecutors to some extent, they also make plea
bargains more difficult to understand and regulate in any sort of
generalized way. Beyond the law, the local practice of judges and
attorneys also control plea bargaining. Within the same courthouse, one
judge may agree to accept Alford pleas,30 while another may not. Some
judges insist on a full memorialized record for every plea, whereas
others merely accept the agreements of the parties.31 As one judge in
Ohio put it, there are "disparate judicial philosophies that exist and
operate among the hundreds of state court judges regarding the judge's
role in the plea negotiation process\[,\] . . . \[and\] each individual
judge has his or her own approach \[to the plea process\] . . . ."32 The
formal and informal polices of a prosecutor's office also play a
critical role in regulating plea bargains, and those policies are
difficult to pin down with any sort of specificity. Although some
prosecutors have recently prioritized publishing their office
policies,33 many formal policies remain secret, available only to the
attorneys in the office.34 In addition, unwritten policies may exist in
a particular office. Rachael Rollins, the former District Attorney for
Suffolk County in Massachusetts, noted that her open policy of not
charging certain types of crimes explicitly adopted the unspoken
policies of her predecessors.35 The fact that she publicized a
previously secret policy makes clear how difficult it is to understand
the local level regulation of plea and charge bargaining. Even more
narrowly, individual prosecutors---despite office-wide policies---may
have their own sense of justice in any individual case and therefore
their own internal rules for plea bargaining.36 This combination of lax
constitutional norms and wide-ranging procedural rules, along with a
nearly endless number of formal and informal polices governing any
particular jurisdiction, means that plea bargaining is, at best, loosely
regulated. Plea bargaining has, in fact, become much more like a system
of civil settlement with the parties negotiating along multiple paths.37
Although there is evidence that lawyers in specific jurisdictions often
ascribe a "set price" to certain charges that provide the parties some
guidance on the likely sentence offer in a case,38 it remains difficult
to say how a specific set of charges and a defendant's particular
background will calculate at plea bargaining. In this environment, lying
can flourish. II. A TAXONOMY OF LYING

#### Plea bargains are intrinsically lies -- backpedaling is perjury

C. **[Lies About Process]{.underline}** Finally, this taxonomy
identifies lies about process. Lies about process are critical to the
functioning of the criminal system; they are the grease that keep the
wheels turning. Indeed, as I describe below, these [[lies]{.mark} about
process facilitate the formal acceptance of the guilty plea, while
**[shield]{.mark}ing** from view the [realities]{.mark} of how and why
defendants decide to plead guilty.]{.underline} [They [give the process
**legitimacy**]{.mark} [while]{.mark} [maintaining the **lack of
transparency**]{.mark} that is a key characteristic of the plea
process]{.underline}. 1. The Plea Colloquy Once a defendant is ready to
plead guilty, they must enter a plea on the record and engage in a plea
colloquy with the judge.110 That colloquy is necessary because the judge
has the duty to establish that the defendant is waiving their rights
knowingly and voluntarily.111 The judge does this by asking a series of
questions about the defendant's decision to plead guilty and their
knowledge of their rights.112 But [to meet the constitutional standard,
[defendants]{.mark} often [lie during]{.mark} these
[colloquies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These lies are done [with]{.mark} the
knowledge and [approval]{.mark} of]{.underline} the other actors in the
courtroom, including [the judge, prosecutor, and defense
attorney]{.underline}. In fact, such [lies are **encouraged** so that
pleas can be recorded quickly and in accordance with statutory and
constitutional mandates]{.underline}. But defendants, despite what they
say on the record, often do not enter plea bargains knowingly or
voluntarily. For instance, to plead guilty "knowingly," [the Supreme
Court has held that defendants should be advised by competent counsel
and made aware of the nature of the charges against
them]{.underline}.113 [But]{.underline} [defendants frequently plead
guilty early in the case, often at their first appearance,
[before]{.mark} they have had a chance to review discovery or consult
with [counsel]{.mark}]{.underline}.114 Further,
**[[millions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of misdemeanor defendants across
the country [plead guilty without]{.mark} any [counsel]{.mark} at
all]{.underline}.115 To get the benefit of the plea, those [defendants
are required to affirm that they understand a panoply of rights that
they are giving up]{.underline}116 [without having a single conversation
with a lawyer]{.underline}. Even defendants with a lawyer often do not
understand the collateral consequences of pleading guilty or sometimes
even the direct consequences. Yet [[the]{.mark} guilty [plea **hinges**
on the lie]{.mark}---told every day in courts across the
country---[that]{.mark} the [defendant understands]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
nature and [consequences]{.mark} of the charges.]{.underline} The same
issues come up with establishing the voluntariness of the plea. A
voluntary plea is one in which the defendant's plea is not "induced by
threats" and improper promises.117 [[The plea]{.mark}
colloquy]{.underline} in every jurisdiction
**[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the court [to ask]{.mark} [the
defendant]{.mark} on the record [if]{.mark} they were [promised]{.mark}
[anything in exchange]{.mark} for pleading guilty]{.underline} to assess
whether such threats or improper promises are the heart of the
agreement.118 [[The "right]{.mark}" [answer]{.mark} to that question [is
"no"]{.mark} because such promises might undermine the "voluntariness"
of the plea]{.underline}. Instead, courts maintain the fiction that
defendants only plead guilty in exchange for the promised sentence and
charge laid out on the record.119 But, of course, [defendants are
promised]{.underline} all sorts of [things]{.underline}, formally and
informally, [to induce their guilty]{.underline} [pleas]{.underline}.
[These [promises cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[be acknowledged
on the record]{.mark} if the plea is to stand constitutional
muster]{.underline}. For instance, the Ninth Circuit held that a
defendant's guilty plea was not involuntary when the government promised
to drop charges against his son in exchange for his guilty plea.120 But
[had the defendant claimed that he was pleading guilty only to protect
his son]{.underline} as he later did on appeal,121 [the trial court
would have likely rejected his plea, even though the government held out
his son's prosecution as its main inducement for him to take the
plea]{.underline}. [Acknowledging]{.underline} that [he was pleading to
save his son would not have been the "correct" answer, even though it
was the truthful answer]{.underline}. In the same vein, [[a
defendant]{.mark} generally [cannot admit]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} are
[plead]{.mark}ing [guilty to sidestep]{.mark}]{.underline} immigration
[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}, reduce their sentence, or for any
of the other reasons defendants regularly plead guilty. Although some
courts may allow the defendant to give their true reasons for accepting
a plea,122 many others require the defendant to stick to a circumscribed
script at the colloquy. The following is how one judge described the
process: \[[I\]f the judge makes a sentencing commitment]{.underline} in
chambers, [it is an unspoken]{.underline} rule in some courtrooms that
[such a commitment is not to be communicated publicly, especially at the
plea hearing]{.underline}. Therefore, defense counsel must often
privately instruct \[the\] client to unequivocally answer "no" when
asked at the hearing if any promises have been made to induce the
plea\[.\] Occasionally in the courtrooms where this occurs, a defendant
will forget this important instruction from the attorney and state at
the plea hearing something to the effect . . . : "Yes, my attorney told
me I would receive a minimum sentence." There are scores of transcripts
where something like this has occurred. The embarrassed defense attorney
will then \[ask to speak to their client off the record\] \[a\]nd then
miraculously the client will resume back on the record, "No\[,\] your
honor, no promises have been made to me."123 The excerpt above makes
explicit the common understanding among stakeholders that [a defendant's
"correct" answers to the plea colloquy's queries are not necessarily
accurate answers.]{.underline} The colloquy may seem like a classic
legal fiction---a bit of oil to keep to the wheels of justice churning.
But true legal fictions are acknowledged as such; future courts
understand that when we say a corporation is a person, the corporation
does not, in fact, breathe air. [Pleas of guilty]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [receive the **imprimatur of** **truth**]{.underline}. When
the defendant says they are pleading guilty because they are guilty and
not through any promises or inducements, future courts hold that against
them.124 In fact, the high-profile case of Michael
[[Flynn]{.underline}]{.mark}, the once National Security Advisor to
former President Donald Trump, makes this clear. Flynn [pleaded guilty
on the record and then claimed, after his plea, that the government
induced his plea]{.underline} by a series of inappropriate threats,
including that they would charge his son with a crime if he did not
plead guilty.125 Flynn pleaded guilty and then [later [attempted to
withdraw his plea]{.mark}]{.underline}.126 Former U.S. Attorney General
William Barr supported Flynn and told CBS News of the case, that "people
sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes."127
[[A]{.mark}]{.underline} retired [[judge]{.underline}]{.mark}, appointed
by the district court to review the case, [[recommended a **perjury**
charge]{.mark} for Flynn's attempts to withdraw his
plea]{.underline}.128 Yet [the threat of the perjury charge by the
district court makes clear that [courts view the act of taking the plea
as the truth]{.mark}.]{.underline} This means that [[the plea]{.mark}
colloquy [has the force of truth, even though it is]{.mark}]{.underline}
quite often, at the moment of its inception, [[a]{.underline}
[lie]{.underline}]{.mark}. 2. Alford Pleas As described above, in an
Alford plea, a defendant declares his innocence at the time of the plea
while also accepting a conviction and any associated punishment.129 A
court accepts the defendant's claims of innocence only if the court is
satisfied that the defendant is actually guilty, despite holding no
trial or meaningfully testing the evidence. And this is the lie about
process---namely, the court makes a finding of guilt, even though, in
most cases, they only heard a mere recitation of facts from the
prosecutor. To understand how an Alford plea functions, we must briefly
review the Alford case itself. In Alford, the defendant was charged with
the capital offense of first-degree murder.130 Before accepting a plea,
the trial court heard sworn testimony from both sides.131 The
prosecution presented an officer, who gave a summary of the evidence.132
The defense put on Alford himself, who testified under oath that he had
not committed the murder, but to avoid the death penalty, he would plead
guilty to the reduced charge of second-degree murder.133 Relying on its
prior jurisprudence involving nolo contendere pleas,134 the Court upheld
Alford's plea of guilty: Thus, while most pleas of guilty consist of
both a waiver of trial and an express admission of guilt, the latter
element is not a constitutional requisite to the imposition of criminal
penalty. An individual accused of \[a\] crime may voluntarily,
knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison
sentence even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in
the acts constituting the crime.135 And so, the Alford plea was born. In
a footnote, Justice White affirmed that Alford pleas were only
acceptable in cases where guilt was established: Because of the
importance of protecting the innocent and of \[e\]nsuring that guilty
pleas are a product of free and intelligent choice, various state and
federal court decisions properly caution that pleas coupled with claims
of innocence should not be accepted unless there is \[some\] factual
basis for the plea, and until the judge taking the plea has inquired
into and sought to resolve the conflict between the waiver of trial and
the claim of innocence.136 But the standard for a factual basis fails to
rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; indeed, there is
no clear standard, except that the judge be convinced the defendant is
guilty, even when the defendant swears under oath---as in Alford---that
he is not.137 Furthermore, the Supreme Court provides no guidance to
trial courts on how developed a factual record must be to accept an
Alford plea. One might imagine that, given that a factual record is not
required, Alford pleas would be used only for low-level crimes when,
presumably, the stakes are low, and the factual record is simple. But
interestingly, Alford pleas are frequently used to resolve cases
involving violent crimes. One study estimated that, from 2003 to 2004,
76,000 individuals entered Alford pleas and that 50% of defendants who
took an Alford plea were incarcerated for violent crimes such as murder,
assault, and sexual assault.138 Twenty-five percent were incarcerated
for property crimes, 20% for drug crimes, and only about 4% for
public-order crimes.139 These numbers indicate that Alford pleas are not
reserved for minor or non-serious crimes. Instead, courts regularly
resolve serious, violent cases with pleas in which the defendant swears
innocence and no meaningful adjudicatory process was undertaken to get
to the truth of what happened. III. THE PARADOX OF PLEA BARGAINING

#### Negotiations bargain over facts to manufacture convenient versions of the truth to lie about

II\. A TAXONOMY OF LYING In both legal39 and philosophical40 literature,
there are various views of what constitutes a lie, and as other scholars
have observed, identifying and evaluating lying is a common problem in
the legal system,41 not just during plea bargaining. For the purposes of
the taxonomy of lies below, I adopt the "correspondence" theory of
truth, which holds that "a belief is true if there exists an appropriate
entity---a fact---to which it corresponds. If there is no such entity,
the belief is false."42 Correspondence theory looks to the world, using
facts as its benchmarks of truth, to verify a given belief as true.43 It
is enough to say that, as with a trial, there is an expectation that a
rough correspondence exists between the elements of a crime a defendant
pleads to and the acts he committed. And where parties knowingly enter
pleas that have no such correspondence, there is lying in plea
bargaining. The lies I discuss here are of a different nature than legal
fictions, a commonly used device in the legal system that allows the
system to function. Legal fictions are not meant to deceive; rather,
both those inside and outside of the process understand the role of the
legal fiction in the transaction or resolution.44 Lying at [plea
bargaining]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is deception]{.underline}.
[Even if all criminal justice actors involved understand that the plea
may be a lie, the plea deceives the outside world.]{.underline} [[The
record]{.mark} of conviction [reflects **not the truth**]{.mark} as the
parties believe it to be, [but]{.mark} rather [the agreement they
**crafted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The lie at plea bargaining is
transformed into truth for all future purposes]{.underline}.45 [Plea
bargains based on lies do not reflect the parties' understanding of the
truth of the defendant's conduct]{.underline}. Meaning, at least one or
more of the [parties]{.underline}---defense attorney, prosecutor, or
judge---[know]{.underline} or genuinely believe [that the plea is not a
reflection of the defendant's conduct]{.underline}. Yet they allow the
plea to proceed. I borrow the term "genuinely believe" from the legal
ethicist Marvin Frankel to indicate something beyond mere speculation or
guesswork.46 We often suspect something might be true or false based on
gut feeling or a survey of the facts, but genuine belief signifies that
the party, after a full review of the available evidence, truly believes
the plea does not indicate truth.47 I exclude the defendant as one of
the parties from this list because the defendant is generally the only
person who has full knowledge of the facts of his conduct, but that
truth is not always ascertainable by, or even clear to, others.
Furthermore, [[lying]{.mark} at plea bargaining
[involves]{.mark}]{.underline} a party (or [parties]{.underline})
[understanding]{.underline} some version of [the case's truth but then
[presenting a **different version**]{.mark}]{.underline} in court. The
lying I describe here is not necessarily perjury.48 Nor does it require
that some party tell a lie under oath. That said, [lies in plea
bargaining are **formalized**]{.underline}. [Even when a plea is not
taken under oath, there is an understanding that [a plea]{.mark}, unlike
a civil settlement, [represents a truthful]{.mark} and accurate
[record]{.mark}]{.underline}.49 This is what Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 11 calls for,50 as do most states' local rules.51 [Plea
bargains based on lies are thus entered into the record as the truth, as
any other guilty plea would be]{.underline}. Finally, the
[lies]{.underline} described below [are]{.underline} all [made
possible]{.underline} by two fundamental features of the broader plea
system---[a lack of transparency and an abundance of
flexibility]{.underline}. [These lies represent how these features allow
for the parties to **stretch and bend the truth** in often **extreme**
ways]{.underline}. With these characteristics in mind, I present below a
brief taxonomy of plea bargaining's lies. This taxonomy is
descriptive---a means to help us understand what lying at plea
bargaining looks like. I do not mean to identify any of the lies here as
either "bad" or "good," but rather to showcase the ways in which plea
bargains regularly result in lies,52 and that such lies conflict with
our understanding of the outcomes produced by plea bargaining. A.
**[Lies About Facts]{.underline}** I begin the taxonomy with lies about
facts. In these [pleas]{.underline}, the parties [manipulate the facts
to achieve a desired]{.underline} [result]{.underline}. For example, a
case starts with a charging document detailing the facts. That charging
document itself may be flawed, but the collection of facts through
investigation allows the parties to come to some understanding of the
truth of what occurred. In pleas that involve lies about the facts,
however, the [[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [bend or discard
facts to reach a resolution]{.underline}. 1. Fictional Pleas In a
previous article, Fictional Pleas, I explored how plea bargaining
provides an avenue for [guilty defendants]{.underline} to [[plead guilty
but to crimes they did not commit]{.underline}]{.mark}.53 Such guilty
pleas involve: \[A\] guilty plea, a factual admission of the elements of
a crime \[or a plea of nolo contendere,\] an "admission of guilt for the
purposes of the case," entered by a defendant for an offense that the
defendant did not commit, and that all the parties in the case know the
defendant did not commit.54 There are many examples of these pleas. For
instance, Fictional Pleas begins with an example of [a
defendant]{.underline} who [transformed a single felony sex offense into
three separate misdemeanor sex offenses that each corresponded to a
separate "act]{.underline}."55 [Even though]{.underline} all parties
(including the judge) agreed [there was only one criminal act, the three
misdemeanor pleas proceeded]{.underline}.56 In this way, the defendant
avoided sex offender registration and other onerous burdens accompanying
a felony sex offense.57 Plus, the prosecutor still achieved a long
sentence by running three misdemeanor sentences consecutive to one
another, while avoiding the time and expense of a trial.58 In another
jurisdiction, [a defendant was charged with]{.underline} multiple counts
of [downloading child pornography]{.underline}, along with possession of
criminal tools for his use of the computer to commit the crime.59 [The
defendant ended up pleading guilty to felonious assault, despite no
factual record to support that charge]{.underline}.60 In many drug
cases, [defense attorneys work to transform drug charges into non-drug
charges]{.underline} to help defendants avoid immigration consequences,
often [through]{.underline} the use of [fictional pleas]{.underline}.61
One extreme example out of Washington involved a defendant accused of a
violent robbery, who then pleaded guilty to "creating no less than one
thousand illegal music recordings without consent."62 As the public
defender admitted during a later interview: "There were no allegations
of sound recordings or videos. We were just being creative to get to the
point we need to get in sentencing."63 Fictional pleas abound in less
serious cases as well. Many drivers use fictional pleas to escape
traffic offenses that would add points to their license. For instance, a
2007 case in Iowa revealed that in one county, [defendants were
regularly pleading down from a variety of misdemeanor traffic offenses
to a nonmoving violation charge]{.underline} of a "cowl-lamp"
violation.64 A "cowl-lamp" is an antique fender lamp no longer used on
modern vehicles, and Iowa law prohibited motor vehicles from being
equipped with more than two side cowl-lamps.65 It is safe to say that
hundreds of drivers in Iowa were not equipping their vehicles with three
or more side cowl-lamps.66 Fictional pleas like this allow a defendant
to escape some penalty associated with the crime that he did commit,
including immigration consequences, sex offender registration, a higher
charge or sentence, or points on one's driver's license. Prosecutors
consent to these pleas because they benefit from the plea---namely, the
certainty of a criminal conviction67---and they may not have a strong
interest in seeing the defendant suffer the non-criminal penalty. In
some instances, the plea may even politically benefit prosecutors in
certain districts where local voters consider showing mercy through plea
bargaining as an asset.68 No matter the motivation, [the result is a
plea that does not reflect, and sometimes does not even relate to, the
underlying factual allegations that the parties believe to be the
truth]{.underline}. And although some states seemingly prohibit the use
of such pleas,69 for the reasons described in Part I, plea bargaining is
loosely regulated on the ground, making it unlikely that statutes and
court opinions can fully restrict their use by stakeholders.70 Indeed,
lawyers seem increasingly comfortable being open about their use of
fictional pleas, even while rejecting the term. The Michigan Supreme
Court proposed a rule change that would restrict the procedures around
plea bargaining to require that defendants provide a factual record only
to the charges of conviction.71 As the court noted, the proposed change
was meant to address the use of "fictional pleas."72 Both prosecutors
and defense attorneys objected to the proposal, arguing that such a
requirement would prevent defendants from pleading guilty to crimes they
did not commit---a tool that both sides identified as critical to
producing just results for defendants and, interestingly, victims.73 The
following are among the fictional pleas that lawyers said they relied
on: pleading a driving while under the influence case down to a failure
to report an accident;74 allowing a defendant to plead to an aggravated
assault, even where there was no factual basis of an injury as required
by the statute; using disorderly conduct---which requires proof of
intoxication in a public place---to resolve a malicious destruction of
property charge.75 2. **[[Fact Bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}** Fact
bargaining and its close cousin, charge bargaining,76 are perhaps the
original forms of lying at plea bargaining. In fact bargaining, the
defendant and prosecutor agree to certain facts, after the arrest but
often before the indictment, that define the defendant's charges. This,
in turn, can change the charges. Parties engage in fact bargaining to
achieve some particular outcome vis-à-vis the charges. For instance, the
defendant may have been charged at arrest with possessing drugs and a
gun, but through the process of fact bargaining, [the facts are modified
to indicate that the defendant only possessed drugs; the gun then
**disappears**]{.underline}.77 Or [in a statutory rape
case]{.underline}, [the prosecutor may agree to stipulate]{.underline}
to the fact that [the defendant and victim were a certain number of
years apart in age]{.underline} to ensure the defendant falls under a
less serious sexual assault statute, even if that "fact" is untrue.78
With fact bargaining, the parties reach resolution over the facts to
determine the charges, which means the [[facts are not]{.mark} a
[fixed]{.mark} dataset [but]{.mark} rather may be [**massaged** to
fit]{.mark} whatever [charge]{.mark} the parties deem fair]{.underline}.
Fact bargaining, like charge bargaining, has been practiced for decades.
For instance, in 1996, a study of federal probation officers found that
a major concern for probation officers was that "[plea
[agreements]{.mark} commonly **fail** to reflect the true facts of a
case, thus **[distort]{.mark}ing** [guideline calculations]{.mark} and
mak\[ing\] it difficult for the court to consider properly whether to
accept a plea agreement]{.underline}."79 Approximately [**[forty
percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [probation
[officers]{.mark}]{.underline} [[reported]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
"guideline calculations set forth in [[plea
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} in a majority of cases [[are not
'supported by]{.mark} offense [facts]{.mark} that]{.underline}
[accurately]{.underline} and completely [reflect]{.underline} all
aspects of [the case]{.underline}.'"80 And yet, unlike some of the other
pleas listed in this taxonomy, fact bargaining may not seem as obviously
a "lie." After all, it is a negotiation over the appropriate charges for
the defendant, and one way to arrive at those appropriate charges is
through mutual agreement on relevant facts. But a negotiation over facts
is a negotiation over truth---or the degree of truth---and falls
somewhere between a full-blown airing of the facts and a complete lie.
For instance, to say a defendant possessed a small amount of drugs when
he actually possessed a much larger amount of drugs is, to some degree,
a lie about what police found when they arrested the defendant. That lie
makes a difference in what sentence the defendant receives, and this
divergence between punishments makes clear that legislators purposefully
distinguished between two different drug amounts within the law for a
particular reason.81 But fact bargaining allows the parties to maneuver
around the legislative intent.82 Evidence that legislatures contemplate
such maneuvering83 does not negate the lie at the base of the plea;
rather it only explains the mechanisms that allow for it. 3. **[[Guilty
Pleas of Innocent Defendants]{.underline}]{.mark}** [After]{.underline}
hundreds of [overturned convictions and]{.underline} decades of
DNA-based [exonerations]{.underline}, there remains little doubt that
[people plead guilty to crimes when they are factually innocent of any
crime]{.underline}.84 The Innocence Project highlights the terrible
stories of people imprisoned for years---even decades---for crimes they
did not commit but to which they pleaded guilty.85 Indeed, despite
earlier protestations from the Supreme Court that plea bargaining does
not result in the conviction of innocent people,86 more recent
jurisprudence acknowledges that innocent people pleading guilty is a
risk of plea bargaining. As Justice Scalia noted in Lafler v. Cooper: In
the United States, we have plea bargaining aplenty, but . . . it has
been regarded as a necessary evil. It presents grave risks of
prosecutorial overcharging that effectively compels an innocent
defendant to avoid massive risk by pleading guilty to a lesser offense .
. . ."87 There is no doubt that criminal justice actors know that
innocent people plead guilty to crimes they did not commit. There are a
few ways that such "[innocence pleas" manifest themselves as
lies.]{.underline} One is where the defense attorney, who holds the
genuine belief that the defendant is innocent, allows, or even
encourages, the defendant to proceed with the plea, putting a factually
inaccurate plea (and potentially a factually inaccurate statement of
facts) on the record.88 [This sort of plea allows the defendant to avoid
what would be the worse outcome after trial, generally a harsher
sentence than the one offered with the plea]{.underline}. There is also
anecdotal evidence that [judges allow defendants to plead guilty even
when they have reason to believe the defendant is innocent]{.underline}
to prevent the defendant from receiving a long sentence after trial.89
Prosecutors also participate in innocence pleas, often in the form of
Alford pleas (which are also discussed as lies of process in Part
II.c.2).90 In an Alford plea, the defendant accepts a conviction on his
record while openly proclaiming innocence.91 Effectively, the defendant
says: "I am not guilty, but I agree to take the plea." There are several
examples of prosecutors using Alford pleas to convict defendants who the
prosecutors may themselves believe are innocent.92 Perhaps the most
famous example is the case of the "West Memphis Three."93 In 1993,
Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley, Jr., and Jason Baldwin were charged as
teenagers with murdering three eight-year-old boys in Arkansas.94
Despite flimsy evidence, the defendants were convicted. Echols was
sentenced to death, and Misskelley and Baldwin were sentenced to life in
prison.95 Exonerating evidence emerged many years after the
convictions.96 As the courts considered whether the new evidence was
grounds for a retrial, the prosecutor offered the three an Alford
plea.97 Despite the new evidence pointing to their innocence, the
defendants accepted the Alford plea, asserting their innocence, yet
acceding that the state had sufficient evidence to convict them.98 For
its part, the prosecution claimed to still believe that these defendants
were guilty.99 Their willingness to allow the defendants to walk out of
prison for the murder of three young boys clearly indicated that the
state had no such certainty. Instead, it used a plea bargain, based on a
lie, to allow the convictions to stand and the defendants to walk
free,100 likely to avoid a later civil suit. Alford pleas have been
similarly used in other cases where a defendant's innocence has been
established.101 This use of the Alford plea in this context is a
different sort of lie than the traditional use of such lying during plea
bargaining. Instead of the defendant's oral claim of innocence
performing the lie, it is the conviction itself which rests on the lie
that the factual record supports a finding of guilt. But the result,
like in other innocence pleas, is the same: a guilty plea based on a lie
as a means of resolving a case involving innocent defendants. I conclude
with a note about the defendant's role in innocence pleas. It goes
without saying that in innocence pleas, the defendant is also
facilitating the lie. Presumably, the defendant is aware of whether he
committed the crime, and when an innocent person pleads guilty to a
crime he did not commit, he is lying. From a systemic perspective, these
lies tell us much about the pressures that defendants face to plead
guilty. But these lies are different in nature than those told by other
stakeholders, mostly because the defendant is the only one who can be
certain of the truth. The other stakeholders are usually acting on
genuine belief rather than first-hand certainty. Further, what separates
defendants from other stakeholders is that, illogically, defendants tend
to have little to do with the plea process itself.102 They are often
excluded from negotiations and only play a role at the time of the
colloquy (where, as I note in Section C, the lie formally enters the
record).103 Part III.B explores in greater detail the way these
differences should shape our understanding of lying at plea bargaining,
but it is critical to note that systemically authorized lies by
defendants during the plea process are of a different nature than those
told or approved of by lawyers and judges.104 B. **[Lies About
Law]{.underline}** Although many forms of lying involve manipulations of
the law and facts---for instance, [fact bargaining allows the parties to
influence which charges (or laws) apply to the case through the
negotiation of facts]{.underline}---it is generally harder to manipulate
the laws. This makes sense; it is easier to massage the facts to fit a
law than to massage the law to fit the facts. But, as explored below,
there is one form of plea bargaining in which lawyers twist statutes
until they no longer actually represent a true law: pleas to crimes that
do not exist. 1. **[Pleas to Crimes that Do Not Exist]{.underline}**
Courts have allowed defendants to plead guilty to crimes that they could
not be convicted of at trial because the crimes do not [exist; [there
would be **no statute**]{.mark}]{.underline} on which to instruct the
jury and therefore no crime to charge. Several
[[courts]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[upheld]{.mark} [guilty pleas to
non-existent crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, a Kansas court
found [a defendant could plead to an attempted second-degree
unintentional murder]{.underline}, [even though Kansas does not
recognize]{.underline} attempted second-degree unintentional murder as
[a crime]{.underline} because "it is logically impossible for a person
to have the specific intent to commit an unintentional killing."105 The
court reasoned: Although the practice of permitting plea agreements such
as this one to stand may seem illogical at first glance, such agreements
serve a legitimate purpose. Compromises have long been permitted by our
courts. Criminal cases are resolved by plea bargains virtually every
day. As long as due process requirements are met and the bargain is
beneficial to the defendant that defendant cannot later validly
collaterally attack either the plea or bargained-for sentence.106 An
Ohio court came to a similar conclusion: if the defendant knowingly and
voluntarily pleaded guilty and received a benefit, then he could plead
to the non-existent crime of attempted involuntary manslaughter.107
[Courts have not]{.underline}, however, [allowed a defendant's
conviction of a non-existent crime after trial.]{.underline}108 Rather,
[it is **only** through plea bargaining that a defendant can secure a
conviction to a **non-existent crime**]{.underline}. One can find
several more examples of pleas to crimes that do not exist in other
jurisdictions.109 The critic may decry the description of these pleas as
lies. After all, anyone can go to the statute book and discover that
there is no such crime as an attempted unintentional murder. Despite
this, I characterize pleas to crimes that do not exist as lies for
several reasons. First, like the fictional pleas described above, these
lies are not an accurate reflection of the defendant's conduct. [[If it
is]{.mark} indeed **[impossible]{.mark}** [to attempt]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}n unintentional [crime]{.mark}]{.underline}, [then [a]{.mark}
defendant's [confession of guilt]{.mark} to such a crime [is
**impossible**]{.mark} as well, making it a lie to make such a
claim]{.underline}. Second, [all [actors]{.mark} involved in the plea
[agree]{.mark} that [the plea does not represent the]{.mark} charged
[criminal conduct]{.mark}, so there is a knowing acceptance of the lie
among the stakeholders]{.underline}. Third, [it is not always
clear]{.underline} to the outside world that [the plea represents an
impossibility]{.underline}. Although a lawyer may determine that the
defendant could not be convicted of the same conduct at trial, such a
conclusion may fall outside the purview of any non-criminal justice
actors looking at the plea. Nonetheless, the conviction attaches to the
defendant's record, becoming a part of the defendant's criminal history.
C. Lies About Process

#### Systemic lying destroys the truthfulness of outcomes, making examination impossible because of corrupted data

B. The Drawbacks of Lying to the System [The benefits to individual
defendants]{.underline} (and to prosecutors in individual cases)
described above [comes at a cost to the broader criminal legal
system]{.underline}. The lack of transparency in the criminal system
means there is a mismatch between the system's inputs (the criminal laws
and procedures applicable to a defendant's criminal conduct) and its
outputs (the convictions and attendant punishments a defendant
receives). A combination of inputs should produce certain outputs. After
all, in any given jurisdiction, it is clear which criminal statutes and
associated sentencing schemes are available, even if, as I note in Part
I,153 the criminal procedure may vary significantly between
jurisdictions. It is also clear which state and federal collateral
consequences and other non-criminal penalties, such as immigration
consequences, mandatorily attach to a particular criminal conviction.154
Thus, although these are just some of the inputs that go into a plea
bargain,155 one would expect these inputs, when combined in a particular
way, to produce a specific output. But they simply do not. For instance,
an adult defendant charged with a felony sex crime should face only a
certain set of possible outcomes. The sentence will be defined by the
law. There will almost certainly be sex offender registration attached.
The defendant will have to pay the fines and fees associated with the
charge. Although there may be room for negotiation around the edges, the
law---in theory---demands a set of outcomes; however, [lying allows the
stakeholders to **manipulate** these inputs in ways hidden from public
view, **warping** them until one cannot even predict the output of a
felony sex crime]{.underline}. And by hiding these realities from view,
[[lying **inhibits** the **feedback loop** that would allow]{.mark}
[those outside]{.mark} the criminal system [to understand]{.mark} what
occurs within [the system]{.mark}]{.underline}. It does this by, on the
macro-level, [[making it **impossible** to collect]{.underline}]{.mark}
[meaningful [data]{.mark} [for systemic review]{.mark} [and]{.mark} on
the micro-level]{.underline}, [**[obscuring]{.mark}** the
[stories]{.mark} [of]{.mark} individual [defendants]{.mark} that might
shape the narrative around reform]{.underline}. In the end,
[[lying]{.mark} at plea bargaining [**distorts** our view]{.mark} [of
how and why the]{.mark} criminal [system punishes individuals
because]{.mark} [lying]{.mark} [alters]{.mark} [the]{.mark} fundamental
[input mechanics]{.mark} of the system [while]{.mark} also
[**concealing** the alterations]{.mark} themselves]{.underline}. To
illustrate, let us continue examining the felony sex crime example. In
the last few decades, every state and the federal system has adopted a
sex offender registry.156 In most places, sex offender registration is
now mandatory for felony sex offenses and many misdemeanor sex
offenses.157 Efforts to overturn these mandatory and harsh consequences
have been largely unsuccessful.158 As a result, when prosecutors choose
to charge sex offenses, they also put the defendant at risk for the
onerous burden of registration159 and often of some potential mandatory
sentence. But what happens when prosecutors, defense attorneys, or even
judges do not believe these penalties are appropriate, despite the
defendant having been correctly charged---given the factual
allegations---with a sex offense? As we saw in Part II.A, in these
instances, [stakeholders use fictional pleas to resolve non-registrable
felony convictions]{.underline}, or they [rely on fact bargaining to
avoid sex offender registration or mandatory minimums]{.underline}.160
The [stakeholders]{.underline} themselves [decide the just resolution in
the case]{.underline}, and this resolution only comes about through
lying because law otherwise formally prohibits it. As such, [by
resolving individual cases with such pleas, [legislatures and the public
are **denied**]{.mark} [an opportunity to examine]{.mark} [how]{.mark}
the sex offender [laws are]{.mark} [working because they **lack reliable
data**]{.mark} about what conduct criminal law covers [and miss
the]{.mark} [stories]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [those escaping]{.mark}
mandatory [punishments]{.mark} through the use of lying at plea
bargaining]{.underline}. These lies should alter how we think about the
use of convictions as markers of guilt. After all, these [lies
**distort**]{.underline} [efforts to study the criminal justice system
through **data**]{.underline}. The federal government, states, and
cities rely on data to drive criminal justice policy, legislation, and
reform.161 [Most conviction data is the result of plea bargains because
most convictions are the result of plea bargains]{.underline}. Lying at
plea bargaining calls into question the endeavor to study the criminal
justice system more systemically because so many of the measurables may
be inaccurate. Again, [[if]{.underline} [plea]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[bargaining transforms sex offenses into non-sex
offenses]{.underline}]{.mark} that do not represent the truth of what
the defendant did or did not do, then [attempts [to use those
convictions to measure]{.mark}]{.underline} either
[[crime]{.underline}]{.mark} or criminal justice outcomes [[are]{.mark}
**deeply [problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, although some
stories about defendants shine a light on the troubles with sex offender
registration,162 lying at plea bargaining indicates that many [more
defendants are diverted from registration through pleas based on lies.
Without knowing the intricacies of these lies, the public cannot
understand how or why those defendants benefited from a fictional plea
rather than a plea that requires registration]{.underline}. If there are
sympathetic stories (or unsympathetic stories as in the recent Jeffrey
Epstein case)163 that make sex offender registration not optimal for an
individual defendant, [the public and policymakers should hear those
stories to better understand whether sex offender registration is
working as intended]{.underline}. Otherwise, by using lies to avoid sex
offender registration, stakeholders deny policymakers the recorded data
points needed to determine the effectiveness of their policies. C. The
Paradox of Reform

#### Coerced innocent guilty pleas are considered truthful, meaning the government can punish you for perjury for arguing your innocence

How have our courthouses have become places of routine and systematic
lies? A courthouse is where we are supposed to find out the truth. It's
the place where people have to swear to tell the truth. In fact,
defendants swear an oath to tell the truth before the plea colloquy. We
make them swear to tell the truth right before we make them lie. What's
worse, when defendants try to expose the lies at the heart of plea
bargaining, they can actually be punished for it. Look at the case of
Michael Flynn, President Trump's former national security adviser, who
pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his telephone calls with the
Russian ambassador. After pleading guilty but before sentencing, Flynn
hired a new lawyer who challenged the government's case against him. The
new lawyer sought evidence from the FBI about its investigation, and she
used that new evidence and an affidavit from Flynn to argue that Flynn
should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because he wasn't
actually guilty. The Flynn case quickly turned into a circus because
President Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, abruptly filed a motion
to dismiss all of the charges against Flynn. That motion was one of
several actions that Barr took to undercut a special counsel's
investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential
election---actions that President Trump publicly encouraged from his
Twitter account and press statements. Largely ignored in the political
frenzy surrounding the Flynn case was the fact that the judge handling
the case contemplated holding Flynn in contempt for his affidavit in
support of withdrawing his guilty plea. In that affidavit, Flynn said
that he did not know that the statements he gave to the FBI were false
when he spoke to the FBI agents about his telephone calls with the
Russian ambassador. He wasn't lying, Flynn said. He just couldn't
remember what he'd talked about with the Russian ambassador. Because the
crime that Flynn pleaded guilty to required him to "knowingly" lie to
federal officials, the affidavit (a sworn written statement)
contradicted Flynn's sworn statement at his plea colloquy that he knew
that he was lying when he spoke to the FBI. The statement Flynn made
when pleading guilty and the statement he made to withdraw that plea
couldn't both be true---one of them had to be false---and so the judge
in his case made quite clear that he thought Flynn had committed
perjury. Perjury---lying under oath---is a crime. After reading through
the media coverage and the documents filed in the Flynn case, I am
unconvinced that Michael Flynn is actually innocent. The report by
special counsel Robert Mueller on Russian interference in the election
contains many references to interviews with Michael Flynn--- references
that contradict Flynn's later claims that he couldn't remember the
content of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Put bluntly, I
don't think Flynn is innocent, and I think President Trump's decision to
pardon him is one of several examples of the Trump administration
playing politics rather than seeking justice. But even though I don't
think Flynn is innocent, [I am deeply troubled by the idea that [a judge
would]{.mark} consider [punish]{.mark}ing [a]{.mark} [person for trying
to withdraw a guilty plea]{.mark} on the theory that he committed
**perjury**]{.underline}. There is no doubt that [innocent people
sometimes plead guilty]{.underline}. And [[if]{.mark} those
[people]{.mark} are lucky enough to uncover evidence that [proves their
innocence]{.mark} after they've pleaded guilty, [they should not
be]{.mark} [punished for **lying under oath**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many
[judges will not allow defendants to enter a guilty plea unless they
first say that they are guilty]{.underline}. So when [[innocent
defendants]{.underline}]{.mark} decide not to risk the additional
punishment associated with going to trial, they [[should not have to
worry about **perjury** charges]{.mark} [if they]{.mark} later
[find]{.mark} [evidence supporting their innocence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[They shouldn't be punished for lying because our system]{.underline}
not only [encourages]{.underline} that [lying]{.underline}; [it
sometimes requires it]{.underline}. University of Virginia law professor
Josh Bowers has a theory about why [we accept these lies associated with
plea bargaining but then react with horror when we hear that innocent
people plead guilty to crimes they didn't commit]{.underline}. Bowers
points out that [the criminal justice system accepts many lies. So long
as the defendant admits that she did "something wrong," then the system
is willing to tolerate those other lies]{.underline}. But, as Bowers
explains, the system "finds something sacrosanct and inviolable---even
magical---in the bottom-line accuracy of the defendant's admission that
she behaved (in some fashion) illegally." [We are comfortable with all
of those other lies as long as it is true that the defendant has done
something illegal]{.underline}. But [the very system that we created to
pressure guilty defendants to plead guilty creates a situation in which
innocent defendants]{.underline} [are]{.underline} actually sometimes
[better off pleading guilty than going to trial]{.underline}. It's this
pressure on innocent people and the proof that some innocent people have
pleaded guilty that are the most obvious examples of what is wrong with
criminal justice in America. Criminal justice reformers who criticize
plea bargaining often tell stories about innocent people who plead
guilty. I myself tell such a story---Damian Mills's---at the beginning
of this book. And it is no wonder why many criticisms of our criminal
justice system focus on innocent people who get convicted. Stories like
Damian's shock us. But we should be shocked by the system even when the
defendant is not innocent. That's because ours is still a bad system,
even when the people pleading guilty are, in fact, guilty. [It is a
system that not only abandons the search for truth but also
encourages---or even requires---lies.]{.underline} [All of those lies
obscure what is happening in the criminal justice system. We can't
evaluate the decisions that are being made by public officials and we
can't judge whether defendants are receiving the appropriate
punishment]{.underline}. This is why everyone should be outraged by
Mayor Bloomberg's lies about the Plaxico Burress case. We should be
outraged that we are being told that these heavy sentences are
absolutely necessary and that they are imposed on everyone---when the
truth is the precise opposite. \* \* \* \* \* \* That guilty defendants
are forced to lie during the plea colloquy is not the only problem with
a system that pressures guilty defendants to plead guilty. The system
also deprives those defendants of important rights---rights that
everyone has, regardless of whether they have committed a crime
