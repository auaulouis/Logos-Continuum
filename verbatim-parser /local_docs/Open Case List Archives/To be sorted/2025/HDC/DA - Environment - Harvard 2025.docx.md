What's Missing from the Conversation?

Little information is available about the environmental concerns that
icebreakers pose. Literature highlights the perceived
"positives"---scientific exploration, search and rescue, trade and
shipping, and competition amongst nations---as being more important than
considering environmental degradation. However, here's what we know.

**[[Icebreakers break ice]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[As]{.mark} the
[**broken ice melts**, **sunlight** is **absorbed**, leading to
increased **temperatures**, and **thus more ice
melting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. An [[icebreaker]{.mark} cruising
through]{.underline} [the ice for]{.underline} 1,000 kilometers ([620
miles]{.underline}), leaving an ice-free wake of ten meters (33 feet),
[[would open an area of water]{.mark} ten square kilometers]{.underline}
(**[[3.9 square miles]{.underline}]{.mark}**) over the entire cruise.
Although the Arctic Sea covers about 4,000 kilometers (2500 miles),
[[**any amount** of **ice breaking harms** the
**environment**]{.underline}. [With the **continual** use of
**icebreaker ships**, the **Arctic** will continue to look more like
**ice cubes melting** in a **glass of water**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[As **melting endures**]{.underline}, [we will continue to see
**environmental effects** around the world.]{.underline} C]{.mark}hanges
in the Arctic Sea ice pattern leads to a rise in sea levels globally.
Low-lying developed areas in the Gulf Coast and the mid-Atlantic regions
are especially at risk from sea-level rise. The recent growth of coastal
areas has resulted in larger populations and more valuable coastal
property being at risk from sea-level rise. Major physical impacts of a
rise in sea level include erosion of beaches, inundation of deltas as
well as flooding and loss of many marshes and wetlands. Increased
salinity will likely become a problem in coastal aquifers and estuarine
systems because of saltwater intrusion.

[[Changes in **Arctic ice patterns** are also **leading** to more
**frequent extreme weather**.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the past few
years, such extreme weather has been seen particularly across the east
coast of the USA, western Europe, and central Asia. These regions will
continue to experience more extreme weather because of Arctic
amplification, the enhanced sensitivity of high latitudes to global
heating. Arctic ice melt has also been shown to distort the flow of and
weaken the jet stream, resulting in more frequent periods of intense
heat and ferocious cold.

[There's also evidence that [the sound **emitted** from **icebreakers**
is **detrimental** to **marine animals**, particularly **whales** and
**other large mammals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The sound interferes with
their ability to communicate with their pods. Additionally, sound
pollution likely has long-term effects that are difficult to predict.

Summary

[**Decades** of **scientific investigation** convey **high confidence**
that **[human-induced]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[changes in the **climate
system**]{.underline},]{.mark} [largely [associated
with]{.mark}]{.underline} past and future [[**emissions**
of]{.underline} **[GHGs]{.underline}**,
[ar]{.underline}]{.mark}[e]{.underline} already [[having significant
**adverse effects** on the **environment** and]{.mark}, by **extension,
[human well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These effects are projected to
continue to manifest across a range of geographic scales (local to
global) and economic sectors. [[Effects will grow in **frequency**,
**intensity**, and **duration** in **response** to increases in future
**global average temperature**]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, what
constitutes a global catastrophic risk in the context of climate change
is poorly defined and contested. [Scientific
[studies]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}to date [[indicate a]{.underline}
[low, but not zero,]{.underline} [probability]{.underline} [that the
magnitudes of **climate change** currently]{.underline} [projected to
occur by **2050**]{.underline}]{.mark} [or **2100**]{.underline}
[[constitute a **global threat** to **civilization**]{.underline} [or
**continued human existence**]{.underline}.]{.mark} However,
[[catastrophic outcomes and]{.underline}]{.mark} [even [**existential
losses** of]{.mark} some **[human populations]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[ecosystems]{.underline}**, [and biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark} at
local to regional scales **[[are likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
particularly in the absence of risk management interventions.

From the assessment presented in this chapter, we see four key pathways
by which [**[climate change]{.underline}** [could trigger **global
catastrophe**:]{.underline}]{.mark}

• [[rapid acceleration in the use of **fossil fuel production** and
**use**:]{.underline}]{.mark} This [[could make]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**more-pessimistic** **scenarios** of **[future emissions
likelier]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [thus increasing the likelihood of
Earth **reaching magnitudes** of **global warming consistent** with
more-**catastrophic outcomes**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

• [[the Earth system's increased **sensitivity** to **changes in
climate**]{.underline}]{.mark}: Although current estimates put the world
on track for 2 to 3°C of warming by 2100 under current policy
trajectories, [[**positive feedback** could push the **world** to
**higher levels of warming**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

• reductions in thresholds for key risks in the Earth system: In the
event that large-scale discontinuities in the Earth system, such as the
collapse of ice sheets or major ecosystems, are triggered by lower
magnitudes of warming than currently estimated, the risk of global
catastrophic outcomes would increase.

• [cascading and compounded risks]{.underline}: [C[limate change's
ability to trigger complex]{.mark}]{.underline} [[consequences that are
not captured in existing]{.mark}, reductionist [studies could result in
**surprise catastrophic events** or **contribute** to **other types** of
**existential threats**, such as **global
pandemics**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Arctic to look like "**ice cubes** **melting** in a **glass of
water**"]{.underline}

Icebreakers play a crucial role in providing response capacity for
crises and disasters in ice-covered waters. They also improve the
capability of government marine safety agencies, and improve response to
environmental catastrophes like oil spills. Currently, international
flights cannot fly over the Arctic for lack of maritime rescue services,
something that could change if Russia expanded its investment in the
Arctic.

However, [the main purpose of the icebreakers is **simply to break
ice**]{.underline}. [Broken ice **melts** more **easily**, becoming
water that **absorbs more sunlight**. This causes an increase in **local
temperatures**, thus **leading to more ice melting.**]{.underline}

[The **Arctic is warming** much **faster** than the **rest of the
world** as the high sunlight **reflectivity**, or albedo, of **Arctic
ice is lost**]{.underline}. [Compared to ice, seawater absorbs **more
sunlight**, meaning that water then **warms up** and **evaporates** more
readily, itself becoming a **greenhouse gas**.]{.underline}

[**Small ships** can have **big effects** in the Arctic]{.underline}.
Non-profit US think tank the Center for the Advancement of the Steady
State Economy reported that an icebreaker ship passing through the ice
for around 620 miles, which leaves an ice-free wake of 33 feet, would
open an area of water of 3.9 square miles over the entire cruise.

Even though the Arctic Sea covers around 2,500 miles, **[all icebreaking
harms the environment.]{.underline}** Continuous use of icebreaker ships
in the Arctic would lead to looking more like "ice cubes melting in a
glass of water," the report says.

The lack of reciprocity in the economy of **[oil and gas
production]{.underline}** is obvious: the [mass-scale removal of
resources]{.underline} **[for export]{.underline}** [creates an
accumulation of financial]{.underline} [benefits far]{.underline} away
from the sites of their extraction, [enriching]{.underline} distant
shareholders, investment funds and **[oil CEOs]{.underline}**. But
[locally, these projects **pollute rivers**, **marine coastal**
**environments**, **landscapes** and the **air**]{.underline}. [An oil
spill in the Arctic would also **devastate ecosystems**]{.underline}
[and **Indigenous ways of life.**]{.underline} The impacts could be
irreversible, wiping out wildlife populations and destroying traditional
food systems and livelihoods.

[Marine mammals are]{.underline} particularly [undermined by **Arctic
extractivism**: they suffer]{.underline} [from **underwater
noise**]{.underline} [caused by]{.underline} an increasing number of
offshore **[seismic surveys]{.underline}** [and **growing shipping
traffic**]{.underline} [as the **sea ice melts** and makes the Arctic
Ocean easier to **navigate**]{.underline}. In fact, [the fossil fuel,
**mining** and **shipping industries** are the **biggest drivers** and
**beneficiaries** of ice melt in the Arctic]{.underline}. A 10-fold
increase in shipping traffic through the Northern Sea Route is expected
from now to 2035, and negative impacts on pristine and sensitive marine
and coastal environments will be unavoidable.

Given that the Arctic will only continue to attract more industrial
development in the years to come, it is important to find a balance
between creating jobs and protecting natural environments. To ensure a
healthy future for all, the Arctic economy needs to foster investments
in human capital, renewable energy and the sustainable blue economy and
apply ecosystem-based management. The agreement reached at the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties
(COP28) to transition away from fossil fuels---and triple renewable
energy capacity by 2030---is a good first step. [But ensuring that
governments step up and phase out fossil **fuels will be critical** to
the **Arctic's future**---and the **world's**.]{.underline}

As a concept, "**[extractivism]{.underline}**" has [gained attention
recently as **mining** and **mineral**]{.underline} **[exploration
companies eye frontiers]{.underline}** [that were once inaccessible: the
ocean]{.underline} [seabed]{.underline}, [the marine
offshore]{.underline}, areas of the **[high north]{.underline}** [and
more]{.underline}. Naomi Klein, the prominent Canadian environmental
author who wrote This Changes Everything---a book about the climate
crisis---describes extractivism as "a dominance-based relationship with
the earth" and connects it to what she calls sacrifice zones: "places
that, to their extractors, somehow don't count and can therefore be
poisoned, drained or otherwise destroyed."

The [fossil fuel projects across the Arctic region]{.underline}---in
Russia, Norway and Alaska (the US)---[are]{.underline} exactly that:
**[sacrifice zones]{.underline}**. Once extracted, [hydrocarbons are
exported over **long distances** for **use** in **other parts** of the
**world**,]{.underline} w[here they contribute to the increase of
**global carbon emissions** and **exacerbate the climate
crisis.**]{.underline} As discussed in a research brief recently
published by the WWF Global Arctic Programme, [this increasing interest
in Arctic fossil fuel production is completely out of touch with the
Paris Agreement to hold **global warming to 1.5°C or
less**]{.underline}. [By 2030, the volume of **fossil fuels** produced
in the **Arctic** will be **double** the **amount** that is **consistent
with that goal**. By 2050, the **gap may reach 700
percent**.]{.underline}

But [climate change is **not the only factor** behind Arctic

[The Arctic is warming]{.underline} many times faster than the global
average as anthropogenic carbon emissions intensify climate change and
ravage the Arctic environment. [Diminishing sea ice eliminates habitat
for seals and feeding opportunities for polar bears]{.underline}.
Increasing rain-on-snow events---when rain freezes as a crust on top of

and muskox from finding food. Warming water temperatures harm salmon in
rivers like the Yukon and Kuskokwim. [Thawing permafrost impacts
wildlife habitats while intensifying wildfires wreck forests and

[As political and economic interest in the Arctic

kinds** through **pollution**, **underwater noise**, **vessel strikes**,
and **oil spills**]{.underline}.

It's a multi-pronged problem with numerous consequences.

[Arctic biodiversity supports **economic engines** of local, regional,
and global importance.]{.underline} Local economies, and especially
Indigenous communities, rely heavily on the harvests of fish, marine
mammals, berries, birds, and more. Fisheries in Arctic and near-Arctic
waters support thousands of jobs and fill grocery stores around the
world. [Tourism is]{.underline} also [growing in the

and gas **[exploration]{.underline}**, **[marine mining]{.underline}**,

[The polar region is also a repository for chemicals and heavy metals

pollute the pole: microplastics, pesticides, "forever chemicals," PFAS,
PCBs, mercury, and other persistent toxic substances]{.underline}. Many
[contaminants have serious health impacts, disrupting brain function,
causing cancer, and interfering with reproduction.]{.underline}

In the long term, some Arctic species will succeed better than others.
Rolf Ims notes that "winners" in this ecosystem shuffle will likely be
generalist species that are able to cope with a wider climatic niche,
colonize new areas, or adjust to new circumstances.

But, [as climate change and other **environmental problems escalate**,
**immense uncertainty remains**]{.underline} [even for those animals

While often considered remote, [the Arctic **plays** a **large role** in
the **functioning** of many **global environmental
systems**]{.underline} (Post et al. 2019; Timmermans and Marshall 2020).
**[In particular]{.underline}**, [the Arctic is involved with the
**regulation** of **global climate**]{.underline} (McGuire et al. 2006)
[with important **implications** for the **ongoing climate
crisis**]{.underline} (Díaz et al. 2019[). While the Arctic may hold
less **biodiversity** than other **biomes**, this biome\'s
**biodiversity** is **unique**]{.underline} [in that it
includes]{.underline} more than 21 000 known [species]{.underline} of
fungi, plants, and animals [that are highly adapted to life in the cold
and in some cases **could not survive without it**]{.underline} (see
Fig. 1; Callaghan et al. 2004; Payer et al. 2013; Ruth et al. 2023).
These adaptations come in many forms. For example, Arctic plants and
microorganisms have traits that make them tolerant to freezing, and
Arctic animals have developed various mechanisms such as fat storage
that allow them to tolerate frigid temperatures (Callaghan et al. 2004;
Guerrero and Rogers 2019). On a global scale, the Arctic is home to 27%
of the world\'s marine mammal species (Payer et al. 2013) and more than
20% of the world\'s lichenicolous fungi species (i.e., fungi that live
on lichens; Dahlberg and Bültmann 2013; Payer et al. 2013). The Arctic
also provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds that migrate to
the Arctic from around the globe to breed and forage (Sullender 2019).
There is even diversity within Arctic sea ice where numerous bacteria,
viruses, algae, and sea ice infauna (e.g., ciliates, nematodes,
turbellarians, crustaceans) reside (Bluhm et al. 2011; Patrohay et al.
2022).

Nature Positive by 2030 **[The Arctic's unique ecosystems]{.underline}**
and wildlife **[are under pressure]{.underline}**. On the cusp of a
renewal of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity's 10-year strategy,
Martin Sommerkorn and Melanie Lancaster say it's important to identify
what can and should be achieved in the Arctic in the next decade to
benefit nature and people. Is it all that different from what needs to
be done elsewhere? Ten years is a long time in a region experiencing
rapid transformative change. From 2011 to 2020---the lifespan of the
last Strategic Plan for Biodiversity that was agreed to under the UN
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)---nature and people in the
Arctic experienced many firsts. For example, in 2016, residents of the
Alaskan coastal village of Shishmaref voted to relocate because the
effects of the climate crisis were causing buildings to slide into the
sea. In 2018, a sperm whale surfaced in the waters of Canada's High
Arctic, far north of its normal range, surprising local people and
researchers alike. And in 2019, an extraordinary number of salmon
running in the rivers of Wrangel Island off Russia became snacks for
hungry polar bears. Last summer, an unprecedented number of intense,
long-lasting wildfires burned across the Arctic Circle as temperatures
hit record highs. The frigid waters of the Barents Sea became more
hospitable to southern fish species, which replaced Arctic ones. And in
each of the last five years, annual Arctic surface temperatures have
exceeded those of any year since 1900. ...And that was just the
beginning [[Last year's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate
Change]{.underline}](https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/features/special-ipcc-report-on-the-oceans-and-cryosphere/)
was unequivocal in stating that trends like these will intensify in the
coming decades, with grave impacts for Arctic habitats, species and
ecosystems. Protecting habitats effectively and stemming their
loss---cornerstones of past (and likely future) CBD strategies---will be
virtually impossible for Arctic states without strong climate action on
a global scale, and possibly even with it. Take summer sea ice extent,
for example, currently shrinking at a rate of approximately 13 per cent
per decade. **[The sea ice ecosystem provides habitat for unique Arctic
species]{.underline}**, from algae and fish to polar bears and walrus.
**[Arctic tundra]{.underline}** is another example: its area **[is
forecast to halve by 2050]{.underline}**. This trend may drive
barren-ground caribou, or wild reindeer---whose numbers have already
declined by 60 per cent in the past two decades---beyond their ability
to adapt. These and other impacts will deeply affect the benefits people
receive from nature, ranging from food security to cultural survival.
Proactive efforts could be cause for hope **[In many ways, the Arctic
has a head start compared with other regions of the world]{.underline}**
when it comes to efforts to be Nature Positive by 2030: **[numerous
Arctic species are in good shape]{.underline}** **[because many of the
region's habitats and ecosystems are still largely
intact.]{.underline}** **[Rather than beginning with efforts to restore
nature]{.underline}**, **[we have an opportunity to]{.underline}** be
proactive and **[focus on supporting its inherent resilience and ability
to adapt.]{.underline}** But Arctic states still need to prepare for the
growing challenges of climate change, industrial development, and the
loss and fragmentation of habitats in a systematic, co-operative
fashion. **[Planning and management must]{.underline}** include the
participation of Arctic Indigenous Peoples to **[ensure that nature is
managed in a way that strengthens current and future food security,

**[caused]{.underline}** a [global collapse **knowingly**]{.underline}
and whilst documenting it- The predicted 30-year time horizon should
shake humanity's collective complacency. 'It won\'t happen in my

current rate of personal or societal contributions to climate change.

The **[collapse]{.underline}** of global civilisation [is **not
inevitable**]{.underline}, but [all of us need to act
**quickly**]{.underline} and decisively [to avoid breaching]{.underline}
the **[1.5^o^C threshold]{.underline}** identified by the IPCC. Manmade
carbon dioxide emissions need to halve by 2030 compared with 2010 levels
and reach net zero by 2050 to limit global heating 1.5^o^C, or 45% by
2030 and reach net zero by 2070 to remain 2^o^C. Net zero does not
mandate cessation of manmade carbon dioxide emissions, merely that they
occur at the same rate as their \'draw down' (removal) from the
atmosphere. Many have called for radical decarbonisation and further
research. Radical [**decarbonisation** needs to proceed
**urgently**]{.underline} according to actions based on current
knowledge and informed opinion. Certainly, research should be performed
(e.g. into carbon capture and storage technologies) but should not delay
immediate action to reduce emissions. However, we cannot wait for
certainty, or rely on innovation and technology to engineer us out of
imminent climate collapse. Even if the IPCC 1.5^o^C and 2^o^C target
horizons remain valid, we will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by over 10% year-on-year to 2030 (i.e. approximately double the 5.4%
annual emissions reduction measured during the COVID-19 pandemic
'anthropause' of 2020).

There are four reasons why **[the Arctic Ocean is]{.underline}**
distinct from other oceans and **[critical to our planet's
survival]{.underline}**: First, while this relatively small (by ocean
standards) marine environment holds only 1% of the world's ocean volume
and occupies only 3% of the world's ocean surface area, **[its impact on
the global climate]{.underline}** system **[is disproportionately
large]{.underline}**. Second, though small in area, it scoops up over
10% of global river runoff and claims twenty of the world's 100 longest
rivers. Third, the Arctic marine domain comprises about a third of the
world's coastline. And fourth, the Arctic Ocean contains one-quarter of
the world's continental shelf, of immense socio-ecological importance.
On all counts, the little Arctic Ocean holds its own on the global
stage. Despite its importance, the Arctic Ocean sometimes goes missing
from public ocean-talk as more 'local' marine issues take centre stage.
A key point for non-experts is to recognize that **[the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}** is different from other oceans and it **[is the
critical driver of the global oceanic conveyor belt]{.underline}**. For
example, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current are strongly
regulated by processes that occur in the Arctic. The Arctic Ocean is
remote to many of us, but its influence can be felt everywhere. How do
we know this? **[Oceanographers have robust scientific evidence on the
role the Arctic plays]{.underline}** within our planet. For instance,
the global hydrological cycle determines the distribution of water
around the planet -- and affects food and water security globally. This
cycle begins in warmer climates, with the equatorial trade winds and
mid-latitude westerlies. It is refined and shaped by the global
distribution of land masses that, in the northern hemisphere, collect
precipitation and direct it poleward through massive rivers. These
rivers introduce substantial amounts of fresh water into the upper
layers of the Arctic Ocean, providing the required conditions for an ice
cover to form, and regulating nutrient supplies and biological
productivity. But these dynamics are undergoing unprecedented and
worrying changes that are already visible. [[Jonathan
Smith]{.underline}](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1rwh0b4t8XzzlDz7tlgpZrj/filming-walrus-in-the-arctic),
producer of Blue Planet II, reflected on the new realities of filming in
the Arctic Ocean: "We were all set and ready to film but we needed two
major things -- walrus and ice. I had expected that walrus may be hard
to find, but I did not expect it to be hard to find ice in the
Arctic.... the crew were all commenting how surprisingly warm it was."
They were not mistaken. Over many years, scientists have been recording
changes in global temperature, hydrological cycles and sea-ice cover.
These changes have all had significant and eminently observable effects
on the Arctic Ocean. Over the past two decades alone, summer sea-ice
coverage in the Arctic Ocean has decreased by about seven million square
kilometres to just over 3 million square kilometres. This loss
represents a surface area larger than all but about a dozen countries in
the world. However, **[the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}** is not just a
passive victim of anthropogenic change: it also **[drives disruptions
back to the global system]{.underline}** in ways that were overlooked
even a decade ago. Though the exact mechanisms are still debated, Arctic
sea-ice loss may be affecting both ocean currents and [[mid-latitude
weather
patterns]{.underline}](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/arctic-melting-beast-from-the-east-why-we-should-be-worried)
along our southern borders. And the processes occurring in the Arctic
play a vital role in connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic. The fabled
Northwest Passage is more than a destination for explorers and
commercial ship traffic; the Arctic is an oceanographic freight train
that ties together and influences other maritime regions and the global
climate system. Worryingly there are big changes in Arctic [[sea-ice
cover]{.underline}](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/the-arctic-has-just-experienced-the-warmest-winter-on-record/),
freshwater supply, nutrient availability and the underwater light
climate which are taking place at an accelerated pace, with associated
shifts in seawater chemistry and biological activity, and **[alterations
to habitat and food-web structure]{.underline}** that are
**[affect]{.underline}**ing **[the entire ocean]{.underline}**. Ocean
waters are growing more acidic, and oxygen concentrations have decreased
by nearly 8% over the past 50 years alone. From this perspective, it
seems inevitable that the ongoing and **[rapid changes in the physical
environment of the marine Arctic will push]{.underline}** existing
socio-ecological **[systems]{.underline}** - small and large - **[beyond
tipping points]{.underline}** and into new regimes. What this means is
that temperature, pH and oxygen **[changes lead to species
extinctions]{.underline}**, **[threatening fisheries and food
security.]{.underline}** In addition, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration recently issued a new report card on the
health of the Arctic ocean, which conlduded: "The [[report
card]{.underline}](https://eos.org/articles/arctic-undergoing-most-unprecedented-transition-in-human-history?utm_source=eos&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=EosBuzz121518)
calls marine
[[microplastics]{.underline}](https://eos.org/articles/mounting-litter-spotted-on-arctic-seafloor)
an 'emerging threat' in the Arctic, and it notes that a recent global
survey shows that the Arctic Ocean has higher concentrations of
microplastics than any other ocean basin in the world." When German
scientists found 11,000 particles of microplastic in one litre of melted
sea ice from the remote Arctic, everyone began to understand how
widespread and serious this is. Unbelievable as it may sound, the
plastic soup has now reached Arctic waters. Now, more than ever, it is
imperative to close the gap between our newfound knowledge of the
rapidly changing Arctic Ocean and the corresponding development of new
ideas and innovative policies from the public and private sectors to
ensure the ocean's long-term sustainable use and resilience. **[The
Arctic Ocean has given us a screaming wake-up call]{.underline}** --
what goes on 'up in the north' comes with a high cost to societies
around the world, and **[the Arctic and its Ocean are a key barometer of
global risk.]{.underline}** It\'s time for us to listen.

A rounded bow allows for more efficient icebreaking and helps lift the
vessel up under pressure from ice. Broken ice is also directed under the
icebreaker through air and water systems. These and other measures
prevent broken ice from building up around the front of the ship and,
therefore, from slowing it down. [It is also important to stress that
icebreakers traverse ice-laden waters by **breaking ice**, **not by

Our results suggest that climate change impacts on Arctic sea-ice
thickness will increase [Arctic offshore oil production]{.underline},
though with that impact alone, it [is likely to remain a **small
portion** of **total global oil production**]{.underline}. [The climate
impacts on Arctic]{.underline} sea [ice on offshore natural gas
extraction are **likely to be limited**]{.underline}, [with production
remaining low due to the very low relative costs of onshore natural gas
extraction elsewhere in the world]{.underline}. Among Arctic regions,
changes in sea ice thickness are likely to have the largest impacts on
USA Arctic offshore oil production, particularly for the Alaskan
Platform AU. We find the effects of human efforts to achieve a
low-carbon future (LowC scenarios) would increase Arctic offshore oil
production, due to the simultaneous effect of reduction in
unconventional oil production and the gradual depletion of non-Arctic
crude oil over the century. [Nevertheless, in the near term]{.underline}
(before 2030), [neither the effects of climate change-induced sea ice
thinning nor low-carbon transition scenarios are likely to cause
expansion of Arctic offshore oil production into new AUs]{.underline}.

Can you [explain]{.underline} what [the mechanism]{.underline} is
[whereby **biodiversity loss** creates existential risk?]{.underline}
And if biodiversity loss is an existential risk, how big a risk is it?
Should 80k be getting people to go into conservation science or not?

There are independent reasons to think that the risk is negligible.
Firstly, according to wikipedia, [during the Eocene period]{.underline}
\~65m years ago, [there were **thousands fewer genera** than
today]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} have [made **\~1%** of species
extinct, and we would have to continue]{.underline} at [**current rates
of species extinctions** for **at least 200 years** to return to
**Eocene levels of biodiversity**]{.underline}. And yet, even though
significantly warmer than today, [the Eocene marked the dawn of
thousands of new species]{.underline}. So, [**why** would]{.underline}
we expect [the world 200 years hence]{.underline} to [be **inhospitable
to humans** if it **wasn\'t inhospitable** for]{.underline} all of the
[species]{.underline} emerging [in **the Eocene**, who]{.underline}
are/[were **significantly less numerous** than humans and
**significantly less capable** of a **rational response to
problems?**]{.underline}

Secondly, as far as I am aware, [evidence for]{.underline}
pressure-induced [non-linear ecosystem shifts is **very
limited**]{.underline}. This is true for a range of ecosystems. Linear
ecosystem damage seems to be the norm. If so, [this leaves **more
scope** for learning **about the costs** of our damage to ecosystems and
correcting any **damage we have done**]{.underline}.

Thirdly, [ecosystem services are]{.underline} overwhelmingly [a
function]{.underline} of the relations [within **local** ecosystems,
rather than of **global**]{.underline} trends in
[biodiversity]{.underline}. Upon discovering Hawaii, the Polynesians
eliminated so many species that global decadal extinction rates would
have been exceptional. This has next to no bearing on ecosystem services
outside Hawaii. [Humanity]{.underline} is an intelligent species and
[will be able to see]{.underline} if [other regions]{.underline} are
[suffering from biodiversity loss and **make adjustments
accordingly**]{.underline}. Why would all regions be so stupid as to
ignore lessons from elsewhere? Also, is biodiversity actually decreasing
in the rich world? I know forest cover is increasing in many places.
Population is set to decline in many rich countries in the near future,
and environmental impact per person is declining on many metrics.

The ECS of the CMIP6 GCMs ranges between 1.8 °C and 5.7 °C, but the
[**IPCC AR6** acknowledged]{.underline} the [existence of a]{.underline}
"**[hot]{.underline}**" **[model problem]{.underline}** and
[claimed]{.underline} that [the **actual ECS**]{.underline} may [likely
range between 2.5 °C and 4.0 °C]{.underline}, [with a **best estimate**
of around 3.0 °C]{.underline} (Sherwood et al., 2020, Hausfather et al.,
2022). However, [**recent research** suggests]{.underline} that the
[expected ECS range should vary within **lower values** between 1.5 °C
and 3 °C]{.underline} (Nijsse et al., 2020, Scafetta, 2022, Scafetta,
2023a, Lewis, 2023, Spencer and Christy, 2023). Furthermore, [according
to a **number of empirical studies**]{.underline}, the [**actual ECS
values** could]{.underline} even [be **significantly
lower**]{.underline}, [ranging between 1 °C and 2 °C]{.underline}
(Lindzen and Choi, 2011, Scafetta, 2013, Scafetta, 2023c, Bates, 2016,
McKitrick and Christy, 2020, Stefani, 2021).

The IPCC AR6 investigates a range of SSP scenarios for the 21st-century
without assigning a probability to their plausibility. In any case,
despite the [**questionable visibility** given to SSP5-8.5]{.underline}
([the **worst-case scenario**]{.underline}), which [yields
the]{.underline} largest and [**most alarming** projected global warming
of up to 4--8 °C]{.underline} (66%) by 2080--2100, table 12.12 of the
[IPCC AR6]{.underline} (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021, p. 1856)
[**already reports** for the **entire 21st century** low confidence in
the **direction of any change** in the frequency]{.underline}, [severity
or extent of frost]{.underline}, [river floods]{.underline},
[landslides]{.underline}, [aridity]{.underline}, [hydrological
drought]{.underline}, **[agricultural and ecological
drought]{.underline}**, **[fire weather]{.underline}**, [mean wind
speed]{.underline}, [severe wind storms]{.underline}, [tropical
cyclones]{.underline}, [sand and dust storms]{.underline}, [heavy
snowfall and **ice storms**]{.underline}, [hail]{.underline}, [snow
avalanche]{.underline}, [coastal floods]{.underline}, [coastal
erosion]{.underline}, [marine heatwaves]{.underline}, [**air pollution
weather** or **radiation** at earth's surface]{.underline}. Medium and
high confidence of changes are mostly expected in climatic impact-driver
types more directly associated with increasing atmospheric CO2
concentration at surface and global warming such as increasing mean air
temperature, extreme heat, sea level, mean ocean temperature, ocean
salinity and ocean acidity; with decreasing cold spell, snow, glacier
and ice sheet, permafrost, lake, river and sea ice, and dissolved
oxygen; mean precipitation will increase in some regions and decrease in
others.

However, [**recent research** argued]{.underline} that [the
alarmistic]{.underline} SSP3-7.0 and [**SSP5-8.5 scenarios**
are]{.underline} likely and **[very likely unrealistic]{.underline}**,
respectively (Burgess et al., 2020, Hausfather and Peters, 2020, Pielke
and Ritchie, 2021a). These studies indicate that the radiative forcing
functions derived from the [SSP2-4.5]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} even
[SSP2-3.4]{.underline}) scenario [are the **most
plausible**]{.underline}. The SSP2-4.5 is a moderate scenario; it
[projects]{.underline} about [**half of the 21st-century warming** than
what the SSP5-8.5 scenario does]{.underline} (Fig. 1) and is thus far
less alarming.

With the aforementioned factors in mind, it was proposed here to use
only the SSP2-4.5 scenario and the GCMs with ECS ≤ 3 °C to [**more
precisely** assess]{.underline} "**[realistic]{.underline}**" [global
and regional impacts and risks]{.underline} that could be [associated
with climate changes]{.underline} that are [expected to occur in the
21st century]{.underline}, and to compare them with the Paris Agreement
warming target of keeping global surface temperature \< 2 °C above the
pre-industrial levels throughout the 21st century. [To **optimize the
result**]{.underline} even more, the [simulation ensembles
containing]{.underline} the [low]{.underline}, [medium]{.underline},
[and high-ECS macro-GCMs were **linearly scaled** to **best reflect**
the **real global surface warming**]{.underline} recorded from
1980--1990 to 2012--2022.

According to the IPCC, if there is little-to-no adaptation, the impacts
and risks of projected climate change will be moderate-high (orange-red
flag) by 2040--2060, and the situation might worsen considerably by 2100
even if the SSP2-4.5 moderate scenario is implemented. In fact,
according to the analysis reported in Table 3, the GCMs within the
IPCC's preferred ECS range of 2.5--4.0 °C project a warming of
1.98--3.82 °C by 2080--2100. Thus, the IPCC (Masson-Delmotte et al.,
2018) analysis suggests that only net-zero-emission scenarios like the
SSP1-2.6 (which could produce a warming of 1.26--2.82 °C by 2080--2100)
should be adopted to avoid too dangerous climatic changes, which are
expected to begin if global surface temperatures rise more than 2--2.5
°C above the 1850--1900 level in a few decades (Gao et al., 2017, Tol,
2015). Climate-change alarmism and world-wide proposals for prompt
implementations of net-zero emission policies are only based on such
claims.

However, using only the low-ECS models (ECS ≤ 3.0 °C) and the SSP2-4.5
scenario, Table 3 suggests that [**global warming** in the 21st century
will be **moderate**]{.underline}, [ranging from 1.36 °C to 2.25
°C]{.underline} (median 1.77 °C) [by 2050 and from 1.96 °C to 2.83
°C]{.underline} (median 2.28 °C) [by 2080--2100]{.underline}, which
partially overlaps with the upper warmer half of the climate projection
obtained using the SSP1-2.6 scenario and the GCMs with ECS of 2.5--4.0
°C. Thus, [climate change impacts and risks will worsen by the end of
the 21st-century]{.underline}, albeit [at a **slower rate** than
**predicted by the IPCC**]{.underline} using the same SSP2-4.5 scenario.
As a result, the SSP2-4.5 scenario, which is moderate and affordable,
may be close enough to roughly meet the Paris Agreement warming target,
whereas the SSP2-3.4 scenario, which could be even more realistic
(Pielke et al., 2022), should even more likely fully meet it.

I also proposed an alternative methodology for estimating "realistic"
21st-century climate projections and assessing their respective impacts
and risks. In fact, the [low-ECS macro-GCM]{.underline} appears to be
slightly [**warmer** than global surface temperature
records]{.underline} and there are serious concerns about the
reliability of the global surface temperature records, which cannot be
ignored. In fact, their [warming]{.underline} appears to be
[**excessive** in comparison to **alternative temperature
records**]{.underline}, [such as **satellite-based** ones]{.underline}
relative to the lower troposphere (Spencer et al., 2017, Zou et al.,
2023), [and]{.underline} there are [**various evidences** suggesting
their **contamination** from urban heat islands and other **non-climatic
surface factors**]{.underline} (Connolly et al., 2021, Scafetta, 2021a,
Scafetta, 2023b, Soon et al., 2023, Spencer, 2023). There are also
concerns regarding the ability of the GCMs to properly reconstruct
decadal to millennial natural climate oscillations (e.g.: Scafetta,
2013, Scafetta, 2021b, Scafetta, 2023c). As a result, [**all GCMs** may
be **grossly inadequate** for estimating climate change in the 21st
century]{.underline}, as also McKitrick and Christy (2020) concluded.
Thus, the models likely need to be corrected and upgraded with new
relevant physical mechanisms. It is possible to agree with McCarthy and
Caesar (2023) who recently showed the inability of the CMIP5 and CMIP6
GCMs in properly hindcasting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation and concluded "if these models cannot reproduce past
variations, why should we be so confident about their ability to predict
the future?".

To address the above issues, I have proposed an **[alternative
methodology]{.underline}** that [uses **empirical modifications** of the
**actual GCM projection ensembles** via **appropriate linear
scaling**]{.underline} in such a way [to simulate]{.underline} the
[outputs of **hypothetical climate models** that could **accurately
represent** the warming observed from 1980 to 2022]{.underline}. The
1980--2022 period was selected because it is covered by a variety of
temperature records with low statistical errors. This methodology would
essentially simulate hypothetical GCMs that are supposed to optimally
reproduce the data. Simple testing validates the proposed methodology
because scaling the projection ensembles of the three macro-GCMs to a
similar level from 1080--1990 to 2011--2022 results in projection
ensembles that approximately overlap throughout the 21st century.

The proposed methodology may also be justified by considering that the
GCMs are extremely sensitive to small modifications of their internal
free parameters, in particular to those regarding cloud formation, and
even GCM modelers adopt complex tuning approaches to explicitly
calibrating them to better match historical data (Mauritsen and
Roeckner, 2020, Mignot et al., 2021). Section 4 proposes and
investigates several of these modeling approaches, the results of which
are depicted in Fig. 5, Fig. 7.

If the warming of the HadCRUT5 record from 1980 to 1990--2011--2022 is
assumed correct, it is found that the SSP2-4.5 scenario produces climate
projections similar to those produced by the low-ECS macro-GCM. In fact,
the projected warming ranged from 1.65 °C to 3.03 °C by 2080--2100, with
a median of 2.28 °C (Table 4, case #1). This conclusion is unsurprising
given that the low-ECS macro-GCM has already successfully recreated the
HadCRUT5 warming.

However, if the reference warming is that reported by lower troposphere
satellite temperature data (Spencer et al., 2017, Zou et al., 2023), the
warming of the low-ECS macro-GCM simulations must be lowered by about
30%. As a result, global warming by 2080--2100 is projected to range
from 1.18 °C to 2.16 °C (median 1.63 °C) above pre-industrial levels
using the SSP2-4.5 scenario (Table 4, case #2), which is well below the
(safe) threshold of 2.0 °C and is even cooler than the 1.26--2.82 °C
estimate obtained with the GCMs with ECS within the IPCC likely range of
2.5 °C and 4.0 °C using the SSP1-2.6 net-zero emission scenario.

A similar result was obtained with an empirical climate model that
assumes that the global surface temperature record is sufficiently
accurate, but also takes into account temperature changes caused by
empirically identified large climate cycles and/or solar effects that
the CMIP6 GCMs do not replicate (Scafetta, 2010, Scafetta, 2013,
Scafetta, 2021b); this case projects a warming ranging from 1.15 °C to
2.52 °C with median 1.78 °C by 2080--2100 (Table 4, case #3).
Unfortunately, the IPCC ignores such semi-empirical modeling of the
climate system although it has been developed and discussed in the
scientific literature, and it should not be dismissed lightly given that
the GCMs fail to reproduce the natural oscillations observed throughout
the Holocene. They do not, for example, reproduce any of the Holocene
warm periods, such as the Roman and Medieval warm periods, which
indicate a quasi-millennial oscillation, a quasi-60-year oscillation,
and many other natural climate oscillations. Also this kind of empirical
modeling predicts very modest ECS values, ranging at least between 1 and
3 °C, but more likely between 1 °C and 2 °C (Lindzen and Choi, 2011,
Scafetta, 2013, Scafetta, 2021b, Scafetta, 2023c, Bates, 2016, Stefani,
2021).

In conclusion, as Hausfather and Peters (2020) pointed out, it is past
time to stop treating the worst-case climate change scenarios (e.g.,
SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) as the most likely outcomes, because only
realistic and pragmatic scenarios, such as SSP2-4.5 or SSP2-3.4, can
lead to sound policies that can be accepted by all nations. Furthermore,
net-zero scenarios such as SSP1-2.6 look to be equally unattainable, as
the depletion of crucial metals required for low-carbon solar and wind
technologies, as well as electric vehicles and their chargers, appears
to make low-carbon technology production impossible on the very large
scale required to substitute fossil fuels (Groves et al., 2023). In
fact, despite the IPCC AR6 reports are rather alarming because global
surface temperatures were projected to rise by up to 4--8 °C above
pre-industrial levels according to unrealistic shared socioeconomic
pathways (see Fig. 1 and Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021), with
catastrophic consequences in many situations (Pörtner et al., 2022),
Fig. 5, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show that "**[realistic]{.underline}**" [climate
change impacts and risks for the 21st century will likely be **much more
moderate** than what the IPCC claims]{.underline}. This is because there
is a [growing **body of evidence**]{.underline} that [the **actual ECS**
may be rather low]{.underline} (1.5--3.0 °C, or even 1--2 °C) [for a
variety of reasons]{.underline} derived from direct CMIP6 GCM
assessments, [likely **warming biases** affecting global surface
temperature records]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} a (likely solar
induced) [**natural variability** that the **current climate models** do
not reproduce]{.underline}. According to the semi-empirical climate
modeling proposed above, the climate system will likely warm by less
than 2.0--2.5 °C by 2080--2100, and on average less than 2.0 °C, also if
the moderate SSP2-4.5 scenario is implemented. As a result, rapid
decarbonization and net-zero emission scenarios such as the SSP1-2.6 are
shown to be unnecessary to maintain global surface temperature \< 2 °C
throughout the 21st century.

Fig. 9 employs the climate "thermometer" proposed by Climate Action
Tracker (2022) to summarize the above findings by contrasting the
projections derived from the IPCC climate assumptions, where only the
SSP1-2.6 net-zero emission scenario could satisfy the 2.0 °C target,
with the new proposed assessments of "realistic" global warming impacts
and risks obtained using the three semi-empirical models discussed above
with the pragmatic SSP2-4.5 scenario that approximately agrees with the
real world action based on current policies (Tables 3B and 4).

As a result, despite predictions that the climate system would continue
to warm throughout the 21st century, [there is **no compelling
evidence** of an **impending global disaster** caused by manmade
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}. The 2.0 °C Paris-agreement
warming target for the 21st century can likely be met even under the
feasible and moderate SSP2-4.5 emission scenario because future climate
change is expected to be modest enough that any potential related
hazards can be addressed efficiently through effective and low-cost
adaptation strategies, without the need for implementing rapid,
expensive, and technologically likely impossible net-zero
decarbonization policies.

Freshwater [biodiversity loss is]{.underline} a **[global

loss]{.underline}** and **[degradation]{.underline}**, **[invasive
species]{.underline}**, **[overexploitation]{.underline}**, and
**[changes to water flow]{.underline}** (Dudgeon et al. 2006; Reid et
al. 2019). Changes to freshwater hydrology via [climate change will
**exacerbate these issues**]{.underline}. [Some of the impacts climate
change is anticipated to have on freshwater hydrology in the
Arctic]{.underline} include an increase of [precipitation and severe
weather events, drought, earlier snowmelt and later snowfall, and an
increase in water temperatures]{.underline} (Wrona et al. 2004; CAFF
2013b). These impacts in turn are expected to alter hydrological and
climate systems exacerbating the issue (Prowse et al. 2015). [Changes to
permafrost are also expected to greatly influence freshwater
hydrology]{.underline}, though how is unclear (Walvoord and Kurylyk
2016). **[Some of these effects are already being
observed]{.underline}** (Smol and Douglas 2007; Hansen et al. 2014),
which is especially concerning given that freshwater ecosystems are
important in the Arctic, acting as a link between marine and terrestrial
ecosystems, supporting high biodiversity that local communities depend
on for their livelihoods (see Fig. 4; Wrona and Reist 2013). [Given this
connection, horizon scan participants recommended that an ideal way to
mitigate the barriers of limited access to research sites and resources
would be to work with local communities for data collection]{.underline}
(see Table 1). With these data, remote sensing applications could then
be developed (see Table 1).

### 1AR\-\--No Link\-\--Icebreakers

#### Even if massively scaled up, icebreakers would have a [miniscule]{.underline} impact on the climate.

[How much ice does an icebreaker break?]{.underline}

Meier decided to crunch some numbers and find out. While his numbers are
an estimate, they provide a helpful comparison of just how much
icebreakers might contribute to summer ice loss. Meier said, "In late
June, when the sun's energy is strongest, the total sea ice extent is
around 10 million square kilometers (3.9 million square miles). An
icebreaker cruising through the ice for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and
leaving an ice-free wake of 10 meters (33 feet) would open an area of
water 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) over the entire cruise. In
contrast, the Arctic sea ice cover decreases by an average of over 9
million square kilometers (3.5 million square miles) each year during
its melt season---an area larger than the contiguous United States.

[Even as **icebreaker activity increases**]{.underline}---for example,
Russia maintains the world's largest fleet of more than 50 icebreakers
in 2023 compared with fewer than 10 icebreakers a decade ago---[these
numbers **do not significantly change**]{.underline}. Many of Russia's
icebreakers are being used to escort ships through the Northern Sea
Route, and they tend to follow the same channel. This means that even
though there may be multiple icebreakers operating at the same time,
they are not breaking much new ice, which would only occur if the ice
drifted and blocked the channel. So, Meier said, "[The actual
contribution is miniscule---only **one part in a million**]{.underline}
[of the **total ice cover**."]{.underline}

[Even if the amount of ice broken **increased** by an **order of
magnitude**]{.underline}, [say from 10 square kilometers]{.underline}
(3.86 square miles) [of ice broken by a single icebreaker to **100**
**square kilometers**]{.underline} (38.61 square miles) [of ice broken
by **10 icebreakers**]{.underline}, [the amount of ice broken would
still be **minuscule** compared to the **vastness of the Arctic
Ocean.**]{.underline} [Because icebreakers have such a **minimal
effect** on **sea ice**, they also have a **minimal effect on
climate**.]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\--No Link\-\--Drilling

#### Oil and gas extraction in the Arctic is not economical.

industry's cynical gamble on Arctic drilling.\" Vox. 9-8-2023.

HDCSW-Packet

But [these advantages]{.underline} also [run up against major
barriers]{.underline} [that make oil development in the **Arctic
uniquely difficult**]{.underline} [--- challenges that have far more to
do with the **environment** there than **environmental
regulations**.]{.underline}

The industry aims to squeeze as much as possible out of the cheapest oil
reserves it has: areas that will produce a lot of oil for less cost.
[The Arctic has oil, but it **doesn't come cheaply**]{.underline}.
[Companies have to **contend** with **frozen roads**, **remote areas**,
and **transporting** specialized **rigs** before even **unearthing any
oil**]{.underline}. Even in a world without environmental regulations,
[it simply **costs** more for **oil companies** to drill there, ranking
the risks of the Arctic right alongside the risks of **deep-water
drilling** and operating in **politically** **unstable
countries**]{.underline}. Because of the expense, these are also
long-term investments, from which companies plan to benefit over the
course of 30 to 40 years. This introduces a lot more uncertainty because
of the many factors that can affect oil prices in that time.

[The **Willow Project** faces these **disadvantages** and
**more**]{.underline}. [Willow still faces legal challenges from
environmentalists]{.underline}, [but the costs of **drilling** have also
gotten worse in **other ways** --- **ironically**, **because of climate
change**]{.underline}. One example: ConocoPhillips has had to contend
with melting permafrost at the sites it intends to drill, which the
company will try to neutralize by installing giant chilling devices in
the ground.

[For Arctic drilling to make sense economically]{.underline}, [a company
has to bank on prices at the pump remaining high and that consumer
demand will still be there for decades to come]{.underline}. That's [in
spite of]{.underline} [expectations]{.underline} [that EV sales will
**cut into demand** for **gasoline**]{.underline}, with EVs on track to
become half of global car sales by 2035.

Just to break even, the oil would likely need to sell somewhere between
\$63 and \$84 per barrel, based on an analysis from the World Wildlife
Fund --- higher than what energy analysts expect in a world reducing its
reliance on oil.

"They're betting that we're not going to be able to stick within the
confines of the Paris agreement," Wight said. "Arctic oil is a
fundamental bet on the future and what will and will not happen with the
energy transition."

[Are we heading for a **Sixth Mass Extinction**]{.underline}?

[Watching]{.underline} the **[populations]{.underline}** of our most
cherished animals [**dwindle** is **painful**]{.underline}. Year by year
we find fewer nests in the trees, fewer footprints in the soil and
smaller herds in satellite images. As tragic as a population decline is,
it's a realm away from the complete loss of a species. When we are
watching a species in decline -- when we have a downward sloping chart
-- we can cling to the hope that we will reach the trough and
[**numbers** will **climb** again]{.underline}. Indeed, [this has
happened **many times**]{.underline}. The [**African**
elephant]{.underline}, the [**Asian** elephant and the **blue whale**
were all on **course** for]{.underline} a **[wipeout]{.underline}**. But
[we **pulled** on the **handbrake** just in time]{.underline}, and
[**populations** have started to]{.underline} **[recover]{.underline}**.

[Over the **last decade**]{.underline} the number of African
**[elephants]{.underline}** in Namibia has doubled.27, 28 In Burkina
Faso they've increased by 50%. In Zambia, South Africa, Angola,
Ethiopia, Malawi and several other countries, populations [are on the
**up**]{.underline}. After enduring a steep decline there were just
15,000 Asian elephants left in India by 1980. Their [numbers
have]{.underline} now [risen]{.underline} to almost 30,000.

Whether a trend is sloping up or sloping down, there is no reason to
believe that it has to continue that way. [We nearly **always** have the
**opportunity** to **turn** things **around**]{.underline}. But when
that line hits zero -- as it does in an extinction event -- our hopes of
a turnaround vanish. It's done. It's finished. That loss hits
differently. [Yet it's one that the planet has experienced many times

[**Wildlife** is making a **comeback**]{.underline} across some regions.

The [European bison is the continent's largest herbivore]{.underline}.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the bison was widespread and
abundant, stretching from France to Ukraine, down to the tip of the
Black Sea.37 The earliest fossils date back to the Early Holocene period
-- around 9,000 BC.

[Bison populations]{.underline} steadily declined over millennia but
experienced the most dramatic fall over the last 500 years.
Deforestation and hunting of this iconic mammal **[nearly
drove]{.underline}** it [to **extinction**]{.underline}. They had gone
extinct in Hungary by the 16th century, in Ukraine by the 18th, and by
the early 20th century they had gone completely extinct in the wild,
[with only tens of individuals kept in captivity]{.underline}. [The
bison was on the **brink of extinction**]{.underline}. But [it has made
an **impressive comeback**]{.underline} in the last 50 years. By the end
of 2021, there were almost 10,000 of them. [**Across** the **world**, we
find examples of successful **conservation programmes**]{.underline}
that have restored animal populations. [A coalition of conservation
organisations]{.underline} -- including the Zoological Society of
London, BirdLife International and Rewilding Europe -- [**periodically**
publish reports on how **animal populations**]{.underline} in Europe
[are changing]{.underline}. In their latest report they looked at the
change in populations of 24 mammal species and one reptile species --
the loggerhead turtle -- that have been making a comeback.38

Eurasian **[badger]{.underline}** populations achieved an average
increase of 100% -- a doubling. Eurasian **[otters]{.underline}**
tripled, on average. Red **[deer]{.underline}** increased by 331%. The
Eurasian **[beaver]{.underline}** has [made]{.underline} the most
[remarkable **recovery**]{.underline}. It's estimated to have increased
167-fold, on average. There were likely only a few thousand beavers left
in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Today there are more
than 1.2 million.

How has [Europe]{.underline} achieved all this? In short, it has
[**stopped** many of the **activities** that were killing
**mammals**]{.underline} off in the first place. Agricultural land use
has declined across Europe over the last 50 years. This has allowed
natural habitats to return. [Another]{.underline} essential
[**development** has been countries **bringing** in **effective
protection policies** such as]{.underline} complete [**bans**
on]{.underline} hunting or **[hunting quotas]{.underline}**, designated
areas with [**legal protections**, **patrols**]{.underline} to catch
poachers, [and]{.underline} **[compensation schemes]{.underline}** for
the reproduction of certain species. Finally, some animals -- such as
the European bison and beaver -- made their comeback through breeding
and reintroduction programmes.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

[Europe is no outlier]{.underline}. The [**American bison** has become a
**national icon**]{.underline} of the US. Before the Europeans colonised
the American continent there were more than 30 million
[bison]{.underline}. The 19th was a [**rapid** and **vicious** century
of **extermination**]{.underline}. By the 1880s, there were just a few
hundred bison left. Protected parks managed to keep the last remaining
individuals safe from hunting, and better laws against hunting mean they
have made a comeback over the last century. [Today there are around half
a million bison]{.underline} across North America, a [**1,000-fold**
increase from their **lowest point**]{.underline}.

Many of the success stories come from rich countries. But we shouldn't
fall into the trap of assuming that a country has to be rich to protect
its wildlife. There are success stories from countries across the income
distribution.

By the 1960s there were only around 40 Indian rhinos left in the world.
They had gone extinct in **[Pakistan]{.underline}**, and the remaining
few were spread across **[India]{.underline}** and
**[Nepal]{.underline}**. Since then, their numbers have increased
100-fold. There are now almost 4,000 of them. **[Sub-Saharan
Africa]{.underline}** is [home to one of the world's **greatest
conservation** success stories]{.underline}. Southern white rhinos were
once plentiful across the continent. But intense poaching by the
Europeans and killings in the conversion of land for agriculture meant
that by the late 19th century this beautiful animal was close to
extinction. By 1900, there were only 20 left. All were in the
Hluhluwe--iMfolozi Park in South Africa -- now a nature reserve. Over
the course of the 20th century, extreme protection of these species --
particularly in African nature reserves -- led to a significant and
rapid increase in populations to more than 21,000. There are now 1,000
times as many southern white rhinos as there were a century ago.

[The idea that **animals**]{.underline} across the world [are going
**extinct**]{.underline} and we are powerless to change it [is just
**not true**]{.underline}.

First, the good news: **[climate scientists]{.underline}**, as a whole,
[are not warning us to prepare for the apocalypse]{.underline}. The
[**most recent report** of the]{.underline} Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (**[IPCC]{.underline}**) --- a group of hundreds of
scientists working with the United Nations to analyze climate change
research from around the world --- [names]{.underline} many serious
[risks brought on by the warming]{.underline} of our planet,
[but]{.underline} human [extinction is **not among them**]{.underline}.1

"If I had to rate odds, I would say the [**chances of climate change**
driving us to the point of human extinction are **very
low**]{.underline}, [if not **zero**]{.underline}," says Adam Schlosser,
the Deputy Director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy
of Global Change and a climate scientist who studies future climate
change and its impact on human societies.

In some ways, the **[most recent climate science]{.underline}** even
[shows]{.underline} some [encouraging trends]{.underline}. IPCC reports
have always spelled out different scenarios for the amount of
climate-altering greenhouse gases humans will put into the atmosphere,
to show a range of possible climate risks the world may face. The IPCC
calls these scenarios "representative concentration pathways" (RCPs),
and they range from the relatively mild RCP2.6 scenario all the way up
to RCP8.5, whose risks would be calamitous.

But as the [world has made progress in **recent years** on **switching
to clean energy** and controlling our **greenhouse gas
emissions**]{.underline}, it has [become clearer that we are
not]{.underline}, in fact, [headed toward the **worst-case
scenarios**]{.underline}. "[RCP8.5 is being **viewed more and more** as
an **extreme outcome**]{.underline}," says Schlosser. [Even with **no
further progress**]{.underline} on climate action, he says, the
less-dire RCP6.0 scenario now looks closest to reality.

[The]{.underline} 2023 [United Nations Climate Change

[Perhaps **no frame** has been more]{.underline} **[hotly
debated]{.underline}**---[and]{.underline}
**[misunderstood]{.underline}**---[than whether climate change poses an
**existential risk**]{.underline}. As this week's title reveals, [the
answer is **not definitive**]{.underline}. But understanding the
circumstances under which climate change is and is not an existential
risk has profound bearing on whether our policy response benefits or
harms humanity. An existential risk threatens the existence of a
subject, such as a community, a nation state, or even humanity as a
whole. In this sense, climate change does present such a risk to certain
communities or nation states, such as low-lying island countries
susceptible to sea-level rise. [Climate change is, to a degree, a matter

change is existential to an alarming proportion of **Earth's
species**]{.underline}---with up to half facing extinction. We can learn
much from the history of the human condition under previous climate
eras. [Paleoclimate data reveal that **climatic
fluctuations**]{.underline} [markedly affected human
evolution]{.underline} and perhaps eliminated some human populations up
to continental scale a million years ago. **[Overall]{.underline}**,
[however]{.underline}, [primitive humans **proved
resilient**]{.underline} [under a variety of **harsh climatic
conditions**]{.underline}. In fact, the [collapse of the **Atlantic
meridional overturning** circulation current]{.underline}---[arguably
the **biggest climate risk**]{.underline} [in the news
today]{.underline}--- previously [occurred about]{.underline} **[14,500
years ago.]{.underline}** This is not to understate the threat that
human-caused climate change presents, but simply to put it in
perspective. [There are scenarios of climate "**tail
events"**]{.underline} [that could **accelerate**]{.underline} [climatic
disruption]{.underline} and induce massive economic, social and
ecological damages. [Yet there is **no** scenario in which humanity
would **not be able to provide**]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[bulk]{.underline}** [of its **basic needs,**]{.underline} [especially
with]{.underline} **[further technological advances.]{.underline}**
Distinguishing the circumstances of existential climate risk is not just
semantically important---it is crucial for better civil society
dialogue, policy analysis and decisions. Importantly, policies to
mitigate climate change only improve society if their benefits exceed
their costs. [An **existential threat**]{.underline} [to humanity
warrants **virtually any intervention**]{.underline} to reduce the risk.
[For example, if a civilization-destroying **asteroid**]{.underline}
[were hurtling toward Earth]{.underline}, any price tag to neutralize
the threat would be worth it. [Climate change is]{.underline} **[often
mischaracterized]{.underline}** [in this way]{.underline}, as it was by
President Joe Biden earlier this year. Some cultural analogies even use
the asteroid metaphor literally, as in the movie Don't Look Up. [Such
discourse encourages]{.underline} **[policy interventions]{.underline}**
[irrespective of their **cost** and **ignores** the value of
adaptation.]{.underline} A variety of interventions like fossil fuel
bans and green subsidies now impose costs that exceed their climate
benefits, whereas market-based policies would reduce emissions at costs
below benefits. **[Economical policies]{.underline}** [that **improve
adaptation**]{.underline} [in vulnerable areas]{.underline} like
[Florida must be **prioritized**]{.underline} in order to minimize human
suffering.
