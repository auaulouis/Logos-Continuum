For the purpose of this Charter, the term \"development cooperation\"
refers to \"international cooperation activities that are conducted by
the government and its affiliated agencies for the main purpose of
development in developing regions.\" In this connection,
\"**[development]{.underline}**\" in this Charter is [used in a
broader]{.underline} [sense]{.underline} rather than in the narrow
sense; it also [encompasses]{.underline} such activities as
**[peacebuilding]{.underline}** and **[governance]{.underline}**,
promotion of basic **[human rights]{.underline}** and **[humanitarian

**[Development]{.underline}**: The [preparation of a specific mineral
deposit for **commercial production**;]{.underline} this preparation
includes construction of access to the deposit and of facilities to
extract the minerals. The development process is sometimes further
distinguished between a preproduction stage and a current stage, with
the distinction being made on the basis of whether the development work
is performed before or after production from the mineral deposit has
commenced on a commercial scale.

### 2AC\-\--T\-\--Non-Military

[The **clearest dividing line**]{.underline} [in the world's icebreaker
fleet is between **commercial icebreakers**]{.underline}, which are
[primarily involved in **economic activity**]{.underline}, [and
national-asset icebreakers, which generally support their owning
government's non-economic policy, whether that be **national scientific
research**]{.underline}, defence and sovereignty, or safety and
environmental protection. Although individual [icebreakers can **serve
either purpose**]{.underline}, perhaps with some refitting (after all,
in all cases, the core mission -- to break ice -- is the same), national
policy for icebreaker fleets usually leans toward one extreme or
another.

#### 2. Military assets can be used for "non-military" exploration/development

HDCSW-Packet

Derek Reveron's concept of "exporting security" (discussed in detail in
a book of the same name just released by Georgetown University Press)
could provide a way forward out of this impasse. Although the public's
attention is drawn to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,
much of what the U.S. military is doing today is strengthening the
capacities of partners---strengthening their abilities to exercise
effective control over their territories and coastlines and to be in a
position to repel outside threats. The United States has
security-assistance programs with 149 other nations. Some of it is
active, kinetic support in combating insurgents, terrorist groups or
drug cartels, as in Yemen and Colombia. Some of it is developing
partnership and training programs to enhance the ability of nations to
deploy peacekeeping forces or coast guards. It can encompass the gamut
from humanitarian relief operations to creating defensive alliances. The
net result of all of these efforts is to "develop enduring relations"
with other states that gives the United States access to a global
network of bases and platforms, but also "strengthens key partners and
reduces both the need for American presence and the negative attention
it sometimes generates"---and in so doing, can also reduce the burden on
the United States to have to act as a global sheriff. Reveron's approach
avoids the "stocking up" approach to military procurement, because the
emphasis would be on finding ways to deploy and use assets, rather than
warehousing systems "in case of emergency." For instance, [in the
maritime realm,]{.underline} the [carriers,]{.underline} amphibious
[vessels and destroyers]{.underline} [that were designed to contain the
Soviet navy]{.underline} and protect sea lines of communication ([and
which might be used in a similar role vis-à-vis China in the
future]{.underline}) [are now being used "to conduct
activities]{.underline} ashore [to improve human security.]{.underline}"
[The]{.underline} 2010 [response to the Haiti earthquake saw an aircraft
carrier and sixteen other warships]{.underline} deployed [to
provide]{.underline} [**humanitarian**]{.underline} relief [and **rescue
services;**]{.underline} **[such "nonmilitary" missions]{.underline}**,
in turn, [help]{.underline} to reduce the factors which can produce
security threats to [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and
[reinforce]{.underline} American [ties with other states]{.underline}.
[Reveron quotes a **navy** official who notes that using "war" assets
for non-military missions such as]{.underline} training and
[humanitarian relief means]{.underline} "[We can]{.underline} show up,
provide training, [provide resources, and]{.underline} then [leave very
little footprint behind.]{.underline}" An "exporting security" approach
guides future procurement decisions towards "multiuse" platforms that
can combine conventional and non-conventional missions.

#### 3. We meet exploration\-\--icebreakers are used explicitly for the purpose of finding sites appropriate for drilling. 

#### 4. Counter-interpretation. "Exploration" refers to [early activity]{.underline} in a [remote area]{.underline}.

\(E\) [The Meaning of **the Term**]{.underline}
\'**[Exploration]{.underline}** and Exploitation\'

\(1\) Outer Space

The 1967 Treaty\'s title is "Treaty on Principles Governing the Activity
of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon
and other Celestial Bodies". One is tempted to argue that the term
"exploration and use", which appears in the 1962 Principles1 which
preceded the 1967 Treaty as well as in the body of the latter, is an
adaptation of the concept of exploration and exploitation included in
the Continental Shelf Convention. [But, as shall be shown
below]{.underline}, [in that Convention the concept may refer to
**applied research**]{.underline}, something it is doubtful the Outer
Space Treaty was meant to convey. [An alternative, **plausible
interpretation** is that the word **\'exploration\'** alone has a **very
particular meaning**]{.underline} [--- namely, the **initial**,
**exploratory phase of** **discovery** which **characterises early
activity in any remote area**.]{.underline}

#### And, "development" means to make something more advanced. That [includes]{.underline} making [natural resources]{.underline} more [available.]{.underline}

Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 59(a). HN4 In construing \[\*7\] a provision of
the Texas Constitution, [it is our duty to ascertain]{.underline} [and
give effect to the **plain intent**]{.underline} [and language of its
framers and of the **people who adopted it**]{.underline}. Gragg v.
Cayuga Indep. Sch. Dist., 539 S.W.2d 861, 865-66 (Tex. 1976) (citing
Deason v. Orange Cnty. Water Control & Improvement Dist. No. 1, 151 Tex.
29, 244 S.W.2d 981, 984 (1952)). HN5 Section 59(a) specifies the
purposes for which water control and improvement districts may be
organized. [One of those **expressly stated** purposes is
\"**development**\"]{.underline} of the waters of the State\'s rivers
and streams for \"power.\" [The term \"development\" is defined as \"to
**bring out** the **capabilities** or **possibilities** of; bring to a
more **advanced** or **effective state**]{.underline},\" Random House
Dictionary of the English Language 543 (2d ed. 1987), [and more
**specifically** with **respect** to **natural resources** \"to make

previously only **potentially available** or **useable**]{.underline})
[including the natural resources of the region]{.underline},\"
Webster\'s Third New Int\'l Dictionary 618 (2002). Thus, a plain reading
of the provision contemplates that a conservation and reclamation
district such as the LCRA may use the State\'s waters to aid, promote,
or facilitate the generation of \[\*8\] power. While Wynne contends that
the term \"power\" should be read to be limited to hydroelectric power,
the provision itself contains no such limitation. Moreover, production
of power by means other than hydroelectric generation falls squarely
within the expressly permitted \"other useful purposes\" to which the
State\'s water may be put---i.e., providing power for use by the
State\'s citizens.

The planning legislation

19.Planning control is a creature of legislation. The main elements of
the statutory scheme remain the same as they were when first introduced
across England and Wales by the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. The
principal Act is now the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the "1990
Act"). By section 57 of the 1990 Act, planning permission is required
for the carrying out of any development of land. [The term
"**development**" is defined in section 55(1) to mean "the **carrying**
out of **building**, **engineering**, **mining** or other
**operations**]{.underline} **[in]{.underline}**, [on, over or under
land, or the making of any **material change in the use** of any
**buildings** or **other land**]{.underline}". In this case we are
concerned with the former type of development (operational development)
and not with change in use.
