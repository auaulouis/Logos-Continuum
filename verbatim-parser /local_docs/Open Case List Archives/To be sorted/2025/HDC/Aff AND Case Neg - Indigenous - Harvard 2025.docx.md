Yay to the group that help put this together -- Zaynab, JoJo, Daleyah,
Sam, Maite, Lindsey, Keshav, Ayden, Ishan, Cian -- and gratitude to the
other files created before the workshop and during that will also help
apply!

# Strategy Notes 

## General 

This is a workshop file -- yep, that means ontologically not perfect!
And, as we debate with this at the end of this week, we will DEFINITELY
add cards if needed when we note holes. This gives you a good sense of
the general approach you can you take on the aff and the neg as you move
into the year!

## Aff

The plan options all viable -- and you should think about what might be
the most strategic. The first plan text option does the most to explain
what the Lezak and Rock evidence says is necessary to address capacity
gap in accessing development resources.

T defense -- in addition the CI ev, most of our evidence talks about
development and infrastructure development in the Arctic and Alaska; the
cards are good about why the indigenous perspective on development is
necessary to challenge colonialism.

Climate only version just jettisons the framing -- and adds some cards
to the advantage. I have put a \* next to the cards that are probably
pretty important -- if it's too long, then you could remove the non \*
cards. I would suggest this if you don't think you will get much out of
the framing contention. The framing contention, however has a lot of
good stuff against Das as well Ks. The climate with framing version has
a lot of offense in it -- including discussions of indigenous
sovereignty

Several grant programs have been cut by Trump -- and yes we would defend
that the programs are restored \[and that's the language in plans like
including restoration of development grant programs.

Ask if you have questions!

## Neg 

Cap, set col, and security \[with climate links\] kinda best options --
while this may not be how you roll at home \[reading Ks\], this will be
a good chance to try out some stuff! Set col link debate focuses on the
role of reforming the states -- and while there's a lot of aff offense,
this will be a good link versus link turn/perm debates. We may put out a
supplement if a DA about energy development being bad comes together.
There's some offense on the case about climate catastrophizing. T --
development and T- Arctic \[that includes xtra T arg for practice\].

Ask if you have questions!

# 1AC 

## Plan options 

#### Plan: The United States federal government should initiate federal-Tribal collaborations regarding development through infrastructural planning; hire Tribal liaisons to coordinate with Alaskan Native communities for grant program evaluation; and develop joint federal-Tribal agendas in the Arctic, including restoration of development grant programs. 

#### Plan -- The United States federal government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Arctic by increasing collaboration with indigenous groups in US territories in the Arctic.

#### Plan -- The United States federal government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Arctic by expanding federal-tribal collaborations regarding development of the Arctic.

accounts held at Citibank --- and formally terminated the grants. A U.S.
District Court quickly issued a temporary restraining order, finding the
EPA acted unlawfully. The EPA's attempt to overturn that ruling is still
awaiting a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals.

In addition to cutting key tax credits and grant programs, [[HR 1

[The [Arctic region plays a pivotal role in the global climate system
due to its unique geophysical and ecological
characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The importance]{.mark} of the
Arctic [extends beyond its immediate geographic
boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [influencing weather patterns, oceanic
circulation, and global temperature regulation]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Understanding the Arctic's role in the climate system [is [crucial for
comprehending the broader impacts of climate change and developing
strategies to mitigate its effects]{.underline}]{.mark} \[70\]. [The
[Arctic's high albedo]{.mark}, or reflectivity, is a c[ritical]{.mark}
[factor in regulating the]{.mark} [Earth's energy
balance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Snow and ice surfaces reflect a
significant portion of incoming solar radiation back into space, helping
to cool the planet[[. As climate change leads to the melting of Arctic
ice, the albedo effect diminishes]{.underline},]{.mark} resulting in
increased absorption of solar radiation by darker ocean and land
surfaces. [[This positive feedback loop accelerates regional and global
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} \[38\]. [The ice-albedo feedback mechanism
is a [key]{.mark} [driver of Arctic amplification]{.mark}, where the
region warms at a faster rate than the global average]{.underline}. As
ice and snow melt, exposed surfaces absorb more heat, leading to further
melting and warming. [This process not only affects the Arctic but also
[contributes to global temperature rise and climate
variability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Arctic is]{.underline}
[integral]{.underline}]{.mark} to the global thermohaline circulation,
also known as the [["ocean conveyor belt.]{.underline}"]{.mark} This
circulation is driven by differences in water density, influenced by
temperature and salinity. Cold, dense water in the Arctic sinks and
flows southward, driving deep ocean currents that help regulate global
climate by redistributing heat and nutrients. [[Disruptions to this
circulation due to Arctic warming and freshwater input from melting ice
can have far-reaching effects on climate patterns and marine
ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}. The melting of Arctic sea ice and
glaciers contributes to an influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic.
This influx [can alter ocean salinity and stratification,]{.underline}
impacting thermohaline circulation. Changes in this circulation can
[affect weather patterns]{.underline}, including the strength and
position of the Gulf Stream, which plays a crucial role in moderating
the climate of Europe and North America[. [The Arctic influences
atmospheric circulation]{.underline}]{.mark}[, particularly the
[behavior of the polar]{.mark} [jet stream]{.mark},]{.underline} a
fast-fowing ribbon of air that encircles the polar region. [Warming in
the Arctic can weaken the temperature gradient between the poles and the
equator, leading to a slower and more meandering jet
stream]{.underline}. This can [[result in extreme weather
events,]{.underline}]{.mark} such as prolonged cold spells, heatwaves,
and heavy precipitation, affecting midlatitude regions \[11\]. The
Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a climate pattern characterized by the
fluctuation of atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and
mid-latitudes. Changes in the AO can influence weather patterns across
the Northern Hemisphere. A positive phase of the AO is associated with a
stronger polar vortex and milder winter conditions in the mid-latitudes,
while a negative phase can lead to colder and more severe winters.
[[Arctic warming can impact the dynamics of the AO, contributing to
increased climate variability.]{.underline} The [Arctic is a significant
carbon sink]{.underline}]{.mark}, with vast amounts of carbon stored in
permafrost and tundra ecosystems. Thawing permafrost due to rising
temperatures releases stored carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into
the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and further
accelerating global warming. [This [release of greenhouse gases]{.mark}
[from the Arctic]{.mark} has the potential to create a
feedback]{.underline} [loop, [amplifying]{.mark} climate change
[impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a
much higher warming potential than CO2 over short time scales. [The
Arctic contains [large reserves of methane in permafrost and
methane]{.mark} [hydrate]{.mark}]{.underline}[s.]{.mark} As permafrost
[[thaws]{.underline}]{.mark}, these methane reserves can be released,
significantly [enhancing the greenhouse effect and [contributing to
abrupt climate changes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic hosts unique and
diverse ecosystems that provide critical services, such as carbon
sequestration, habitat for wildlife, and support for indigenous
communities. [These [ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate
change]{.mark}, with shifts in species]{.underline} [distributions, loss
of sea ice habitat, and alterations in food webs [impacting biodiversity
and ecosystem functionality]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arctic [indigenous
communities rely on the region's natural resources for their cultural,
economic, and social well-being]{.mark}]{.underline}. Climate change and
its impacts on the Arctic environment threaten traditional livelihoods,
food security, and cultural heritage. [Understanding and addressing
these impacts is essential for supporting the resilience and
sustainability of Arctic communities]{.underline}. [The Arctic is a
crucial component of the global climate system, influencing energy
balance, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, carbon and methane cycles,
and biodiversity]{.underline}. The rapid changes occurring in the Arctic
due to climate change have profound implications for global climate
patterns, weather extremes, and ecosystem health[. [Recognizing the
interconnectedness of the Arctic with the rest of the planet underscores
the importance of mitigating climate change and protecting this vital
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Efforts to reduce]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions,]{.mark} [preserve Arctic ecosystems]{.mark}, and [support
adaptive strategies]{.mark} for [local communities]{.mark} are
[essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the global
climate system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### And, these same climate realities mean that squo approaches to Arctic development focus on the "Arctic resource boom" imposing a laundry list of environmental impacts on Indigenous groups in the Arctic that replicates colonial power structures characteristic of engagement of the region over time

An estimated [10 percent of the nearly four million residents throughout
the entire Arctic region are Indigenous]{.underline}.1) Indigenous
populations have inhabited much of the Arctic for thousands of years,
long before the land was claimed and divided into nation-states.
Interest in opportunities for natural resource extraction drove the
historic colonization in the Arctic2) and, [today, the
increasing]{.underline} [accessibility of minerals and oil due to
climate change is fuelling the]{.underline} so-called "**[Arctic
resource boom]{.underline}**"3)---[a quest to]{.underline} find and
**[exploit]{.underline}** [the region's remaining
resources.]{.underline} [As more international players hope to
participate in Arctic affairs, it is **critical** to not only consider
how these ventures impact **Indigenous populations** but to prioritize
**decolonization** in these spaces]{.underline}.

[Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic]{.underline}
than in any other part of the world, with the most recent evidence
pointing to a rate of warming nearly four times greater than the global
average.4) This [warming is driving the thawing of permafrost, loss of
seasonal snow cover, and melting of sea ice, ice caps and glaciers;
each,]{.underline} in turn, [increasing the **accessibility** of
**natural resources** and growing **global interest** in the
Arctic]{.underline}.5) This article uses a decolonization framework to
analyze resource development with a focus on the United States (US),
which is considered an Arctic state by way of Alaska. [Decolonization
will be defined as a concept and practice of confronting and reversing
the historic and ongoing legacies of colonialism,]{.underline}6)
[including the structures of power that uphold
inequalities]{.underline}.

After a brief background covering land ownership and some of the
outcomes of resource development in Alaska, this article will delve into
dynamics that reproduce and perpetuate colonial structures of power.
This analysis will feature (i) the prioritization of state and federal
interests through the idea of sovereignty and (ii) the primacy and
assumed superiority of Western knowledge and conventions and,
conversely, the disregard for Indigenous knowledge systems and
worldviews. To bridge the gap between theory and action, the article
will continually ask what it would mean to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic. [**Confronting** the ongoing systems and
dynamics of **colonialism** must be placed at the **forefront** of
present-day and future Arctic engagement and
collaboration]{.underline}---not only in the US, but [throughout the
region]{.underline}

Background

The United States purchased the land that is present-day Alaska from
Russia in 1867. Just over a century later, in 1968, the discovery of oil
in Prudhoe Bay made the Arctic relevant at a national scale.7) The
commercial export of oil to the lower 48 states was now possible for the
first time. Hindering this ambition, however, was the fact that the
planned pipeline to carry the oil south traversed lands claimed by
Alaska Native populations. 'Alaska Native' refers collectively to the
Indigenous populations who have lived in present-day Alaska for
thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the 1700s.8) This
term encompasses "many nations and tribes" and "widely diverse cultures,
languages, lifeways, art forms and histories".9) To enable the
construction of the pipeline to the contiguous United States, land
claims issues around Prudhoe Bay were settled with the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971. ANCSA extinguished Indigenous
claims to nearly 400 million acres of land throughout the state in
exchange for \$962.5 million and ownership of 43.7 million acres.

ANCSA also divided the state into twelve regions, each with an Alaska
Native Regional Corporation. The regional boundaries of the corporations
do not, however, equate to land ownership; land in Alaska is
predominantly owned by the state and federal governments. Just 10
percent of Alaska's 663,000 square miles are owned by Alaska Native
populations.10) The Regional Corporations operate under US corporate law
to administer resources and serve the local communities. These
for-profit corporations participate in the Alaskan natural resource
industry, both directly and indirectly.

[Federal Arctic policy in the US]{.underline} [has tended to
emphasize]{.underline} the [exploitation]{.underline} [of Arctic
resources for US economic development]{.underline}.11) W[ithin the new
National Strategy for the Arctic Region]{.underline} (released October
2022), [economic development continues to receive a strong
emphasis---alongside security---and Arctic investments are expected to
increase over the following decade]{.underline}.12) In the face of this
ever-growing interest in Arctic engagement, [Alaska Native
communities]{.underline} may [face new and renewed **colonial
intrusion** in the form of **large-scale resource
development**]{.underline}.13)

Effects of resource development

Continual '[**boom and bust**']{.underline} [with periods of financial
growth and decline characterizes resource development in the
**capitalist system**]{.underline}.14) This [instability]{.underline}
[prohibits]{.underline} many [communities from relying]{.underline}
solely [on economies centered on resource extraction]{.underline}.
[Subsistence practices provide a source of greater
stability]{.underline} within what would otherwise be an unstable
extractive economy.15) [**Resource extraction** has]{.underline},
however, [had **detrimental impacts** on the land, water, and wildlife
that reduce the viability of subsistence lifeways.]{.underline}
Specifically, [extractive activities have been found to **increase**
**vulnerability** to **biological invasion**]{.underline},16) [bring
changes to the land with built infrastructure]{.underline},17) [and
introduce the risk of contamination, such as **oil
spills**]{.underline}.18) [The resulting decreased viability of
subsistence practices is worsened by the threat climate change poses to
hunting and gathering activities]{.underline}.19)

Although some measures of physical health have improved since ANCSA,20)
[resource extraction can compromise the **health** and **wellbeing** of
nearby Indigenous populations.]{.underline} [Significant health
disparities remain among Alaska Natives compared to
non-native]{.underline} Alaskans and other US [residents]{.underline}.
Generally, [Alaska Natives have a **lower life expectancy**, increased
risk of **cardiovascular disease**, and an **elevated burden of
infectious disease**.]{.underline}21) [By exacerbating **food
insecurity**, the negative impacts of resource development may
contribute to and **worsen health outcomes**.]{.underline}
[Many]{.underline} of these disparities [are rooted in]{.underline} the
history of [colonialism]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [socio-political
marginalization]{.underline}; in addition, [their persistence today may
be attributed to the disproportionate exposure to environmental health
hazards]{.underline}.22) Moreover, some researchers have found that
[health data fails to produce a holistic picture of well-being,
suggesting that there must be a greater consideration for
context-specific understandings of health status]{.underline}.23)

Importantly, [the effects of resource development are not felt uniformly
by Alaska Natives]{.underline}. Instead, [various facets of identity
among individuals and communities impact how they relate to extractive
activities]{.underline}. [Socioeconomic class divisions]{.underline},24)
[gender identity]{.underline},25) [one's location in a rural versus
urban setting]{.underline},26) [and many other factors can all impact
how resource development is experienced]{.underline}. [The
**complexity** of the relationship]{.underline} between resource
development and Indigenous populations, and the diversity within the
Alaska Native population, [**must not be ignored** or
simplified]{.underline}.

[Many national [governments prioritise **neoliberal development** and
**resource extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline} (mining, oil, and gas),
[[while **Indigenous governance** systems advocate for **sustainable
resource management**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[103,••32,92\]. In Norway,
the government's focus on oil and gas development often conflicts with
Indigenous demands for sustainable re- source management \[33\]. [[This
prioritisation of resource extraction over environmental and cultural
preservation acts as a barrier to adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
Russia, large-scale oil and gas projects --- such as those in the Yamal
Peninsula --- have led to forced relocations of Nenets and Evenki
reindeer herders, significantly reducing their ability to maintain
traditional migration routes \[107,44\]. [In Alaska and Canada,
governments continue to grant resource ex- traction permits on
Indigenous lands, despite widespread resistance from Indigenous
communities]{.underline} \[28,5\]. The oil drilling Willow Project in
Alaska, approved in 2023, has faced intense opposition from Indigenous
activists who argue that it will increase environmental destruction,
disrupt wildlife migration patterns, and accelerate per- mafrost thawing
\[31\]. However, the project was still ap- proved, highlighting how
governance systems frequently privilege economic interests over
Indigenous sovereignty and long-term climate resilience.

[[**Indigenous communities** are often **marginalised** in **gov-
ernance**, **decision-making processes**, **adaptation plan- ning**, and
**consultation** in resource extraction and face **challenges** in
asserting their rights and interests]{.underline}]{.mark} \[103,97\].
[[This **exclusion** creates **significant barriers** to
adaptation]{.mark}, [as policies that do not incorporate Indigenous
perspec- tives often fail to address the realities of Arctic
life]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Many of [[the **governance failures** in the Arctic are **rooted** in
historical and ongoing **colonialism**, resulting in land dispossession
and forced relocation, which have collec- tively impeded
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in certain cases, [[severed the im- portant
connections of Indigenous Peoples with their ancestral
territories]{.underline}]{.mark} \[47,••65\]. In many cases, these co-
lonial structures do not just act as barriers but as limits --- where
Indigenous communities have permanently lost land, mobility, and
self-governance, making adaptation fundamentally more difficult. [In
Canada and [Alaska]{.mark}, many [Indigenous communities were forcibly
relocated to permanent settlements, disrupting lifestyles, tradi- tional
hunting practices, and climate-adaptive mobility
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline} [\[]{.mark}17,69\]. [[These relocations
have had lasting im- pacts on food security, mental health, and cultural
pre- servation, creating a structural limit to adaptation]{.underline}
\[25\].]{.mark}

[[Colonialism and injustice have evolved into government policies
limiting access to resources]{.underline}]{.mark} such as small-scale
Indigenous Peoples' fisheries and favouring offshore traw- lers,
resulting in historical and present-day inequities in the fishing sector
\[94\]. [Historical, interpersonal, epistemic, and systemic racism has
created socioeconomic disparities, lim- iting access to health care,
education, resources, and eco- nomic opportunities and affected the
health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} \[24,••59\].
[This presents a limit and undermines the adaptive
capacity]{.underline}.

[[**Colonisation** has systematically **turned** the natural con-
straints in the Arctic into **severe socioeconomic barriers** by
**undermining** Indigenous **autonomy** and **severing traditional
adaptation strategies**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[••65\]. Forced se-
dentarisation, land dispossession, and restrictive re- source governance
have stripped Indigenous communities of their ability to flexibly
respond to en- vironmental challenges \[104\]. [[Colonial policies have
re- inforced]{.underline} the [infrastructural
limitations]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- [investing in resource extraction
rather than local development, leaving Indigenous communities with high
costs of living, food insecurity, and limited access to essential
service]{.mark}s]{.underline} \[55,90\]. [[What were once manageable
ecological limits have thus been compounded by imposed social,
political, and economic constraints, shaping the struc- tural
inequalities that define contemporary Arctic adap- tation
challenges]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[Colonialism has created both barriers and limits to adaptation by
forcibly relocating Indigenous commu- nities to environmentally
unsuitable and high-risk areas]{.underline}, where traditional hunting
and fishing practices are no longer viable. While initially a barrier,
this [displacement has evolved into a structural limit, as these
communities are now deeply established, making relocation im- practical
despite increasing climate risks]{.underline}. State-imposed wildlife
regulations restrict Indigenous adaptive flex- ibility, preventing
communities from adjusting their subsistence practices in response to
environmental changes \[22\]. These [[policies]{.underline}, often
[designed without Indigenous input]{.underline}, [reinforce colonial
constraints on adaptation, further limiting the agency of Arctic In-
digenous Peoples in navigating climate challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[geopolitical competition]{.underline}]{.mark} among major powers
such as the United States, Russia, Canada, and China; the [[esca- lation
of military operations]{.underline} by Arctic nations; the ex[- pansion
of commercial shipping routes through the Arctic]{.underline}; [and the
exploration of oil, gas, and mineral resources]{.underline} [have
emerged as important limits affecting Arctic governance and
adaptation]{.underline} \[]{.mark}30,79\]. The geopolitics of the Arctic
has gained global attention due to climate change, resulting in
increased interest in commercial shipping and energy resources \[95\].
The reduction of sea ice has triggered a surge in human activities where
countries and corpora- tions vie for control over resources and shipping
routes, diverting attention and resources for adaptation. This is
exacerbated by increasing militarisation of the Arctic \[101\],
affecting environmental and human sustainability and security and
long-term adaptation planning. Russia has significantly expanded
military bases in the Arctic, while the U.S. and NATO allies have
increased defence spending \[57\]. This geopolitical tension reduces
interna- tional cooperation on climate adaptation, as nations prioritise
strategic control over adaptation funding and environmental protection.
Geopolitical competition is a structural limit, as it shifts governance
priorities away from climate resilience and human security and toward
national security concerns.

Conclusion

[[Addressing barriers and limits to climate change adap- tation requires
transformative structural changes that recognise Indigenous rights,
knowledge, and sover- eignty, and a move towards **inclusive
governance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These changes can be achieved
through targeted policies and frameworks]{.underline},]{.mark} such as
the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development Working Group, [which
facilitates colla- boration on climate resilience strategies grounded in
Indigenous knowledge.]{.underline} [Initiatives like co-management
agreements between Indigenous communities and na- tional governments
provide effective models for fos- tering inclusive
decision-making.]{.underline} [[Investing in **resilient

In recent years[, the Arctic]{.underline} and sub-[Arctic regions have
seen an increased interest in investment in mining and low-carbon energy
infrastructure]{.underline}. As Fig. 2 shows, [at least 80 % of
low-carbon energy]{.underline} (all stages from planning to operating[)
and mineral]{.underline} (including exploration, construction,
operating, closure, and abandonment) [projects are intersected with
territories where diverse circumpolar Indigenous people's' languages are
spoken and Indigenous peoples hold land based rights, interests, and
knowledges]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} number [could be even
higher, as the absence of Indigenous languages on the map does not
necessary mean there are no Indigenous peoples or land rights. And it is
likely that extractive and energy industries will expand]{.underline},
be it deep seabed mineral exploration, rare earths mining, wind energy
generation, storage, and transmission and transportation infrastructure.
[Among multiple drivers behind this increase are energy security
concerns, global geopolitical re-alignments, and numerous policies and
strategic documents]{.underline}, including the European Green Deal
(2020), the European Critical Raw Materials Act (2023), the US's
Inflation Reduction Act (2022), and Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy
(2023), among others[.]{.underline}

While these documents underscore the importance of balancing economic
development with social and environmental goals, [there is a need to
bring light to the distribution of burdens and opportunities of energy
transition in the circumpolar north. Central to this understanding is
that energy transitions in the circumpolar north are deeply intertwined
with the history of colonialism]{.underline}, as it continues to shape
the region's environmental and sociopolitical landscape[. Colonial
policies have been prioritizing extractive industries]{.underline} (such
as fur trading, mining, forestry, hydropower and oil extraction) [in the
region perceived as the "terra nullius", expropriating lands, and
marginalising Indigenous communities. Ongoing energy transitions are
intensifying resource extraction against the legacy of historical and
existing extractive industries and reproducing colonial attitudes as
decision-making continues to exclude Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

[These dynamics have led to the framing of the region as a "green
sacrifice zone", providing a deep interrogation of neocolonial, racial,
cultural, and environmental underpinnings of making "green" industrial
economies. The concept of "sacrifice zones" has gained popularity in the
US regarding nuclear testing locations, waste sites and extractive
regions, which are "sacrificed" for a higher purpose in the name of
profit and progress, highlighting environments and populations that are
marginalised.]{.underline} The value of its application in the Arctic
context is that it "helps to see how the participation and distribution
of burdens and benefits are understood and considered" given the impacts
of industrial projects on communities driven by top-down policies and
the global demand for resources and low-carbon energy[. Issues of a just
energy transition in the Arctic have received increasing attention, with
the calls for evaluation of existing projects, legal instruments and
policy frameworks, as well as identification of gaps and areas for
improvement.]{.underline} This review addresses these needs.

Social norms

The inherent challenges of living in the Arctic constrain human
settlement, infrastructure, and economic activity. [Extreme climatic
conditions and short growing seasons render large-scale agriculture
unviable, necessitating reliance on subsistence practices or imported
food]{.underline} \[22,46\]. [**Sparse population** and]{.underline}
vast **[geographic expanses]{.underline}** significantly [**limit** the
**feasibility** of shared infrastructure]{.underline}, such as extensive
road networks and power grids, [in- creasing the **cost** and
**logistical complexity** of economic development]{.underline} \[11\].
[However, these]{.underline} same [conditions have historically provided
**ecological** and **cultural** **advantages for Indigenous
communities.**]{.underline} [Sparse human populations relative to
abundant fish and wildlife have sustained traditional subsistence
economies, ensuring food se- curity through hunting, fishing, and
herding]{.underline} \[23\]. [**The vast, open landscapes have
facilitated mobility, enabling seasonal resource access and fostering
resilient adapta- tion strategies**.]{.underline}

[[The **loss of traditional knowledge** is an **important barrier** to
**adaptation** in the Arctic.]{.underline} [External pressures such as
**globalisation** cause resource extraction, displacement, and
environmental degradation, impacting Indigenous knowledge systems,
cultural practices, languages, and institutions]{.underline} \[21\],
hence [perpetuating **epistemic injustice**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Economic and environmental changes exacerbate this, causing
generational discontinuities in the transfer of traditional knowledge to
younger generations]{.underline} \[]{.mark}81\]. [[There is **limited
prioritisation** of Indigenous Peoples in adaptation policy development
and support to respond to climate impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[10,13\]. [The [**lack of engagement** and **exclusion** of
**Indigenous Peoples**, **knowledge**, and **per- spectives** from
policy formulations]{.mark} [is a **barrier** that affects the
implementation of effective culturally sensitive adaptation strategies
and]{.mark} [policies tailored and relevant to Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} \[49,87\].

[**Cultural practices** such as sharing networks, communal hunting, oral
traditions, storytelling, and connections to the land and ocean are
**affected** by loss of traditional hunting grounds and wildlife due to
**climate change impacts**]{.underline} \[29\], [affecting **food
security** and weakening **community agency**, **cultural identity**,
**resilience**, and **adaptive capacity**]{.underline}. [[Indigenous
knowledge systems are **important** for adaptation and are **at risk**
due to cultural assimilation, modernisation, generational gaps, and
transformative environmental changes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[108,77\].
[[This loss creates **barriers**]{.underline}, [as it **reduces adaptive
capacity** and **coping mechanisms**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[undermining
the ability of com- munities to respond effectively to changing climatic
conditions.]{.underline} [It reduces sustainable resource
management]{.underline}]{.mark} [and adaptive capacities and practices
where [commu- nities could potentially lose critical insights that
inform locally appropriate and culturally sensitive adaptation
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} \[23,87\].

In Scandinavia, [[Sami herding traditions]{.underline}, [which involve
adaptive rotational grazing to maintain reindeer popula-
tions]{.underline},]{.mark} [are]{.underline} often [disregarded in
conservation planning.]{.underline} [Instead, policymakers prioritise
European Union en- vironmental regulations that enforce fixed grazing
boundaries]{.underline} \[100,68\]. [In Canadian Arctic, younger gen-
erations are]{.underline} increasingly [disconnected from traditional
hunting practices due to the influence of modern life- styles, climate
change, and the decline in wildlife po- pulations]{.underline}
\[56,81\]. [[This **loss of traditional knowledge** creates a
**barrier**]{.mark} [to adaptation, as communities **lose the ability to
respond effectively to changing environmental
conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The role of [gendered labour norms acts as a barrier and plays a
significant role in shaping adaptive capacity and
decision-making]{.underline}. [While men traditionally occupied roles as
hunters, herders, and fishermen, climate change is altering these
economic foundations, necessitating new employment
opportunities]{.underline} \[7\]. In Sami communities, men's ability to
continue reindeer herding is being un- dermined by shrinking pastures,
forcing women into new economic roles \[73\]. [In many Arctic
communities, women are leaving for education and employment op-
portunities, which can both mitigate and exacerbate
vulnerabilities]{.underline} \[12\]. While improved [education and job
access]{.underline} can enhance resilience, they [may]{.underline} also
[lead to the outmigration of skilled individuals, further straining
community cohesion and adaptive capacity]{.underline}. In Green- land,
many Indigenous women are leaving their communities to seek education
and employment in Denmark and urban areas, which provides economic
empowerment but also weakens intergenerational knowledge transfer and
community cohesion \[54,82\]. While these individual choices offer
economic mobility, they weaken the transmission of traditional
adaptation strategies, presenting both a barrier and a limit --- a limit
because the cultural shift away from subsistence prac- tices is often
irreversible.

[**Social norms** tied to traditional subsistence practices
are]{.underline} being [**fundamentally disrupted** by climate
change,]{.underline} [leading to limits on adaptation]{.underline}. [An
important example]{.underline} of this limit [is the loss of key
wildlife species essential to Indigenous diets and cultural
identity]{.underline}. The decline of caribou populations in the
Canadian Arctic has reached a point where some communities can no longer
rely on this culturally and nutritionally important species \[8,93\].
This represents a limit to adaptation, as the loss of car- ibou
undermines food security, cultural identity, and traditional practices,
significantly impacting Inuit com- munities. [[Conservation
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as restricting car- ibou hunting,
[[address ecological sustainability but force communities to abandon
traditional food-sharing net- works]{.underline}, [important for
survival and social cohesion]{.underline} \[42\]. In Gre]{.mark}enland,
Inuit hunters rely on sea ice for seal and whale hunting, which is
economically and culturally significant. However[, [with sea ice loss
accelerating, these traditional hunting grounds are
disappearing]{.underline} \[37\]. [This represents a limit --- without
ice, these practices cannot continue. This leads to both **food
insecurity** and **cultural erosion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Tribes need an overarching technical assistance program to streamline
access to resources.]{.underline} The [US Environmental Protection
Agency's selection of Environmental Justice Thriving Communities
Technical Assistance Centers, in partnership with the DOE, is a step in
the right direction.]{.underline} In addition, [a directory of federal
agencies and nonfederal entities that offer technical assistance is
needed, as are long-term funding streams to support tribal energy
champions]{.underline}. Further[, technical assistance targeted to
tribal energy projects should parallel support for broader climate
mitigation and adaptation.]{.underline}

A [targeted collection of resources and tools for tribes and tribal
partners will help improve access, translation, and education on climate
investments.]{.underline} The Access to Capital Clearinghouse created by
the White House Council on Native American Affairs and the US Department
of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs is now operational, providing
a searchable database of federal funding opportunities available to
tribes (*14*). More broadly, [tribes will benefit from a consolidated
database of funding opportunity announcements from the full spectrum of
federal, state, and philanthropic agencies, including funding levels,
requirements, and deadlines. This database could be developed and
maintained by the federal government or another entity.]{.underline}

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

[A **deep-rooted** **colonial mentality** that remains **pervasive** is
the assumed **supremacy** of a **Western knowledge
system**]{.underline}. [This creates a **paternalistic relationship**
wherein decisions are made by external 'experts' and imposed upon the
Indigenous population.]{.underline} In short, [Indigenous ways of
knowing are undermined.]{.underline}32) The term [Indigenous knowledge
is defined as "the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by
societies with long histories of interaction with their natural
surroundings".]{.underline}33) [[Efforts to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic must not only embrace these different
worldviews, perspectives, and knowledge systems, but **put them
first**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[There is]{.underline} also [[a tendency to assume that the only route
to]{.underline} achieving [greater material benefits]{.underline} or
power [is to adopt a capitalist
econom]{.underline}]{.mark}[y]{.underline}. What Aníbal Quijano---one of
the preeminent thinkers of decolonization theory---terms ['**[cultural
Europeanisation]{.underline}**]{.mark},' but can be understood as
colonial Western society more broadly, [[is taken as universal and
synonymous with being '**developed'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}34) Before
ANCSA was passed in 1971, Alaska Native populations had primarily
engaged in subsistence activities. Since the settlement of land claims
agreements, Alaska Native populations are increasingly entrenched in the
capitalist economy, especially via resource development. Today, most
Indigenous people in Alaska engage in a mixed economy, meaning a
combination of both subsistence and market-based activities.35[) [A
desire to obtain the benefits from natural resource extraction on
Indigenous lands is a primary reason for this growth in capitalist
engagement]{.underline}.36) [Through a decolonization lens, it is
understood that following the rhetoric and logic of Western society is a
way to "reach the same material benefits and the same power as the
Europeans: viz, to conquer nature in short for
'development'".]{.underline}37) [This model of
**development**]{.underline}, however, [has proven "**environmentally
calamitous on the global scale**",]{.underline}38) [made even more dire
by the rapid impact of climate change throughout the
Arctic]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Sovereignty and the prioritization of state interests

[To decolonize resource development]{.underline}, [Alaska Native
populations must have **greater control** over the process]{.underline}.
In other words, [one overarching aim of decolonization in practice is
**Indigenous sovereignty**.]{.underline} However, [**(neo)colonial
narratives** shape and are ingrained within the traditional concept of
**state-centered sovereignty**]{.underline}. Within this concept, [the
aims of the government are continually prioritized; a **hierarchy** is
established whereby the interests and concerns of the state are given
primacy]{.underline}.27) [This dynamic is]{.underline} one of the
reasons [why]{.underline}, in the case of Alaska and Alaska Native
populations, [resource development continues to be experienced as a
**colonial enterprise**]{.underline}. [The gains from extractive
activities do not necessarily or primarily benefit Alaska Native
populations]{.underline},28) [and the interests of outside actors are
prioritized]{.underline}.29) Oftentimes, [wealth]{.underline} from
resource development [has been extracted from northern regions to
benefit other populations]{.underline}.30) [An evaluation of the Red Dog
Mine]{.underline} in northwest Alaska, for instance, [found]{.underline}
[that the local population received a]{.underline} relatively [modest
share of benefits in terms of employment, income, and
mobility]{.underline}.31)

As established through ANCSA, the [Regional Corporations are the primary
route for Alaska Native participation in governing resource development
in the US Arctic. These corporations]{.underline}, however, [operate
under US corporate law and,]{.underline} therefore, [within the
**frameworks of the capitalist order**]{.underline}. Participation
through the structure of the [Regional Corporations]{.underline},
[thus]{.underline}, [limits the opportunity for Alaska Native
populations to achieve self-determination]{.underline} outside of those
conventions. In action, considering the embeddedness of the corporations
within the capitalist and colonial dynamics of the state,
[**decolonization** may necessitate **enhancing** the power of and
regard for **local governments** rather than governing resource
development principally through the Regional Corporations.]{.underline}

Extinction is not a metaphor...

[[Extinction]{.mark} has become an [emblem]{.mark} of **Western**, and
[**white-dominated**, **fears**]{.mark} about 'the end of the(ir)
world'.]{.underline} [This scientific term is [saturated with emotional
potency]{.mark}]{.underline}, [stretched and contorted to embody almost
any **nightmare**]{.underline}, [from climate change to asteroid
strikes.]{.underline} In academic and public contexts alike, [it is
regularly interchanged with other terms and concepts -- for instance,
'species death', global warming or ecological collapse.]{.underline}
[Diffused into sublime scales]{.underline} -- mass extinctions measured
in millions of (Gregorian calendar) years, a planet totalized by the
threat of nuclear destruction -- ['[extinction' has become an **empty
superlative**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [one that that gestures to an
abstract form of unthinkability.]{.underline} [It teases Western
subjects with images of generalized demise]{.underline} [that
might]{.underline}, if it gets bad enough, even [threaten]{.underline}
us, or [the figure of 'humanity']{.underline} that we enshrine as a
universal. [[This figure of 'humanity']{.mark},]{.underline} derived
from Western European enlightenment ideals, [[emphasizes]{.mark}
individual, autonomous actors who are fully integrated into the global
market system;]{.underline} [who are [responsible citizens of
nation-states]{.mark}]{.underline}; who conform to Western ideas of
health and well-being; who partake of 'culture'; who participate in
democratic state-based politics; who refrain from physical violence; and
who manage their 'resources' responsibly (Mitchell 2014).

Oddly, **[[exposure to the fear of extinction contributes to the
formation and bolstering of contemporary Western
subjects]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Contemplating the sublime destruction
of 'humanity' offers the thrill of abjection]{.underline}: the perverse
pleasure derived from exposure to something by which one is revolted.
Claire Colebrook detects this thrill-seeking impulse in the profusion of
Western blockbuster films and TV shows that imagine and envision the
destruction of earth, or at least of 'humanity'. It also throbs through
a flurry of recent best-selling books -- both fiction and speculative
non-fiction (see Oreskes and Conway 2014; Newitz 2013; Weisman 2008). In
a forthcoming intervention, Noah Theriault and I (2018) argue that
[[these imaginaries]{.mark} are a form of porn that [normalizes the
profound violences driving extinction,]{.mark} while cocooning its
viewers in the secure space of the voyeur.]{.underline} [Certainly,
there are many Western scientists, conservationists and policy-makers
who are genuinely committed to stopping the extinction of others,
perhaps out of fear for their own futures.]{.underline} [Yet
[**extinction is not quite real** for Western]{.mark}, and especially
white, [subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}[; [it is a **fantasy of negation**
that evokes **thrill**, **melancholy**, **anger** and **existential
purpose**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

It is a metaphor that expresses the destructive desires of these beings,
and the negativity against which we define our subjectivity.

But **[[extinction is not a metaphor]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[it is a
very real expression of violence that systematically destroys particular
beings, worlds, life forms and]{.mark} the [relations]{.mark} that
enable them to flourish.]{.underline} [These are real, unique beings,
worlds and relations]{.underline} -- as well as somebody's family,
Ancestors, siblings, future generations -- **[who are violently
destroyed.]{.underline}** [Extinction can only be used unironically as a
metaphor by people who have never been threatened with it, told it is
their inevitable fate, or lost their relatives and Ancestors to it --
and who assume that they probably never will.]{.underline}

This argument is directly inspired by the call to arms issued in 2012 by
Eve Tuck and Wayne K. Yang and more recently by Cutcha Risling-Baldy.
The first, seminal piece demonstrates how settler cultures use the
violence of metaphorical abstraction to excuse themselves from the real
work of decolonization: ensuring that land and power is in Indigenous
hands. Risling-Baldy's brilliant follow-up extends this logic to explain
how First People like Coyote have been reduced to metaphors through
settler appropriation. In both cases, [engagement with Indigenous
peoples and their relations masks moves to innocence: acts that make it
appear as if settlers are engaging in decolonization, while in fact we
are consolidating the power structures that privilege us.]{.underline}

In this series, want to show how [Western, and white-dominated,
[discourses on 'extinction']{.mark} [appear to address]{.mark} the
[systematic destruction]{.mark} of peoples and other beings [while
enacting moves to innocence]{.mark} [that mask]{.mark} their
[culpability]{.mark} [and perpetuate structures of
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline} As I argued in Part I of this series,
**[[extinction is an expression of colonial
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As such, [it needs to be addressed
through direct **decolonization**, including the **dismantling** of
**settler colonial structures of violence**, and the resurgence of
Indigenous worlds.]{.underline} Following Tuck, Yang and Risling-Baldy's
lead, [I want to show how and why the violences that drive extinction
have come to be invisible within mainstream discourses.]{.underline}
[Salient amongst these is the practice of genocide against Indigenous
peoples other than humans.]{.underline}

...it is literally genocide.

[What Western science calls 'extinction']{.underline} is not an
unfortunate, unintended consequence of desirable 'human' activities. It
[is an embodiment of particular patterns of structural violence that
disproportionately affect specific racialized groups.]{.underline} [In
some cases,]{.underline} ['extinction' is directly, **deliberately** and
**systematically** **inflicted** in order to create space for
aggressors, including **settler states**.]{.underline} For this reason,
[it has rightly been framed as an aspect or tool of colonial genocides
against Indigenous human peoples.]{.underline} Indeed, many theorists
have shown that [the 'extirpation' of life forms]{.underline} (their
total removal from a particular place) [is an instrument for enacting
genocide upon Indigenous humans]{.underline} (see Mazis 2008; Laduke
1999; Stannard 1994). Specifically, the removal of key sources of food,
clothing and other basic materials makes survival on the land impossible
for the people targeted.

3.3 Discussion: improving domestic diplomacy

[Public institutions do not interact as sovereign bodies in a
frictionless medium.]{.underline} [There are forces at play that operate
at more mundane levels than policy itself.]{.underline} [**Governments**
are **not** things that can be **separated** from the complex world of
**human relationships**]{.underline}; they are made up of people,
computers, intermittent phone connections, hearing aids, and a whole
host of human and more-than-human components (Abrams 1988). The actual
practice of [how governments]{.underline}---federal, Tribal, state, and
regional---[communicate with each other is "messy"]{.underline} (Law
2004). And [**messiness is not apolitical**; it entrenches existing
power structures]{.underline}. [The neglect of
micropolitics]{.underline}, which is one form of this messiness, [leads
to **chronically poor relationships** and **ineffective communication**
between Alaska Native communities and their governments.]{.underline}

[Unaddressed, micropolitics may **prevent** Indigenous communities from
engaging on **equal footing** with the systems designed to serve them.
This **disparages** their **sovereignty**.]{.underline} [These
relationships]{.underline}, in order to succeed, [must be built on a
foundation of mutual trust and understanding]{.underline}. Potawatomi
scholar Kyle Whyte notes that "lessons from generations of colonialism
about how to avert bad relationship-making have not been learned by the
parties who should have learned them" (2020; p. 5). These [institutional
failures are not the responsibility of Tribes to address]{.underline}
(e.g., through "capacity building" as a self-contained remedy); [framing
them as such inappropriately accepts a logic that makes colonized
communities responsible for overcoming their own
marginalization]{.underline} (Kashwan and Ribot 2021).

It would be wrong to identify these issues as simple matters of policy
implementation. Rather, [these phenomena are **rooted** in deep
**structures of colonialism** and racism.]{.underline} The context of
"natural" disasters often gives false cover to the violent origins of
environmental vulnerability (Marino 2012; Marino et al. 2022). [In the
case of Alaska Native villages, their current precarity is not an issue
of bad geographical luck; rather, it's political all the way
down]{.underline}.

programs.]{.underline} In March, the EPA froze the funds --- including
accounts held at Citibank --- and formally terminated the grants. A U.S.
District Court quickly issued a temporary restraining order, finding the
EPA acted unlawfully. The EPA's attempt to overturn that ruling is still

In addition to cutting key tax credits and grant programs, [[HR 1

characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The importance]{.mark} of the
Arctic [extends beyond its immediate geographic
boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [influencing weather patterns, oceanic
circulation, and global temperature regulation]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Understanding the Arctic's role in the climate system [is [crucial for
comprehending the broader impacts of climate change and developing
strategies to mitigate its effects]{.underline}]{.mark} \[70\]. [The
[Arctic's high albedo]{.mark}, or reflectivity, is a c[ritical]{.mark}
[factor in regulating the]{.mark} [Earth's energy
balance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Snow and ice surfaces reflect a
significant portion of incoming solar radiation back into space, helping
to cool the planet[[. As climate change leads to the melting of Arctic
ice, the albedo effect diminishes]{.underline},]{.mark} resulting in
increased absorption of solar radiation by darker ocean and land
surfaces. [[This positive feedback loop accelerates regional and global
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} \[38\]. [The ice-albedo feedback mechanism
is a [key]{.mark} [driver of Arctic amplification]{.mark}, where the
region warms at a faster rate than the global average]{.underline}. As
ice and snow melt, exposed surfaces absorb more heat, leading to further
melting and warming. [This process not only affects the Arctic but also
[contributes to global temperature rise and climate
variability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Arctic is]{.underline}
[integral]{.underline}]{.mark} to the global thermohaline circulation,
also known as the [["ocean conveyor belt.]{.underline}"]{.mark} This
circulation is driven by differences in water density, influenced by
temperature and salinity. Cold, dense water in the Arctic sinks and
flows southward, driving deep ocean currents that help regulate global
climate by redistributing heat and nutrients. [[Disruptions to this
circulation due to Arctic warming and freshwater input from melting ice
can have far-reaching effects on climate patterns and marine
ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}. The melting of Arctic sea ice and
glaciers contributes to an influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic.
This influx [can alter ocean salinity and stratification,]{.underline}
impacting thermohaline circulation. Changes in this circulation can
[affect weather patterns]{.underline}, including the strength and
position of the Gulf Stream, which plays a crucial role in moderating
the climate of Europe and North America[. [The Arctic influences
atmospheric circulation]{.underline}]{.mark}[, particularly the
[behavior of the polar]{.mark} [jet stream]{.mark},]{.underline} a
fast-fowing ribbon of air that encircles the polar region. [Warming in
the Arctic can weaken the temperature gradient between the poles and the
equator, leading to a slower and more meandering jet
stream]{.underline}. This can [[result in extreme weather
events,]{.underline}]{.mark} such as prolonged cold spells, heatwaves,
and heavy precipitation, affecting midlatitude regions \[11\]. The
Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a climate pattern characterized by the
fluctuation of atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and
mid-latitudes. Changes in the AO can influence weather patterns across
the Northern Hemisphere. A positive phase of the AO is associated with a
stronger polar vortex and milder winter conditions in the mid-latitudes,
while a negative phase can lead to colder and more severe winters.
[[Arctic warming can impact the dynamics of the AO, contributing to
increased climate variability.]{.underline} The [Arctic is a significant
carbon sink]{.underline}]{.mark}, with vast amounts of carbon stored in
permafrost and tundra ecosystems. Thawing permafrost due to rising
temperatures releases stored carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into
the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and further
accelerating global warming. [This [release of greenhouse gases]{.mark}
[from the Arctic]{.mark} has the potential to create a
feedback]{.underline} [loop, [amplifying]{.mark} climate change
[impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a
much higher warming potential than CO2 over short time scales. [The
Arctic contains [large reserves of methane in permafrost and
methane]{.mark} [hydrate]{.mark}]{.underline}[s.]{.mark} As permafrost
[[thaws]{.underline}]{.mark}, these methane reserves can be released,
significantly [enhancing the greenhouse effect and [contributing to
abrupt climate changes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic hosts unique and
diverse ecosystems that provide critical services, such as carbon
sequestration, habitat for wildlife, and support for indigenous
communities. [These [ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate
change]{.mark}, with shifts in species]{.underline} [distributions, loss
of sea ice habitat, and alterations in food webs [impacting biodiversity
and ecosystem functionality]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arctic [indigenous
communities rely on the region's natural resources for their cultural,
economic, and social well-being]{.mark}]{.underline}. Climate change and
its impacts on the Arctic environment threaten traditional livelihoods,
food security, and cultural heritage. [Understanding and addressing
these impacts is essential for supporting the resilience and
sustainability of Arctic communities]{.underline}. [The Arctic is a
crucial component of the global climate system, influencing energy
balance, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, carbon and methane cycles,
and biodiversity]{.underline}. The rapid changes occurring in the Arctic
due to climate change have profound implications for global climate
patterns, weather extremes, and ecosystem health[. [Recognizing the
interconnectedness of the Arctic with the rest of the planet underscores
the importance of mitigating climate change and protecting this vital
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Efforts to reduce]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions,]{.mark} [preserve Arctic ecosystems]{.mark}, and [support

An estimated [10 percent of the nearly four million residents throughout
the entire Arctic region are Indigenous]{.underline}.1) Indigenous
populations have inhabited much of the Arctic for thousands of years,
long before the land was claimed and divided into nation-states.
Interest in opportunities for natural resource extraction drove the
historic colonization in the Arctic2) and, [today, the
increasing]{.underline} [accessibility of minerals and oil due to
climate change is fuelling the]{.underline} so-called "**[Arctic
resource boom]{.underline}**"3)---[a quest to]{.underline} find and
**[exploit]{.underline}** [the region's remaining
resources.]{.underline} [As more international players hope to
participate in Arctic affairs, it is **critical** to not only consider
how these ventures impact **Indigenous populations** but to prioritize
**decolonization** in these spaces]{.underline}.

[Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic]{.underline}
than in any other part of the world, with the most recent evidence
pointing to a rate of warming nearly four times greater than the global
average.4) This [warming is driving the thawing of permafrost, loss of
seasonal snow cover, and melting of sea ice, ice caps and glaciers;
each,]{.underline} in turn, [increasing the **accessibility** of
**natural resources** and growing **global interest** in the
Arctic]{.underline}.5) This article uses a decolonization framework to
analyze resource development with a focus on the United States (US),
which is considered an Arctic state by way of Alaska. [Decolonization
will be defined as a concept and practice of confronting and reversing
the historic and ongoing legacies of colonialism,]{.underline}6)
[including the structures of power that uphold
inequalities]{.underline}.

After a brief background covering land ownership and some of the
outcomes of resource development in Alaska, this article will delve into
dynamics that reproduce and perpetuate colonial structures of power.
This analysis will feature (i) the prioritization of state and federal
interests through the idea of sovereignty and (ii) the primacy and
assumed superiority of Western knowledge and conventions and,
conversely, the disregard for Indigenous knowledge systems and
worldviews. To bridge the gap between theory and action, the article
will continually ask what it would mean to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic. [**Confronting** the ongoing systems and
dynamics of **colonialism** must be placed at the **forefront** of
present-day and future Arctic engagement and
collaboration]{.underline}---not only in the US, but [throughout the
region]{.underline}

Background

The United States purchased the land that is present-day Alaska from
Russia in 1867. Just over a century later, in 1968, the discovery of oil
in Prudhoe Bay made the Arctic relevant at a national scale.7) The
commercial export of oil to the lower 48 states was now possible for the
first time. Hindering this ambition, however, was the fact that the
planned pipeline to carry the oil south traversed lands claimed by
Alaska Native populations. 'Alaska Native' refers collectively to the
Indigenous populations who have lived in present-day Alaska for
thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the 1700s.8) This
term encompasses "many nations and tribes" and "widely diverse cultures,
languages, lifeways, art forms and histories".9) To enable the
construction of the pipeline to the contiguous United States, land
claims issues around Prudhoe Bay were settled with the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971. ANCSA extinguished Indigenous
claims to nearly 400 million acres of land throughout the state in
exchange for \$962.5 million and ownership of 43.7 million acres.

ANCSA also divided the state into twelve regions, each with an Alaska
Native Regional Corporation. The regional boundaries of the corporations
do not, however, equate to land ownership; land in Alaska is
predominantly owned by the state and federal governments. Just 10
percent of Alaska's 663,000 square miles are owned by Alaska Native
populations.10) The Regional Corporations operate under US corporate law
to administer resources and serve the local communities. These
for-profit corporations participate in the Alaskan natural resource
industry, both directly and indirectly.

[Federal Arctic policy in the US]{.underline} [has tended to
emphasize]{.underline} the [exploitation]{.underline} [of Arctic
resources for US economic development]{.underline}.11) W[ithin the new
National Strategy for the Arctic Region]{.underline} (released October
2022), [economic development continues to receive a strong
emphasis---alongside security---and Arctic investments are expected to
increase over the following decade]{.underline}.12) In the face of this
ever-growing interest in Arctic engagement, [Alaska Native
communities]{.underline} may [face new and renewed **colonial
intrusion** in the form of **large-scale resource
development**]{.underline}.13)

Effects of resource development

Continual '[**boom and bust**']{.underline} [with periods of financial
growth and decline characterizes resource development in the
**capitalist system**]{.underline}.14) This [instability]{.underline}
[prohibits]{.underline} many [communities from relying]{.underline}
solely [on economies centered on resource extraction]{.underline}.
[Subsistence practices provide a source of greater
stability]{.underline} within what would otherwise be an unstable
extractive economy.15) [**Resource extraction** has]{.underline},
however, [had **detrimental impacts** on the land, water, and wildlife
that reduce the viability of subsistence lifeways.]{.underline}
Specifically, [extractive activities have been found to **increase**
**vulnerability** to **biological invasion**]{.underline},16) [bring
changes to the land with built infrastructure]{.underline},17) [and
introduce the risk of contamination, such as **oil
spills**]{.underline}.18) [The resulting decreased viability of
subsistence practices is worsened by the threat climate change poses to
hunting and gathering activities]{.underline}.19)

Although some measures of physical health have improved since ANCSA,20)
[resource extraction can compromise the **health** and **wellbeing** of
nearby Indigenous populations.]{.underline} [Significant health
disparities remain among Alaska Natives compared to
non-native]{.underline} Alaskans and other US [residents]{.underline}.
Generally, [Alaska Natives have a **lower life expectancy**, increased
risk of **cardiovascular disease**, and an **elevated burden of
infectious disease**.]{.underline}21) [By exacerbating **food
insecurity**, the negative impacts of resource development may
contribute to and **worsen health outcomes**.]{.underline}
[Many]{.underline} of these disparities [are rooted in]{.underline} the
history of [colonialism]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [socio-political
marginalization]{.underline}; in addition, [their persistence today may
be attributed to the disproportionate exposure to environmental health
hazards]{.underline}.22) Moreover, some researchers have found that
[health data fails to produce a holistic picture of well-being,
suggesting that there must be a greater consideration for
context-specific understandings of health status]{.underline}.23)

Importantly, [the effects of resource development are not felt uniformly
by Alaska Natives]{.underline}. Instead, [various facets of identity
among individuals and communities impact how they relate to extractive
activities]{.underline}. [Socioeconomic class divisions]{.underline},24)
[gender identity]{.underline},25) [one's location in a rural versus
urban setting]{.underline},26) [and many other factors can all impact
how resource development is experienced]{.underline}. [The
**complexity** of the relationship]{.underline} between resource
development and Indigenous populations, and the diversity within the
Alaska Native population, [**must not be ignored** or
simplified]{.underline}.

Introduction

[[The **Arctic** is experiencing the **fastest warming in the
world**]{.underline}]{.mark}, warming [[at a rate]{.underline} [nearly
four times faster than the global average]{.underline},]{.mark} a
phenomenon [[known as **Arctic Amplification**]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[••85\], [with]{.underline} potential [i[mpacts]{.mark} **[beyond its
borders]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[••74\]. [[Climate change is having
**widespread im- pacts** on ecosystem services and communities,
including **sea ice loss**, increasing risk of **mass casualty**
incidents, **rising temperature**, **thawing permafrost**, **food
insecurity**, and im- pacts on **livelihoods** and culture of
**Indigenous commu- nities**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[••14,••2,66\]. [The
Arctic has a population of]{.underline} approximately [4
million]{.underline} people, of whom approximately [10% are
Indigenous]{.underline}, living in Alaska, Canada, Finland, Greenland,
Norway, Russia, and Sweden \[••65\]. [[In- digenous Peoples have
historically adapted through]{.underline}]{.mark} the combination of
[[traditional knowledge, sharing networks, mobility, and
technology]{.underline} \[70\] [yet face **significant con- straints**
in a contemporary context]{.underline}]{.mark} \[22\].

[[Barriers are **systemic obstacles** that **hamper progress** to- wards
effective adaptation but **can be overcome**]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[98\]. Limits are thresholds, inherent restrictions, and points beyond
which social or ecological systems cannot adapt without significant
transformation or collapse or beyond which no more adaptation is
possible \[40,••45\]. [Barriers and limits to adaptation
have]{.underline} largely [been associated with a range of
socioeconomic, cultural, institutional, and biophysical factors and
are]{.underline} strongly [influenced by the rates at which
climate-influenced risks emerge and the pace at which adaptive changes
can be made]{.underline} \[••3,62,64,67,98\].

Barriers and limits to adaptation in the Arctic are not entirely
negative; while many restrict adaptation, others serve protective
socioecological functions. [**Environmental limits**, such as extreme
cold, permafrost, and remoteness, **discourage** large-scale
**industrialisation** and mass in-mi- gration, sustaining Arctic
ecosystems and Indigenous subsistence practices]{.underline} \[49\].
[[Regulatory barriers]{.underline}]{.mark}, like wild- life protection
laws and fishing quotas, prevent over- harvesting and support long-term
ecological sustainability \[105\], though they [[can become restrictive
when imposed without Indigenous input or community
engagement]{.underline}.]{.mark}

While studies have extensively documented climate change impacts and
adaptation strategies in the Arctic \[18,27,34,36,49\], less attention
has been given to iden- tifying barriers and limits to adaptation,
particularly for Indigenous communities. This paper aims to fulfil this
gap by identifying and characterising potential barriers and limits to
adaptation for Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic. This study illustrates
the significance of these [[barriers and limits]{.underline}]{.mark}
through selected examples that highlight their diverse manifestations
across Arctic regions. These examples [[illustrate the complexity of
adaptation challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}, providing a framework for
ana- lysing barriers and limits in specific geographic and so-
ciopolitical contexts. This paper examines how [social norms, individual
values, psychosocial factors, and [gov- ernance systems create barriers
and limits across Arctic regions]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
following the structure outlined in Table 1.

#### \*In fact, current development and resource extraction ignores Indigenous governance systems that advocate for sustainable resource management -- only the aff solves

[Many national [governments prioritise **neoliberal devel- opment** and
**resource extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline} (mining, oil, and gas),
[[while **Indigenous governance** systems advocate for **sus- tainable
resource management**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[103,••32,92\]. In Norway,
the government's focus on oil and gas development often conflicts with
Indigenous demands for sustainable re- source management \[33\]. [[This
prioritisation of resource extraction over environmental and cultural
preservation acts as a barrier to adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
Russia, large-scale oil and gas projects --- such as those in the Yamal
Peninsula --- have led to forced relocations of Nenets and Evenki
reindeer herders, significantly reducing their ability to maintain
traditional migration routes \[107,44\]. [In Alaska and Canada,
governments continue to grant resource ex- traction permits on
Indigenous lands, despite widespread resistance from Indigenous
communities]{.underline} \[28,5\]. The oil drilling Willow Project in
Alaska, approved in 2023, has faced intense opposition from Indigenous
activists who argue that it will increase environmental destruction,
disrupt wildlife migration patterns, and accelerate per- mafrost thawing
\[31\]. However, the project was still ap- proved, highlighting how
governance systems frequently privilege economic interests over
Indigenous sovereignty and long-term climate resilience.

[[**Indigenous communities** are often **marginalised** in **gov-
ernance**, **decision-making processes**, **adaptation plan- ning**, and
**consultation** in resource extraction and face **challenges** in
asserting their rights and interests]{.underline}]{.mark} \[103,97\].
[[This **exclusion** creates **significant barriers** to
adaptation]{.mark}, [as policies that do not incorporate Indigenous
perspec- tives often fail to address the realities of Arctic
life]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Many of [[the **governance failures** in the Arctic are **rooted** in
historical and ongoing **colonialism**, resulting in land dispossession
and forced relocation, which have collec- tively impeded
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in certain cases, [[severed the im- portant
connections of Indigenous Peoples with their ancestral
territories]{.underline}]{.mark} \[47,••65\]. In many cases, these co-
lonial structures do not just act as barriers but as limits --- where
Indigenous communities have permanently lost land, mobility, and
self-governance, making adaptation fundamentally more difficult. [In
Canada and [Alaska]{.mark}, many [Indigenous communities were forcibly
relocated to permanent settlements, disrupting lifestyles, tradi- tional
hunting practices, and climate-adaptive mobility
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline} [\[]{.mark}17,69\]. [[These relocations
have had lasting im- pacts on food security, mental health, and cultural
pre- servation, creating a structural limit to adaptation]{.underline}
\[25\].]{.mark}

[[Colonialism and injustice have evolved into government policies
limiting access to resources]{.underline}]{.mark} such as small-scale
Indigenous Peoples' fisheries and favouring offshore traw- lers,
resulting in historical and present-day inequities in the fishing sector
\[94\]. [Historical, interpersonal, epistemic, and systemic racism has
created socioeconomic disparities, lim- iting access to health care,
education, resources, and eco- nomic opportunities and affected the
health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} \[24,••59\].
[This presents a limit and undermines the adaptive
capacity]{.underline}.

[[**Colonisation** has systematically **turned** the natural con-
straints in the Arctic into **severe socioeconomic barriers** by
**undermining** Indigenous **autonomy** and **severing traditional
adaptation strategies**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[••65\]. Forced se-
dentarisation, land dispossession, and restrictive re- source governance
have stripped Indigenous communities of their ability to flexibly
respond to en- vironmental challenges \[104\]. [[Colonial policies have
re- inforced]{.underline} the [infrastructural
limitations]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- [investing in resource extraction
rather than local development, leaving Indigenous communities with high
costs of living, food insecurity, and limited access to essential
service]{.mark}s]{.underline} \[55,90\]. [[What were once manageable
ecological limits have thus been compounded by imposed social,
political, and economic constraints, shaping the struc- tural
inequalities that define contemporary Arctic adap- tation
challenges]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[Colonialism has created both barriers and limits to adaptation by
forcibly relocating Indigenous commu- nities to environmentally
unsuitable and high-risk areas]{.underline}, where traditional hunting
and fishing practices are no longer viable. While initially a barrier,
this [displacement has evolved into a structural limit, as these
communities are now deeply established, making relocation im- practical
despite increasing climate risks]{.underline}. State-imposed wildlife
regulations restrict Indigenous adaptive flex- ibility, preventing
communities from adjusting their subsistence practices in response to
environmental changes \[22\]. These [[policies]{.underline}, often
[designed without Indigenous input]{.underline}, [reinforce colonial
constraints on adaptation, further limiting the agency of Arctic In-
digenous Peoples in navigating climate challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[geopolitical competition]{.underline}]{.mark} among major powers
such as the United States, Russia, Canada, and China; the [[esca- lation
of military operations]{.underline} by Arctic nations; the ex[- pansion
of commercial shipping routes through the Arctic]{.underline}; [and the
exploration of oil, gas, and mineral resources]{.underline} [have
emerged as important limits affecting Arctic governance and
adaptation]{.underline} \[]{.mark}30,79\]. The geopolitics of the Arctic
has gained global attention due to climate change, resulting in
increased interest in commercial shipping and energy resources \[95\].
The reduction of sea ice has triggered a surge in human activities where
countries and corpora- tions vie for control over resources and shipping
routes, diverting attention and resources for adaptation. This is
exacerbated by increasing militarisation of the Arctic \[101\],
affecting environmental and human sustainability and security and
long-term adaptation planning. Russia has significantly expanded
military bases in the Arctic, while the U.S. and NATO allies have
increased defence spending \[57\]. This geopolitical tension reduces
interna- tional cooperation on climate adaptation, as nations prioritise
strategic control over adaptation funding and environmental protection.
Geopolitical competition is a structural limit, as it shifts governance
priorities away from climate resilience and human security and toward
national security concerns.

Conclusion

[[Addressing barriers and limits to climate change adap- tation requires
transformative structural changes that recognise Indigenous rights,
knowledge, and sover- eignty, and a move towards **inclusive
governance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These changes can be achieved
through targeted policies and frameworks]{.underline},]{.mark} such as
the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development Working Group, [which
facilitates colla- boration on climate resilience strategies grounded in
Indigenous knowledge.]{.underline} [Initiatives like co-management
agreements between Indigenous communities and na- tional governments
provide effective models for fos- tering inclusive
decision-making.]{.underline} [[Investing in **resilient
infrastructure**, promoting **Indigenous knowledge sys- tems**, and
ensuring **social** and **economic equity** are im- portant steps toward
**enhancing adaptation capacity** and **long-term sustainability** in
the Arctic]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Conceptualizing Indigenous sovereignty

[Notions of Indigenous sovereignty are connected to]{.underline} the
right to [self-determination]{.underline}. [[Decolonization
must]{.underline} [seek the conceptualization and expression of
Indigenous sovereignty **outside** of the **western hegemony** and
enduring **colonial structures**]{.underline}; [self-determination and
sovereignty are limited when they can only be articulated within the
existing capitalist order]{.underline}]{.mark}.39) Dr. Melanie K. Yazzie
presents the idea of [[anti-capitalist decolonization]{.underline} to
[challenge the "hegemonic formation of 'extractivism' and its liberal,
capitalist, heteropatriarchal, and settler colonial valance of
development"]{.underline}.40) [This approach to decolonization seems
especially well suited to the Alaskan context as it critiques how
resource development is carried out in a capitalist system]{.underline},
[instead of presenting resource extraction as]{.underline}]{.mark}
something [[inherently at odds with indigeneity]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Indigenous sovereignty is reliant on the ability of communities to have
autonomy over their resources and decision-making, as they have for
thousands of years.41) [[An anti-capitalist approach to decolonization
offers a way to center Indigenous epistemologies and enable economic,
societal, cultural, and political pathways conceptualized and
implemented by Alaska Native people themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The ideas presented throughout this article are applicable well beyond
the US Arctic, and beyond the realm of resource development. [[Interest
in **exploiting natural resources** drove historic **colonization**
throughout the **entire Arctic region** and the lingering structures and
systems of power]{.mark} continue to shape Indigenous lives and limit
the capacity of communities and individuals to mold their own
destinies]{.underline}. Therefore, [[interrogating and confronting the
ongoing systems and dynamics of colonialism **must be prioritized**
within Arctic engagement and collaboration going
forward]{.underline}]{.mark}. In light of the new National Strategy for
the Arctic Region---which differs, in one way, from the prior 2013
edition in making no mention of oil or gas42)---[there is a need for
further research and analysis to identify]{.underline} the implications
of this new strategy on [efforts to decolonize and achieve Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}[. [There is also a need to **center** and
**privilege Indigenous voices** in this space and, as such, **future
research** must be **informed** and **conceptualized** by and for
**Arctic Indigenous populations**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

transition? Lessons from community consultation and consent in the
circumpolar Arctic", Energy Research & Social Science, 22 January 2025,

In recent years[, the Arctic]{.underline} and sub-[Arctic regions have
seen an increased interest in investment in mining and low-carbon energy
infrastructure]{.underline}. As Fig. 2 shows, [at least 80 % of
low-carbon energy]{.underline} (all stages from planning to operating[)
and mineral]{.underline} (including exploration, construction,
operating, closure, and abandonment) [projects are intersected with
territories where diverse circumpolar Indigenous people's' languages are
spoken and Indigenous peoples hold land based rights, interests, and
knowledges]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} number [could be even
higher, as the absence of Indigenous languages on the map does not
necessary mean there are no Indigenous peoples or land rights. And it is
likely that extractive and energy industries will expand]{.underline},
be it deep seabed mineral exploration, rare earths mining, wind energy
generation, storage, and transmission and transportation infrastructure.
[Among multiple drivers behind this increase are energy security
concerns, global geopolitical re-alignments, and numerous policies and
strategic documents]{.underline}, including the European Green Deal
(2020), the European Critical Raw Materials Act (2023), the US's
Inflation Reduction Act (2022), and Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy
(2023), among others[.]{.underline}

While these documents underscore the importance of balancing economic
development with social and environmental goals, [there is a need to
bring light to the distribution of burdens and opportunities of energy
transition in the circumpolar north. Central to this understanding is
that energy transitions in the circumpolar north are deeply intertwined
with the history of colonialism]{.underline}, as it continues to shape
the region's environmental and sociopolitical landscape[. Colonial
policies have been prioritizing extractive industries]{.underline} (such
as fur trading, mining, forestry, hydropower and oil extraction) [in the
region perceived as the "terra nullius", expropriating lands, and
marginalising Indigenous communities. Ongoing energy transitions are
intensifying resource extraction against the legacy of historical and
existing extractive industries and reproducing colonial attitudes as
decision-making continues to exclude Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

[These dynamics have led to the framing of the region as a "green
sacrifice zone", providing a deep interrogation of neocolonial, racial,
cultural, and environmental underpinnings of making "green" industrial
economies. The concept of "sacrifice zones" has gained popularity in the
US regarding nuclear testing locations, waste sites and extractive
regions, which are "sacrificed" for a higher purpose in the name of
profit and progress, highlighting environments and populations that are
marginalised.]{.underline} The value of its application in the Arctic
context is that it "helps to see how the participation and distribution
of burdens and benefits are understood and considered" given the impacts
of industrial projects on communities driven by top-down policies and
the global demand for resources and low-carbon energy[. Issues of a just
energy transition in the Arctic have received increasing attention, with
the calls for evaluation of existing projects, legal instruments and
policy frameworks, as well as identification of gaps and areas for
improvement.]{.underline} This review addresses these needs.

Social norms

The inherent challenges of living in the Arctic constrain human
settlement, infrastructure, and economic activity. [Extreme climatic
conditions and short growing seasons render large-scale agriculture
unviable, necessitating reliance on subsistence practices or imported
food]{.underline} \[22,46\]. [**Sparse population** and]{.underline}
vast **[geographic expanses]{.underline}** significantly [**limit** the
**feasibility** of shared infrastructure]{.underline}, such as extensive
road networks and power grids, [in- creasing the **cost** and
**logistical complexity** of economic development]{.underline} \[11\].
[However, these]{.underline} same [conditions have historically provided
**ecological** and **cultural** **advantages for Indigenous
communities.**]{.underline} [Sparse human populations relative to
abundant fish and wildlife have sustained traditional subsistence
economies, ensuring food se- curity through hunting, fishing, and
herding]{.underline} \[23\]. [**The vast, open landscapes have
facilitated mobility, enabling seasonal resource access and fostering
resilient adapta- tion strategies**.]{.underline}

[[The **loss of traditional knowledge** is an **important barrier** to
**adaptation** in the Arctic.]{.underline} [External pressures such as
**globalisation** cause resource extraction, displacement, and
environmental degradation, impacting Indigenous knowledge systems,
cultural practices, languages, and institutions]{.underline} \[21\],
hence [perpetuating **epistemic injustice**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Economic and environmental changes exacerbate this, causing
generational discontinuities in the transfer of traditional knowledge to
younger generations]{.underline} \[]{.mark}81\]. [[There is **limited
prioritisation** of Indigenous Peoples in adaptation policy development
and support to respond to climate impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[10,13\]. [The [**lack of engagement** and **exclusion** of
**Indigenous Peoples**, **knowledge**, and **per- spectives** from
policy formulations]{.mark} [is a **barrier** that affects the
implementation of effective culturally sensitive adaptation strategies
and]{.mark} [policies tailored and relevant to Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} \[49,87\].

[**Cultural practices** such as sharing networks, communal hunting, oral
traditions, storytelling, and connections to the land and ocean are
**affected** by loss of traditional hunting grounds and wildlife due to
**climate change impacts**]{.underline} \[29\], [affecting **food
security** and weakening **community agency**, **cultural identity**,
**resilience**, and **adaptive capacity**]{.underline}. [[Indigenous
knowledge systems are **important** for adaptation and are **at risk**
due to cultural assimilation, modernisation, generational gaps, and
transformative environmental changes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[108,77\].
[[This loss creates **barriers**]{.underline}, [as it **reduces adaptive
capacity** and **coping mechanisms**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[undermining
the ability of com- munities to respond effectively to changing climatic
conditions.]{.underline} [It reduces sustainable resource
management]{.underline}]{.mark} [and adaptive capacities and practices
where [commu- nities could potentially lose critical insights that
inform locally appropriate and culturally sensitive adaptation
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} \[23,87\].

In Scandinavia, [[Sami herding traditions]{.underline}, [which involve
adaptive rotational grazing to maintain reindeer popula-
tions]{.underline},]{.mark} [are]{.underline} often [disregarded in
conservation planning.]{.underline} [Instead, policymakers prioritise
European Union en- vironmental regulations that enforce fixed grazing
boundaries]{.underline} \[100,68\]. [In Canadian Arctic, younger gen-
erations are]{.underline} increasingly [disconnected from traditional
hunting practices due to the influence of modern life- styles, climate
change, and the decline in wildlife po- pulations]{.underline}
\[56,81\]. [[This **loss of traditional knowledge** creates a
**barrier**]{.mark} [to adaptation, as communities **lose the ability to
respond effectively to changing environmental
conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The role of [gendered labour norms acts as a barrier and plays a
significant role in shaping adaptive capacity and
decision-making]{.underline}. [While men traditionally occupied roles as
hunters, herders, and fishermen, climate change is altering these
economic foundations, necessitating new employment
opportunities]{.underline} \[7\]. In Sami communities, men's ability to
continue reindeer herding is being un- dermined by shrinking pastures,
forcing women into new economic roles \[73\]. [In many Arctic
communities, women are leaving for education and employment op-
portunities, which can both mitigate and exacerbate
vulnerabilities]{.underline} \[12\]. While improved [education and job
access]{.underline} can enhance resilience, they [may]{.underline} also
[lead to the outmigration of skilled individuals, further straining
community cohesion and adaptive capacity]{.underline}. In Green- land,
many Indigenous women are leaving their communities to seek education
and employment in Denmark and urban areas, which provides economic
empowerment but also weakens intergenerational knowledge transfer and
community cohesion \[54,82\]. While these individual choices offer
economic mobility, they weaken the transmission of traditional
adaptation strategies, presenting both a barrier and a limit --- a limit
because the cultural shift away from subsistence prac- tices is often
irreversible.

[**Social norms** tied to traditional subsistence practices
are]{.underline} being [**fundamentally disrupted** by climate
change,]{.underline} [leading to limits on adaptation]{.underline}. [An
important example]{.underline} of this limit [is the loss of key
wildlife species essential to Indigenous diets and cultural
identity]{.underline}. The decline of caribou populations in the
Canadian Arctic has reached a point where some communities can no longer
rely on this culturally and nutritionally important species \[8,93\].
This represents a limit to adaptation, as the loss of car- ibou
undermines food security, cultural identity, and traditional practices,
significantly impacting Inuit com- munities. [[Conservation
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as restricting car- ibou hunting,
[[address ecological sustainability but force communities to abandon
traditional food-sharing net- works]{.underline}, [important for
survival and social cohesion]{.underline} \[42\]. In Gre]{.mark}enland,
Inuit hunters rely on sea ice for seal and whale hunting, which is
economically and culturally significant. However[, [with sea ice loss
accelerating, these traditional hunting grounds are
disappearing]{.underline} \[37\]. [This represents a limit --- without
ice, these practices cannot continue. This leads to both **food
insecurity** and **cultural erosion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\*IEL = international environmental law

[The Arctic]{.underline} region [showcases the most severe environmental
consequences of global actions and decisions taken elsewhere, but it
could also play a leading role for a radical turn in the anthropocentric
trajectories that led it to its current state of
vulnerability,]{.underline} including in the multilevel legal and policy
frameworks that enabled it. As [Tennberg notes, "\[political\] and
economic development of the Arctic is increasingly intertwined with
politics beyond the region, and its governance is
decentralized]{.underline}, taking place locally, nationally, regionally
and globally."

[In manifesting the decentralised character of Arctic governance, the
green transition presents the Arctic as a key and attractive partner for
its implementation.]{.underline} However, [the rapidly changing Arctic
environment facing snow cover decrease, thawing permafrost and rapidly
melting sea ice, increases the accessibility to the Arctic and its
natural resources, particularly minerals necessary for the green
transition,]{.underline} which, in turn, increases the interest from
(Arctic and non-Arctic) states and extractive industries in the region.
Amidst these unfolding challenges in the Arctic, [[Indigenous peoples
are at the receiving end of not only climate change impacts, but also of
(sustainable) development projects increasingly framed as part of the
green transition, which, instead, can put at further risk already
vulnerable Arctic ecosystems and Indigenous
lifestyles.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[[Unabated]{.mark}]{.underline} (sustainable) [[development projects
exacerbate conflicts over use of land in the Arctic and further threaten
the rights of Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, [which are correlated with
their ancestrally cultivated relationship with their
lands]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as their right to health, livelihoods,
subsistence and culture, among other rights. A holistic worldview with a
strong ecological dimension and relationship with nature is commonly
present in Indigenous knowledge systems and cosmology[. Indigenous
peoples' worldviews, traditionally absent in international law, can thus
aptly inform the development of a more integrated understanding of the
relationship human-- nature in IEL.]{.underline}

As [governments plan]{.underline} their [transitions to renewable
energy]{.underline}, [Indigenous peoples must be deeply
involved]{.underline}. In the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[tribes]{.underline}, who like many marginalized communities often bear
disproportionate public health and socioeconomic burdens from climate
change and legacy pollution, [now have]{.underline} the
[opportunity]{.underline} [to redress historical injustices while
helping meet national sustainable energy needs.]{.underline} [Tribal
lands containan estimated 6.5% of utility-scale technical potential for
US renewable energy development on 5.8% of land area]{.underline} (*1*).
[New federal legislation sets aside approximately \$14 billion solely
for 574 federally recognized American Indian tribes and Alaska Native
villages]{.underline} (*2*--*5*), [which can support tribal climate
responsiveness and energy sovereignty.]{.underline} This [opportunity
positions tribes and villages to develop their economies and reimagine
energy projects on their terms]{.underline}, building beyond many
decades of energy and economic poverty. To respond effectively to this
opportunity, time frames must be aligned, access to information
enhanced, and capacity built.

For example, [many Tribal leaders are limited in their capacity to
manage a bureaucratic landscape of tools that are required for
successful funding applications.]{.underline} This includes, for
instance, the often-cited SAMS.gov website that is required for federal
funding and procurement. As a result of these complicated systems, some
small villages are only able to succeed in applying for federal
assistance by hiring outside consultants who can navigate the labyrinth
of bureaucracy involved in federal funding. For a glimpse of the
challenge, navigate to www.grants.gov to see the web portal through
which most federal grant applications are submitted. Despite the evident
best intentions, the portal is a complex maze of information best suited
to specialists. The creation of several different "technical assistance
centers" or "adaptation centers" has helped some communities overcome
these hurdles, but the reliance upon outside experts may still impinge
upon communities' capacity to exercise self-determination by
articulating their needs in nontechnical language.

**\*Tables 1 and 2 omitted**

Individually, several of these challenges have also been identified by
other researchers. But brought together, this [pattern of seemingly
**mundane obstacles** may **collectively disenfranchise** many Alaska
Native villages.]{.underline} [Micropolitics function by rewarding those
communities that are best able to succeed within **externally imposed
colonial structures**.]{.underline} [As a result, Alaska Native
communities are subjected to a particular form of **neoliberal** and
**colonial governmentality**]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014), [whereby
their consideration for funding is made contingent upon adopting an
externally-imposed political subjectivity]{.underline}---for example, as
clients of engineering firms and grant-writing specialists who are
fluent in the institutional language of metric tons and dollars. [To
receive aid, Alaska Native communities are pressured to adopt the
bureaucratic language and governmental forms of their
colonizers.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} form of governmentality [echoes]{.underline} what
Agrawal terms "**[the soft hammer of self-regulation]{.underline}**"
(Agrawal 2005; p. 15). [When micropolitics are
unacknowledged,]{.underline} Alaska Native communities and [Tribes are
framed as responsible for a lack of]{.underline} competitive
[funding]{.underline} applications, [absolving federal
agencies]{.underline} of the need to actively render assistance. When
grantmaking is too onerous, or calls and emails to federal agencies are
not returned (or are only returned once, perhaps when the local cell
towers are down), [the blame is readily shifted onto
already-disenfranchised communities.]{.underline}

As Alaska Native communities struggle to overcome these micropolitical
barriers, ["capacity building" has emerged as a solution]{.underline}
that positions Native communities as a broken element in an
otherwise-functioning institutional meshwork. [But this narrative risks
**overlooking** the **consequences** of **historical violence** and
**oppression**, and may imply that communities are responsible for their
own success or failure as they apply to---rather than
demand---assistance]{.underline} (Kashwan and Ribot 2021; Marino and
Ribot 2012).

These issues impinge upon communities' ability to make demands upon
systems of power and to access resources; this is where the politics
(relating to power) of micropolitics come into play. [Micropolitics
privileges certain communities and disenfranchises others in a way that
has limited correspondence to need or merit.]{.underline}

[In rural Alaska Native villages, community requests (and demands) for
assistance are only admitted through a highly technical language and
practice of bureaucracy that obfuscate the moral and legal
responsibility the federal government has to assist Tribal
communities]{.underline}. In this process, [Tribes and their members are
required to discipline themselves and become better colonial subjects in
order to be considered for aid]{.underline}.

[Tribes need an overarching technical assistance program to streamline
access to resources.]{.underline} The [US Environmental Protection
Agency's selection of Environmental Justice Thriving Communities
Technical Assistance Centers, in partnership with the DOE, is a step in
the right direction.]{.underline} In addition, [a directory of federal
agencies and nonfederal entities that offer technical assistance is
needed, as are long-term funding streams to support tribal energy
champions]{.underline}. Further[, technical assistance targeted to
tribal energy projects should parallel support for broader climate
mitigation and adaptation.]{.underline}

A [targeted collection of resources and tools for tribes and tribal
partners will help improve access, translation, and education on climate
investments.]{.underline} The Access to Capital Clearinghouse created by
the White House Council on Native American Affairs and the US Department
of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs is now operational, providing
a searchable database of federal funding opportunities available to
tribes (*14*). More broadly, [tribes will benefit from a consolidated
database of funding opportunity announcements from the full spectrum of
federal, state, and philanthropic agencies, including funding levels,
requirements, and deadlines. This database could be developed and
maintained by the federal government or another entity.]{.underline}

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

[A **deep-rooted** **colonial mentality** that remains **pervasive** is
the assumed **supremacy** of a **Western knowledge
system**]{.underline}. [This creates a **paternalistic relationship**
wherein decisions are made by external 'experts' and imposed upon the
Indigenous population.]{.underline} In short, [Indigenous ways of
knowing are undermined.]{.underline}32) The term [Indigenous knowledge
is defined as "the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by
societies with long histories of interaction with their natural
surroundings".]{.underline}33) [[Efforts to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic must not only embrace these different
worldviews, perspectives, and knowledge systems, but **put them
first**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[There is]{.underline} also [[a tendency to assume that the only route
to]{.underline} achieving [greater material benefits]{.underline} or
power [is to adopt a capitalist
econom]{.underline}]{.mark}[y]{.underline}. What Aníbal Quijano---one of
the preeminent thinkers of decolonization theory---terms ['**[cultural
Europeanisation]{.underline}**]{.mark},' but can be understood as
colonial Western society more broadly, [[is taken as universal and
synonymous with being '**developed'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}34) Before
ANCSA was passed in 1971, Alaska Native populations had primarily
engaged in subsistence activities. Since the settlement of land claims
agreements, Alaska Native populations are increasingly entrenched in the
capitalist economy, especially via resource development. Today, most
Indigenous people in Alaska engage in a mixed economy, meaning a
combination of both subsistence and market-based activities.35[) [A
desire to obtain the benefits from natural resource extraction on
Indigenous lands is a primary reason for this growth in capitalist
engagement]{.underline}.36) [Through a decolonization lens, it is
understood that following the rhetoric and logic of Western society is a
way to "reach the same material benefits and the same power as the
Europeans: viz, to conquer nature in short for
'development'".]{.underline}37) [This model of
**development**]{.underline}, however, [has proven "**environmentally
calamitous on the global scale**",]{.underline}38) [made even more dire
by the rapid impact of climate change throughout the
Arctic]{.underline}.]{.mark}

3.3 Discussion: improving domestic diplomacy

[Public institutions do not interact as sovereign bodies in a
frictionless medium.]{.underline} [There are forces at play that operate
at more mundane levels than policy itself.]{.underline} [**Governments**
are **not** things that can be **separated** from the complex world of
**human relationships**]{.underline}; they are made up of people,
computers, intermittent phone connections, hearing aids, and a whole
host of human and more-than-human components (Abrams 1988). The actual
practice of [how governments]{.underline}---federal, Tribal, state, and
regional---[communicate with each other is "messy"]{.underline} (Law
2004). And [**messiness is not apolitical**; it entrenches existing
power structures]{.underline}. [The neglect of
micropolitics]{.underline}, which is one form of this messiness, [leads
to **chronically poor relationships** and **ineffective communication**
between Alaska Native communities and their governments.]{.underline}

[Unaddressed, micropolitics may **prevent** Indigenous communities from
engaging on **equal footing** with the systems designed to serve them.
This **disparages** their **sovereignty**.]{.underline} [These
relationships]{.underline}, in order to succeed, [must be built on a
foundation of mutual trust and understanding]{.underline}. Potawatomi
scholar Kyle Whyte notes that "lessons from generations of colonialism
about how to avert bad relationship-making have not been learned by the
parties who should have learned them" (2020; p. 5). These [institutional
failures are not the responsibility of Tribes to address]{.underline}
(e.g., through "capacity building" as a self-contained remedy); [framing
them as such inappropriately accepts a logic that makes colonized

[To adapt to the warming climate, Indigenous people in Alaska are
relying on their deep understanding and respect for the land, a kind of
humility developed over countless generations.]{.underline} "You can't
really change the Arctic," Frankson said. "You can only change with the
Arctic."

Yes, daily life in Alaska --- with its northern lights, its dependence
on ice and the movement of caribou --- may feel unrelatable. But [this
way of living in tune with the environment and gracefully adapting to a

[Climate change]{.underline} is the one of the biggest challenges facing
the world today (Rodríguez and Alsop 2016) causing sudden and drastic
changes (Arshad et al. 2018) impacting all societies (Heininen 2022),
and [threatening the]{.underline} [survival of humanity]{.underline}
(Arshad et al. 2018). [The impacts of climate change are more severe and
intense in poor and marginalised communities]{.underline} (Ara Parvin
and Reazul Ahsan 2013) [and many Indigenous communities are one of the
most vulnerable]{.underline} (Leal Filho et al. 2021[). Adapting to the
multidimensional changes brought forth by climate change, Indigenous
communities rely heavily on their Indigenous Knowledge (IK) systems to
enhance adapta- tion and resilience to climate change]{.underline}
(Apraku et al. 2018). IK refers to the repository of knowledge,
practices, beliefs, and insights developed over generations within
Indigenous communities (Sukula 2006). [IK is deeply rooted in the
cultural, social, and ecological contexts of specific Indigenous
groups]{.underline} and is closely tied to their relationship with the
land, the environment, and tradi- tional ways of life (Kusumastuti et
al. 2023; Radcliffe et al. 2020). [The use of IK, alongside scientific
knowledge provides an efficient solution to enhance climate change
adaptation and build the resilience of the Indigenous
communities]{.underline} in the face of a changing climate (Chen and
Cheng 2020), which has also increased the severity and frequency of
disasters (Heininen 2022).

[Investment in agriculture will directly help in capitalising on IK as
agriculture is the main occupation in many Indigenous
communities]{.underline} (Zvobgo et al. 2023; Nkomwa et al. 2014).
[Finding effective and sustainable solutions in the agriculture sector
will enhance adaptive capacity and resilienc]{.underline}e (Sakapaji
2021; Rai et al. 2022; Negi et al. 2017). New [agricultural technologies
can be more appropriately designed for diverse contexts when IK is
bridged]{.underline} into research and policy (Filho et al. 2022). [Many
farmers are already combining Indigenous and modern knowledge systems to
mitigate climate change ris]{.underline}ks[. Promoting this bridging
would avoid maladaptation and enhance livelihoods]{.underline} (Guodaar
et al. 2021). [For agriculture-reliant Indigenous communities, measures
towards enhancing resilience by improving productivity, reducing hunger,
and safeguarding the environment is key to their survival]{.underline}
(Mensah et al. 2020). Therefore, the agriculture sector should be fully
funded to address climate variabilities, particularly at the local
level, where people rely mostly on IK to adapt to climate change
(Sakapaji 2022; Makondo and Thomas 2018). Investments to support farmers
to take up integrated farming (Landicho et al. 2016) with enhanced
access to capital to purchase improved seed varieties, buy
agrochemicals, irrigate, and implement soil conservation techniques have
become necessary (Kaganzi et al. 2021).

[Empowering governance institutions at the local level is necessary to
benefit from IK. Governance capacity at all levels need to be
empowered]{.underline} (Sakapaji 2022; Hosen et al. 2020) by investing
in human resources[, providing access to finance,]{.underline} and
improving knowledge management systems (Maliao et al. 2022; Filho et al.
2023) to build adaptation and climate resilience (Sakapaji 2022).
Studies in Africa have highlighted the crucial role of local
institutions in supporting local adaptation strategies by providing
weather forecasts, facilitating information exchange, and managing
resource (Legide et al. 2024). [Local institutions, grounded in IK, must
be integrated with state-level institutions in policy development and
implementation to reduce community vulnerability]{.underline} (Ingty
2017) with networks for sound coordination between all stakeholders
(Sakapaji 2022; Son et al. 2020; Negi et al. 2017). [It is essential for
local and national governments to prioritise the development of
infrastructure in marginalised communities that depend on natural
resources for their survival for climate change adaptation and
resilience]{.underline} (Rai et al. 2022). Therefore, [policy barriers
need to be addressed and capacities of local insti- tutions should be
developed to allow bridging of IK into climate change adaptation and
disaster risk management policies (Sakapaji 2022).]{.underline}

Awareness creation through improved access to infor- mation,
environmental education, experience sharing among community members,
social bonding, and institu- tional support is crucial for enhancing the
use of IK in effective climate change adaptation (Amare 2018; Begg et
al. 2023; Rai et al. 2022[). Collaboration among key
stakeholders---including government agencies, non- government
organisations, businesses, and Indigenous people should be
strengthened]{.underline} (Begg et al. 2023). Effective communication of
climate change issues and knowledge will alert Indigenous people about
the impacts of climate change and [help identify innovative]{.underline}
[adaptation strategies]{.underline} (Landicho et al. 2016). Datta and
Kairy (2024) found that the prevailing mismanagement and ignorance
towards Indigenous communities needs to be addressed. As such,
disseminating knowledge and [helping Indigenous communities to adopt
appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures have become
necessary]{.underline} (Rai et al. 2022). Promoting IK among young
people and infusing it in formal education systems will be essential
(Landicho et al. 2016) for enhancing its applicability and
sustainability.

Intergenerational transmission of IK to younger knowl- edge holders has
become critical for its conservation and promotion given its
significance in climate change adapta- tion and resilience (Granderson
2017; Tugjamba et al. 2021; Hiwasaki et al. 2015). This warrants IK to
be properly documented, archived and researched (Granderson 2017;
Hiwasaki et al. 2015; Huntington et al. 2017). Filho et al. (2023)
describes the preservation and transmission of IK as one of its biggest
challenges. Engaging older knowledge custodians, women, and other
vulnerable groups in sharing their expertise with youth is crucial for
transferring IK to the younger generation (Granderson 2017; Tugjamba et
al. 2021). There is often no mechanism for passing down such knowledge,
and young Indigenous people commonly rely on radio or TV for hazard
predictions, which lack local specificity (Hiwasaki et al. 2015). It is
crucial to preserve this knowledge so the younger generation can use it
to strengthen climate change adaptation and build community resilience
(Hiwasaki et al. 2015).

#### Local community adaptation key to solving -- and evolves over time to ensure responsive to changes in the local environment

The second significant finding of this study is the crucial role of
local knowledge in shaping effective community adaptation strategies to
climate change. This research underscores that [local knowledge,
encompassing traditional practices, indigenous wisdom, and community
experiences, is integral to the development of context-specific and
sustainable adaptation measures. Communities with a deep understanding
of their local environment have been found to develop more resilient and
appropriate strategies that are closely aligned with the ecological and
cultural context of the area. These strategies often include traditional
agricultural practices, such as seasonal and weather pattern
observations, which have been passed down through generations and are
crucial for predicting and responding to climate
variability.]{.underline} The study also reveals that [local knowledge
contributes to the effective management of natural resources, such as
water and forests, which are vital for community resilience in the face
of climate change. In many communities, especially in remote and rural
areas, indigenous knowledge systems provide a framework for
understanding environmental changes and devising practical
solutions.]{.underline}

The findings highlight that [local knowledge is not static but evolves
over time, integrating new experiences and insights, which is essential
in adapting to the dynamic nature of climate change. This adaptive
capacity of local knowledge is particularly evident in communities that
have faced and overcome environmental challenges in the
past.]{.underline} The study also notes the importance of preserving and
transmitting this knowledge to future generations, as it forms the
foundation of community resilience. Furthermore, the [research indicates
that the integration of local knowledge with scientific research can
lead to more comprehensive and effective adaptation
strategies]{.underline}. However, it is observed that local knowledge is
often undervalued in formal climate change policies and initiatives,
which can lead to the implementation of less effective, top-down
adaptation measures. The study advocates for a greater recognition and
integration of local knowledge in climate change adaptation planning and
policy-making. In summary, [local knowledge is a critical asset for
communities in adapting to climate change, offering valuable insights
and practices that are tailored to local environmental and social
conditions.]{.underline}

### Adaptation solve climate change 

#### Adaptation key -- solves multiple harms of climate change

Scientific studies show that the [Earth is now about 1.1°C warmer than
it was in the 1800s. This warming is causing widespread and rapid
changes in our planet's atmosphere, ocean and ecosystems. As a result,
weather and climate extremes are becoming more frequent in every region
of the world.]{.underline}

According to climate models, [without significant climate action, the
world is headed for 2.5 to 2.9°C temperature rise above pre-industrial
levels this century, which is well above the safety limits established
by scientists]{.underline}.

With every fraction of a degree of warming, [the impacts of climate
change will become more frequent and more intense -- and adaptation will
become that much harder and more expensive for people and
ecosystems.]{.underline}

[The urgency is especially great for developing countries, which are
already feeling the impacts of climate change and are particularly
vulnerable due to a combination of factors, including their geographical
and climatic conditions, their high dependence on natural resources, and
their limited capacity to adapt to a changing climate. Adaptation is
also particularly important for women and young children, older
populations, ethnic minorities, Indigenous Peoples, refugees and
displaced persons, who are shown to be disproportionately affected by
climate change.]{.underline}

Even in very positive scenarios in which [we manage to significantly and
swiftly cut greenhouse gas emissions, climate change will continue to
impact our world for decades to come because of the energy already
trapped in the system. This means cutting down emissions is only one
part of our response to the climate crisis: adaptation is needed to
limit the impacts and safeguard people and nature.]{.underline}

#### 1ac - Arctic indigenous people on the frontlines of climate impacts and key to green transitions

[The Arctic]{.underline} region [showcases the most severe environmental
consequences of global actions and decisions taken elsewhere, but it
could also play a leading role for a radical turn in the anthropocentric
trajectories that led it to its current state of
vulnerability,]{.underline} including in the multilevel legal and policy
frameworks that enabled it. As [Tennberg notes, "\[political\] and
economic development of the Arctic is increasingly intertwined with
politics beyond the region, and its governance is
decentralized]{.underline}, taking place locally, nationally, regionally
and globally."

[In manifesting the decentralised character of Arctic governance, the
green transition presents the Arctic as a key and attractive partner for
its implementation.]{.underline} However, [the rapidly changing Arctic
environment facing snow cover decrease, thawing permafrost and rapidly
melting sea ice, increases the accessibility to the Arctic and its
natural resources, particularly minerals necessary for the green
transition,]{.underline} which, in turn, increases the interest from
(Arctic and non-Arctic) states and extractive industries in the region.
Amidst these unfolding challenges in the Arctic, [Indigenous peoples are
at the receiving end of not only climate change impacts, but also of
(sustainable) development projects increasingly framed as part of the
green transition, which, instead, can put at further risk already
vulnerable Arctic ecosystems and Indigenous lifestyles. ]{.underline}

[Unabated]{.underline} (sustainable) [development projects exacerbate
conflicts over use of land in the Arctic and further threaten the rights
of Indigenous peoples, which are correlated with their ancestrally
cultivated relationship with their lands]{.underline}, such as their
right to health, livelihoods, subsistence and culture, among other
rights. A holistic worldview with a strong ecological dimension and
relationship with nature is commonly present in Indigenous knowledge
systems and cosmology[. Indigenous peoples' worldviews, traditionally
absent in international law, can thus aptly inform the development of a
more integrated understanding of the relationship human-- nature in
IEL.]{.underline}

[Tribes need an overarching technical assistance program to streamline
access to resources.]{.underline} The [US Environmental Protection
Agency's selection of Environmental Justice Thriving Communities
Technical Assistance Centers, in partnership with the DOE, is a step in
the right direction.]{.underline} In addition, [a directory of federal
agencies and nonfederal entities that offer technical assistance is
needed, as are long-term funding streams to support tribal energy
champions]{.underline}. Further[, technical assistance targeted to
tribal energy projects should parallel support for broader climate
mitigation and adaptation.]{.underline}

A [targeted collection of resources and tools for tribes and tribal
partners will help improve access, translation, and education on climate
investments.]{.underline} The Access to Capital Clearinghouse created by
the White House Council on Native American Affairs and the US Department
of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs is now operational, providing
a searchable database of federal funding opportunities available to
tribes (*14*). More broadly, [tribes will benefit from a consolidated
database of funding opportunity announcements from the full spectrum of
federal, state, and philanthropic agencies, including funding levels,
requirements, and deadlines. This database could be developed and
maintained by the federal government or another entity.]{.underline}

[Capacity development entails not only funding projects but also funding
people, especially tribal energy champions, whose boots on the ground
are essential for addressing inequities in energy
distribution]{.underline}. These energy champions are familiar faces for
tribal communities, and they understand tribal realities, cultural
sensitivities, and sustainability goals based on tribal choices that are
made on tribal terms. [Tribal energy champions can be based in
for-profit, nonprofit, or tribal enterprises.]{.underline}

Both [short and long-term funding opportunities]{.underline} are
[critically important for tribal workforce and capacity. Tribes need
programs that build internal tribal capacity through training and
professional development, including the opportunity to make adjustments
based on lessons learned from research.]{.underline} Such [programs can
provide immediate local benefits, support future work in the energy
sector, and spur economic development for long-term regenerative wealth,
including tribally owned technology and manufacturing to increase
residential solar sources for communities off-grid]{.underline} (*15*).

[Long-term tribal workforce development requires support for academic
programs and partnerships with educational institutions to train
energy-sector professionals.]{.underline} For example, Sandia National
Laboratories' Tribal Energy Program provides summer and year-round
interns with real-world experience and career development. Nondegree
programs, such as executive education for tribal, nonprofit, and federal
leaders, can also contribute. Supporting and training current staff are
essential because talent pools grow slowly through degree programs.
[Academic institutions, in particular tribal colleges, should be
supported to foster tribal energy and environmental programs, including
new research on the social, cultural, environmental, and economic
aspects of guiding the energy transition on tribal lands.]{.underline}

[We sketch a roadmap for designing, implementing, and funding projects
and people to accelerate the renewable energy transition while also
benefiting all tribal entities.]{.underline} [Implementation will
require vigilance to ensure that integrating justice throughout agency
programs generates tribal wealth without recreating historical
injustices.]{.underline} The issues we highlight and the recommendations
we make are not all surprising, but they require bold action.

[Many communities require assistance navigating the grant application or
other funding processes]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} of these
approaches [require detailed knowledge of multiple funding agency
requirements and constraints, which can be challenging for a small
community that might seek this assistance only once every decade or
two.]{.underline} The Denali Commission was frequently mentioned by both
providers and receivers of technical assistance as key in assisting
communities in navigating processes to apply for federal funding.
Similarly, funding agencies such as AEA and USDA dedicate resources to
assist communities in developing successful grant proposals. [Some of
these proposals require knowledge of and collaboration with multiple
funding sources. Capacity building is needed on a broad array of
skills,]{.underline} from maintenance on power generating equipment,
HVAC systems in public buildings and water/wastewater infrastructure to
administrative, clerical and governance experience at utilities, school
districts and village governments. One facilitator of technical
assistance described their process as follows: "The first layer of
capacity building technical assistance goes to the individual making
sure they\'ve got the skill sets that they need for the project at hand.
Then we ratchet that up to technical assistance and capacity building at
the organizational level. We will take that capacity building and
technical assistance up one more notch at a community level. When I go
into a small village community, we go in there not just for the project
proponents and we put them into the context of Community where we\'ll
invite the municipality, the tribe, the utility, the corporation, the
school board, because we have to have Community-based solutions or we
don\'t have a solution at all."

Conclusions

[Arctic stakeholders]{.underline} [are a set of various]{.underline}
interest [groups]{.underline}, organizations, associations, NGOs,
industries and businesses, policymakers, gov- ernmental and
non-governmental organizations, residents of the region [and the rights
holders, Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}. [These groups are **not
homogenous** but have different interests]{.underline}, needs,
[agendas]{.underline}, [knowledges]{.underline}, [and ways on how they
would like to be engaged]{.underline}. This is very similar to any other
region in the world; however, [what is important in the Arctic is that
it is a homeland for its **Indigenous Peoples**, rights holders, whose
cultures and lives are **threatened** by **climate change** at a speed
that is faster than anywhere else in the world]{.underline}.

[The Arctic has become a hot spot]{.underline} [with growing pressures
for nat- ural resource extraction and green energy
transition]{.underline}. On the other hand, there is growing interest in
research [projects and]{.underline} scientific [actions to
understand]{.underline} the processes behind [climate change
and]{.underline} to [find solutions]{.underline}, and ways [to adapt and
mitigate to be able to battle against climate change]{.underline}. All
these [endeavours **require** an **open** and **respectful dialogue**
**and co-design** of the **research agendas** with rights holders and
stakeholders]{.underline}.

Regions are different, and practices and processes in all aspects are
different. Thus there is no common process that would apply throughout
the Arctic. Therefore, [there are no common guidelines, "one shop that
fits all"---process, in community engagement, stakeholder and rights
holder dialogue.]{.underline} [Engagement of mul- tiple stakeholders in
the same project needs **good governance** as power differences and
different knowledges possessed by different stakeholders, involvement,
and interests influence the decision adopted and the decision-making
process]{.underline}33.

It is time to acknowledge that [**Indigenous Peoples**, rights holders,
should be **equal partners** in **deciding** on what happens to their
lands and waters, both in **economic development** and **research
projects**.]{.underline} [The Arctic is neither a nature reserve, nor
only an ice-covered land- scape]{.underline}; [it is a **homeland** of
**diverse societies** that live both in well- connected large cities and
remote villages]{.underline}. It is not homogenous, [its stakeholders
and rights holders are not homogenous, and there- fore **open
processes** and **dialogues** are **needed** to **empower** them in
future projects that can offer them an opportunity for **co-designing**,
**contributing** and **collaborating**]{.underline}.

[There is a need to raise awareness on how to plan new processes for
both research activities and economic development with stakeholders and
rights holders.]{.underline} To foster stakeholder engage- ment and
rights holder dialogue a new open online "Stakeholder Engagement Portal"
is being developed and launched in 2024 by EU-PolarNet project. It will
provide e.g. guidance, and links to best practices on how to work with
various stakeholders and rights holders and how to sustain the ongoing
dialogue. [Working with stakeholders and rights holders is an ongoing
process and life- long learning, that builds trust and competence, and
uses all pos- sible knowledges available for the best
outcome.]{.underline} [The successful stakeholders\' and rights holders'
engagement results in research findings that will help to **mitigate**
**climate change** effects or to build new **economic developments**
beneficial for the Arctic and its people in sustaining the Arctic as
their homeland]{.underline}.

### AT consultations exist now

[In the context of the global rush to decarbonise, participatory
processes of community consultation and consent received heightened
importance and urgency. Meaningful consultation and consent are crucial
to balancing power relations between governments, industry and affected
communities. Despite an unprecedented recognition of Indigenous peoples'
rights and their role in just energy transitions, complex challenges
continue to characterise consultation and consent driven by states and
companies.]{.underline} Based on an integrative narrative and case
review of over 100 academic articles, we have identified [limitations of

for consultation; unclear legal frameworks and gaps; weak relationships
and distrust between Indigenous communities, state and industry;
cultural disconnect; and asymmetries in power, knowledge, and
decision-making authority.]{.underline} They clearly speak to key
components of just energy transitions for Indigenous peoples, as
conceptualised by Rioux-Gobeil and Thomassin to include justice for
Indigenous knowledge renewal and procedural power.

[Many of these limitations are structural, rooted in colonial legacies,
top-down and centralised decision-making, and neoliberal economic
systems. These limitations are also relational, stemming from
insufficient efforts, resourcing, and lack of trust-building
relationships. As cases from the circumpolar north illustrate, each
community experience is unique, given the local complexities of
histories, cultural practices, political contexts, and resources that
Indigenous peoples have at their disposal to engage
meaningfully]{.underline}. Only a few cases documented positive
community experiences of consultation and consent, reflecting common
bias in academic literature to focus on problematic cases. While many of
the reviewed studies focus on the lack of Indigenous capacity and
ability to engage, other studies discuss activism and resistance to
colonial and extractive structures that increasingly impact on resource
decision making.

#### \*Although some focus on collaboration exists, it characterizes indigenous groups as stake holders not rights holder -- this current approach to development projects contributes to marginalization

By its part, in natural resource management three characteristics in
stakeholder approaches have been identified: 1. All-inclusivity, 2.
Prioritization of economic interests, 3) A historical view on rights,
what risks continued marginalization of Indigenous Peoples and
traditional livelihood despite the intention to nurture Indigenous and
local participation by acknowledging them as stakeholders. Sarkki,
Heikkinen and Löf28 concluded that [[**defining** Indigenous Peoples as
**stakeholders** keeps them **marginalized** in decision- making
processes and thus, they seldom can influence decisions on economic
development projects]{.mark} planned at their traditional lands and
waters]{.underline}. [[**Recognizing** Indigenous Peoples as **rights
holders** can help to **empower** Indigenous
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It can also assist in highlighting
possible gaps and shortcomings in land use govern- ance.]{.underline}
[The definition of rights holders is tied to **social
equity**]{.underline}, [and [it includes their central role in
procedures related to defining what the key issues in the distribution
of benefits and burdens resulting from planned economic developments
are]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is important when avoiding dominance of
stakeholders and shareholders with eco- nomic interests over the
Indigenous rights to use their traditional lands and
waters]{.underline}.

[Planning and decision making in economic development]{.underline} and
building plans [that affect Indigenous cultures and living conditions
often creates conflicts that can last for long time.]{.underline}
[Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' rights is **key** in these
conflicts]{.underline}. In addition to this, [an **open**, **two-way
dialogue**, with **respect** to each other and a **genuine interest** in
solving the conflict is needed]{.underline}. [The **empowering** of all
participants]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the
[participation]{.underline} [and ensuring]{.underline} that
[participants have power to influence decisions]{.underline} [is
**vital** as **power inequities**]{.underline} between participants,
stakeholders, and rights holders, [is a **barrier** to meaningful
engagement29]{.underline}. [Through **participation** a **viable
solution** can be achieved, especially if power is delegated to
participants, showing them a value of participation]{.underline}30.

[**Stakeholders' fatigue** is often used term as an outcome of fre-
quent requests from researchers, and invitations to consultations and
hearings needed for planning economic development.]{.underline} It can
happen that the same community member is invited to hearings and
workshops on almost a weekly basis. [One of the
recommendations]{.underline} listed in the White paper on the status of
stakeholder engagement in Polar research31 [is to use **intermediaries**
to act as contact points when **trust** needs to be built and
**dialogue** opened.]{.underline} [This can also avoid fatigue and
ensure that processes follow ethical guidelines.]{.underline} Working
via intermediaries would leave the decision on who to contact and how to
best engage with the project to their repre- sentative: That is, to a
person, who could also work as a liaison between the community and the
project leader and who would be an important person for building the
trust. In addition to this, [working via intermediaries is extremely
useful for, environmental impact assessments and economic development
projects because as an organized civil society, intermediaries, can
contribute more meaningfully than a single person to environmental
protection and projects by creative problem-solving and long-term
commitment32]{.underline}.

[A lack of or insufficient consultation and consent has been attributed
to legal disputes and project cancelations.]{.underline} In conflict
situations of complex, prolonged, epistemic and value-based
disagreements, the opportunity to object and seek remedies is important,
however Indigenous people question whether these are sufficient to
enable equitable decision-making. In northern Fennoscandia and northern
Canada, Indigenous peoples are taking to court energy and mining
companies and governments for violation of their rights, including the
right to FPIC, with mixed outcomes \[33,84,141\]. [However, even in the
case of legal victories, there are no clear implications for future
projects questioning the fairness of the ongoing
transitions]{.underline} \[84\]. Some argue that [conflicts can
represent an opportunity for re-framing conventional approaches in
democratic societies, generating novel spaces for systemic change
towards sustainability and equity]{.underline} \[38,117[\]. [Achieving
justice in energy transitions requires not only changes in technology or
regulations.]{.underline} [Enabling just energy transitions necessitates
a redefinition of governance and norms that enable deep structural and
relational changes so that Indigenous and land-connected people control
development on their lands on their own terms]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[57[\]. [Across circumpolar
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} advances in jurisprudence
and Indigenous peoples' assertion of their rights have influenced
governments, companies, right-holders and stakeholders to start
[[re-envisioning, reviewing, and redesigning norms and approaches to
consultation and consen]{.underline}t]{.mark}. The scope of these
initiatives is broader than the narrow legal definitions of the "duty to
consult" \[89\], which "appears to mostly enable, rather than impede,
the expansion of colonial and capitalist social relations" \[84\].
Increasingly, communities are negotiating access to the lands they own,
manage and use, generating some level of control. Cases in Canada
demonstrate Indigenous-led and Indigenous-centred decision-making that
leverages the UNDRIP and treaties to define and control the
decision-making processes, including through Indigenous-led impact
assessments and Indigenous-co-ownership arrangements. However, as cases
have demonstrated, the Sami ´ across the Sapmi ´ have less leverage to
influence decision-making.

In the paper, we provided a nuanced understanding of transitions in
governance across the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions \[142\], focussing
on Indigenous-centred decision-making[. [We differentiated Indigenous
benefiting and Indigenous-informed from Indigenous-led approaches, with
the key difference being in the level of leadership and agency of
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. [Indigenous-led approaches recognise
that Indigenous land-connected communities are not just stakeholders,
they are rightsholders as well as leaders and
managers.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indigenous nations should be considered
as self-determining entities, without imposing unilateral processes
\[86\]. This is the key principle of Indigenous-led FPIC, as per recent
guidelines developed by the Securing Indigenous Peoples' Rights in the
Green Economy (SIRGE) Coalition \[143\].

While governments and companies are seeking to strengthen and multiply
participatory channels for meaningful community engagement in
decision-making[, [new initiatives in governance and management with
direct participation of Indigenous peoples point to promising avenues
for justice and equity in transition processes]{.underline},]{.mark}
however, challenges remain. In the paper, we identified barriers to
Indigenous-centred decision-making including lack of recognition and
integration of Indigenous peoples' rights, Indigenous representation and
internal decisionmaking, and formal legal and regulatory constraints.
Furthermore, critical literature on Indigenous rights and consultation
and consent cautions to be aware of different power effects these
initiatives might entail beyond their stated aims \[144\], as several
studies argue that norms with an "emancipatory and reconciliation
potential" can ultimately lead to disempowering processes when their
meaning is curtailed \[145\]. This is because Indigenous-informed,
Indigenous-benefiting and many Indigenous-led approaches, whilst aiming
to ensure Indigenous peoples are active participants in decision-making,
are based on formal and patronized decision-making processes which are
institutionalised within top-down legal, regulatory, and corporate
systems.

While advances have been reported in the circumpolar context, more needs
to be done for re-centring Indigenous-led decision-making for just
energy transitions. Some of the key lessons learnt from our review are:

1\. [Prioritizing trust and relationships]{.underline}. Meaningful
decision-making moves at "the speed of trust" and communication and
transparency are critical to developing and sustaining collaborations
and partnerships.

2\. [Indigenous-centred and led approaches are based on not only
capacity and leadership of Indigenous people, but more so on the
capacity of institutions and organisations]{.underline}. [Building
institutional capacities m]{.underline}ust be driven by clearly defined
visions, values and practices and [align with Indigenous-centred
priorities and approaches.]{.underline}

3\. It is important to establish a shared understanding of definitions
and meanings of terms such as 'consent', 'dialogue', and
'benefitsharing', as they can vary significantly and can be loaded with
negative meanings. The concept 'Indigenous-led' can be exploited to get
access to land and resources.

4[. [Enabling Indigenous-centred decision-making requires access to
resources and support including capital, technical and legal expertise,
infrastructure and time. Sufficient resourcing is needed to meaningfully
engage and negotiate as well as fulfill cultural responsibilities and
rights.]{.underline}]{.mark}

5\. To be of value to Indigenous people, consultation and consent should
incorporate the recognition of a 'no' as a valuable outcome of
consultation. Furthermore, conditions for consent are not static and are
subject to renegotiation, in particular, in the context of the shifting
(re-)assertion of Indigenous rights and self-determination, emphasizing
the need for ongoing dialogue.

6\. Finally, just transition hinges upon the recognition of Indigenous
rights, self-determination and economic reconciliation. Research
highlights the importance of restorative justice and truth-telling about
the profound impacts of colonisation on Indigenous peoples across
generations to enable equitable consultation and consent.

Overall[, [we suggest that securing just energy transition calls for a
shift in the practices of community consultation and consent that embeds
processes and norms that uphold the rights, interests, knowledges, and
values of Indigenous peoples and land-connected
communities]{.underline}.]{.mark} Further research should continue to
document and critically examine community consultation and consent
focusing on practices that genuinely value and embed Indigenous
perspectives. In particular, there is a need for a wider range of
academic analysis that includes both cautionary and positive examples of
community engagement as well as resistance \[65,146\]. Such
contributions are important for advancing research and understanding of
justice in the context of energy transitions that incorporate the rights
and perspectives of Indigenous and landconnected peoples \[22,147\].

#### Green transition requires integration of indigenous perspectives through genuine collaboration

[It is widely accepted that whenever development affects people, they
should be involved in decision-making. Public participation generally
involves formal consultation, where information about a project is
disseminated, and citizens are invited to comment]{.underline} --
although feedback may not always influence decision-making. Formal
consultation is often a requirement for project approval and impact
assessments. [International]{.underline} frameworks, [guidelines, and
academic research stress the importance of meaningful
engagement]{.underline} -- from the outset and throughout the project's
lifecycle. [Meaningful engagement is believed to help to understand
local needs and concerns, promote more equitable benefit distribution,
and reduce disputes and conflicts around industrial projects. Indigenous
peoples have international legal protections requiring FPIC, a
recognised right under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and International Labour Organization's
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169 (ILO C169).]{.underline}

[FPIC gives Indigenous people the right to provide and withhold consent
regarding projects impacting their lands. True consent includes the
right to say "No", and the right for that decision to be
respected.]{.underline} In some countries, Indigenous peoples hold these
rights under national legislation, providing decision-making and
negotiating power, and a right to remedies. [Even without legal
mandates, governments and companies can voluntarily incorporate FPIC
into decision-making processes. Despite commitments to meaningful
consultation and FPIC, there are inherent power relations as
"decision-making is not made by those who are affected by those
decisions". Indigenous peoples continue to assert that their voices are
often ignored, and their demands unmet.]{.underline} The potential of
Indigenous rights is that they provide prerequisites for Indigenous-led
decision-making processes.

In 2013, the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples, [James Anaya, highlighted a "preferred" model of resource
development based on Indigenous control, emphasizing the Indigenous
right to "determine priorities and strategies for the development or use
of their lands and territories"]{.underline}, as per Article 32 of the
UNDRIP. [Recent research on environmental, climate, and energy justice
from the Indigenous perspective emphasises the importance of respecting
and centering Indigenous peoples' rights, interests, knowledges, and
responsibilities in decision-making and relationships with governments
and corporations. Indigenous-centred decision-making is essential for a
just energy transition: the latter can be achieved only when the former
is respected.]{.underline}

[The Arctic is experiencing a **dangerous transformation** because
of]{.underline} the amplifying effects of [climate change]{.underline},
[warming at four times faster than the rest of the world.]{.underline}1)
As the region grapples with ongoing challenges posed by the changing
climate, [there is a growing inclination towards embracing **sustainable
solutions**]{.underline}, notably in energy and resource extraction.
[However, the responses from]{.underline} both the international
community and state [governments]{.underline} [to implement "greener"
energy processes are not without **concerns**]{.underline}, particularly
[regarding the impact new]{.underline} energy [technology can have
on]{.underline} vulnerable communities, including **[Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}**. Recently, [Indigenous groups internationally
have challenged governmental use of land and resources that have
historically been cared for by Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. Many are
protesting the dangerous pollution resulting from resource extraction
and renewable energy developments. As a result, the management of
renewable energy technology (RET) has become a topic of academic debate,
alongside traditional non-renewable sources. Some scholars are now using
the concept of extractivism in the energy sector to explain the
prevailing conflicts between Indigenous communities and authorities,
viewing energy development as an extension of colonialist power. Others,
however, see the expansion of RET in Indigenous communities as a step
forward in their self-governance. This article seeks to explore the
transition from traditional non-renewable energy sources, such as oil
and gas, to renewable energy, such as wind and hydro, and assess the
impact on Indigenous communities in the Arctic regions of Canada and
Norway.

Evolution of the Energy Sector

Generally, there are three ways Indigenous communities have interacted
with the energy sector within the Arctic states of Canada and Norway:
through traditional oil and gas production, through renewable resource
developments, like hydro or wind power, and through the extraction of
minerals and resources needed to develop the energy sector, such as
copper mining. There has been extensive research done in the first area,
as resistance to oil and gas extraction has been well documented for
years, especially within North America.2) Persistence of state
governments in pursuing energy projects that harm or pollute Indigenous
lands exemplifies the perpetuation of colonialism and colonial violence.
While these government actions are not direct forms of physical violence
against human bodies, the indirect forms are still impactful for
Indigenous communities today.3) In 2020, there were protests against the
Coastal GasLink Pipeline in Western Canada, a project planning to cut
through 190 kilometers of the Wetʼsuwetʼen First Nation. Although
environmental and Indigenous consultations took place, Wetʼsuwetʼen
chiefs never gave approval for the land to be used, inciting protests
across the country.

The rhetoric surrounding these protests often criticized Indigenous
perspectives, with the media labeling anti-pipeline activism as an act
of "domestic terrorism."4) The framing of Indigenous resistance to
energy developments as a threat to the country fosters colonial
discourse and may result in more oppressive controls such as
surveillance and excessive policing.5) In the Wetʼsuwetʼen case, police
and military forces were prepared to use 'lethal force' against
protestors and were authorized to employ 'as much violence toward the
gate as you want' to remove a roadblock protestors built to obstruct
access to Wetʼsuwetʼen land.6) Dog raids and assault weapons were used,
resulting in the arrest of 74 protestors. Subsequent reports have
revealed that the treatment of protestors was unlawful and the tactics
employed were 'disproportionate' to the level of threat, as there were
no reports of protestors resorting to violence.7)

[As the climate continues to shift, and renewable energy becomes
increasingly in demand,]{.underline} some argue that [the transition
towards renewable energy may offer a better solution to create a more
sustainable future for Indigenous communities and improve conditions for
exercising sovereignty.]{.underline}8) [However, resistance to RET
developments has also emerged]{.underline}. While it is not as
extensively documented as the Coastal GasLink Pipeline protests, [there
are discernible patterns in the behavior of authorities that indicate
the presence of structural oppression]{.underline}. As recently as 2023,
there have been protests against the development of wind turbines in the
Fosen region of central Norway.9) These wind farms were established by
three Norwegian investors, and from their conception over three years
ago, there were concerns about the development's impact on reindeer
grazing land, that the turbines threaten to disrupt traditional Saami
reindeer herding practices.10) Despite these concerns, the farm was
approved, and the development was completed in 2020.11) These concerns
proved to be valid, as reindeer herders reported that the noise and size
of the wind turbines frightened the reindeer.12) In October 2021, the
Norwegian government declared the development 'unlawful', stating that
it violated the protected cultural rights of the Indigenous Sámi by
encroaching on their reindeer grazing lands.13) However, over two and a
half years later, the wind farm is still operating as the government did
not call to have them removed.14)

[In the same way traditional oil and gas extraction were furthering
structural violence against Indigenous peoples, renewable energy can
create similar challenges.]{.underline} The Saami Parliament called the
building of the wind farm in Fosen an act of 'green colonialism' and it
can be defined as "pinpointing that the processes around wind energy
development might intensify colonial losses of land and rights in
Norway."15) [The extension of colonialism into climate change mitigation
is becoming increasingly apparent]{.underline} through instances such as
the Fosen Wind farm, [as governments prioritize the energy sector over
the concerns of their population]{.underline}.

Additionally, [one of the most overlooked aspects of the continued
colonization of the energy sector is mineral and resource extraction
required for the creation of renewable energy devices]{.underline}, such
as wind turbines. Necessary for solar, wind, tidal, and hydro as a
thermal and electrical conductor, one of the most commonly needed
minerals for the expansion of renewable energy is copper.16) A heavily
mined resource throughout the Arctic, this has become a point of tension
with Indigenous communities in Canada and Norway, as well as other
Arctic states, such as Russia. An example of this can be found in the
mountains of Kvalsund, Norway, where a controversial copper mine was
approved in 2019, an instance in which the Ministry of Trade in Norway
expressed that "the green shift is dependent on increased recovery of
many types of metals that can be used in new technologies...the mineral
industry's raw material for industry is therefore important for
achieving the climate goals."17) Although copper is necessary to achieve
climate goals, Indigenous and environmental groups warn of the cost of
such mines, as waste dumping into water sources and interruption of
reindeer husbandry are significant risks that will worsen the
environment in which Saami peoples live and work, continuing the trend
of injustice towards Indigenous peoples.18)

Opportunities and Challenges for Indigenous Communities

[**Despite** the **risks** associated with renewable energy
developments, on a smaller scale, the adoption of **wind and hydropower
technologies** in Canada's Indigenous communities has proven
**transformative**, offering a **sustainable alternative** to
diesel-powered facilities plagued by contamination
issues.]{.underline}19) In Canada, there are over 170 remote Indigenous
communities that rely primarily on diesel for electricity,20) but aging
facilities are causing "brownouts," leading to numerous issues, such as
water boil advisories and non-functional water treatment facilities. For
instance, in 2022, Iqaluit experienced a two-month boil water advisory
due to an aging diesel fuel tank leaking into the city's water
supply.21)

[There are some instances]{.underline}, especially within Canada, [in
which wind and hydropower have **significantly increased** the
**sustainability** of many Arctic communities,]{.underline} such as the
Pic Mobert First Nation in Ontario. The community owns 50% of the Gitchi
Animki Hydroelectric Project, or the Henvey Inlet First Nation wind
partnership, the largest partnership in Canada which creates jobs and
brings in millions of dollars annually for the community.22)
[**Indigenous led projects** have the potential to create both the
ability to trust in the **longevity** of a power source, and in many
instances, benefit from **socioeconomic assets** if communities decide
to own and operate their systems **independently**]{.underline}.23)
[These processes can give communities more **autonomy** and
"**redistribute**" power and justice away from governments and other
historically oppressive authorities.]{.underline}24)

The [**decolonization** of lands and systems Indigenous groups rely on
is **vital** for the betterment of their communities]{.underline}, [but
the current process of establishing renewable energy developments is not
the most sustainable way forward.]{.underline} The emerging literature
on the concept that RET has the potential to extend colonial systems
into the climate crisis is critical in understanding how to better
decolonize the energy sector. While important in the fight against
climate change, **[the energy sector is not held sufficiently
accountable]{.underline}** with regards to its lack of Indigenous
inclusion. [Even if governments acknowledge the potential risks, there
are often only temporary solutions]{.underline}, such as halting
construction for brief periods of time that are important to reindeer
husbandry, public apologies, or monetary compensation.25) The wind farm
case in Fosen, Norway, reached resolution in early 2024, nearly four
years after its completion. The outcome entailed annual compensation and
permission for the wind farm to remain operational, despite the 2021
ruling that the farm was unlawful.26) These [temporary solutions
perpetuate structural violence against Indigenous peoples by equating a
land's worth with financial value rather than its intrinsic
value.]{.underline} [Indigenous communities are forced to seek justice
through colonial structures, often resulting in compensation that
doesn't solve the root issue.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} approach
[undermines]{.underline} [the principles outlined in]{.underline} the
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
([UNDRIP]{.underline}), particularly the concept of Free, Prior, and
Informed Consent (FPIC). UNDRIP and FPIC advocate for Indigenous
peoples' rights to give or withhold consent to projects affecting their
lands and resources, emphasizing genuine participation and respect for
their sovereignty. [Without adhering to these standards, temporary
measures fail to address the deeper issues of autonomy and cultural
significance, perpetuating a cycle of marginalization and
injustice.]{.underline}27)

Conclusion

[The shift towards **renewable resources** holds the potential to
contribute **significantly** to the **decolonization** of the energy
sector, provided Indigenous governance and practices are **integrated**
into the process]{.underline}. [It is **vital** for these processes to
be **guided** by **Indigenous leadership** in order to **reduce** the
impact of **colonialism** in **climate change mitigation**]{.underline}.
Additionally, [without a full recognition of the structural]{.underline}
and cultural [ways in which governments perpetuate
conflicts]{.underline} [stemming from the oil and gas
industry]{.underline}, [these practices will continue to increase in the
renewable energy sector]{.underline}. Within Canada and Norway, there is
significant room available to improve the systems in which Indigenous
peoples have increased dialogue in decision-making processes.
[Meaningful engagement requires addressing power dynamics in the energy
sector and confronting colonial legacies that perpetuate inequality and
marginalization.]{.underline} [By prioritizing Indigenous rights and
knowledge, a more just and sustainable future can be built for Arctic
states and the people living in them.]{.underline}

Moreover, [true reconciliation and progress in decolonizing the energy
sector depend on **concrete actions**]{.underline} beyond mere
consultations. [It necessitates the implementation of policies that not
only acknowledge but also actively incorporate traditional ecological
knowledge and Indigenous management practices.]{.underline} This means
providing Indigenous communities with genuine control over resource
development in their territories, ensuring fair and equitable
benefit-sharing, and creating legal frameworks that safeguard their
rights and lands. As Canada and Norway move forward, embedding these
principles into their national and international energy policies will be
crucial in achieving long-term sustainability and justice for Indigenous
peoples and the broader global community.

Despite a torrent of media attention (Bennett 2021; Herrmann 2019;
Marino 2012), [many rural Alaska Natives continue to feel abandoned and
marginalized by a "distant bureaucracy"]{.underline} (Marino and Ribot
2012). [Systems that are putatively designed to aid these communities,
such as federal grant programs, often prove to be inaccessible, or
navigable only with the assistance of professional grant writers and
civil engineers.]{.underline} [The fundamental principle of
self-determination]{.underline} --- which is critical to effective
Alaska Native government (Cornell and Kalt 2003) --- [is complicated by
a bureaucracy that is broadly out of step with the administrative
capacity of small sovereign communities, Indigenous]{.underline} or
settler. In 2020, the Alaska Federation of Natives approved a resolution
stating, "The regulations and requirements of most federal programs,
including FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, are developed for the
contiguous United States \[i.e., excluding Alaska\]. By design, they
prevent vital resources from being available to our communities"
(Increased Coordination 2020).

To date, the [federal government's response to environmental change in
Alaska Native villages has been, by its own admission, inadequately
coordinated and underfunded (]{.underline}US GAO, 2022). Several reports
by the GAO have [pointed to these failures and recommended pathways for
change, many of which do not require acts of Congress and could be
enacted through executive and agency action]{.underline} (US Government
Accountability Office 2003, 2009, 2020, 2022). These [recommendations,
and the principles underlying them, are echoed in other government
publications]{.underline} (Status of Tribes and Climate Change 2021;
2018 National Climate Assessment, Ch. 15). A number of academic
publications have also pointed to [shortcomings and pitfalls in current
systems]{.underline} (Bergstrom et al. 2022; Bronen and Chapin 2013;
Marino 2012, 2015; Pennington 2023; Ristroph 2017, 2021; Shearer 2012).

Some of the most frequently cited [barriers to environmental adaptation
include]{.underline} (1) the high cost of construction in rural Alaska,
where the estimated of relocating a single village exceeds US\$100
million in many instances (US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District
2006); (2) a [lack of funding allocated to Alaska Native communities by
government entities relative to the need for infrastructure
development;]{.underline} (3) poor coordination between a mul- titude of
federal agencies with overlapping mandates; and (4) barriers to
accessing federal funds, e.g., through cost matching requirements.

These are [policy issues]{.underline}. But behind these hurdles is a
[historical and cultural backdrop of fraught engagement that creates
chronic obstacles]{.underline} to Alaska [Native governments partnering
with federal agencies with the capacity to fund infrastructure-scale
projects.]{.underline} The [friction of working collaboratively across a
vast geographic and cultural distance]{.underline}, from rural Alaska to
Washington, D.C., [underpins the feeling of disenfranchisement in
village communities]{.underline}. This [leads to poor engagement and
coordination, undermining service delivery and dispar- aging the "trust
responsibility"]{.underline} (Case and Voluck 2002) that [the federal
government has]{.underline} with Alaska [Native
communities]{.underline}.

Just days into his second term[, President Trump's Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) issued a directive to freeze all federal
grants,]{.underline} temporarily [halting access to trillions in funding
for states, Native American Tribal governments, municipalities,
nonprofit organizations,]{.underline} and other entities in the United
States and around the world. While the initial order was rescinded
within days, the [administration has continued its legal efforts to
ensure it could enact a government-wide funding freeze]{.underline} in
the future. In the coming months, a federal appeals court will hear
arguments for the case New York v. Trump, which will decide whether the
executive branch has the legal authority to unilaterally suspend federal
grants en masse.

This brief explores what's at stake for [Native American Tribes and
people when the federal government stymies grant funding]{.underline}.
Distinct from other populations in the country, [Tribes have a
government-to-government relationship with the United States, which
maintains trust and treaty obligations that require it to meet the
economic and social needs of Tribes and Native American
people]{.underline}. As such, [when the federal government withholds
funding from Tribes and Native American people, it's not just a policy
change.]{.underline} It's a [violation of those commitments---putting
essential services at risk and undermining Tribal governing
capacity.]{.underline}

This piece does not assess the [impact of the recently passed One Big
Beautiful Bill Act, which implemented many of the Trump administration's
budget priorities and further affected funding for Tribes and Native
Americans.]{.underline} Our future research will aim to explore the
impact of that policy on Native American communities.

The impact of a federal grant freeze on Native American people

The [federal government's legal obligations to Native Americans are
well-established]{.underline}. For nearly two hundred years, the Supreme
Court has consistently reaffirmed the legal and moral responsibilities
of the government to the interests and welfare of Native people through
the protection of their land, natural resources, and access to federal
services commensurate with the rest of the United States.

[Federal services which the United States provides for Indians are
frequently viewed as a matter of charity]{.underline}. The [erroneous
notion is widely prevalent that in their relationship with the Federal
Government, the Indians have been the regular recipients of unearned
bounties.]{.underline} In reality, federal services were, in earlier
years, [largely a matter of self-protection for the white man or partial
compensation to the Indian for land cessions or other benefits received
by the United States]{.underline}. In recent years such services have
been continued, partly as a result of [the failure of the states to
render certain essential public services to the Indians]{.underline},
because of their special relation to the Federal Government.

[Despite this, a May survey of Tribes conducted by the Native American
Fish and Wildlife Society found that even as the OMB funding freeze memo
was rescinded, 60% of Tribes were experiencing funding freezes, and over
a quarter had experienced a grant cancellation]{.underline}. Another
recent analysis of grant cancellations data from the Department of
Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) [determined that nearly a third of all
cancelled grant programs contain the word "Tribal," making it the single
most-commonly flagged keyword in the database.]{.underline} The data,
therefore, suggest that programs serving [Native people and communities
are not being exempted from the termination of grants and programs that
conflict with the Trump administration's policies on climate, education,
and racial equity.]{.underline}

As litigation around OMB's funding freeze continues, it is essential
that federal decisionmakers recognize the [unique basis of funding for
Tribes and Native American people. Funding to Indian Country is rooted
in longstanding, legally-binding agreements between the United States
and sovereign Tribal nations---not race, climate, or DEI. Efforts to
freeze or cancel funding to Native American people should be recognized
as a violation of these agreements, and considered dangerously
detrimental to the government-to-government relationship between Tribes
and the United States government.]{.underline}

## Inherency/uniqueness -- Trump decreasing funding for Alaska green tech

### AT Trump cuts stop renewable efforts

#### HR1 guts renewable credits -- raising the burden on indigenous project to finish fast 

**Oxendine, staff writer for Tribal Business News focusing on Native
entrepreneurship, 25**

Chesley, "Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' accelerates clean energy cuts,
threatens tribal projects", Tribal Business News, July 11^th^,
https://www.tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/energy/15208-trump-s-big-beautiful-bill-accelerates-clean-energy-cuts-threatens-tribal-projects,
HDCSW 07-15-2025 IS

HR 1 [accelerates the phaseout of elective pay tax credits for renewable
projects, which could reduce project costs by 30% to 50% by allowing
tribes to claim tax refunds on their clean energy
buildouts]{.underline}, according to prior Tribal Business News
reporting.

The phaseout comes in two forms: Projects that can spend 5% of their
budgeted building costs or begin construction by July 4, 2026, can have
up to 4 years to put that project in service and still claim the credit.
For larger buildouts still in the planning phase unable to meet that
goal, they must be in service by the end of 2027. That's an unworkable
time frame for utility-minded projects, according to Cheri Smith,
president and CEO of the nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy.

"The minimum on most of these projects is five years, and that's
assuming everything goes well," Smith told Tribal Business News. "You
could maybe stand up a project in three to four years if everything's
perfect, but President Trump's tariffs mean that people have been
hoarding parts of the supply chain. There's substation equipment out
there that's not available for years."

[The grace period afforded to projects that have begun construction by
July 2026 means that community-scale builds should still be able to
claim the credit]{.underline}, according to attorney Pilar Thomas,
partner at Quarles and Brady law firm. Tribes with projects such as
rooftop solar for supporting administration buildings or homes should
proceed quickly, Thomas told Tribal Business News.

"[The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a big step backwards]{.underline},
but [I\'m not quite as pessimistic as some, because most tribes are
doing smaller projects that can get that 5 percent down or construction
started by next year]{.underline}, or be in service by 2027," Thomas
said. "You've got to move, but I think [tribes are doing mostly smaller
projects for themselves, and I think those are still
viable."]{.underline}

#### New markets tax credit provides funding incentives for tribal development 

**Oxendine, staff writer for Tribal Business News focusing on Native
entrepreneurship, 25**

Chesley, "Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' accelerates clean energy cuts,
threatens tribal projects", Tribal Business News, July 11^th^,
https://www.tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/energy/15208-trump-s-big-beautiful-bill-accelerates-clean-energy-cuts-threatens-tribal-projects,
HDCSW 07-15-2025 IS

There is one bright spot: the bill permanently reauthorizes the New
Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, which incentivizes private developers
to build in underserved areas in exchange for tax credits. While not as
generous as the energy-specific credits[, NMTCs have already supported
some tribal projects, and may account for a little --- not all --- of
the money lost when elective pay goes away]{.underline}, Thomas said.

"In the past, a handful of tribes have financed clean energy with NMTC,
and before we were able to get elective pay under the IRA, that was one
way to get basically free money for your energy project," Thomas said.
"There are lots of ways to (address these challenges)."

Thomas said she was [more concerned about the direct funding cuts,
particularly grants, loans and awards that would have provided important
pre-development funding, or helped get those projects in motion to claim
the tax credits]{.underline}.

## Squo development bad 

### Squo mining -- harms indigenous people 

**Mining harms Indigenous lands and communities**

**Horowitz, et al., Professor of Environmental Studies and American
Indian & Indigenous Studies, 24**

\[Leah, "Indigenous Peoples' relationships to large-scale mining in
post/colonial contexts", The Extractive Industries and Society, August
21, 2024, Science Direct, Accessed July 8, 2025, HDCSW-MA.\] 

Perhaps the [greatest environmental concerns for adjacent Indigenous
communities arise from mining's substantial and complex waste
products.]{.underline} The vast quantities of physical wastes
([overburden, waste rock, and tailings) produced may be stored at the
surface or deposited in nearby water bodies, including lakes, rivers, or
ocean inlets]{.underline} (Lottermoser 2010; Sondergaard et al. 2011;
Hudson-Edwards et al. 2011). [Mine tailings have the potential to
pollute local watercourses through physical erosion, acid drainage, and
the mobilization of heavy metals or trace process chemicals, damaging
local fisheries and polluting drinking waters]{.underline} (Kirsch 2014;
Byrne et al. 2012; Horowitz 2010). Tailings impoundments (dams)
constructed to retain and, in some cases, treat tailings effluent are,
themselves, massive landscape features subject to leaks and failures,
large and small. When constructed in upstream, often mountainous
locations, these failures can be catastrophic, resulting in massive
flows that threaten downstream communities with inundation, property
damage, and death (Roche et al. 2017). [Ore processing is also a
significant source of pollution and toxicity affecting nearby
communities.]{.underline} Smelters are notorious polluters, due to the
airborne release of toxic smoke and gasses (containing carbon dioxide,
mercury, arsenic, and other contaminants) and the [production of slag
and ash that may be released or deposited to nearby lands or
waters]{.underline} (Lottermoser 2010). These [contaminants can affect
surrounding plant, animal, and human health, impacting local land
use.]{.underline}

[At Canada's Giant Mine, arsenic deposition from gold roasting not only
poisoned members of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation and domestic
animals, but also, at closure, left behind a comprehensively
contaminated local landscape and massive toxic site]{.underline}
(Beckett 2021; Sandlos and Keeling 2016a).

## AT Trump Thumps 

#### Cuts violate trust doctrine -- so likely illegal

Chronicle in Lewis County, Washington state, 25**

https://stateline.org/2025/03/04/for-indian-country-federal-cuts-decimate-core-tribal-programs/,
HDCSW 07-15-2025 IS

[President Donald Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce and
government spending have reverberated across Indian Country, leaving
tribes with deep uncertainty about their health clinics, schools, police
agencies and wildfire crews.]{.underline}

[Native officials say the cuts could hit a vast array of core public
services in tribal communities]{.underline} --- even though the federal
government is legally required to provide those services.

"These are real jobs that our society depends on. These are cops, nurses
in clinics, people who manage our forests and fisheries," said W. Ron
Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe in Washington state and
a longtime leader on Native sovereignty issues.

"You can't just come in with a chainsaw and slash everything and think
you can get away with undermining this \[responsibility\]."

Allen, like many tribal leaders, flew to Washington, D.C., last week to
lobby federal officials to change course. Tribal experts note that the
cuts will be felt far beyond reservation boundaries.

"[This is going to destroy whole regional economies in rural areas
around the country,]{.underline}" said Matthew Fletcher, an Indian law
professor at the University of Michigan and a member of the Grand
Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

[The federal government's unique role in supporting tribal services is
not an act of generosity. It's a legal mandate based on treaty rights
guaranteed to tribal nations in exchange for conceding
land]{.underline}. Tribes across the country signed nearly 400 treaties
in the 18th and 19th centuries, and modern legal efforts have reaffirmed
the feds' obligation to uphold those promises.

[In addition to the specific rights outlined in those treaties, the
federal government also must uphold its trust responsibility to
tribes]{.underline} --- a legal obligation under which the United States
must protect tribal sovereignty and provide basic social services for
tribal nations.

Many legal experts say [the Trump administration's efforts to gut
federal agencies and cut off funds to Native communities likely violate
the government's obligations]{.underline}. Tribal leaders have called on
Trump to reverse the cuts --- and earned at least one reprieve last
month when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
verbally rescinded layoffs at the Indian Health Service.

"There's certainly a lot of trepidation in Indian Country because so
many tribal programs rely on federal funding," said Gussie Lord,
managing attorney of the Tribal Partnerships Program with Earthjustice,
an environmental law group. "These are absolutely legal obligations
based on the federal trust responsibility."

Some tribal observers also fear that Trump's administration could roll
back regulations that allow tribes to protect their water quality.
That's imperative for tribal members whose diet features high amounts of
traditional foods such as salmon and wild rice.

Meanwhile, [Trump has pledged to block funding for DEI programs ---
efforts to boost diversity, equity and inclusion. Tribes told Stateline
they have been warned by federal agency insiders that many of their
grants could be at risk. Native leaders are pushing Trump officials to
acknowledge that the feds' relationship with tribes is based on their
status as sovereign nations, not racial preference]{.underline}.

[Tribes are still working to understand how their communities will be
affected, and many tribal nations and organizations did not respond to
interview requests.]{.underline} Some observers have noted that Trump's
penchant for targeting his political enemies may make some officials
wary of putting their tribe in the crosshairs by speaking out publicly.

Officials at the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Indian Health
Service and the Bureau of Indian Education did not respond to interview
requests.

[It is now too late to save summer
[Arctic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic) sea ice,]{.underline}
research has shown, and scientists say [preparations need to be made for
the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is
likely to occur as a result]{.underline}.

[Analysis shows that even if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply
reduced, the Arctic will be ice-free in September in coming decades. The
study also shows that if emissions decline slowly or continue to rise,
the first ice-free summer could be in the 2030s, a decade earlier than
previous projections.]{.underline}

The research shows that [90% of the melting is the result of
human-caused global heating, with natural factors accounting for the
rest.]{.underline}

Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has shrunk by
13% a decade, in one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Arctic
sea ice reaches its annual minimum at the end of summer, in September,
and in 2021 it was at its [[second lowest
extent]{.underline}](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/)
on record.

"Unfortunately it has become too late to save Arctic summer sea ice,"
said Prof Dirk Notz, of the University of Hamburg, Germany, who was part
of the study team. ["As scientists, we've been warning about the loss of
Arctic summer sea ice for decades.]{.underline} This is now the first
major component of the Earth system that we are going to lose because of
global warming. People didn't listen to our warnings.

"[This brings another warning bell, that the kind of projections that
we've made for other components of the Earth system will start unfolding
in the decades to come."]{.underline}

Other climate scientists said in 2022 that the world was on the brink of
[[multiple disastrous tipping
points]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/08/world-on-brink-five-climate-tipping-points-study-finds).

Prof Seung-Ki Min, of Pohang University, South Korea, who led the new
study, said: ["The most important impact for human society will be the
increase in weather extremes that we are experiencing now, such as
heatwaves, wildfires and floods. We need to reduce CO2 emissions more
ambitiously and also prepare to adapt to this faster Arctic warming and
its impacts on human society and ecosystems."]{.underline}

#### Past tipping point -- arctic ice proves rapid warming even in low emissions scenarios 

Carrington, Environmental editor at the Guardian, 23

\[Damian Carrington, "Too late now to save Arctic summer ice, climate

In 2021, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change]{.underline}](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) (IPCC)
concluded that the Arctic would not lose its summer ice if emissions
were cut sharply and global temperature rises were limited to 2C. But
[the new research]{.underline}, [[published in the journal Nature
Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38511-8),
projects the loss of summer sea ice in the 2050s in the low emissions
scenario.]{.underline}

The IPCC report concluded that [the Arctic would lose its summer
ice]{.underline} in the 2040s in intermediate and high emissions
scenarios, but the [new research advances that by a decade into the
2030s]{.underline}.

In the study, [the scientists first established how much rising
greenhouse gases have contributed to ice melting compared with natural
factors such as variation in the sun's intensity and emissions from
volcanoes. "Humans really are to blame for almost all the loss of Arctic
sea ice we have been observing]{.underline}," Notz said.

The scientists used this information to model future melting and found
that the models underestimated the pace of melting compared with
observations of ice in the Arctic from 1979 to 2019.

[Calibrating the models to be consistent with the observations led to
the projections of faster melting and an ice-free summer even in the low
emissions scenario.]{.underline} In [the intermediate and high emissions
scenarios, August and October also become ice-free by about 2080, the
study found]{.underline}.

[It is not possible to pinpoint a particular year for the first ice-free
summer because of natural variability in the climate
system.]{.underline}

[Faster melting of Arctic sea ice leads to a vicious circle of more
heating, because the dark ocean exposed as ice melts absorbs more heat
from the sun. The result is faster warming in the Arctic]{.underline},
and scientists have increasing evidence that [this is [weakening the jet
stream](https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/declining-sea-ice-changing-atmosphere)
and leading to more extreme weather events]{.underline} in North
America, Europe and Asia.

The searing [[heatwave in the Pacific north-west of
America]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/21/pacific-northwest-heatwave-dome-climate-change)
in 2021 and the [[catastrophic floods in Pakistan in
2022]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/15/pakistan-floods-made-up-to-50-worse-by-global-heating)
are the type of events that may be increasing in likelihood because of a
weaker jet stream.

Min [said faster Arctic heating also accelerated the melting of the
Greenland ice cap, driving up sea level, and the melting of permafrost
regions, releasing more greenhouse gases.]{.underline} Polar bears and
other wildlife in the Arctic and the Indigenous people of the region all
rely on sea ice.

Prof Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and
[[Ice]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ice) Data
Center at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US, who was not part
of the study team, said: ["The key message is that we are pretty much
destined to lose the Arctic's sea ice cover in late summer. The question
is: when will this occur?]{.underline}

"[Over the past decade, there has not been much of a downward trend in
September sea ice, which reflects the natural variability in the system.
This hiatus will not last, but it shows the difficulties in making
predictions.]{.underline} About a decade ago, I mused that the Arctic
might lose its summer sea ice by 2030. That may have been an overly
aggressive statement. While from the present study 2030 is still in the
running, I'm going with sometime in the 2040s -- that's still not very
far away."

["We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster,"]{.underline}
the report begins. "[This is a global emergency beyond any doubt. Much
of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled. We are stepping into a
critical and unpredictable new phase of the climate
crisis."]{.underline}

The report is the latest such annual peer-reviewed paper published in
the journal BioScience by an international team of scientists led by
Oregon State ecologist William Ripple.

The authors found that [25 of 35 "planetary vital signs" reached record
levels last year, including global temperatures, human climate
pollution, fossil fuel subsidies, heat-related mortality rates, meat
production, and loss of forest cover.]{.underline}

After decades of warnings from climate scientists and efforts by some
policymakers and activists, "the world has made only very minor headway
on climate change, in part because of stiff resistance from those
benefiting financially from the current fossil-fuel-based system," it
says. "[We are currently going in the wrong direction and our increasing
fossil-fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are driving us
toward a climate catastrophe.]{.underline} We fear the danger of climate
breakdown."

They did note a few positive indicators like clean energy production.

"Of course, the situation is not hopeless," wrote Harvard science
historian and study co-author Naomi Oreskes via email. "What we want
people to understand is that, [while there has been progress --
particularly in the price and deployment of renewables -- it's not
nearly enough. And the atmosphere does not respond to our intentions. It
responds to chemistry.]{.underline}"

The report calls for "rapidly phasing down fossil fuel use" by
ratcheting up the carbon price in wealthy countries and using some of
the proceeds to fund policies to stop climate change and adaptation
programs to reduce damage from climate disasters. It also urges sharp
reductions in emissions of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, to "slow
the near-term rate of global warming, helping to avoid tipping points
and extreme climate impacts."

[Without a course correction]{.underline}, the report warned, "[climate
change could cause many millions of additional deaths by
2050.]{.underline}"

gases from the atmosphere.

[The UN Environment Programme's latest Emissions Gap Report]{.underline}
2024 flatly [states that continuation of climate warming mitigation via
current government policies has a 66% chance of resulting in 3.1°C of
warming by 2100. The G20 nations, the principal drivers of global
warming]{.underline} (contributing 77% of global emissions in 2023),
[have the resources and capacity to get the job done.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, their priorities are elsewhere[. Nowhere is that more
evident than in the U.S., which has recently withdrawn entirely from the
Paris Agreement and paused efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Other countries are likely to follow suit.]{.underline}

[Planning for a 3°C world is now a necessity. The consequences of a
potential 3°C world are much the same as the hazards the CAC has
highlighted over the last five years]{.underline}, but going forward the
hazards are bigger, more frequent and nastier. [For a start, the list
includes extreme weather, intense heat waves, the expanding range of
insect-borne diseases, sea level rise, the death of coral reefs,
wildfires fed by heat and drought, inland flooding from extreme rainfall
events, and rapid intensification of tropical cyclones over warmer
oceans]{.underline}.

Governance systems

**policy misalignment**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[75\]. This
[[fragmentation creates barriers to adaptation, as it **hinders** the
development of cohesive and effective adaptation

adaptation efforts are hindered by conflicts between federal,
provincial, and Indigenous governance authorities. [Inuit communities in

\[102,19\]. While the Sami Parliament (Sámediggi) in Norway provides
some level of self-determination and representation, it does not have
exclusive lawmaking or fiscal powers, and final decision-making

## Impact - Climate change bad -- laundry list 

#### Climate change existential threat -- multiple reasons

[Climate change is our planet's greatest [existential
threat](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/ipcc-climate-change-reports-why-they-matter-everyone-planet)]{.underline}.
[If we don't limit greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil
fuels, the consequences of rising global temperatures include massive
crop and fishery collapse, the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of
species, and entire communities becoming uninhabitable]{.underline}.
While these outcomes may still be avoidable, [climate change is already
causing suffering and death. From raging wildfires and supercharged
storms, its compounding effects can be felt today, outside our own
windows.]{.underline}

[Understanding these impacts can help us prepare for what's here, what's
avoidable, and what's yet to come, and to better prepare and protect all
communities]{.underline}. Even though everyone is or will be affected by
climate change, [those living in the world's poorest countries---which
have [contributed
least](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/jake-schmidt/us-international-leadership-still-needed-after-climate-bill)
to the problem---are the most climate-vulnerable]{.underline}. They have
the fewest financial resources to respond to crises or adapt, and
they're closely dependent on a healthy, thriving natural world for food
and income. Similarly, [in the United States, it is most often
[low-income communities and communities of
color](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement) that
are on the frontlines of climate impacts.]{.underline} And because
climate change and rising inequality are interconnected crises, decision
makers must take action to combat both---and all of us must fight for
climate justice. Here's what you need to know about what we're up
against.

## Impact -- climate change bad -- diseases 

#### Climate change spreads Arctic diseases as warming, thawing permafrost, and ecosystem disruption fuel outbreaks in humans and wildlife.

**Rao et al, Senior Researcher at Norwegian Institute of Public Health,
25**

\[Shilpa, "Climate change and health in the Arctic", Scandinavian

[Infectious disease rates in humans across the Arctic are highly
variable, depending on country, ethnicity, disease, age and
gender.]{.underline} [Current trends in infectious diseases include the
re-emergence of tuberculosis (TB), high prevalence of sexually
transmitted diseases (STIs), introduction of new pathogens, such as
COVID-19, changes in the emergence of food- and waterborne diseases and
the spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, partly as a result of
climate change.]{.underline} [TB and STIs are a significant public
health burden in the Arctic populations, with higher incidence rates
compared with their respective country's general populations.
Environmental and climatic threats include increases in ocean and
atmospheric temperature, with resulting changes in biota, habitat,
foraging grounds, breeding areas and migration routes, and changes in
disease-vector populations, ranges and life cycles.]{.underline} A
recent study has highlighted that the Arctic represents a changing world
where pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and maritime activity
are likely driving forward occurrence of infectious diseases.

[Many Arctic pathogens may have environmental hosts that are still
unknown; for example, Coxiella burnetti]{.underline} (causing human Q
fever) [has recently been identified in northern fur seals and
Franciscella tularensis]{.underline} (causing human tularaemia) [in
polar bears.]{.underline} Environmental reservoirs for potentially new
Arctic infections are unknown. [The ecology of Arctic pathogens requires
collaborative investigation, collating local and indigenous knowledge,
in partnership with science. There is an increasing infectious disease
threat to Arctic wildlife, which includes shifts in disease emergence,
rising potential for new and old reemerging pathogens and increased
infection risk for the human residents.]{.underline}

[Warmer ocean and terrestrial temperatures can increase the growth rates
of pathogens and animals, including insect vectors and biting pests,
affecting human health and wellbeing. Ticks and tickborne diseases, such
as the Borrelia bacteria causing Lyme disease, are gradually moving
towards polar regions as temperatures rise.]{.underline} Extreme
precipitation may result in flooding and disruption of water/sanitation
infrastructure, elevating the risk for waterborne disease outbreaks.
Indirectly, climatic factors also affect infectious disease transmission
by altering human behaviour.

[Climate-related extreme weather and disasters are contributing greatly
to human suffering]{.underline} (figure 4). Increasing heat and rainfall
extremes are now far outside the historical climate (Robinson et al.
2021). The [rapid increase in average global temperatures]{.underline}
(figure 1e) [has led to a massive rise in the incidence of heat
extremes]{.underline} (figure 3p). This is [linked to many adverse human
outcomes, including direct mortality, increased healthcare costs, mental

## Impact -- climate change -- flooding 

### Empirics 

#### Climate change induced flooding and wildfires proves climate crisis now

7/15/25\]

In recent months, the [planet has sent us some of its loudest warnings
yet. From wildfires raging across Southern Europe and North America to
devastating floods sweeping through South Asia and parts of Africa, 2025
has become a year marked by extreme climate event]{.underline}s. The
question on everyone's mind now is sobering but necessary: Are we
[nearing the tipping point of climate change]{.underline}? This question
is no longer just for scientists or politicians to answer. It's a
reality that farmers, families, children, and entire communities are now
experiencing firsthand. [The climate crisis is no longer about the
future. It is happening now.]{.underline} Wildfires That Refuse to Be
Contained In the summer of 2025, wildfires have erupted across many
regions with shocking speed and strength. Canada has faced one of its
worst fire seasons on record, with millions of acres of forest land
burned and entire towns evacuated. In California and Oregon, flames
swallowed entire neighborhoods, displacing thousands of residents and
releasing dangerous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. What [makes
these fires more intense than before? Rising global temperatures,
combined with longer drought seasons and lower humidity, have created
ideal conditions for fire to thrive.]{.underline} These are not ordinary
wildfires. They are fast-moving, unpredictable, and much harder to
control than in past years. In many cases, firefighters are simply
trying to redirect the flames rather than stop them. What's most
heartbreaking is that behind each statistic are people --- mothers
carrying children through smoke-filled streets, elderly citizens losing
homes they built decades ago, and workers risking their lives to save
others. This isn't just a climate crisis. It's a human crisis.
Floodwaters That Rise Too Fast While some regions burn, others drown. In
early 2025, Bangladesh was hit by its worst flooding in over a decade.
Rivers overflowed with such force that entire villages vanished
overnight. Streets turned into rivers, homes into floating debris. In
parts of Pakistan and India, monsoon rains came earlier and harder than
usual, affecting millions and damaging vital crops. [Even in places not
traditionally known for flooding --- like parts of Germany, the United
States, and South Korea --- urban flash floods have become frighteningly
common.]{.underline} These floods are not just caused by heavy rain but
by poor urban planning and outdated infrastructure that cannot handle
modern-day climate stress. [The link between these floods and climate
change is clear. Warmer temperatures hold more moisture in the
atmosphere, leading to heavier downpours. Melting glaciers and rising
sea levels also contribute to flooding, particularly in low-lying
region]{.underline}s.

#### Hydroclimate whiplash causing more flooding

[The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information]{.underline}
(NCEI) [report that the 2024 average temperature across the contiguous
United States was 55.5°F (13°C). This is 3.5°F (1.9 °C) above the
20th-century average, making it the warmest year on record since
measurements began in 1895. The year got off to a horrific start with
the catastrophic wildfires surrounding Los Angeles, boosted by a
phenomenon called hydroclimate whiplash---rapid swings between intensely
wet and intensely dry weather.]{.underline} The wet period leads to
rapid and abundant growth of shrubs and grasses, which become tinder-dry
in subsequent hot, dry weather.

[Hydroclimate whiplash set the stage for the Los Angeles
fires]{.underline}: multiple atmospheric rivers in the winter of
2022-2023 dumped rain and heavy snowfall, only to be followed by the
record hot, dry summer of 2024. [Wildfires were virtually inevitable at
that point and strong Santa Ana winds drove the fires to spread rapidly.
As the global climate warms, a recent by UCLA's]{.underline} Daniel
Swain and colleagues [shows that hydroclimate whiplash has increased by
31% to 66% since the mid-twentieth century. Climate change is powering
the increase, such that it will more than double should global
temperatures rise to 3°C above pre-industrial levels.]{.underline}
Beyond the U.S., the impacts of climate warming are increasingly
evident.

[In mid-April,]{.underline} for example, [a severe heatwave hit India
and Pakistan.]{.underline} New Delhi reported multiple incidences of
temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F), as much as 5°C above the seasonal
average. Parts of Pakistan experienced temperatures up to 49°C (120°F).
[The analysts conclude that the April heatwave was driven by "very
exceptional meteorological conditions whose characteristics can mostly
be ascribed to human driven climate change. As an inevitable consequence
of a warming climate---both in the atmosphere and in the
oceans---tropical cyclone intensity has increased around the
world]{.underline} over approximately the past 40 years. [In the
Atlantic Basin, the National Hurricane Center suggests that the overall
frequency of intense hurricanes, specifically major hurricanes (Category
3 or higher), has increased in recent decades. Recent NOAA
research shows that, while the overall number of hurricanes in a season
may not change drastically over the long term, the likelihood of
extremely active seasons is increasing. ]{.underline}

**[Climate change affects the Arctic environment and organisms within
it, including humans.]{.underline} In [Greenland, the ice sheet and
peripheral glaciers are rapidly losing mass, resulting in sea level rise
and changes in ocean environments]{.underline}** (Box et al., 2022;
Smith et al., 2020). In northwestern Greenland, **[natural hazards
triggered by climate change have been observed]{.underline}** for at
least the last decade. For example, **l[andslides occurred after
heavy]{.underline}** **[precipitation]{.underline}** in 2016 and 2017,
which damaged a building in Siorapaluk (Sugiyama, 2020; Watanabe et al.,
2022). In 2015 and 2016, because of high air temperatures and heavy
rain, increased discharge from a glacier caused flooding in Qaanaaq.
This resulted in the destruction of a road and collapse of a bridge
connecting the village to Qaanaaq Airport (Kondo et al., 2021). Similar
incidents happened again in 2023 **[due to heavy
precipitation]{.underline}** (Fig. 1a). **[Climate change is a common
link between these events, and rainfall has been increasing in
Greenlan]{.underline}**d (Box et al., 2023). Moreover, the mean air
temperature in Qaanaaq during the summer months of June--August has
increased by more than 1 ◦C in the last two decades (Wang et al., 2021).
**[Climate change affects the distribution of organisms including a
trending poleward shift of subarctic species habitats]{.underline}**
(Wassmann et al., 2011)[. Another consequence of increasing glacier
melting and increased precipitation is the greater amounts of
runoff]{.underline} along the coast of Qaanaaq. During the **[flood
event in 2023, turbid water discharge from a glacial river was observed
along the coast near the village]{.underline}** (Fig. 1b). Such an event
might have affected the dump site, which is also located on the coast
(Fig. 1c). Additionally, river runoff controls the amount of mercury
discharge into the ocean (Hawkings et al., 2021) although the
significance of mercury discharge from the Greenland Ice sheet is
controversial (Jørgensen et al., 2024). In northwestern **[Greenland,
residents hunt and consume marine mammals and fish]{.underline}**
(Nuttall, 2020). T**[herefore, it is important to understand the ecology
of high trophic level species, because heavy metals bioaccumulate in
marine organisms.]{.underline}** Under the framework of Japanese
multidisciplinary Arctic research projects, ArCS (Arctic Challenge for
Sustainability, 2015--2020) and ArCS II (2020--2025), we continue to
study the coastal marine ecosystem in the Gulf of Inglefield,
northwestern Greenland. The objective of this research is to understand
the ecology of marine organisms and their interplay with human and
rapidly changing environments (Sugiyama et al., 2021). Our research
activities include: acoustic monitoring of marine mammals (Podolskiy and

## Impact -- climate change bad -- health 

#### Climate change in the Arctic intensifies health risks---escalating injury, disease, and mortality, especially for Indigenous communities.

[Direct health effects of climate change may result from increased
exposure to extreme weather events and from extreme events such as
falling through ice.]{.underline} [When one part of the Arctic warms,
the strength and direction of wind and water currents can alter,
resulting in a decrease in temperature elsewhere in the
Arctic.]{.underline} [Thus,]{.underline} climate impacts may be neither
linear nor smooth. In the Arctic, the rise in heat extremes and decrease
in cold extremes especially pronounced, in association with
intensification of the hydrological cycle and other changes. [Climate
change is likely to have both positive and negative direct health
impacts on health in the Arctic.]{.underline}

Mortality rates from unintentional injuries are already
disproportionately high in Arctic regions, especially for Indigenous
peoples. [Rates of drowning in Inuit populations have been reported as
six times higher than for non-Indigenous populations, and eight times
higher for snowmobile-related drownings. Hospitalization rates for
unintentional injuries from land transportation in areas with high Inuit
populations are greater for adults, children and youth. Climate change
is expected to significantly impact weather conditions in the future and
thus increase this form of burden for Arctic populations.]{.underline}
[The Arctic has long been an area at high risk]{.underline} from
ultra-violet (UV) radiation damage.

Highly reflective snow surfaces result [in damaging levels of UV to
unprotected eyes and vertical surfaces]{.underline} including faces,
trees and shrubs. [High UV levels in the Arctic are known to cause
sunburn (erythema) and snow blindness (photokeratitis) under normal
conditions. UV is an identified immune suppressant, with long term
health consequences including cataracts and skin diseases, including
cancer.]{.underline} Normally, ozone in the stratosphere shields the
Earth from much harmful UV radiation. However, [recent measurements in
the Arctic show that climate change is contributing to long-term
decreases in the amount of ozone high overhead]{.underline}. In
addition, scientists have observed more frequent episodes of extremely
low ozone levels, particularly during the springtime, due to climate
change. [The fragile ecosystems of the Arctic, with its peoples and
human-constructed surfaces, may thus face additional challenges due to
ozone depletion associated modifications to UV-B and UV-A
radiation.]{.underline}

First and foremost, many of us can expect escalating heat and
unrelenting heat waves. [The CAC took an in depth look at future warming
and heatwaves three years ago]{.underline} (Overheated: Summer
2002, Part 1 and Part 2). At that time we suggested that climate warming
might reach as much as 3°C by 2100. [The World Health Organization found
that between 2000 and 2016, the number of people exposed to heatwaves
increased by around 125 million. The greatest risk lies in countries in
or near the tropics, where temperatures already approach human limits.
Conversely, higher latitudes, will benefit from a decrease in
cold-temperature deaths as the climate warms. In the U.S., more
than 21,000 heat-related deaths occurred from 1999 through 2023, with
the annual death toll more than doubling over the 24 years.]{.underline}

[A study of Europe's 2023 heat wave found that it resulted in more than
47,000 deaths. Until recently, the theoretical limit was thought to be a
35°C "wet-bulb temperature"]{.underline}[, equivalent to 35°C (95°F) at
100% humidity or 46°C (115°F) at 50% humidity. However, ]{.mark}[recent
research at Penn State University showed that the wet-bulb threshold is
actually lower --- about 31°C (87°F) at 100% humidity for healthy, young
adults.]{.underline} []{.mark}[By 2050, the global population over 60
years old is forecast to be about 2.1 billion]{.underline}, roughly 21%
of the total[. Research]{.underline} by Giacomo Falchetta and colleagues
[predicts that as a result of rising temperatures, the number of people
at risk worldwide from chronic extreme heat will at least double by
2050, with the population of older people regularly exposed to both
chronic and acute heat increasing by about 200 million.]{.underline}

[These mental health challenges act as a barrier to

[[58]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343525000120#bib58).
These health issues reduce the adaptive capacity of individuals. This
represents both a barrier and a limit[. Food insecurity and health
disparities that arise from climate-induced changes in wildlife
availability represent limits]{.underline}, particularly for
subsistence-dependent communities. Many Indigenous Peoples experience a
sense of loss, anxiety, and uncertainty about the future
[[\[56\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343525000120#bib56)**.
In the North American Arctic, the loss of sea ice has led to 'ecological
grief', where individuals mourn the disappearance of traditional
landscapes, loss of cultural practices, and uncertainty about their
community's long-term survival**
[\[15\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343525000120#bib15)]{.underline}.
This psychological burden represents an adaptation limit, as policy
interventions cannot reverse existential grief tied to irreversible
ecological loss. 

### food 

#### Climate change intensifies Indigenous food security in the Arctic through species decline, disrupted hunting patterns, and threats to reindeer and marine mammal populations.

Rao et al, Senior Researcher, 25

\[Shilpa, "Climate change and health in the Arctic", Scandinavian
Journal of Public Health, March 13, 2025,
[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14034948241296309]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14034948241296309),
access date: 7/13/25, HDCSW SZ\]

The traditional diet varies among the Arctic nations. [In Canada,
Greenland, Alaska and the far-east of the Russian Federation there is
significant marine mammal consumption by Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} However[, in some parts of the Arctic --
particularly Finland, Sweden, Norway and Arctic Russia -- there is
significant hunting and consumption of terrestrial mammals. Furthermore,
reindeer herding is an important livelihood and reindeer meat
constitutes a significant amount of the diet of the indigenous
population of Saami people]{.underline} in Norway, Sweden, Finland and
Russia. [Fish consumption is also a significant part of the diet among
both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in many Arctic countries.
However, Arctic populations have been moving towards store-bought
'Western' foods for decades owing to greater accessibility,
affordability and also concerns about the health impacts from
contaminants in traditional and local foods. Higher reliance on imported
foods and higher cost of healthy foods contribute to unhealthy
diets.]{.underline}

The details and pace of these nutritional transitions vary across and
within the Arctic countries, but in general the shifts have been
greatest in urban areas and towns. [Such dietary changes may have
negative and positive impacts; their balance is often difficult to
ascertain. The benefits of diminished consumption of traditional and
local foods include significant reductions of contaminants measured in
the blood of pregnant women. Increased consumption of vegetables and
fruit can also occur in some cases. At the same time, studies have noted
troubling trends in deterioration of health status, including a rising
prevalence of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases. These
harms are triggered not only by increased intake of calorie-dense,
nutrient-poor foods, but also by reduced physical activity as the
incentive to hunt declines.]{.underline}

[A deterioration in dental health has also been observed, related to
higher consumption of sugary drinks, while the decline in
cardiometabolic health is related to reduced consumption of fish and
other traditional foods]{.underline} and consequently lower intakes of
omega-3-fatty acids, vitamin D and iodine. [The consequences of climate
change pose several threats to food systems and food security in the
Arctic region. Rising sea levels, changes in wind and precipitation
patterns, and more unpredictable and severe weather events have been
documented to result in a decline in fish stocks, birds and marine
mammals; species that are traditionally and culturally important, both
as food, and for human identity in the Arctic region]{.underline}.

[Climate change-induced increases in biting pests, such as mosquitos,
may also have negative consequences for reindeer and caribou
populations, and accordingly their role as a local
resource.]{.underline} Other climate change related phenomena included
unpredictable temperature fluctuation and heavier winds and rainfall[;
these may impact game mating and hunting times and alter fish migration
patterns. The overall consequences of this remain unclear. Arctic
communities are already burdened by significant disparities in food
security and health, and climate change enhances this through changes in
local food systems, food security and affordability.]{.underline}

[As climate change alters the Arctic environment]{.underline}, many
[Indigenous communities are forced to shift]{.underline} away
[from]{.underline} [traditional]{.underline} subsistence
[practices]{.underline}, [leading to increased dependence on expensive
technologies]{.underline} for food gath- ering, imported foods, and fuel
\[76\]. The reliance on technologies such as high-efficiency snowmobiles
and gasoline for transportation, advanced fishing equipment and boats
for food gathering and travelling, and GPS systems and satellite phones
for navigation has increased \[••20,23,84\]. However, [buying these
technologies is **costly**, imposing a significant **social** and
**financial strain** on communities and creating **social
inequities**]{.underline}. [This is exacerbated by an increased reliance
on expensive store- bought foods, a high cost of living, and dependence
on global markets and price fluctuations]{.underline} \[••65\].
[This]{.underline} eco- nomic shift [presents a **barrier** for
**lower-income house- holds** that cannot afford **adaptation
costs**]{.underline}, [as well as a **limit** for communities that have
surpassed economic feasibility thresholds.]{.underline}

[Inability to adapt due to financial constraints presents a significant
limit to adaptation]{.underline}. In Chukotka, Russia, many Indigenous
communities live in poverty, with limited access to resources and
infrastructure \[53\]. This [financial constraint creates a limit to
adaptation, as communities cannot afford the technologies or infra-
structure needed to cope with climate change.]{.underline} The [limited
mobility due to fixed settlements acts as a limit.]{.underline} [In
Alaska, many Indigenous communities were forcibly relocated to fixed
settlements]{.underline}. [These settlements are now vulnerable to
rising sea levels and permafrost thaw, limiting the ability of
communities to adapt through traditional mobility practices]{.underline}

[Climate change has had a profound impact on the living environment of
Arctic indigenous peoples, and thus, it merits special attention. The
Artic is characterised 'as the world's climate change
barometer']{.underline}.25 According to the reports of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), '[surface warming in
the Arctic will continue to be more pronounced than the global average
warming over the 21st century']{.underline}.26 It is expected that
['additional warming will lead to more frequent and intense marine
heatwaves and is projected to further amplify permafrost thawing and
loss of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, land ice and Arctic
sea]{.underline} ice'.27 [A significant decline in sea ice and glaciers
is already being witnessed]{.underline} in the Chukchi and Beaufort
seas.28 [Decline in seasonal sea ice and higher sea levels increase
coastal hazards, such as flooding and coastal erosion]{.underline}.29
Such changes have resulted in, and are projected to further [lead to,
restrictions on indigenous peoples' access to ancestral lands and
natural resources, loss of land and houses or forced relocation and mass
resettlements, which directly affect the enjoyment of the right to
property]{.underline}.30 In addition, [there have been serious
consequences for the main sources of income of indigenous communities,
as the thinning of ice makes it more difficult to hunt and fish and
climate change has led to the degradation of reindeer pastures and to a
lack of available food for reindeer herding]{.underline}.31

[Ocean warming and acidification are also responsible for the depletion
of fish stocks and decline in other marine species, limiting the
opportunities of Arctic indigenous people to access marine resources,
threatening their income, food security and cultural
heritage]{.underline}.32 [Reduction in sea ice may facilitate
overfishing, which, in turn, is likely to affect the fish stocks and the
fishing practices of Arctic indigenous peoples, many of whom rely on
small-scale subsistence fishing]{.underline}.33 Sea-level rise can also
change coastal configuration or lead to the partial or complete loss of
islands. This will affect the baselines from which maritime zones are
measured and may result in their reduction or disappearance. 34 [Such
scenario could severely limit the access of the Arctic indigenous
communities to natural resources, including their fishing
rights. ]{.underline}

[The Arctic is one of the coldest and least populated regions on Earth,
much of it covered by ice. But in recent years it has become one of the
most important sites of geopolitical tensions]{.underline} --- and a key
focus of American policy.Despite its inhospitality, land north of the
Arctic Circle has long been inhabited by Indigenous people like the
Inuit, Sami and Yukaghir and today includes territories belonging to
eight countries: Canada, Russia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark and the United States.In 1996, these countries formed the Arctic
Council --- a forum that includes all eight countries as member states
along with representatives from Indigenous groups. [But while the Arctic
was once envisioned as a neutral zone where research and conservation
could promote deeper international cooperation, multiple developments
since then have turned it into a site of competition]{.underline}.[The
number one issue facing the Arctic is climate change]{.underline}. Since
the 1990s, Arctic sea ice has declined by 7.6 trillion metric tons, with
the rate of loss increasing by 57%. [Besides contributing to rising sea
levels, the loss of ice also reduces global solar reflection. This
creates a feedback loop as the darker ocean water absorbs more heat,
causing more ice to melt, adversely affecting global weather
patterns]{.underline}.[The melting of Arctic ice also directly affects
local wildl]{.underline}ife, with polar bear populations projected to
decline by two-thirds in the next quarter-century as they lose their
hunting grounds.But where some see environmental disaster, others see
opportunity[. The melting ice is making Arctic trade routes more
navigable]{.underline}, providing shorter distances for transoceanic
shipping than current lanes using the Suez and Panama canals.
Furthermore, [increased navigability is expanding potential for
exploration and extraction of natural resources.The Arctic region is
estimated to hold over 20% of the world's remaining fossil fuel
reserves, with over 400 oil and gas fields already discovered.
Both]{.underline} [the seabed and offshore areas also hold vast
quantities of minerals]{.underline} ranging from staple commodities like
iron, gold, nickel and zinc to rare earth metals such as neodymium and
dysprosium, which are used in electronics and battery technology. [Even
traditional subsistence activity may be greatly altered and expanded as
global warming leads fish stocks to migrate north and more coastal land
becomes available for agriculture.\
Yet economic opportunities in the Arctic are emerging at a time of
increased geopolitical tensions, as countries scramble to secure
resources, stake territorial claims and develop
facilities]{.underline}.With 53% of the Arctic coastline under its
control, Russia has the largest presence in the region in terms of
civilian ports like Murmansk and Arkhangelsk as well as multiple
airfields and military bases along its northern border. More recently,
[Russia has moved to expand its claims to the Arctic seabed]{.underline}
at the same time that its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has led other
members of the Arctic Council to suspend cooperation with Moscow.\
While land jurisdiction in the Arctic is largely settled aside from a
few small disputes, maritime claims are much more complex. Control over
Arctic waters is generally governed by the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines multiple types of territorial
waters where a nation may have the right to restrict the activity of
foreign vessels. [These range from internal waters that are considered
part of a nation's sovereign territory to exclusive economic
zones]{.underline} where foreign ships may travel freely but cannot
extract resources.Although the United States played a formative role in
negotiating the treaty and abides by most of its provisions, it remains
one of the few countries that has not formally acceded to it because of
concerns about limitations it places on seabed mining.Even among UNCLOS
signatories, however, boundary definitions can vary. While Canada
considers parts of the Northwest Passage to lie within its territorial
waters, for example, most other nations including the United States
consider it to be an international strait where foreign ships may
transit.Similarly, Russia has claimed parts of the Northeast Passage
along its northern coastline as internal waters, moving to restrict the
right of passage in areas where it was previously allowed.Given these
disputes, the Transpolar Sea Route through the center of the Arctic
Ocean, which lies fully in international waters, will become more
attractive as polar ice continues to thaw.\
[The increasing importance of the Arctic has attracted the attention of
other powers without Arctic territory.]{.underline} Several of these
states have been admitted as observers in the Arctic Council, including
Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. [China, which is
also an observer, has unilaterally declared itself as a "near-Arctic
state"]{.underline} and has expanded both research and commercial
activity in the region by partnering with Russia as well as investing in
infrastructure in Norway, Iceland and Greenland.\
[China's increased presence in the Arctic alongside Russia's more
aggressive posture]{.underline} have been among the reasons cited for
U.S. President Donald Trump's insistence on annexing or buying
Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark. While Greenland already
contains a U.S. military base on its northwest coast, the discussion is
likely to result in a further militarization of the territory, even
under Denmark.[Satellites are also expected to play a major role in
exerting control within the Arctic,]{.underline} given the importance of
observation and monitoring in remote areas with poor communications
infrastructure.\
[What was once considered a frozen frontier with little to offer is
quickly becoming one of the most contested regions on Earth. And as the
planet heats up, competition in the Arctic will as well.]{.underline}

[[Projected changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and
extreme events pose numerous risks to ecosystems and the people who
depend on them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Risks differ according to the
characteristics of social and ecological systems. Some ecosystems,
[[such as those in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and Antarctic, [[are
susceptible to changes in temperature]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [changes
that will occur in these regions]{.underline}, which are seen as the
world\'s refrigerators, [have the potential to cause geopolitical
changes and disrupt the world\'s climate structure.]{.underline} [With
the effects]{.underline} of global [climate change, the current and
potential value of new energy basins, and the opening of sea
passageways, the Arctic is turning into a region with a high potential
for conflict rather than the cooperation]{.underline} of regional and
non-regional actors and becoming one of the geopolitical centers of
gravity of the world. [The Arctic]{.underline} is a [region with unique
geographical and climatic conditions]{.underline}, [various natural
resources, and strategic importance]{.underline}. With the melting of
glaciers, [this area, which has increased international interest, is
becoming an important center for both scientific research and commercial
activities.]{.underline} In this respect, the Arctic is the northernmost
region in the world and has many special geographical, astronomical, and
climatic features. Accordingly, the Arctic extends from 66.5° North
Parallel, centering on the North Pole, to 90° North. The Arctic is
located in the northern part of Asia, Europe, and North America. It
surrounds the Arctic Ocean, which is an ocean covered with ice. It is
the largest body of water in the Arctic; it is the smallest and
shallowest ocean in the world. When evaluated according to its
geographical integrity, its social and cultural integrity, the land and
sea areas spread within the borders of the Arctic States. Of these, the
Arctic and open seas are exceptional areas, and there are also areas of
conflict and problems (Barents Sea, Lomonosov Ridge, Sea Passageways,
etc.). Although it is valid for the whole world\'s geography,
technological advances in the context of the Arctic increase the
importance of the field, even if it reduces its impact. [The Arctic acts
as a strategic bridge between North America and Eurasia]{.underline}.
This location facilitates access to sea routes and natural resources,
thus attracting the attention of great powers.

[Global climate change]{.underline}, due to the melting of Arctic
glaciers, [has transformed the region from one of its primary scientific
interests into a competitive one for commercial, national security, and
environmental concerns.]{.underline} The new geopolitical situation that
will emerge as a result of the melting of the glaciers causes the region
to be at the center of international politics due to its potential
economic and political effects. [The importance of the Arctic, which is
becoming increasingly accessible as the ice melts as a result of rising
global temperatures, should not be underestimate]{.underline}d. It seems
inevitable that the region will be at the center of activities such as
discovering gold and other precious metals, commercial shipping,
tourism, and oil and gas exploration due to its changing structure.
[Apart from the natural cycle and natural changes of the Earth, it is
understood that human activities that disrupt the atmosphere composition
also cause climate change, and the increase in Earth temperatures due to
global climate change]{.underline} affects the ocean circulation and the
global climate system. Two of the most affected by this; It is the
Beaufort Cycle and the Transpolar Current which have a significant
impact on the circulation of surface water and sea ice in the Arctic
Ocean. [It is estimated that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet
alone could cause the global sea-level rise by about seven meters.
Developments in the Arctic due to global climate change, in addition to
its role in global sea-level rise and greenhouse gas emissions, also
affect weather patterns in lower latitudes around the worl]{.underline}d
(Limon, 2020: 728). It is the author\'s thesis that the Arctic meltdown
has and [will continue to pose economic, military, and environmental
challenges to the management of the region and that technological
factors will likely be a barrier and facilitator for access in the short
term]{.underline}. Declining sea ice offers greater long-term
opportunities for countries to build infrastructure to exploit
hydrocarbons and minerals and provide greater access to commercial
shipping and fishing.

### Securitization good 

#### Turn---climate securitization can be a useful tool for transformative democracy---stressing urgency is necessary

**Albert,** University of London, Lecturer in International Relations,
**2023**

(Michael, "Climate emergency and securitization politics: towards a
climate politics of the extraordinary," GLOBALIZATIONS, 2023, VOL. 20,
NO. 4, 533--547,
[[https://doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2022.2117501]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2022.2117501)
HDCSW-TM)

Michael Williams suggests that [by rethinking securitization theory
through the lens of extraordi- nary politics, it is possible to develop
a more positive understanding of securitization as 'a process of
openness and self-determination with democratic potential']{.underline}
that may enable 'a more founda- tional -- if always fraught --
revaluation of the political order itself in ways that can be inclusive
and reformative as well as violently exclusionary' (2015, p. 115). In
other words, from this view, [there is no inevitability that emergency
claims (if accepted) lead to suppression of democracy and exclusionary
injustice]{.underline}, though this is always a danger. Instead,
[enunciations of security or declarations of emergency from grassroots
movements may be viewed as expressions of latent con- stituent
power]{.underline} that also have democratizing potential. As Ben
Anderson shows, [both climate and racial justice movements use emergency
declarations as 'a pragmatic-contextual intervention in the present that
aims precisely to disrupt what has already become normal',]{.underline}
or to fold 'a sense emer- gency into the mode of operation of the very
systems and infrastructures that, for some, once pro- duced a sense of
stability' (2017, p. 473, 472). In this way [they aim to generate
urgency among otherwise complacent publics, erode the legitimacy of
constituted political regimes, inspire hope that rapid transformative
action can stave off the emergency and create a better future, and call
forth 'self-organized insurgent publics' capable of realizing this
alternative future]{.underline} (Anderson, 2017, pp. 469--470; Kalyvas,
2008, p. 13).

[The strategy of Extinction Rebellion can usefully be read in this way.
Their key demands]{.underline} -- for- cing governments to 'tell the
truth' about the climate emergency, bring emissions to zero within a
decade, and create 'citizen's assemblies' to democratically determine
how societies decarbonize -- [aim to disrupt and transform dominant
cognitive--affective dispositions by highlighting the unsus- tainability
of business-as-usual, the criminal negligence of existing governments
vis-à-vis the cli- mate emergency, and the necessity of decisive
emergency action.]{.underline} Like earlier forms of civil disobedience,
their disruptive actions 'target directly the existing symbolic and
juridical structures of instituted power' in order to rearticulate the
'illegal' as 'extra-legal', or subject to a 'higher law' or rationality
beyond the arbitrariness of instituted state authority (Kalyvas, 2008,
p. 299). Further- more, by calling for citizen's assemblies they
explicitly aim to supplement institutionalized demo- cratic
decision-making with 'extraconstitutional forms of participation that
strive to narrow the distance between rulers and ruled, active and
passive citizens, representatives and represented' (7).

But of course there is no guarantee that grassroots climate emergency
strategies will result in the desired outcome: target audiences may
remain unpersuaded by the urgency of the crisis and/or the need for
emergency action beyond current policies, and dominant interests and
their media mouth- pieces may effectively write them off as
'eco-extremists' or 'millenarian cultists' (the common dis- cursive
strategy employed by rightwing UK media outlets). On the other hand, [in
conditions of worsening climate shocks and deepening political-economic
crises, climate emergency movements may indeed help trigger 'social
tipping points' in which the need for emergency action rapidly becomes
popular common sense]{.underline} (Otto et al., 2020), though the
outcome may be eco-authoritarian securitization more than climate
justice (as I'll elaborate below). [Critics of climate emergency strat-
egies]{.underline} are thus not wrong when they highlight the risks of
such strategies. They **[are simply one-sided, ignoring or downplaying
their democratic and constituent potential.]{.underline}**

A growing need for societally relevant research in [the
Arctic]{.underline} has risen as global attention has turned to the
Arctic, which [is warming]{.underline} nearly [four times faster than
any other region in the world2]{.underline}. [This causes harmful
effects on Arctic residents']{.underline} everyday [lives, cultures,
well-being, economies and infrastructures]{.underline}, just to mention
a few. As the slogan states, "[What happens in the Arctic, doesn't stay
in the Arctic]{.underline}", [the climate change in the Arctic creates
**global socio- economic impacts** and changes in processes which are
important for **global climate** and **sea level**]{.underline}3. [These
are]{.underline} most [strikingly witnessed as **extreme weather
events**]{.underline}. At the same time, the Arctic has become
attractive for new opportunities for economic growth, e.g., the use of
its natural resources and the building and investment in green energy
transition.

All [these]{.underline} [have increased the need for **stakeholder
dialogue**, **engagement**, or **consultations**,]{.underline} depending
on the context. There are over seven million people living in the Arctic
region, and approximately one million people, [9% of the total
population of the Arctic region, are Indigenous]{.underline},
representing over 40 different ethnic groups4. The United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/RES/61/295) adopted
on 13 September 2007, defines Indigenous rights as follows: 1.
Indigenous Peoples have the right to the lands, territories, and
resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise
used or acquired. 2. Indigenous Peoples have the right to own, use,
develop and con- trol the lands, territories, and resources that they
possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional
occupation or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired5.
Therefore, in this chapter [Indigenous communities are defined as rights
holders]{.underline}.

The European Union (EU) identified the key societal challenges in its
H2020 framework programme, which was a starting point for extensive
stakeholder dialogue with the aim of conducting societ- ally relevant
research6. This was the basis for EU-PolarNet, an EU Coordination and
Support Action project funded for two periods (2015--2020 and
2020--2024). The Stakeholder Engagement Work Package 2 of the
EU-PolarNet project is the basis for this chapter. Table 11.1 provides a
summary of EU-PolarNet project activities conducted by the Stakeholder
Engagement Work Package.

In particular, this chapter discusses Arctic stakeholder and rights
holder engagement in research and economic development projects.
Indigenous communities are acknowledged as rights holders and because
best practices and guidelines for ethically sound research created by
several Northern communities including the Inuit Circumpolar Council,
The Saami Council and the Alaska Native Knowledge Network, among others,
are available online, this chapter is not duplicating their effort but
acknowledges them as best resources and sources of knowledge. In
addition to this, useful open resources with a compilation of resources,
recommendations, and best practices from a variety of Northern
organizations can be found on the Arctic Research of the United States
(ARCUS) web- site. A "Roadmap to decolonial Arctic research" has been
recently released: It is a comprehensive policy brief communicated to
the EU Commission and contains 32 recommendations for actions and best
practice examples with the aim to anchor decolonial research in the
Arctic. This was co-created by the Saami Council together with several
partners, and the process also included two dialogues with the European
Commission7. This Roadmap provides the needed guidance for Arctic
researchers and funders.

How to Engage With Stakeholders and Rights Holders in Research

[Arctic research has expanded]{.underline} during the recent years
resulting in a 22% increase in Arctic research publications during
2016-- 2021 8. [This has increased requests and needs for stakeholder
and rights holder engagement and dialogue with the aim to, first,
**fulfil funding agencies\' criteria** for **societally relevant
research** and, sec- ondly, to move towards **co-produced
transdisciplinary research**]{.underline}. [By engaging in these
activities, research can be more **representative** of stakeholder's
interests and knowledges, and more **impacting** in terms of academic
records]{.underline}9.

[Non-academic participants can bring multiple **knowledges** and
**expertise**, which are **vital** to research and give **flexibility**
on the idea of how research should be framed, conducted and become
successful]{.underline}10. But [this entails, creating an environment of
**joint leadership**, **shared rights** and **obligations** from the
onset of the project]{.underline}11. [Research expectations must be
agreed upon and managed through the project's lifetime in an on-going
open and respectful dialogue.]{.underline} [This is vital for building
**trust**]{.underline} when crossing professional cultural boundaries,
[because this entails stakeholders and rights holders opening them-
selves to vulnerability and risks]{.underline}. Harris and Lyon12 write
that "trust is shown to be built by having information on others, prior
experience of working together, norms of cooperation, and sanctions
exerted on those who might transgress norms of behaviour".

[**Our sovereignty is embodied, it is ontological** (our being) **and
epistemological** (our way of knowing), and it is grounded in complex
relations derived from the inter-substantiation of ancestral beings,
humans and land. In this sense, our **sovereignty is carried by the body
and differs from western constructions of sovereignty**, which are
predicated on the social contract model, the idea of a unified supreme
authority, territorial integrity and individual rights.]{.underline}
(Moreton-Robinson, Citation2007, p. 2)

[**Settler colonialism is rooted in white supremacy and aims to '"tame"
a variety of wildernesses**, end up establishing independent nations,
effectively repress, co-opt, and extinguish Indigenous alterities, and
\[productively\] manage ethnic diversity']{.underline} (Veracini,
Citation2011). Colonialism involves one nation subjugating another,
controlling and exploiting its people and resources. [Colonisers
commonly **force their own language(s), culture, values and beliefs on
the people** they control and actively **exclude Indigenous peoples from
academic institutions** and effectively attempt to **sideline Indigenous
knowledges**]{.underline}. By 1914, most of the world\'s nations had
been colonised by Europeans at some point, using power and influence to
control (Abernethy, Citation2000; Lloyd & Metzer, Citation2013;
Wesseling, Citation2015). Non-white and non-Euro-western knowledges have
been subsequently positioned as inferior and 'othered' within the
colonial racialised hierarchical ways of knowing and knowledges
(Valverde, Citation2005). [When Euro-western values and practices are
baked into colonial laws, regulations, political decisions and
institutional governance systems, people who do not conform to the same
values and practices are often discriminated against and
excluded.]{.underline} Such everyday racism and segregation of people by
race and culture often go unnoticed and unmentioned by groups who are
not subject to racism, such is the [**pervasiveness of whiteness** and
the role it plays in **determining what knowledges and practices are
valued**]{.underline} (Maddox, Kennedy, Waa, et al., Citation2022;
Robertson, Citation2015; Ward et al., Citation2021). The colonial
hierarchy of knowledge systems has resulted in daily experiences of
wide-ranging structural and systemic forms of discrimination, racism and
exclusion through colonisation and racialised capitalism (Anderson et
al., Citation2016; Gracey & King, Citation2009; King et al.,
Citation2009; Morton Ninomiya et al., Citation2023). While this
commentary may resonate with diverse geographies, colonial histories,
power and control differentials, we recognise and respect the great
diversity among Indigenous peoples, including diversity in experiences
of colonisation and coloniality.

Our commentary [calls for epistemic justice. **By epistemic justice, we
refer to how epistemologies** (how knowledge(s) is/are constructed) that
are **frequently devalued or ignored must be treated, recognised and
valued** -- with careful consideration of identity and power within
their contexts. We draw attention to how systems privilege some
knowledges while **silencing, delegitimising and devaluing differing
knowers** and ways of knowing, being and doing]{.underline} (Fricker,
Citation2017). Before discussing epistemic justice, we see value in
truth telling. This paper is structured to name and highlight examples
of truths that are commonly hidden in plain sight, predominately to
people in power, and then draw attention to epistemic justice in public
health research and practice globally.

Truth telling

We highlight two truths that are commonly hidden in plain sight. First,
[knowledge systems that drive educational systems, research, practices,
decisions and outcomes are **predominantly Euro-western oriented**. As a
result, they are systematically and actively biased, reinforcing
white-dominant perspectives through **inherently racist epistemological
processes** of whitewashing -- the deliberate or unintentional erasure,
modification or minimisation of non-Euro-Western perspectives,
contributions and knowledges. This process is harmful because it
**systematically devalues ways of knowing**, actively silences voices
and reinforces dominant narratives that privilege Euro-Western
views.]{.underline} [The **result is a distortion of history,
knowledges** and research impacts decision-making and outcomes,
particularly for Indigenous and other structurally and systemically
oppressed peoples and communities]{.underline} (Lee et al.,
Citation2023). Second, [scientific research and researchers tout using
principles of openness, collaboration and transparency and yet continue
to draw on inherently racist epistemological processes and racialised
logic that inherently perpetuate and embed racism, inherently silencing
and undermining Indigenous knowledge systems and knowledges]{.underline}
(Miller, Citation2022). While our commentary is framed around
sovereignty amid structural and systemic racism, colonisation and the
exclusion of Indigenous peoples, we know that much of our position also
applies to hetero- and gender-normative, ableist, ageist and a plethora
of interlocking systems of power, control and oppression. The following
words from Dr Rhys Jones' at the 2022 PRIDOC conference resonate with
us: '[We cannot pick our oppressor. **We must be antiracist, antisexist,
antiablist, antiageist, antioppresive**]{.underline} ... '. Examples of
how knowledge systems are Euro-western oriented and whitewashed can be
found in questioning whose knowledge(s) are (de)valued and numerous
related questions (Box 2). We suggest truth telling includes drawing
attention to answers from the following questions.

[[Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing are based on embodied
sovereignty, relationality and countless generations of knowledge
sharing.]{.mark} We **[call for epistemic justice in which Indigenous
knowledge systems are recognised and valued]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
research-related contexts. We draw attention to how [[colonial knowledge
systems **silence, delegitimise and devalue specific knowers and ways of
knowing, being and doing** -- through truth
telling]{.mark}.]{.underline} This includes (1) the extent to which
educational systems, research, practices, decisions, and reported
outcomes are whitewashed -- [a process of structural and systemic
discrimination, racism, and exclusion]{.underline} that actively alters
or omits Indigenous and non-Euro-Western contributions and perspectives
to fit Euro-Western norms and (2) whitewashed and racialised logic in
scientific research [that]{.underline} claims to be open, collaborative
and transparent. Whitewashing not only [[obscures the history and
contributions of Indigenous peoples and communities but also actively
reinforces systemic biases and inequities.]{.mark} We assert the need
for epistemic justice in public health research. [**Epistemic justice
calls for Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination** to be made
visible. It may involve on how colonial policies, protocols, and
regulations are connected to everyday lived inequities of Indigenous
communities, families and individuals. Ultimately, epistemic justice is
inherent to Indigenous peoples' health and wellness, self-determination
and sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Colonial context: Epistemic justice

Indigenous peoples are diverse and are made up of many nations,
languages, political systems, knowledges, experiences, practices,
relationships and [[myriad forms of resistance to
colonisation]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These relationships commonly include
connections to the land, waters, air, ice and traditional medicines,
such as the sacred tobacco plant. [**Indigenous ways of knowing, being
and doing have existed for thousands of years**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[They are based on sovereignty and countless generations of
observations, experiences, growing knowledges and sharing
information]{.mark} (Box 1). [These knowledges are intimately connected
to relationality]{.mark}. It is important to recognise relationality and
our credentials. These are founded in our respective relational roles,
community accountability and responsibilities as well as acknowledging
our connections, biases and worldviews. [Relationality is a distinct
Indigenous social research presupposition and forms the epistemic
'scaffolding' shaping and supporting the possibility for coming to know
and generating knowledge(s) in respective times, spaces and
places]{.mark} (Moreton-Robinson, Citation2017, p. 69).]{.underline} The
successes of careful and valuable research, evaluation and knowledge
generation are evidenced through survival and adaptions to everchanging
environments, including colonialism, programmes and policies embedded to
actively eradicate Indigenous people and communities, as well as the
active silencing and attempted control around relationality.

#### The aff's recognition of indigenous knowledge related to development ensures research that shifts the gaze from Indigenous peoples to colonial systems

Epistemic justice in public health research

Settler colonisation, which inherently includes Indigenous-specific
racism, is well established as a root cause of negative health and
wellbeing within Indigenous populations (Greenwood et al., Citation2015;
King et al., Citation2009, p. 1--2; Paradies, Citation2016). **[In
communities where Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination are
realised, so too is health and wellbeing]{.underline}** (Joseph,
Citation2024). The UNDRIP (United Nations General Assembly,
Citation2007), Uluru Statement from the Heart (Referendum Council,
Citation2017), Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Citation2015), Close
the Gap (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Citation2020),
Reconciliation Australia (Reconciliation Australia, Citationn.d.),
national research councils (Government of Canada, Citation2014; National
Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Citation2023) and local
councils assert that improving Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes
is everyone's business. In other words, [if researchers are not
improving Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes through research and
evaluation, chances are that they will exacerbate
inequities]{.underline}. [When [']{.mark}one-size-fits-all' research,
policies and protocols are applied, systemic and structural inequities
are unaccounted for and often exacerbate health inequities]{.underline}
(Delaney et al., Citation2021). **[Researchers and evaluators must
consider the health and wellbeing needs of Indigenous peoples, and the
contexts in which they operate.]{.underline}**

**[Epistemic justice requires honouring Indigenous peoples' sovereignty
and self-determination]{.underline}**

[Epistemic justice will improve Indigenous health and wellbeing
outcomes]{.underline}. In fact, [epistemic justice has improved
Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes]{.underline}. There is an
ever-growing body of research and practice demonstrating epistemic
justice in Indigenous public health research and practice, as is
featured in this special issue. In a current realist review study
(Hunter Porter et al., Citation2024) [focussed on Indigenous knowledges
centred in research, we are finding that few publications report on the
(1) extent to which Indigenous community members are involved in all
phases of research, (2) research outcomes and benefits for the
community, (3) involvement of community members in writing the paper and
(4) relationship of the authors to the Indigenous
community(ies).]{.underline}

[It is possible that more Indigenous communities will engage in research
that 'studies up' -- research that shifts the gaze from Indigenous
peoples to the contemporary colonial structures and systems that support
and maintain the conditions for health and wellbeing inequities and
inequalities]{.underline}. Researchers and scholars have drawn attention
to examples and the need for more empirical research that makes visible
the insidious nature of current structural racism and its direct impacts
on health (Jongbloed et al., Citation2023; Ray et al., Citation2022;
Wispelwey et al., Citation2023). Research methods like institutional
ethnography have shown how polices, protocols, regulations, processes
and environments are directly linked to peoples' daily activities,
including driving health inequities and inequalities (Balcom et al.,
Citation2021; Morton Ninomiya et al., Citation2018). By studying
colonial systems and institutions in relation to the everyday lived
experiences of Indigenous peoples and communities, researchers may be
required to 'bite the hand that feeds them' to address inequities and
inequalities, upholding ethical practice. Studying up requires research
applicants and funders alike to ask questions such as: what will it take
for funding bodies to support this kind of research? Does this research
come at an expense we are willing to make? Who is willing to take the
risk of biting the hand that feeds their programme of research? Imagine
studying the protocols and practices of organisations/institutions that
fund research with Indigenous communities and groups and journals that
publish research papers on Indigenous research. We need to consider who
is most appropriate and qualified to adjudicate proposals and papers?

Championing antiracist work across society, [within the academy, and
throughout health systems requires including and respecting Indigenous
knowledges, cultures and ways of knowing, being and doing. In return,
health and wellbeing outcomes will undoubtedly improve among Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} and non-Indigenous peoples. We need to better
understand and make visible the connections and complexities within
systems, rather than accept or adopt simple cause-and-effect approaches
and explanations. [It is important that colonial systems recognise and
authentically respect Indigenous values, knowledges and cultures, using
an actively antiracist approach]{.underline}. [Understanding the ongoing
impacts of colonisation and racist policies, including truth telling,
can help improve policy, practice and ultimately health and wellbeing
outcomes. By practicing and championing epistemic justice, researchers,
health practitioners and systems at large can help to reverse centuries
of exclusion, racism, inequities and inequalities that Indigenous
peoples continue to face today.]{.underline}

[A key point in this literature is that]{.underline} [political autonomy
can take many different forms.]{.underline} At the one extreme, it can
be derivative from the constitutional structures of the state of which
it is part such as unitary and federal states. [At the other extreme,
the autonomy can be non-territorially based, and thus not tied to the
state structures in a simple way. This can be due to the dispersion of
the Indigenous populations concerned on the territory of the
state.]{.underline} Hybrids between the two, or political autonomy which
is only partially derivative of state structures, are also possible. In
addition, [the institutional outcomes are also shaped by whether
self-government arrangements are a response to aspirations for future
independence or rather to Indigenous demands for more control in
particular (functional) areas. Second, there is the literature on
Indigenous political governance. The focus here is on how Indigenous
people are enacting political agency rather than being passive receivers
of political decisions from the dominant state elites.]{.underline}

This literature sees [the interaction between Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} and the states as dynamic and ongoing; Indigenous
people [are not on verge of disappearing from the political stage but
rather engaged in a politics of 'Survivance' (native presence and
actuality), which should be recognised within political
science.]{.underline} Moreover, [although Indigenous people seek
equality, their aims, unlike other ethnic groups, often include some
kind of 'sovereign' government within their existing. Even if the
empowerment of Indigenous peoples through the UNDRIP and ILO conventions
is important, the concrete establishment of Indigenous autonomy comes
out of the inter-action within the states structures of which they are
part.]{.underline} [An]{.underline} HI ([historical
institutionalism]{.underline}) [framework provides concepts to address
the importance of this context, central historical events, goal-seeking
political actors and their identity.]{.underline} [In addition, the
application of HI allows an integration of the agency of Indigenous
peoples into theoretical approaches where this has previously been
absent.]{.underline}

[The Arctic region, or the Arctic, **is a geographic region spreading
around the North Pole. There is no single correct definition of the
region as the southern boundary varies.**]{.underline}

Key ways to define the Arctic:

The Arctic Circle (66 ° 33\'N) delimits the Arctic in terms of solar
radiation. In theory, areas north of the Arctic Circle have at least one
day without daylight in the winter and at least one nightless night in
the summer. In practice, this does not happen everywhere because the
surface of the earth is uneven, and the light refracts in the
atmosphere.

Based on temperature, the monthly average temperature in the Arctic is
below + 10 ° C throughout the year, even in summer.

The forest line follows a temperature-defined area. The forest line is
not a narrow line but a zone tens of kilometres wide between the
northern coniferous forest and the tundra. In this demarcation, the
Arctic is predominantly wooded tundra and glaciers.

Permafrost increases the area of Russian Arctic compared to the other
delimitations. Permafrost is soil that stays frozen for at least two
consecutive years.

[The ice cover determines the Arctic nature of marine areas. Sea ice is
highest in February-March and lowest in September. The surface of the
Arctic ice is monitored almost in real time by satellites. (see The
National Snow and Ice Data Centre)]{.underline}

[Culturally defined, the Arctic covers the homelands of northern
indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

[Political delimitations vary according to how they serve, for example,
the interests of states or international cooperation.]{.underline}

[As the climate warms, **the Arctic shrinks if defined by temperature,
forest line, permafrost, or ice cover.** **Cultural and political
boundaries also vary.** The Arctic Circle is the most permanent of the
delimitations, although also the polar circle moves very slowly due to
the variation of the Earth\'s axial tilt.]{.underline}

3.2 Analysis: identifying micropolitics

[In]{.underline} the [existing]{.underline} academic and government
[literature]{.underline}, [commonly proposed interventions]{.underline}
[to improve]{.underline} the delivery of [environmental
assistance]{.underline} are well-informed and urgent. But these
recommendations sometimes **[fall short]{.underline}** [of engaging the
more mundane and micropolitical barriers to effective collaboration with
Indigenous communities]{.underline}, such as Alaska Native villages.
[Issues that seem distant from federal offices]{.underline} in
Washington, DC, [can pose significant challenges in rural
Alaska.]{.underline} These include, for example, intermittent Internet
access, English spoken as a second language, misaligned expectations
around trust and relationship-building (Whyte 2020), and the need to
spend days to weeks at a time away from village centers to fish and hunt
(Marino 2015). [**Effectively assisting** with environmental
adaptation---and indeed, any issue---in rural Alaska requires attending
to these **place-based** and **culturally-specific dimensions**, and the
**micropolitics** that arise between them]{.underline}.

A list of micropolitical barriers, with examples and exceptions, is
presented in Table 1. Neither the list, nor the exceptions, are
exhaustive. Table 2 presents a list of non-micropolitical barriers ---
also non-exhaustively.

[Alaska Native villages face micropolitical barriers to successfully
engaging federal programs even when those programs]{.underline} (e.g.,
those within the Bureau of Indian Affairs) [are specifically designed to
render aid to Indigenous communities.]{.underline} Often, [these
barriers are technological, cultural, or pragmatic in ways that are not
legible]{.underline} (Scott 2008) [to agency staff in cities in the
Lower 48]{.underline}. [These barriers are micropolitical because they
are **not readily visible** to policymakers but nevertheless pose
**major challenges** in the practice of policy execution and service
delivery.]{.underline}

In this case, [micropolitics is about the conduct of government rather
than its overarching goals]{.underline}. As such, [they are easily
overlooked or]{.underline} even [ignored]{.underline} by high-level
officials in Congress and the agencies tasked with delivering services.
Nevertheless, [they underlie the conditions for success or failure in
many communities, as was the case following Typhoon Merbok.]{.underline}

[Conclusions]{.mark}

[[The strength of the Arctic Council is in its structure,]{.underline}
and in the fact that the consensus principle [between the eight Arctic
States]{.underline} prevails at all levels in this structure.
[Involvement of the Indigenous peoples is also of major importance in
shaping decisions in the Arctic Council.]{.underline} It is of great
significance for [the Council's research that the results and findings
that emerge from its work are discussed by officials and policy makers
at the highest levels]{.underline}. Experience has shown that when
experts and [scientists from the Arctic States agree on results and
proposed recommendations]{.underline}, they are in general [approved by
the Ministers and therefore very likely to be followed up by the Arctic
States.]{.underline} ]{.mark}

[[In shaping effective policy measures, the consensus principle in this
structure should therefore be seen as a strength, rather than a
weakness. The fact that Ministers are greatly involved in shaping the
Council's research has also helped to make the work of the Arctic
Council more meaningful and more prominent in discussions in other
international organizations.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[Discourses that predict the]{.mark} imminent '[end of the world' are
not]{.mark} as [universal]{.mark} as they often claim to
be.]{.underline}** [[The futures they fear for]{.mark}, seek to protect
[and]{.mark} work to [construct are rooted]{.mark} in]{.underline} a
particular set of global social structures and subjectivities:
[[whiteness]{.mark}. Whiteness]{.underline} is not reducible to skin
pigmentation, genetics or genealogy. It [is a set of cultural,
political, economic, normative, and subjective structures derived from
Euro- centric societies and propagated through global formations such as
colonization and capitalism. These [multi-scalar structures work by
segregating bodies through the inscription of racial difference,]{.mark}
privileging those they recognize or construct as 'white'4 and unequally
distributing harms to those that they do not.]{.underline}5 Whiteness is
also a form of property6 that accrues benefits -- including material,
physical, and other forms of secu- rity -- and pervasive forms of power,
across space, time, and social structures. Due in part to its
trans-formation through long-duration, global patterns of violence and
con- quest, [whiteness takes unique forms wherever and whenever it
coalesces, so it should not be treated as universal -- despite its own
internal claims to this status. Most of the leading contributors to
mainstream ['end of the world' discourses]{.mark} discussed in this
arti- cle [are rooted in Euro-American cultural contexts]{.mark}, and in
particular in settler colonial and/or imperial states]{.underline} such
as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. As
such, **[the forms of whiteness they embody are [linked to]{.mark}
particular histo- ries of [settlement]{.mark}, frontier cultures,
resource-based [imperialisms, genocides of Indigenous communities,
histories of slavery, and modes of
anti-Blackness.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Whiteness is remarkable in its ability to render itself invisible to
those who possess and benefit from it. [Many, if not most, of the (often
liberal humanitarian) authors of 'end of the world' discourses seem
unaware of its integral influence on their thinking]{.underline}, and
would almost certainly be horrified at the thought of their work
entrenching racialized injustices. We are not suggesting that these
authors espouse explicit, intentional and/or extreme rac- ist ideals, on
which much public discussion by white people of racism tends to focus.7
Nor do we wish to homogenize or present as equivalent all of the
viewpoints discussed in this paper, which display a range of expressions
of whiteness and levels of awareness thereof.8 On the contrary, [we work
to center broad, everyday, structural ways in which underlying logics of
[whiteness and white supremacy frame and permeate mainstream paradigms
and discourses, including those identified as liberal, humanitarian, or
progressive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even amongst white people who
consciously and explicitly disavow racism, [unconscious, habitual,
normalized, structurally-embedded assumptions circulate, and are
reproduced in ways that perpetuate race9 as a global power
structure.]{.underline} This includes one of the authors of this paper
(Mitchell), who, as a white settler,10 continues to benefit from and
participate -- and thus 'invest'11 -- in structures of whiteness, and
therefore has a continual responsibil- ity to confront them (although
total divestment is not possible).12

The 'habits' of racism13 are reflected strongly in the way that
contemporary 'end of the world' narratives frame their protagonists:
those attributed with meaningful agency and ethical status in the face
of global threats; those whose survival or flourishing is prioritized or
treated as a bottom line when tradeoffs are imagined and planned; and,
crucially, those deemed capable of and entitled to 'save the world' and
determine its future. This is expressed in several key features of the
genre, including its domination by white thinkers; the forms of
subjectivity and agency it embraces; and the ways it con- trasts its
subjects against BIPOC communities.

First, [contributors to fast-growing fields like the study of
'existential risk' or 'global catastrophic risk' are overwhelmingly
white]{.underline}. As we will see, almost all of the authors identified
by the literature review on which this paper is based, and certainly the
most influential thinkers in the field, are white. For example, [[the
seminal collection Global Existential]{.mark} Risk]{.underline},14 which
claims to offer a comprehensive snapshot of this field, [is [edited by
two white male Europeans]{.mark} (Nick Bostrom and Milan Circovic) [and
authored by an almost entirely white (and all-male) group of
scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}. Likewise, [the most senior positions
within influential think tanks promoting the study of 'existential
risk', such as the Future of Humanity Institute, the Cambridge Center
for the Study of Existential Risk and Humanprogress.org, are dominated
by white men, with few exceptions]{.underline}.15 Another expression of
this tendency toward epistemic whiteness is found in the habit,
prominent amongst white academics, of citing all or mostly-white
scholars, which entrenches a politics of citation16 that privileges
whiteness and acknowledges only some intersectionalities as relevant.17
As mentioned above, Mitchell's (2017)18 work offers an example of this
tendency: while it engages critical, feminist, and queer post-
apocalyptic visions written by white authors, it does not center BIPOC
perspectives or knowledge systems.

These examples do not simply raise issues of numerical representation,
nor can white- ness necessarily be dismantled simply by altering these
ratios. More importantly, [[all-white or majority white spaces]{.mark}
create epistemes in which most contributors share cultural back-
grounds, assumptions, and biases that [are rarely challenged by
alternative worldviews, knowledge systems or registers of
experience]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such epistemes the perceived
boundaries of 'human thought' are often elided with those of
Euro-centric knowledge. For example, influential American settler
journalist David Wallace-Wells19 contends that there exists no framework
for grasping climate change besides 'mythology and theology'. In so
doing, he ignores centuries of ongoing, systematic observation and
explicit articulations of concern by BIPOC knowledge keepers about
climactic change. [[The bracketing of BIPOC knowl- edges]{.mark} not
only severely limits the rigor of discourses on global crises, but also,
as bi-racial organizer and thinker adrienne maree brown20 argues, **it
[produces distorted outcomes]{.mark}**. For instance, it smuggles
normative judgments that 'turn Brown bombers into terrorists and white
bombers into mentally ill victims' into apparently 'objective'
claims]{.underline}. Similarly, the influential work of Black American
criminologist Ruth Wilson Gilmore21 demonstrates how white imaginaries
of the threat posed by BIPOC bodies has produced the massive global
penal complex and the radically unequal distribution of life chances. In
short, **[[imagi- naries create worlds, so it matters greatly whose are
privileged, and whose are excluded.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Further, [emerging narratives of the 'end of the world' explicitly
center figures of whiteness as their protagonists -- as the survivors of
apocalypse, the subjects capable of saving the world from it, and as
those most threatened]{.underline}. In these discourses, ['survivors'
are framed as saviors able to protect and/or regenerate and even improve
Western forms of governance and social order by leveraging resilience,
scientific prowess, and techno- logical genius.]{.underline} For
example, the cover of American settler scientists Tony Barnosky and
Elizabeth Hadley's book Tipping Points for Planet Earth features a
stylized male 'human' whom they identify as former California governor
Jerry Brown (a powerful white settler politician) holding the earth back
from rolling over a cliff.22 Similarly, presenting a thought experiment
about the planet's future, Homer-Dixon23 asks his readers to imagine 'an
average male -- call him John' (in fact, the most popular male name
globally at the time of writing was Mohammed). This is followed by
images of a Caucasian male dressed in safari or hiking gear -- both
emblematic of symbols colonial conquest24 -- tasked with choosing from
two forks on a path, as imagined by white American poet Robert Frost.
This image of rugged masculine whiteness, embodied in physical strength,
colonial prowess, and the ability to dominate difficult landscapes is
mirrored in his framing of his former co-workers on oil rigs in the
Canadian prairies25 as models of resilience. Similarly, American settler
science writer Annalee Newitz26 proposes the Canadian province of
Saskatchewan as a 'model for human survival', based on her perceptions
of the resilience, persistence and collaborative frontier atti- tudes of
its people. Saskatchewan is a notoriously racist part of Canada, in
which vio- lence against Indigenous people continues to be integral to
its white-dominated culture27 -- yet this polity and its culture are
held up by Newitz as a model of 'human' resilience. [By imagining
subjects in whom whiteness is elided with resilience and survival,
[these discourses not only normalize and obscure the modes of violence
and oppression through which perceived 'resilience']{.mark} -- or, in
blunt terms, preferential access to survival -- [is achieved. They also
work to displace the threat of total destruction 'onto others who are
seen as lacking the resourcefulness of the
survivor']{.mark}]{.underline}.28

2\. The Mi'kmaw principle of Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing) as a means to
appeal to the best of both Western laws and Indigenous laws in economic
development

Historically, [the privileging of [Western laws in Indigenous]{.mark}
economic [development]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [has had deleterious
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} [on Indigenous economies because Indigenous
laws have gone **unrecognized**.]{.underline} Yet [[bringing together
the **best of both Western and Indigenous legal orders**]{.mark} in
economic development processes [could]{.mark} be a means to [provide a
more **equitable** basis]{.mark} from which [to promote Indigenous
**self-determination**, **community** **engagement**,
**empowerment**,]{.mark} and [**capacity** **building**]{.mark},85 [and
respect for Indigenous **sovereignty**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
[Mi'kmaw principle]{.mark} of Etuaptmumk (**[Two- Eyed Seeing]{.mark}**)
is a useful principle that [encourages **diverse ways** of knowing to
work together]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is based on the premise that [to
"see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways
of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of Western
knowledges...and \[learning to use\] both these eyes together, for the
benefit of all]{.underline}"86 [is [a more **equitable** way to view and
experience shared]{.mark} [spaces]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [the
existence of two separate social systems]{.underline} (based in values,
legal orders, and economic theories) [means Two-Eyed Seeing can be
explored, discussed, and positioned as a **reconciliation framework**
for more **ethical** or **just** legal and economic
development.]{.underline}

Elder Marshall notes that [the principle can apply in a range of
circumstances and in many areas of society]{.underline}:

[Two-Eyed Seeing]{.underline}...does not fit into any particular subject
area or discipline. Rather, it [is about life]{.underline}: [what you
do, what kind of responsibilities you have, how you should live while on
earth]{.underline}...[i.e., a guiding principle that covers all aspects
of our lives: social, economic, environmental, etc.]{.underline} **[[The
advantage of Two-Eyed Seeing is that you are always fine tuning your
mind into different places at once]{.mark}, you are [always looking for
another perspective and better way of doing
things]{.mark}]{.underline}**.87

While Two-Eyed Seeing is helpful beyond the law, this article focuses on
the law to challenge legal actors to embrace the strengths of Indigenous
laws and ways of knowing in combination with the strengths of Western
laws and ways of knowing. As such, [[Two-Eyed Seeing can
expand]{.underline}]{.mark} Canadian [[legal orders to recognize and
legitimize Indigenous legal orders]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [what
"Two-Eyed Seeing" can bring to the "economic table" is that Indigenous
legal orders [not only]{.mark} have the capacity to [shape **legal
pluralism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Canada [[but]{.mark} can [shape
Indigenous]{.mark} economic [development]{.mark} in a way [that supports
Indigenous self-determination.]{.mark}]{.underline} To do this, [an
**interdependent relationship** must be established where parties are
willing to engage in a co-learning journey.]{.underline}88 This is
distinguished from the ways that Indigenous laws have been treated as
inferior to Canadian laws, rather than as laws that all parties can
learn from on a co-learning journey between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous legal actors.

[[Engaging with different legal perspectives]{.mark}---which contain
both similarities and differences---[is a more inclusive way to
formulate complete legal principles in a given
area]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, Two-Eyed Seeing can be useful
to promote diversity in the area of trust law. Indigenous trusts have
become an increasingly common means for Indigenous communities to
advance economic development. Under Canadian law, trustees have a
fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries in
carrying out their duties in relation to the assets of the trust.
Likewise, Indigenous peoples across Canadaincluding the Nisga'a,
Gitxsan and Gitanyow, Cree, Anishinaabe, Nlaka'Pamux, Kwanlin Dün, and
Mi'kmaqhold distinct legal orders that set out the multi-faceted
responsibilities and obligations for managing wealth and resources.89

[Decolonial theory, like CRT, foregrounds the need to make intellectual
property's racial politics visible and confronts the exclusionary
effects of in- clusionary politics]{.underline}, through histories of
modernity as well as the histories of Americanism and citizenship
highlighted in this book. For decolonial theorists such as Walter
Mignolo and Anibal Quijano, [the colonial is always already in
opposition with modernity, with the latter category associated with
universal norms of "development" and "progress."]{.underline}

[[Decolonial thought]{.mark}, accordingly, [breaks with]{.mark} the
fundamental ["myth of modernity," embracing]{.mark} instead practices of
["epistemic delinking"" from the binary of coloniality/modernity created
by the political]{.mark} and economic systems]{.underline} that
originated in Europe and spread to the colonies. More spe- cifically,
["\[d\]e-coloniality turns the plate around and shifts the ethics and
politics of knowledge.]{.underline} Critical theories emerge from the
ruins of languages, categories of thoughts and subjectivities (Arab,
Aymara, Hindi, French and English Creole in the Caribbean, Afrikaans,
etc.) that had been consistently negated by the rhetoric of modernity
and in the imperial implementation of the logic of coloniality."8
[Through this emphasis on centering marginalized categories of thought,
[decoloniality provides a]{.mark} useful [theoretical frame for thinking
across racial and national identity categories,]{.mark} in ways that aid
in [undoing anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, and anti-Asianness, among
oth- ers]{.mark}.]{.underline} As José David Saldivar explains,
[[decolonial theory]{.mark} is a [useful]{.mark} tool [for thinking the
politics of "becoming minor," and]{.mark} the [epistemic marginal-
ization that accompanies them]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, Borrows notes that "despite recognition of the plurality of
legal orders in Canada, there is a paucity of research on the ways in
which various Indigenous legal orders intersect with fiduciary
duties."90 The result is that rather than learning from Indigenous
interpretations of law and managing resources, many trustees end up
equating the fiduciary duty with a responsibility to focus primarily on
fiscal returns. [This is not to say that the idea of profit is somehow
"outside" or anathema to Indigenous economic principles, but rather that
profit should not be the sole focus to the exclusion of other
values.]{.underline}

For example, [one of the legal principles that guide the Mi'kmaq is
Netukulimk, which confers the people with a responsibility to
**respect** and **steward** the **land** and **resources** with future
generations in mind.]{.underline} [The use of all that Creator has
provided is intended to support the economic well-being of individuals
and the community without endangering the integrity, diversity, or
productivity of the environment.]{.underline} [Profit should not be the
sole focus because the responsibility to use resources in a sustainable
way involves spiritual and traditional elements, as well as reciprocity,
all intended to connect the people, the flora, the fauna, and the
environment.]{.underline}91 Just as Western laws are established to
promote economic development, [Netukulimk promotes and sets the
**ecological limits** of economic development]{.underline}. In terms of
managing trust assets, combining the best of both Western and Indigenous
legal orders is a more holistic way to advance Indigenous economic
development in a good way.92

Certainly, [dealing with multiple legal orders within one broader area
of law will not be a simple or easy process.]{.underline} [In
applying]{.underline} what Elder Marshall believes is **[the spirit of
co-existence]{.underline}**,93 [a weaving back and forth between Western
laws and Indigenous laws in economic development ventures may be
required in some instances.]{.underline} To this end, [in advocating for
Indigenous legal engagement in economic development initiatives and
processes, it is clear many of these initiatives involve a market-based
accumulation of assets.]{.underline} [While there is no denying the
devastating impacts of capitalism, the **starting point** should be
where **Indigenous** **peoples** are positioned **today** and not where
they were before capitalism became pervasive.]{.underline} The reality
is that [many communities are engaging in the market
economy.]{.underline} Accordingly, [the question should be about how to
engage in a manner that supports Indigenous sovereignty and
prosperity.]{.underline} [It is necessary to reimagine how Indigenous
peoples' economic development opportunities---largely disrupted by
Western legal systems that solely focused on recognizing non-Indigenous
interests at the expense of Indigenous interests---can be informed by
Indigenous legal orders.]{.underline}

Establishing renewability is challenging, but it remains a remedy to
extractivism and ecological catastrophe. Various [[**Indigenous**
**traditions**]{.mark} [and **practices**]{.mark} that]{.underline},
before the onset of industrialisation (Deloria, 1999; Hatfield et al.,
2018; Ulloa, 2020), [cohabited and continue to this day to cohabit with
the planet [are]{.mark} certainly [examples of **(real) socio-ecological
sustainability and renewability**]{.mark}]{.underline} or, at least, are
closer to it. [[(Neo)colonialism, modernity and
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, and their products, [[are
spreading]{.mark} everywhere---[creating **ruptures** with renewable
socio-ecological relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline} Winona LaDuke and
Deborah Cowen (2020, 253) remind us that [human activity should be
'rooted in a practice of relationality that understands human and
more-than-human life as kin, as familial relations']{.underline} (see
also Simpson, 2014). [[Acknowledging]{.underline}]{.mark}, [respecting
and living with [non-human life]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. animals,
trees, rivers, mountains), [[and challenging anthropocentrism]{.mark}
[and materialism]{.mark}]{.underline} (in the mechanical philosophy
sense), [offers important pathways to [challenge
**extractivism**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[as countless **Indigenous land
defenders**]{.mark} [do]{.mark} across the world]{.underline} (Blaser,
2013; Escobar, 2020; Springer et al., 2021)---[[and]{.mark} to
[begin]{.mark} conceptualising **[real socioecological
renewability]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This means remembering, as Leanne
B. Simpson (2014, 9--10) explains, that [humans are 'dependent upon
intimate relationships of reciprocity, humility, honesty and respect
with all elements of creation, including plants and
animals']{.underline} (see also Escobar, 2020). **[Extractivism denies
this reality]{.underline}**, [instead viewing everything as a 'resource'
and a commodity to be taken, marketed, and sold]{.underline}
(Grosfoguel, 2016; Simpson, 2019). This also relates to the 'predator
prey bargain', popularised by Derrick Jensen (2006, 179),6 which
conceptualises, based on Indigenous practices, our responsibility with
regard to consumption and, by extension, 'resource use'.

If you live on a piece of land-if you own a piece of land-if you consume
the flesh that is on that land, you are now responsible for the
continuation of that land and its health. You are now responsible for
the health of all the various communities who share that land with you.
And because members of this community will consume your flesh, too, they
will be just as responsible for the continuation and health of your
community. At that point you will own the land, and it will own you.

jensen, 2006, 197

This conceptualises how to organise systems based on care and
renewability, as opposed to plunder and extractivism. Moreover, it is a
reminder that [we share our habitats with other peoples]{.underline},
which also stresses that [if people damage or destroy their habitats,
they are destroying themselves.]{.underline} The anarchist slogan,
'destroy what destroys you', obtains greater significance from this
perspective. The carelessness of and the destruction wrought by
modernist development have gone on so long that they are resulting in
climate change and weather extremes (Hickel, 2020). This understanding,
then, adds to our conceptualisation of renewability as well as of
extractivism. [Extractivism is thus defined as cutting, fracturing,
taking, usurping and disregarding humans and non-humans without
intention or plan to fully and adequately redress the resulting violence
and harm.]{.underline}

Similarly, Anderson et al assert that Indigenous economic participation
should be grounded in traditional values. They advocate for the
principles of social entrepreneurship, which align economic engagement
with a defined social purpose. Social entrepreneurship takes into
account certain socially defined limits on economic activity. As wealth
increases and communities are able to provide targeted access to
education, housing, social programs, and health care, to name a few, the
well-being of community members also increases.58 Through social
entrepreneurship, Indigenous peoples can benefit from long-term economic
growth, not as an end in itself, but rather as a means to promote the
control of traditional lands and local activities.59 While this is an
effective means for Indigenous entrepreneurs, [models of social
entrepreneurship developed by non-Indigenous peoples do not consider
**Indigenous sovereignty** and the role of **Indigenous legal
traditions** and values in shaping business, including in social
enterprises.]{.underline}

Each of the above authors make a valuable contribution to the
scholarship on Indigenous economic development. In expanding upon these
scholarly contributions, this article is concerned with the role law has
played, and can play, in shaping Indigenous economic development. [Given
the impact law has had in advancing capitalism and adversely impacting
Indigenous sovereignty, one cannot consider solutions exclusive of the
law.]{.underline} [It is not enough to say that capitalism and
Indigenous economic values diverge, or that the core tenets of
capitalism are so dominant that they will lessen the value of Indigenous
traditions.]{.underline}60 Rather, [**examining** the legal system that
was, and remains, instrumental in advancing capitalism may assist in
**dismantling** its effects.]{.underline} [This requires a **reckoning**
with how one economic system became the most pervasive and dominant
system for conducting business and engaging in economic activity in the
Western world.]{.underline}

Arguably, [just as strengthening Western law played a critical role in
advancing capitalism, **strengthening Indigenous law** can play a
profoundly critical role in advancing **Indigenous sovereignty**,
**self-determination**, and **prosperity**.]{.underline} [One cannot so
easily get away from the way law materially shapes the lives of
individuals in the particular societies in which they live.]{.underline}
[Western law has been, and is, a powerful accomplice in the
dispossession of Indigenous sovereignty and lands which has resulted in
substantial economic inequity]{.underline}. [However, reclaiming and
incorporating Indigenous laws, rooted in Indigenous knowledge and social
systems, into Indigenous economic development initiatives and processes
is a way to counter these effects.]{.underline}

While Newhouse did not specifically implicate the law, he alluded to the
ways that **[capitalism could be countered by incorporating Indigenous
values in economic development.]{.underline}** Likewise, Atleo concedes
that [a resurgence of **Indigenous** **knowledges**, traditions,
culture, and values may **counter the impacts of capitalism** on
Indigenous economic development]{.underline}. [However, there needs to
be something more.]{.underline} That "something more" is the way in
which law is understood in Canada. Because Indigenous laws have largely
been ignored and, more importantly, overruled by Western law within the
greater Canadian legal system, their authority has been significantly
eroded.61 The ways Western law has been applied to determine the
significant legal, economic, political, and social outcomes of
Indigenous peoples should no longer be reinforced by the Canadian state.
Arguably, [seeking solutions solely through the same system of law that
disrupted Indigenous sovereignty, and, in turn, economic prosperity, is
an exercise in futility.]{.underline}

[It is in **redefining legal identity** that the law has the potential
to have an emancipatory effect for Indigenous peoples, and a positive
impact on Indigenous prosperity.]{.underline} Specifically, the function
of Indigenous legal orders can lead to this emancipatory effect. That
is, the solution lies in Indigenous peoples' meaningful contribution to
shaping legal pluralism in Canada, and in this instance, how Indigenous
law can shape economic development. Indigenous legal traditions have a
long history in Canada and many communities have developed complex
systems of law based on traditional knowledge and stories. As discussed
in the following section, by respecting the principle of Two-Eyed
Seeing, these laws can not only be recognized within the Canadian legal
system but legally validated in the same manner as the common and civil
law systems.

Looking, Going Back

[[Black-Indigenism gives name to and/or subsumes particular types of
de-/anti-colonial thought and praxis that have long been in existence,
namely, de-/anti-colonial thought and praxes that prioritize the
experiences and liberation of both Black and Indigenous peoples]{.mark}
worldwide]{.underline}. In the Black American context, a protectionist
or nation-bound experience of Blackness often obscures Black American
connection to and involvement with historic intra- and international
liberation movements (Clemons & Jones, 2001, p. 20). Despite this lack
of acknowledgement, [the numerous examples of Black American engagement
with diasporic or other-worldly liberatory work hints at the pos-
sibilities promised within the wider Black-Indigenist
paradigm.]{.underline}

Drake (1993) notes that [Haitian independence became a symbolic of the
global Diasporic Black imaginary as a "'real' history" that was
"available for inspiration instead of mythic history"]{.underline} (p.
452). Further, from the time of Haitian independence [throughout the
1800 s,]{.underline} [Black American emigrationists offered departure
from the United States as the primary solution to the ills of anti-Black
settler colonialism]{.underline}, while W.E.B. DuBois, Anna Julia
Cooper, and Marcus Garvey (who was active both in his home country of
Jamaica as well as the United States) all famously addressed the plights
of African- descended peoples around the world (Clemons & Jones, 2001,
p. 20). [The 1950s-1960s independence movements of sub-Saharan African
countries were compelling to Black movements worldwide, and Black
American civil rights leaders' and organizations' later opposition to
the Vietnam War was well-known and based on implications that the war
was part of the larger and historical Western imperialist and
colonialist project.]{.underline} And, while [the Black Panther Party's
work]{.underline} and thought were heavily influenced by those resisting
imperialist and colonialist domination in their own contexts (such as
Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Frantz Fanon, and Kwame Nkrumah), the Party
also [heavily influenced the work and thought of groups resisting
colonialist and racist contexts around the globe, including groups in
Israel, India, England, Australia, Bermuda, and the Bahamas]{.underline}
(Clemons & Jones, 2001; McCartney, 2001).

[These examples point to a Pan-Africanism orientation to
Black-Indigenist decolonizing movements.]{.underline} Drake (1993)
defined "traditional Pan-African activity" as "movement ... within
various parts of the \[B\]lack world to increase cultural contacts
between its diverse segments and to unite them in pursuit of common
interests," while defining the Black world as including "all those areas
where the population is actually \[B\]lack in a pheno- typic sense ...
or where the people think of themselves as \[B\]lack despite
\[additional non-African ancestry\] or where they are so defined by
others" (p. 453). In addition to this, cultural Pan-Africanism
highlights cultural ties between Black Diasporic and African peoples,
and does not necessarily have political aims (Drake, 1993, p. 463).
Drake notes that the most nuanced traditional Pan-Africanist political
thought and action connects global Black struggle to the struggles of
all oppressed peoples in the Global South -- and working-class peoples
around the world, whether in rural or urban environments -- while not
allowing Black interests to irretrievably disappear into those
struggles. Further, such nuance demands that Black people should
"maintain a high level of race con- sciousness in their local
situations" (Drake, 1993, p. 463).

While Pan-Africanist thought and work is reflected in the priorities of
Black- Indigenism, [[Black-Indigenism contends that the concept of
indigeneity is equally as important as that of Blackness,]{.mark} as
both concepts serve related and principal functions vis-\`a-vis Western
colonialism.]{.underline} [[Within Black-Indigenism, **liberation for
Black people about the world cannot be responsibly obtained without the
liberation of Indigenous people as well, and vice
versa**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Because of this, while Pan-Africanist
thought provides important supports for Black-Indigenism, it is not
complete, in that it primarily attends to the struggles and intelligence
of one (albeit massive) group of Indigenous peoples -- Black Africans --
rather than to those of Indigenous peoples the world over. In other
words, [Black-Indigenism equally attends to the struggles of Diasporic
Blacks]{.underline} (as the group that has been historically forced to
lose their indigeneity) [and the struggles of global Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (as the group that has historically struggled to
maintain their indigeneity and/or Indigenous lands) [in an effort to
resist and heal from the effects of centuries of Western colonialist
dominance.]{.underline}

[With this Black-Indigenist dual prioritization in mind and within the
US context]{.underline}, it is important to note that documentation of
direct connections between Native and Black American resistance and
resilience work is not quite as pervasive as discussions of
Black-American Pan-Africanist work. Examples do exist, however. Jack
Forbes (1993) notes that, [in addition to researcher assertions of
Indigenous African and American maritime travel to each other's
respective continents before Columbus' landing, the "greatest degree of
intense contact between Americans and Africans did not occur ini- tially
in either the Americas or Africa, but rather in European
cities]{.underline} such as Lisbon, Seville and Valencia" [due to
Europe's trade in both Indigenous Americans and Africans during and
after the time of Columbus' genocidal exploits]{.underline} (p. 26). The
Iberian Peninsula had a long history of enslavement, with enslaved
peoples of "all colors and of many nationalities" becoming part of the
regional socioeconomic fabric throughout the fif- teenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth centuries (Forbes, 1993, p. 27). While most of the enslaved
peoples were historically of European and North African descent,
increasing incursions into the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa brought
increasingly larger num- bers Indigenous peoples from both of these
continents together in Spain and Portugal.

As it became more economically expedient to keep Indigenous Americans
within the Americas, and as the plantation empires overtook the search
for precious metals, more and more Indigenous Americans were shipped
throughout the American contin- ent, while more and more Indigenous
Africans were kidnapped and brought to the Americas. Despite this
dominant trend, there is still evidence of Indigenous Americans' being
brought to Europe at the same time Indigenous Africans were, and even
evi- dence of Indigenous Americans' being sent to Africa -- whether as
enslaved or free workers, or for punishment (Forbes, 1993, pp. 37--39).4

While it can be easily assumed that such an extensive history of shared
enslave- ment encouraged the comingling of two groups who had never
previously encoun- tered each other in such numbers[, [this
history]{.underline}]{.mark} [often [encouraged]{.mark} [shared
resistance]{.mark} as well]{.underline}. [Perhaps the best long-term
example of this [shared resistance is in marronage and resistance
against enslavement]{.mark}, the phenomenon that took place across the
Americas as an often joint Indigenous American and
African/African-descended response to enslavement.]{.underline}
Beginning with the account of enslaved Africans and African-descended
people that were abandoned by or overtook their captors to escape "into
the interior of the US," Douglas (2015) goes on to explain Indigenous
American support of and/or subsequent community-making with formerly
enslaved African/African-descended people over 300 years ... and
European fear of such connections.

Early on in his book Robinson (1997) notes that, [with the "enactment of
the slave codes, both Black and Native American slaves were denied
allies in the Euro-American poor"]{.underline} (p. 9), indicating that,
[until 1776, slave revolts could have included enslaved Indigenous
Americans as well]{.underline} -- or enslaved people of both American
and African descent -- rather than Indigenous Americans' solely fighting
as allies of enslaved African-descended peoples. Further, Robinson
(1997) cites Aptheker (1939), who asserted that there was evidence of at
least 50 maroon communities in the southern United States (dated from
1672 to 1864), and that, contrary to what even the few his- torians of
marronage assert, "marronage ... was not just a Black phenomenon":
indeed, maroon communities not only included formerly enslaved
Indigenous Americans, or Indigenous Americans from "'destroyed
nations,'" but even the descents of escaped European indentured servants
and other poor Whites "'for whom there was no place in plantation
society'" (Learning cited in Robinson, 1997, p. 13). In fact, the very
first maroon communities in the English colonies were established by
European indentured servants, with the practice being overtaken by
non-European- descended peoples as Indigenous American genocide and
African enslavement expanded. For nearly 200 years, then, mixed-race,
predominantly Indigenous and Black American free communities existed
within the present-day states of Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana at the
same time that the dominant sociopolitical systems of this region were
primarily based on racial segregation, enslavement, and Indigenous
genocide. Virginia's Dismal Swamp, Florida's Gracia Real de Santa Teresa
de Mose (likely an inspiration and a draw for enslaved people even
before Florida was taken by the United States), and many, many other
maroon communities throughout the Americas stood as testaments to the
fact that another world was possible -- a world in which the most
oppressed were able to conduct their lives in peace, safety, and
community without the constant threats of bondage or obliteration.

The above examples show that such [[collaborations repeatedly resulted
in sustained resistance to and survival despite dominant settler
colonial repression within the so- called United
States.]{.underline}]{.mark} These examples show us that **[[the concept
of Black-Indigenism is not only not new, but has a rich, extensive
history of collaborations between Indigenous Americans and
Africans/African-descended peoples toward survival under
settler-colonial power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [While there are
unfortunate US examples of Indigenous American enslavement of Blacks;
the ostracizing of peoples of mixed Indigenous and Black American
descent; and of Indigenous and Black American mistreatment, violence,
polic- ing, and capture of each other in service to the settler colonial
project, it is important to view these examples within the context of a
society that has required violence against and the enslavement and death
of American Indigenous and African/African-descended people from its
beginnings.]{.underline} It is likely impossible for all people to
resist at all times, par- ticularly when their survival or safety
depends on their not resisting, or when a key strategy of the dominant
society is to pit groups against each other.

1 Introduction

Rural [[**environmental adaptation** poses urgent challenges for
policymakers and societies]{.underline}]{.mark}. The World Bank
estimates that as many as 216 million people in vulnerable regions will
be internally displaced by climate-related events by 2050 (Clement et
al. 2021). The [scale and urgency]{.underline} of this multi-faceted
problem [[require aligning governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and NGOs
[[to support community-scale adaptation]{.mark} while minimizing
suffering and loss of autonomy.]{.underline} [[This is particularly true
for **Indigenous communities**]{.underline}, [whose ongoing battles for
**self-determination** are **doubly threatened**, as both environmental
change and adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., forced relocation)
[[can **impinge** upon **sovereignty**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its dynamic hazard landscape
and shifting baselines, [p[oses]{.mark}]{.underline} a unique set of
[[challenges for disaster response and hazard
mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wilby and Keenan 2012). Many
well-intentioned rural climate adaptation efforts fall short of their
goals, often due to a combination of poor program design, ineffective
goal-setting, and fraught power dynamics (Pennington 2023). As a result,
[many governments and institutions are developing novel legal,
bureaucratic, and technical frameworks for adaptation and
resilience]{.underline} for threatened communities. The past decade has
seen a proliferation of such strategies and policies to improve
environmental adaptation and reduce maladaptation (Barnett and O'Neill
2010; Ulibarri et al. 2022). These new tools target diverse social and
political landscapes, from small island nations (Mcleod et al. 2019) to
large cities (Anguelovski et al. 2014). Given the breadth of human
societies and the myriad manifestations of environmental change,
strategies that work well in one context are not necessarily well-suited
to another.

This paper uses the concept of [**[micropolitics]{.underline}** to [draw
attention to a category of **procedural failures** in environmental
adaptation that are not policy failures per se, but **failures** in the
**implementation** of these policies, particularly when deployed in
cross-cultural or colonial settings.]{.underline} [These
failures]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[arise in mundane
issues]{.underline}]{.mark} that are missed in the high-level design of
the policies in question. They are adjacent to, but separate from,
issues of policy, goodwill, resource scarcity, or technical possibility.
[[Micropolitics are not micro because they are small or unimportant, but
rather because they are **fine-grained** and **easily
overlooked**.]{.underline} [Resolving micropolitical issues requires
**improved attention to the lived experiences** of threatened
communities and the dynamics that govern their interactions with
settler]{.underline}]{.mark} [[governments]{.underline}.]{.mark}

In the specific context of environmental adaptation[, [micropolitical
issues include]{.underline}]{.mark} (but are hardly limited to[)
[substandard communication between communities and
governments]{.underline}]{.mark} (Marino 2015); [[failure to incorporate
systems of traditional knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} and governance
[[into adaptation plans]{.underline}]{.mark} (Raymond-Yakoubian et al.
2017); [[setting unrealistic expectations for small communities'
technical capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} (Minnes and Vodden 2017);
[failure to build trust]{.underline} (Whyte 2020); [[and simple
ignorance of historical contexts that necessitate an intersectional
approach to adaptation planning]{.underline}]{.mark} (Marino 2012;
Marter-Kenyon 2020; Whyte 2018).

purposes for which water control and improvement districts may be

\"**development**\"]{.underline} of the waters of the State\'s rivers

district such as the LCRA may use the State\'s waters to aid, promote,
or facilitate the generation of  \[\*8\] power. While Wynne contends
that the term \"power\" should be read to be limited to hydroelectric
power, the provision itself contains no such limitation. Moreover,
production of power by means other than hydroelectric generation falls
squarely within the expressly permitted \"other useful purposes\" to
which the State\'s water may be put---i.e., providing power for use by
the State\'s citizens.

[Arctic, northernmost region of Earth, centred on the North Pole and
characterized by distinctively polar conditions of climate, plant and
animal life, and other physical features.]{.underline} The term is
derived from the Greek arktos ("bear"), referring to the northern
constellation of the Bear[. It has sometimes been used to designate the
area within the Arctic Circle---a mathematical line that is drawn at
latitude 66°30′ N, marking the southern limit of the zone in which there
is at least one annual period of 24 hours during which the sun does not
set and one during which it does not rise.]{.underline} This line,
however, is without value as a geographic boundary, since it is not
keyed to the nature of the terrain.

[While no dividing line is completely definitive, a generally useful
guide is the irregular line marking the northernmost limit of the stands
of trees.]{.underline} The regions north of the tree line [include
Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat), Svalbard, and other polar islands; the
northern parts of the mainlands of Siberia, Alaska, and Canada; the
coasts of Labrador; the north of Iceland; and a strip of the Arctic
coast of Europe.]{.underline} The last-named area, however, is
classified as subarctic because of other factors.

University, "Marx's Theory of Metabolism in the Age of Global Ecological
Crisis." Historical Materialism, Vol. 28, Issue 2, p. 3-24, HDCSW-TM\]

[The metabolic rift deepens with the development of
capitalism.]{.underline} In many cases, [it manifests itself as the
exhaustion of natural resources]{.underline}, their increase in price
and the corresponding fall of the rate of profit. Thus, [it
is]{.underline} quite [essential for capital to secure access to cheap
resources, energy and food. This is what leads capital to construct 'a
system of general exploitation of the natural and human
qualities]{.underline}' and 'a system of general utility' as Marx argued
in the Grundrisse:

> Hence exploration of all of nature in order to discover new, useful
> qualities in things; universal exchange of the products of all alien
> climates and lands; new (artificial) preparation of natural objects,
> by which they are given new use values. The exploration of the earth
> in all directions, to discover new things of use as well as new useful
> qualities of the old; such as new qualities of them as raw materials
> etc.34

This exploration of the earth and the [invention of **new
[technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} by capital, however, [[**do not
repair the rift.** The rift remains **'irreparable' in capitalism.**
There is]{.mark} ultimately [the need to 'shift' the metabolic
rift]{.mark} to [somewhere else]{.mark}, not only [for the sake of
buying time]{.mark} but [also for minimising the manifestation of
contradictions in the centre.]{.mark}]{.underline}35 Here, corresponding
to the three dimensions of metabolic rift, there are also three ways of
shifting it.

First of all, [the metabolic rift manifested as the exhaustion of
natural resources, like soil exhaustion. Although]{.underline} Liebig
warned against the collapse of European civilisation due to robbery
agriculture, his prediction did not come true. This was because Fritz
Haber and Carl Bosch invented the so-called Haber--Bosch process in 1906
that enabled the industrial production of ammonia, and thus of chemical
fertiliser.

Nevertheless, the Haber--Bosch process did not heal the rift. The
production of ammonia (NH3) uses a massive amount of natural gas as a
source of hydrogen (H). It simply uses another limited resource to
produce ammonia, but it is quite energy intensive (it uses 2% of total
energy consumption) and produces a lot of CO2 (1% of the total carbon
emission). Furthermore, excessive usage of chemical fertiliser causes
eutrophication, as nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as water pollution,
as a result of their leaking into the environment. Soil ecology is
disrupted by the chemical fertiliser, the water-retaining capacity of
the soil goes down, and plants become more susceptible to disease.
Consequently, more and more fertiliser becomes necessary, as well as
agrochemicals and pesticide. These chemicals also pollute the
environment and disrupt the normal functioning of the ecosystem,
deepening the ecological crisis.

In short, [metabolic **[shift creates externality with]{.mark} the aid
of [new technologies]{.mark}**[:]{.mark} Soil fertility is artificially
maintained and even strengthened, while capital does not pay for
disruption, pollution and destruction in the wider
eco-systems.]{.underline} At the same time, [capital finds new business
opportunities in these disruptions, taking the opportunity to sell more
chemical fertiliser, agrochemicals and pesticide. This is how the formal
and real subsumption of nature under capital proceeds through the
metabolic shift.]{.underline}36

Secondly, there is spatial shift of the metabolic rift. Again, Marx
discussed this issue in relation to soil exhaustion. On the coast of
Peru there were small islands consisting of the excrement of seabirds
that had accumulated over many years. These islands were called guano
islands. Guano is quite rich in minerals that are useful for inducing
plant growth. 'Guano' originally meaning agricultural fertiliser in the
Andean Indigenous language Quechua, the Indigenous people traditionally
used it as dung. It was Alexander von Humboldt who encountered the
Indigenous usage of guano during his research trip to Peru in 1802. He
investigated the effectiveness of guano and tested it in European soils.
The result was positive, and its usage became quite popular across those
areas of Europe where soil exhaustion was a major social issue.

Soil exhaustion was a manifestation of the metabolic rift, but the
'solution' of guano did not repair the rift, as it simply shifted the
problem to the Global South. As a result, guano was continuously
transported from the periphery to the centre of capitalism, which
sustained soil fertility in Europe and the USA, thus providing food for
urban workers. On the other hand, its externality emerged in the form of
brutal oppression of Indigenous people, severe exploitation of thousands
of Chinese coolies, the rapid exhaustion of guano stocks, and more
general environmental degradation. Ultimately, the exhaustion of guano
reserves led to the Guano War (1865--6) and the Saltpeter War
(1879--84). In short, the antagonism between town and country within one
nation was spatially shifted and expanded to the global rift through
guano. As John Bellamy Foster and Brett Clark argue, such [**[a solution
in]{.underline}** [favour of the **Global North led to 'ecological
imperialism'.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Robbery continued. [Although
ecological [imperialism **shifts the rift to the peripheries** and makes
it **invisible in the centre**]{.mark}, the metabolic rift
deepens.]{.underline}37

A similar ecologically unequal exchange persists in today's globalised
capitalism. [As a solution to climate crisis, **[solar power is
essential, but]{.mark}** the [associated]{.mark} battery [technology
uses]{.mark} various kinds of [rare metals.]{.mark}]{.underline} For
example, [most of the world's [lithium is located in]{.mark} the Andean
plateau]{.underline}, so [[Chile]{.mark} has become the largest lithium
exporter.]{.underline} The Salar de Atacama salt flat is where all the
lithium of Chile is extracted. Lithium only exists [in dry
places]{.underline} such as the large salt flats, as it is only
gradually condensed in brine over a long period. [Mining lithium
is]{.underline} thus [conducted by extracting this brine]{.underline}
beneath the salt flats of Salar de Atacama and [by letting the water
evaporate such as to allow the further concentration of
lithium.]{.underline}

In this situation, it is quite obvious that [**[excessive
mining]{.mark}** of brine makes the area even drier and also **[degrades
the eco-system]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It endangers the Andean flamingo,
which eats brine shrimp. Furthermore, [[it causes a lowering]{.mark} of
the [water table, **reducing access to fresh water for
Indigenous**]{.mark} **[Antacameño communities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}38
[The situation is exacerbated by copper mining that]{.underline} also
[extracts massive quantities of freshwater]{.underline} in the Salar. In
other words, [the [greening of the Global North is not]{.mark}
transforming the planet [sustainably, but]{.mark} rather
[strengthening]{.mark} the [robbery-mining]{.mark} processes of lithium
and copper.]{.underline} The metabolic rift cannot be simply repaired by
new technologies. [[**Technological solutions sound attractive** because
they do not entail]{.mark} us [changing]{.mark} our current
[lifestyle]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [for as long as the current
mode of living continues, [it]{.mark} simply **[shifts the
rift]{.mark}** to [**somewhere else**, deepening the rift on a global
scale.]{.mark}]{.underline} Mészáros rightly warned against technocratic
optimism, 'And finally, [to say that "science and technology can solve
all our problems in the long run" is much worse than believing in
witchcraft'.]{.underline}39

The third kind of metabolic shift is the temporal one. The discrepancy
between nature's time and capital's time does not immediately lead to
ecological disaster. Nature possesses 'elasticity'.40 Climate crisis is
a representative case. [Massive CO2 emission due to the excessive usage
of fossil fuels is an apparent cause of [climate change]{.mark}.
But]{.underline} its [[effects]{.mark} [do not immediately
crystallise]{.mark}, so [capital uses]{.mark} the opportunity opened up
by [the]{.mark} ensuing [time lag to make profits from previous
investment]{.mark} in drills and pipelines. **[Capital reflects the
voice of current shareholders]{.mark}**, but **[not]{.mark}** that of
the **[future generations.]{.mark}** The [costs]{.mark} of robbery [are
shifted]{.mark} on [to them]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result, [future
generations suffer from what they are not responsible for.]{.underline}
Marx famously characterised such an attitude of capitalist development
with the slogan, 'Apès moi, le déluge!'

[There is huge public expectation invested in future technological
innovation against the climate crisis.]{.underline} It is true that
shifting the rift buys time for the development of new technologies.
However, [**[new technologies do not spread quickly]{.mark}** but take
years before they replace the old ones.]{.underline} Continuous temporal
shifts, [**[counting on]{.mark} future [technologies]{.mark}**[,
will]{.mark} inevitably [confront an unexpected worsening of the
crisis]{.mark}, due to positive-feedback mechanisms. [The time
lag]{.mark} of introducing new technologies [makes it]{.mark} even
**[harder to control]{.mark} the situation, [annulling]{.mark} the
[expected results of]{.mark} those [technologies.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

5 Ecological Crisis as the Contradiction of Capitalism

The power of capital to shift the metabolic rift is astonishing. Thus,
[it is questionable whether the increase in prices]{.underline} due to
the 'end of Cheap Nature' [will lead to the 'epochal crisis' of
capitalism,]{.underline} as Jason W. Moore argues.41 Bill McKibben
better describes the historical dynamics of capitalism: '[The diminished
availability of fossil fuel is not the only limit we face.]{.underline}
In fact, [it's not even the most important. Even before we run out of
oil, we're **running out of planet'.**]{.underline}42 This is [not only
because [capital can]{.mark} [find]{.mark} **[new opportunities for a
'climate]{.mark}-change [shock doctrine']{.mark}** amidst the ecological
crisis]{.underline},43 [[but]{.mark} also because [it always]{.mark}
**[externalises]{.mark} the [negative consequences onto the Global
South.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In this way, [[the Global South suffers from doubly negative
consequences]{.mark}. After suffering [from the robbery of]{.mark}
nature and humans under [ecological imperialism, it also faces the real
impact of ecological crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, once [it is no longer
possible to postpone it.]{.underline} As Stephan Lessenich argues,
capital's slogan 'After us, the deluge!' becomes 'Next to us, the
deluge' (Neben uns, die Sintflut), in the age of global ecological
crisis when it is no longer possible to buy time. This is the essence of
the 'externalisation society' (Externalisierungsgesellschaft) that is
dominant in the Global North.44

[Affluent life in the Global North is obviously dependent on
robbery]{.underline} from other areas, but [this structural inequality
and injustice was long kept invisible]{.underline} through the temporal,
spatial and social shift and externalisation of the metabolic rift. This
is what Ulrich Brand and Markus Wissen call the 'imperial mode of
living' (imperiale Lebensweise). Their point is that a better life for a
certain group of people in a certain region presupposes the degradation
of living conditions for another group of people in another region.45
The imperial mode of living essentially signifies a relation of
domination and subordination. The current order of society appears
attractive and comfortable to a certain social group in the Global
North, but its real costs are imposed upon other social groups in other
areas.

Of course, [the fundamental problem is not a 'mode of living' but a
'mode of production',]{.underline} because [the tendency towards the
robbery of humans and nature and [metabolic shift is inherent to the
logic of capital.]{.mark} The imperial mode of production is constantly
reproduced and its **[violence becomes invisible]{.mark}** due to the
metabolic shift.]{.underline} Consequently, [[people]{.mark} who enjoy
the affluent life [in the **Global North are**]{.mark} first **[forced
to be 'ignorant']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Nicht-Wissen[) [**about the
structural inequality** of]{.mark} the [imperial]{.mark} mode of
[production]{.mark}, but later, as long as it promises the affluent
life, [they]{.mark} start to [accept]{.mark} it as something desirable
[and]{.mark} to [internalise it by looking away]{.mark} from the
negative consequences. They do not want to know]{.underline}
(Nicht-Wissen-Wollen). Consequently, the imperial mode of production
transforms into the 'imperial mode of living'.

However, [[it is impossible to endlessly shift the metabolic
rift.]{.mark} It is increasingly difficult to ignore the negative
consequence of metabolic rift, as the competition for robbery becomes
more brutal]{.underline} with the rapid development of China, Brazil and
India. [As the space for externalisation diminishes, the once-obscured
metabolic rift becomes increasingly visible, as the climate crisis
causes heat-waves and super-typhoons, even in the Global
North.]{.underline} Since communism is 'ultimately a question of
justice',46 climate justice is an essential component for communism.
That is why Marx's idea of communism must be radically updated in the
age of global ecological crisis.

Additional crucial flaws would also severely hamper the GND's potential
for real change. Foremost, current variants of the GND retain a
significant [[dependence on]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological
solutions]{.underline} to problems that are not necessarily
technological in nature. They also [[say nothing about the need]{.mark}
to r[educe]{.mark} material [consumption]{.mark} or energy demand
[overall]{.mark}]{.underline} (except 'weatherization' to reduce
domestic consumption). Thus for example, they fail to acknowledge that
[**[even if]{.mark}** the US **[transitioned]{.mark}
[completely]{.mark}** to **renewable energy** and
technologies]{.underline} like electric cars, [[it would]{.mark}
[still]{.mark} be [engaging]{.mark} [in **unsustainable
exploitation**]{.mark} of nature and natural resources.]{.underline}

Moreover, [by focusing]{.underline} heavily [on carbon]{.underline}
reductions, the [[GND]{.mark} [ignores]{.mark}]{.underline} other major
ecological crises, including those of [[biodiversity and ecosystem
loss]{.mark}, driven by uncontrolled consumption in the Global
North.]{.underline} Finally, while it commits to holding corporations
accountable to domestic climate goals and labour standards, it does not
ensure that they will also be held accountable globally (beyond carbon
emissions). Similarly, while Bernie's proposals were committed to ending
rising inequality within the US, through taxes on fossil fuel
billionaires and "green jobs" for low-income sectors, [it is not clear
how]{.underline} this [inequality would be addressed in a way that does
not just shift it outside the US.]{.underline}

As such, the GND cannot adequately challenge the structures of
[capitalism and patriarchy]{.underline}, and from a global perspective
[remains rooted in "green" colonialism. It]{.underline} effectively
[[perpetuates]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[quest for **cheap raw
materials**]{.mark} and **black and brown labouring bodies** [to achieve
**"green" growth**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

In the context of the Global South, then, [the GND]{.underline} has
failed to illustrate what is "new" about it. Put differently, it [is
simply inadequate]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} indeed
[unjust]{.underline}, [in our current hyper-connected world]{.underline}
(laid bare by COVID-19) to limit a GND to the national policy of Global
North countries. For instance, if a GND for Europe promises to be
"climate neutral," [whose resources and labour will be deployed to
power]{.underline} Europe's [unrestrained energy and consumption
demands?]{.underline}

[[This is]{.mark} an [especially **salient
question**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[given]{.mark} how **[renewable
technologies]{.mark}** for "cleaner," "greener" economies
**[depend]{.mark}** on the **[same]{.mark} [socially and ecologically
degrading]{.mark}** land and [labour **practices**]{.mark} as
**traditional energy** sources. They are]{.underline} also [conveniently
located in]{.underline} countries of [the Global South, such as Bolivia
and DR Congo, where regulatory safeguards are more lax.]{.underline} The
[uneven playing field]{.underline} of resources and regulatory
frameworks [works in the favour of those who]{.underline} have not only
historically usurped resources and labouring bodies around the world but
also [currently dictate the modus operandi of development, including its
"greener and eco-friendly" varieties.]{.underline} What is easily
forgotten in [**"[eco-friendly" talk]{.mark}** [is just how development
models of the Global North are **structurally founded on
dehumanization**]{.mark}**,** in which hundreds of millions across the
globe are seduced and stripped of their diverse ways of knowing the
world]{.underline}, and dumbed down into passive consumerist onlookers
and screen junkies, unable or unwilling to acknowledge (much less act
upon) the consequences of their consumption patterns.

Yet, in a world beholden to the imperatives of global capitalism and
statism, ["[finance-rich, resource-poor" countries are increasingly
looking to "resource rich" countries in the Global South to secure their
food and energy]{.mark}]{.underline} needs. While traditional players
(e.g. North America and Europe) [that have been [on the "frontier" of

9.1 Sustainable Ubiquity

Anthropogenic [climate change]{.underline} has a palpable presence---in
[wildfires]{.underline}, [flooding]{.underline}, [drought]{.underline},
annual or even more frequent "once-in-a-century" [weather]{.underline}
events, dangerous levels of wet-bulb and even dry-bulb heat. Then there
is the [grave [social and economic fallout]{.mark} of these
occurrences]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic itself has much to do
with climate change---with an [[intensified "gobbling" of
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} that ["enables viruses to jump from
previously isolated]{.underline} wild [animals into]{.underline} the
[food system]{.underline} and agricultural laborers and then, by way of
food products and travelers, move throughout the world in a matter of
weeks."1 [Pandemics]{.underline} and other infectious disease events
[are]{.underline} already [becoming]{.underline} far more [frequent on
the]{.underline} current business-as-usual [trajectory of global
capitalism]{.underline} and anthropogenic climate change. The [[question
is no longer]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[denial vs.
acceptance]{.underline}]{.mark} of climate science.2 [[It is about power
dynamics]{.mark} [within]{.mark}]{.underline} those [[concrete
realities]{.underline}]{.mark} in this particular conjuncture of the
Anthropocene.

Sustainability is now a commonplace term. Its connotations span from the
minimal definition of sustainability as "avoiding extinction and living
to survive and reproduce"3 to various renditions of "sustainable
development" as "development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs."4 For all the attention given to
[[sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}, it [remains a fuzzy
[concept]{.mark} that [accommodates a multitude of often conflicting
goals]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 Typically, uses of the concept involve or
gesture towards ecological concerns and relate to the broad field of
sustainable development as defined above at the Brundtland Conference in
1987. But, as previous environmental discourses of "natural"
conservation or preservation fall out of use, today's usage of the term
reflects a spreading concern with climate change.

In this chapter, I review some controversies haunting policy and
academic debates on sustainability. Irreconcilable objectives within
commitments to [[sustainability produce]{.underline}]{.mark} what I call
[[a]{.mark} "[sustainability paradox]{.mark}]{.underline}." On the one
hand, analyses, models, [[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, and projects
[[are committed to]{.underline}]{.mark} what we might term
["[fundamental system
preservation]{.mark}"]{.underline}---[not]{.underline} in terms of
[ecological systems but]{.underline} in terms of [dominant human
socioeconomic ones]{.underline}. On the other hand, there is the
understanding that anthropogenic climate change is engendered by that
very [[socioeconomic activity]{.underline}]{.mark}. When a framework
predicated on fundamental (social) system preservation [[tries to
assimilate even minimal inputs from the climate sciences or
interdisciplinary climate research]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
[[resulting]{.mark} "[sustainable" frameworks are fundamentally
incoherent]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [sustainability
paradox]{.underline} thus [arises in seeking maximal socioecological
sustainability through safeguarding]{.underline} [the very social system
that undermines such a possibility]{.underline}.

I offer the concept of "the extractive circuit" to give us a better
guide to what Actually Existing Capitalism is today and the [[vicious
cycle capital deploys in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[metabolic
interchange between society and nature]{.underline}]{.mark}. I then
review scientific, policy, and social scientific bodies of literature
that attempt to "solve" the sustainability paradox in terms of what
appears to be a broad social and ecological definition of
sustainability: the elaboration of a global sustainable human
"ecological niche," well-disposed to the flourishing of some 7--9
billion humans. [[Sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}, understood in
this way, [[calls for a radical new relationship of human
society]{.mark} with its ecological niche, even as it acknowledges that
all programs for climate mitigation and adaptation are, in some sense,
an artificial human contrivance.]{.underline} Key debates, from "green
capitalism" to "degrowth" to eco-Marxism, are reviewed with regard to
the formulas they produce for achieving this objective. Finally, I
propose some broad parameters elaborating a sustainable global human
ecological niche.

9.2 Sustainable Confusion

Prior to Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer's popularization of the
concept of the Anthropocene as a geologic age---one defined by human
activity as "a major geologic force" in terms of the total Earth system6
---natural science typically focused on discrete human-environmental
impacts (like those of pesticides on bird eggs and cancer cells),
whereas contemporary approaches are comprehensive and systemic.7
Prevalent natural and social scientific approaches to sustainability
tend to portray it as a balance between ecological limits, resource use,
and human needs. For example, in an interdisciplinary natural and social
scientific inquiry into ecological economics, the fundamental question
sustainability poses is: "what level of biophysical resource use is
associated with meeting people's basic needs, and can this level of
resource use be extended to all people without exceeding critical
planetary boundaries?"8 The [systemic nature of anthropogenic climate
change means]{.underline} that almost all [[contemporary analysis has
shifted into]{.mark} [thinking beyond knock-on effects and is instead
concerned with how social and natural systems are
co-imbricated]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Seemingly distant social
phenomena]{.underline} can [have ecological implications]{.underline},
and there is nothing particularly more "natural" about Holocene
conditions than Anthropocene ones. And yet, as scholars like Andreas
Malm have argued adamantly, the case can be overstated---humans do not
produce all of nature.9

Obviously, the [sustainability of ecosystem health is hardly the same
as]{.underline} the [concern for sustainability in sustainable
development studies, even if]{.underline} some of [the latter
incorporate ecological concerns]{.underline} and some of the former,
socioeconomic analysis. [Sustainable development]{.underline} in policy
is usually the assumed goal.10 But not only [is]{.underline}
sustainability in such studies [ill-defined]{.underline}, it is
[often]{.underline} here [at odds with itself]{.underline}. Like many
mainstream policy approaches, [[sustainability policy is focused
fundamentally on understandings of ecology and economy that take as
given]{.mark}]{.underline} the [continuity and maintenance of [current
global socioeconomic systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These are
incommensurate goals prima facie]{.mark};]{.underline} [[the
sustainability paradox leaks into]{.underline}]{.mark} even many
[[deliberate attempts to resolve it]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even in the
relatively nascent interdisciplinary field of "sustainability science"
[the core question---"What is to be sustained?"---fails to be
addressed]{.underline}.11

The [[Paris Accords are a key example]{.underline}]{.mark} of how this
question gets avoided, thereby bringing to light the sustainability
paradox. Although the Accords are treated with reverence in many media,
policy, and political circles, even at their inception in 2015, assuming
universal compliance to the non-binding treaty, [it was technically
already impossible to reach]{.underline} the [stated targets of keeping
global temperatures to a less than 1.5 °C]{.underline} increase above
pre-industrial levels over the next 80 years, [within the treaty's
framework.]{.underline} In the simplest terms, [even with a reduction in
the rate of carbon emissions, emissions in toto are on track to increase
by about 3% per year.]{.underline} To hold to the goals of the climate
treaty, [actual emissions---not their rate]{.underline}---[would have to
decrease]{.underline} in the range of [2--3% per year]{.underline}.
Given that [this is impossible under current socioeconomic
conditions]{.underline}, [in most likely scenarios, the 2 °C
increase]{.underline} threshold [will be passed by 2050]{.underline},
[perhaps]{.underline} [as early as the mid-2030s]{.underline}.12
Δ1.5--[2 °]{.underline}C is [for the vast majority of people on the
planet]{.underline}---although not everyone, universally, together, as I
have shown elsewhere13---[already a catastrophic situation]{.underline}.
This is true even for affluent majorities in the developed geographies,
as evidenced by assessment on a host of standard measures, [including
insurmountable prospects for]{.underline} many [coastal
regions]{.underline}, further [food system destabilization]{.underline},
and the direct effects of "[dangerous heat," rampant disease, poverty,
etc.]{.underline} The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) on a Δ1.5 °C world paints an even bleaker picture
for a Δ2 °C world. [This is all without considering]{.underline} further
[social factors aggravating the situation, such as resource warfare and
mass migration]{.underline}.14

9.3 What We Talk About When We Talk About Sustainability

[[Common measures of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} do not track
population growth per se; they do not track increasing consumption from
developing states; they do not track individual consumption choices.
They seem unaffected by common climate interventions, from fuel
efficiency standards to the Paris Accords. They [[track economic
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}.15 [This link is well-established and
uncontroversial]{.underline} (cited for example at the IPCC's highest
confidence levels of "robust evidence and high agreement")16---[[this is
why so much debate surrounds questions of absolute
decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark}, i.e. disconnecting economic growth from
greenhouse gas emissions and other climate metrics. Whether one is
discussing the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century or "the
Great Acceleration"---the period beginning in the mid-twentieth century
of neargeometric, interlinked socioeconomic expansion and anthropogenic
transformation of Earth systems---growth is better understood as
increased economic activity in pursuit of proftability.17 Growth also
must be addressed in more abstract terms, but the centrality of
capitalism to these developments is also uncontroversial. As the
economist Nicholas Stern once claimed, climate change is capitalism's
"largest ever market failure." The implication of Stern's argument is
that climate change is an example of the market malfunctioning---with
just the right policy fix, capitalism should provide its own solution.
In 2012, the geophysicist Brad Werner proffered a rather different
thesis in a talk colorfully entitled "Is the Earth F\*\*ked?" As
Christopher Wright and Daniel Nyberg helpfully summarize: ["we are in
this mess not because the market system is not working well enough but
because it is working too well."]{.underline}18

Werner is far from alone in conclusions like this. Closer to the
generally circumspect norm in the natural sciences concerning social and
political analyses, one finds arguments like those in the now famous
so-called "Hothouse Earth" paper for PNAS ("Trajectories of the Earth
System in the Anthropocene"). Leading a team of climate scientists, Will
Steffen, Johan Rockström, and Katherine Richardson, argue:

> The [present dominant socioeconomic system]{.underline}, however, [is
> based on high-carbon economic growth and exploitative resource
> use]{.underline}. [Attempts to modify this system have met with some
> success locally but little success globally in reducing greenhouse gas
> emissions or building]{.underline} more [effective stewardship of the
> biosphere.]{.underline} [Incremental linear changes to the present
> socioeconomic system are not enough to stabilize the Earth
> System]{.underline}. [[Widespread, rapid, and fundamental
> transformations will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be required to
> reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk of crossing the threshold and
> locking in the Hothouse Earth]{.underline}]{.mark} pathway...19

Overall, the paper's concern is with how much uncertainty there is in
climate models and how often this uncertainty is cast in favor of overly
optimistic outcomes. Echoing many other climate researchers, Steffen et
al collect evidence that [climate change does not happen linearly,
but]{.underline} can instead proceed [through thresholds, triggers,
tipping points, and cascading effects]{.underline}. What is easy to miss
in the paper is the subtle socioeconomic argument. The rhetoric is
understated, but the argument is charged:
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}---that is, "the present dominant
socioeconomic system"---[[is fundamentally dependent on "high-carbon
economic growth and exploitative resource use]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Overall, [the case simply reflects the empirical record]{.underline}.
Similar to the IPCC calls for "unprecedented transformation," the paper
suggests widespread, rapid, and fundamental transformations to ensure a
best-case scenario for the vast majority of people on Earth. This can be
achieved with already existing technology, but if you look at the
appendices Steffen et al include, they spell out conditions that cannot
be reconciled with existing Global North economies. Furthermore, they
are straightforward about [even the most modest techno-fixes such
as]{.underline} Carbon Capture and Storage ([[CSS]{.underline}]{.mark}),
which they correctly note [are [still largely theoretical]{.mark} and at
best energy-intensive to produce.]{.underline}20 "[Incremental linear
changes are not enough,"]{.underline} the authors note. [Small-bore
reforms and modest adjustments to the "dominant socioeconomic system"
are simply not credible forms of climate mitigation and
adaptation]{.underline}.

[Beyond providing financing, the EU adopted the EU Adaptation Strategy

states develop and implement national adaptation plans and strategies,
such that almost all member states by now have developed at least a
national adaptation plan or strategy (EPA 2024) that serves as a guide
for local and regional adaptation efforts.]{.underline} However, despite
recognizing that the EU has a "sound framework for addressing the impact
of climate change," the European Court of Auditors (ECA) stresses that
"adaptation policies experience issues when put into practice" (ECA
2023). It warns that the EU might risk falling behind with respect to
climate adaptation not only due to outdated scientific data but also due
to underestimation of the required financial means.

The first key finding of this study highlights [the remarkable diversity
of adaptation strategies employed by communities in response to climate
change]{.underline}. These strategies [exhibit a wide range of
approaches, from traditional practices rooted in indigenous knowledge to
innovative solutions leveraging modern technology.]{.underline}
[Traditional methods often involve the use of local natural resources
and ancestral knowledge, reflecting a deep understanding of the local
environment and its patterns. In contrast, modern strategies are
characterized by the adoption of new technologies and scientific
approaches, aiming to enhance resilience against climate-related
hazards.]{.underline} The study finds that [agricultural practices, such
as crop diversification and water conservation techniques, are commonly
adopted across various communities. Coastal communities, in particular,
have developed unique strategies for dealing with rising sea levels and
increased salinity,]{.underline} including the construction of raised
houses and the cultivation of salt-tolerant crops.

[Urban communities are observed to focus more on infrastructure
development, such as flood defenses and sustainable urban planning, to
mitigate the impacts of climate change.]{.underline} The findings also
reveal a growing trend in the use of renewable energy sources, such as
solar and wind power, as part of community adaptation efforts[.
Community-based forest management practices have emerged as a
significant strategy in rural areas, contributing to both climate
mitigation and adaptation.]{.underline} In summary, [the diversity of
community adaptation strategies to climate change is vast and
multifaceted, reflecting a rich blend of traditional knowledge and
modern innovation, tailored to specific local contexts and
needs.]{.underline}

prioritize]{.underline} (i) [the forging of meaningful collaborations
between Western and Indigenous Knowledge systems;]{.underline} (ii) [the

of Arctic Indigenous Peoples in having opportunities for equal voice in
the ICARP IV research priority-setting process.]{.underline} While the
ICARP IV process already includes Arctic Indigenous Peoples
organizations as founding members of the International Steering

representation in highest-level decision-making. In addition to
supporting the development of the letter, [the three Arctic Indigenous
scholars leading our project team worked diligently in fall 2023 to
build the number of Arctic Indigenous Knowledge holders directly engaged
with the ICARP IV process. They distributed personal requests for Arctic
Indigenous Peoples' engagement on the six ICARP IV Research Priority

The Trump administration announced today that it will replace the
balanced and science-based Integrated Activity Plan for the Western
Arctic with an aggressively pro-drilling version implemented during the
president's first term. The plan attempts to dictate management of the
23.6 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is the
America's largest tract of public land and the cultural homeland and
subsistence area for Alaska Native communities that depend on its
robust, wild ecosystems that support caribou, geese, loons, broad
whitefish, salmon, polar bears, bowhead whales and millions of migratory
birds. This plan would open up more than 80 percent of the reserve to
destructive oil and gas leasing and development. In response, The
Wilderness Society's senior manager for Alaska, Matt Jackson, released
the following statement: "This is another step in the Trump
administration's reckless effort to sell out our most valuable national
public lands to the oil industry in the midst of the climate crisis.
"They are scrapping a plan that is based on a robust body of science and
traditional ecological knowledge that protects high-value wildlife
habitat and subsistence resources that are vital to local Indigenous
communities across Alaska, and replacing it with a strategy that puts
corporate greed ahead of people." The Arctic is ground zero for climate
change, where temperatures are rising roughly four times faster than
other regions of the planet. Villages are eroding into the sea, thawing
permafrost is making infrastructure insecure and food sources are
disappearing.  Further extraction and burning of oil stored in the
Western Arctic -- and the release of billions of pounds of carbon from
thawing soil and tundra -- would have devastating and irreparable
consequences, and exacerbate climate change, harming not only the Arctic
but all of America.

[The population boom of the past century has caused demand for food
products to skyrocket. As a result, the agricultural sector now
generates **19 to 29 percent of the world's total GHG emissions**. The
current status quo presents a vicious cycle in which agricultural
practices contribute significantly to the climate change problem, which
in turn render our agricultural practices less and less
efficient]{.underline}---meaning that, all else equal, [an increasing
amount of carbon and methane emissions will be needed to produce the
same output.]{.underline} It also means that, as more arable land
becomes impractical for farming, [farmers will have to shrink the
globe's remaining forest to have access to viable growing areas, thus
reducing those regions' ability to absorb carbon.]{.underline} This
issue is compounded by the fact that the world population is expected to
grow by 3.1 billion people between 2020 and 2100 before leveling off.

main concerns: how [generative AI tools may amplify the spread of false

requirements and widespread use of large language models can increase
carbon emissions."]{.underline}

"[Our concerns about AI focus on its potential use to spread climate
disinformation, and its vastly expanding energy use, both of which
require basic transparency rules that are not included in the

wide-ranging executive order Biden signed on artificial intelligence in
October.

The order included new standards for safety and directs federal agencies
to accelerate the development of techniques in order to allow AI systems
to be trained while preserving privacy of the data they're trained on.

[The advocates wrote they were "disappointed that AI's potential to
worsen the climate change crisis" was not addressed as a risk associated
with widespread use of AI in the executive order.]{.underline}

["Unfounded hype from Silicon Valley says that AI can save the planet

### Turn -- climate threat exaggeration 

#### Climate threat exaggeration demobilizes needed action -- and creates backlash -- no real consensus on existential threat of climate change

I have argued that [the "plausible" risks of climate change are commonly
exaggerated within the climate community]{.underline}. Recall for
example, Christiana Figueres, 2020, "The scary thing is that after 2030
it basically doesn't really matter what humans do"; Kevin Drum, 2019,
"\[The Green New Deal\] would only change the dates for planetary
suicide by a decade or so";  Frank Fenner, 2010,  "We're going to become
extinct. Whatever we do now is too late." Many more in the same doomsday
vein.

[We have seen that the standard global warming models have a powerful
built-in bias to exaggerate the rate of future temperature rise, as seen
in (most of) them "hindcasting" temperature rises several times faster
than actually observed. We have seen that forecasters commonly take
"worst-case scenarios" as "likely scenarios in the absence of radical
action]{.underline}" (eg reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050), to
the point where Nature recently published a paper sub-titled, "Stop
using the worst-case scenario for climate warming as the most likely
outcome".  

[The dismaying thing is that scientists and advocates have been making
catastrophising global warming forecasts of this kind for decades
past]{.underline}, normally dated some 10 to 30 years into the future.
[The due date comes without catastrophe, but never a retrospective
holding to account.]{.underline} [Rather, on to the next catastrophising
forecast another 10 to 30 years ahead.]{.underline}
[Scientists-writers-activists know the catastrophe forecasts get the
attention, the clicks, the research funding]{.underline}. We saw the
exaggeration mechanism spelled out by Richard Betts of the BBC, Holman
Jenkins of the Wall St Journal, and climate scientist Judith Curry.

The built-in exaggeration of the costs of climate change blunts the
parallel with nuclear power plants. We know with high certainty the
costs of nuclear explosions. We know the costs of global temperature
going above 1.5 C above "pre-industrial" much less certainly, and we can
see the mechanisms by which the likely costs are being systematically
exaggerated.

On the other hand, [there is abundant evidence that even without the
doomsday exaggerations the plausible risks of climate change could be
very serious]{.underline}, in particular because of the inherent
political economy difficulty of getting needed global or regional
cooperation when political action is mostly at the level of sovereign
nation states (see [[the
G20]{.underline}](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23265028?refreqid=excelsior%3Acb0d68ee96d5e42fd9cf91767b4f07b3)).

[Coal power generation is the single biggest source of GHG emissions,
and emissions from coal  consumption will probably not fall fast,
whatever the promises]{.underline}. First, coal is cheap, accessible and
generates reliable power for many developing countries; in Asia, coal
alone generates 40 percent of energy consumption, much higher than the
world average of 29 percent. (12) Second,  developing countries,
including China, assert a strong claim on carbon space to power their
economic development.  They see it partly as a matter of fundamental
justice, since developed countries emitted most of the CO2 that is
already in the atmosphere and seas as the necessary condition for them
becoming developed.  [Developed countries promise  finance and technical
assistance on a massive scale to accelerate the energy transition in
developing]{.underline} countries -- [and have a long track record of
leaving promises as promises]{.underline}. (See the global distribution

plants]{.underline}](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-new-coal-power-plant-climate-change-tokyo-a9316271.html),
as it closes nuclear plants in the wake of Fukushima.

Then comes a question:  does drawing attention to the doomsday
exaggerations of the CCC -- "disaster", "catastrophe", "extinction",
"fiddling while the planet burns" - serve to *reduce the political and
public pressures for necessary ameliorative action*, in a world where
powerful fossil lobbies seek to block or delay such action for reasons
independent of "evidence"?  Should "Third Way" essays like this one not
be published, because "give them (deniers, sceptics) an inch and they
will take a mile"?  To what extent must mass publics be "panicked" in
order to induce enough collective political and business action --
national, international -- to substantially slow the growth of GHG
emissions?  If we can sustain emission- and temperature-curbing action
only by holding up the certainty of disaster, catastrophe, extinction,
then better to let the doomsday exaggerations continue as the necessary
condition for that ameliorative action. What is the harm, when the
alternative is ruin for humanity and the biosphere?

[The danger is that the repeated wild exaggerations  produce a public
backlash, a discrediting, and a strengthening of the many
"deniers"]{.underline} who see "leftists, governments, and the United
Nations" as the source of malevolence in the world. A more accurate
accounting of the evidence would (hopefully) produce a more calibrated
and sustained public and business response.  

### Extension -- no scientific consensus 

**Conflation of different scientific opinions creates fake consensus**

[Scientific support]{.underline} comes [from the fact]{.underline} that
[97% of climate scientists agree that man-made greenhouse gases have
been responsible for "most" of the warming of the Earth's average
temperature over the second half of the twentieth century. The 3% who
are sceptical are not highly regarded scientists and some are in the pay
of fossil fuel interests.]{.underline}

In the face of this scientific, interstate, and corporate agreement
about the necessity of a global Big Push to cut CO2 emissions fast,
[developing countries and China carry a heavy responsibility, because
they are the major source of global CO2 emissions]{.underline}, mainly
from their consumption of fossil fuels. They must [quickly follow the
developed countries in investing on a massive scale in sources of
renewable energy, whose prices are falling fast. Developed countries
will offer large-scale financing and technical assistance for them to
make the switch -- in the developed countries'
self-interest.]{.underline}

It is [true that developed countries put up most of the stock of
greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere as they used fossil fuels to
power their ascent to the top of the global hierarchy of income and
wealth over the past two centuries. But that gives developing countries,
even though they remain well down the income hierarchy, no justification
for saying that they therefore have the right to carbon space for
powering their economic development]{.underline} -- because continuing
to use relatively accessible, cheap and reliable fossil-fuel energy to
power their growth pushes all humanity and the biosphere towards ruin.

Do Virtually all Climate Scientists Agree with the CCC?

It is widely cited that "97% of climate scientists agree warming is
man-made"; or more exactly, "97% of science papers taking a position on
climate change say it is man-made". The conclusion is frequently amped
up to "a 97% consensus that 'humans are causing a global warming
crisis'".

Note that this [last statement -- with "crisis" -- is not the same as
the previous two, but all three statements tend to be conflated, so that
people agreeing with "most recent warming is man-made" tend to be scored
as agreeing that global warming is a crisis, which commonly gets
inflated into agreeing that it is an existential crisis or the
existential crisis.]{.underline}

Note that these statements of "consensus" do not specify the time
period.

Note also that "[high consensus" in science is only a weak criterion of
"truth" in science]{.underline} -- but the 97% figure is often deployed
as [evidence of the "truth" that warming is man-made. Of course, it is
worth knowing to what extent there are "widely accepted truths" in any
field. But problems come when the "fact" of consensus is established in
a clearly tendentious way.]{.underline}

#### Climate models heavily exaggerate effects of climate change spilling over to newer generations of models that miscalculate even more.

HDCSW-KGrid 7/15/25\]

It is [testimony to the pervasive anxiety of the zeitgeist that such
surveys are routinely cited as demonstrating a near-unanimous scientific
consensus in favor of radical, far-reaching climate policy]{.underline}
(including for energy, food and materials), when [the surveys do not
even ask the question as to whether the respondent considers that (a)
the anthropogenic component of recent warming is dangerous, and (b)
dangerous enough to require a global climate policy. The surveys are
almost valueless scientifically, but valuable politically.]{.underline}

Upward Bias in Temperature Forecasting Models

The [prospect of a coming catastrophe for humanity and the biosphere
rests heavily on outputs of climate forecasting models. But as David
Legates and co-authors argue, these models "exhibit a strong
exaggeration in their results even when narrowly adopting atmospheric
carbon dioxide as the sole driver of climate responses]{.underline}....
\[General circulation models, such as those of the IPCC, the
[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\] have consistently
overestimated the climate sensitivity to rising atmospheric carbon
dioxide."]{.underline}

Ross McKitrick (2020) begins his assessment, "Two new peer-reviewed
papers from independent teams confirm [that climate models overstate
atmospheric warming, and the problem \[of overstatement\] has gotten
worse over time, not better]{.underline}". One of the papers (by
McKitrick and John Christy) examined 38 models, the other, 48 models,
used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the
various US "National Assessments", the EPA's "Endangerment Finding", and
more.

McKitrick continues, "Both papers [looked at 'hindcasts', which are
reconstructions of recent historical temperatures in response to
observed greenhouse gas emissions and other changes]{.underline} (eg
aerosols and solar forcing). Across the two papers it [emerges that the
models overshoot historical warming from the near-surface through the
upper troposphere, in the tropics and globally]{.underline}." The study
based on 48 models for 1998 to 2014 found that they warm on average 4 to
5 times faster than the observations.

McKitrick concludes, "[modelling the climate is incredibly difficult,
and no one faults the scientific community for finding it a tough
problem to solve. But we are all living with the consequences of climate
modelers stubbornly using generation after generation of models that
exhibit too much surface and tropospheric warming, in addition to
running grossly exaggerated forcing scenarios]{.underline} (eg RCP8.5).

"\[W\]hen the [models get the tropical troposphere wrong, it drives
potential errors in many other features of the model atmosphere. Even if
the original problem was confined to excess warming in the tropical
mid-troposphere, it has now expanded into a more pervasive warm bias
throughout the global troposphere.]{.underline}

"If the [discrepancies in the troposphere were evenly split across
models between excess warming and cooling we could chalk it up to noise
and uncertainty. But that is not the case: it's all excess warming....
That's bias, not uncertainty, and until the modelling community finds a
way to fix it, the economics and policy making community are justified
in assuming future warming projects are overstated, potentially by a
great deal...."]{.underline}

The [strong upward bias in temperature forecasts relative to
observations compromise the models' forecasting impacts on ecosystems,
including agriculture, by exaggerating the probability of catastrophic
effects.]{.underline}

### Extension -- threat exaggeration 

#### Political and practical causes to threat exaggeration to mobilize action 

**Wade,** professor of Global Political Economy at London School of
Economics, **21**

\[Robert,"What is the Harm in Forecasting Catastrophe due to Man-Made
Global Warming?",7/22/21,

HDCSW-KGrid 7/15/25\]

The second IPCC [problem is that this bias to doomsday
forecasts]{.underline} -- therefore [to urgent and far-reaching action
\-- is intensified in the process of translating from the technical
reports to the summaries for policy makers.]{.underline} The translation
-- done mostly by non-scientists \-- tends to downplay uncertainties and
up-play certainties in an alarming, even catastrophizing direction.
Hence the tendency to treat worst-case scenarios as likely scenarios.
Recall the subtitle to the Nature paper, "[Stop using the worst-case
scenario for climate warming as the most likely outcome"
(2020).]{.underline}

3\. Logic of decision-making and logic of mobilization

The [tendency to treat worst-case scenarios as likely scenarios "in the
absence of radical changes to how we live, work and govern" can be
understood in terms of the distinction between the logic of
decision-making and the logic of mobilization or action.]{.underline} To
make the best decision about what to do, [one needs to explore a range
of possible alternative courses of action, weigh up the pros and cons of
each, then decide which is best]{.underline}. But having [exposed many
people to a range of options, there may be action-sapping disagreement
as to which is best.]{.underline} To get a great mass of people to move
all in one direction one needs to present them with only two
alternatives, one of which is crazy, and pretend to be entirely
confident of the two outcomes. (7) If they can be convinced that there
are only two alternatives and one is crazy, they will follow.

The [Climate Change Consensus expresses the logic of mobilization. It
presents two alternatives. "Do nothing (or little)", which leads to
catastrophe, extinction, the planet becomes ungovernable, coastal cities
must be abandoned]{.underline}, lower Manhattan will be underwater by
2018. Or else, [quickly decarbonize the world economy and push towards a
broader dematerialization of lifeways]{.underline}. No prizes for
guessing which wins. This is [how you mobilize people on a vast scale to
do what you think must be done. Or as a US senator from the West once
put it, "Managing politicians is like herding wild horses. To get them
running in the same direction you have to stampede them]{.underline}."
(8)

4\. Left and right politics

While the [demand for negatively-inflected news cuts across the
political spectrum, political ideology certainly shapes people's beliefs
about climate. Climate change "scepticism" is almost a talisman of the
center-right and right, and is strongly promoted by fossil fuel
interests]{.underline}. Climate "[alarmism" is more pronounced on the
center-left and left of the ideological spectrum]{.underline}. It is
promoted as a sacred unifying mission by a great global phalanx of
left-green civic action organizations (Extinction Rebellion is
prominent).

**Current studies overexaggerate climate change, not existential, and
the worst-case scenario is unlikely to happen.**

**Bailey, science correspondent at Reason, 25**

Ronald Bailey, "Worst-Case Climate Change Scenarios Are Highly
Implausible, Argues New Study", Reason, Feb. 9, 2022,
https://reason.com/2022/02/09/worst-case-climate-change-scenarios-are-highly-implausible-argues-new-study/
July 15 2025 HDCSW - A. Chung

Back in the bad old days of the 2010s, folks like David Wallace-Wells,
author of The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming (2019) warned,
\"The UN says we\'re on track to get to about 4 degrees or 4.3 degrees
of warming by the end of the century if we continue as we are.\" Or you
may remember author Gaia Vince asserting in 2019 in The Guardian that
\"experts agree that global heating of 4C by 2100 is a real
possibility.\"

[Before rushing to kit out your climate prepper bunker, you might want
to take a look at the new study by University of Colorado climate change
policy researcher Roger Pielke that confirms what the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change found in August 2021, namely that the
**worst**-case climate scenario is **increasingly** **unlikely**, and
that while our future will be **warmer**, it will **not** be
**catastrophically** so.]{.underline}

These dire predictions were based on calculations derived from a
scenario of the future in which fossil fuel and agricultural emissions
over the course of this century would boost atmospheric carbon dioxide
to nearly 1,400 parts per million (ppm) by 2100. The current level of
atmospheric carbon dioxide is just under 420 ppm, and that is up from
the pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm. Largely as a result of this
increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, global
average temperature has risen to around 1.1°C above the pre-industrial
level.

[Climate researchers labeled this worst-case scenario \"RCP8.5,\" and it
has been somewhat updated in the new Intergovernmental Panel of Climate
Change\'s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) on the physical science
basis of climate change and given a new moniker of
SSP5-8.5.]{.underline}

[The IPCC\'s AR6 report, released in August 2021, now acknowledges that
\"the likelihood of high emission scenarios such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5
is considered **low** in **light** of **recent** **developments** in the
energy sector.\"]{.underline}

The recent developments in the energy sector to which the AR6 report
refers are that fossil fuel usage is likely to be fairly flat for the
next 50 years. One of the main ways that the RCP8.5 scenario goes off
the rails of plausibility is that it projects a six-fold rise in global
coal consumption per capita by 2100. Since future coal consumption is
likely to remain flat or decline, that means that global carbon dioxide
emissions will be \"approximately in line with the medium RCP4.5, RCP6.0
and SSP2-4.5 scenarios.\"

[For some years now, University of Colorado climate change policy
researcher Roger Pielke, Jr., and his colleagues have been pointing out
that the development of the global economy is highly **unlikely** to
trace the high emissions pathways that led to the **worst**
**projected** **outcomes**. Nevertheless, climate studies based on the
RCP8.5 scenario are the ones being relied upon by people making their
predictions of dire climate **calamity** by the end of this
**century**.]{.underline}

Pielke and his colleagues have published a new study in the journal
Environmental Research Letters that argues that these intermediate
emissions scenarios are much more plausible than the high end scenarios
that engendered fears of climate catastrophe. \"These scenarios project
between 2 and 3 degrees C of warming by 2100, with a median of 2.2
degrees C,\" they conclude. They do, however, acknowledge that \"these
scenarios also indicate that the world is still off track from limiting
21st-century warming to 1.5 or below 2 degrees C.\"

These new calculations are based on the future energy use and energy
policy projections found in the International Energy Agency\'s latest
World Energy Outlook report. That report concludes that, instead of
rising six-fold, global coal consumption will peak during this decade.
On the other hand, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects
that world coal consumption will continue to rise slightly through 2050,
but that\'s still far from the sixfold increase entailed in the RCP8.5
scenario.

To assess plausibility of most of the IPCC scenarios, Pielke and his
colleagues ask which of the scenarios have projected carbon dioxide
emissions growth errors and divergences of less than 0.1 or 0.3 percent
per year over the observed growth rates between 2005 and 2020. That is,
which scenarios tracked what actually happened with carbon dioxide
emissions over the last fifteen years? Next they further parse how well
the scenarios similarly track actual emissions beginning in 2005 through
the IEA\'s projections of future emissions to 2050.

The chart above displays the plausibility of the various IPCC emissions
scenarios by tracking how well they match likely cumulative emissions of
carbon dioxide over the course of this century. The scenarios that
closely track actual and projected IEA emissions are marked with blue
dots (0.1 percent) and triangles (0.3 percent). \"All of the plausible
scenarios,\" explains Pielke in his Substack newsletter The Honest
Broker, \"envision less than 3 degrees Celsius total warming by 2100.
[In fact, the median projection is for 2100 warming of 2.2 degrees
Celsius.\" He adds that that \"is within spitting distance of the Paris
Agreement **goal** of **holding** temperatures to a warming of 2.0
degrees Celsius.\"]{.underline}

[Under the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, signatories committed to
\"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
levels.\"]{.underline}

[So man-made global warming of 4°C by 2100 above pre-industrial levels
is **not** a real **possibility**.]{.underline}

[\"Is the world ready for good news on climate?,\" asks Pielke. **Yes**,
we are.]{.underline}

CLIMATE TRENDS

[Beyond exhibiting extreme **overconfidence** in a cherry-picked
analysis of climate-change causes, politicians and activists frequently
ground their **alarmism** in frightening predictions about consequences
that are likewise **far** **from** **certain**.]{.underline} This is not
only true within the very new (and still quite unreliable) field of
predictive climate science; it is true even in the context of ongoing
climate phenomena. [Indeed, politicians and journalists frequently
characterize dramatic or unusual climate phenomena as the product of
**anthropogenic** climate change, yet there is **little** **evidence**
to **support** those claims.]{.underline}

For one thing, there is no observable upward trend in the number of
"hot" days between 1895 and 2017; 11 of the 12 years with the highest
number of such days occurred before 1960. Since 2005, NOAA has
maintained the U.S. Climate Reference Network, comprising 114
meticulously maintained temperature stations spaced more or less
uniformly across the lower 48 states, along with 21 stations in Alaska
and two stations in Hawaii. They are placed to avoid heat-island effects
and other such distortions as much as possible. [The reported data show
no **increase** in **average** temperatures over the available 2005-2020
period.]{.underline} In addition, a recent reconstruction of global
temperatures over the past 1 million years --- created using data from
ice-sheet formations --- [shows that there is **nothing** **unusual**
about the current warm period.]{.underline}

[Rising sea levels are another frequently cited example of impending
climate crisis. And yet sea levels have been **rising** **since** at
least the mid-19th century. This rise is tied closely with the end of
the Little Ice Age that **occurred** **not** **long** **before**, which
led to a rise in global temperatures, some **melting** of sea ice, and a
thermal **expansion** of sea water. There is some evidence showing an
**acceleration** in sea-level rise beginning in the early
1990s:]{.underline} Satellite measurements of sea levels began in 1992
and show a sea-level rise of about 3.2 millimeters per year between 1993
and 2010. Before 1992, when sea levels were measured with tidal gauges,
the data showed an increase of about 1.7 millimeters per year on average
from 1901 to 1990.

[But because the datasets are from two **different**
sources --- satellite measurements versus tidal gauges --- they are
**not** directly **comparable**, and therefore they **cannot** be
**interpreted** as showing an acceleration in sea-level
rises.]{.underline} Moreover, the period beginning in 1993 is short in
terms of global climate phenomena. [Since sea levels have risen at a
constant rate, remained constant, or even fallen during similar
relatively short periods, **inferences** **drawn** from them are
**problematic**.]{.underline} It is of course possible there has been an
acceleration in sea-level rise, but even still, it would not be clear
whether such a development stemmed primarily from anthropogenic or
natural causes; clearly, both processes are relevant.

A study of changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice yields very different
inferences. Since 1979, Arctic sea ice has declined relative to the
30-year average (again, the degree to which this is the result of
anthropogenic factors is not known). Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice has
been growing relative to the 30-year average, and the global sea-ice
total has remained roughly constant since 1979.

[Extreme weather occurrences are **likewise** used as evidence of an
ongoing climate crisis,]{.underline} but again, a study of the available
data undercuts that assessment. U.S. tornado activity shows either no
increase or a downward trend since 1954. [Data on tropical storms,
hurricanes, and accumulated cyclone energy (a wind-speed index measuring
the overall strength of a given hurricane season) reveal **little**
**change** since satellite measurements of the phenomena began in the
early 1970s. The number of wildfires in the United States shows **no**
**upward** **trend** since 1985, and global acreage burned has declined
over past decades.]{.underline} The Palmer Drought Severity Index shows
no trend since 1895. And the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, published
in 2014, displays substantial divergence between its discussion of the
historical evidence on droughts and the projections on future droughts
yielded by its climate models. [Simply put, the available data do not
support the ubiquitous assertions about the causal link between
greenhouse-gas accumulation, **temperature** **change**, and extreme
weather events and conditions.]{.underline}

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- [climate catastrophists will
often turn to **dire** **predictions** about prospective climate
phenomena.]{.underline} The problem with such predictions is that they
are almost always generated by climate models driven by highly complex
sets of assumptions about which there is significant dispute. [Worse,
these models are **notorious** for **failing** to **accurately**
**predict** already documented changes in climate.]{.underline} As
climatologist Patrick Michaels of the Competitive Enterprise Institute
notes:

During all periods from 10 years (2006-2015) to 65 (1951-2015) years in
length, the observed temperature trend lies in the lower half of the
collection of climate model simulations, and for several periods it lies
very close (or even below) the 2.5th percentile of all the model runs.
[Over shorter periods, such as the last two decades, a plethora of
mechanisms have been put forth to explain the observed/modeled
divergence, but **none** do so **completely** and many of the
**explanations** are **inconsistent** with each other.]{.underline}

We applied a rights-based approach to Indigenous Peoples' rights in the
context of a just transition, and, based on our analysis, posited that
such an approach is also valuable for helping governments and companies
play their part in creating a green transition that upholds those rights
in the spirit of justice for Indigenous Peoples. Under the UNGPs[,
businesses are responsible for respecting human rights, even when states
fail in their duty to protect them. Consequently, the effectiveness of
this rights-based approach largely depends on companies' knowledge,
understanding and unbiased support of Indigenous rights, regardless of
the level of state protection.]{.underline} As the cases discussed here
demonstrate, among other things, this [requires that companies ensure
meaningful and adequate involvement of Indigenous Peoples throughout the
process and uphold their rights.]{.underline} We propose that the
rights-based approach to just transitions be used as an analytical lens
for assessing responsible business behaviour and ensuring the rights of
Indigenous Peoples. It allows communities and activists to claim
fairness and inclusivity in the green transition and business and
government actors to operationalize the notion of justice. Moreover, it
may provide an analytical lens for scholars and civil society groups to
assess the congruence between strategies and policies supporting the
green transition and aims to promote justice.

### \*\*offense v climate\*\*

### Turn---Mitigation Leads to Short-Term Warming

#### No solvency and turn---mitigating emissions worsens the climate in the short term---and aerosol decline inevitably causes warming

[Scientists have uncovered a **potentially lethal paradox** at the heart
of efforts to slow human-caused climate change.]{.underline}

[A series of new studies suggest a stark truth.]{.underline}

[One the one hand, cutting fossil fuel pollution is necessary for
avoiding severe destruction]{.underline} over the long term. **[But such
cuts will make the earth much hotter in the short term.]{.underline}**

One recent study cast [the well-known declines in air pollution during
the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline} in a darker light.

These cuts [remain one of the only examples of successful cuts to
climate-warming pollution, but the new study found that **those
pandemic-era cuts in air pollution led to a rise in global
temperatures**.]{.underline}

The findings, published on Wednesday in the journal NPJ Climate and
Atmospheric Science, unveil a stark paradox at the heart of human-caused
climate change.

It suggests that [while cutting fossil fuel pollution is necessary for
avoiding severe destruction over the long term --- **such cuts will make
things noticeably worse in the short term.**]{.underline}

The pandemic-era economic slowdown led to "a large-scale geophysical
experiment," study leader Örjan Gustafsson of Stockholm University said
in a statement.

That's because the shuttered factories and power plants led to a
corresponding crash in emissions.

Even so, not all emissions fell in the same way.

From a research station in the Maldives, an island archipelago off the
coast of India, Gustafsson's team detected that when pollution from
smokestacks fell, so did concentrations of aerosols --- tiny floating
particles that hang in the atmosphere.

That fall was an unmistakable boon to public health. According to Our
World in Data, these contaminants --- like tiny floating particles of
soot or sulfates --- cause millions of global deaths per year.

[But for all the damage they do to human lungs, aerosols also help shade
the earth by scattering light particles from the sun that would
otherwise warm the planet.]{.underline}

After the cuts, the study found that light reaching the surface
increased by 7 percent.

["While the sky became bluer and the air cleaner, climate warming
increased when these cooling air particles were removed,"]{.underline}
Gustafsson said.

[While aerosol concentrations fell as the smokestacks shut off, other
gases remained stubbornly high.]{.underline}

[In particular, levels of the most potent climate-warming gases --- like
carbon dioxide --- barely changed.]{.underline}

Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases warm the planet by trapping
heat. The combination of more heat hitting the same amount of carbon
dioxide meant a straightforward rise in temperatures.

The sudden rise in temperatures led by the pandemic reduction is a stark
example of a more general problem --- one that has long haunted the
drive to cut pollution.

A draft study led by Columbia University climate scientist James Hansen
suggests that [the recent rise in temperatures doesn't come from
greenhouse gases at all, **but from the reduction in sulfate aerosols
since the early-2000s.**]{.underline}

[Hansen]{.underline} has an esteemed pedigree on this issue. He [is the
former NASA scientist who in 1988 warned Congress about the dangers
posed by burning fossil fuels]{.underline}, which he explained were
causing climate change by releasing carbon dioxide.

**[But by 2021, Hansen was troubled: the Earth was warming too
fast.]{.underline}**

In part, that was because the U.S. and world governments had largely
ignored his calls to cut carbon emissions. Atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels increased by more than 40 percent between 1990 and 2021.

But [even that surge in carbon dioxide levels wasn't enough to account
for how fast the climate was warming]{.underline}, Hansen and fellow
scientist Makiko Sato warned in 2021.

"Something is going on in addition to greenhouse warming," they wrote.

Their culprit: The fact that the **[immediate aerosols released by
fossil fuels temporarily hid their worse impacts, meaning that cutting
them would make things worse before it made them better.]{.underline}**

The two warned that [declines in aerosols could lead the rate of global
warming to double by 2040.]{.underline}

3 Unconscious Effects of Mortality Salience

[[Talking about climate change]{.mark} brings up feelings of
helplessness and despair]{.underline} (Norgaard 2011: loc 881), [which
[leads to apathy]{.mark} and repression of awareness of environmental
problems.]{.underline} As deep ecologist Joanna Macy (1983) recognized,
[apathy is a [defensive response to feeling pain from environmental
awareness]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Greek root apatheia means
["refusal]{.underline} or inability [to experience pain"]{.underline}
(Norgaard 2011: loc 903), which psychotherapist Shierry Nicholsen
describes [as a normal defensive response to feeling
overwhelmed]{.underline} (Norgaard 2011: loc 904). [[People block out
awareness of climate change and other threats to protect their
worldviews]{.mark}, shield themselves from fear and grief, and maintain
their sense of self-worth]{.underline} (Norgaard 2011: loc 1355--1356).

Unfortunately, [a great deal of media reporting and [environmental
discourse]{.mark} [uses fear]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [rhetorical
strategy]{.mark}. Sensationalistic headlines and news stories grab
consumer attention]{.underline} (O'Neill and Nicholson-Cole 2009:359).
O'Neill and Nicholson-Cole's qualitative empirical study finds that
[[images arousing fear raise awareness]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} [do not
promote pro-environmental behaviour]{.mark}. People become desensitized
over time, and [apathy sets in regarding things]{.mark} that [individual
action cannot remedy]{.mark}]{.underline} (O'Neill and Nicholson-Cole
2009:363). [People find nonthreatening images most inspiring for
themselves, yet still suggest using images inspiring fear to motivate
others]{.underline} (O'Neill and Nicholson-Cole 2009:369). [The [scary
images]{.mark} [that make climate change seem most
important]{.mark}]{.underline} (images of starvation and famine, e.g.)
[[are]{.mark} some of the ones that are [least likely to make people
feel like they can do anything about it]{.mark}]{.underline} (O'Neill
and Nicholson-Cole 2009:373).

The [[fear of death activates value defense]{.mark}.]{.underline} A
growing body of research in terror management theory demonstrates the
significance of mortality salience on behaviour (Burke et al. 2010,
Solomon et al. 2015). Social psychologists Jeff Greenberg, Tom
Pyszczynski, and Sheldon Solomon (1986) developed terror management
theory to test cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker's (1962, 1973)
ideas about mortality and existential anxiety. [Terror management theory
explains how thoughts of death and challenges to one's world view
[create]{.mark} a [sense of]{.mark} [threat to one's self-esteem by
endangering]{.mark} the [system in which self-worth is vested.]{.mark}
More than 500 studies have now empirically tested the psychological
effects of mortality salience]{.underline} (Solomon et al. 2015: 211).
[Making people aware of the fact we are going to die in modern
industrial society usually prompts us to consume]{.underline} (Arndt et
al. 2004). [The [dominant worldview]{.mark} [of modernity is
consumerism]{.mark}]{.underline}, so [[when we are
reminded]{.underline}]{.mark} of the fact [[we are going to die this
unconsciously makes us want to defend our worldview of consumerism by
buying things]{.mark}. The [resulting overconsumption is
counterproductive in]{.mark}]{.underline} terms of [[promoting
pro-environmental]{.mark} [behaviour]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## Arctic council 

#### Arctic Council integration of indigenous groups now -- integrates indigenous knowledge

 3.2.2. Ottawa traditional/indigenous knowledge principles

 Through discussions amongst experts nominated by the six Indigenous
Peoples Organizations being Permanent Participants to the Arctic
Council, the Ottawa Traditional Knowledge Principles was collectively
adopted in 2014. The principles were updated as Ottawa Indigenous
Knowledge Principles in 2018. The transition from "[Traditional
Knowledge" to "Indigenous Knowledge" in the articulations of the Arctic
Council underscores a paradigm shift towards **recognizing the
sovereignty and the distinct status of indigenous wisdom**. Principle 1
enshrines the use of Indigenous knowledge as an "overarching mandate of
the Arctic Council,]{.underline}" [**setting the stage for inclusive and
integrative approaches to Arctic policy-making and
researc**h.]{.underline} Principle 2 [advocates the "holistic and shared
understanding of the Arctic environment]{.underline}", [acknowledging
that indigenous perspectives offer a comprehensive worldview that is
vital in grasping the complexities of Arctic ecosystems]{.underline}.
Under Article 3, the "[meaningful and effective inclusion of Indigenous
knowledge" is not simply a tokenistic nod but demands a participatory
approach where indigenous voices are central to decision-making
processes]{.underline}. [The Arctic Council commits to the inclusion,
use, review, and verification of Indigenous Knowledge "at all stages of
every agreed-to initiative" in Principle 4, ensuring that indigenous
wisdom is not just consulted but is instrumental in shaping
outcomes.]{.underline} Following this approach, Principle 5 demands to
respect "the intellectual property of the indigenous knowledge holders",
safeguarding their rights and acknowledging their contributions.

[Environmental Impact of Arctic Drilling Arctic drilling, while offering
potential economic gains, presents significant environmental
risks]{.underline}. [The delicate balance of the Arctic ecosystem means
that even small disruptions can have far-reaching
consequences]{.underline}. It\'s a tough balancing act, trying to get
resources while protecting a unique environment.Ecosystem Disruption
Arctic ecosystems are incredibly sensitive. [Drilling activities can
directly destroy habitats, disrupt migration patterns, and affect the
food chain]{.underline}. For example, [the construction of roads and
drilling sites can fragment habitat]{.underline}s, making it harder for
animals to find food and mates. Noise pollution from drilling can also
disturb marine mammals, affecting their ability to communicate and
navigate. We need to think about the long-term effects on
wildlife.Pollution Risks [Pollution is a major concern. Oil spills,
chemical leaks, and waste disposal can contaminate the land, water, and
air]{.underline}. [These pollutants can harm wildlife, damage
ecosystems, and even affect human health]{.underline}. [The cold
temperatures in the Arctic slow down the natural breakdown of
pollutants, meaning that contamination can persist for a long
time.]{.underline} It\'s not just about preventing spills; it\'s about
having effective cleanup plans in place.Climate Change Concerns Arctic
drilling contributes to climate change. [The burning of fossil fuels
releases greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause
the planet to warm. The Arctic is particularly vulnerable to climate
change, with rising temperatures leading to melting ice and thawing
permafrost.]{.underline} This thawing releases even more greenhouse
gases, creating a feedback loop that accelerates warming. We need to
consider the [[long-term climate
impact]{.underline}](https://www.platinumdiamonddrilling.ca/post/environmental-impact-of-exploration-diamond-drilling)
of these projects.
