How does [the U.S. discourse **shape** the **human
security**]{.underline} [of the inhabitants]{.underline} of Alaska and
Greenland? In short, [the U.S. discourse shapes human security because
this aspect is not prioritized in the Arctic, as the actions of the U.S.
do not actually follow the Arctic Policy strategy]{.underline}. It is
clear that the human security of U.S. Arctic inhabitants is accorded
more importance than that of the Greenlanders, suggesting that other
Arctic states should be wary of cooperating with the U.S., as human
security is an afterthought for the U.S.'s Arctic interests.

The [discourse analysis of the U.S. Arctic Policies and U.S. political
actors' discourse showed that the U.S.'s Arctic interests continue to
align with its **historical neocolonialist ambitions to establish a
presence and maintain itself as a key actor and decision-maker in the
Arctic region**]{.underline}, [especially during the geopolitical
tensions and military security issues that arose in 2022]{.underline}.
[The U.S. also utilizes **capitalistic economic
opportunism**]{.underline} [to gain **decision-making power**
and]{.underline} [dominance in the Arctic]{.underline}
[region]{.underline}. [We saw this through its **Arctic investment
plans**]{.underline}, **[infrastructure developments]{.underline}**, and
**[natural resource extraction projects]{.underline}** [in both Alaska
and Greenland]{.underline}. By approaching this in a neocolonialist and
capitalist manner, it is evident that human security issues will arise
due to the vulnerability and dependence of smaller entities when larger
states possess this kind of power and influence. The **[qualitative
research showed]{.underline}** [that the U.S. is most interested in
**furthering its economic and military security**]{.underline}, [and
this shone **consistently** through in **every statement of this
analysis**]{.underline}. [There was with **little to no interest** in or
action taken **concerning the environment**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} [the inclusion of **Arctic Indigenous
peoples**,]{.underline} although these aspects were prioritized in the
U.S. Arctic Policies from 2009 to the beginning of 2023. The
**[discourse analysis]{.underline}** also [indicates that the U.S.
Arctic Policies are more like **domestic policies** than **foreign
policies**]{.underline}, [considering the **lack of an agenda to
cooperate** and **establish international goals in the Arctic
region**]{.underline}, [whilst simultaneously **excluding other Arctic
inhabitants**]{.underline}. Additionally, [the discourse analysis
suggests that the U.S. has always and will continue to **prioritize and
act according to its own interests**, specifically in **hard security
measures**, with soft security being mentioned in an **attempt to save
face,** nevertheless, will a **failure to focus on it.**]{.underline}

As discussed, the U.S.'s interests in the Arctic are deeper than its
rhetorical pronouncements. [The U.S. utilizes its Arctic Policy as **a
face-saving tactic**]{.underline} to **[draw a curtain]{.underline}**
[over its **neocolonial ambitions** and **capitalistic
behaviors**]{.underline} in [the Arctic region, suggesting that the U.S.
is more]{.underline} [of an **Arctic adversary than Arctic
ally**]{.underline}. [To conclude, I recommend being wary of U.S. Arctic
Policy rhetoric, as U.S. political actors' discourse reveals the U.S.'s
actual Arctic interests, exposing what is **hidden beneath the tip of
the iceberg.**]{.underline}

#### Their rhetoric makes [perpetual insecurity]{.underline} inevitable.

While some hold that the growing rhetoric of confrontation between
Russia and the West can be employed without running the risk of war
(Lieven 2018), I take this use of words seriously. Political
[**language** serves to make some courses of action **legitimate** and
**logical**, while precluding others]{.underline} (Hansen 2006, 21;
Jackson 2006; Wilhelmsen 2017). [According to this fundamental
discourse-theoretical insight, **securitization**]{.underline}---defined
as a process where the other is increasingly cast as different and
dangerous to the self---[will **manifest itself** in concrete policy
practices]{.underline} (Hagmann 2015, 9; Hayes 2009, 985; Wilhelmsen
2017, 28--29). Thus, [there is a link between the]{.underline}
**[rhetoric of confrontation]{.underline}** [that produces the
subjectivities of **threatened self** and **threatening
other**]{.underline}, [and the policy **responses
initiated**]{.underline} [in the course of such a
securitization]{.underline}.6 [The more different and dangerous to the
self the other is construed as being, perhaps even to the level of
"**existential threat**]{.underline}," [the more
**reasonable**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[logical will the use of
force]{.underline}** [against this other appear]{.underline} (Bandura
1990, 7--8; Wilhelmsen 2017, 24--26). Securitization, viewed through a
discourse-theoretical lens, emerges through a plethora of utterings and
is, therefore, best theorized as a gradual process, not one specific
happening (Ciuta 2009; Hagmann 2015, 21--22; Wilhelmsen 2017, 21--24).
That is not to say that securitizations cannot end up in a radical
black/white juxtaposition, where They represent an existential threat to
US and can be related to only through the barrel of a gun. Indeed, the
aim of this article is precisely to show how the gradual and increasing
securitization of Russia in Norway, and of Norway in Russia, is bringing
relations to a point where the threat of hostilities seems imminent. But
there is no necessary evolution to this point of possible destruction:
it is a contingent process (Guzzini 2011). [When securitization is
produced through a myriad of statements that together make the other
**stand out** as a **threat**]{.underline}, [there is always a
possibility for more and more statements that construe the other as
"**defensive**" or]{.underline} even "potential partner" to feed into
the process, bringing the threat image a few levels down and making
possible a policy of restraint or even collaboration. Here, however, I
seek to identify mechanisms that push securitization upward to the point
where the buildup of force seems necessary and hostilities imminent. My
first suggestion is to conceptualize and study securitization processes
in dyads, that is, as a mutual process. The shift to more radical
representations of the other (a higher degree of securitization) often
occurs in a reciprocal pattern of identification and interaction between
political entities (Wilhelmsen 2020, 30). How political entities such as
states identify, talk to (or about) each other, and the policies they
launch in accordance with and following such speech, play into and shape
the speech and policy courses of other states. [There are essential
**effects** of securitization processes where the other **party is
cast** as **different** and **dangerous** to the self]{.underline}
(Wæver 1995; Buzan et al. 1998; Stritzel 2007; McDonald 2008; Hagmann
2015; Wilhelmsen 2016). [Within a dyad of political entities that
increasingly **identify the other** as a threat to the self, a
self-perpetuating logic sets in, with the two **securitizations**
fueling each other.]{.underline} Under what conditions and how does this
happen? As noted by Mitzen (2006) and others, states do seek not only
physical security, they also seek security of the self (ontological
security), mainly because agency requires a stable cognitive
environment.7 Particularly at a time of crisis states strive to create
continuous narratives of self (Steely 2008a; Zarakol 2010; Subotic
2016). [**Routinized security talk** and the projection of the other as
a threat delivers ontological security.]{.underline} [It creates **inner
cohesion**]{.underline} [in the referent group and the ability to
act]{.underline} (Wilhelmsen 2017, 27--32). This is because
representations of self and other are bound together, dependent on each
other. [Collective identities and the social groups they refer to are
constituted in relation to difference and maintained through the
**continued juxtaposition**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[drawing up
of boundaries]{.underline}** between self and other (Barth 1969;
Connolly 1991). However, securitizing the other for enteric use also
[creates a "securitization dilemma"]{.underline}---"[a difficult choice
where a securitizing move represents a **powerful**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[attractive opportunity]{.underline}** [for
political mobilization, but with the danger of **perverse** and
**unintended consequences**]{.underline}" (Van Rythoven (2019, 2). The
unintended consequences of securitization have been suggested to be of
several kinds: contextual, social, and temporal (Van Rythoven 2019, 10).
Within the social type of contingency, which concerns how an audience
can interpret a security claim in unexpected ways, much attention has
been given to situations in which a securitizing move can be rejected by
the audiences it is meant to mobilize (Wæver 1989,1; Collins 2014; Van
Rythoven 2019). Of particular relevance for relations between political
entities, but less investigated, is the unintended consequences that a
securitization within one political entity of another political entity
may have on that other political entity. To maintain ontological
security, actors must not only be able to assure themselves of who they
are (endogenously)---and protecting a continuous narrative of self
becomes particularly pressing in a time of crisis---but they also need
to be identified and recognized by others, and on their own preferred
terms (exogenously) (Steely 2008b, 51--52; Zarakol 2010, 3; Ringmar
2014). A securitizing actor\'s firm (but probably unconscious) attention
to ontological security and the domestic audience at a time of crisis
can communicate non-recognition to the other (foreign) audience. If both
parties in a dyad of political entities push securitization of the other
upward for enteric use but disregard how the other will interpret it, as
well as the non-recognition of the other party that such securitization
implies, a negative spiral sets in. For example, a securitization of
NATO as different and dangerous to Russia creates both inner cohesion in
the Russian polity and makes possible a policy of "military
modernization" and a posture of "defensive deterrence," but it can have
unintended consequences. It can be taken as a rejection of NATO\'s
self-constituted identity as a legitimate, reliable, security-seeking
actor and elicit a string of representations of Russia as different and
dangerous on the NATO side.8 Failure to be recognized by the other on
one\'s own preferred terms might not necessarily result in feelings of
inferiority and shame, triggering efforts to reconstruct one\'s own
identity, as Bially Mattern has suggested (2004, 12--13) or "progressive
change" of self to become like the other, as Ringmar (2014) holds. As
Lupovici (2012, 818) notes a collective actor that experiences
ontological threat can "redefine the situation in order to protect
identity." "Avoidance," he says, building on Giddens (1991, 188) "allows
an actor facing an ontological dissonance to revalidate its identity
rather than to change it or to change its behaviour." Lupovici explores
the strategy of avoidance in situations where dissonance is created
endogenously, between conflicting self-identifications and the responses
undertaken to offset threats to these self-identifications within one
political entity. Avoidance may play out differently when the
ontological dissonance emerges exogenously in a dyad of political
entities. To reduce the dissonance between the understanding of self and
the explicit identification of one\'s own political entity by the other
as being something different and dangerous, revalidation of own identity
can be achieved through externalization, by simply returning the
negative identification. This strategy is manifest as a clear pattern in
the texts by Norwegian/Western and Russian leaders studied below. It is
hardly surprising that a collective actor would respond to the
non-recognition implicit in being securitized with externalization in
the form of talking and hitting back instead of undertaking some form of
internal revision. Responding by mirroring the securitization of your
group by the other party can be rewarding in terms of delineating and
maintaining self-identity, particularly in a time of crisis. To restate
and return to the case in focus: the non-recognition implicit in
Russia\'s securitization of NATO can elicit highly antagonistic
representations of Russia from the NATO side, triggering another round
of representations and accusations from the Russian side, and so on.
Such a **[negative spiral of mutual representations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[accusations]{.underline}** [can be driven further
when the different non-military issue-areas in which **collective
political entities**]{.underline} [engage also become subject to
securitization. While relations between **such entities**]{.underline}
[usually take place on different international arenas addressing
different issue-areas]{.underline} and exhibit a mixed pattern of
friendly and hostile interaction (Jervis 2001, 37; Bially Mattern 2004),
they may become subject to patterned all-encompassing friendly or
hostile interaction. The latter, I propose, can happen when security
concerns take center-stage in relations, through a spillover from mutual
securitization in the military sphere into other arenas of potentially
neutral or friendly interaction, such as trade, culture, or even
diplomacy. In more scholarly terms, a [negative spiral in relations is
**intensified**]{.underline} [when the other is
securitized]{.underline}, i.e., [construed, **through
speech**]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} **[different]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[dangerous]{.underline}** [at every
encounter]{.underline}, and when every policy move in any issue-area is
represented as a tool in the hands of this threatening other. [Such
multifaceted securitization pushes the **representation**]{.underline}
[of the other **upward**]{.underline} [on the scale of difference and
danger and can create a situation where **positive
recognition**]{.underline} [is not granted **in any
sphere**]{.underline}. In this situation, the collective actor
experiences an exogenous rejection of its self-ascribed identity in
every policy sphere where it seeks outside confirmation---making the
experience acute. In turn, this experience of acute ontological
dissonance may be met by a strategy of avoidance and externalization: [a
counter-securitization that mirrors and matches the **near-total
rejection**]{.underline} [to which the political entity itself has been
subjected. In the course of the ensuing spat]{.underline}, with hostile
representations flung back and forth on every arena of encounter, the
other is finally left with no face but that of an enemy. That resolves
the dilemma of knowing what the intentions of the other are, as each
party is now quite certain that the other has offensive designs. From
this understanding, logically flow policies of positioning and armament
in the military sphere, and disengagement and non-communication in
non-military issue-areas. In contrast to endogenously generated
avoidance noted by Lupovici (2012, 813), the problem is not that a
collective actor undertakes contradictory measures to alleviate
ontological dissonance, but rather that the same measures of
disengagement and confrontation seem logical and legitimate in every
sphere of interaction between two political entities. In this situation,
the parties have few possibilities of extricating themselves from the
spiral that leads to confrontation. If the other is securitized and
denied recognition across issue-areas and arenas, that leaves no space
for responding with friendship to overcome mistrust---which would be the
opening through which to start pushing the spiral downward. [A high
level of]{.underline} mutual and multifaceted [securitization can
produce]{.underline}, in Jervis' terminology (2001, 41), [a]{.underline}
**["deep security dilemma]{.underline}**" \... "[a situation where
mistrust **cannot be overcome**]{.underline}" and where there are "no
missed opportunities for radically improving relations." But in contrast
to Jervis' conception, the road toward this high level of mutual
securitization, with the ensuing minimal trust, is gradual and
contingent, and produced through a plethora of representations.
Moreover, in this approach[, the key "mover" in the security
dilemma]{.underline}---the perception of each party that the other has
offensive intentions---[emerges from their **discursive practices**,
their **representations**]{.underline} [of each other]{.underline}.
[Mutual and multifaceted securitization]{.underline} answers Mitzen and
Schweller\'s (2011) [call to understand how **certainty**]{.underline}
[about the other actor\'s aggressive intentions can **contribute** to
the]{.underline} **[onset of war]{.underline}**.9 But this certainty,
with the tragic outcome it can result in, should not be seen as
conditioned by structural uncertainty at the outset; nor is the
misplaced certainty in the next phase built from "inside" an individual
decision-maker with reference to cognitive and affective causes (Mitzen
and Schweller\'s (2011; Jervis 1976, 387--406). I submit that it is
built through the multiple and spreading self/other representations that
bring the "offensive intent" of the other into being as a social
reality, making it reasonable and logical to undertake policy steps to
counter this aggressive intent.

#### Vote neg to reject the 1AC's propaganda machine\-\--securitization creates a stranglehold on civic education. Only rejecting fearmongering can prevent authoritarianism and empower a radical democracy.

"America's Descent Into Fascism Can Be Stopped".
<https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/11/08/americas-descent-into-fascism-can-be-stopped/>
HDCSW-Packet

The election of [Trump is **more than**]{.underline} a
**[political]{.underline}** event; [it is an attempt to legitimize a
brutal evolution of fascism in America]{.underline}. [His rise is not
**accidental** but symptomatic,]{.underline} emerging from the depths of
collective fear, dread, and anxiety stoked by a savage form of gangster
capitalism---neoliberalism---that thrives on division and despair. [This
climate, steeped in a culture of hate, misogyny, and racism, has given
life to Trump's authoritarian appeal, drowning out the warning signs of
past and present tyranny.]{.underline}

While it's clear that American society changed dramatically with
Reagan's election and the corrupt rise of the billionaire elite, we must
also recognize how liberals and the Democratic Party, instead of
resisting, aligned with Wall Street power brokers like Goldman Sachs. In
doing so, they adopted elements of neoliberalism that crushed the
working class, intensified the class and racial divide, accelerated
staggering levels of inequality, and intensified the long legacy of
nativism, all of which fed into the conditions for Trump's appeal.
Clinton's racially charged criminalizing policies, Obama's centrist
neoliberalism and unyielding support for the financial elite, and
Biden's death-driven support for genocide in Gaza have contributed to a
culture ripe for authoritarianism. In short, this groundwork didn't just
make Trump possible; it made him inevitable.

But perhaps [one of the most overlooked failures of
liberalism]{.underline} and Third Way democrats, [and even parts of the
left,]{.underline} **[was the neglect of education]{.underline}** [as a
form of **critical and civic literacy** and the role it plays in raising
**mass consciousness** and fostering an **energized collective
movement**]{.underline}. [This failure wasn't just about policy
but,]{.underline} as Pierre Bourdieu observed, [about forgetting that
domination operates not only through economic
**structures**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} also through beliefs and
**[cultural persuasion]{.underline}**. [Trump and his engineers of hate
and revenge have not only rewritten history but obliterated historical
consciousness as fundamental element of civic education.]{.underline}
Historical amnesia has always provided a cover for America's
long-standing racism, nativism, disavowal of women's right.
[Capitalizing on far right]{.underline} **[propaganda
machines]{.underline}**, Trump managed, as Ruth Ben-Ghiat notes, to
convince millions of Americans that they "simply could not accept the
idea of a non-White and female president." Nor could they insert
themselves in a history of collective struggle, resistance, and the
fight for a better world. He also convinced the majority of Americans
that it is okay elect a white supremacist to be the President of the
University.

Bernie Sanders rightly observes on X that "It comes as no great surprise
that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would
find that the working class has abandoned them." Of course, the
Democratic Party shares with mainstream media stenographers the fact
that they have refused to forcefully acknowledge, as Sherrilyn Ifill
points out, that not only the MAGA crowd but also "a majority of white
Americans in fact have chosen to embrace white supremacy rather than the
promise of a multi-racial democracy." Sanders' comments only scratch the
surface. The issue of abandonment and moral collapse also extends to the
pedagogical realm: for decades, the right has wielded the educational
force of culture to persuade white, Latino, and Black workers to turn
their backs on their own interests, binding them to an authoritarian
cult and white supremacist ideology that exploits their alienation and
sabotages any sense of critical agency. Since the 1970s, galvanized by
the Powell Memo, reactionary conservatives have grasped, far more than
the left, the transformative power of ideas. They have weaponized
culture to dismantle institutions that once nurtured critical thought,
education, and resistance. Recognizing that reshaping public
consciousness was essential to their agenda, they systematically eroded
critical literacy, attacked public spaces, and transformed public and
higher education from forces of liberation ---turning them into either
sites of repression and training or more disdainfully, full scale sites
of indoctrination. This was no accident; it was a core part of their
long-term strategy---to strip society of its capacity for dissent,
molding a populace more easily controlled, more willingly complicit in
its own subjugation.

[Trump is the grim culmination of this cultural war against reason,
truth, and **critical thinking**]{.underline}. [Mass ignorance and civic
illiteracy have become not mere byproducts but the very engines of a
strategy to blind working people and those considered expendable to the
economic injustices ravaging their lives]{.underline}. Rather than
addressing these economic onslaughts, they are instead lured into a
communal theater of hate and bigotry. This spectacle of manufactured
ignorance and call for [cult-like loyalty]{.underline} does more than
cloud the mind; it becomes a political weapon, rendering the
dispossessed both docile and divided. [Neoliberal ideology]{.underline}
intensifies this dynamic, **[imprisoning people in suffocating bubbles
of self-interest and hyper-individualism]{.underline}**. It [wages a
calculated assault on collective solidarity]{.underline}, [designed to
transform the public into isolated consumers, unable to envision a
politics beyond their private lives or recognize that their true power
lies in unity and critical consciousness]{.underline}. At the same time,
it takes advantage of the anxiety and loneliness experience by the
disposed to lure them into a false community of hatred and lawlessness.
The need for solidary falls prey under Trump into the lure of what Ernst
Bloch in The Principle of Hope called the swindle of fulfillment.

With no viable movement for meaningful social change in sight, Trump and
his modern-day Brownshirts exploited the void left by a crisis of
consciousness. Into this gap, they injected a corporate-controlled
culture that shaped daily life with a culture steeped in hatred, fear,
anxiety, and the force of endless fascist like spectacles. It is worth
noting that such spectacles are chillingly reminiscent of Nuremberg in
the 1930s, designed to stoke division and obedience, distracting the
public from any path toward collective resistance or liberation. This
carnival of divisiveness and dehumanizing rhetoric did more than destroy
the nation's civic and educational fabric, it produced a poisonous
populist culture that changed the way most Americans view the past,
present, and future.

[If we are to confront this **fascistic momentum**]{.underline}, [we
must urgently return to the tools necessary to rebuild a mass
consciousness as a precondition for a mass movement--one that can use
the mobilization of mass consciousness, strikes and other forms of
direct action to prevent this new fascist regime from governing. We need
to stop this machinery of death from enacting the enormous suffering,
misery, violence, and power that gives it both a sense of pleasure and
reason for enduring.]{.underline}

With Trump's rise to power, American citizens have empowered a fascist
agenda---one bent on enriching the ultra-wealthy, gutting the welfare
state, deporting millions, and dismantling the very institutions that
uphold accountability, critical thought, and democracy itself. These
structures are not just formalities; they are the lifeblood of a
radical, inclusive democracy and the safeguard for an informed
citizenry. In this perilous moment, Seyla Benhabib, drawing on Adorno
and Arendt, confronts us with a question of profound urgency: "What does
it mean to go on thinking?" Her call to "learn to think anew" resounds
with particular force as we grapple with the stark reality of Trump's
election.

We are now compelled to rethink the very foundations of culture,
politics, power, struggle, and education. The stakes are clear. In mere
weeks, as Will Bunch notes, a man who attempted to overturn an
election---who espouses overt racism, embraces white supremacy, and
boasts about his rancid misogyny, has pledged mass deportations, and
threatens military force against political opponents---will once again
assume power. This is a historical crossroads that demands a radical
reevaluation of our democratic commitments and strategies for real
social and economic change.

Chris Hedges aptly warns that "the American dream has become an American
nightmare \[and that\] Donald Trump is a symptom of our diseased
society. He is not its cause. He is what is vomited up out of decay."
Trump embodies the cumulative effects of decades of moral and social
corrosion. His presidency signals not a departure but an intensification
of a deep-seated national crisis.

In this historical moment[, we face an urgent challenge to confront and
dismantle the forces entrenching **fascist politics** and
**authoritarian governance**]{.underline}. [Now is the moment to
**radically transform**]{.underline} [our approach to **theory**,
**education**, and the **liberatory power of learning**---tools we must
wield to build a robust, multi-racial working-class movement that is
unapologetically anti-capitalist and unwaveringly
democratic]{.underline}. [We must relinquish the]{.underline} [myth of
**American exceptionalism**]{.underline} and the dangerous illusion that
democracy and capitalism are synonymous. The [cost of inaction is
**dire**: a future where democracy is not merely eroded but
**supplanted** by a **violent police state**,---a betrayal soaked in
blood, extinguishing the dream of a society committed to the promise and
ideals of **justice and equality**.]{.underline}

The **[stakes could not be higher]{.underline}**. [We must confront this
moment **with uncompromising purpose**, a blueprint for bold action,
and]{.underline} [an unyielding]{.underline} [commitment to a **radical
democracy**]{.underline} that defies fascist cruelty, bigotry, and the
stranglehold of the financial elite at every step. Our future demands
it, as does the vision of a society where **[justice]{.underline}**,
**[solidarity]{.underline}**, [and human dignity are not just ideals but
realities]{.underline}---[part of a future that defies the rising shadow
of fascism threatening to consume us]{.underline}. [We either fight to
reclaim this promise, or we **surrender to a darkness from which there
is no return**]{.underline}.

[Education is]{.underline} once again being **[ensnared]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} the **[suffocating chains of
instrumentalism]{.underline}**---a pedagogy that prioritizes rote
memorization, conformity, and rigid discipline over critical thinking
and creativity. This **[deadening rationality]{.underline}**, for
instance, [reduces pedagogy to teaching]{.underline} **[for the
test]{.underline}**, [stripping education of its transformative
potential]{.underline}. It [masquerades]{.underline} [as]{.underline} a
set of \"**[learning objectives]{.underline}**\" but too often turns the
classroom into little more than job training, producing consumers for a
market-driven world while reinforcing entrenched social inequalities.
While learning work skills is important, education must aspire to
something greater. It must cultivate informed, critical, and socially
responsible citizens---not just workers.

Simultaneously, equally [sinister forces]{.underline} are at play in the
current historical moment, seeking to [align education with]{.underline}
an **[authoritarian]{.underline}** **[agenda]{.underline}**. These
approaches promote a pedagogy of indoctrination that bans books, censors
history, suppresses academic freedom, and dismantles the labor
conditions that empower teachers and faculty. This authoritarian
pedagogy **[erodes solidarity]{.underline}**, [undermines the social
fabric, and advances an eviscerated notion of
**individualism**]{.underline}, **[competition]{.underline}**, [and the
degradation **of civic culture**]{.underline}. In the face of this
dangerous attack on education, progressives must advocate for rigorous,
interdisciplinary, and affirmative pedagogical practices that defend
democracy, foster community and solidarity, and connect learning with
social responsibility, compassion, and justice. We need an education
that links learning to meaningful social change, economic equity, and
social justice.

[Critical pedagogy]{.underline}, **[in contrast]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} the pedagogies of **[instrumentalism and
authoritarianism]{.underline}**, [illuminates]{.underline} the vital
relationship between knowledge, authority, and power. It [compels us to
ask]{.underline} crucial questions: **[Who controls the production of
knowledge]{.underline}**? **[Whose values dominate]{.underline}**?
**[Which social relations are being reinforced]{.underline}**? [Pedagogy
is inherently political because it is]{.underline} tied to the
acquisition of agency, revealing how knowledge and identities are
constructed within specific power dynamics. As Homi Bhabha insightfully
notes, pedagogy **[demands vigilance]{.underline}** at \"[that very
moment in which identities are being produced and groups are being
constituted]{.underline}.\" Under such circumstances, [pedagogy makes
clear how people can become responsible to themselves---which is a
crucial step towards self-representation, agency, and the ability to
narrate oneself from a position of power and agency. **Education is
never neutral**]{.underline}; [it is never removed from the dynamics of
power]{.underline}; [it shapes **how power circulates** through the
**construction of knowledge**, **identities**, and **authority** within
particular social relations.]{.underline}

Critical pedagogy envisions transformation and refuses the notion that
democracy and capitalism are synonymous. In this vision of education,
democratic values and human rights are crucial to what it means to
create informed citizens. Moreover, critical pedagogy is not content
with simply imparting knowledge; it empowers students to question,
challenge, and reimagine the world beyond the boundaries of \"common
sense," gangster capitalism, and the global machines of war and
staggering inequality. As a form of critical literacy, it "[it is not
merely about competence but is about intervention, the possibility of
interpretation as intervention, as interrogation, as relocation, as
revision.]{.underline}" It [teaches students to govern]{.underline}
themselves **[rather than to be governed]{.underline}**, [providing a
framework in which they can narrate their own lives. It bridges the gap
between the classroom and the real world, exposing the power dynamics
that govern society]{.underline}.

The transformative power of **[education is constantly under
siege]{.underline}**. [Critical education]{.underline} [cannot survive
if educators are stripped of their autonomy over their labor, teaching
practices, and the connection of their work to broader social
issues]{.underline}. [Critical pedagogy]{.underline} [poses a direct
threat to authoritarian forces because it redefines education as a
deeply **moral and political** endeavor]{.underline}, **[not a mere
technical exercise]{.underline}**. It [challenges the status
quo]{.underline} by [**exposing** the struggle over power]{.underline},
[values]{.underline}, [identities, and **competing visions** of the
present and future]{.underline}. [Right-wing and authoritarian
politicians fear this most]{.underline}: the [realization that education
**cannot be reduced to a set of rigid skills**]{.underline} designed to
turn classrooms into instruments of censorship, propaganda, and
indoctrination. This dangerous shift is already unfolding in states like
Florida, Texas, Idaho, and Tennessee, where education is being
weaponized to suppress dissent and critical thought.

[Critical pedagogy **extends far beyond the classroom**]{.underline},
[permeating all areas of social life and bridging the gap between
education and everyday experiences]{.underline}. It [confronts the
**entrenched power structures**]{.underline} that dictate what knowledge
is valued and whose interests are served, empowering students to
recognize and [**resist domination**]{.underline} in all its forms. By
[exposing]{.underline} the [dynamics of power and
authority]{.underline}, critical pedagogy [equips individuals with the
tools to act from a position of agency and engage in the struggle for a
more just and equitable society.]{.underline} This battle for justice,
however, is not limited to formal schooling. The broader
culture---through print, media, and entertainment---plays an equally
crucial role in shaping public consciousness. In a world where [power
manifests in economic, symbolic, and cultural forms, critical pedagogy
**becomes essential** for decoding the mechanisms of domination embedded
in cultural representations and social practices.]{.underline} It
provides both students and citizens with the critical awareness
necessary to challenge these forces and participate in the broader fight
for emancipation.

[The rise of authoritarianism]{.underline} [in Canada, the U.S., and
beyond underscores the **urgent need** to place education at the heart
of the struggle for critical thinking]{.underline}. We need young people
who will write themselves into the script of democracy, empowered to
resist authoritarian and anti-democratic ideologies. Democracy cannot
thrive without informed, engaged citizens, and critical pedagogy is
vital in cultivating the awareness and courage necessary to confront the
challenges of our time. It is the engine of individual and collective
agency, essential to a vibrant socialist democracy.

A truly democratic education prioritizes human needs over profit,
advocating for both economic and political rights while championing the
public good above private gain. It rejects narrow self-interest,
fostering a deep commitment to social responsibility and collective
action. Critical pedagogy is the language of empowerment and
transformation, unearthing the roots of injustice, confronting racism,
poverty, and war, and inspiring us to envision a more just future. In
the face of oppressive power, it reminds us that the fight for justice
is not only necessary but always possible. Whether through individual
acts or collective movements, public and higher education are essential
for creating spaces of democratic participation and meaningful social
change. What must be emphasized is that education is central to
reshaping consciousness, influencing how individuals perceive
themselves, others, and the broader world. Stuart Hall was right in
declaring that \"the left is in trouble\... if it has no sense of
politics being educative, of politics changing the way people see
things.\"

Ultimately, [critical pedagogy is **inseparable**]{.underline} [from the
larger battle for human rights and transformative]{.underline} [social
and economic justice]{.underline}. It is not just a framework for
education but a revolutionary force, igniting the fight against
oppression in all its forms. [Through this radical lens, education
becomes a **weapon** for dismantling systems of **exploitation**,
systemic **racism**, **militarism**, and **inequality**,]{.underline}
forging a path toward true democracy---one that empowers the many, not
the few. [It links the struggle for individual and collective rights to
the relentless pursuit of a just, liberated, and profoundly radical
social order]{.underline}.

We disagree with Holsti. We believe that [the field is now]{.underline}
much **[healthier]{.underline}** [because of the proliferation of
**theories**]{.underline}. Not only has this [resulted in a
**significant rethink**]{.underline} [about what the field consists
of]{.underline}, [it has also led to a **questioning** of
the]{.underline} **[main assumptions]{.underline}** [of the
**ontology**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[epistemology]{.underline}** of [the discipline]{.underline}. Together
[we see these developments as opening up space for much **more
debate**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, crucially, to [legitimize a
wider variety of theories]{.underline}. On the one hand, then, [the
range of theories allows us to think about more aspects of
**i**nternational **r**elations than before, and because they are often
based on epistemological positions]{.underline} **[far removed from
positivism]{.underline}** [they also allow us to]{.underline}
[reflect]{.underline} [on]{.underline} just **[how]{.underline}** [we
think about the world]{.underline}. This widening of theories has been
achieved in part by a [much closer engagement with other social
sciences, so that sociological or anthropological accounts of
international relations are every bit as worthy as conventional
political or economic accounts]{.underline}. We see this situation as
better than that of most of the last century, when one theory (realism)
dominated the discipline, and one view of knowledge construction
(positivism) reigned supreme. But, of course, there is no denying that
this plurality of approaches does raise some significant problems, most
obviously how to choose between theories.

What do theories share

Despite the very significant differences between the theories dealt with
in this book, it is important to note that they share three significant
assumptions. First, and chief among these, is [their shared commitment
to the importance of theory in understanding the world]{.underline}. In
direct contrast to those who see theory as irrelevant or optional, all
the authors in this book think that **[theory is central]{.underline}**
[to explaining **i**nternational]{.underline}
[**r**elations]{.underline}. [We need to stress the importance of this
assumption]{.underline}, since [many continue to believe that theory
merely **gets in the way**]{.underline} of understanding the world, [and
at worst is simply a way of making things more complicated than they
really are. In our view, the option of **non-theoretical accounts** of
the world is simply **not available**]{.underline}. [**All** observation
of international relations]{.underline} [has to be carried out in the
**language of some theory** or other.]{.underline} [The
choice]{.underline}, then, [is]{.underline} [one of whether you are
**aware of the assumptions** you are bringing to your study of the world
**or not**. Indeed, texts that begin by saying that they are **only
looking at 'the facts'** are theoretically laden]{.underline}: [this is
because what counts as 'the facts' is either something that is
**explicitly linked to a theory**, or is instead the result of powerful
and unstated assumptions]{.underline}.

### Security\-\--Framework\-\--AT: Clash

#### Opportunity cost focus is [bad]{.underline}\-\--Requiring an opportunity cost framework forces us into a problem-solving framework that ASSUMES variables that we critique are undeniably TRUE. Reject that premise.

[Opportunity costs]{.underline} can represent a significant portion of
the costs associated with conservation projects and [frequently
**outstrip** **other kinds of cost**]{.underline}. They are typically
understood to refer to the benefits someone would have obtained if
conservation projects had not required them to give up current
activities, such as farming or hunting or if the land had been available
for uses other than conservation. This familiar way of [identifying
opportunity costs]{.underline} **[is flawed]{.underline}**, however,
[because it]{.underline} threatens to **[condone]{.underline}**, [or
take advantage of]{.underline}, the **[injustices]{.underline}** [that
many people face that **affect** their **opportunities**]{.underline}. I
integrated ideas from the political theory of global justice to examine
how the analysis of opportunity costs illustrates the importance of
considering conservation and issues of global justice together, rather
than thinking about them in isolation. I distinguish four baselines for
defining opportunity costs. A status quo baseline defines opportunity
costs by asking what people would have earned had a conservation project
not happened. A willingness to accept baseline defines them by asking
people what it would take to make them indifferent to whether a
conservation project takes place or not. An antipoverty baseline
suggests that opportunity costs have been met when people affected by a
project are not left in poverty. An egalitarian baseline suggests
opportunity costs have been met when people are not left in relative
disadvantage, with worse than average opportunities. I argue that the
**[egalitarian baseline]{.underline}** i[s the most acceptable from the
point of view of justice.]{.underline} Such a baseline would suggest
that, in practice, many of [the world\'s poor are being **unjustly
treated**]{.underline}, or even exploited, as a result of conservation
activities.

As aforementioned, [the speech act]{.underline} [**is critical** to
securitization]{.underline} theory as it is required to begin the
process. [It involves both the actor and the object]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} more importantly, [the labelling as an **existential
threat**]{.underline}. [Speech is]{.underline} a
**[unique]{.underline}** [element of the securitization process in that
it assumes all individuals are active agents who can practice
security]{.underline}. As Buzan, Waever, and Wilde suggest, [speech
enables **any individual** to engage in the practice of security,
meaning that it is no longer just about states and that individuals can
practice as well.]{.underline} 9

**[New studies have shown]{.underline}** that the [speech act is about
**how** an issue is communicated,]{.underline} and since we communicate
in more ways than speech, it is also important to understand the ways in
which visuals such as images play a role in the intensification of the
securitization process. Both words and visuals [can create]{.underline}
a sense of **[unease]{.underline}**, **[estrangement]{.underline}**, and
**[securitization]{.underline}**, as well as [feelings of]{.underline}
**[fear]{.underline}**, **[anxiety]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[risk]{.underline}**. This is **[particularly relevant]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} the issue of [climate change and environmental
degradation]{.underline}, given that so many of the securitizing factors
recently involved have been through the use of imagery (i.e. An
Inconvenient Truth by Al Gore)..

This situation raises [the question of **the grounds** on which we make
a **choice between theories**]{.underline}. [For]{.underline} many new
[undergraduate]{.underline} [students of IR this is a major worry, since
they want to be guided to the 'right' answer]{.underline}. And, of
course, **[this is why realism has been so powerful,]{.underline}**
because [it]{.underline} explicitly [sees itself as the **best account**
of the persistence of inter-state war and competition]{.underline}. We
feel that there is much more at stake in answering this question. In my
view, the fi rst criterion involved in making a choice between theories
has to be the issues you wish to explain. Thus, if you are interested in
the future of the environment, it is likely that green theory will be as
good a place to start as any. That does not mean that only green theory
can offer explanations, but it does give the reader a place to start
their thinking about which is the most appropriate theory. It would be
tempting to leave the issue of theory choice here, since I could imply
that the theories in this book are all dealing with different, discrete,
aspects of the same world of international relations, and that [you
could adopt a kind of '**pick and mix'** attitude towards
theory.]{.underline} Accordingly [you might think it sensible to use,
say, green theory when discussing the environment, feminism when
discussing global gender inequalities, and structural realism when
looking at great power rivalry in the Asia--Pacific]{.underline}. But
**[though this might seem comforting]{.underline}**, **[I do not think
that this move is possible.]{.underline}** This is because the various
[theories]{.underline} **[are not like parts of a jigsaw]{.underline}**
[that can be neatly combined together with each explaining one part of
international relations]{.underline}. Rather I think that the
[theories]{.underline} in this book **[are like different coloured
lenses]{.underline}**: [if you put one of them in front of your
eyes]{.underline}, [you will see things differently]{.underline}. [Some
aspects of the world will look the same in some senses, for example
shapes, but many other features, such as light and shade of colour,
**will look very different**, so different in fact that **they seem to
show alternative worlds**.]{.underline}

In thinking about this you might like to visualize Martin Hollis's
excellent example of a mobile hanging over a child's bed, a metaphor he
regularly used in his teaching. The view that the various theories each
explain part of the world of international relations is akin to the view
that someone standing looking at the child's mobile will see the same
mobile as the child lying on the bed, albeit from different angles.
There is nothing incommensurable about their two perspectives; simple
geometric analysis can show how their different views of the mobile can
be combined together---they are just different views of the same mobile.
Yet Hollis always argued, persuasively in my view, that the social world
is not like this. The [theories]{.underline} [we use **cannot simply be
combined together**]{.underline} [so as to add up to different views of
the same world of international relations; instead, **they actually see
different worlds**]{.underline}. Thus [a Marxist writer, though they
will focus on power, will see a different form of powe]{.underline}r
(ultimately economic) [to that seen by a classical realist]{.underline}
(ultimately political). Similarly, [a classical liberal will not see
cooperation over environmental issues in anything like the same way as a
green theorist will see them]{.underline}. Finally, think of, say, [a
feminist writing about the global power structure, and compare it to a
neorealist account.]{.underline} It is not possible simply to add up
these various accounts of international relations to get one overarching
theory. [Theories are part of the social world]{.underline}, [they can
never be separate from]{.underline} [it, and thus they constitute the
social world in which we live]{.underline}. [Each defi nes the problems
to be examined differently]{.underline}, [and may well defi ne how we
know things about those problems in different ways.]{.underline} Thus
the social location of the observer will infl uence which theory they
see as most useful, simply because that location will predispose that
observer to defi ne some features of international relations as key and
others as less relevant.

### Security\-\--Link\-\--Disease

#### Disease securitization transforms public health into [biomedical realism]{.underline}\-\--that discourse undermines rights and elevates the nation state's concerns of collapse over health.

[Even if this need for security is comprehensible]{.underline}, [the
nature of the **security discourse**]{.underline} [in global health and
beyond raises **fundamental questions** and **concerns**.]{.underline}
[Instead of pursuing common objectives, such as social stability, global
public goods, equity or social justice, and recognizing shared
responsibilities by governments across national boundaries, security
policies predominantly envisage **biomedical threats** such as
infectious diseases]{.underline}, [more or less openly admitting that
the focus is on the autonomy of **nation states** and safeguarding the
**existing status quo** in international relations, **however unfair
they may be**]{.underline} \[4\]. The [utopian exuberance]{.underline}
that led to the founding of the WHO and other United Nations (UN)
organizations [is]{.underline} thus [giving way to a
pragmatic]{.underline}, [predominantly **biomedical
realism**]{.underline} [that **undermines**]{.underline} [rather than
promotes people's **rights and legal entitlements**,]{.underline} as
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the WHO
constitution \[5\].

The [SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the extent to which global and
public health has become dominated by **biomedical
approaches**]{.underline}. [Politicians]{.underline},
[policymakers]{.underline} and [the media]{.underline} [provided
virologists and epidemiologists a paramount role in dealing with the
pandemic]{.underline}. For a considerable time, they provided the main
evidence base for partly far-reaching measures and restrictions. The
strong, near-exclusive focus on biomedical sciences and their assessment
of the pandemic situation led to the initial ignorance of the
non-medical, social determination of health. In Germany, for example, it
took the dominant COVID-19 experts and political decisionmakers 14
months to even notice the pronounced socioeconomic differences in the
burden of the coronavirus infection \[6\].

[The ongoing debate about the COVID-19 pandemic and its interrelation
with health security does not sufficiently put the spotlight on the
structural causes of global health crise]{.underline}s. Despite
overwhelming evidence of the social determination of health, political
leaders, the media and an influential part of global health actors have
focused first and foremost on biomedical approaches \[7\], while often
underestimating or even ignoring the close relationship between
socioeconomic status, living conditions and unhealthy lifestyles on the
one hand, and both the burden of non-communicable diseases and the
severity and lethality of COVID-19 infections on the other \[8, 9\].

A narrative, iterative review of the available literature on health
security indicates an increasing biomedicalization of public health that
has contributed significantly to making the linkage between health and
security the priority discourse in global health and its governance.
Security aspects and considerations have gained both acceptance and
importance in the last decades. The quest for security is understandable
in an increasingly inequitable, unstable and disjointed world,
particularly vis-à-vis the militarization of confects and international
relations. But a closer look at the concept of **[health
security]{.underline}** [makes things appear more
**complicated**]{.underline}. It often remains unclear what is meant by
this form of security, who defines it and who is being targeted by
security policies as well as how health security is to be generated
\[10\]. [Health security]{.underline} [remains centered on the security
of **nation states**]{.underline} [and defense against **international
threats**]{.underline}, [rather than prioritizing people's health and
its determination]{.underline} \[11\]. [Policymakers in high-income
countries tend to emphasize **protection of their
populations**]{.underline} [particularly against **external
threats**]{.underline}, for example **[bioterrorism]{.underline}**,
**[zoonoses]{.underline}** and **[pandemics]{.underline}**, whereas
many---but not all---global health professionals understand the term in
a broader context of social health protection, population health and its
determination \[12\].

Over the last two decades, [global health security has often become
virtually and almost interchangeably synonymous with global
health]{.underline} \[13\]. **[However]{.underline}**, [this perspective
rather exhibits a **conceptual narrowing** than **epistemic
clarity**.]{.underline} Global health security is actually but one area
of the global health domain, as it primarily addresses cross-border
health threats but not the whole span of global health policy \[14,
15\]. Meanwhile, a universal definition of global health security is
still lacking, despite the abundance of available literature on human
and (global) health security. The recent attempt of the WHO, as the
United Nations (UN) agency specialized on health, to define global
health security falls short as it focuses predominantly on the
international spread of acute infectious threats \[16\]. The fact that
the use of the term "health security" by different actors is as
widespread as it is inconsistent is by no means attributable to the
difficulty of achieving conceptual clarification, but rather to the
widely divergent perceptions, interests, priorities, politics, and power
relations that exist in the broader field of global health \[17\].
Despite its widespread use, the World Health Assembly has not yet agreed
on a resolution on the concept of 'health security', indicating that its
scope is contested among member states \[18\].

### Security\-\--Link\-\--China

#### China threat construction causes violence and serial policy failure.

'China Threat': Stereotypical representations in the US competition with
China.\" International Politics (2024): 1-19. HDCSW-Packet

[With the arrival at the **US presidency**]{.underline} [of Trump and
the turnover of the government staff and foreign policy experts to
shadow him]{.underline} (McCourt 2020),Footnote22 [the]{.underline}
[China Threat became **crucial**]{.underline} in the White House agenda
and narrative, [provoking a **more hostile** US posture towards
Beijing]{.underline}.Footnote23 The [trade]{.underline} war,
[characterised by **contentious negotiations**]{.underline},
[tariff]{.underline} **[increases]{.underline}** and trade disputes
between the US and China, was a significant step in this direction. It
was initiated by Trump's administration in 2018 as a response to China's
long-term unfair trading practices and non-compliance with international
standards, which had contributed to making Chinese products cheaper
while undermining the attractiveness of the US industry, primarily
regarding the high technology sector. Under the leadership of Xi
Jinping, China has begun to highly invest in tech-production (Pei 2020,
85), contending the market with the US -- and other US-friendly leading
countries in the field, like Japan and South Korea (Bell et al. 2023).

Alongside economic barriers and bans, Trump routinised the [use of
**hostile language**]{.underline} against Beijing,
[confirming]{.underline} the **[undiplomatic style]{.underline}**
exhibited during his election campaign. [The scale of the **China
Threat**]{.underline} [grew in the **Trumpian anti-Chinese
rhetoric**]{.underline}. Within a few years, [China went from being
described as a danger to **US security**]{.underline}, [to that of
its]{.underline} **[citizens]{.underline}**, [and ultimately to the
**entire LIO**]{.underline}, fitting rather well Trump's legitimisation
strategy. Similarly, Trump largely built his consensus through a
narrative designed to persuade people to confront what he portrayed as
an imminent threat.Footnote24 Likewise, it neither explores how
[domestic legitimacy was **sought**]{.underline} [through a
**discourse**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
**[delegitimises]{.underline}** ['external' actors]{.underline}, which
is not the goal of this analysis. Instead, it focuses on how Trump, [by
adopting]{.underline} more [anti-Chinese rhetoric]{.underline} than any
previous administration, has [facilitated]{.underline} the **[wider
transmission]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[reinforcement]{.underline}** [of the social representation of China
as a threat to the US public.]{.underline} As George and Campbell write
(1990, 288), '\[...\] The "world" we so often take for granted was not
given by nature, convened by God, or planned by the intentions of
statesmen: It came to be through multiple political practices related as
much to the constitution of various subjectivities as to the
international action of predetermined subjects.'

During the Trump presidency, therefore, [the concept of the **China
Threat**]{.underline} [has largely circulated both at the **academic**
and **governmental levels**]{.underline}, [progressing in parallel with
the]{.underline} **[entrenchment]{.underline}** [of the rivalry between
the US and China, whose relations shifted]{.underline} **[from deep
competition]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[sharp
confrontation]{.underline}**. This US stance, characterised by
confrontation policies and rhetoric, significantly contributed to the
intensification of tension with China, which has responded in assertive
tones to the US attempts to contain its power and damage its reputation.
It was, indeed, when the concept of the China Threat was embedded into
the Trump administration's narrative that US--China relations reached
their lowest point (Nymalm 2020, 188).

In detail, since his run for the White House began, Trump and those in
his administration essentially echoed the realist belief explained by
Thucydides' Trap, which was gaining popularity at the time, that a
rising power may be a threat to the established one (The White House
2017, 23--24; Trump 2020e). [Taking **advantage** of a **domestic
audience** that was more **receptive** to the **idea of China** as a
defying power, Trump pursued]{.underline} a **[nationalist foreign
policy]{.underline}** focused on US interests, which compromised the
dialogue---as a battle of narratives began---and relations with Beijing.
[Most American **IR scholars** and **pundits** read the situation as
evidence of **impending hostility** that realists had long
foreseen]{.underline}. As Allison said in an interview with Bloomberg
Surveillance: 'Donald Trump is in effect an [expression of
what]{.underline} **[Thucydides]{.underline}** would [call the **ruling
power syndrome**]{.underline} that is fearful of a China that has been
growing and is having greater impact on our lives every day' (Allison
2017c). Differently, [few questioned whether the China Threat was
actually acting as a **self-fulfilling prophecy**,]{.underline} inducing
both parts to act consistent with stereotypical expectations attached to
this representation of international politics.

Trump's temperament, and that of prominent members of his cabinet, like
vice-president Mike Pence, the secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the
national security advisor Robert O'Brien, also played a crucial role.
Trump was, quoting Turner and Kaarbo (2021, 462), '\[...\] unusually
emotive for a sitting US president', and surrounded by people who shared
with him the tendency to dichotomize social reality, and which found an
outlet in the growing competition with China.Footnote25 From the trade
war onward, the more interactions with Beijing soured, the more Trump's
administration conveyed the impression that if the US was unable to
preserve its authority over China, this would become hegemonic and
promote an illiberal version of the international order where its
fundamental values would no longer be guaranteed (The White House 2017,
2, 55; 2020, 4--6). Specifically, [they began to accuse China of not
respecting liberal civil and political liberties, showing an
**unexpected interest** in **protecting** these principles,]{.underline}
considering President Trump's intentions to disengage the US from the
role of guarantor of a universal liberal order (Chan 2021; Peterson
2018).Footnote26 For one thing, US citizens were told that China was
interfering with their privacy by spying on American users of TikTok
(Trump 2020a, 2020b). Then, when it came to light in the US public
debate,Footnote27 the smothering of Hong Kong and the systematic
suppression of the Uyghur minority let the Trump administration boost
the propagation of alarming rhetoric towards China's human rights abuses
(O'Brien 2020; Pompeo 2020; Trump 2019a, b, 2020e; b).Footnote28 Making
the picture even worse was the spread of COVID-19 in early 2020, when
Trump blamed Beijing with hiding the contagion, infecting the world and
challenging anyone's health and security, going so far as to repeatedly
term the pandemic 'the Chinese virus' (Trump 2020b; c) ---or using an
overtly racist language, the 'Kung Flu' (Trump 2020c).

Through **[this narrative]{.underline}**, Trump has [influenced the
degree to which]{.underline} **[US society fears China]{.underline}**
(Lerner 2021; Turner 2013), [paving the way for further **association of
China** as 'other' by **emphasising**]{.underline} [its differences to
the US-led West]{.underline} (Pan 2004; Turner 2013; 2014, 21). Such a
renewed concern about the China's rise developed in parallel with
improved attention in academia to the notion of the New Cold War. During
the years of Trump's administration, the confrontation with China took
on a deeper dimension, becoming a matter of identity for the US. This
meant that [every interaction with Beijing was **framed**]{.underline}
[not just as a **political** or **economic struggle**]{.underline}, [but
as a **battle for the soul**]{.underline} [of the world that the US had
to win in order to **protect** and **promote** the values and identity
that the US believed it represented]{.underline}.Footnote29 However,
giving US--China relations the dimension and complexity of an
ideological rivalry radicalised in-depth the hostility between the two
countries, making their diplomatic dialogue more difficult to restore,
even when Trump left the White House.

When elected in late 2020, President Joseph Biden instead rejected the
portrayal of China as an 'enemy' while considering it as the US\'s 'most
serious competitor' (Biden 2021). Nonetheless, the narrative adopted by
the Trump administration has left its mark on the relationship between
the two powers.Footnote30 The US has adopted what seems to be a
long-lasting hostile attitude towards Beijing, leading to the definitive
end of the policy of engagement pursued until then (Campbell and
Sullivan 2019, 96). In turn, China, which has expressed its discontent
with the trade war, sanctions or being described as a threat to the LIO,
is now considerably less sympathetic to the US than in the past (Fang et
al. 2022). To complicate the picture, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022, and Beijing's choice not to take sides against Russia,
are further exacerbating the friction between the US and China, whose
relations have increasingly settled on an identity-value
clash.Footnote31

Conclusion

[The article opens]{.underline} once again the debate on two [relevant
issues]{.underline} for those involved in IR theory: the validity of
assumptions hitherto seen as capable of explaining international
politics, and [the impact of the]{.underline} **[scholarly
agenda]{.underline}** [on foreign policy]{.underline}. In this respect,
the realist version of the China Threat offers an interesting case of
study, as the [mounting competition between the US and China is an event
that]{.underline} **[was first theorised]{.underline}** [and
then]{.underline} **[gradually materialised]{.underline}** [in
practice]{.underline}, being widely discussed in academia and whispered
about in the White House since the early Nineties. This led to the
question of whether [IR theory, and the social representations it
proposes,]{.underline} [can act as a '**self-fulfilling
prophecy'**]{.underline} (Merton 1948; Wendt 1992, 410)---[and whether
realist **beliefs** about]{.underline} [rising powers **set the
stage**]{.underline} [for perceptions of China. Such a
**description**]{.underline} of great power relations [may exhibit
characteristics of **stereotypical thinking**]{.underline} [and have
influenced **US-China interactions**]{.underline} [by inducing both
countries to **behave** according to the prescriptions and conform to
the **expectations**]{.underline} [outlined in the **concept of the
China Threat**]{.underline}. [The creation of a threat is
l]{.underline}ikely to **[require]{.underline}** [a response from
the]{.underline} **[political leaders]{.underline}**, [thus escalating
the risk of becoming trapped in **unnecessary conflicts**]{.underline},
as in the case of China, which has asserted itself more forcefully to
protect its interests and preserve its reputation when faced with an
increasingly confrontational approach from the US. Hence, while this
analysis mainly focuses on the US, the emergence of competition between
the two countries is also attributable to China, which under the
leadership of Xi Jinping has become assertive towards the US-led West.32

[Towards]{.underline} the [end of the Cold War]{.underline}, the
**[necessity of russophobia]{.underline}** became [evident as **reduced
tensions** with the Soviets]{.underline} became [a **threat** to the
West]{.underline}. Some argued that Gorbachev's policies towards the
West were insincere.

Although, irrespective of sincerity, the Soviet peace offensive
[threatened the **entire foundation** of]{.underline} solidarity with
the [West as an **in-group**]{.underline} by altering its [relationship
with the Soviets as the **out-group**]{.underline}. Critics argued that
the principal policy of the Soviets was to reduce the American presence
in Europe and sow divisions to increase Moscow's influence (Gelman,
1987). Gorbachev's "peace offensive" was thus met with profound
scepticism as it reduced European dependence on the US and it undermined
Western solidarity and thus the balancing of the Soviet Union.

The reactions to Gorbachev's peace offensive was similar to that of the
Soviet peace offensive after Stalin's death in 1953 --- when Moscow made
concessions, walked back its rhetoric of world revolution, and called
for peaceful conflict resolution with the West. The efforts were largely
denounced by the US as "peace propaganda" aimed to sow divisions,
prevent rearmament and create the image of the Soviets as a proponent of
peace. US Secretary of State Dean Acheson criticised that "the Russians
have sought to 'monopolize' the dove of peace" (Brooks, 2000: 6). Thus,
the [**mere call for peace** threatened]{.underline} the [**dichotomous
stereotype** of]{.underline} the [**benign** US versus]{.underline} the
[**belligerent** Soviet Union]{.underline}.

When the Cold War finally came to an end, the obvious question for
scholars of propaganda should have been how the fierce propaganda
throughout the Cold War would undermine a post-Cold War settlement.
During the Cold War, Solzhenitsyn had expressed concerns that the
anti-communist propaganda had become interchangeable with antiRussian
propaganda. Solzhenitsyn had advocated that the US should also label
Russia as a "captive nation" and a victim of communism rather than a
benefactor as it would generate sympathy for the Russians, create a
common opposition to communism, and lay the foundation for a harmonious
peace once communism collapsed (Lapidus, 1984). However, the US strategy
for "captive nations" was a Cold War propaganda strategy to use ethnic
nationalism to divide and destabilise the multi-ethnic Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia (Lapidus, 1984). Thus, the preference for portraying the
Soviet Union as a manifestation of Russian imperialism would result in
the continuation of containment after the Cold War by fuelling ethnic
nationalism and mobilise US sentiment against post-communist Russia.

A [**workable peace** after the Cold War]{.underline} was [obstructed by
making NATO]{.underline} an [**insurance policy** against **future
conflicts with Russia**]{.underline}. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright confirmed the insurance policy logic in a testimony to the
Senate Armed Services Committee in April 1997: "On the offchance that in
fact Russia doesn't work out the way that we are hoping it will... NATO
is there" (Carpenter & Conly, 1998). Former US Secretary of State James
Baker (2002) acknowledged that NATO had become "an insurance policy
against resurgent and possibly virulent Russian nationalism". Baker
warned against the approach of [**preparing NATO** for a **future
conflict with Russia**]{.underline} as it would [become a
**self-fulfilling prophecy**]{.underline}. [When Russia **eventually
responded** to]{.underline} these [security challenges]{.underline},
[NATO could **denounce** Russia as **aggressive** and
**threatening**]{.underline}, thus gradually returning to its official
mission of containing Russia.

There was initially an overwhelming consensus among US policymakers
after the Cold War that NATO expansion would poison the relationship
with Russia and reignite a conflict (Grayson, 1999). After significant
lobbying, the consensus shifted under the **[ideological
argument]{.underline}** that [NATO]{.underline} had converted itself
into [a **peaceful community of democracies**]{.underline}.
[Beneath]{.underline} the **[new branding of NATO]{.underline}**, there
was nonetheless recognition for the [**implied continued mission** of
containing Russia]{.underline} (Grayson, 1999; Mandelbaum, 1995). Even
hawks, such as Richard Pipes signed a statement by the Coalition Against
NATO Expansion (CANE), which recognised that: [By its
nature]{.underline}, a **[military alliance]{.underline}** is [directed
**against** someone]{.underline}. The [**geography of NATO expansion**
makes its target clear]{.underline}: [Russia]{.underline}\... The
[proposal to expand NATO]{.underline} tosses it away by [telling Russia
in **unmistakable terms**]{.underline} that [it **remains excluded**
from]{.underline} the [community of Western nations]{.underline}\...
\[Russia\] will remember, and ultimately, she will react, either from a
position of renewed strength or out of desperation. The last great
unfinished business of the 20th century is the reintegration of Russia
with the West. With the proposal to expand NATO, we have turned our back
on it. (CENA, 1998)

[NATO's messaging to Russia]{.underline} was [characterised
by]{.underline} a [**contradictory approach** of **reassurance** and
**deterrence**]{.underline}. [NATO reassured Russia it was
not]{.underline} considered [a threat and]{.underline} was
[not]{.underline} the [target of NATO]{.underline}, although
[**simultaneously deterring** Russia by cautioning]{.underline} that
[NATO]{.underline} would be [turned against Russia]{.underline} if it
chose the wrong path. NATO (2010) defined this insurance policy:
"because Russia's future policies toward NATO remain difficult to
predict, the Allies must pursue the goal of cooperation while also
guarding against the possibility that Russia could decide to move in a
more adversarial direction".

As [Russia]{.underline} is [**presented with the dilemma** of
being]{.underline} an [**apprentice** or **threat** to Western
civilisation]{.underline}, the [West]{.underline} had to [respond
with]{.underline} strategic ambiguity. [Attempting to **simultaneously
civilise and contain** Russia]{.underline} demanded strategic ambiguity
in the 1990s as Russia had to internalise the notion of the West as a
benign hegemon in order for Russia to accept its role as a political
object. Russia could not be defined as a threat and openly contained,
yet Russia could not be disconfirmed as a threat as it would undermine
the security guarantees to the Central and Eastern European allies.

[Russia raising]{.underline} the [security concerns of an **expanding
military alliance** and being excluded]{.underline} from Europe
[reaffirms **Russia's backwardness**]{.underline} and made NATO
expansion even more necessary. NATO had transformed itself into a
community of liberal democratic values and NATO's failure to expand was
a great danger as it would reaffirm the Soviet propaganda that NATO is
an offensive military alliance rather than a defensive alliance: "If
Russia's rulers have no revanchist aspirations, they have no reason to
resent NATO's inclusion of the new democracies" (Will, 1996). Kennan,
the author of the Long Telegram of 1946 and architect of the containment
policy against the Soviet Union, lived well after the collapse of the
Soviet Union and was exasperated that the containment policy would
continue against post-Soviet Russia. In an interview with Friedman
(1998), Kennan lambasted the "ill-informed" Senate debates that
demonstrated "so little understanding of Russian history and Soviet
history", which subsequently resulted in the decision to expand NATO: I
was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying
to attack Western Europe. Don't people understand? Our differences in
the cold war were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are
turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless
revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime. Of course there is
going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then \[the NATO expanders\]
will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are --- but
this is just wrong.

Bloc discipline within an [alliance requires]{.underline} the
[**continuous elevation** of an external threat to
perpetuate]{.underline} the [**dividing lines** between the in-group and
the out-group]{.underline}. The **[endurance of anti-Russian
propaganda]{.underline}** therefore [requires]{.underline} the
[**creation** of a **Russian threat** when it is]{.underline}
insufficient or [absent]{.underline}. In Italy, the [US]{.underline}
pursued [clandestine stay-behind operations]{.underline} after the
Second World War [under]{.underline} the [codename Operation
Gladio]{.underline} lasting until 1990, in which the [CIA and NATO
conducted **false-flag terrorist attacks**]{.underline} that could be
[blamed on **red brigades**]{.underline} (Ganser, 2005). Such staybehind
operations [also existed in]{.underline} other [Western
European]{.underline} states, and the European Community (1990)
acknowledged that [**Western intelligence agencies** in collaboration
with NATO]{.underline} "were [involved in **serious cases** of terrorism
and crime]{.underline}" against the populations of Western Europe. The
US planned similar false-flag operations within its own territory. Case
in point, the [US **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense]{.underline} and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed **[Operation Northwoods]{.underline}** in
1962, in which the [US government]{.underline} would [commit acts of
terrorism]{.underline} against American civilian and military targets
[to blame them on]{.underline} the [Cuban]{.underline} government
(Nelson, 2001). Declassified documents also reveal that the [US sought
to acquire]{.underline} an [**authentic Soviet aircraft** or
**manufacture a replica** to stage]{.underline} "a [**provocation
operation** in which Soviet aircraft]{.underline} would **[appear to
attack]{.underline}** US or friendly installations [to
provide]{.underline} an [excuse for US intervention]{.underline}" (**[US
National Archives]{.underline}**, 1962: 2).

There are at least three different approaches [to interpret
the]{.underline} question of the [wrong(ness) of
colonialism]{.underline}, rooted in [utilitarian]{.underline},
anti/post-colonial and analytic [traditions]{.underline}. The first
interpretation, echoing a utilitarian approach, [uses this question as a
cue to offer a **cost-benefit analysis**]{.underline}. There are several
legal-political accounts that list, quantify or measure the supposed
advantages of colonialism (to the colonial metropoles and even
purportedly to the colonies) against its injustices and perpetrated
wrongs (See De Juan and Pierskalla, 2017; Manning, 1974). [From this
lens]{.underline}, [colonialism's injustices and violence are generally
read as **externalities**]{.underline} of colonial experiments, that are
either [regarded as **unintended** or **justified** as
necessary.]{.underline} This is where [calls for '**balancing the
discourse** on colonialism' come from,]{.underline} mostly from the
former metropoles or the local elite in postcolonial societies that were
the [beneficiaries of the colonial enterprise]{.underline}. But
[regardless of where the balance of calculation tips in the end, this
very exercise is based on **unjustified** **comparators and a troubling
ethic**]{.underline}. [It should not be difficult to acknowledge that no
mileage of train tracks laid, tons of tea sold, or acres of land
cultivated could justify the **servitude** and **enslavement** of
populations, **murder of millions**, **destruction of cultures** and
**impoverishment of generations**]{.underline}.

The anti/de-colonial interpretation, prominent within the study of law
and (post)colonialism, differs from the above and takes this at best as
a rhetorical question and at worst as an insidious one. For those of us
working in these areas, discussing whether colonialism was wrong has
increasingly become a moot point as details of colonialism's horrors
surface through detailed historical and archival studies (see, for
instance, Hochschild, 2012; Marchal, 2017). But the why and how of
colonial wrongs still invite analyses from a diverse array of
perspectives. This view informs a multitude of calls for decolonisation
by scholars and by activists, ranging from demands to interrogate
institutional setups to revisions of curricula (Bhambra et al., 2018),
tearing down of colonial symbols and statues (Chantiluke et al., 2018),
and examinations of colonial assumptions with disciplines including
governance (Carter, 2019), history (Alvares, 1991), gender (Lugones,
2008), finance and economics (Alami, 2019), natural sciences
(Chakrabarti, 2010) and law (Dhanda and Parashar, 2009; Pahuja, 2011;
Adébísí, 2023;). One corollary of this, however, is that as calls for
decolonisation become more visible within wider public discourses, the
calls for conceptual clarity of our categories grows as well, which
leads us to the third interpretation of the wrong of colonialism.

The more recent perspective comes from analytic philosophy which, in the
spirit of calling for clarity of concepts, has presented a crucial
challenge to identify the specific and distinct wrong of colonialism.
This is premised on the notion that if we deem it sufficient to critique
colonialism solely as an example of a rapacious, violent and unjust
political system, that does not necessarily render colonialism a
distinct historical and political phenomenon. [Colonial regimes across
various continents were admittedly associated with slavery, economic
exploitation, genocide and extermination of native
populations]{.underline} (Casas, 2019), [capture of land and
livelihoods, mass relocation of populations]{.underline} (Ali, 1988;
Talbot, 2007), [murder, rape and torture of dissidents]{.underline}
(Hochschild, 2012), [as well as denigration and destruction of various
cultures and knowledges]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2009). [Within the
traditional approach in the broad field of law and colonialism, the sum
of these wrongs or **even the presence** of some of these wrongs is
taken as **reason enough** to indict the colonial enterprise, and
rightly so.]{.underline} But the question of a distinct wrong as raised
by analytic moral and political philosophy suggests that, as the harms
listed above are wrong in themselves regardless of the political system
that perpetrates them, [the distinctive wrong of colonialism -- one that
is wrong in and of itself and which would make colonialism a distinct
social-political-legal system -- is to be found beyond the '**systematic
perpetration**' of these other harms and injustices]{.underline} (Renzo,
2019: 348).

An (ongoing) interrogation of the wrongness and injustices of
colonialism, therefore, is important for debates on decolonisation,
historical injustice and restorative justice, racial and gender
equality, and global political and socio-economic justice. This article
presents a theoretical study of colonialism's legal-political injustices
and aims to (re)turn the discussion on colonialism and decolonisation to
the field's most powerful insight, i.e., of epistemic violence and
injustice. To address analytic philosophy's question, it argues that
[colonialism's **epistemic injustice**]{.underline}, [which denied the
**very being** and ways of being of the colonised, is the
**foundational** and **distinctive feature** of colonialism as a
political system and which **drives its continued impact**]{.underline}
to this day. This article suggests that the reach of this historical
injustice went much further than the politics of autonomy, usurpation of
territorial rights, political disenfranchisement and resource
appropriation, even though these facets certainly remain important to
understand colonial violations and cannot be separated from its
epistemic wrong. [The link between epistemic violence and colonialism is
not new, but this paper outlines the contours of what epistemic
injustice would refer to in the context of colonialism and deepens it
within the wider scheme of political and territorial
injustices.]{.underline}

This paper will proceed in three stages. The first section will develop
the question further and discuss the importance and parameters of this
inquiry. The subsequent sections will then look at the accounts that
identify colonialism mainly as territorial usurpation and those that
condemn colonialism's political wrong, associated with the creation of
non-reciprocal institutions. The paper will engage with these
perspectives in detail and will discuss how these accounts end up taking
a political view on colonialism and, because of this, completely
disassociate its 'distinct wrong' from its other injustices. In the
final step, the paper will present its perspective on the notion of the
epistemic wrong and discuss how the assumed inequality of human beings
was at the foundation of the colonial enterprise. It will be argued that
this distinct wrong was also foundational in nature, as it contributed
to the political and territorial harms perpetrated through colonialism

Searching for Colonialism's Distinct Wrong

[Scrutinising the 'wrong of colonialism' is not a completely novel
enquiry, even if the recent phrasing of this problem reflects a specific
disciplinary lineage. While discussions on colonialism have progressed
within the scholarship on international law]{.underline} (Anghie, 2005;
Craven, 2007; Pahuja, 2011), [human rights]{.underline} (Douzinas, 2000;
Baxi, 2002), [legal theory]{.underline} (Santos, 2002; Dhanda and
Parashar, 2009) a[nd especially global south-oriented political
theory]{.underline} (Quijano, 2007; Escobar, 2004; Mignolo, 2009),
[analytic legal and political philosophy has not engaged with this
question in a sustained manner]{.underline} (Renzo, 2019: 347). The
[societal impact of colonialism, how it structured the colonies and the
metropoles in a socio-economic system, colonialism's formulation of
political institutions through its particular logic, the (in)efficacy of
political decolonisation]{.underline}, and [postcolonial
continuities]{.underline} -- all these questions have been widely
discussed by decolonial thinkers and scholars from the global south.
[Many of these accounts point towards, even if implicitly, central
injustices of colonialism from different vantage points]{.underline}.
The question of identification of colonial wrongs is also never distant
from discussions on anti-racism, civil and political rights, redress,
and reparations for the descendants of colonised and enslaved people.
Even the connection between epistemically violent nature of colonialism
is increasingly well-acknowledged (Fitzpatrick, 1992; Mignolo, 2009;
Quijano, 2007; Boaventura de Sousa, 2018). But the recent framing of the
question in philosophy requires identification of that which makes
colonialism 'wrong as such', that is 'over and above \[the\] familiar
outrages' (Ypi, 2013: 161-162) building on the intuitive understanding
that colonialism is not only distinct as a socio-political, legal and
historical occurrence, but that there is something distinctly wrong at
its core that makes it so. A key aim of the paper, therefore, is to draw
a link between this question and insights from the field of law and
colonialism.

This challenge does not automatically validate the claims and
assumptions within the analytic philosophy's debate on colonialism. The
suggestion that colonialism, as any other historical or conceptual
entity, can be continuously stripped of its non-essential properties to
the point where we are able to reach its central and singular essence,
is a problematic one. This attempt at understanding or deconstructing
the link between a particular entity and its attributes, rooted in the
philosophical discourse on individuation (see Swinburne, 1995; Bailey,
2012), is not an issue in its own right. The difficulty arises when this
essence -- the core attribute, or the injustice of colonialism in this
case -- is considered not only distinct, but also disconnected from all
other properties of the particular instance. The claim then seems to
suggest that there is ultimately one central wrong that makes
colonialism a distinct sociolegal and political phenomenon, and that
this wrong can not only be divested from all other colonial injustices,
but is in itself also sufficient to indict colonialism's injustice. This
could possibly downplay wider colonial injustices -- its violence,
dispossession and dislocation -- which is why this study interprets the
question differently. It holds that the distinct injustice at the heart
of colonialism can never be completely disconnected from all the other
harms perpetrated by colonial regimes. The distinct wrong, therefore, is
not a sufficient condition of colonialism but it is its foundational
condition that enabled, actualised and aggravated colonialism's
genocidal and rapacious tendencies.

In this regard, the idea of a distinct injustice of colonialism should
be able to address three concerns: one, it would distinguish colonialism
as a socio-political phenomenon; second, it would potentially explain
the interplay between the foundational wrong and other colonial
injustices if the latter are not to be taken as merely incidental; and
third, it would allow us to understand its place within the
heterogeneity of colonialism(s). This distinct wrong of colonialism
should not be confused with its cause. Mercantilist expansion, desire
for wealth, the growing need for markets and resources, capitalist
extraction, the greed for slave labour and the desire for political
domination -- any and all of these could reasonably be considered
important factors behind colonialism. All of these tendencies were
integral to the colonial project and they remain present in varying
degrees in postcolonial societies today, although none of these reasons
were colonialism's necessary or sufficient cause, especially given
colonialism's genocidal and rapacious turn. It was their curious
interplay with epistemic injustice that ultimately resulted in the
colonialism that is recognisable and indicted today in the former
colonies.

This distinct and foundational wrong, the study argues, is colonialism's
epistemic injustice. It not only instantiated the worst of the colonial
tendencies but is also the reason why any of its supposed advances for
the colonies pale in comparison to the inhumanity that it created and
sustained. Colonialism, and particularly European colonialism, was an
epistemically unjust project which was premised on and perpetuated the
assumed inequality of human beings, and which had a legal, political,
territorial, socio-economic and cultural manifestation. This (in)human
inequality fed other wrongs of colonialism -- without this foundational
injustice, territorial usurpation, forced relocation, massacres of
groups, mutilation of bodies, kidnapping of children and destruction of
communities would not have taken place, at least so readily. It is this
**[framework of systemic exploitation]{.underline}** and often
[**legalised violence** animated by an **epistemic wrong**]{.underline}
which [makes colonialism distinct from other unjust political setups and
from other exercises of territorial usurpation and resource
appropriation]{.underline}. This does not mean that epistemic injustice
is not found in other guises within other socio-political systems, but
that without this colonialism would not have been what we recognise it
as today.

Finally, [there is nothing homogenous about colonialism as a historical
and political phenomenon, even if we are examining European colonial
regimes that are widely grouped under this category]{.underline}. There
certainly were other hegemonic, conquering and, arguably, colonial
regimes in different parts of the world at different times. Even within
European colonialism there was a diverse array of approaches and even
the capture of many colonies differed from one another (Bhambra, 2022).
More generally, commentators differentiate between settler colonies and
political colonialism, between direct and indirect rule, between
colonialism for commercial exploitation and the one rooted in the
civilising mission, between extractive colonialism and the one that
employed slavery and genocide, and so on. The spectrum of colonialism(s)
ranges from the colonisation of the uninhabited Bermuda through to
capture of African and American continents and the horrors of the
Transatlantic Slave Trade. Colonialism, therefore, should be taken as a
plural category within itself. But although it may not be useful to
essentialise all that is colonial into one neat classification, it is
important to recognise that there are nonetheless some underlying trends
present in the European colonial enterprise, one of which is being
identified and problematised here. The notion of a distinctive wrong
should be able to account, at least partially, for a thread that runs
across wider colonial practices.

\[SHRUNK TEXT\-\--NONE REMOVED\]

There are two main groups in which the dominant accounts of the
identification of colonial wrong can be categorised: first, the
perspectives focussing on territorial rights and resource appropriation
and, second, arguments that categorise colonialism purely as a
politically unjust system, the latter of which is also linked to the
idea of self-determination. These accounts are not standalone
propositions but are rather umbrella terms encompassing a range of
different positions within them. The following sections will examine
these two concepts of territorial and political wrongs of colonialism in
turn and then highlight how their view of colonialism's historical
injustice leaves out a key dimension that serves as a key focus for
decolonial thinking.

Understanding Colonialism as a Distinct Territorial Injustice

Territorial usurpation has generally been a prominent lens through which
colonialism is critiqued, decolonisation struggles are interpreted, and
reparative justice measures are conceptualised. This is premised on the
understanding that the influx of colonisers -- whether as settlers or as
conquerors, as merchants or priests, as slave-drivers or so-called
civilisers -- primarily violated the indigenous or native people's claim
to land. 'The actual geographical possession of land is what empire in
the final analysis is all about,' Edward Said noted (Said, 1993: 78).
This is undoubtedly rooted in how colonialism was largely manifested.
Land was the site for the colonial project; it provided the theatre in
which the colonial encounter played out and where its materiality was
created and experienced. At the height of its power in the early 20th
century, the British Empire is said to have controlled almost a quarter
of the world's territory, most of it taken away from native and
indigenous populations. Colonisation, settlement, depopulation and the
cultural contest, 'all of this occurs on, about, or because of land'
(Said, 1993: 78). Even the critique of colonialism as a system aimed at
appropriation of natural resources directly flows from this approach.
The Preamble of the 1960 UN Declaration on Decolonisation, for instance,
held that 'all peoples have an inalienable right to complete freedom,
the exercise of their sovereignty and the integrity of their national
territory' and that 'peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of
their natural wealth and resources...' (UNGA, 1960). This idea is then
repeated in clause 2 of the Common Article 1 of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1976) and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR,
1976), with the further addition of the prohibition of depriving people
from their 'own means of subsistence.' The varied calls for reparations
and restorative justice for colonial wrongdoing also reflect this notion
in many cases (Klein and Fouksman, 2022). 'For a colonised people the
most essential value, because the most concrete' Fanon wrote, 'is first
and foremost the land: the land which will bring them bread and, above
all, dignity' (Fanon, 2001: 34). Clearly, usurpation of indigenous and
colonised people's land was and remains a grave injustice. We may go
even further to assert that colonialism as we know it may not be
recognised as such without an extra-territorial application of epistemic
and political injustices. This is why some scholars claim that it is
impossible to understand the injustice of colonialism without first
understanding the wrong of settler colonialism (Moore, 2016). But, if
the distinct wrong of colonialism was to lie solely in the taking of
territory from indigenous people, this would require us to pay attention
to two aspects as discussed previously: its interplay with the other
colonial wrongs, and its ability to render colonialism a distinct
socio-political system. This is why, despite the injustice of
dispossession and dislocation, and its continued impact on the lives of
the dispossessed, the distinctiveness of the colonial-territorial wrong
is not easily established. Colonialism involved territorial usurpation,
but not all territorial conquest that occurred in the last 6 few hundred
years would be labelled as colonialism. However, this is perhaps not a
very sophisticated challenge -- as discussed previously, it is not
disputed that the distinct (territorial) wrong as an attribute is not
present in any other socio-political phenomenon. Instead, the task is to
recognise it as a foundational injustice, so that even in the absence of
violence or other injustices the distinct wrong would make the colonial
enterprise wrong-as-such and distinct from other socio-political
systems. Historically, territorial rights have proven difficult to
conceptualise, which is one of the reasons why the discussion on this
topic oscillates between rights to property -- premised on ownership
and/or possession of land -- and rights to or from territory (Moore,
2015: 16). The right to territory, generally associated with modern
State sovereignty and claims of other collective political agents, is a
group of different rights clustered together. These include: (i) The
right to jurisdiction (the legitimate authority to formulate and enforce
laws in the territory; authority to implement normative and behavioural
codes); (ii) the right to resources (which would include control,
extraction, use or sale of any resources present on the territory; right
to resources produced on or within the territory, as well as to
resources produced by those who live on the land, such as income tax);
and (iii) the right to manage borders (which would include right to
erect and control borders, allow or disallow easements, permit movement
of goods and people in and out of the territory, and also, importantly,
the right to exclude others from entering, occupying of making use of
the territory in question) (Miller, 2012: 253; Simmons, 2001: 306).
Property rights, in turn, are rights associated with the use, possession
and/or (legal) ownership over a piece of land that allow the individual
or collective rights-holders to make use of, possess or exclude others
from the property. In terms of ownership, the normative underpinnings
for land as property are based on the right to territory which is
conceptually prior to the right to property (Moore, 2015: 16). A
detailed evaluation of the conceptions of territorial and property
rights is not our central aim here, but there are some important
questions that must be considered for territorial usurpation to be
considered colonialism's distinct and foundational injustice. The wrong
of colonialism could either lie in violation of the native people's
right to territory, the manner in which land was usurped, or the
exclusion of indigenous and native people from the territory once it was
taken over. The distinct territorial injustice of colonialism could
relate to any or all of these wrongs. If this distinct wrong was to be
solely in the usurpation of territory, it would assume the pre-existing
right to permanently and absolutely exclude all newcomers to a
territory. An absolutist normative position that territorial rights of
inhabitants -- whether indigenous people of colonised lands or natives
of any territory in present day -- could permanently exclude the claims
of outsiders is a difficult one to argue for, especially in the light of
its implications as a moral-universal principle applicable to our
current challenges. In fact, anti-immigration political parties and
far-right groups across Europe, Australia and the US employ similar
arguments to justify their positions against migration, for instance the
closed-borders narrative emerging in response to the perceived 'refugee
crisis' in Europe (Davitti, 2019). Regardless of the contradictions
posed by the histories of US and Europe themselves, this argument should
be evaluated carefully by those concerned with equitable rights for
people seeking refuge due to climate change, calamities and conflicts.
However, if we take the right to exclude as a limited rather than an
absolute one, this requires a critique of the manner in which land was
usurped (through violence) or the exclusion of native population from
their inhabited land (conflict of normative orders). 7 With regard to
the exclusion of the native population, Moore indicates that the concept
of 'fairness' could be considered as justification for 'land
egalitarianism' or distribution of resources to all, including newcomers
(even colonial settlers) beyond the 'sufficiency constraint', i.e., what
is not needed to live beyond 'minimally decent lives' can be shared
(Moore, 2019: 100-102). Paradoxically, this logic was used by many
theorists to justify colonialism and conquest. John Locke's argument
about the labour theory of land value, for instance, justified the
taking over of 'waste land' from the natives to make it productive
(Arneil, 1996: 138-144). Notwithstanding the problems of treating
indigenous territories as so-called waste land, this idea treats land as
property and purely an economic resource. But people's connection to
land is not just as means to food or resources; they also have history,
traditions, memories and ways of living attached to land. People, place
and land exist in a symbiotic relationship (Black, 2016: 165), and land
was the 'cosmic' setting for the bond between the living, the dead and
the unborn, disrupted by colonialism (Black, 2011: 15-16). Land has a
normative importance for people, which makes it an essential background
condition for our lives. Through this perspective, land usurpation is a
violation of 'legitimate expectations' of natives or indigenous people's
claim to territory -- it curtails not only their use of land and its
resources, but also limits what they can 'legitimately expect' as users,
occupiers and possessors of the land (Moore, 2019: 92). The
appropriation of land by colonial regimes and colonial settlers was
problematic, both for denying the natives access to land as a morally
significant category, as well as because of appropriation of what went
beyond their needs. But that said, the heterogeneity of colonial
practices poses a key challenge here. While colonialism's territorial
wrong is able to explain the core injustice of settler colonialism, it
is unable to critique other forms and wrongs of colonialism. There is,
for example, the case of colonisation of Bermuda by the English, which
allegedly had no native inhabitants at the time (Moore, 2015: 1).
Mauritius, a colony established by the French primarily as a sugar
plantation and populated by convicts and enslaved people from other
territories, presents a similar difficulty (Anderson, 2000: 1-10).
Equally problematic is the challenge presented by slavery, or of trade
by colonial merchant corporations, which presented diverse forms of
colonialism(s) before the mass-scale capture of land in India from
mid-18th century onwards or the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th
century. The English East India Company traded between Britain and Asia
for almost 150 years before becoming a colonial administration after the
Battle of Plassey, which granted it immense landholdings in India and
rights associated with sovereignty (Robins, 2006: 75). Mass-scale
territorial usurpation in Africa came largely in the 19th century,
almost four centuries after the horrific enslavement and commodification
of African people had begun. Then there is the case of establishment of
colonies such as New England, by people some of whom were fleeing
religious and sectarian persecution in England and Europe. Although
there is now increasing evidence that these early colonists' religious
reasons were never distant from economic considerations (Arneil, 1996:
111; also, Warren, 2016), this does not fit neatly into the discourse on
land conquest as the harm that defines colonialism. This therefore
becomes a key issue: If some early colonial settlers were merchantmen or
even migrants out to gain commercial advantage or looking to plunder
wealth in the earlier decades of the colonial project, how do we
reconcile this category of colonialism with the wider paradigm? It would
be simplistic to assert that colonialism only began and was only wrong
once the capture of land began, as it would exclude many other
injustices of colonialism. Violence, both direct and structural,
exhibited by the colonisers as part of the colonial project, poses
another difficulty and remains its most horrific legacy. The usurpation
of land was itself an 8 act of violence, but the gratuitous violence
that marked the colonial project throughout its history went beyond it.
Adam Hochschild's masterful study of Leopold II's reign of Congo Free
State shows how the population of the region is likely to have decreased
by half (approximately ten million people) due to starvation,
exhaustion, declining birth rates and state-sanctioned murders and
punishments during Belgian colonial rein (Hochschild, 2012: 223). More
than 7,500 Congolese natives lost their lives just in the widening of
railways in Belgian Congo in the 1920s (Marchal, 2017: xix). It was not
only the taking of land from these groups that was the problem, but the
brutality which generally accompanied the 'discovery' and capture of
land and its people. Bartolomé de Las Casas's account of 1542 on the
colonisation of the Indies by Spanish colonialists noted that 'they have
the healthiest lands in the world, where lived more than five hundred
thousand souls; they are now deserted, inhabited not by a single living
creature \[as all\] the people were slain or died after being taken into
captivity \[as slaves\]' (Zinn and Arnove, 2004: 37). He also observed
how the conquistadors took 'infants from their mothers' breasts,
snatching them by the arms and threw them into the rivers, roaring with
laughter and saying as the babies fell into the water, "Boil there, you
offspring of the devil!"' (Zinn and Arnove, 2004: 39). The chain of
violence set in motion by the colonial empire(s) continued long after
the political reins were taken over by other actors. In 1838, thousands
of Cherokee people died when they were forcibly removed from their lands
and made to 'march one thousand miles westward' at the height of the
so-called Jacksonian Democracy in the United States. For the cruelty
that marked this journey and the lives of indigenous people lost in this
passage, it came to be known as 'The Trail of Tears' or 'The Trail Where
They Cried' (Zinn and Arnove, 2004: 142). This wanton violence, that
accompanied land usurpation but also went beyond it, indicts colonialism
as an epistemic injustice. Settler colonialism was only possible because
the native community's humanity was not acknowledged and consequently
destroyed, when territory was taken over from natives under legal claims
such as terra nullius -- 'a territory belonging to no one' (Mabo, 1992).
Terra nullius had been a key conceptual and legal instrument in the
justification of colonialism: if international law permitted the legal
occupation of empty land, and if it could be said that the colonised
land was 'empty', then occupations stood validated. It was only in 1992
through the landmark Mabo case that Australian courts recognised the
native title to land and for the first time dismissed the idea that
Australian territory was terra nullius before colonisation. What
deserves more attention here is that declaring an occupied land as empty
required a prior act of negation of the very existence of the colonised
and the enslaved. The 'discovery' itself was an act of giving a 'name
and meaning upon a place encapsulated'; its underlying premise was to
inscribe 'nothingness upon the being of the discovered' (Nayar, 2022).
The land was not empty but rendered as such, either through executions,
enslavements and forced relocations, or by denials of the humanity of
the indigenous people, and the cultural-normative frameworks through
which first nations inhabited that land. Land was the site on which
racial differentiation, property rights and (bio-political) power met
and acted upon the bodies of the colonised and the enslaved. Bhandar
aptly notes that private property and racial subjectivity are
'articulated conjointly' within settler colonialism (Bhandar, 2018: 9).
All this was premised on the denial of the equal humanity of the
colonised with their norms too unlawful to be considered laws and their
lives too subhuman to be considered of consequence. It is this
acknowledgement that moves us towards epistemic injustice as the
foundational wrong behind land usurpation, as will be discussed further
on in the article. 9 Some accounts and even apologies of colonial land
usurpation acknowledge the cultural divergence and differences in how
indigenous groups and the colonial settlers viewed their engagement with
land. The clash between these ways of living, for instance between
pastoralism and intensive agriculture, between sustainable living and
resource extraction -- between land as property and land as cosmos
(Black, 2011) -- meant that natives were not able to 'exercise
collective agency over their lives', which made colonialism more
problematic (Moore, 2019: 97). But regarding the difference in cultural
norms and differences in engaging with land, there are two ways to
approach this issue: either, a suggestion that these differences meant
that colonialism curtailed the natives' exercise of collective agency
and autonomy; or by claiming that there were irreconcilable epistemic
differences and diversity between native inhabitants which colonialism
at best ignored and at worst used as an instrument of colonial
appropriation. While the latter category takes the discussion towards
epistemic injustice of colonialism, the former brings into play the
importance of political institutions regarding collective agency and
enfranchisement, to which the paper now turns to. Colonialism as a
Distinct Political Wrong Political domination, disenfranchisement of the
native population and authoritarian modes of control have become
synonymous with colonial wrongdoing. Self-determination as political
decolonisation remains inherently tied up with this understanding and
was the main call for many national liberation struggles. Colonialism
was perpetrated through a host of legal, political, economic and social
institutions -- corporations, colonialists and states alike. At the
heart of the political critique of colonialism is the emphasis on unjust
political structures and institutions -- be it coercion associated with
the creation of these structures, the lack of accountability and
responsiveness towards the people they governed, or the people's
disenfranchisement in shaping, maintaining and legitimising the
political institutions. This is the line of reasoning which eventually
leads us towards more recognisable ideas of decolonisation based
democratisation, home-rule and swaraj (Gandhi, 2009: 25-28), and the
right to self-determination (Stilz, 2015), sometimes in the guise of
nationalism. Political independence featured prominently in statements
on decolonisation struggles, which is why mentions of 'decolonisation'
are generally taken to mean political decolonisation (see, for instance,
Bernstorff and Dann, 2019). In a statement carrying the same tones as
the 1779 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the Indian
National Congress's 1930 Independence Day Resolution demanded 'Purna
swaraj or complete independence' on the basis that the 'British
Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their
freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has
ruined India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually'
(Indian National Congress, 1930). This understanding is also reflected
in the way colonialism is conventionally understood in international
law. The common article 1 of ICCPR and ICESCR states that 'all peoples
have a right to self-determination' and that they can 'freely determine
their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and
cultural development' by virtue of this right (ICCPR, 1976; ICESCR,
1976). The UN Declaration on Decolonisation mentions people's right to
self-determination and notes that 'alien subjugation, domination and
exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights' (UNGA,
1960). Moreover, Article 22 of The Covenant of the League of Nations
1919 which established the system of Mandate Lands and as a trust to be
managed by 'advanced nations', stated that 'to those colonies and 10
territories... inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves
under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be
applied the principle that the well-being and development of such
peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation' (League of Nations, 1919;
emphasis added). This 'responsibility' of governance was passed on to
the United Nations Trusteeship Council when the UN replaced the League
of Nations, and the Council continued its operations until the 1994
Independence of Palau. The significant injustice of political
disenfranchisement granted, its distinctiveness remains to be
established. There are two ways in which a political system can be
considered unequal or nonreciprocal. One is that the political structure
does not give due regard to the voices and concerns of the members (or
subjects). This does not refer to the minority that loses out in a
public vote but to the complete disregard for the choices and welfare of
(some) members or groups within the society. The other way that the
system can be non-reciprocal is if the foundational rules that underpin
the society's political structures are themselves unrepresentative and
exclusionary. Based on this and taking lead from Kantian
cosmopolitanism, Ypi suggests that an 'ideal political system' depicts
or exhibits equality and reciprocity through two separate but related
conditions. The first category deals with the 'creation of associative
norms' -- mainly the process of forming an association between
individuals, or between the collectives that these individuals are
members of (Ypi, 2013: 178). It is self-evident that an association
formed through coercion or compulsion would lack legitimacy and deny
participants their political agency and autonomy. But equality and
reciprocity flow directly from the process of association, which
requires that the substantive principles around which the association is
structured are also equal and reciprocal, which then becomes the second
important requirement. A political system established through consent,
but which implements discriminatory or substantively unjust policies
against one or a few specific members would still fall short of this
equality condition. The denial of reciprocity and equality in the
colonial political system is not limited to individuals but holds true
for collective agents, and includes the negation of both expressed will
and implied consent. There is hardly a political realm in the world
which could realistically claim to have the consent to govern from the
entirety of its population. The far from universal participation in
elections around the world, or even general lack of involvement of
people in the workings of governance institutions, even in a
long-running democracies, suggest the same. But the denial of consent in
a colonial regime takes the situation to an extreme, where is ceases to
be about absence of consent but more about 'forced association' (Renzo,
2019: 349). This would suggest that colonialism's distinct injustice is
that it is a system established through coercion ('forced association')
or whose rules are based on unequal representation. Valentini takes this
further and argues that the wrong of colonialism lies either in 'the
subjection of individual members of colonised collectives to alien
powers or the subjection of the collective itself' (Valentini, 2015:
316). Insightful as they may be, these accounts of colonialism's
distinct political injustice raise two difficulties. First, like the
perspectives on territorial injustice, these too are unable to explain
the heterogeneity of colonialism(s) and the interplay with other
colonial injustices. Political disenfranchisement remains a grave wrong
of colonialism, but does not necessarily explain colonialism's other
injustices, particularly its gratuitous violence, which they treat as
incidental. It would be a stretch to include colonialism's more violent
forms such as slavery, forced relocation, murders, mass punishments and
even territorial conquest, within this category as birth pangs of an
unequal society. As previously discussed, a system based on
commodification of people or 11 complete negation of their existence is
more horrific than any society based on unequal associative norms.
Second, these propositions are unable to distinguish between colonialism
and forced annexation and could therefore be considered 'overinclusive'
(Renzo, 2019: 350). Annexation pertains to conquest and subsumption of
foreign territories, whether independent or part of (or seceding from)
other countries, based on either a historical claim to land or an
affiliation with the population inhabiting that territory. It is an act
of force, and thus certainly violates the condition of forced
association and perhaps even of equal representation. But while
annexation has been a question for international law in relation to
political decolonisation and self-determination, it is important to
understand that international law is typically unable to differentiate
between annexation and colonialism. As far as the conventional legal
understanding is concerned, there is 'no general significance in the
distinction between decolonisation, dismemberment, secession, and
annexation' (emphasis in the original, Crawford and Brownlie, 2012).
International law, therefore, views decolonisation mainly as the
correction of an extra-territorial political wrong, rather than through
the lens of its violence and epistemic injustice, which is why such
legal-political perspectives are unable to grasp the core of colonialism
as a legal-political system. There is also another way to consider this.
Political communities have a claim to govern themselves and actualise
their political will (within reason), but they also 'determine
themselves' through the enactment of their own political agency (Renzo,
2019: 351-352; Stilz, 2015: 3-9). There is then a mutual relationship
between individuals' exercise of their individual agency and the
collective agency that they exercise through political institutions. By
participating in 'institutionalised political cooperation', individuals
act simultaneously as group agents as well as individual ones (Renzo,
2019: 356). Stilz labels these as 'maker interests' (Stilz, 2015: 3-9),
which help us shape our lives and identities as individuals and as
members of a political collective. But for these interests to be
actualised, there are two further conditions that need to be fulfilled:
that one is able to act as an agent ('the agency condition'); and that
one is regarded as the author of her conduct ('the authorship
condition') (Renzo, 2019: 356). Renzo argues that the distinct wrong of
colonialism in this view lies in the idea that the colonised subjects
exist as distinct political agents even within the colonial polity; that
even if they participate, with or without their will, in the political
institutions in the colony, they are not regarded as the authors of
their own conduct. And so, while the colonised may fulfil the agency
condition, their acts are not of their own volition within the
structural setting of colonialism. In this situation, forced annexation
would differ from colonialism in that after annexation, the
annexed-subject is subsumed into the polity while the colonial subject
is not. More importantly, the implication here is that while colonialism
curtails my authorship (as I am not the author of my own act),
annexation violates both the authorship and agency conditions: now I am
neither an independent agent, nor an author of my own act, as I am
subsumed within the new and dominant political entity. This creates a
crucial problem. A corollary of this argument would be that annexation
is actually worse than colonialism, as the former denies both authorship
and agency while the latter denies only authorship. But this
value-judgement would not really advance our understanding of either.
What requires more reflection is if the colonised territories and people
were subsumed within the colonial metropolis, whether this would enable
us to label this situation as one of annexation rather than colonialism.
Colonialism would then become an intermediate step towards annexation
which, it is argued here, misses the wider and more significant point of
the encounter between the coloniser and the colonised. This also
completely misses instances such as the colonial-annexation 12 of
Algeria by the French. Political disenfranchisement was reprehensible
without doubt, but what was more problematic was that there was never a
'legal outlet (naturalisation) or religious outlet (conversion)' for the
colonised to ever become equal political members of the society (Memmi,
2021). The division between the colonial subject and a citizen of the
metropolis did not just exist at the political level but at a level
prior, in a more essentialist position. This is why we can see the
difference in the cases of annexation of the Crimea by Russia and that
of Algeria by the French -- in the former case the territory is annexed
for the inclusion of population while, in the latter, the population is
essentially excluded by virtue of colonial inclusion and territorial
appropriation. The Epistemic Injustice of Colonialism Land usurpation
and exclusionary political institutions were and remain grave injustices
and the most apparent manifestations of colonialism. Political
domination highlights the problems associated with direct colonial rule
and disenfranchisement of the colonised, although it is unable to fully
account for the wrong of settler colonialism and land usurpation (Moore,
2016: 450). Territorial injustice, on the other hand, critiques settler
colonialism but is unable to reconcile it with other colonial wrongs.
More importantly, divesting the search for a specific and distinct wrong
from other colonial wrongs, especially its gratuitous violence, leads to
sanitised accounts of colonial wrongdoing. The 'contingency' and
under-theorisation of violence within some critical accounts of
colonialism undermines our theoretical analysis and does a disservice to
the cause of reparative justice (Bufacchi, 2017: 198). Moreover, these
accounts deconstruct colonialism as a problem of territorial or
political rights and focus on the political exchange between the
coloniser and the colonised. In this, they presuppose the colonised
subjects' position as political beings within the colonial project,
whose loss of territorial rights or whose loss of political will can be
identified as the primary injustice caused by colonialism. But the
injustice of colonialism is far more problematic than the loss of
political agency, self-determination or territorial rights. The Kantian
'duty to associate' that Ypi bases the society's reciprocal principles
on does not even become possible within the colonial exchange because of
the absolute 'reluctance to recognise' the colonised subject (Fanon,
2021: 95). Colonialism at its core was an epistemically unjust project,
with an associated socio-cultural, economic and legal-political
manifestation, and which perpetuated and was premised on the assumption
of human inequality. This, it is maintained here, is the foundational as
well as the distinct wrong of colonialism -- it underpins its violence,
territorial usurpation and political exclusion, and it also shaped
colonialism into a distinct socio-political enterprise. Mass
deportations, executions, appropriation of land and resources, rape and
violence associated with colonialism will not have occurred if the
epistemic hierarchies of inequality had not already been created and
accepted. Prior to all these injustices and central to the colonial
project was a denial of the humanity of the colonised. This is why, as
mentioned previously, Fanon considers land as a pathway towards
attaining 'dignity' (Fanon, 2001: 34). This is where the idea of
epistemic injustice becomes important and it is necessary to discuss it
in-depth. Broadly, the idea of epistemic injustice concerns the partial
or complete exclusion of certain groups from the category of knowers.
Miranda Fricker argues that prejudice and identities can be linked with
structural power within a society and can lead to a dismissal
(credibility deficit) or 13 overestimation (credibility excess) of the
speaker's testimony, leading to two categories of epistemic injustice
(Fricker, 2007). At one level, the person I am perceived to be as per my
identity would diminish my credibility as a knower/speaker due to the
prejudice and stereotypes that the society holds about me (Fricker,
2007: 9-29). This testimonial injustice has obvious connotations in
relation to courtroom testimonies and ad hominem attacks, among others.
But for the purposes of this paper, the main focus is on personal
characteristics -- colour, caste, creed, gender, lineage, religion,
class background, or just one's perception of me -- all that can be
grouped within a structural-identity power and is independent of my
expertise on any given matter. Testimonial injustice suggests that my
identity-related characteristics limit the weight and believability of
my ideas and testimony. This also resonates with Dotson's notion of
testimonial smothering, which comes from black feminist studies.
Speaking about women's testimonies and tracing her idea of epistemic
injustice directly from Spivak (Spivak, 2010), Dotson indicates that it
is not just a matter of belief in what I say but that, given the
societal and environmental conditions that we inhabit, I may even stop
myself from speaking up, and especially speaking about the injustices
that I face (Dotson, 2011: 242). But Fricker suggests that operating
even prior to this, there is another level to epistemic justice that
pertains to the collective interpretive resources in a society. This
hermeneutical injustice occurs when 'some significant area of one's
social experience \[is\] obscured from collective understanding' because
of structural-identity and its association with power and institutions
(Fricker, 2007: 155). This wrong is therefore about the marginalisation
of certain individuals or groups through a denial of their ways of
perceiving or engaging with the world using one particular vantage point
as a marker. While testimonial injustice refers to the exclusion of the
knowledge of the speaker because of the hearer's prejudice, the wrong of
hermeneutical injustice is about the 'exclusion from the pooling of
knowledge owing to structural identity prejudice in the collective
hermeneutical resource' (Fricker, 2007: 162). It is evident that many
communities within contemporary societies face epistemic injustices
either through direct discrimination or through a denial of their
individual and collective practices. People outside gender binaries,
religious and ethnic minorities within certain countries,
differently-abled individuals, migrants and refugees face epistemic
wrongs of various kinds. Assaults on women in peacetime and during
conflicts (MacKinnon, 1994), the marginalisation of their stories due to
preconceived societal notions (Merry, 2006), and the wielding of labels
of 'insanity' and 'madness' against individuals point in a similar
direction. It is not just about societal collection of interpretive
resources but also affects 'the very construction (constitutive and/or
causal) of selfhood' (Fricker, 2007: 168). Hermeneutical injustice
therefore is not a homogenous idea, and the injustices can differ
according to their source, dynamics, depth and breadth (Medina, 2017:
45-47). The epistemic wrong of colonialism, however, goes beyond
Fricker's categorisation. While hermeneutical injustice gives us a lead,
it needs to go further still to capture colonial injustices. It is one
thing to deny an individual or a group's experience from the totality of
societal resources; it is far more problematic to base the societal
foundation on the denial of existence or the knowledge of a group. This
is a subtle but a crucial difference. In the former case, epistemic
injustice is an aberration within the system, a wrong that is recognised
and could be addressed; in the latter, epistemic injustice is a
foundational value that animates the socio-cultural and legal-political
system. This becomes evident when we cast an eye around the world at the
moments after decolonisation -- wherever decolonisation was taken solely
as a correction of political and territorial 14 wrongs, it left behind a
remainder. The case of Apartheid South Africa gives us the clearest
example: a system based on racial prejudice that manifested in its
legal, cultural, political, economic and social spheres; injustice that
was visible in its direct and structural violence, legitimised by the
very operations of the state. The Segregation in the US was not much
different. Although the US overthrew the 'colonial regime' in 1779, the
subjugation of the native population and of generations of enslaved
people continued (legally in most cases), at least until the Civil
Rights struggle. This is also what we see in the treatment of minorities
in much of the postcolonial world where, despite political
decolonisation and the mitigation of some territorial and political
wrongs, epistemic differences remain or are projected on to other
marginalised groups. The writings of the colonial era give us a further
indication of the prejudice that featured into legalpolitical principles
and consequently impacted practice. Locke, for instance, drew parallels
between the mental capacities of children, the mentally
differently-abled and 'savages' (the enslaved and the colonised), none
of whom were considered to have enough 'reason' to govern their own
political affairs and were therefore to be kept apart from civil(ised)
society (Arneil, 2012: 499). Writing about his categorisation of the
'savage', children and 'mentally disabled', Arneil mentions how Locke
argued of a crucial difference between the former and the rest: that the
colonised are only 'subject to the life/death power of the masters'
while the latter could be dealt with by Christian principles of charity
(Arneil, 2012: 501). Vitoria, similarly, wrote of the Native Americans
that '"although not totally mad", \[they\] could be considered "so close
to being mad that they are unsuited to setting up or administering a
commonwealth both legitimate and ordered in human and civil terms"'
(quoted in Ypi, 2013: 168). This epistemic wrong of assumed human
inequality consequently lay at the foundation of the institutions thus
established during the colonial periods. It was present within the
claiming of Indian territories after 1757 by the East India Company, and
in the selling of opium to China over the barrel of a gun by the same
merchant corporation; it is what guided the voyages of 'discovery' by
the Spanish conquistadors in the 15th century and the Scramble for
Africa in the 19th century; it dictated the executions and capture of
populations in the Belgian Congo and the Transatlantic Slave Trade
across centuries. It is therefore important to understand what the idea
of colonialism's epistemic injustice represents. Épistémè allows the
creation of a subset of acceptability and credibility within the wider
set of possibility in a discursive environment -- it is the '"apparatus"
which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but
of what may or may not be characterised as scientific' and therefore
acceptable (Foucault et al., 1980). It is a discursive organisational
scheme that allows the separation of 'among all the statements which are
possible those that will be acceptable within' on the basis of some
alleged rules of 'scientificity' (Foucault et al., 1980: 197).
Colonialism's epistemic wrong involved the establishment of a world in
which the socially constructed epistemic hierarchies were naturalised
and reified. In this image of the world, both the coloniser and the
colonised were and still are convinced of the differences between the
civilised and the barbarian, between the human and the sub/non-human. It
is a world in which power disparities were normalised and even claimed
as natural categories; they are cloaked within a said scientificity and
essentialised (on normalisation of power, see Foucault, 2009). The
prejudice associated with these classifications of knowledges and racial
hierarchies undermines, not just the belief in what the speaker/knower
utters, but the very possibility of communication and knowing. 15
Writing about a marginalised group within a marginalised one -- about
hindu women within colonised societies, battling against patriarchy as
well as colonialism -- Spivak highlighted the impossibility of the
conditions within which any meaningful communication (both as acts of
speaking and hearing) could even exist (Spivak, 2010: 65). Phrasing this
as epistemic violence, Spivak suggested that the subaltern classes
neither have access to the dominant discourse nor to the revisionist and
critical narratives -- like 'trace-phenomena', they only appear as
markers for others' existence and vanish before they themselves can be
seen or heard. It should be acknowledged that Spivak's subaltern
classes, a term she borrows from Gramsci, does not refer to all the
colonised, even though its insight captures the colonial practice. Also,
injustice and violence may not be interchangeable terms but they are
comparable in how they affect the victims as, from this perspective,
both induce a sense of 'humiliation, vulnerability and powerlessness'
(Bufacchi, 2007: 141). When epistemic injustice reaches such proportion
that there is complete annihilation of conditions of communication (as
Spivak warns us), there exists the condition of 'hermeneutical death'.
Under these conditions, there is a complete disengagement between the
colonised and the meaning-making practices of the wider society (Medina,
2017: 50). In this situation -- of hermeneutical death or subalternity
(Spivak) -- the speaking subject ceases to be recognised (or even exist)
as a knower. This is not just about silencing or disbelieving the voices
of the marginalised, but as if the voices of the colonised never even
existed. This is a system marked by 'monoculture of knowledge', (de
Sousa Santos, 2007: 76), by coloniality of power and knowledge (Quijano,
2000; Mignolo, 2007), or by 'positional superiority of western
knowledge' (Tuhiwai Smith, 2021: 67), which was the hallmark of European
colonialism. Colonialism being an epistemic injustice does not mean that
it was merely a non-material wrong or a psychological construct without
a physical manifestation. The creation of cultural and racial divisions
and embedding them within socio-political and legal structures imbibes
them with material consequences. This materiality was evident for all
who wish to see, as the horrors of enslavement, genocide, dispossession
and subjugation cannot be removed from this epistemic construct (on the
horrors of rubber production in Belgium-controlled Congo, see
Hochschild, 2012: 150-166). Reflecting on Orientalism -- the
sociological and theoretical construction of the pre/post-colonial East
in a certain image to justify its subjugation -- Said noted that it is
not a mere 'structure of lies and myths, which, were the truth about
them to be told, would simply blow away' (Said, 2003: 6). Orientalism,
which was in a sense the visible spectrum of the colonial epistemic
construct within the literary discourse, was always situated within a
range of political, social, economic and cultural institutions 'that
retain a vested socioeconomic interest in preserving the validity and
relevance of the placement of "the East" or "the Orient" as the Other to
"the West"' (Pitts, 2017: 152). The epistemic wrong of colonialism is
therefore inevitably sociolegal, cultural, political and material in
nature. It is not just the belief in one's superiority on the basis of
some idea of group membership when it comes to ethnicity, history,
heritage, knowledge, etc., that is an epistemic wrong -- it is the
continuation of this very logic to ultimately the denial of the
colonised as knowers. This meant that the contact between the coloniser
and the colonised/enslaved not a political exchange, but only one of
subjugation and domination. Césaire's damning definition of the
phenomenon captured it many decades ago: 'Colonialism = Thingification'
(Césaire, 2000: 42). It is important to understand that this conversion
of people into things (and instruments of production) was not done
randomly, but the dividing line fell where the markers of appearances,
16 cultures and knowledges were turned into racial, pseudo-scientific
and civilisational schisms; where and through which colonial power then
manifested itself. This is the reason why Fanon suggested that Marxist
analysis of exploitation needed to be stretched to account for this
basic tenet of colonialism (Fanon, 2001: 31). It is also significant to
understand that these epistemic constructs, through the action of the
socio-political and structural power present in the colonised societies,
were internalised by the colonised, further blurring the boundary
between the operation of these epistemic injustices. Bhargava notes how
the epistemic injustice of colonialism not only included the
'inferiorisation of indigenous cultures' but also marginalised and
transformed the epistemic frameworks of indigenous people through
intentional actions and structural configurations (Bhargava, 2013: 415).
Fanon, who was also a trained psychiatrist and recorded testimonies of
people suffering from psychological disorders due to colonial encounters
and liberation struggles, wrote about the 'psycho-pathology' of the
colonised ('Colonial Wars and Mental Disorders' in Fanon, 2001). With
the colonised envisioning themselves as part of the European
civilisation yet always excluded from it -- unable to step out of their
identity which became synonymous with barbarity and wretchedness -- the
colonised subject is split within himself (Fanon, 2021: 167-170). Du
Bois had termed this the 'double consciousness' of the colonised, where
he always looks at himself from the gaze of the coloniser, unable to
become the master yet never quite able to escape the epistemic
constructs around his enslavement (Hinchey, 2018: 9). With epistemic
positions created as such, the mercantile and corporate politics of
colonialism became that much easier to manage. A rejection of political,
social and cultural being of the colonised made it possible and easier
to turn him into an 'instrument of production' as a labourer, a
plantation worker or a peasant, or even enslave him as a commodity.
'Between the coloniser and the colonised', Césaire noted, 'there is room
only for forced labour, intimidation, pressure, the police, taxation,
theft, rape, compulsory crops, contempt, mistrust, arrogance,
self-complacency, swinishness, brainless elites, degraded masses'
(Césaire, 2000: 42). Colonised were only included in the fold as
instruments of production or as slaves and servants -- as things. There
was no political or societal existence for them outside of this relation
of injustice. Their life began in a situation of 'hermeneutical death'
and fixity (Medina, 2017: 50; Fanon, 2021: 95). Even if all other wrongs
of colonialism are momentarily ignored, this denial of the humanity and
conversion of the colonial subject into an object would still remain the
gravest injustice of colonialism. The colonised and the enslaved had no
independent reality or 'ontological resistance' in the eyes of the
coloniser, for they only existed in relation to the coloniser (Fanon,
2021: 90). The various scholars mentioned above have approached the
problem of colonialism through the diversity of their opinions and
scholarly traditions. The discussion has not sought to simplify or
homogenise their arguments, but highlight that one common thread,
amongst others, that runs through these is the insight about epistemic
wrong and the violence that it manifests. The epistemic wrong of
colonialism lies in the denial of equal claim to humanity and equal
claim to produce knowledge, decide on political self-rule, among its
other variations. This epistemic wrong had a territorial manifestation
(in the usurpation of foreign territories as terra nullius), political
manifestation (coercive establishment of political communities,
disenfranchisement and systems of unequal citizenship), cultural
manifestation (racial hierarchies and a rejection of equal claim to
knowledge), legal manifestation (using legality and legitimacy for
disenfranchisement and refusal of equal rights) and a manifestation with
regard to human dignity. This was neither incidental nor peripheral to
the colonial enterprise but emerged prior to and fed the colonial
project and, 17 therefore, it is important to recognise how this
epistemic injustice rendered colonialism into a distinct political
system. Concluding Remarks This paper took equal human dignity as its
starting point. Equality and equity acknowledge differences between
individuals and do not require sameness, but they also demand a
recognition of basic and inherent human dignity and worth for everyone,
which are violated by racialised hierarchies, monocultures of knowledge,
and any claims of inherent group superiority. A difference of opinion in
this regard cannot simply be resolved by an academic treatise on the
subject and is more suited to public discourses and political struggles
which this article would not be able to do justice to. Taking this
equality as a given, there are three main things that the paper has
discussed. First, it highlighted the need to search for colonialism's
distinct wrong, suggesting that this is an important step for bolstering
the conceptual foundations of the field as well as furthering the
possibilities of redress from this historical injustice. Second, it
argued that territorial usurpation and political disenfranchisement were
grave colonial wrongdoings but are not its distinctive injustices, due
to the heterogeneity of colonialism as well as the centrality of
violence within the colonial project. Finally, the paper discussed how
colonialism was at its core an epistemically unjust system, which
violated the knowledge and meaning-making practices of the colonised and
undermined any possibility of communication, political existence and
equality for the colonised and the enslaved.

\[SHRUNK TEXT\-\--NONE REMOVED\]

At the end of this paper, it is important to dwell for a moment on what
this means for the field of law and colonialism at large, and for the
various calls for decolonisation. The way in which most national
liberation movements were framed and how wider postcolonial politics
panned out has shaped our understanding of how we perceive colonialism.
Political agency and self-determination are recognised as central to
decolonisation mainly because they are more easily translatable and
understandable within the discourses at the metropoles, and fit our
legal-political frames. A diminished understanding of the epistemic
logic of colonialism is an indictment of the deficiencies of our
conventional theoretical framings and political languages. A turn to
decolonisation could only be achieved if colonisation itself was
understood and challenged as being more than the sum of its various
manifestations.

**[Reparations]{.underline}** and corrections for colonial wrongdoing
focusing primarily on monetary compensation or even return of land [will
never be sufficient]{.underline}. They are important avenues to redress
some harms of colonialism, but could not be the end goal of
decolonisation. Similarly, [enfranchisement]{.underline}, inclusion in
voting and representation are significant measures, but [cannot
substitute the need for socio-political systems that could **dismantle**
the foundations of racial, sociocultural **and epistemic
injustices**]{.underline}. This means that dealing with racism,
xenophobia, institutional or societal discrimination, and discourses
that perpetuate human inequality at local and global scales, are not
just important in and of themselves but are also key facets for
corrective justice. If colonialism was epistemically unjust,
decolonisation has to be more than inclusion, diversity, and
restitution. Tokenistic presence of southern voices within the very
frames that shaped and benefited from colonialism can only further the
logic -- the 'scientificity' -- of the episteme that undermined the
truth value and credibility of southern epistemologies. [Epistemic
justice requires]{.underline}, 18 at the very minimum, [a new set
of]{.underline} significant **[questions asked]{.underline}** [from the
various vantage points of the colonised, the enslaved and the
dispossessed; it requires questions, the answers to which **are yet to
be thought**.]{.underline}

[Critical theory]{.underline} remains relevant in a number of ways. Not
only does it [provide]{.underline} us with the [**insights** to critique
the **limitations of positivist approaches**]{.underline}, but it also
[offers potentially **practical ways** of working from critical
international theory to a critical theory of international
relations]{.underline}. Perhaps more than any other theorist, Habermas
continues [to inspire critical international theorists to develop the
causal and constitutive pathways for understanding the shifting dynamics
of **international institutions**, including **international law,**
**diplomacy**, and **war**.]{.underline} But overextending critical
theory in a policy and practical direction, as we saw, can also pose the
challenge of sustaining critical theory's power of critique. If, for
instance, we address its role [in the environmental
movement]{.underline}, we might say that scientific rationality also
contains a darker side or contradiction that environmentalists are
unwilling to address: that [scientific **rationality**]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} actually **[repress]{.underline}** [the political
**consciousness**]{.underline} [needed to **promote political
unity**]{.underline} [and solidarity in an age of
globalization.]{.underline}

Indeed, [globalization]{.underline}, in this sense, cuts in two ways.
[It can allow us to extend the emancipatory struggle beyond the nation
state; but it can also challenge the development of solidarity and
political unity that is necessary for promoting deliberation and/or
deliberative democracy (Pensky 2005). This contradiction]{.underline}
**[need not be undermining]{.underline}**, but rather seen as the reason
for inquiring further into the repressive effects of state rule. In this
respect, there will remain open-ended issues with which critical
international theorists will continue to grapple, including whether we
are working towards an open and responsive global civil society, and
whether [global institutions and technological advances are helping to
address the needs of marginalized and oppressed peoples]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the rapidly growing influence of the social media suggests that
while more individuals are equipped with an unprecedented means
empowerment]{.underline}, it may also be these means of empowerment that
prevents a longterm sustainable and cohesive political discourse (as the
social media encourages its users to move rapidly from one issue to
another).

Nonetheless, as long as **[dogmatism]{.underline}** and
**[orthodoxy]{.underline}** continue to exist, so too will the
[need]{.underline} for **[critical theory]{.underline}** [to expose the
traits of these oppressive discourses in international
relations.]{.underline} This should always give pause, on the one hand,
for fi xing our assumptions about social and political reality. On the
other hand, it should give further reason to return to the fi
rst-generation Frankfurt School theorists, in particular their emphasis
on the dialectical imagination. After all, [it is the imagination that
allows one to connect the social purpose of ideas and creative faculties
with the radical desire for social change. It is also this imaginative
dimension that reflects how the emancipatory project in IR remains an
open-ended struggle for equality and justice: an emerging project of a
critical theory of international relations that can help us to further
understand and address **institutional novelties and
crises**.]{.underline}

#### Critique alone solves\-\--we don't intend to [fight fire with fire]{.underline} by [fiating in]{.underline} a world of care, but criticism of fearmongering forefronts [genuine]{.underline} scrutiny that makes us as people [more likely]{.underline} to solve [extinction]{.underline}.

only an obscure philosophical subfield, it might not warrant this

My second argument goes further, I want to consider the possibility that
the [securitization]{.underline} against identity threats, which [would
ensure the ontological security of some]{.underline}, **[is not
categorically a bad thing]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the same can be
morally permissible]{.underline}, [and at times even]{.underline}
**[morally required]{.underline}**. It is fair to say that in the
relevant literature (securitization studies and ontological security
studies) very few scholars would consider securitization and identity
through this lens. Indeed, [the widely shared view that securitization
is mostly a negative thing, something to be avoided in favour of
desecuritization]{.underline} (broadly political solutions), [is tightly
bound up with unease over the securitization against identity issues by
some actors]{.underline} ([the EU, Trump etc]{.underline}.). In the EU,
securitization has allowed the drowning of migrants in the Mediterranean
(Alkopher, 13). Moreover, the language-focused security scholars'
inadvertent role in the social construction of this reality places
additional need to speak up in favour of desecuritization (Huysmans, 28;
Taureck, 50). It is therefore no surprise that security scholars take a
dim view of securitization against identity concerns as an ontological
security seeking tool (cf. Browning et al., 6, see also Lerner, 40). In
this context, Maria Mälksoo (41) makes a noteworthy point. She argues,
not only that the rationale of ontological security problematically
justifes the securitization of (read: against) identity, but also that
this logic makes securitization inevitable. In what follows I want to
take on some of these points. To do this, I draw liberally on Just
Securitization theory (Floyd, 2019) that develops criteria when
securitization is morally permissible, by drawing on the Just war
theory.

I want to begin my challenge of the orthodoxy by suggesting that [it
does not do to dismiss the fears of majorities as unwarranted simply
because they are, well, in the majority.]{.underline} Majority status
is, after all, a matter of perspective. Viewed from a global perspective
localised majorities (e.g., in their respective countries, indigenous
Germans, Swedes, or Danes) are globally scarce, hence minorities.
Consequently, we can no longer say that 'majorities' are always in a
position of strength and hence secure. Indeed, localised majorities are
no less entitled to being worried that their respective primary
identities are threatened when faced with rapid change (notably, but not
exclusively, by high levels of immigration) to their societies. After
all, globally there is only one Denmark, Sweden, and Germany and so on!
While such an intersubjective fear may give rise to securitization, it
does not automatically justify recourse to securitization (cf. below).
However, neither is it the case that securitization against threats to
identity can never be morally justifed. Elsewhere I have (Floyd 18)
shown that [securitization is morally permissible if there is a **real
and existential threat**]{.underline} [to a referent object that is
morally valuable]{.underline}, [that the securitizing actor is sincere
in their intentions, that securitization is a proportionate response to
the threat, and that securitization has a **better chance of achieving**
the just cause than other less harmful options]{.underline} ([notably
politicisation]{.underline}). While these thresholds are high, we can
see that it is in principle possible that the securitization against
identity threats, including against minority groups could be morally
permissible.

Assuming, for the sake of argument, that this is correct, what are the
implications from this for the policymaking world and practitioners? One
implication of this is that [policymakers and elites cannot **simply
dismiss** calls for the securitization against identity threats made by
individuals who fear for their ontological security as morally
wrong]{.underline}, [ill-informed, ignorant, and dangerous.]{.underline}
[Instead, they should evaluate claims regarding the **threat level**
carefully and objectively, and if necessary, **act on the
issue**.]{.underline} Acting here does not mean securitization, it
merely means that [relevant political action is taken to ensure the
societal security of people]{.underline}. This is especially important
for elites ideologically opposed to the securitization against identity
threats, who would not wish to let things deteriorate to the point where
securitization is the best option.

The importance of acting is crucial for a second reason. Notably, [if
governments]{.underline} **[fail to act]{.underline}** [on an
**objective existential threat** to its people]{.underline} (or parts
thereof) [the social contract that otherwise binds people and their
government is annulled, giving nonstate actors **permission to
securitize**]{.underline} (Floyd, 20, 18: 146--7. See also Fabre, 15:
148 and Wolfendale, 55: 261). Any state leadership must have an interest
in preventing that eventuality. I suggest that the way to prevent this
is to take ontological and societal security seriously. It is important
to note that although this article allows room for the just
securitization of identity, the argument does not rest on the view that
ontological security (i.e. the condition of having a stable sense of
self) is objectively valuable.11 [Just securitization theory specifes
that only referent objects that meet basic human needs]{.underline}
(specifcally autonomy and physical), [and that 'respect the needs of
outsiders' are morally justifable and eligible for self or other defence
via securitization]{.underline} (Floyd, 18: 100). [This is **based on
the 'humanistic principle'**]{.underline} [which holds that a thing's
value rests on its 'contribution, actual or]{.underline} possible, to
human life and its [quality']{.underline} (Raz 44: 194). Concretely this
means that [the moral value of any given ontological security is only as
valuable as is the identity/self it refers to]{.underline}. [The
Hindutva movement]{.underline} in contemporary India, for instance,
[is]{.underline} **[valueless]{.underline}** (read: immoral), [because
it is built on **intentionally infringing other people's (here Muslims)
basic human needs**]{.underline} (cf. Kinnvall, 33).

Conclusion

As part of this special edition this article is concerned with
explaining the puzzle why majorities sometimes feel threatened by
minority groups. In line with the brief provided by its editors, I have
in this research focused on ontological security to answer this
question. Throwing the analytical net wide, however, I have suggested
that the case study is an opportunity to examine the putative diferences
between on the one hand ontological security, and the Copenhagen
school's societal security on the other. This was justifed because both
concepts focus on identity, and for the unversed it is not always clear
what these two distinct theoretical concepts bring to the table that is
not already covered by the other concept. In particular, once we realise
that ontological security speaks to individuals and states and that
societal security (albeit under the label identity security) does too.

This research has shown that while both concepts are about identity,
they inhabit diferent spaces in the security equation. In a nutshell,
securitization and societal security explain that relevant actors
construct identity as a threat, while ontological security can explain
why individual persons, who have multiple identities, assent to
securitization. Assent here is meant to capture that individuals can
fulfl diferent functions in the securitization process, in this context
most notably audience, securitization requester and functional actor
(Floyd, 19). Ontological security and societal security are as such
distinct but complementary concepts. This is an important fnding; it can
end or forestall possible claims of analytical superiority among
securitization scholars and ontological security scholars. Moreover,
although much work has been done on the audience in securitization, this
work usually focuses on who the audience is, or on the contextual
factors that make securitization likely, not so much on why audiences'
consent to securitization. As such this article is a signifcant
contribution to securitization studies. Beyond this, its fndings are
also important for ontological security studies. Out of a whole range of
security theories, [ontological security uniquely can explain what --
beyond physical needs -- motivates individuals' decision to fght
fguratively or literally.]{.underline}

Second, the research disputed the in the literature standard view that
ontological security seeking via securitization is necessarily a
negative development. By invoking Just Securitization Theory (Floyd, 18,
20) I argued that the picture is much more nuanced. The securitization
of identity can be morally justifable, provided there is a real threat,
that the referent object is morally justifable and so on. The article
also considers the implications of the research argument for the
policymaking world. In ontological security studies this is not always a
feature of research papers, many of which can be highly specialised and
theoretically dense. By contrast, this research shows that [the concept
of ontological security is important for policymakers and
practitioners.]{.underline} Although I discuss with (1) how to [pre-empt
securitization]{.underline} [and]{.underline} (2) [just
securitization,]{.underline} two quite distinct issues, [the discussion
converges on the same message]{.underline}. Namely, [take ontological
security as seriously as physical security]{.underline}, [not only for
the sake and well-being of the people living in the state, but also for
the well-being of state]{.underline} (notably a failure to act on
ontological security concerns can result in a justifed backlash). [The
overall message being that while securitization]{.underline} against
identity threats may sometimes [be morally permissible, **pre-emption of
insecurity** giving rise to securitization, is **still a better
option.**]{.underline}

How often do you think about the end of the world? Some people think
about it quite a bit. Within Effective Altruism circles, many people
share a concern for the future of humanity. Effective Altruists attempt
to combine good intentions with science and reasoning to find the best
ways to do good, whether for humans or non-human animals. **[Mitigation
of so-called "existential risks" is]{.underline}** a **[huge
priority]{.underline}** for some of their more risk-seeking members. An
existential risk, put simply, is some class of [possible event that
presents a risk of extinction to humanity]{.underline}. Nick Bostrom,
Oxford philosopher and existential risk extraordinaire, defines it this
way: "One where an [adverse outcome would]{.underline} either
[annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or
**permanently**]{.underline} and drastically **[curtail its
potential]{.underline}**." Some main classes of existential risk include
[catastrophic climate change, malicious a]{.underline}rtificial
super[i]{.underline}ntelligence, the [emergence of malicious
nanotech]{.underline}nology, **[nuclear war]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} malicious [bio-tech]{.underline}, among others. When
considering the threats posed by so-called "x-risks," there are at least
three factors to keep in mind. First, bear in mind that if [humanity
continues for the foreseeable future]{.underline}, then the [number of
potential **people in the future will be significantly
higher**]{.underline} [than]{.underline} the [number who exist
today]{.underline} or have existed in the past. Additionally, the
expected [disutility of extinction-level events is massive]{.underline},
meaning that [even a small mitigation of those probabilities results in
a **huge positive**]{.underline}. Per one interpretation of the
evidence, "even if we use the most conservative of these estimates... we
find that the [expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater
than]{.underline} the value of **[10\^16 human lives]{.underline}**.
This implies that the expected value of [reducing]{.underline}
[existential risk by]{.underline} a mere [one millionth of one
percentage point]{.underline} [is]{.underline} at least a **[hundred
times the value of a million human lives]{.underline}**." If this holds
even remotely true, then surely we should keep listening. Second,
consider that some [experts]{.underline} [believe]{.underline} the
[probability of extinction-level events is]{.underline} somewhat
[high.]{.underline} In a report released by Oxford's Future of Humanity
Institute, a [survey of experts found]{.underline} the likelihood of
extinction by the year 2100 to be [a whopping **19
percent**]{.underline}. While this number should be taken with a grain
of salt, it is unsettling that people in the know are so pessimistic
about our odds. Third, bear in mind that there are very, [very few
people]{.underline} [dedicated to mitigating]{.underline} these
[existential risks.]{.underline} [Some limited efforts exist, but they
are low-staffed]{.underline} and underfunded. As Nick Bostrom has noted,
even "a million dollars could currently make a vast difference to the
amount of research done on existential risks; the same amount spent on
furthering world peace would be like a drop in the ocean." [If you're
looking for a cause with a funding gap, this might be just the
ticket]{.underline}. Looking throughout history, [we can find **plenty
of examples of near-nuclear war**;]{.underline} the Future of Life
Institute compiled a nice list of the most notable. What this might show
us is that our [planet has almost faced near-extinction level events in
the past.]{.underline} One reason we are all still here is because
people worked to craft systems that would avoid careless mistakes or
oversights. In other words, we built systems that attempted to mitigate
these risks. If these systems had not been in place, and lazy fail-safes
failed to prevent disaster, then what would have happened? Perhaps not
outright extinction, but disaster indeed. During the Cold War, the
notion of "mutually assured destruction" was not some abstract; it was a
working possibility, one that humanity had to take seriously. So today[,
in a world with ever-advancing technology and geopolitical uncertainty,
we **lack a compelling reason not to take these sorts of risks
seriously**]{.underline}. The [need to mitigate existential risk
stands]{.underline} or falls with free will---if it does not exist, then
there is little or no case to be made. But if it does---even to an
extent---then [we have every reason to at least listen to the
**experts**]{.underline}. So, perhaps my thesis is that insofar as a
person believes humans have free will (i.e. a degree of autonomy over
their destinies), he or she likely will have reason to support causes
that mitigate the risks imposed by disaster scenarios. This is not meant
to take a stand on cause prioritization. It might be more worthwhile
still to donate to groups that fight global health problems or empower
people economically. However, excluding opportunity cost, [donating time
or money to mitigating these threats is]{.underline} likely [net
positive,]{.underline} depending on the efficacy of the organization or
project. [Given that we have not observed]{.underline} an [existential
threat play]{.underline} [out]{.underline} in the past, [**we might be
biased** towards believing that one might never emerge]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [this]{.underline} is an [area where rational thinking is
absolutely essential]{.underline}. In my view, whether or not to support
or donate to these causes is an open question. But [if the **whole of
humanity is at stake**, it is at least a conversation worth
having.]{.underline}

HDCSW-Packet

In chapter four, "Biosecurity Noir: WMDs in a World without Borders,"
Masco singles out concrete evidence of the amplification of the
invisible biothreat triggered by the receipt of a few anthrax letters in
2001 to support his argument about the made-up ambiguous link to WMD.
[The author highlights that]{.underline} by [proliferating visions
(**depictions**) of catastrophic danger]{.underline}, biosecurity
**[create]{.underline}**d [a militarized response]{.underline} [**of
global preemption** in the name of domestic defense]{.underline}. Masco
argues his case well and sharply, providing compelling evidence, but his
interpretations of evidence at times seems exaggerated and biased.
Though Masco does not deny the existence of the real threats, his
recognition of them is too brief, while consideration of an alternative
view is rather weak. He acknowledges that terrorist violence is not
fictitious but insists that for the most part the United States inflated
threats and politically exploited potential danger to declare and
maintain the state of emergency. Such focus on the amplification of
threats seems to suggest that for the most part the threats are not that
real. Masco suggests that the link between terrorists and WMD is mainly
inflated. [**Yet** there is a **real global concern**]{.underline} about
2,000 tons of highly-radioactive nuclear materials being stored in
poorly secured civilian locations around the world. The book never
mentions the threat of a dirty bomb, which today is viewed as a more
likely occurrence than an atomic bomb explosion. The IAEA cites a
hundred reported thefts of nuclear materials on average each year. There
is a good chance terrorists can get their hands on enough nuclear
materials to produce a dirty bomb. The United States meets these
challenges with increased international cooperation. Masco's [main
argument that "the US is no longer constrained by **territorial
limits**" is **exaggerated**.]{.underline} The only two cases cited when
the United States appeared unconstrained were the invasion of Iraq.
Though the invasion of Iraq was opposed by some U.S. allies (France,
Germany, and New Zealand), it was still a combined force coalition from
the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Poland. [The **U**nited
**S**]{.underline}tates [does not have]{.underline} an **[unrestricted
reach]{.underline}** as Masco wants to depict. [It is constrained by
sovereignty and territorial integrity of other stable
states.]{.underline} The unstable [nuclear regimes in **North Korea**
and **Iran** present that **existential** nuclear
**threat**]{.underline} to the U.S. [described]{.underline} by Masco,
[but the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is in **no
rush to invade**]{.underline} these countries. According to
[the]{.underline} anticipatory and preemptive logic Masco prescribes to
the United States, it could have already invaded those states to prevent
the disaster. Another limitation of his **[argument]{.underline}** is
that he [paints]{.underline} the nuclear and [counterterror]{.underline}
states [as consistent]{.underline} [through all]{.underline} the
[presidencies]{.underline}, thus, [drawing all administrations under **a
common denominator**. Under Obama, the]{.underline} counterterror state
became a liberal democracy again. The '**[unrestrained'
theater]{.underline}** [of operation]{.underline} [has shrunk by ending
the presence in Iraq and withdrawing from **Afghanistan**]{.underline},
[even though our presence there could have been **extended** based on
the **preemption logic**]{.underline}. Obama recognized the faults of
the Bush administration in acting unilaterally, scaled back stability
operations, and emphasized sharing the costs and responsibilities of
global leadership. The emergence of the real ISIL threat undermines the
book's core argument of threat amplification, the U.S. preemption logic
of response, and unconstrained global reach. The U.S.-led global effort
against ISIL amounts to more than 50 nations, which shows the unified
nature of the fight. Masco asserts that U.S. superpower depends on the
ability of the state to monopolize a discourse of danger, but he doesn't
discuss how the United States succeeded in doing that. Masco could have
developed his argument by tracing how the United States was able to use
its soft power to mobilize like-minded states to agree with U.S.
hegemony on WOT. It will be interesting to trace the U.S.
internalization of fear and terror. He could have examined how allies
responded to U.S. domestic mobilization of its population and whether
other states imitated U.S. emotional management projects to mobilize
their own populations. This would boost his argument that the U.S. was
able to project its power on the global scale. In Theatre of Operations,
Masco makes a compelling argument about the creation of the unrestrained
theater of operations via domestication of fear and terror carried over
from the Cold War days. His anthropological study reveals the extent to
which a democracy is willing to use fear to assure the core principle of
the social contract, defined by Hobbes as the exchange of public
obedience for collective security. A democracy that chooses to be
preoccupied with security risks to forgo core democratic values
resulting in the lack of transparency, restriction of free flow of
information, and negligence of non-military threats---no less
threatening than nuclear terrorism. Making [**criticism** of U.S.
actions]{.underline} the main focus of the book, however, Masco's
interpretations [are **not** properly **balanced** and]{.underline}
sometimes [appear **biased**]{.underline}. Still, reading Masco's
insight of the purpose of U.S. actions in the post-9/11 context offers
opportunities to think critically about the effects of 9/11 emotional
reprogramming of society and state of emergencies in U.S. history.

#### 5. IR Scenario analysis unlocks an [intellectual openness]{.underline} to overcome [cognitive biases]{.underline} and incorporate [complementary theories]{.underline} while making research policy-relevant

Added-**[value of scenario analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to **fill the gap**
between **IR theory** and **real-world problems**]{.underline}, "an
increasing number of [scholars]{.underline} have come to [embrace a
spirit of **intellectual openness**, recognizing both the need for
**greater flexibility** in the **theoretical formulations** and the
**possibility of complementarity** by **other theories** and
approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12). [This]{.underline} section discusses
the [added value of scenario analysis as a **complementary approach** to
**traditional IR methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious advantage of
**scenario analysis as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [lies]{.underline} by definition [in its
ability to **tackle future events**.]{.underline} As mentioned before,
[there are no specified instruments within traditional IR methods which
would allow scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The
only exception is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which
is, however, distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [this method is helpful for **overcoming** enduring **cognitive
biases**---mental errors such as **linearity**, **presentism**, and
**group think** caused by the **subconscious** and **simplified
information processing of humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111--
112). [Humans have the tendencies to focus on the present at the expense
of the future and to think about the future in linear terms by
extrapolating past trends into the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992)
points out, "we tend to bias our historical and our theoretical analyses
too much toward continuity (...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to
[introduce **discontinuities into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt
to determine what causes them to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if
Gaddis does not explicitly mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts
underlying scenario approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis
attends to "**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions**
about **continuous** and **linear patterns of
development**"]{.underline} (Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The
[**process of scenario development** invites the participants to
**reveal** and **question convictions** which have **so far remained
unchallenged**, and to **question the linearity of world
developments**.]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [foresight helps IR scholars to **exit** the
**tunnel vision** on world affairs and discover potentially valuable
nonlinear lines of development. These can be both **innovative** in
terms of **scholarship**, and **policy-relevant** by offering a
**reflection** on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline} Thus, [it
can facilitate the **intellectual capability** to **think the
unthinkable**]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[innovative research topics **confront the uncertainties** that are
**crucial for policymakers** to be monitored closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[possibility to **accommodate multiple driving forces**, to **take into
account different values** they might take and finally to **combine them
with each other** and **see how they affect the dependent variable**,
makes the scenario approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work
with a limited number of independent variables]{.underline}, formulate
and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single
causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and providing academia with a tool for "**actionable
clarity** in **understanding contemporary global issues**"]{.underline}
(p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [scenario analysis can be perceived as a tool towards **more
exchange between academia and policy-making** that can contribute to a
**better understanding between the two** worlds. For policymakers, it
provides the opportunity to consider **long-term trends**]{.underline}
(an occasion not often found in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For
academics, it provides insight into which trends are most concerning for
policy-makers, allowing them to check and ultimately enhance the
**relevance of their research agendas**.]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

8\. [Global ethics must respond to mass extinction]{.underline}. In late
2014, the Worldwide Fund for Nature reported a startling statistic:
according to their global study, 52% of species had gone extinct between
1970 and 2010.60 This is not news: [for three decades, conservation
biologists have been warning of a 'sixth mass extinction', which, by
definition, could eliminate more than three quarters of currently
existing life forms in just a few centuries]{.underline}.61 In other
words, [it could threaten the practical possibility of the survival of
earthly life. Mass extinction is not simply extinction (or death) writ
large]{.underline}: **[it is a qualitatively different phenomena that
demands its own ethical categories.]{.underline}** [It cannot be grasped
by aggregating species extinctions,]{.underline} let alone the deaths of
individual organisms. [Not only does it erase diverse, irreplaceable
life forms]{.underline}, [their **unique histories** and **open-ended
possibilities**, but it **threatens the ontological conditions of
Earthly life**.]{.underline}¶ IR is one of few disciplines that is
explicitly devoted to the pursuit of survival, yet it has almost nothing
to say in the face of a possible mass extinction event.62 It utterly
lacks the conceptual and ethical frameworks necessary to foster diverse,
meaningful responses to this phenomenon. As mentioned above, [Cold-War
era concepts such as 'nuclear winter' and 'omnicide' gesture towards
harms massive in their scale and moral horror]{.underline}. However,
[they are asymptotic: they imagine nightmares of a severely denuded
planet, yet they do not contemplate the **comprehensive negation** that
a mass extinction event entails.]{.underline} In contemporary IR
discourses, where it appears at all, extinction is treated as a problem
of scientific management and biopolitical control aimed at securing
existing human lifestyles.63 Once again, [this approach fails to
recognise the reality of extinction, which is a **matter of being and
nonbeing**, not one of life and death processes.]{.underline}¶
[Confronting the enormity of a possible mass extinction event requires a
total overhaul of human perceptions of what is at stake in the
disruption of the conditions of Earthly life. The question of what is
'lost' in extinction has]{.underline}, since the inception of the
concept of 'conservation', [been addressed in terms of financial
cost]{.underline} and economic liabilities.64 Beyond reducing life to
forms to capital, currencies and financial instruments, the dominant
neoliberal political economy of conservation imposes a homogenising,
Western secular worldview on a planetary phenomenon. [Yet the
**enormity, complexity, and scale** of mass extinction is so huge that
humans need to **draw on every possible resource in order to find ways
of responding**.]{.underline} This means that they need to mobilise
multiple worldviews and lifeways -- including those emerging from
indigenous and marginalised cosmologies. Above all, [it is crucial and
urgent to realise that extinction is a **matter of global
ethics**]{.underline}. [It is not simply an issue of management or
security, or even of particular visions of the good life]{.underline}.
[Instead, it is about staking a claim as to the goodness of life itself.
If it does not fit within the existing parameters of global ethics, then
it is these boundaries that need to change]{.underline}.¶ 9. An
Earth-worldly politics. Humans are worldly -- that is, we are
fundamentally worldforming and embedded in multiple worlds that traverse
the Earth. However, the Earth is not 'our' world, as the grand theories
of IR, and some accounts of the Anthropocene have it -- an object and
possession to be appropriated, circumnavigated, instrumentalised and
englobed.65 Rather, it is a complex of worlds that we share,
co-constitute, create, destroy and inhabit with countless other life
forms and beings.¶ The formation of the Anthropocene reflects a
particular type of worlding, one in which the Earth is treated as raw
material for the creation of a world tailored to human needs. Heidegger
famously framed 'earth' and 'world' as two countervailing, conflicting
forces that constrain and shape one another. We contend that existing
political, economic and social conditions have pushed human worlding so
far to one extreme that it has become almost entirely detached from the
conditions of the Earth. Planet Politics calls, instead, for a mode of
worlding that is responsive to, and grounded in, the Earth. One of these
ways of being Earth-worldly is to embrace the condition of being
entangled. We can interpret this term in the way that Heidegger66 did,
as the condition of being mired in everyday human concerns, worries, and
anxiety, to prolong existence. But, in contrast, [we can and should
reframe it as authors like Karen Barad]{.underline}67 and Donna
Haraway68 have done. To them and many others, ['entanglement' is a
radical, indeed fundamental condition of being-with,]{.underline} or, as
Jean-Luc Nancy puts it, 'being singular plural'.69 [This means that no
being is truly autonomous or separate, whether at the scale of
international politics or of quantum physics.]{.underline} World itself
is singular plural: what humans tend to refer to as 'the' world is
actually a multiplicity of worlds at various scales that intersect,
overlap, conflict, emerge as they surge across the Earth. [World emerges
from the poetics of existence, the collision of energy and matter, the
tumult of agencies, the fusion and diffusion of bonds.]{.underline}¶
[Worlds erupt from, and consist in, the intersection of **diverse forms
of being**]{.underline} -- material and intangible, organic and
inorganic, 'living' and 'nonliving'. [Because of the tumultuousness of
the Earth with which they are entangled,]{.underline} '**[worlds' are
not static, rigid or permanent. They are permeable and
fluid]{.underline}**. [They can be **created**,
**modified**]{.underline} [-- and, of course, destroyed. Concepts of
violence, harm and (in)security that focus only on humans ignore at
their peril the destruction and severance of worlds,]{.underline}70
**[which undermines the conditions of plurality that enables life on
Earth to thrive.]{.underline}**

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **causal** account. But its
**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **speech acts** often seem to be **magical
incantations** that upend normal politics through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **some** securitizing
moves resonate, while others \[are **ignored**\]]{.underline} fall on
deaf ears. [Certainly not all attempts to construct threats
succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of both traditional military
concerns as well as "new" security issues. [Both neoconservatives and
structural realists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[have long insisted that **conflict with China is inevitable**, yet
China has over the last **25 years** been more opportunity than threat
in US political discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent
securitizing moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance
has shifted, and the China threat has started to catch on: **linguistic
processes alone cannot account for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it**. You don't have to subscribe to
a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions important or
to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part
of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the
politics of security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded
an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation,
the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must
be followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as
Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely
rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the
politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a
conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [Absent from this picture are fierce
rhetorical battles, where coalitions counter securitizing moves with
their own appeals that strike more or less deeply at underlying
narratives. Absent as well are the public intellectuals and media, who
question and critique securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not
others), [sometimes to good effect (and sometimes with little
impact)]{.underline}. [The **audience** itself---whether the mass public
or a narrower elite stratum---is **stripped of all
agency**]{.underline}. [Speaking security, even when the performance is
competent, **does not sweep this politics away**]{.underline}. Only by
delving into this politics can we shed light on the mysteries of
securitization. We see rhetorical politics as constituted less by
singular "securitizing moves" than by "contentious conversation"---to
use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end, we would urge securitization
theorists, as we recently have elsewhere, to move towards a "pragmatic"
model that rests on four analytical wagers: that actors are both
strategic and social; that legitimation works by imparting meaning to
political action; that legitimation is laced through with contestation;
and that the power of language emerges through contentious dialogue. We
are heartened that our ambivalence about securitization---the ways in
which we find it by turns appealing and dissatisfying---and our vision
for how to move forward have in the last decade been echoed by (mostly)
European colleagues. These critics have laid out a research agenda that
would, if taken up, produce more satisfying, and more deeply political,
theoretical accounts. In our own work, both individual and collective,
we have tried to advance that research agenda. So long as securitization
theorists resist defining the theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long
as it remains wedded to apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely
to gain a broad following on this side of the pond. [Second,
securitization has been held back by another way in which it is
apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to its Schmittian commitments
and political vision. [Successful securitization, in seminal accounts,
replaces normal patterns of politics with the world of the
exception]{.underline}, in which contest has no place. [They imagine
security as the ultimate trump card. But, in reality, the divide is not
nearly so stark. Security **does not crowd out all other spending
priorities**---or states would spend on nothing but defense and
"securitized" issues. **Nor** does simply declaring something a matter
of national security **guarantee its funding**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} balancing and [hedging strate]{.underline}gy [should
involve options to avoid]{.underline} what Traub rightfully describes as
\"[Armageddon]{.underline}.\" We call for a myriad of conventional
options short of striking the nuclear-armed PRC, in the hope that such a
strategy enhances deterrence in the first place and avoids Armageddon
should deterrence fail. The strategy aims to slow escalation rather than
quicken it. [The idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline} \-- of
turning China into an enemy by treating it as one **[\-- is like a
unicorn]{.underline}**; [it is a make believe creature that still has
its believers. The **U**nited **S**tates has done more than any other
country to \"turn China into a friend]{.underline}\" by [welcoming it
into the international community]{.underline}. Alas**[, China has not
fulfilled this U.S. \"prophesy of friendship]{.underline}**.\" Instead
[China has built what all credible observers call a destabilizing
military that has changed the status quo by holding a gun to Taiwan\'s
head]{.underline} even as Taiwan makes bold attempts at peace, by
[claiming ever more territory in the South China Sea, and]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} [attempting to bully]{.underline} and intimidate
[Japan]{.underline}. Traub asks whether our allies and partners will be
willing to participate in an \"anti-Chinese coalition,\" as he describes
it. As the paper says, [all allies,]{.underline} partners, [and
potential partners are already modernizing their militaries in response
to China.]{.underline} And [t]{.underline}hey will continue to do so
regardless of whether the U.S. pursues what Traub would see as an
\"anti-China\" strategy. [Even laid-back Australia has plans to double
its submarine fleet]{.underline} \-- it is not doing so to defend
against Fiji. The paper argues that [it is time for the United States to
offer more serious assistance so that matters do not get out of
hand.]{.underline} [A strong U.S.]{.underline} presence and [commitment
to the region\'s security can help avoid a]{.underline} regional
**[nuclear arms race]{.underline}**, for example. The United States can
be a force multiplier by providing the intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance that only Washington possesses, and by training, and
equipping our allies and friends. [This]{.underline} strategy [is one
way of beginning to put Asia back in balance as China changes the status
quo. Not doing so]{.underline}, we fear, **[would lead to

[Realism has a long history and many variants, but its core rests on a
straightforward set of ideas]{.underline}. As the name implies, [realism
tries to explain world politics as they **really are**]{.underline},
**[rather than describe how they ought to be]{.underline}**. [For
realists, **power** is the centerpiece of **political
life**]{.underline}: [Although other factors **sometimes** play a
role]{.underline}, [the **key** to understanding politics lies in
focusing on who has power and what they are doing with it]{.underline}.
The Athenians' infamous warning to the Melians captures this perfectly:
**["The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they
must."]{.underline}** Quentin Tarantino couldn't have put it any better.

For realists, [states are the **key actors** in the international
system]{.underline}. [There is **no central authority** that can protect
states from one another, so each state **must rely upon its own
resources and strategies to survive**]{.underline}. **[Security is a
perennial concern]{.underline}** [--- even for powerful states --- and
states tend to worry a lot about who is weaker or stronger and what
power trends appear to be]{.underline}. [Cooperation is far from
impossible]{.underline} in such a world --- indeed, [at times
cooperating with others is essential to survival]{.underline} --- [but
it is always **somewhat fragile**]{.underline}. Realists maintain that
[states will react to threats first by **trying to "pass the
buck"**]{.underline} (i.e., getting someone else to deal with the
emerging danger), [and if that fails, they will try to **balance**
against the threat, either by seeking allies or by building up their own
capabilities]{.underline}.

Realism isn't the only way to think about international affairs, of
course, and there are a number of alternative perspectives and theories
that can help us understand different aspects of the modern world. [But
if you do think like a realist --- at least part of the time --- many
confusing aspects of world politics become easier to
understand]{.underline}.

[If you think like a realist]{.underline}, for example, [you'll
understand why **China's rise** is a critical event and likely to be a
**source of conflict** with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates (and others). [In a world where states have to
protect themselves, the two most powerful states will eye each other
warily and compete to make sure that they don't fall behind or become
dangerously vulnerable to the other]{.underline}. Even when war is
avoided, intense security competition is likely to result.

And [by the way, thinking like a realist helps you understand why China
is **no longer committed** to Deng Xiaoping's policy of "peaceful
rise."]{.underline} [That approach made sense when China was weaker, and
it **fooled plenty** of Westerners into thinking China could be
inveigled into being a responsible stakeholder that would meekly embrace
various institutions and arrangements created by others back when China
was weak]{.underline}. But [realists understand that a more powerful
China would eventually want to modify any features that were not in
China's interest, as Beijing has begun to do in recent
years]{.underline}. Bottom line: **[Thinking like a realist is essential
if you want to understand Sino-American relations]{.underline}**.

If you think like a realist, you wouldn't be surprised that the United
States has repeatedly used military force in distant lands over the past
25 years and especially after 9/11. Why? For one simple reason: Nobody
could prevent it. Americans were also convinced their global role was
indispensable and that they had the right, the responsibility, and the
wisdom to interfere all over the world. But America's dominant position
was the permissive condition that made this overweening ambition seem
feasible, at least for a while. As Kenneth Waltz warned way back in
1993: "One may hope that America's internal preoccupations will produce
not an isolationist policy, which has become impossible, but a
forbearance that will give other countries at long last the chance to
deal with their own problems and make their own mistakes. But I would
not bet on it." Good realist that he was, Waltz understood that the
"vice to which great powers easily succumb in a multipolar world is
inattention; in a bipolar world, overreaction; in a unipolar world,
overextension." And that's precisely what happened.

[If you think like a realist, the crisis in **Ukraine**]{.underline}
[looks]{.underline} rather [different]{.underline} than the typical
Western version of events. [Western accounts typically
blame]{.underline} [Putin]{.underline} for most of the trouble, [but
realists understand that major powers are]{.underline} always [sensitive
about]{.underline} their [borders and are likely to **react
defensively**]{.underline} [if other great powers start encroaching on
these regions]{.underline}. Ever heard of the Monroe Doctrine? In the
case of Ukraine, the United States and its European allies had been
expanding NATO steadily eastward (violating pledges made to Soviet
leaders when Germany reunified) and ignoring repeated warnings from
Moscow. By 2013, the United States and European Union were making a
concerted effort to pull Ukraine into closer alignment with the West and
openly interfering in Ukraine's domestic political processes. Because
the Obama administration did not think like realists, however, it was
blindsided when Putin seized Crimea and derailed the EU/U.S. effort.
[Putin's response was neither legal nor legitimate nor admirable, but it
wasn't surprising either]{.underline}. It is equally unsurprising that
[these events alarmed the Europeans and prompted NATO to shore up its
defenses in Eastern Europe, precisely as a realist would
expect]{.underline}.

Thinking like a realist can also help you understand why the EU is in
trouble. The entire EU project was designed to transcend nationalism and
subordinate state interests within broader supranational institutions.
Its architects hoped the separate national identities and interests that
had torn Europe apart repeatedly would fade over time and a broad
pan-European identity would supplant them. European unity was
facilitated by the Cold War because the Soviet threat gave Western
Europe ample incentive to cooperate, gave the Soviets' Eastern European
satellites an ideal to aspire to, and kept the "American pacifier" on
the continent. But once the Cold War was over, nationalism returned with
a vengeance and especially after the euro crisis hit. Suddenly,
populations wanted their elected officials not to save Europe but to
save them. Despite herculean efforts by a number of European leaders and
EU officials, these centrifugal tendencies seem to be getting worse, as
the Brexit decision, the recent elections in Italy, and the resurgent
nationalism in Poland and Hungary all attest. Those who hoped that
European integration would prove irreversible have trouble understanding
how their noble experiment went awry, but realists don't.

If you think like a realist, you might not be quite so outraged by the
support that Iran and Syria gave the anti-American insurgency in Iraq
after 2003. You might not like it, but you wouldn't find their conduct
surprising. Their response was classic balance of power behavior because
the United States had just overthrown Saddam Hussein and the Bush
administration had made it clear that Syria and Iran were next on its
hit list. It made good strategic sense for Damascus and Tehran to do
whatever they could to keep the United States bogged down in Iraq so
that Washington couldn't reload the shotgun and come after them.
Americans have every reason to be upset by what these states did, but if
more U.S. officials thought like realists, they would have expected it
from the get-go.

And if you think like a realist, it is obvious why North Korea has gone
to enormous lengths to acquire a nuclear deterrent and obvious why a
country such as Iran was interested in becoming a latent nuclear weapons
state as well. These states were deeply at odds with the world's most
powerful country, and prominent U.S. officials kept saying that the only
solution was to topple these regimes and replace them with leaders more
to their liking. Never mind that regime change rarely works as intended;
the more important point is that any government facing a threat like
that is going to try to protect itself. Nuclear weapons aren't good for
blackmail or conquest, but they are a very effective way to deter more
powerful states from trying to overthrow you with military force. And
you'd think Americans would understand this, given that the U.S.
government thinks it needs thousands of nuclear weapons in order to be
secure, despite its favorable geographic position and overwhelming
conventional superiority. If U.S. leaders think like that, is it any
wonder that some weaker and more vulnerable powers conclude that having
a few nukes might make them more secure? And is it so surprising that
they might be reluctant to give them up in exchange for assurances or
promises that might easily be reversed or withdrawn? Someone really
should explain this logic to John Bolton.

Thinking like a realist also helps you understand why states with
radically different political systems often act in surprisingly similar
ways. To take an obvious example, the United States and Soviet Union
could not have been more different in terms of their domestic orders,
but their international behavior was much the same. Each led vast
alliance networks, toppled governments they didn't like, assassinated a
number of foreign leaders, built tens of thousand of nuclear weapons
(deployed on missiles, bombers, and submarines), intervened in far-flung
lands, tried to convert other societies to their preferred ideology, and
did what they could to bring the other down without blowing up the
world. Why did they behave in such similar fashion? Because [in an
anarchic world, each had **little choice but to compete** with the
other, lest it fall behind and become vulnerable to the other's
predations]{.underline}.

Last but not least, [if you think like a realist, you're likely to be
**skeptical** about the **ambitious schemes** that **idealists** keep
dreaming up to bring an end to conflict, injustice, inequality, and
other bad things]{.underline}. [Striving to build a safer and more
peaceful world is admirable, but realism reminds us that the **ambitious
efforts** to remake world politics **always create unintended
consequences** and **rarely deliver the promised results**]{.underline}.
It also reminds that even allies fear unchecked power and will have
misgivings whenever the United States tries to run the world. If you
think like a realist, in short, you are more likely to act with a degree
of prudence, and you'll be less likely to see opponents as purely evil
(or see one's own country as wholly virtuous) and less likely to embark
on open-ended moral crusades. Ironically, [if more people thought like
realists, the **prospects for peace would go up**]{.underline}.

**ST -- Securitization Theory**

Racism is a powerful, malignant force in world politics, and our
discipline, IR, has deeply problematic entanglements with it. It is a
serious matter both to come intellectually to grips with this and to
find the most effective strategies to act on it. [We worry
that]{.underline} [more serious **problems**]{.underline} [and
**possibilities** are **marginalised**]{.underline} [by an ultimately
very **inward-looking** and **scholastic exercise**]{.underline} [where
a particular definition of racism and]{.underline} a specific
[theoretical perspective makes it possible to deem the vast majority of
scholarship in IR 'racist', 'methodologically white' and 'antiblack'-
every work that does not explicitly follow one exact version of
anti-racist scholarship]{.underline}. Especially, [the role
played]{.underline} in H&RM's argumentation [by]{.underline} our **[sins
of omission]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} ultimately seem to [rest
on the premise that **only** their **distinct form**]{.underline} [of
scholarship can be redeemed]{.underline}, because even post-colonial
scholarship and critiques of euro-centrism are not enough; [you are a
racist if you do not follow exactly this particular route]{.underline}.
It is not important whether your scholarship actually supports or
hinders anti-racist analysis or political engagement; [it is all about
**who you cite**]{.underline} [and what **declarations you
make**]{.underline}. **[Here]{.underline}**, [a theory is not judged by
**what can be done with it**]{.underline}, [but by the question whether
**self-appointed anti-racists** can find **supposedly problematic
sentences** somewhere in its key texts]{.underline}. In this section, we
will first point out that the H&RM article is a personal attack on us
for racism, despite their reassurances about the opposite. Then, we
discuss what an analysis of structural racism (systems of power) could
amount to, given that they claim to do one but utterly fail to do so,
resorting instead to a pretend examination of the foundations of ST.
Next, we discuss what could be methodological guidelines for actually
proving whether or not a theory like ST is racist.

[H&RM's usage of the term racism for all scholarship that does not
foreground race as the primary theme, means that **99% of IR will be
'racist'**]{.underline}. [There will be **no room** for any other
scholarship]{.underline} (unless you will live with the moniker of being
racist). [Not only does this seem **very unproductive**]{.underline} [in
terms of disciplinary conversations, not to talk of **diversity** and
**pluralism**, it]{.underline} also [means that it becomes **very hard**
to use the category of 'racism' for **critical purposes**]{.underline}
[for those cases where it **actually is at stake**]{.underline} in a
sense closer to what the rest of the discipline, and indeed the public
discourse, means by it. [It has been **watered down**]{.underline} [by
the fact that everyone but those in critical whiteness studies have been
deemed racist]{.underline}, one by one, where we just happened to get
the special honour of being among the first. [H&RM might protest that
this is not their plan, but we **fail to see how this can be
avoided**]{.underline} [when the logic they apply is that the term
racist can be based primarily on **sins of omission**]{.underline} [in
the sense of a theory being focused around other
categories]{.underline}.

As documented above, they claim numerous times that ST 'occludes' or
'refuses' various dynamics relating to race that they find important,
but they never offer any basis for concluding that the theory makes it
harder to see these things, only that it does not as such zoom in on
them. This does not have to do with a choice particularly regarding race
but the structure and nature of the theory as a general analytical
apparatus that can be applied to all instances where actors try to
securitize or desecuritize something, and the user is free then to
include race more or less in this analysis, just as the theory is not
deciding how important nationalism is or gender51, but it enables the
analysis of the way different categories and distinctions become
politically mobilised in security struggles.

[H&RM will probably argue that if you do not mention race in these
contexts, you '**hide' it**]{.underline}. **[Three
answers]{.underline}**: [1) **no**, there is a difference between **not
mentioning** and hiding, it takes a step more of the critic to show that
the theory **prevents** something from being articulated]{.underline} or
that it uses abstractions that stand in the way of articulating race;
that certainly is the case for some theories, so it is a legitimate
avenue of critique, but they haven't shown this, [2) the theory is
**intentionally**]{.underline} (as we have explained numerous times)
**[minimalist]{.underline}** in having a clear conceptual core and then
[not putting all kinds of factors like the role of media or populism
into the theory -- **not** because we haven't noticed these factors but
because they **belong in applications**, and the theory exactly allows
you to study these phenomena, 3) we are]{.underline} very [explicit that
one of the **advantages of a minimalist theory**]{.underline} [is the
ability to **combine it** with other theories]{.underline} especially
general theories [about the nature and structures of
society]{.underline}; one should not build out ST to become a general
theory of society or international relations, better in any specific
usage of the theory combine it with the theories one finds productive
for the particular research project. (Wæver 2011, 2015) The latter point
has come up in replies to the 'sociological' version of ST (Balzacq),
which has more of a tendency to add all relevant factors to the theory,
while the classical Copenhagen version is tight and invites combination
with theories that complement it, which could exactly be theories of
race and racism. Our ultimate concern here is: how do we actually get to
study racism in world politics in a practically and politically helpful
way?

When developing our own framework, ST, [we took **care**]{.underline}
[to make sure it could do critical work in concrete analyses, in our
view on racism as well]{.underline}, and H&RM fail to show that this is
not the case. In addition, we have then on a more mundane, human level
engaged ourselves in various ways to foster non-Western scholarship and
theories in IR (Tickner & Wæver 2009; Acharya & Buzan 2010, 2019). One
has for instance co-founded a book-series with the aim to identify
"alternatives for thinking about the 'international' that are more in
tune with local concerns and traditions outside the West" and
"provincializing the West" (quoting from the Routledge homepage of the
book series); the other has amongst many other things re-written this
history of the IR discipline to show both that it has ignored
non-Western contributions and that the Western part of it is indebted to
'scientific racism' (Buzan & Lawson 2015; Acharya and Buzan 2019).
Closer to ST, the project in Buzan & Wæver 2003 was to a large extent to
challenge the euro-centrism enshrined in dominant conceptions of
polarity and of the relationship between global and regional, to enable
theories to be more attentive to actual security dynamics in 'most of
the world'.

Surely, all of these efforts can be critically assessed as to what has
been helpful and what hasn't. But we find it strange that H&RM choose to
ignore completely the possibility of assessing the ability of ST to form
the basis for helpful analyses of racism. They neither look at those
analyses that have actually been done, nor do they show systematically
why it would be impossible to do so. On the contrary, [they limit
themselves to highly abstract and indirect attributions of racism to the
theory as such through various unconvincing routes]{.underline}. From
this they deduce (without any discussion) that ST can't inform studies
of racism (and when it has actually done it, they presumably are able to
magically make those publications go away) (see section 6 below).

[H&RM offer **no explanation**]{.underline} [as to how their type of
analysis helps in combating racism]{.underline}. [It is
**unclear**]{.underline} [if it is a kind of **ground clearing
operation**]{.underline} [to be followed up by new and better theories
after getting us out of the way]{.underline}. [Or whether they believe
that we are so much a part of the oppressive structures that attacking
us is in itself liberating]{.underline}. Or -- as we will consider below
in more detail -- the whole exercise is more about making universities
more inclusive and hospitable to students and scholars of colour.
Closely linked to the latter option, [their rationale could be that the
attack is meant more as a kind of 'happening' drawing attention to the
question of race]{.underline}. [Especially in the latter case, it would
be intentional that the article plays ambiguously with making a very
personal attack while pretending not to]{.underline}.
