2\. [**Rejoin** the **Arctic Council**, or ensure **continued support**
for its most **pressing initiatives**]{.underline}. [The Arctic Council
has proven to be the foremost player in international climate policy in
the region, and it was **specifically designed** to function in spite of
the **security** **differences** of its member states]{.underline}. The
United States and its allies have far more to lose by boycotting the
organization than they stand to gain. **[Washington]{.underline}**
[should resume participation]{.underline} [in the **Arctic Council** as
**soon** as **possible**]{.underline}; if this is infeasible during
Russia's chairmanship of the council, the United States should continue
its support for the organization's six expert working groups, or seek to
duplicate their activities with regional partners or through other
forums. Norway will take over as chair of the council in 2023.

[The Arctic Council was]{.underline} responsible for several activities
of key import to US Arctic interests. First, the organization was [a
**principal organizer** of **scientific collaboration** that
included]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**, [most of which has
**ground to a halt.**]{.underline} [Second, the Arctic Council created a
working group to study radiological sites in the Arctic, create
procedures to recover hazardous materials, and **craft contingency
plans** in case of **nuclear** **contamination**]{.underline}. The
council was set to convene this summer to discuss nuclear waste
disposal, but the meeting has been canceled. [Third,]{.underline} [the
**organization** was largely **responsible** for **monitoring
environmental**]{.underline} [**conditions** and **pollution** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and experts fear that without adequate oversight,
Russia will be free to conduct harmful activities such as gas-flaring.

Analysts have proposed that the Arctic Council member states other than
Russia duplicate the most important organizational projects among
themselves, without Russian involvement. In fact, the United States has
successfully engaged allies to pursue environmental goals outside of the
forum in the past. Moreover, other organizations, such as the
International Arctic Science Committee, have continued their operations
without Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and could provide an
alternative for regional engagement.

However, although this approach would yield more progress than
suspending Arctic cooperation entirely, Russian involvement in Arctic
climate collaboration is critical. The nation owns more than half of the
Arctic coastline, contains the vast majority of the area's radiological
contamination, and samples and data from Russia are indispensable for
climate change research. Therefore, the United States should seek to
resume its participation in the Arctic Council in 2023 at the latest;
Washington should also address the environmental concerns that are
normally managed by the council's working groups with other Arctic
states until that point. US policymakers could also work through the
Northern Forum, a Russia-based international organization that
coordinates efforts among subnational Arctic governments; however, there
is no full substitute for national-level collaboration on larger
environmental priorities.

[In the **future**, the United States cannot **allow** its
**relationship** with the **Arctic Council** to become a **victim** of
**security competition**]{.underline}. [One of the principal strengths
of the Arctic Council is its **explicit commitment** to avoid **security
issues**]{.underline}. Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo upended this
norm by raising security concerns in the forum in 2019, and the United
States and its Western partners boycotted the organization in response
to another security situation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [If the
**United** States continues to link its **security concerns** with its
**Arctic Council activities**, the **organization's ability** to
**safeguard** the Arctic **environment** could be **critically
eroded.**]{.underline}

#### The net benefit is [Russia]{.underline}. Absent utilizing a multilateral forum, there will be inevitable escalation of conflicts. Doing both fails.

Conclusion

With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military supremacy
driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed geopolitical
region. [Global powers like **China**, the **U.S.,** and **Russia** are
**vying** for **control of the region** because of the melting
ice]{.underline}, [which has made it more **accessible** for **economic
exploitation**. Territorial claims overlap when states **bolster** their
**military presence**, raising the possibility of **error or
conflict**]{.underline}. [The Arctic runs the risk of **turning** into a
**hot spot** for **future hostilities** in the **absence** of **defined
methods** to handle these tensions.]{.underline}

[There is an urgent need for more **international collaboration** to
stop this **escalation**. Although the UNCLOS]{.underline} [and the
**Arctic Council** have **facilitated communication**]{.underline}, they
are ill-equipped to handle the region's growing security concerns.
[Redoubled efforts should]{.underline} concentrate on broadening
diplomatic channels to cover security and military matters, [setting up
a platform for Arctic countries to discuss weapons control and
**developing guidelines** for **military behavior**]{.underline}. [The
moment has come for Arctic]{.underline} [countries to engage in
**formalized diplomatic discussion** that covers military and security
matters]{.underline}. [Whether through]{.underline} a distinct treaty or
[the Arctic Council, a new global]{.underline} security framework [might
offer a forum for **controlling** the **military buildup**]{.underline},
negotiating arms control measures, [and defining explicit rules of
engagement to avoid unintentional conflicts.]{.underline} In addition to
lowering the likelihood of violence, this would establish a crisis
management system in the Arctic. [International organizations must also
**mediate conflicts** and make sure that]{.underline} [**competition**
i]{.underline}n the Arctic [doesn't]{.underline}
[jeopardize]{.underline} [indigenous rights or the **sustainability** of
the **environment**.]{.underline} In [the face of mounting global
pressure, the **Arctic** can only continue to be a **region of
harmony**, **collaboration**, and **shared wealth** via **concerted
effort**.]{.underline}

[The presidential aide]{.underline} also [highlighted that \"the US and

Council]{.underline}\" (from the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine
in 2022) but added that [Moscow is prepared for **further interaction

\"[We are ready to resume dialogue and **constructive
cooperation**]{.underline} [with the **Arctic states**]{.underline} for
[the **peaceful development** of the Arctic, with respect for our

meetings at a diplomatic and political level remain paused.

### AC CP\-\--Solvency\-\--Missile Defense

#### The CP solves missile defense\-\--they key to missile defense is clearing ice paths in the arctic which the AC can do with [Chinese]{.underline} icebreakers instead of US icebreakers.

cleared with Chinese icebreakers\". Brookings. 11/24/21.

HDCSW-Packet

[The United States has smartly committed to the construction of a new
class of icebreakers]{.underline}, the Polar Security Cutter (PSC), but
delays in construction and design issues will likely set back the first
vessel becoming operational for many more years. **[In the
meantime]{.underline}**, [the United States lacks a **viable bridging
strategy**]{.underline} [to ensure that it is positioned to operate in
an Arctic that is seeing increased human activity --- and with it,
potential for conflict and natural disaster.]{.underline}

While the United States and its allies rightly criticize Beijing's
outlandish claims to being a "near-Arctic power," and fought its
position as an observer within the Arctic Council for many years, this
is becoming less of a defensible criticism of China. [With its annual
deployment of icebreakers and other research vessels to the Arctic each
year and its increased scientific and economic investments in the
region]{.underline}, **[China is in a position to have more presence in
the Arctic than the United States will for some time.]{.underline}**
[They may very well become]{.underline} (or perhaps have become) **[the
Arctic partner of choice]{.underline}** [in this increasingly important
region.]{.underline}

Many point to the United States' strong alliances in the Arctic and say
that our strength is in our cooperation with Arctic like-minded
partners, four of which are NATO members. [But our Arctic allies are
also not immune to Chinese interest in the region and many seem to
**welcome China's increased role** as an **investor and cooperative
scientific partner in the Arctic**.]{.underline}

HDCSW-Packet

[For nearly **three decades**]{.underline}, [the **Arctic Council** has
been a successful example of]{.underline} post-Cold War
**[cooperation]{.underline}**.

[Its eight members]{.underline}, [including **Russia** and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [have cooperated on
**climate-change** research and **social development**]{.underline}
across the ecologically sensitive region.

Now, a year after council members stopped working with Russia following
its invasion of Ukraine and as Norway prepares to assume the
chairmanship from Moscow on May 11, [experts are asking whether the
polar body\'s **viability is at risk** if it cannot
cooperate]{.underline} with the country that controls over half of the
Arctic coastline.

[An ineffective Arctic Council could have dire implications for
the]{.underline} region\'s **[environment]{.underline}** and its 4
million inhabitants [who face the effects of **melting sea ice**
and]{.underline} the interest of non-Arctic countries in the region\'s
mostly [untapped mineral **resources**]{.underline}.

[The work of the **council**]{.underline}, which comprises the eight
Arctic states of Finland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Russia, Denmark,
Canada and the United States, in the past [has produced **binding
agreements** on **environmental protection** and
preservation]{.underline}.

It is also a rare platform giving a voice to the region\'s Indigenous
peoples. It does not deal with security issues.

[But with the **end of cooperation** with Moscow]{.underline}, about a
third of [the council\'s]{.underline} 130 [projects are **on
hold**]{.underline}, [new projects **cannot go ahead** and existing ones
**cannot be renewed**]{.underline}. Western and Russian [scientists no
longer share **climate change** findings]{.underline}, for example, and
[cooperation for possible **search-and-rescue** missions or **oil
spills** has stopped]{.underline}.

\"I am worried that this will really hobble the ability of the Arctic
Council to work through these various issues,\" U.S. senator Angus King
from Maine told Reuters.

A DIVIDED REGION?

The Arctic is warming about four times as fast as the rest of the world.

As sea ice vanishes, polar waters are opening to shipping and other
industries eager to exploit the region\'s bounty of natural resources,
including oil, gas, and metals such as gold, iron and rare earths.

The discord between Russia and the other Arctic Council members means
that an effective response to these changes is far less likely.

\"Norway has a big challenge,\" said John Holdren, co-director of the
Harvard Kennedy School\'s Arctic Initiative and a former science advisor
to U.S. President Barack Obama. \"That\'s how to rescue as much as
possible of the Arctic Council\'s good work in the absence of Russia.\"

Russia argues this work cannot continue without it.

The council is weakening, Russian Arctic Ambassador Nikolay Korchunov
told Reuters, saying he was not confident it \"will be able to remain
the main platform on Arctic issues\".

Adding to the worries is the possibility that Russia will go its own way
on issues affecting the region or even establish a rival council.

Recently, it has taken steps to expand cooperation in the Arctic with
non-Arctic states. On April 24, Russia and China signed a memorandum
establishing cooperation between the countries\' coast guards in the
Arctic.

Days earlier, on April 14, Russia invited China, India, Brazil and South
Africa - the BRICS - to conduct research at its settlement on Svalbard,
an Arctic archipelago under Norwegian sovereignty where other countries
can operate under a 1920 Treaty.

\"Russia is seeking to build relationships with some non-Arctic
countries, particularly China, and that is a development that is
concerning,\" said David Balton, executive director of the Arctic
Steering Committee at the White House.

Russia\'s Korchunov said Moscow welcomed non-Arctic states in the
region, provided they did not come with a military agenda.

\"Our focus on a purely peaceful format of partnership also reflects the
need of development of scientific and economic cooperation with
non-Arctic countries,\" he said.

HOW TO ENGAGE WITH MOSCOW

Norway says it is \"optimistic\" a seamless transition of the
chairmanship from Russia can be achieved as it is in the interest of all
Arctic states to maintain the Arctic Council.

\"[We need to safeguard the **Arctic Council**]{.underline} as the most
important international forum for Arctic cooperation [and make sure it
survives]{.underline},\" Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Eivind Vad
Petersson told Reuters.

That will not be easy, given Oslo\'s own strained relations with Moscow.
In April, Oslo expelled 15 Russian diplomats saying they were spies.
Moscow denied the accusations and Korchunov said the expulsions
undermined the trust needed for cooperation.

Analysts say NATO-member Norway, which shares an Arctic border with
Russia, is still well-placed to handle the delicate balancing act with
Moscow.

\"Norway has been the most outspoken when it comes to the possibility of
keeping the door ajar so that Russia could, when politically feasible,
be part of the Arctic Council again,\" said Svein Vigeland Rottem, a
senior researcher in Arctic governance and security at the Fridtjof
Nansen Institute in Oslo.

Indeed, said lawmaker Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, [the **council** will
eventually need to **reengage** with Russia]{.underline} even if that
moment has not yet arrived.

\"I don\'t see an Arctic Council without Russia in the future,\" said
Larsen, a Greenland lawmaker at the Danish Parliament and the Chair of
Arctic Parliamentarians, a body including MPs from across the Arctic
countries.

\"We need to be prepared for a different time when the war (in Ukraine)
one day will be over.\"

Militarization -- the big elephant in the room

[The strong militarization in the Arctic is the elephant in the room in
the Arctic Council]{.underline} as well as in the Norwegian and Nordic
public. [In order for the Arctic Council to be able to meet the
**existential** **environmental challenges**]{.underline}, [politicians
must **contribute** to ensure that the **geopolitical conflict lines**
**give way** to **practical cooperation**.]{.underline}

The geopolitical situation in the Arctic has worsened dramatically by
the Swedish and Finnish entry into NATO and the significant expansion of
the number of US bases in the Nordic countries. And not far from the
Norwegian border, Russia has its large military base on the Kola
Peninsula with nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons.

With much of the world's attention focused on US President Donald
Trump's historic visit to the Middle East or the fluctuating progress of
talks between Russia and Ukraine, a quiet but consequential event took
place last week that largely escaped notice.

In Norway, relatively low-level officials gathered for a closed-door
ceremony to mark the transfer of the Arctic Council's two-year rotating
chairmanship from Norway to Denmark. This may seem mundane. In fact it
was an important moment for one of the world's few remaining forums
where East and West, until recently, found ways to cooperate.

**[The council]{.underline}**, established in 1996, [brings together the
**eight Arctic states**]{.underline} --- Canada, Denmark (through
Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the US --- [to
collaborate on **non-military issues**]{.underline}. [For years, it
**functioned effectively** by focusing on **practical**, **low-conflict
areas** such as **environmental protection**, search and rescue
coordination, and oil spill response.]{.underline}

This pragmatic approach allowed the council to thrive, even during
periods of broader geopolitical tension. Crucially, it also includes six
indigenous organizations as permanent participants, giving the peoples
who live in the Arctic a direct voice in shaping its future. Observer
states, including faraway Singapore and major players such as China,
contribute expertise and funding, but have no vote.

[This system worked --- **until it didn't**.]{.underline}

[The invasion of Ukraine by Russia]{.underline} in February 2022
[**shattered** many channels of **cooperation** between Moscow and the
West, **including the Arctic Council**]{.underline}. Although Russia
handed over the chairmanship to Norway in May of that year, the
customary fanfare was noticeably absent. Over the past two years Norway
has tried to keep the council afloat, but the breakdown in relations
with Russia rendered it largely ineffective. By the time Norway passed
the chairmanship to Denmark, the best that could be said was that the
council still existed.

[Complicating matters further are suggestions by Trump that the US might
seek to **annex** **Greenland** and an unwillingness to **rule out
military force** to do so,]{.underline} [which have **alarmed NATO
allies** and **unsettled** the **Arctic Council's delicate
balance**.]{.underline} That may explain why it was Greenland's foreign
minister, rather than a Danish official, who accepted the chairmanship
on Denmark's behalf. How [this tension between the US and
Denmark]{.underline} plays out within the council remains to be seen,
but it [will not make **cooperation** any **easier**.]{.underline}

[With the council unable to conduct substantial work, its immediate goal
is simply to survive]{.underline}. Should a ceasefire or peace agreement
be reached in Ukraine, [some might push to **quickly** **revive the
council**, but they would **face serious headwinds**]{.underline}. Since
2022, [the **Arctic security** landscape has **changed
profoundly**]{.underline}. Norway's newly released national security
strategy describes its situation as "the most serious \... our country
has faced since the Second World War."

What happens in the Arctic is often shaped by geopolitical currents
elsewhere, and increasingly what happens in the Arctic has consequences
across the globe.

[Finland and Sweden]{.underline}, [previously militarily non-aligned,
have **joined NATO**, placing]{.underline} [**seven of the eight Arctic
states** under the same **security umbrella**]{.underline}. Their
accession to the alliance would have been unimaginable before Russia's
invasion. [The new Canadian government is **expanding** its **presence
in the Arctic**]{.underline}, [for geopolitical reasons that are
unlikely to **disappear anytime soon**]{.underline}: [Russia's actions
in Ukraine **have left deep scars**.]{.underline}

This evolving environment also affects non-Arctic states seeking a
larger role in the region. China, for example, has been one of the major
losers of the Arctic Council's dysfunction. Beijing used the forum to
expand influence in polar affairs. With the council no longer
functioning as it once did, China has lost a key international venue. In
response, Russia and China have deepened their cooperation in the
Arctic, particularly on energy and infrastructure projects, driven
partly by Western sanctions.

If the Arctic Council does eventually resume full operations, expect
China to re-engage quickly to regain lost ground.

[Another unresolved challenge concerns indigenous
representation]{.underline}. Among the six permanent indigenous
participants is the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the
North. However, many indigenous Russians have fled the country and
formed exile organizations, such as the International Committee of
Indigenous Peoples of Russia. These groups seek a seat at the Arctic
Council table, but so far no effort has been made to include them.
Moscow would undoubtedly veto any attempt to do so. If the council hopes
to rebuild credibility, it cannot return to business as usual while
excluding exiled indigenous voices. Navigating this will be tricky, but
necessary.

[Has the damage to **trust between Russia** and its **Arctic neighbors
gone too far** for the **council to recover?** It's too early to say,
but it **cannot be ruled out**.]{.underline}

Scorched Earth Policy

Ultimately, this means that [the Arctic Council now faces **two terrible
scenarios**]{.underline}. [The first is that in his scorched earth
policy **toward multilateralism**]{.underline}, [Trump will either move
to end the Arctic Council or at least **remove** the **U.S. as a
member**]{.underline}. [He may also carry out his threat to
ensure]{.underline} [that both Canada and Denmark also cease to be
**meaningful members** of the **Arctic Council**]{.underline}. If he
truly does intend to take over Canada, it won't even be a state. Even if
he only means to weaken and reduce [Canada]{.underline} to a vassal
state, its [ability to participate will be **damaged**]{.underline} --
**[if not eliminated.]{.underline}**

Likewise, if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated. [Assuming that
somehow the Arctic Council **survives** an **American
withdrawal**]{.underline}, [and the U.S. follows up its threats to
control **Greenland** and **Canada**]{.underline}, [the Council would
have only the active membership of Finland, Sweden, Norway and
Iceland.]{.underline}

**[Even if]{.underline}** [the U.S. **remains** in the **Arctic
Council**, its current actions means the gutting of some of its most
important missions]{.underline}, [The U.S. won't support actions to
eliminate the **causes** of **climate change**]{.underline}, and it is
very unlikely to support the Permanent Participants. Outside of the
Council, perhaps the Coast Guard forum will continue. But even here
Trump is having an impact. He has already fired Admiral Linda Pagan, the
Commandant of the USCG. American officials have suggested it was because
of her commitment to DEI policies.

[Even more dangerously, this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [It would also include a Denmark
that has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to **take
action** to **prevent this**]{.underline}. [It will include a Canada
that is being continually weakened by American action]{.underline}, and
is either actively trying to stop an American takeover or has become a
vassal state to the U.S. [It will also include a Russia that is being
**increasingly supported** by **the U.S.**]{.underline} and has been
given the right of conquest over Ukraine. Furthermore, [if Ukraine
was]{.underline} conquered for considering joining NATO, [the future of
both **Finland** and **Sweden**]{.underline} (which did actually join
NATO) [will undoubtedly be **even more problematic** for
**Russia**.]{.underline}

[These are **dire times** for the **Arctic Council**]{.underline}. It is
hard to think of a way to maintain its many successes in supporting an
understanding of the impact of climate change on the Arctic. It has also
played an important role in supporting a greater awareness of the
northern Indigenous Peoples in the region. [And perhaps most
importantly, it has served as the principal means of promoting a
peaceful and harmonious international regime of
cooperation.]{.underline}

All of this is now at risk. Perhaps **[Trump]{.underline}** [won't think
that the Arctic Council is worth his attention, and it can **somehow
remain** under the **American radar** until the next **presidential
election**]{.underline}. But as many have said in the past, **[hope is
not a strategy]{.underline}**.

### 1AR\-\--Solvency Deficit\-\--Shipbuilding

#### Increasing icebreakers is key to shipbuilding\-\--the CP can't solve

"[The US has a **very small fleet** of icebreakers]{.underline}, one
heavy and two medium, and [they're old and really spend a lot of time in
maintenance,"]{.underline} says Cynthia Cook, director of the
Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS). "We have relatively few --- fewer than we
need."

Donald Trump agrees. The US president plans to order 48 icebreakers to
help dramatically expand the US presence in the increasingly contested
polar regions. Russia already has world-leading icebreaker capabilities,
while China is taking a growing interest in the Arctic and its mineral
riches.

But [no American shipyard has built a heavy icebreaker in
decades]{.underline}. A programme to construct three such vessels, known
as Polar Security Cutters, was approved in Mr Trump's first term, but is
years behind schedule and significantly over budget.

This reflects a much wider malaise in American shipbuilding. The US
built 5% of the world's ocean-going commercial ships in the 1970s.
Today, the figure is 0.1%. The protectionist Jones Act of 1920, which
requires vessels sailing between US ports to be built domestically, has
done little to help US shipbuilding remain globally significant.

Challenging China

[China,]{.underline} meanwhile[, has built an **astonishing lead** in
the race for **shipbuilding dominance**]{.underline}. [Chinese
shipyards, buoyed by heavy subsidies, now turn out more than half of the
world's merchant vessels]{.underline}. According to the CSIS, the
state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation alone produced twice
the shipping tonnage in 2024 than the United States has built in total
since the second world war.

**[The situation is giving American strategists sleepless
nights]{.underline}**. "[If you look back through history, there's never
really been a leading power that did not have maritime
strength,"]{.underline} warns Mark Kennedy, director of the Wahba
Institute for Strategic Competition at the Wilson Center think tank.
**[American shipbuilding weakness is a matter of "grave concern", he
says.]{.underline}**

Carrot and stick efforts to revive US shipbuilding are beginning to take
shape. The Trump administration is threatening to impose levies on
shipping companies that have ordered vessels from China. At the same
time, Congress is considering legislation that would offer powerful
incentives for companies to invest in US shipbuilding.

But [as they approach the massive task of rebuilding America's maritime
strength, policymakers face uncomfortable choices. Do they prioritise
ships, or shipbuilding?]{.underline} The fastest way to acquire new
vessels is to order from allied countries such as South Korea and Japan,
which boast the strongest shipbuilding industries outside China.
[Investing in domestic shipbuilding,]{.underline} by contrast, [**would
create far more jobs** and help **restore the country's industrial
base**]{.underline}, but would take much longer to accomplish.

**[How the administration resolves this dilemma will have drastic
implications for global trade and geopolitics.]{.underline}**

Danish Relations with the US

In recent months, the Danish Presidency of the Arctic Council has been
challenged by the new US position on the Arctic, Greenland and Europe.
President Donald **[Trump's]{.underline}** [continued provocative
statements regarding the potential transfer of Greenland to US control
have **heightened political tensions**]{.underline}. However, neither
the Kingdom of Denmark as a whole nor Greenland itself has supported
these assertions. In April 2025, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen
made an official visit to Nuuk, where she, together with Greenland's
acting head of government Múte Bourup Egede and newly elected head of
government Jens-Frederik Nielsen issued a statement rejecting any
external claims. This joint statement demonstrates unity within the
Danish Realm in the face of external pressure.

[The United States views Greenland as a **strategically important**
**territory** for its **missile defense** and **Arctic surveillance
system**]{.underline}, [especially in the context of the development of
the **Pituffik base**]{.underline}. [This is related to the **US
strategic pressure** on the **Kingdom**]{.underline}. Denmark's response
has been to strengthen its position in the Arctic while avoiding direct
confrontation with the United States, supporting Greenland's right to
self-determination, and strengthening its defense to protect its
interests in the region. However, [**growing pressure** from the **US**
is undermining the **Kingdom's diplomatic** **control** over the
**Arctic agenda** and is **contributing** to the **decline** of the
Arctic Council's influence as a **platform for regional
cooperation**.]{.underline}

#### NATO-Russia tensions over Ukraine make Arctic Council cooperation impossible.

[**Despite growing tension** between **Russia** and the **West**
**throughout the 2000s**]{.underline}, [not even NATO
enlargement]{.underline} into the Baltics and Balkans in 2004 and 2009,
the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, its military intervention in
Syria, [and]{.underline} the annexation of Ukraine's
[Crimea]{.underline} peninsula in 2014 [could shake the relative
stability of Arctic relations.]{.underline}12) While Europe was in
crisis following Russia's incursion into Ukrainian territory, the
members of the Arctic Council maintained good relations and cooperation
continued in various regional organizations throughout the north. Some
joint military exercises between NATO states and Russia were cancelled,
but the tradition of Arctic exceptionalism continued mostly unaffected
under the well-known adage of "High North, low tension."13)

[The **watershed moment** came in February 2022, when **Russia launched
a full-scale** **invasion against Ukraine**]{.underline}. [In the months
that followed, the Arctic Council members issued a statement that they
**would** **pause work** with **Russia**,]{.underline}14) [and Sweden
and Finland **negated decades** of **neutrality** policy when they
petitioned to **become NATO members**]{.underline}.15) Finland was
admitted to the Alliance in April 2023, followed by Sweden in March
2024, making seven out of eight Arctic states NATO members.

[**Russia's latest** unprovoked **violence** in **Ukraine** has
irreparably changed the **security landscape** of both **Europe** and
the **Arctic**]{.underline}.16) [The breakdown of relations has **been
far-reaching**]{.underline}, [affecting]{.underline} everything from
major intergovernmental bodies such as [the Arctic Council]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} regional partnerships such as [the Barents Euro-Arctic
Council]{.underline} (BEAC), which Russia dropped out of in September
2023 [after stating that **Western hostility** was to **blame** for the
**lack of cooperation**]{.underline}.17) [Arctic Indigenous groups have
reported difficulties in carrying out ongoing initiatives to strengthen
Indigenous rights]{.underline} and monitor environmental problems in the
north [after the fracture of relations between **Russia** and the
**West**]{.underline}.18) Yet [Russia remains a formidable force in the
north,]{.underline} with jurisdiction over 53 percent of the Arctic
coastline. Contrary to what some journalists have argued, Russia has not
"lost the Arctic to NATO,"19) considering that the Russian Arctic is the
most populated and industrialized northern region in the world, and that
it has a substantial head start on Arctic military build-up and
navigation compared to most other Arctic states.20) Russia also
significantly outnumbers NATO in terms of military bases in the Arctic.

#### Structural issues prevent effective Council action.

Although [the **Arctic Council**]{.underline} has a good foundation, it
[is **constrained** in **significant ways**. The first]{.underline} of
these [is **funding**]{.underline}. While the Arctic Council Secretariat
seems adequately funded (1.24 million USD in 2017, with Norway
contributing half), [it has **very little discretionary
funding**]{.underline}. Similarly, [the **Working Groups**]{.underline}
rely on one or two states to fund a secretariat but [have
**limited**]{.underline} ongoing [project funds]{.underline}. Almost all
activities are funded on an ad hoc basis by the states who advocated for
them and by individual experts who secure their own funding through
national channels. Thus, all too often it is [funding]{.underline} that
[drives projects, **not** projects]{.underline} that [drive funding.
This makes it **difficult**]{.underline} to be strategic with planning,
or [to organize **new activities** beyond a **one or two year
window**]{.underline}. Moreover, funding to support the capacity and
participation of Permanent Participants is a constant source of concern.
The establishment of the widely publicized Álgu Fund, conceptualized as
a "capacity-building endowment" has not been successful in addressing
this challenge as of yet.

While [the Arctic Council]{.underline} has made good progress on
becoming more transparent in recent years through its open access
archive, it still [**struggles** to be **accountable** to
stakeholders]{.underline}, northerners, and taxpayers. [This is **not**
for lack of **effort**, but **due to its structure**. It has a
**voluntary character**, which prevents **binding
commitments**]{.underline}. Ministerial Declarations contain many
subjective statements that are difficult to account for, and no formal
efforts are made to assess them. A tracking tool, the Amarok, has been
established to document life cycle phases of various projects and
initiatives, but there are no resources to systematically measure
progress on outcomes, value for money/effort, or implementation, or to
provide ongoing monitoring.
