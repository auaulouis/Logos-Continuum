[The Arctic plays a **significant role** in Russia's self-identity as a
**great power** because Russia has historically perceived the Arctic to
largely belong in its **sphere of influence** and because Russia boasts
**regional hegemony** in the area]{.underline}. [Russia's security
posture aims to maintain Russia's sphere of influence to safeguard it
against external threats, particularly in areas of strategic importance
such as the Arctic.]{.underline} While the [U.S.]{.underline} is by far
the most powerful Arctic state, its **[limited presence]{.underline}**
[in the Arctic has granted Russia de-facto hegemony in the
region.]{.underline} In terms of the greatest capabilities deployed in
the region and the fact that [Russia has the **largest Arctic
fleet**]{.underline} [capable of year-round power]{.underline}
[projection]{.underline}, [Russia is the **commanding military
power**]{.underline}. However, [Russia has **increasingly perceived**
the U.S. and NATO as trying to **reduce and replace its influence** in
its **historic sphere of influence.**]{.underline}

Over the last few decades, Russia has sought to increase its military
presence and capabilities in the Arctic to demonstrate and maintain
Russia's power in the region as well as convey it to the U.S. and NATO.
Russia has both re-opened former Soviet military and radar bases on and
around its northern coastline and has built new ones to boast a total of
twenty-seven bases above the Arctic Circle. Additionally, [Russia
intends to add an additional twenty-two icebreakers to its existing
fleet of fifty-five which will significantly increase its already strong
year-round power projection capabilities in the Arctic. Meanwhile, the
U.S. and NATO have responded to Russia's "aggressive" behavior in the
Arctic by building up their own military presences and military
capabilities in the region.]{.underline} [The U.S intends to build six
new icebreakers for the Coast Guard to replace the two in its fleet to
better maintain a persistent presence in the region year-round and has
reopened the Keflavik Naval Air Station in Iceland where it now stations
a bomber task force mission for "strategic deterrence."]{.underline}
NATO has taken similar actions in response to Russia's expanding
military presence by taking steps such as increasing its exercise and
training tempo in the region to "show the world that NATO is relevant,
united, and ready to defend itself".

One implication of Russia's actions in the Arctic involves the
continuation of suspicion and mistrust between Russia and the U.S./NATO
in the future, especially considering Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
[The U.S. and NATO may]{.underline} reasonably [continue to view
Russia's actions in the Arctic with **heightened
suspicion**]{.underline} [and increase their own respective **military
presences** and **capabilities in the Arctic**]{.underline} [to bolster
their own self-defense capacities]{.underline}. The current perspectives
of [each side viewing the other as presenting a potential security
threat leads to **continuing cycles of mutual distrust** and
**uncertainty** between Russia and the U.S./NATO in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [**Geopolitical tensions** and
**suspicions**]{.underline} [will **continue to increase** as this cycle
continues]{.underline}, [which may result in a **destabilizing** and
**increasingly offensive posture in the region**]{.underline}. U.S.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has cited "the importance of
maintaining lines of communication \[with Russia\] amid the ongoing war"
in Ukraine. [Maintaining **open diplomatic**]{.underline} and military
[lines of communication between the U.S. and Moscow on Arctic matters
may be one way to help **minimize misperceptions** by either country in
the Arctic to help reduce tensions or avoid misperceptions that could
lead to **accidental escalation**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the outcome of Russia's war in Ukraine bears the potential
to influence future security and stability in the Arctic regarding
Russia's future on the Arctic Council. Composed of the eight Arctic
states (the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Russia, Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden), the Council is a consensus-based intergovernmental forum
designed to facilitate cooperation and collaboration on Arctic concerns
and which thereby contributes to stability in the region. As a response
to the onset of Russia's invasion to Ukraine, the seven other members of
the Council (the "Arctic 7") suspended political activities and
high-level meetings. While projects that did not involve Russia resumed
as early as the summer of 2022, this decision has pushed back the
progress of inter-Arctic dialogue and cooperation. [Regardless of
whether Russia should win or lose the war in Ukraine, the Arctic 7 may
seek the eventual **re-normalization of Russia into Council activities
to resume full-scale Arctic coordination and cooperation**]{.underline}.
The Arctic 7 may reluctantly prefer this option over the continued
isolation of the largest Arctic state, which would undermine the
fundamental vision of circumpolar cooperation that prompted the
Council's creation in the first place.

[The Arctic remains an evolving arena for **geopolitical
competition**]{.underline} [between Russia and the U.S. and its Arctic
NATO allies, particularly as tensions have **increased** following
**Russia's invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline}. [To help mitigate risks
and preserve stability in the Arctic]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}
[and the U.S.,]{.underline} [along with the rest of the Arctic 7
countries]{.underline}, [must take care to ensure that increased human
activity and military capabilities in the region **do not lead to
accidental or inadvertent escalation**]{.underline} caused by
**[miscommunication]{.underline}** or **[misinterpretation of each
other's actions]{.underline}**. **[Despite the ongoing war in
Ukraine]{.underline}**, [maintaining lines of **diplomatic and military
communication**]{.underline} [with Russia on Arctic matters]{.underline}
[and re-normalizing Russia's participation on the Arctic Council to help
bolster Arctic **cooperation** and **stability may be effective methods
to help do so**]{.underline}.

#### US-Russia relations solve [extinction]{.underline}. Maintaining friendly relations over the Arctic is key.

[US-Russia talks]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin phone
call [signal a possible negotiation for peace in Ukraine and **new
opportunities** for the countries' relations, **including** in the
**Arctic region**.]{.underline}

[The Arctic]{.underline}, warming four times faster than the rest of the
world, [may be the key region for the **US** and **Russia** to **advance
cooperation**]{.underline}. [**US-Russia rapprochement**
may]{.underline} [broadly benefit the world by **bringing an end** to
the **disastrous war** in **Ukraine** and **reducing** the **risk of
nuclear war**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [**existential**
environmental **issues** still **demand attention**.]{.underline}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, **[Kirill
Dmitriev]{.underline}**, [CEO of the **Russian Direct Investment
Fund**]{.underline}, [named the region as a potential setting for
US-Russia cooperation]{.underline}: "[We need to pursue **joint
projects**]{.underline}, [including, for example, in the]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline}." The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for
cooperation as the two sides have explicitly expressed interest in
exploring cooperation in energy, investment, and geopolitical issues.
Western sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation
in the Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for
Arctic shipping. US officials now see Arctic cooperation as a potential
means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is
clear that many [are **interested** in **diverse forms** of **Arctic**
**cooperation**,]{.underline} from cultural diplomacy that celebrates
the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering
Strait, [to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate
hazards faced by both nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however,
are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the]{.underline} [countries' diplomatic missions]{.underline} [will
significantly **reduce** the **current obstacles** to US-**Russia
scientific cooperation** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. By making it
easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries, [Americans
and Russians]{.underline} [will]{.underline} again [be able
to]{.underline} [conduct joint research]{.underline}, expeditions, [and
scientific conferences]{.underline} and build models to better
understand the unfolding climate emergency. [Scientific
cooperation]{.underline} to understand the changes affecting sea ice,
permafrost, ecosystems, and local communities [has been blunted by the
**political fallout** of the **war** in **Ukraine**.]{.underline}

**[Cooperation]{.underline}** [in the Arctic can help **build regional
stability**]{.underline}. More importantly, **[Arctic]{.underline}**
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [will **build trust** between the
**US**]{.underline} [and **Russia** that could]{.underline}
[**complement** or **spill over** into other **crucial fields** of
**cooperation** such as **arms** **control**, **Middle East peace**, and
**global health**.]{.underline}

[**Russia** and the **U**nited **S**tates **discussed** possible
**cooperation** on energy projects in **the Arctic**]{.underline} at a
meeting in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO.

Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment
Fund (RDIF), said the economic conversations had been about broad
strokes, but that the two sides had discussed some "specific areas of
cooperation."

"It was more a general discussion --- maybe joint projects in the
Arctic. We specifically discussed the Arctic," Dmitriev said by phone as
he boarded a flight home after the talks in Riyadh.

The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst
and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and
Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine's future
without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies.

For his part, **[Trump]{.underline}** [aims to expand **American
influence** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, having repeatedly mused
about acquiring Greenland from Denmark --- and has refused to rule out
using military force or economic coercion to seize control of the
massive island with its vast mineral wealth and key strategic location.

U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian state oil major
Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic, but pulled out
in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in response to
Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Dmitriev was part of [a Russian delegation]{.underline} that included
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri
Ushakov and was in Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine.
Tuesday's talks were the first contact between officials from the two
sides following a call between Trump and Putin last week.

He [commented on the economic **track of the talks**]{.underline},
[which he **described** as **good**]{.underline}, but declined to go
into detail on the political discussions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by National Security Adviser Mike
Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

"[**Positive** after the **Biden administration** destroyed all of the
**communication**, **destroyed** all of the
**discussion**]{.underline}," he said.

In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the
RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around \$300 billion as a result of
leaving Russia following Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022.

"[There is an understanding that bad relations between Russia and the
U.S. actually cost a lot to American business, and there are ways to
have productive cooperation **benefit** both **Russia** and **the
U.S.**"]{.underline} he said.

"I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going
forward, but I think [**joint investments** between Russia]{.underline}
[and the U.S. are **now more likely** after this **meeting than
before**,]{.underline}" he added.

[On next steps, Dmitriev said the two sides had **agreed to set up
working groups** and have **regular high-level contacts**.]{.underline}
No further meetings have yet been scheduled.

The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on
projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign
fund was sidelined following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as
foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia.
Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a
statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

[The looming ice-breaker race is not as spectacular as the
aircraft-carrier race, which is in full swing already]{.underline}. And
yet, [such a race]{.underline} is likely to have significant detrimental
implications for the future of the Arctic. It [might inadvertently lead
to more tensions and **even** to **direct conflicts**]{.underline},
particularly if it overlaps with enhanced military activities in the
region. One can mention, for instance, that in early 2024, NATO
conducted its Nordic Response exercises involving about 50 military
vessels, more than 110 aircraft, 20,000 servicemen from 14 countries.
Later, Canada announced that it was going to purchase 12 modern
submarines specifically designed to operate in the Arctic region.

[The **good news**, however, is that the **West** might have a **deficit
of material resources** and **political will** to **wage** a
**large-scale ice-breaker race** with **Moscow** and
**Beijing**.]{.underline} One can recall that the fuss about the US
lagging behind Russia and China in the Arctic region repeats itself
every couple of years. [The last ice-breaker fever took place
under]{.underline} former US president Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**.
There was much speculation about how Washington could bring its presence
in the High North to a new level. However, [nothing much has really
happened since then]{.underline} - the new Invincible Armada has never
materialized. [It cannot fully be ruled out that exposed to harsh
**economic** and **political realities**]{.underline}, [**ICE** may
**soon start melting** like the North Polar ice cap is now melting, just
one of the severe effects of global warming.]{.underline}

As the world fixates on the battlefields of Ukraine and the volatile
Middle East, a quieter but no less consequential struggle is unfolding
in the Arctic. [Washington's latest maneuver---planning to acquire
**icebreakers**]{.underline} from Finland **[amid]{.underline}** what
some call [an "**Arctic crisis**"---signals a **bold escalation** in the
**polar region** in the context of **competition** with **Beijing** and
**Moscow**.]{.underline}

[This move]{.underline}, paired with the Danish Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen's recent trip to Greenland, and President Donald Trump's
proposed energy sanctions targeting Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG)
expansion (if he doesn't change his mind), reveals a troubling pattern:
once again, this [has everything to do with the US-led NATO's
**relentless** push to **encircle Russia**]{.underline}, [even at the
risk of **igniting a new geopolitical flashpoint**]{.underline} (even if
Trump seems to be "turning his back" to the Alliance).

[The Arctic,]{.underline} far from being a frozen backwater, [is poised
to become the next major arena of **U.S.-Russian contention**---a
development that exposes **Trump's America**]{.underline} **[imperial
ambitions]{.underline}** [and undermines claims of "**isolationism**" or
of **fostering peace** and **stability** for that matter.]{.underline}
Ironically, we now have an American president openly threatening (with
annexation) the sovereignty of NATO European "ally", Denmark, over the
issue of Greenland.

The icebreaker deal with Finland is no mere logistical upgrade. Trump
has framed it as a critical step "amid Arctic security concerns," with
Washington aiming to bolster its polar presence against Russia's
formidable fleet of over 36 icebreakers. One should pay attention also
to the trilateral ICE Pact with Canada and Finland; expert Daniel
McVicar (Research Director at White House Writers Group), predicts Trump
will expand it to counter "Russian influence."

Meanwhile, the Danish Prime Minister's visit to Greenland, underscores
Washington's broader strategy to secure strategic footholds in the
region. Greenland, a Danish territory, has long been a target of Trump's
fixation---he recently reiterated his desire to "get Greenland," ---a
notion Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a "serious" U.S.
intent. These moves are not about defense; they are about dominance.

Trump's proposed energy sanctions, exceeding the scope of the 2019
measures, aim to choke Russia's LNG ambitions, which are deeply tied to
the Arctic. Russia's Northern Sea Route, a thawing shipping lane along
its Arctic coast, promises to redirect energy exports to Asia,
circumventing Western chokeholds like the Suez Canal. By targeting this
lifeline, the U.S. seeks to kneecap Moscow's economic resilience---a
tactic less about security and more about maintaining American hegemony.
[The region's vast untapped resources]{.underline}, from oil and gas to
rare earth minerals, [only **heighten** the **stakes**]{.underline}. One
may recall that the U.S. (then still under President Joe Biden, mind
you) has already claimed a "huge portion of the ocean floor" from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic, a unilateral grab that flouts
international norms and highlights the American expansionist ethos.

Increasingly warm temperatures in the Arctic region, which facilitate
navigation, present a significant opportunity for the liquefied natural
gas industry, among other benefits, hence the strategic importance of
that area. Additionally (and relatedly), still during Biden's
administration, tensions have escalated in the Gulf of Finland. It's
worth noting that NATO's further expansion under Biden, incorporating
Sweden and Finland, has extended the Alliance's territory all the way to
Russia's eastern Arctic flank (the Bering Strait), thus leaving Russia
as the sole non-NATO country in the Arctic. This is the context for
Trump's Greenland and Arctic "obsession".

[NATO's cheerleaders might argue that all of this is a necessary
response to Russian "**aggression**."]{.underline} After all, they
claim, Moscow has militarized its Arctic frontier, with nuclear-powered
icebreakers and new combat vessels like the Ivan Papanin. [But this
narrative conveniently **ignores NATO's** own **history** of
**provocations**]{.underline}. [The alliance's **eastward
creep**---absorbing **Finland** and **Sweden**---has turned the **Gulf
of Finland** into a potential "**site of new conflict**," as I've
written before.]{.underline}

Finland's integration into the ICE Pact and its icebreaker expertise,
means that the Nordic country, once a neutral asset, now serves NATO's
agenda---even when the incumbent American President is accused of
"abandoning" the transatlantic alliance. [This shift has strained
**Arctic cooperation**]{.underline}, [with Russia excluded from regional
forums like the **Arctic Council** since **2022**]{.underline}. [Far
from **stabilizing** the **region**, the **U**nited **S**tates
**actions** are **fracturing it**.]{.underline}

The Greenland obsession epitomizes this overreach. Trump's fixation,
dismissed as eccentric in 2019, now aligns with a calculated NATO
strategy, even while Trumps go as far as to threaten a member ally such
as the Kingdom of Denmark. One may very well describe it as "part of a
scramble for the Arctic," (as Al-Jazeera called it) given Greenland's
strategic position astride key shipping routes and its mineral wealth.

Denmark is ramping up its Arctic defenses, yet its sovereignty over
Greenland is increasingly a bargaining chip in Washington's game.
Putin's remarks at an Arctic conference underscore Moscow's alarm: the
U.S. isn't just eyeing territory---it's projecting power into Russia's
backyard. This isn't deterrence; it's encirclement.

One must ask: who benefits from this Arctic gambit? Certainly not the
global commons. The ICE Pact and sanctions risk escalating tensions in a
region where cooperation---on climate, shipping, and resource
management---once held promise. [Even from an American perspective,
Russia's exclusion from Arctic dialogue pushes Moscow toward
China]{.underline} (the exact opposite of what Trump supposedly is
trying to achieve by means of a so-called "reverse Kissinger" strategy),
in a context of a New Cold War, thereby [forming a counter bloc that
could **destabilize the polar balance further**]{.underline}. China's
"Polar Silk Road" ambitions, paired with Russia's icebreaking prowess,
challenge NATO's aggressive dominance, yet the alliance's
response---more militarization, more sanctions---only deepens the
divide.

The Arctic should not be NATO's next frontier. Its transformation into a
geopolitical chessboard reflects the alliance's Cold War reflexes,
ill-suited to an emerging multipolar world. [Trump's icebreaker
push]{.underline} and energy sanctions **[may]{.underline}** bolster
U.S. leverage, but they also [**invite retaliation**---perhaps in the
Gulf of Finland, or through Russia's LNG pivot to Asia.]{.underline} [To
recap, the **U.S. claims** vast **swathes** of **seabed**, NATO tightens
its grip on Greenland, and Finland's shipyards churn out tools of
confrontation. **This isn't security**---it's a **recipe for
conflict**.]{.underline}

[A saner approach would **prioritize de-escalation**]{.underline}:
[**reintegrating Russia** into Arctic forums, negotiating
resource-sharing pacts, and curbing NATO's northward sprawl. The
**Arctic's future hinges** on **cooperation**, **not
conquest**]{.underline}. [Yet as Washington **doubles down**, dragging
its allies along, the ice grows thinner---both literally and
figuratively]{.underline}. In fact, [the next **U.S.-Russian clash** may
erupt not in Ukraine or Syria, but rather in the **frozen
north,**]{.underline} [where **NATO's hubris** could **spark a fire no
icebreaker can extinguish.**]{.underline}

#### The plan's [unilateral]{.underline} attempt at [Arctic competition]{.underline} [escalates]{.underline} tensions with Russia.

[The Arctic region]{.underline} [has rapidly emerged as a
**strategically** critical **geopolitical zone,**]{.underline} driven
largely by significant environmental changes that have unveiled new
economic and security opportunities. [With melting ice opening access to
vast reserves of]{.underline} oil, natural gas, and
**[minerals]{.underline}**, alongside emerging maritime routes like the
Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, [the **region** has become
**increasingly contested** by **major global powers**]{.underline}.
[Under the Trump administration, U.S. policy towards the Arctic was
assertively **reshaped**, prioritizing **energy independence**, national
security, and **economic deregulation**]{.underline}. [These shifts
highlight broader strategic ambitions while simultaneously sparking
debates around **environmental sustainability**, diplomatic cooperation,
and **geopolitical stability**.]{.underline}

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration's [policy reflected a **clear
emphasis** on exploiting the **Arctic's** **economic
potential**]{.underline} [through resource extraction and **increased
commercial** **shipping**.]{.underline} However, such a focus drew
significant criticism from environmentalists and indigenous communities,
concerned about the irreversible ecological impacts and acceleration of
climate change due to aggressive development strategies. The
administration's rollback of environmental protections to facilitate
drilling operations underscored its prioritization of short-term
economic benefits over long-term ecological sustainability.

A particularly striking illustration of Trump's Arctic strategy was his
repeated interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark, first expressed
publicly in 2019 and reiterated again more recently in 2025. This highly
controversial proposal highlighted Greenland's strategic importance,
particularly its potential as a base for military and economic
expansion, reflecting Trump's broader ambition to assert American
dominance in the region. Greenland's leadership swiftly and firmly
rejected the proposal, underscoring the significance of national
sovereignty and self-determination. This diplomatic tension illuminated
broader sensitivities and complexities in Arctic geopolitics, including
issues of sovereignty, national identity, and resource nationalism.

[The administration's focus also significantly addressed **national
security concerns** arising from **increased Russian military
activities** and strategic advancements in the Arctic.]{.underline} In
response, [the U.S. **intensified** its **military
presence**]{.underline}, [investing heavily in]{.underline} [**essential
infrastructure** like]{.underline} **[icebreakers]{.underline}** and
surveillance systems. [Trump-era]{.underline} [rhetoric]{.underline}
consistently **[emphasized]{.underline}** the need for American
leadership in safeguarding national interests, framing [the Arctic as a
critical arena for geopolitical competition, particularly **against
Russian**]{.underline} and Chinese **[ambitions]{.underline}**.

However, critics argued that [the **Trump** administration's **largely
unilateral**]{.underline} and [short-**sighted economic**
approach]{.underline} [**risked destabilizing** established multilateral
frameworks such as the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [These
frameworks]{.underline} historically [facilitated]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} among Arctic nations, providing a balanced
mechanism for managing shared resources, mitigating environmental risks,
and **[reducing geopolitical tensions]{.underline}**. [Trump's reduced
**commitment** to such cooperative frameworks risked alienating
traditional allies and **intensifying regional rivalries**,
**potentially undermining long-term stability.**]{.underline}

The economic opportunities presented by the Arctic region are
undoubtedly significant, particularly regarding shorter shipping routes
and abundant natural resources. Nonetheless, the risks posed by rapid
development without robust environmental safeguards are equally
substantial. The potential for ecological disasters, acceleration of
global climate impacts, and disruption of local indigenous communities'
livelihoods remain critical concerns. Additionally, heightened
geopolitical competition absent meaningful diplomatic engagement could
escalate tensions, increasing instability within the region.

Trump-era Arctic policy thus exemplifies a broader geopolitical
challenge: balancing immediate economic and national security interests
with the imperative for sustainable development and cooperative
international relations. As the Arctic continues to evolve due to
climate change and geopolitical pressures, it becomes increasingly
crucial for policymakers to adopt balanced, sustainable strategies.
These should emphasize not only resource management but also meaningful
engagement with indigenous communities, enhanced diplomatic
collaboration, and comprehensive environmental stewardship.

Ultimately, [the growing strategic importance of the Arctic in a new
Trump era underscores critical lessons in **geopolitical
decision-making**]{.underline}. Future policy must reconcile short-term
national ambitions with the long-term demands of ecological
sustainability and international cooperation. An integrated and nuanced
approach is essential to navigating the complex opportunities and
challenges emerging from this dynamically evolving region.

[For the US, communication lines between the **East** and the **West**
are served by the]{.underline} **[Panama Canal]{.underline}**, [rather
than by the Northwest Passage]{.underline} along the Canadian Arctic
coastline. Not only is the Passage very complicated for navigation, it
is also a matter of a long-term dispute between Washington and Ottawa -
the Canadian government considers the Passage as a part of Canadian
internal waters, while the US claims that this is an international
strait allowing free and unencumbered navigation. In any case, [it is
hard to imagine that either the US]{.underline}, or Canada, or any other
nation, [will invest dozens of billions of taxpayers\' dollars in trying
to turn the **Passage** into a major **international transportation
route**.]{.underline} The US and Canadian populations along the Arctic
coastline combined are much smaller than the Russian one. [The relative
**economic importance** of the **Arctic** **region** for **North
American nations** is much more limited than for **Eurasian
powers**.]{.underline}

In conclusion, [the ICE alliance has more **geopolitical** and
**geostrategic rationale** than **economic**.]{.underline} [The idea,
apparently, is to **confront Moscow** in **controlling** the

#### The Arctic is [critical]{.underline} for Russian security.

What are the stakes for **[Russia]{.underline}**?

On December 11, speaking at the convention for the development of key
residential areas in the Arctic region, Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**
[explicitly stated that the "**development** of the **Arctic** is an
**undisputed priority** for the **Russian Federation**]{.underline}" due
to its colossal geo-economic potential as well as a factor of Russia\'s
national security and defence.

In my view, however, [for Russia the value of the Arctic region well
exceeds **geo-economic interests** and rather **illusory security
concerns**]{.underline}. [In the **light** of **Russia\'s**]{.underline}
[post-2014 transformation translated into re-emerging neo-imperial
expansionism, it is clear that the **Arctic** has **transformed** into a
**fundamental pillar** of Russia\'s **statehood** and **national
identity**]{.underline}. At this juncture it is worth remembering that
in 2015---after Kremlin\'s neo-colonial territorial grab in Ukraine and
initiation of the new chapter of "adventures" on the Middle
East---Russia officially stepped forward with a territorial claim in the
Arctic, giving a new breath to the idea of "Arctic exceptionalism".

Thus, [one might theorize that **prospective** **geopolitical
defeat**]{.underline}(s) [in the Arctic]{.underline}---in addition to
overall humiliating course of Russia\'s war in Ukraine, economic
stagnation and traces of political discord best reflected in
Prigozhin\'s unsuccessful mutiny---[would have serious negative
consequences for **Kremlin\'s credibility** and its **image** both
**domestically** and **abroad**.]{.underline}

[The Arctic]{.underline}, often associated with serene landscapes and
wildlife, [is not just a picturesque region but a **strategically
important area** shaped]{.underline} [by **environmental**,
**political**]{.underline}, **[economic]{.underline}**, [and **military
forces**]{.underline}. During the Cold War, [it was a battleground
between the]{.underline} United States (**[US]{.underline}**), the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline}
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (**[USSR]{.underline}**).
Post-Cold War, [Arctic nations sought to preserve it as a zone of
cooperation]{.underline}.1) **[However]{.underline}**, [the **strategic
competition** among the US, Russia, and the People's Republic of
China]{.underline} (PRC) [has **significantly elevated its geopolitical
importance**]{.underline} in the past decade. [The **military
advancements** of Russia and PRC, in contrast to slower efforts by the
US and NATO, have turned the Arctic **into a critical focus for
security**]{.underline}, **[resource access]{.underline}**, and
**[control over emerging shipping routes]{.underline}**.

In 2009, global interest in the Arctic surged when the US Geological
Survey estimated the Arctic held 13 percent of the world's undiscovered
oil and 30 percent of the world's natural gas.2) That same year, the US
hosted the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting to reaffirm cooperation.
When Russia asserted its claims over arctic territory, **[the tone
shifted from collaboration to competition.]{.underline}** **[Russia's
tenor was not unprecedented]{.underline}**; in 2007, [Russian submarines
planted a Russian flag on the North Pole, proclaiming, "The Arctic is
Russian."]{.underline}3)

Meanwhile, [the **Arctic region** boasts **rich natural
resources**]{.underline}. It holds about 13% of the world\'s oil, 30% of
the natural gas, 25% of the coal, [and a significant amount of rare
minerals.]{.underline} [In December]{.underline} 2023, [the US
unilaterally announced its **claims** to extend its **continental**
**shelf** in the **Arctic Ocean** and **other regions**]{.underline}.
[It is widely believed that the **move** is **primarily driven** by a
**desire** to access the **rich mineral resources** in the
**region**,]{.underline} [particularly **lithium** for **battery
manufacturing** and **tellurium**]{.underline} [for solar **panel
production**]{.underline}. According to RIA Novosti, the Arctic Ocean
seabed is estimated to contain resources equivalent to 83 billion tons
of standard fuel. [The possibility of discovering new large-scale oil
and gas reserves in unexplored]{.underline} continental shelf [areas is
also **very high**]{.underline}. However, [the **unilateral pursuit** of
its **interests** by the **US undermines** the **peace** and
**stability** of the **Arctic region**]{.underline}. [Its **behavior**
is **detrimental** to the efforts of the international community to
jointly explore and **utilize Arctic resources** and **contradicts** the
**trend** of **peace** and **cooperation**.]{.underline}

Peace and stability in the Arctic provide a significant guarantee for
all activities in the region. [The US should not bring **conflict** and
**confrontation** into the **Arctic**]{.underline}. [Militarization and
**confrontational actions**]{.underline} not only fail to resolve Arctic

Take 2: With Russia effectively banished from Arctic cooperation, there
has been increasing media attention on the expansion of military
facilities, the testing of new weapons, military exercises, and even
statements about nuclear weapons use in the Arctic. Both sides -- NATO
states and Russia -- contribute to these frightening news developments.
[Representatives of the Russian military state that Russia's
militarization policy in the **Arctic** is a response to the buildup of
**NATO's active presence** in the region, claiming these
**developments** as an **hostile threat** to **national
security**]{.underline}. However, there is no smoke without fire.
[**Circumpolar states**, including NATO members, have witnessed Russia's
**growing militarization** of the region for **several
years**.]{.underline} [Concerns regarding Russian activity in the High
North have grown as a result of the country's aggressive and
unpredictable behavior, particularly after the invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. Provocative moves such as the recent test-launch
of a hypersonic Zircon cruise missile in the Barents Sea and the
nuclearisation of the Kola Peninsula are indeed alarming. The resulting
backlash, including the entry of Sweden and Finland into NATO, certainly
does not help in putting out the flames. To choose a strategy of
[**confrontation** **undermines** all existing and future **initiatives

Partly in response to all this activity, the United States is rebuilding
its own military capabilities in the region, which have atrophied since
the end of the Cold War. Besides tracking Russian submarines near the
GIUK gap, Washington has stepped up its strategic air patrols off the
coast of Siberia to probe Russian defense systems and gather other
intelligence. The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration also [plans to
build a **fleet of icebreakers** to **carry out** what it has
**referred** to as "**national** and **economic security**
**missions**"]{.underline} in the **[Arctic]{.underline}**.
[**Additional investments** will likely be necessary down
the]{.underline} line, both [to police **commercial activities** along
the **Alaskan coast** and throughout the U.S. **exclusive economic
zone**]{.underline} and to defend the country's commitment to freedom of
navigation in the polar region.

[Neither side's actions are **necessarily**]{.underline} [**aggressive**
in nature,]{.underline} nor do they portend an impending geopolitical
fight over who controls the region. In fact, Russia's military buildup
has taken place solely in areas where its legal authority is undisputed.
Submarine and aircraft activity near the GIUK gap and off the Alaskan
coast is a part of Russia's global strategy to deter potential military
attacks and not focused on the Arctic per se. Much the same is true of
U.S. actions in and around the region.

[At a time of **deepening distrust** between the United States and
Russia, however, the]{.underline} [danger is that **even actions** taken
for **legitimate security** **reasons** could spark **unnecessary
geopolitical tensions**]{.underline}. [**Hard-liners** in **both
countries**]{.underline}, [intent on **inflating** the **threat**, are
already painting a picture of the **Arctic** as a site of intense
**geopolitical competition**, and because the overall state of
U.S.-Russian relations is]{.underline} **[so dismal]{.underline}**,
[they are **gaining traction**]{.underline}. It is not difficult to
imagine an incident that would further reinforce their views. Russia,
for example, considers the Northern Sea Route to be within its
territorial waters, whereas the United States maintains that the passage
is in international waters. Should Washington insist on carrying out
freedom-of-navigation exercises there (as it did in May in the Barents
Sea, at the western end of the maritime route through Russian waters),
[a **standoff** with **Russia**, even a **military clash**, **might
ensue.**]{.underline}

[One can argue that there is **nothing wrong** with **international
competition**]{.underline}, [including in the **ice-breaker building

Russia]{.underline}**, [building ice-breakers is not a matter of
**geopolitical choice** or of great]{.underline} **[power
hype]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} [an absolute **social** and
**economic necessity**]{.underline}. Out of the overall 4 million people
who currently reside north of the Arctic Circle, approximately half live
in Russia. [The]{.underline} [largest Arctic cities also happen to be
Russian]{.underline} - Murmansk, Norilsk, Vorkuta, to mention a few.

alternatives offered by ground or air transportation would be much more
expensive.

As for Beijing, it released its Arctic Policy paper in 2018, in which
China was positioned as a \"Near-Arctic State.\" It is a major
stakeholder in the North, but its interests are confined mostly to
potential energy and other resource exploration as well as
transportation and wild-life preservation.

**[Russia]{.underline}** [began reinvesting in **Arctic affairs in the

complete control over the **Arctic Zone** of the **Russian Federation**

capabilities away from the Russian Arctic, and protecting perceived
vital interests along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Russia has been
rapidly militarizing NSR approaches, especially across critical choke
points,10 and modernizing local infrastructure.11

Under the impact of climate change, more waters and coastlines in and
close to the AZRF and the NSR are becoming accessible. [In Moscow's

[The growing **military ambitions** of the **Russian

-- [have generated **substantial insecurity** regarding future
**developments**, and thus created a **security
dilemma**]{.underline}.¹⁶³ As an example, in its most recent strategy
paper of November 2020, Sweden identified a "new military dynamic in the
Arctic region."¹⁶⁴ Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist explained
that an "armed attack on Sweden \[...\] could not be excluded," thereby
justifying his country's military rearmament. From 2021 to 2025 defence
spending will rise by 40 percent, and even by 85 percent compared to
2014 levels.¹⁶⁵ [Amidst security dilemmas, insecure countries typically
**react** by feeling **obliged** to **strengthen their military
capabilities.**]{.underline} [This creates a **spiral of competition for
power** and ultimately leads to a **reduction**, **rather** than
**increase**,]{.underline} [in the **security** of all **involved
actors**]{.underline}.¹⁶⁶ The US and other NATO members have already

measures they have applied]{.underline} -- **[namely]{.underline}**
rearmament, exercises, and [redeployment]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
operational **[resources]{.underline}** -- must be embedded in a
well-balanced combination of deterrence, defence, and dialogue.

Conflict Prevention through Dialogue and Cooperation

[As **activities**]{.underline} [and **competition** for **access to**
and **influence** in the **Arctic increase**]{.underline}, [so the need
for mechanisms also grows that can overcome tensions, maintain dialogue,
and **improve cooperation**]{.underline}. [Without such a framework,
there is a risk that a **misunderstanding** or **misperception**
following an **accident** could **escalate** into an **unintended armed
conflict**. It is therefore essential for **Arctic countries** to
conduct a **dialogue** on **issues** of **military
security**.]{.underline} If this exchange is then institutionalised, it
is more likely that the intentions behind individual states' Arctic
security policy become more transparent. [Ideally, this would defuse the
security dilemma for all those involved, slow down the build-up of
military capacities, and create the foundations for a future security
architecture.]{.underline}

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
nuclear war between the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and **Russia**]{.underline}, despite horrific casualties, [neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the
direct effects of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The
aftermath could be **much worse**]{.underline}: the
[burning]{.underline} of [flammable materials could send massive amounts
of smoke into the atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight
and cause sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural
disruption -- **[a nuclear winter]{.underline}**. According to one model
9 , [an all-out exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to
a drop in global temperatures of around 8°C, making it **impossible to
grow food for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave some
survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but they
would be in a very precarious situation and the **threat of extinction**
from other sources **would be great**. An exchange on this scale is
**only possible**]{.underline} [**between the US and Russia** who have
more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with
stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each, although many are not
operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that even [a small
regional nuclear war involving 100 nuclear weapons would]{.underline}
produce a nuclear winter serious enough to [put two billion]{.underline}
people [at risk]{.underline} of starvation,12 [though this]{.underline}
estimate **[might be pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale
are **unlikely to lead to**]{.underline} outright **[human
extinction]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts which
are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns. [It
is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
**existential risk from nuclear war**]{.underline} over the next
century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence intervals.
According to many experts, [the most likely nuclear war]{.underline} at
present [is between India and Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given
the relatively modest size of their arsenals, the risk of human
extinction is **plausibly greater** from a conflict between the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**Russia**]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have increased
in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the possibility of
them rising further in the future.

WASHINGTON --- It [has the makings of a new Cold War, or
worse.]{.underline} The [**deep chill in U.S.-Russian relations** is
stirring concern in some quarters that Washington and Moscow are in
danger of stumbling into an **armed confrontation that, by mistake or
miscalculation, could lead to nuclear war**]{.underline}. American and
European analysts and current and former U.S. military officers say the
[nuclear superpowers **need to talk more**]{.underline}. A foundational
[[arms control agreement is being
abandoned]{.underline}](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/02/13/nato-is-getting-ready-for-a-russia-with-a-lot-more-missiles/)
and the last major limitation on strategic nuclear weapons could go away
in less than two years. Unlike during the Cold War, when generations
lived under threat of a nuclear Armageddon, the two militaries are
barely on speaking terms. \"[During the Cold War, we understood each
other\'s signals. We talked]{.underline},\" says the top NATO commander
in Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is about to retire.
\"I\'m concerned that we don\'t know them as well today.\" Scaparrotti,
in his role as [[Supreme Allied Commander
Europe]{.underline}](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/03/05/top-us-general-seeks-more-troops-warships-in-europe-to-counter-russia/),
has met only twice with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian
general staff, but has spoken to him by phone a number of other times.
\"I personally think [communication is a very **important part of
deterrence**]{.underline},\" Scaparrotti said, referring to the idea
that adversaries who know each other\'s capabilities and intentions are
less likely to fall into conflict. \"So, I think [we should have more
communication with Russia]{.underline}. It [would ensure that we
understand each other and why we are doing what we\'re
doing]{.underline}.\" He added: \"It doesn\'t have to be a lot.\" The
United States and Russia, which together control more than 90 percent of
the world\'s nuclear weapons, say that in August they will leave the
1987 treaty that banned an entire class of nuclear weapons. And there
appears to be little prospect of extending the 2010 New
[[Start]{.underline}](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/04/14/the-chill-in-us-russia-relations-has-some-worried-about-stumbling-into-a-military-conflict/)
treaty that limits each side\'s strategic nuclear weapons. After a
period of post-Cold War cooperation on nuclear security and other
defense issues, [the relationship between Washington and Moscow took a
nosedive]{.underline}, particularly [after Russian forces entered the
former Soviet republic of Georgia]{.underline} in 2008. Tensions spiked
with Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and its [[military
intervention in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/26/russias-conflict-with-ukraine-an-explainer/).
In response, Congress in 2016 severely limited military cooperation with
Russia. The law prohibits \"military-to-military cooperation\" until the
secretary of defense certifies that Russia \"has ceased its occupation
of Ukrainian territory\" and \"aggressive activities.\" The law was
amended last year to state that it does not limit military talks aimed
at \"reducing the risk of conflict.\" [Relations frayed even further
amid U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election]{.underline}, although President Donald Trump has
doubted Russian complicity in what U.S. intelligence agencies assert was
an effort by Moscow to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House.
After a [[Helsinki summit with
Putin]{.underline}](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/07/18/trump-backs-down-under-fire-clarifies-on-russia-meddling/)
in July, Trump publicly accepted the Kremlin leader's denial of
interference. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said in an interview Friday that Russian behavior is to blame
for the strained relationship. \"It\'s very difficult for us to have
normal relationships with a country that has not behaved normally over
the last few years,\" Dunford said. \"There are [major issues that
affect our bilateral relationship that have to be
addressed]{.underline}, to include where Russia has violated
international laws, norms and standards.\" Dunford said he speaks
regularly with Gerasimov, his Russian counterpart, and the two sides
talk on other levels. \"I\'m [satisfied right now with our
military-to-military communication to **maintain a degree of
transparency** that **mitigates the risk of
miscalculation**]{.underline},\" he said. \"I think we have a framework
within to manage a crisis, should one occur, at the senior
military-to-military level.\" James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral
who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013, says the
West must confront Russia where necessary, including on its
interventions in Ukraine and Syria. But he believes there room for
cooperation on multiple fronts, including [[the
Arctic]{.underline}](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/04/04/with-missiles-pointing-out-to-sea-northern-clover-stakes-russian-claim-on-arctic-waters/)
and arms control. \"We are **[in danger of stumbling backward into a
Cold War that is to no one\'s advantage]{.underline}**,\" he said in an
[[email]{.underline}](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/04/14/the-chill-in-us-russia-relations-has-some-worried-about-stumbling-into-a-military-conflict/)
exchange. \"Without steady, political-level engagement between the
defense establishments, the risk of a true new Cold War rises
steadily.\" No one is predicting a deliberate Russian act of war in
Europe, but [the decline in regular talks is a worry to
many.]{.underline} Moscow says it is ready to talk. \"[**Russia remains
open** for interaction aimed at de-escalating tension, **restoring
mutual trust**, **preventing any misinterpretations** of one another\'s
intentions, and **reducing the risk of dangerous
incidents**]{.underline},\" the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
in a statement last week in response to NATO\'s 70th anniversary
celebration. Sam Nunn, who served in the Senate as a Democrat from
Georgia from 1972 to 1997, argues that dialogue with Russia is too
important to set aside, even if it carries domestic political risk.
\"You can\'t call time out,\" he said in an interview. \"[The nuclear
issues go on, and they\'re getting more dangerous]{.underline}.\" Nunn
co-wrote an opinion piece with former Secretary of State George Shultz
and former Defense Secretary William Perry arguing that the [U.S. and
its allies and Russia are caught in a \"policy incapacity
~~paralysis~~\" that could lead to a military confrontation and
potentially the first use of nuclear weapons since the U.S. bombed Japan
in August 1945.]{.underline} \"A bold policy shift is needed,\" they
wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, \"to support a strategic
re-engagement with Russia and walk back from this perilous precipice.
Otherwise, our nations may soon be entrenched in a nuclear standoff more
precarious, disorienting and economically costly than the Cold War.\" A
group of U.S., Canadian, European and Russian security experts and
former officials in February issued a call for talks with Russia on
crisis management. \"The [**risks of mutual misunderstanding** and
**unintended signals that stem from an absence of dialogue** relating to
crisis management]{.underline} \... are real,\" the Euro-Atlantic
Security Leadership Group said in a statement. It said this [could lead
to conventional war with Russia or, in a worst-case
scenario]{.underline}, "the **[potential for nuclear threats, or even
nuclear use, where millions could be killed in minutes]{.underline}**."

The bear in the room

[When it comes to dealing with the **potential disease** **dangers**
emanating from a **warming Arctic**]{.underline}, [there is a **giant
bear** in the **room**]{.underline}. Many [researchers are frustrated
because they **cannot get data** or **cooperation out of
Russia**]{.underline}. Romanovsky, a Russian native, was formerly
affiliated with Moscow State University, but he can no longer do
research in Russia, he says ruefully, because he gave an interview to a
radio program considered "undesirable" and could be sentenced to five
years in a Russian prison for it.

[**Knowledge of public health** in the **Russian Arctic has
atrophied**]{.underline}. Russia aims to extract resources, ignoring
economic constraints and disregarding international environmental and
public health codes, Romanovsky says. [It]{.underline} [may be the most
important region to monitor, but also remains the **least likely** to be
**monitored** or share its **data internationally**.]{.underline}
[Russia's willful isolation affects every aspect of climate change in
the Arctic, including its potential role in **pathogens'** **evolution**
and **migration**.]{.underline}

[The lack of plentiful and **robust data** means that it is **almost
impossible** to attach a **realistic probability** of risk to the
**possible emergence** of **Arctic pathogens**]{.underline}. But we know
that human activity---development, shipping, extraction,
hunting---creates favorable conditions for microbial spread and
evolution, and we know the Arctic is entering a phase in which human
activities are expanding. The world can't afford to allow uncertainty,
lack of data, and disciplinary siloes to obscure the range of possible
ways microbes will behave in the altered Arctic that is shaping up. They
are the most resilient entities on our planet, after all.

#### 1. US-Russian relations are in the gutter

MOSCOW, June 11 (Reuters) - [Talks between Russia and the United States
aimed at improving ties and removing \"irritants\" in their relationship
are **not expected to yield quick results**]{.underline}, the Kremlin
said on Wednesday.

\"Well, let\'s say that [there are **a lot of blockages** in bilateral
relations]{.underline}. Of course, [one can hardly hope for any quick
results,]{.underline} but this is precisely the kind of complex
step-by-step work that has begun and will continue,\" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told reporters, denying that dialogue had stalled.

Since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, the two
countries have launched a series of contacts aimed at improving
relations which the Kremlin had described as \"below zero\" under the
previous administration of Joe Biden.

Both sides say there is huge potential for business and investment deals
if relations improve. But **[Trump]{.underline}**, [despite holding four
phone calls with President Vladimir Putin]{.underline}, [has **voiced
frustration**]{.underline} [about]{.underline} [Russia\'s war **actions
in Ukraine** and the lack of any **visible progress towards a peace
deal**]{.underline}.

Russia\'s new ambassador to Washington said earlier on Wednesday that
U.S.-Russia bilateral talks would soon move to Moscow from Istanbul.

\"**[The recovery of Russian-American relations is still a long way
off]{.underline}**,\" ambassador Alexander Darchiev told TASS news
agency, adding that the rapprochement was [being slowed by the so-called
U.S. \"**deep state**\" and **anti-Russian \"hawks\" in
Congress**.]{.underline}

#### 2. Arctic deterrence is failing now. Building new icebreakers is key to deter Russia.

Winter is coming early this year in the Arctic. Last month, a Chinese
and Russian joint surface action group came within 75 nautical miles of
Kiska Island, Alaska. In response, the Coast Guard mobilized a patrol to
monitor the ships as they approached American home waters. A year prior,
several Chinese warships had entered the U.S. exclusive economic zone
off Alaska.

[These **repeated tests** of **American resolve** so close to our
**shores** should **set off alarm** **bells** in
**Washington**]{.underline}. Our two greatest adversaries, **[China and
Russia]{.underline}**, [are now cooperating on the **high seas** to
**challenge** our **presence** in the **region**.]{.underline}

[Chinese and Russian attempts to gain superiority in the Arctic are not
new]{.underline}. In 2015, five Chinese vessels marked President Barack
Obama's visit to the Bering Sea with battle drills off the Alaskan
coast. [Russia has long maintained a strong military presence in the
**Arctic**, even after the **end** of the **Cold War**.]{.underline}

[What is different now, however, is that our **rivals' power
projection** in the polar regions is **outpacing our own**]{.underline}.
As a self-described "near-Arctic power," China has been working to build
a "Polar Silk Road" of economic and military infrastructure across the
Arctic. Meanwhile, [**Russia** is developing its **already-formidable
capabilities** to disrupt freedom of **navigation** and **U.S.
operations.**]{.underline}

[If China and Russia reach their goals, the Arctic will emerge as a
central theater in our **respective** **competitions**]{.underline}.
[Alaska]{.underline} [is]{.underline} a [vital]{.underline} location
[for monitoring Chinese and Russian **missile forces**]{.underline}.
[The Arctic's natural characteristics also make it ripe for **space
launch**, **reconnaissance**, and energy resource capture]{.underline}.
[Losing **the upper hand** in the]{.underline} [Arctic could result in
our **exclusion** from the **region militarily** and
economically]{.underline} --- an ominous prospect, given the trajectory
of American relations with Russia and China.

The United States has already been caught flat-footed, as we have
invested relatively little in our Arctic forces. For example, [the
combined **icebreaker fleets** of our adversaries **outpace** ours by
more than **25 to 1.**]{.underline}

[U.S. leaders simply have not met the Arctic challenge,]{.underline} and
we are only beginning to confront this reality now. In recent months,
the Biden Administration has created new posts at the Pentagon and State
Department to address Arctic security. And more recently, the White
House rolled out a comprehensive political-military strategy for the
Arctic, which includes a call for a greater military presence in the
region.

[Our core challenge, however, is that the U.S. defense industrial base
will essentially be starting from scratch to field these
capabilities]{.underline}. Decades of low investment in icebreakers from
the federal government has left U.S. shipbuilders unprepared to service
even the best defense strategy. Today, only one shipyard in the United
States is building polar icebreakers, and we are set to add just three
of these crucial ships by 2030. [Without **sustained investment** in
these **capabilities**, there is little hope of maintaining **long-term
U.S. power** in the **region**.]{.underline}

Congress has worked to authorize funding for a twelfth national security
cutter in this year's defense bill, but much more needs to be done. [We
need to **expand** the **icebreaker program** and substantially increase
the budget for U.S. Northern Command]{.underline}, which would give
planners the tools they need to navigate this unstable strategic
environment.

Russia and China's latest target, Kiska Island, became known during
World War II as one of few U.S. territories ever to be occupied by a
foreign nation. Japanese control of the island came to an end in 1943
when Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and his cruisers expelled the Japanese.
Since then, U.S. forces have continued a proud tradition of Arctic
operations, including the first deployment of a nuclear submarine in
1954.

It appears Kiska --- and indeed the United States --- is once again
coming under threat from a Pacific power. [The **moment** demands that
we **unleash the full might** of our **defense industrial base** to
**secure our foothold** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [As the proverbial
winter with **China** and **Russia comes**, we should **prepare
ourselves to weather it**.]{.underline}

In fact, while Trump criticizes his predecessors for mishandling Russia,
he risks overlooking the lessons of previous U.S. administrations.
[Those who believed that]{.underline} **[normalizing
relations]{.underline}** and engaging constructively [with **Moscow**
would lead to peace were **proven wrong**.]{.underline} From George W.
**[Bush]{.underline}** to Barack **[Obama]{.underline}**, [each
**administration**]{.underline} [tried to **reset
relations**]{.underline} with Russia, only [to see the **Kremlin
escalate**]{.underline}---[first by]{.underline} invading
[Georgia]{.underline} in 2008 [and then]{.underline} annexing
[Crimea]{.underline} in 2014. By repeating this mistake, [the U.S. may
inadvertently **enable Russia** to achieve its strategic goals,
**undermining** the **security of Europe** and the **broader
international order**.]{.underline}

Putin's desire to speak directly to his U.S. counterparts reflects his
desire to return to a model of great-power politics, where the United
States and Russia can negotiate as equals and agree on spheres of
influence. [Putin sees Russia as a global power with a **legitimate
right** to **dominate the post-Soviet space**, which he **views** as
part of **Russia's rightful** **sphere** of **influence**.]{.underline}

Similarly, Trump has shown signs of an expansionist mindset, aiming to
assert U.S. dominance through both military and economic power. He has
suggested using military force to secure control over the Panama Canal
and Greenland, as well as using economic coercion to gain control of
Canada. While the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration [risks
**putting** the **future** of trans-Atlantic relations to the
test]{.underline}, [Russia sees an **opportunity** to **exploit
divisions** within the West.]{.underline}

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the U.S.
and Russian militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[been]{.underline} **[very careful]{.underline}** [to avoid directly
shooting at one another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might
end.]{.underline}** Q: [Are we close to full-scale world
war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No. The U.S. has **not
attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not attacked** the
U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely likely at this
point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of Russian military strikes
on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is there a more likely course of Russian
retaliation against the U.S.? D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be
regarded as **extremely unlikely**]{.underline}. [If such an attack were
to take place, the U.S. would]{.underline} **[likely seek to
respond]{.underline}** [in a way that is **proportional**]{.underline}
[but **not escalatory.**]{.underline} [**Uncertainty** about what would
lead to]{.underline} **[escalation]{.underline}** [explains why the U.S.
and Russia take]{.underline} **[such care]{.underline}** [to avoid
direct combat]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [Russians understand that they **too are
vulnerable**]{.underline}. It is also quite likely that [with Russian
forces already **overextended** fighting against **Ukraine**, Russian
leaders realize that a **second major conflict** is not in their
interest.]{.underline} Q: Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the
cost of war for Russia, in terms of the human toll and economics? Has
Russia made resource and allocation adjustments in the past months that
will allow it to sustain these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war
efforts appear to be unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of
soldiers and expended significant amounts of ammunition, such that
commanders in the field are complaining about shortages and are
suggesting that they may soon have to switch from offense to defense,
which is less costly in terms of people and materiel. Overall, the
Russian economy is holding up. Growth is very slow, and shortages of
various imported goods are mounting, but there are no signs that
economic factors will severely constrain the war effort any time soon.
However, it would appear that [before the Russian military could
undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline}, [a significant
**program of recruitment**,]{.underline} **[training]{.underline}**,
[and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need to take place]{.underline}.
[It appears that Russia **cannot retake**]{.underline} [the offensive in
2023.]{.underline}

Broaden our focus. [One **common** cause of **failure** in dealing with
a wicked problem is to treat it as if it were a **narrow linear
problem**]{.underline}, [rooted in a single]{.underline} or primary
[cause that can be resolved through a focused]{.underline} and
determined [effort]{.underline}. [The **U**nited **S**tates has
**repeatedly crashed** into this shoal in its **attempts** to **deal

focus on]{.underline} disputes that are salient to U.S. domestic
politics and on **[selective opportunities]{.underline}** that we hope

of bilateral maladies, recently attributing the growing dangers in the
U.S.-Russian relationship to the nature of Putinism and Russia's endemic
expansionism, believing resolute counter-pressure will quell Russian
appetites for aggression. [We have attempted to seek progress through
**incremental steps**]{.underline}, [in the **hope** that making
**headway** on such issues as counter-terrorism can build **momentum**
toward larger U.S.-Russian success]{.underline}. [This incremental and
compartmentalized approach makes]{.underline} abundant [sense
intuitively]{.underline}. Why complicate things, when one can break the
problem down into its component parts and focus on what is most salient
or easily achievable? It is also driven by the bureaucratic silo effect,
which encourages narrow specialization while discouraging
cross-organizational integration. [But **it has not worked** in
practice]{.underline}. [Despite our best efforts, the U.S.-Russian
relationship has **spiraled** ever deeper into **dysfunction and
distrust**]{.underline} [from admin]{.underline}istration [to
admin]{.underline}istration since the end of the Cold War. As planning
expert Russell Ackoff has observed about "messes," his term for wicked
problems, "[if we do the usual thing and break up a mess into its
component problems]{.underline} and then try to solve each one
separately, [we will **not solve the mess**]{.underline}.''

#### Trump's strategy takes US-Russian relations on a roller coaster ride\-\--there's no UQ for the DA

It means, literally, American Hills. How appropriate. After all,
[with]{.underline} President Donald [Trump now operating the
ride,]{.underline} [and Vladimir Putin pressing some of the
buttons]{.underline}, **[US-Russian relations have become one of late,
with highs and lows and twists and turns]{.underline}**. [You never know
quite where you are now]{.underline}. Analysing geopolitical trends is
hard enough at the best of times. It\'s even harder careering along on
the American Hills of the 47th US president. When Trump returned to the
White House in January, his direction of travel was clear: he set out to
repair relations with Russia. There were Trump/Putin phone calls,
high-level US-Russia negotiations. At one point Washington voted with
Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the
\"aggressor\" in Russia\'s war against Ukraine. Whenever the Trump
administration exerted pressure, it was always on Kyiv, never on the
Kremlin. But a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.
[After]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin had proposed replacing]{.underline}
President Volodymyr [Zelensky\'s administration with \"external
governance]{.underline}\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN,
President [Trump made it known that **he was \"angry\" with
Putin**.]{.underline} \"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the
things that were said over the last day or two having to do with
Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when \[Putin\]
considers Zelensky not credible, he\'s supposed to be making a deal with
him. Whether you like him or you don\'t like him.\" After a day playing
golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, told the
Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is also the
president of the United States, is running out of patience with
Russia.\" **[Trump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of up to 50%
on Russian oil exports]{.underline}** [if]{.underline} [Russia was found
to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal. A bi-partisan group of
US senators has gone even further]{.underline}. [They\'ve drawn up a
bill that would impose **500% secondary tariffs** on countries that
purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.]{.underline} Up to this
point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in relations between
Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper last month ran
a headline stating that US and Russian officials had \"started speaking
the same language\". This week things changed. On Wednesday, Moskovsky

Moscow and Washington? And yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs
this week, Russia wasn\'t on the list. Instead, US authorities had
organised a sanctions waiver for a key Kremlin official: Putin\'s
foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Dmitriev flew into Washington
for talks with the Trump administration. A sign, perhaps, of Russia and
America getting on with the business of... getting along? But on Friday,
another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a meeting of
Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. \"President Trump\'s not going to
fall into the trap of endless negotiations about negotiations,\" said US
Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"We will know soon enough, in a matter
of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not.\"

MOSCOW (AP) --- [Russia-U.S. **relations** are in a state of
**"unprecedented crisis"** without]{.underline} any [**sign** of
**improvement**]{.underline}, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov argued that [the White House's
emphasis on increasing]{.underline} weapons [supplies to
**Ukraine**]{.underline} to ensure Russia's defeat [leaves no room for
**diplomacy**]{.underline}.

"[I don't see any prospect for a productive **political** and
**diplomatic process**]{.underline}," Ryabkov said at a briefing. "We
have a very deep and unprecedented crisis in Russia-U.S. relations. The
[Biden]{.underline} administration [has driven them into a
**deadlock**]{.underline}."

Ryabkov warned that the U.S. and its allies must carefully assess the
risks stemming from supplying increasingly powerful Western weapons to
Ukraine.

"The Americans need to thoroughly and deeply weigh the risks linked to
their unabashedly cavalier course," he said.

Ryabkov noted that [Moscow doesn't **trust** Western **statements**
about self-imposed **restrictions**]{.underline} on a range of weapons
supplied to Ukraine [in order to avoid **escalation**]{.underline},
adding that [such assurances in the past have served as **cover** for a
**steady expansion**]{.underline} of the assortment of arms deliveries.

"We don't see any sign of reason in any of the NATO and EU members'
capitals," Ryabkov said. "What they are doing isn't going to strengthen
their security."

He rejected the U.S. argument that Russia's refusal to allow the
resumption of inspections of its nuclear facilities represents a breach
of the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact
between the two countries.

The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than
1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.
The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify
compliance.

Just days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia
and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.

Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START
since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused
to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact's future.
Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations
under the treaty.

The U.S. State Department last week said that Russia's refusal to allow
the inspections "prevents the United States from exercising important
rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian
nuclear arms control." It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors
from conducting inspections of the U.S. facilities.

Ryabkov on Thursday insisted that Russia has continued to comply with
the treaty and exchange information in accordance with it. "We adhere to
the treaty and observe its provisions," he said.

At the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow's view that resuming inspections
wasn't possible in the current environment.

Ryabkov's comments followed a Russian Foreign Ministry's statement
declaring that [it was **impossible** to **maintain "business as
usual"** with Washington at a time when "the U.S. has]{.underline}
effectively [unleashed a]{.underline} total [**hybrid war** against
**Russia**]{.underline}, which is fraught with a real danger of a direct
military confrontation between the two nuclear powers."

[Moscow seeks to **appropriate** the **NSR** as a **body** of **internal
waters regulated by Russian law,**]{.underline} [and no longer linked to
**UNCLOS** under the **principles of freedom** of **navigation** and
**innocent passage**]{.underline}. [This obsession for control responds
to the fear of '**encirclement'** in the **Arctic** and the
**unwarranted belief** that **NATO** will soon **contest** the
self-appropriation of the NSR.]{.underline}

Russian fears have crystallized in the belief that NATO or the United
States are willing to conduct a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP)
through the NSR to 'test' innocent passage in contested waters. [Most of
**these fears** **remain unfounded**, **especially** since there is
**little value** in **arranging** such an **operation** as well as high
operational risk]{.underline}.22)

[The fact remains that the Kremlin's]{.underline} [rhetoric]{.underline}
around a potential Western-led FONOP [has grown **aggressive in recent
months**]{.underline}, [with NATO arguably seeking to
'snatch]{.underline}'23) [the **NSR** from under **Russia's
control**]{.underline}. Furthermore, the Russian armed forces and the
FSB (in charge of the Coast Guard and Border Guard) have reportedly been
making plans to 'counter'24) a potential foreign FONOP.

Finally, [with its attacks on **Ukraine**, Russia has **officially
debunked** the]{.underline} oft-repeated [narrative]{.underline} that
[its]{.underline} economic [interests guarantee its participation in
preserving regional **peace** and **stability**. Moscow has **long
harbored grand designs** of developing its vast **Arctic coastline** and
extracting **more** of the resources found off them]{.underline}. As a
result, many believed it would have an interest in maintaining peace and
stability in the Arctic, so that it could attract foreign investment to
these projects and increase cargo traffic in the Northern Sea Route. But
[it's **hard**]{.underline} to believe in this logic, or [to take
**comfort** in reports of Russia's relatively **restrained conduct** in
the Arctic]{.underline}, at a time [when its government has
**substantially increased** its **military assets** in the region
and]{.underline} when Russian President Vladimir [Putin is **openly
threatening war**]{.underline} if other states cross his red lines.

The West's unease on these points can be seen clearly in its
surprisingly robust and united effort to pull the plug on the Russian
economy by imposing coordinated sanctions on its key sectors. However,
Western leaders will also need to grapple with another dimension of
great-power politics as they attempt to isolate Moscow: the
inevitability of greater Chinese presence in the Arctic, and, more
broadly, the presence of other non-Arctic states.

As Western capital and technologies depart from Russia's energy sector,
[Moscow will be **more prone** to cooperate with **Beijing**
on]{.underline} developing [its Arctic resources, an outcome that would
further complicate Arctic governance]{.underline} by directly exposing
it to the dynamics of the U.S.-China great-power rivalry. And if Beijing
increases its commercial stakes in the Arctic, that would also make it
harder for the U.S. to denounce China's once-ridiculed narrative that it
is a "near-Arctic" state that should be included in any regional
agenda-setting initiatives.

[The **Arctic** is no longer just a **frozen expanse**---it is **quickly
becoming a geopolitical hotspot**]{.underline}. As its ice diminishes,
its economic potential has increased. Arctic shipping routes between the
Atlantic and Pacific offer the potential to reduce travel times by up to
40%, and the area is estimated to contain 13% of the world's
undiscovered oil and 30% of its untapped natural gas reserves. However,
[far less attention has been given to what is required for successful
**U.S. deterrence** in the Arctic, **particularly in countering Russia's
assertiveness.**]{.underline}

[The Arctic is **particularly valuable** for **America's
competitors**]{.underline}. [Russia has used the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} (NSR) [to bypass the West\'s \$60-per-barrel oil
price cap]{.underline}. In 2023, a record 80% of Russian oil exports
were shipped via non-G7 tankers, avoiding the cap, with exports to China
rising by 23% since the invasion of Ukraine. Oil shipments along the NSR
have also surged, growing from zero before the war to over ten in 2023.
[Given the Arctic\'s strategic]{.underline} economic and **[military
importance]{.underline}**, the U[.S. must bolster its **infrastructure**
and military **capabilities** for **successful deterrence**, which it
currently lacks.]{.underline}

During his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier
this year, General Gregory M. Guillot, the Commander of the U.S.
Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), warned that "we're severely outnumbered"
and have limited "freedom of maneuver" in the Arctic. [The numbers
**concerning icebreakers**, which are crucial for **enabling naval
forces** to **navigate ice-covered waters**, are **particularly
stark**]{.underline}. [Compared to Russia's seven **nuclear-powered**
and thirty diesel-powered icebreakers]{.underline}, [the **U.S.
operates** only **two diesel-powered icebreakers**]{.underline}. Since
the Polar Sea, one of the U.S.'s two heavy polar icebreakers, suffered
an engine casualty in 2010, the Coast Guard has relied on the Polar Star
as its sole operational heavy icebreaker.

Meanwhile, **[Russia]{.underline}** [continues to **expand its
icebreaker** **fleet** to reinforce its regional
**dominance**]{.underline}. Through its Project 22220 initiative,
[Russia is developing at least six **nuclear-powered
icebreakers**]{.underline}: three already built, a fourth under
construction, and two more in development. [Decades of sustained
investment have given Russia a **commanding** **presence** in the
Arctic---one that the **U.S. is currently unprepared to
counter.**]{.underline}

Delays and rising costs have beset efforts to modernize its Arctic
icebreaker fleet. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program won't deliver
its first icebreaker ready until 2029. Unresolved design issues and
rising material and labor costs have increased the price of the first
three ships by 39 percent. As a result, the Coast Guard must spend \$15
million per year to repair the aging Polar Star, which first entered
service in 1976. The U.S. Coast Guard assessed that America needs at
least eight icebreakers -- four heavy and four medium ships -- for its
future polar missions. Without a shift in Arctic policy, the U.S. and
its allies may struggle to counter Russia's increasing influence.

Such a shift will require collaboration. Currently, the U.S. ranks 19th
in global shipbuilding. Increased coordination with allies is essential
to reduce costs, accelerate production, and innovate. In July 2024, the
U.S., Canada, and Finland launched the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
(ICE Pact) to pool resources and enhance polar capabilities. While the
ICE Pact is a key step in strengthening the West\'s Arctic strategy,
further cooperation with NATO allies is needed, especially as a Pentagon
report from July 2024 warned of growing Arctic ties between Russia and
China.

[Long-term icebreaker needs cannot be met without greater shipbuilding
cooperation with allies]{.underline}. Two existing laws prevent the
Coast Guard from building vessels or major components in foreign
shipbuilding ports. The President can authorize an exception if it is in
the national security interest -- and this clearly is. Both Canada and
Finland are close NATO allies with a shared interest in countering
Russian power in the Arctic. If the President is serious about closing
the force projection gap, exemptions to allow shipbuilding collaboration
with our allies will be necessary.

[In addition to icebreaker production, increased **military
cooperation** with allies is crucial for **effective
deterrence**]{.underline}. Access to Alaska's Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base has enabled the U.S. and
its allies to conduct joint military exercises, such as the Arctic
Defender exercise in July 2024, which involved approximately 500
personnel from the U.S., Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France.
Expanding exercises like Arctic Defender -- particularly among other
Arctic nations -- would further bolster interoperability, improve
operational readiness, and communicate collective resolve to deter
adversaries.

The Coast Guard should also collaborate with commercial companies to
expedite the design and construction of additional icebreakers. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office found that delays in the Polar Security
Cutter program were caused by beginning construction before the design
was completed. Partnering with the private sector could streamline the
process and accelerate production. While the U.S. ordered its first
commercial icebreaker last month, more are needed to close the
icebreaker gap. Alaska's congressional delegation secured \$125 million
in funding for this purchase, but broader congressional support is
essential to meet the full scope of Arctic security needs.

[Polar ice may diminish, but tension over the Arctic will only increase
as its strategic value grows]{.underline}. On September 10, 2024, Russia
and China began a massive week-long \"Ocean-24\" joint naval exercise
covering the Arctic Ocean, indicating that their growing alignment may
extend to Arctic interests. Similarly, [Russian military aircraft have
been more frequently spotted in Alaska's Air Defense Identification
Zone]{.underline}, including three times in the last week. If the U.S.
fails to make necessary adjustments, it risks losing its foothold in the
Arctic and falling further behind Russia and China's increasing military
presence. [A reinvigorated **icebreaker procurement program** and
partnerships with allies are indispensable to closing the **polar
icebreaker** **gap** to **deter American adversaries** **before** it\'s
**too late**.]{.underline}

#### Failure to counter Russian icebreaking allows them to [militarize]{.underline} and [control]{.underline} the region.

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [**Failing** to **establish** a surface presence in the
Arctic with icebreakers could yield an "**asymmetric equalizer**" for
**adversaries**,]{.underline} [a risk that becomes **more imminent** as
**polar ice melts** and access to the **Arctic increases**.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, "the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it, however serendipitously." [**Russia** and **China**
are actively moving the Great Power Competition to the
Arctic]{.underline}: [**Russia** is arming its icebreakers with
**anti-ship weapons** and **cruise missiles**]{.underline}, [both
nations are regularly patrolling the **Arctic** seas **with
icebreakers**]{.underline}, [and heavily investing in **nuclear
technology** for these **vessels**]{.underline}. While icebreakers are
certainly necessary for the Coast Guard's missions---including search
and rescue, navigation, environmental protection, interdiction, and ice
operations---[**Russia and China** have **embraced icebreakers** as
dual-use assets that **squarely address** the **Navy's
purpose**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the Navy and Air Force's existing
**submarine** and **aircraft presence** in the Arctic is inadequate for
the Great Power Competition]{.underline}. [Submarines and aircraft alone
cannot]{.underline} "clear a path for critical shipping, respond to oil
spills, or conduct maritime safety and security boardings in the U.S.
Arctic"---let alone [accomplish more **strategic goals** of **sea
control** and **power projection** in the region.]{.underline}

[Continued investments in **Arctic-specific**]{.underline} hardware and
[**equipment** are **paramount** for **successfully deterring Russia's
contestation efforts** and Chinese regional
**encroachments**]{.underline}. More than ever, Arctic capabilities must
respond to specific missions.

[NATO and allies must define what **capabilities** they **will require
to operate** in the **region**.]{.underline} As noted above, across the
NATO 7 nations critical capabilities gaps abound, in cold weather
hardware, ice-strengthened assets, ice-capable ships with anti-aircraft
and anti-submarine capabilities,129 infrastructure suited for effective
early warning threat detection systems and air defense,130 radar
coverage and aerial domain awareness, subsea sensing, and Arctic-related
logistics and resupplies, among others.

An essential part of the US DoD Arctic strategy's "monitor-and-respond"
approach is to enhance US Arctic capabilities in critical areas such as
domain awareness and dedicated cold weather equipment.50 [Yet the US and
the Arctic 7 as a whole have a low **starting point** in terms of cold
weather and **ice-strengthened capabilities.**]{.underline}

[Regarding **conventional capabilities**]{.underline}, [the current
**environment** has **shown the need** to increase **physical access**
and **presence** in the **region thanks to icebreakers.**]{.underline}
[Recognizing that it will not close the "icebreaker gap" on its own, the
US recently]{.underline} [unveiled]{.underline} a trilateral partnership
with Canada and Finland called [the]{.underline} Icebreaker
Collaboration Effort, or **[ICE Pact]{.underline}**.131 The ICE Pact
will help build polar icebreakers and other surface assets in the logic
of burden sharing and comparative advantages --- although it heavily
leans on ensuring job security and retaining skills in US shipyards.

[The downturn in relations between the West and Russia]{.underline} in
recent years, which some describe as a new Cold War (Legvold, 2016),
[has led to]{.underline} **[renewed concern]{.underline}** [about the
possibility of major war]{.underline} in Europe. Since the conflict over
Ukraine in 2014, most of the institutional ties between the West and
Russia that were put in place in the 1990s and 2000s have been frozen or
abandoned, the United States and the European Union (EU) have imposed
financial and other sanctions on Russia, and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Russia have intensified military deployments and
planning for a possible war with one another. [Russian and Western
military activities have resulted in a significant increase in close
military encounters]{.underline} in the air and at sea, which analysts
fear could trigger an unintended conflict (Frear et al., 2014; Raynova
and Kulesa, 2018). Some observers have warned of scenarios involving war
between Russia and NATO which could escalate to the use of nuclear
weapons (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2016; Shirreff, 2016).
[Drawing on the **growing literature**]{.underline} [on the conditions
of peace between states]{.underline}, as well as Gaddis' Cold War long
peace thesis (Gaddis, 1986, 1991), [this article assesses the prospects
for war and peace]{.underline} between Russia and the West in Europe in
the 2020s and beyond. The first section of the article reviews the
literature on the sources of peace between states, identifying those
factors most relevant to contemporary Western-Russian relations in
Europe. The next section shows how the contested nature of Europe's
post-Cold War order has created an enduring source of tensions and
potential conflict between the West and Russia. The following sections
examine three factors that I argue make [war between the West and Russia
in Europe unlikely:]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[contemporary
European balance of power]{.underline}**, [which is best characterised
as]{.underline} [modified bipolarity]{.underline} and [has]{.underline}
important **[stabilising consequences]{.underline}**; [the
continuing]{.underline} **[pacifying impact]{.underline}** [of nuclear
weapons; and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[energy
relationship]{.underline}** [between Russia and the West,
which]{.underline} [is best understood as one of
**interdependence**]{.underline} (rather than simple Western dependence
on Russia). Combined with two things that have not changed --
[the]{.underline} **[deterrent impact]{.underline}** [of the
likely]{.underline} [consequences of **any extended conventional
war**]{.underline} [and the **reduced risk**]{.underline} [of surprise
or pre-emptive attack arising from the development of **reconnaissance
satellites**]{.underline} -- [these factors are **significant forces**
likely to **impose caution** on Russian and Western leaders and thus act
as]{.underline} [important]{.underline} **[bulwarks against the
risk]{.underline}** [of war between Russia and the West.]{.underline}
This article also examines Western and Russian behaviour in crises
involving the use of force since the end of the Cold War, showing that,
[**despite** divergent positions]{.underline} [and resulting
tensions]{.underline}, [there have also been]{.underline} **[important
elements of restraint]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[mutual
communication]{.underline}** [by both the West and Russia in such
crises]{.underline} -- [suggesting that both sides are **aware of the
risks**]{.underline} [of escalation and have **taken steps to avoid
war**]{.underline}. The possibility of war between Russia and the West
in Europe should not be entirely discounted and governments should work
to maintain channels of communication and establish confidence-building
measures (European Leadership Network, 2020). Nonetheless, [despite the
serious downturn in Russo-Western relations]{.underline} in recent
years, [one can be]{.underline} cautiously **[optimistic]{.underline}**
[that the long peace between Russia and the West in Europe **will
continue.**]{.underline}

"[The likelihood of Russia choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin choosing --
[to use nuclear weapons directly against the West is **astronomically
low**. **It should not even be seriously considered at this stage**,"
says Katherine Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent
Institute for the Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously
tracked Russia's military movements since it first invaded Ukraine.
"[Putin would love it if Western leaders believed that he might. He is
many things, but **he is not suicidal**]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She
adds that Putin ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly
given the current state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a
conventional war in Ukraine]{.underline}." [Putin's references to
potential nuclear war serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's
limited economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's a
tactic the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline} since first
invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the former core
of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power." The method
has worked to some degree, most visibly by [[isolating Germany from its
traditional ironclad allies in the
West]{.underline}](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-09-13/ukraine-chides-germany-for-inaction-as-it-routs-russian-forces)
due to Berlin's protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid
to Ukraine's military. And it has effectively raised concern among
experts who specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be
dangerous to assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says
Jon Wolfsthal, a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group
Global Zero and a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which
annually publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of
nuclear war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United
States Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in
deterrence does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the
lessons of history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is
fragile and can fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on
Putin grow, the concern is that he will not think clearly or may put
more emphasis on survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on
alliances or friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to [[90
seconds to
midnight]{.underline}](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-01-24/doomsday-clock-moves-to-90-seconds-to-midnight-as-nuclear-threat-rises)
in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical annihilation,
than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear war from
Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease and climate
volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds that the
primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia -- chiefly
economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin takes
seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war crimes and
is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with a number
of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says. "If there
is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's possible use
of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not been visibly
communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates." Others believe
that [Putin's most ferocious nuclear rhetoric]{.underline} mostly
[exposes the extent to which the embattled Russian leader feels
**desperate** for new sources of **leverage**]{.underline}. They suggest
that leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden
announcement that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START
treaty, the last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and
Russia. "What [this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says
John Erath, a former top National Security Council official for European
affairs, now senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, Russia's
other sources of influence are **rapidly dwindling**]{.underline} or,
more surprisingly, are now exposed as ineffectual. European countries
that previously relied heavily on flows of Russian energy --
particularly natural gas -- have defied expectations and survived winter
so far without supplies from Moscow. The [[endemic rot of
corruption]{.underline}](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-08-31/how-russian-corruption-is-foiling-putins-army-in-ukraine)
within its Ministry of Defense has become widely exposed. Its
conventional military has suffered a string of [[embarrassing defeats on
the
battlefield]{.underline}](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/putin-forced-to-address-embarrassing-failures-in-russias-conscription-process),
including during [[the beginning of an ongoing
offensive]{.underline}](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2023-02-16/russian-offensive-in-ukraine-begins-with-series-of-failures)
that Russia believed would shift momentum in its favor. The Institute
for the Study of War, like several other private intelligence firms,
believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more as an information
operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's partners in Europe
from providing additional military aid that could be considered
escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated tanks. He has
had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy to provide
Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to remain off the
table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly zone, which
Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit Russia's
ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from the skies.
And while American officials publicly say the course of the war is up to
the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the suggestion that
Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Russia in
2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of providing
weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What Putin also has
in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of some key figures
in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed their perspective
on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent years. With Moscow
once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and more recently
viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an empire by force
at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of Trump finds itself
with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army engaged in a ground
war and being routed by a foreign army without the loss of a single
American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of the commitment.
What that means in the course of a presidential campaign that
prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, [[where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons
use]{.underline}](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-06-27/pentagon-blasts-putins-cavalier-nuclear-saber-rattling-as-russia-seeks-new-advantages-in-ukraine).
[Within Russia, the **war is not popular**]{.underline}, though polling
suggests Putin has not yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary
Russians. Still, [reports emerge regularly about the lack of confidence
Russian troops have in their leaders up the chain of
command]{.underline} -- leading some analysts to even speculate whether
generals charged with executing nuclear launch orders would [[comply
with their
directives]{.underline}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-putin-orders-a-nuke-will-his-generals-obey/2022/10/19/b5ecd7f4-4f6b-11ed-ada8-04e6e6bf8b19_story.html).
[Using nuclear weapons also **wouldn't achieve Putin's battlefield
aims**. Russian military doctrine calls for the use of low-yield nuclear
warheads as a last-ditch tactic]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
Russian forces are **utterly degraded**, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then factor in NATO retaliation for violating the nuclear
taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile strikes on
Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage facilities within
Ukraine," she says. "[You've just **lost** the operational advantage you
might have gained by using low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} --
even if you use 10 or 15." This scenario, however, exists within Russian
offensive operations. Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if
Russia feels it is squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent
"all-out disaster." "[You have to think about the human response to
nuclear use]{.underline}," she says, describing the effect on a
Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a rising mushroom cloud several miles
away toward the front lines. "[The symbolism is really important in that
the Russians may assume it would have a devastating effect on the
morale]{.underline} of the surviving Ukrainian forces," Lawlor says.
["At this stage in the war, though, it's not even under consideration
because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations]{.underline}." At least some of those who have engaged with
Putin directly agree. Former Prime Minister [Boris Johnson]{.underline}
revealed earlier this month that he had received direct warnings from
Putin of nuclear war. "He threatened me at one point, and he said,
\'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only
take a minute,\' or something like that. Jolly," the conservative
politician [[told]{.underline}](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64397745)
the BBC. [Johnson]{.underline} later explained to Fox News that he
believed that what Putin was "trying to do was creep me out ... trying
to reduce it to a story about a nuclear standoff between Russia and
NATO." He [argued that **Putin understands** the **devastating effect**
on **Russia** if it were to launch nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
