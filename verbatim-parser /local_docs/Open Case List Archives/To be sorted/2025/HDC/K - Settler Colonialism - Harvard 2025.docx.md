#### The current [Hobbesian]{.underline} international order is fundamentally structured by [racial capitalism]{.underline} and [colonialism]{.underline}, producing a global system where [state-sanctioned violence disproportionately targets]{.underline} Black and [marginalized]{.underline} bodies under the [guise]{.underline} of security. Structural racism is [not]{.underline} an [anomaly]{.underline} but a [foundational]{.underline} feature of the global political order.

INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we look at the relationship of race and
security1. [Contrary to normative assumptions in the field of politics
of a Hobbesian world order]{.underline} with a political subject who
possesses determinacy and **[will we argue a global racial
contract]{.underline}** -- [contingent on economic, social, juridical,
and physical violence --]{.underline} **[sets out to improve nature and
humanity.]{.underline}** **[[Colonialism and global racial capitalism
co-constitute]{.mark} an [environment]{.mark} for all kinds [of
violence: racial violence, wars and coups, police violence, economic and
structural inequities, and climate change effects]{.mark} with some
suffering more than others]{.underline}**. **[In fact, [structural
racism is foundational and generative of the international
order.]{.mark}]{.underline}** EXPLORE: THE LICIT LIFE OF RACISM AND
IN/SECURITY [One of the key scholars of international politics, [Thomas
Hobbes, argues]{.mark} that [one's right to self-preservation requires
the formation of the state, and the state's primary goal, or its social
compact, is the security of life.]{.mark}]{.underline} The basic purpose
of the social compact is to neutralize the bellum omnium contra omnia
(the war of all against all) to establish peace. Through the social
compact, our lives are protected against violent death, the bellum
omnium contra omnia. Yet the state can threaten life anytime, as it also
has a right to kill. In fact, the Hobbesian experiment sets a horizon
within which the sovereign has the right both to let live and to take
life. We don't suggest that Hobbes' two main works De Cive (1642) and
Leviathan (1651) are manifestly colonial or informed by racist contexts
(Blau 2023), but we do want to emphasize the specifically colonial
status of the state whose ostensible primary goal is the security of
life. In Leviathan, Hobbes writes: For as amongst masterless men there
is perpetuall war, of every man against his neigbour; no inheritance, to
transmit to the Son, nor to expect from the Father; no propriety of
Goods, or Lands; no security; but a full and absolute Libertie in every
Particular man: So in States, and Common-wealths not dependent on one
another, every Common-wealth (not every man) has an absolute Libertie,
to do what it shall judge (that is to say, what that Man, or Assemblie
that representeth it, shall judge) most conducing to their benefit. But
withal, they live in the condition of a perpetuall war, and upon the
confines of battle, with their frontiers armed, and canons planted
against their neigbours. (Leviathan 2.21.110) Citing this 1651 text,
Mary Nyquist provides a crucial analysis of how Hobbes deploys a
discourse that argues radicals in England confuse "individual personal
freedom" with "individual political freedom[." He refuses to acknowledge
the "collective political liberty asserted by anti-tyranny discourse" by
focusing "programmatically on the individual" to authorize his
experimental thought with the idea that "masterless men ... are natural
servi in need of being ruled"]{.underline} (Nyquist 2013: 281).
**[Hobbes does not explicitly advocate colonial expansion, but he
deploys Euro-colonialist assumptions.]{.underline}** Against the already
existing discourse of radicalism's notion of liberty, Nyquist says he
argues for revisioning "resistance's theory's contractualism so as to
make sovereignty by institution a creative act of communal
self-fashioning and the sovereign representative an artificial
construct" (Nyquist 2013: 281). Hobbes writes: For the savage people in
many places of America, except the government of small Families, the
concord whereof dependenth on natural lust, have no government at all;
and live at this day in that brutish manner, as I said before.
Howsoever, it may be perceived what manner of life there would be, where
there was no common Power to feare; by the manner of life, which men
that have formerly lived under a peacefull government, use to degenerate
into, in a civill Warre. (Leviathan 1.13.62) [Thomas Hobbes' deployment
of]{.underline} this thought experiment becomes crystallized through his
"instantiation" of [America.]{.underline} While deploying this as an
experimental strategy Thomas Hobbes "awake\[s\] and [mobilises fear of
loss in his readers by suggesting that civilized nations could at any
point "degenerate into" wars. Hobbes mobilizes notions like brutality
and the civil war to "disparage Americans or Africans"]{.underline}
(Nyquist 2013: 282--283). By "omitting geographical or historical
specificity," Hobbes can represent the "conditions as essentially
generic, potentially applying equally to all humans at any and all
times" (Nyquist 2013: 283). Drawing on the discourse of "savagery" which
developed in response to the resistance and struggles of Amerindians
against the English and French conquest, he can transmute evaluative
discourses into a universal condition by arguing that the "privative
age" is a condition of the past of the English to which even the most
civilized societies can find themselves regressing (Nyquist 2013: 284).
**[Hobbes and academics of International Relations who accept his
rhetorical strategies]{.underline}** [without paying close attention to
his translation of the Greek texts (in his "Life of Thucydides"), for
instance, are attempting both intellectually and materially to **erase
the ways his rhetoric and experiments of thought are inscribed with
violence that underwrite the sovereign state**]{.underline}. More so,
they avoid making explicit that Hobbes himself was experimenting with
thought to devise strategies and models of politics that could respond
to the queries of his own time and his own society (Topete 2023),
specifically his desire to support monarchy over the republic. In his
writings of the Greeks, he translates an empirical history into
something that ends up becoming a normative doctrine of colonialism and
imperialism. This humanist, Thomas Hobbes, ends up forcefully turning
into a pithy and deadly interlocutor of the reader of international
politics. **[His thought experiment turns into a grave
power.]{.underline}** He writes that the sovereign is permitted to
satisfy its insatiable desires for more power. In his words, And by
consequence, such augmentation of dominion over men, being necessary to
a man's conservation, it ought to be allowed him...We may further add
the insatiable appetite, or bulimia, of enlarging dominion, with the
incurable wounds thereby many times received from the enemy; and the
wens, of ununited conquests, which are many times a burden, and with
less danger lost than kept; as also the lethargy of ease, and
consumption of riot and vain expense (Hobbes 1969: 184--185, 218).
**[Imperial conquest is a justification for
self-preservation.]{.underline}** [Hobbes is not then documenting
history but rather translating texts to redress the conflicts and
contradictions between antiquarianism and context.]{.underline} **[He
is]{.underline}** indeed, as Leibniz says, **[an "unfaithful"
historian]{.underline}**. His translation is one which is **[guided by a
"national feeling"]{.underline}** (Leibniz 1988: 174, 168--169) without
being able to explain to himself how to understand the texts he
translated "setting \[them\] in their own times," and informs the reader
how they are being made "relevant to his own day" (Grafton 2007: 208).
**[The idea of a universalizing condition was endorsed by England's
merchant and elite classes whose involvement with the "Atlantic
plantocracy" required material resources, including new ideas or
ideologies, to support England's accelerating involvement in the slave
trade and plantation slavery.]{.underline}** This was a crucial
development that transmuted local politics and ultimately enabled the
global connection of the world (Mies 1986, Stavrianos 1981). Noel
Malcolm notes that Hobbes held land in Virginia through Lord Cavendish,
and he was responsible for the Virginia Company and the Somers Isles
Company which founded Bermuda in 1612 (Malcom 1981: 297--321). [**We
argue that it is imperative to grapple with this model of sovereignty,
of organizing and ordering life, this social compact that takes the
world's conditions to be universal and all to be equal, simply because
it is not an historical anomaly but an ongoing phenomenon. This model is
inscribed with structural racism. The Black Lives Matter movement
problematizes this model**, this mode whose primary goal is colonial
expansion in the name of self-preservation, this permission to directly
kill and murder, that has become normal within neoliberal
governmentality. By pointing to the practice of everyday murdering of
Black bodies, the Black Lives Matter speaks to this global/universalized
notion of security, this popularized discourse, demanding of us to
centralize its premises and take them to their logical
conclusion.]{.underline} [On 29 August 2005, as the brute force of
**Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast,** the guards of Templeman
III jail fled the facility, **leaving almost 600 prisoners locked in as
floodwaters rose**]{.underline}. The prisoners waited four days, and
water reached chest level before they were evacuated. According to a
Human Rights Watch investigation, the prisoners had no food or water;
they had one meal between 27 August and 1 September when they were
evacuated. The generators died, and the toilets backed up, leaving them
without lights or air circulation as the smell of human waste mounted.
Dan Bright, a prisoner at the facility, said that the guards "left us to
die there." Signs reading "Help Us," and "One Man Down" hung from the
third-floor windows of the jail (Agathangelou 2009). The Human Rights
Watch report said: "Inmates broke jail windows to let air in. They also
set fire to blankets and shirts and hung them out of the windows to let
people know they were still in the facility. At least a dozen inmates
jumped out of the windows" (Bassichis and Spade 2014; Human Rights Watch
2005[). The Sheriff's office claimed, "nobody drowned, nobody was left
behind," but this was inaccurate. At least 130 prisoners had not been
found when the Sheriff said this (Agathangelou 2009). **What kind of
security are we talking about when bodies (mostly Black) are abandoned
and exposed to premature (living) death? With what kinds of grammars
must bodies be inscribed such that they are not deemed bodies of
security but rather expendable flesh (Agathangelou 2009; Agathangelou et
al. 2008; Bassichis 2007)?**]{.underline} In a speech, President Bush
talked about his "tour" of New Orleans after the hurricane and flood: I
have just completed a tour of some devastated country. I started in
Alabama, and worked our way down through Mississippi, and ended up here
in one of America's great cities and saw first-hand the devastation that
this city has gone through. I know the people of this part of the world
are suffering, and I want them to know that there's a flow of progress.
We're making progress. Yet Black bodies drowned. Black bodies were left
to the consequences of the "flow of progress." Black bodies were not
provided the security of the social compact. One wonders: on what
grounds does such a universalized compact leave behind so many to die?
In a pre-civil state, the commodified slave shares with animals (per
Hobbes) the pre-civil condition of war (i.e., a set of a priori norms).
The slave must await his master to provide the security that every other
person is privy to naturally. Hobbes writes: \[The\] Servare, to Save
... is not meant a Captive, which is kept in prison, or bonds, till the
owner of him that took him, or bought him of one that did, shall
consider what to do with him: (for such men, commonly called Slaves)
have no obligation at all ... And then only is his life in security, and
his service due, when the Victor hath trusted him with his corporall
liberty. For Slaves that work in Prisons, or Fetters, do it not of duty,
but to avoid the Cruelty of their taskmasters. (Leviathan 2.20.103,
2.20.104) In turning the state into a body, the body politic, Hobbes is
assuming it to possess passions and interests which themselves are
endowed with normative qualities (Koskenniemi 2005: 79--83). It is
constituted by a set of aggregate self-preserving wills (individuals),
with determinacy and obligation/s that can decide the fate of the slave.
This kind of logic is engendered through the modern social compact. It
informs and shapes responses to those who are still considered to be
slaves, those "who work in Prisons, or Fetters" and who do service so to
avoid the "Cruelty of their taskmasters" (Hobbes 2.20.104). **[The
master's will (read the white subject) in the modern contract seems to
function as the origin of the individual and race.]{.underline}** [On 26
February 2012, in Sanford, Florida, George Zimmerman shot and killed
Trayvon Martin, a Black 17-year-old. While the original charge brought
against Zimmerman (who identified as Hispanic) was second-degree murder,
the judge gave the jury the option of convicting him on the lesser
charge of manslaughter (Lee 2013). This provision made it difficult to
find Zimmerman guilty as the jury had to find that Zimmerman caused
Martin's death purposefully and did not kill him based on self-defense.
The question of self-defense is linked to Florida's law,
"stand-your-ground," which permits the use of deadly force to defend
oneself against a perceived threat. On 13 July 2013, after more than 16
hours of deliberation, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty (Linder
2014).]{.underline} Martin's death intensified the debate on the
persistence of structural racism in the United States, in particular the
surveillance of Black bodies and racial profiling. President Barack
Obama expressed his dismay at the shooting, saying, "If I had a son,
he'd look like Trayvon," and he compared his younger self to Martin,
emphasizing racial profiling is a daily reality for African Americans. A
social media movement with the hashtag "Black Lives Matter" was
conceived in response to Zimmerman's acquittal. In addition to
highlighting the ongoing racism in the US, Black Lives Matter tries to
impede the recurrent nature of police violence in Black communities
(Maharawal 2017). **[Black Lives Matter argues the body politic does not
provide the security and protection promised by the state; instead, the
state is treating African Americans as a thing of "non-origin of
identity and race"]{.underline}** (Mohanram 1999: 28) **[as if they were
in a state of nature (i.e., uncivilized, outside the
compact).]{.underline}** Black Lives Matter highlights how white
supremacy has operated with a lack of constraint in its treatment of
Black bodies, pointing to the roots of this ongoing treatment in the
early system of slavery. [The brutal system of slavery commodified and
reduced Africans to property. Slavery produced Black bodies and gave
white masters control over them. In this social construction, called a
"state of nature" by Hobbes, nothing can be unjust.]{.underline} The
Black Lives Matter movement speaks out against white supremacy and its
ongoing racist systemic violence. For them, **[racism]{.underline}**, as
Ruth Gilmore defines it, **[is "the state-sanctioned and/or extralegal
production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to
premature death"]{.underline}** (2007: 247). **[Scholars, activists,
pundits, and policymakers interpret these forms of violence as either
individual or isolated events -- but this is simply not the
case.]{.underline}** These demands have resonated worldwide, as
structural racism goes beyond America. Structural racism engenders the
global racial capitalist structure. Black communities have mobilized
against global structural racism and insecurity in the form of terror of
Black communities, highlighting what is at stake in conversations about
security contestations and security struggles. [Chapters of Black Lives
Matter are found in Europe, Africa, and Asia.]{.underline} Image 15.2

struggles of Black Lives Matter and other movements, such as the
Indigenous movements in Latin America, Canada, Australia, and the United
States, colonialism and global racism are directly connected. For them,
the global system of life and the international order and its contingent
laws are the promised "ultimate domain of security]{.underline}**"
(Masco 2010: 9[). State security sculpts itself in the form of
evictions, "homeless removal," the criminalization of Black bodies and
the poor, and the privatization of public spaces by intensifying
security and policing practices that secure urban spaces for capital
investment and gentrification (Maharawal 2017: 343). However, few
analysts have focused on the connection between bodies, security,
sovereignty, and race. **International Relations scholars have pushed
for more explicit conversations about these connections**]{.underline}
(Agathangelou 2004; Behera et al. 2021; Chandler and Chipato 2021;
Chowdhry and Ling, 2010; Chowdry and Nair 2002; Chowdhry and Rai 2009;
Doty 1993; Grovogui 2001; Manchanda 2021; Sabaratnam 2020). **[Race and
sovereignty (i.e., security) are mutually constitutive, as the exercise
of sovereignty serves to co-constitute global racial hierarchies and the
international order]{.underline}**. [**Colonialism and systemic racism
have figured in shaping how global existential crises are understood in
different parts of the world.** As Achille Mbembe and Libby Meitjes
write: "Race has been the ever-present shadow in Western political
thought and practice, especially when it comes to imagining the
inhumanity of, or rule over, foreign peoples"]{.underline} (Mbembe and
Meitjes 2003: 17). **[It is, in other words, not just impossible but
also disingenuous to attempt to adequately theorize a form of
life-as-security when not all lives are considered as lives or as
deserving of security]{.underline}** [whereas some lives are sacrificed
for others and for the securing of a certain international
order.]{.underline} Both Hurricane Katrina and the Black Lives Matter
have brought to the fore that the social compact is not universal as
claimed. In fact, it is already racialized, and its racialization allows
viewing certain people as merely matter and collateral; their deaths are
superfluous and incidental to a grand experiment of global proportions,
but their lives as colonized subjects were/are never secure to begin
with. Police "security" operates hierarchically in its prioritization of
certain fields, actors, and states over others (Heath 2022: 292). Or as
many activists of Black Lives Matter, specifically the Bay Area
Anti-Police Terror Project, have said: "Police are the shock troops for
gentrification" (cited in Maharawal 2017: 340). [Thus, following them,
we wonder about the ways the liberal international order uses military
and police violence.]{.underline} How can we understand this violence
and beyond Hobbes' punctuated imaginary and through the vantage point of
those Black lives whose everyday experience exceeds the force of the
state to become a condition and state of being often produced at the
scale of the body, and with deadly consequences? [How can we hear the
cries of our brothers and sisters, their utterances that they cannot
breathe?]{.underline} Below, we engage with some of these questions by
focusing on the entanglements of race with domestic and international
security policies in the form of police violence, war, and climate
change. UNDERSTAND: "WHAT IS GOING ON?":2 WHITENESS AS PROPERTY, WAR,
AND CLIMATE CHANGE **[We are at a turning point. Political, financial,
and climate change and Anthropogenic activities are damaging the planet
to the point where the "ability of the planet's ecosystem to sustain
future generations can no longer be taken for granted"]{.underline}**
(Connor 2005). The planet's decimation is intensifying, and global
justice remains in the distance. Violence of all forms, from financial
debt to theft of life resources, is found everywhere. What can be done?
**[Inflation, food insecurity, the energy crisis, rising pressure on
global supply chains, geopolitical competition, and the breaking down of
national/international security are creating what some have called
"permacrisis"]{.underline}** (Turnbull 2022). **[These problems (what we
call forms of violence manifested in planetary ways) are impacting
household living conditions, and more people are going into the streets
and protesting (Maharawal 2017). In addition, the war in Ukraine, the
multiple coups in Africa, the more recent Hamas attack on Israel, and
Israel's military interventions to eradicate Hamas have brought home
that the more risks are associated with geostrategic confrontations, the
less able conventional collective security frameworks are to respond.
Invasions and coups are fueled by the long-term and adverse political,
economic, and social situation; they are guided by "neo-sovereigntist
militaries" (Soko et al. 2023) and informed by
colonialism]{.underline}**. [For example, Niger, like many African
nations, has long grappled with colonialism]{.underline}. Niger gained
its independence from France in 1960 after 60 years of French rule. A
lasting impact of that governance has been the centralization of power
in the hands of a few Nigerian elites (Zambarki, 2021). In addition,
[France]{.underline} drew extensively on local chiefs to ensure its
colonial administration and it [exploited and extracted revenues from
uranium mining]{.underline}. [The result: economic inequality and
limited diversification within a rickety economy, leaving many Nigeriens
marginalized and discontented. The recent military coup can be seen as a
reaction to this economic imbalance and a desire for greater control
over the country's resources. Similarly, the October 2023 Hamas attacks
on Israel and Israel's military interventions in Gaza to eradicate Hamas
are decisive because they are accelerating the erosion of the post-1945
order]{.underline}. Many of those arrangements are being contested and
violated as if the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) can be
followed or ignored at will. Siba Grovogui (2022) argues that the UDHR
was always a conversation about "what it means to be human, what it
takes to protect the human, and what it means to ennoble human
existence." In this sense, race is at the forefront and challenges an
easy reading of this and other agreements as being about the individual
of the social contract (Grovogui 2022). Thus, as Grovogui argues,
**[these arrangements cannot be read only through a Western lens or
narrowly punctuated to serve the interests of certain
powers]{.underline}** (Grovogui 2022). **[These permacrises have
enormous dimensions. New processes and demands for planetary
arrangements are indeterminate. The uncertainty which is emerging as a
kind of a new normal demands the invention of a collective response. To
sum up, colonialism is structurally integral to the establishment and
continuation of global political power and its
econom]{.underline}**y**[. Colonialism and its ordering depend on racial
regimes and racial distinctions woven into the evolution of imperial
politics and market economies. Race is thus inscribed in the social
contract and its legal form/s, institutions, such as international and
domestic law, the medical establishment, the education structure, the
prison system, the family, the market, treaties, and other international
agreements.]{.underline}**

#### Settler methods of developing/exploring land and ice are ontologically flattening, which give way to capitalist accumulation that results in violence towards indigenous life.

[I begin with land as analytic before turning to water and
ice]{.underline}. Land has been asked to hold multitudes across much
conceptual terrain. To show the fullness of ice and how it traffics
across analytical formations of land and water, I must acknowledge
critical genealogies and colonial trap- pings of land- based concepts
first. [The articulations of land that I explore crop up within and
against settler law, encroachment and occupation, and under the
technologies of measurement and surveillance. Those]{.underline}

discussed, especially in strategic formulations by Native peoples in the

need to visit with land as well as water.]{.underline} The aim is not
only to better understand ice but to think these relational elements and
their ongoing critical histories together toward possible coalition.

L A N D

**[Land animates core elements of Native politics, Native livelihoods,
Native histories, and Native futures]{.underline}**. "[**Land" functions
as a kind of shorthand for the many distinct historical, ontological,
and juridical relationships Native peoples,** communities, and polities
negotiate and maintain with beings, materialities, and landscapes that
are not human.]{.underline} Native authors, scholars, and thinkers have
long demonstrated how land operates as con- cept and material.1 **[As
Eve Tuck and Marcia McKenzie write, Indigenous theoretical and
conceptual formulations of land "derive from entirely dif- ferent
epistemological and cosmological foundations, and, thus, cannot be
easily combined or absorbed into Western argumentations.]{.underline}**
They come from, and go to, a different place." 2 Land is not only simple
measurable, observable ecological matter, though that is part of land
too.

[Land is central to Native communities, polities, and individuals in
ways that languages of coloniality, and often the academy, are not capa-
cious enough to reflect.]{.underline}3 **[The centrality of land did not
begin with, nor can it be usurped by, colonialism or colonial
actors.]{.underline}** As Joanne Barker puts it, "Indigenous land is not
capitalism's land," it is not "land as prop- erty within European and
North American legal philosophy and practice . . . \[or\] as an
inheritable patrilineal estate with intergenerational wealth and caste-
making properties . . . and cannot be equated or reduced to the property
of European and North American legal philosophy and prac- tice." 4
[While colonial agents and pressures continue to try to work Indig-
enous land into ahistorical property, this reduction and abstraction can
never be completed]{.underline}.

**[Instead, land is both context and process; it is the ground on which
and the context in which storytelling makes meaning of the
world]{.underline}**.5 Mish- uana Goeman describes land as "a meaning-
making place because that is at the heart of indigenous identity,
longing, and belonging. Indige- nous peoples make place by relating both
personal and communal expe- riences and histories to certain locations
and landscapes--- maintaining these spatial relationships is one of the
most important components of politics and our identity." 6 [If land is
central to Native communities across geographies, this shapes why land
is a central analytic in Native American and Indigenous studies
scholarship]{.underline}. **[The centrality of land to Native life is
also why colonial projects work to dispossess Native peoples of their
lands again and again through projects of ongoing
occupation.]{.underline}** The cen- tralization of land is iterative and
seemingly always urgent and neces- sary for Native peoples. As poet
Layli Long Soldier puts it, "I don't trust nobody / but the land." 7

This reality does not come without insistence that perhaps Native
studies scholarship has been overdetermined by a focus on land,8 as
might likewise be true of scholarship more broadly that is interested in
environmental questions. An overwhelming centralization of land then
comes to determine conceptually and theoretically the bounds of several
academic fields. [Scholars demonstrate how an overemphasis in the ter-
restrial and in grounded, fixed units of analysis have simplified the
sur- face of Earth as something planar and not volumetric.]{.underline}9
**[Technologies like mapping, land allotment, colonial borders, and
property rights are under girded by the imagined ability to measure land
definitively, to define and to separate one part of unmoving, static
earth from another.]{.underline}** The tools of land measurement are
compromised by their purported objectivity in documenting material in
its totality. Too often the theoretical tools of scholarship also make
space and place flat, passive, or geometric.10 **[Which, of course, is a
false oversimplification of land]{.underline}**.

[Land as flattened geometry is just one part of the issue. As Meredith
Palmer argues**, the metrics of measuring land are embroiled with**
histo- ries of anti- Indigenous racism in what she calls **"the racist
acre."**]{.underline} 11 **[Colo- nial and imperial tools and tactics of
measuring and observing land try to make it into inanimate materiality
for capitalist accumulation, sacri- fice, and often abandonment over and
against Indigenous relationships.]{.underline}**12 Max Liboiron,
following Sandra Styres and Dawn Zinga, has described that process as
one of making Land into land.13 In this formulation, [Land refers to
"the unique entity that is the combined living spirit of plants,
animals, air, water, humans, histories, and events recognized by many
Indigenous communities. When land is not capitalized \[land\] refers to
the concept from a colonial worldview whereby landscapes are common,
universal, and everywhere, even with great variation."]{.underline} 14
Capital L Land is relations; small l land is resource. Tuck and McKenzie
write correctly, then, that "Indigenous intellectual contributions
rarely fail to engage in issues of land and place--- especially via
conceptualizations of tribal identity, sovereignty, and treaty rights---
yet when these discussions are taken up by non- Indigenous and settler
scholars, the saliency of land and place is frequently left out of the
picture." 15 [Put another way, it is not simply a problem
that]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}** [is flattened into passive
static space through technology and narrative alike, but that
those]{.underline} [**flattenings** are also the]{.underline}
**[overlooking, undermining, and an attempted severing of Native sover-
eignties and relationships]{.underline}**. [Staying attentive to the
ways that land has been designated, measured, surveilled, and documented
through tech- nologies that are anti- Indigenous demonstrate the need by
Native think- ers to continue to describe and reclaim land
relationalities in scholarship and in practice.]{.underline}16

Enactments of colonialism also coerce Native peoples to regard, dis-
cuss, and interact with land in strategic formulations. Often, those
strat- egies are necessarily iterative, as colonialism is as historical
as it is a contemporary project, maintaining and making itself [**anew.
Native poli- ties, communities, and individuals have had to employ**
what Gayatri Spi- vak has called "**strategic essentialism" to keep
homelands under Native governance**.]{.underline}17 **[This is not
always how Native people may want to formu- late relationships to their
lands.]{.underline}** [Federal and state sponsored colonial projects are
often beyond the control and purview of Native peoples, communities, and
polities, such as allotment and property- making, iden- tity regimes of

**[These ongoing histories]{.underline}** [not only continue to shape

Arctic ice geographies are often negatively compared to more easily

sentiment to Watt- Cloutier, Leslie Marmon Silko writes in her essay
"Interior and Exterior Landscapes" about relation- ships to desert
places: Hopi Pueblo elders said that the austere and, to some eyes,
barren plains and hills surrounding their mesa- top villages in
northeast Arizona actually help nurture the spirituality of the Hopi way
. . . the Hopi people might have settled in locations far more lush. . .
. But there on the high, silent, sandstone mesas that overlook the
sandy, arid expanses stretching to all horizons, the Hopi elders say the
Hopi people must "live by their prayers." Great abundances of things . .

important.20 [For Silko the desert offers a relationship that supports
and enriches a spiritual relationship, most important above all in her
sensibility. **Across Silko and Watt- Cloutier, the landscapes of ice
and desert are crucially life- giving and sustaining. Many of the

map onto desert or ice, defying what settler law might try to make of it

[An ethic of incommensurability, which guides moves that **unsettle
innocence**, stands in contrast to aims of reconciliation, which
motivate settler moves to innocence. Reconciliation is about rescuing
settler normalcy, about rescuing a settler future]{.underline}.
Reconciliation is concerned with questions of [***what will
decolonization look like? What** will happen **after** abolition**?**
**What** will be* *the **consequences** of decolonization **for the
settler?*** Incommensurability acknowledges]{.underline} that these
[questions need not]{.underline}, and perhaps cannot, [be
answered]{.underline} in order for decolonization to exist as a
framework. We want to say, first, that [**decolonization** **is not
obliged to answer** those questions - **decolonization** is **not
accountable to settlers**, or settler futurity. Decolonization is
accountable to **Indigenous sovereignty** and futurity.]{.underline}
Still, we acknowledge the questions of those wary participants in Occupy
Oakland and other settlers who want to know what decolonization will
require of them. [The answers are not fully in view and can't be as long
as decolonization remains punctuated by metaphor. The **answers** will
not emerge from friendly understanding, and indeed **require** a
**dangerous understanding** of uncommonality that un-coalesces coalition
politics - moves that may feel very unfriendly. But we will find out the
answers as we get there, "in the exact measure that we can discern the
movements which give \[decolonization\] historical form and
content"]{.underline} (Fanon, 1963, p. 36). To fully enact an ethic of
incommensurability means relinquishing settler futurity, [**abandoning**
the **hope** that **settlers may** one day **be commensurable to
Native** peoples. It means removing the asterisks, periods, commas,
apostrophes, the whereas's, buts, and conditional clauses that punctuate
decolonization and underwrite settler innocence. The Native futures, the
lives to be lived once the settler nation is gone - these are the
**unwritten possibilities** made possible by an ethic of
incommensurability.]{.underline}

[I begin with land as analytic before turning to water and
ice]{.underline}. Land has been asked to hold multitudes across much
conceptual terrain. To show the fullness of ice and how it traffics
across analytical formations of land and water, I must acknowledge
critical genealogies and colonial trap- pings of land- based concepts
first. [The articulations of land that I explore crop up within and
against settler law, encroachment and occupation, and under the
technologies of measurement and surveillance. Those]{.underline}
**[colo- nial projects shape how ice can be understood, related to, and
discussed, especially in strategic formulations by Native peoples in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** [To sit with ice thoroughly and rigorously we
need to visit with land as well as water.]{.underline} The aim is not
only to better understand ice but to think these relational elements and
their ongoing critical histories together toward possible coalition.

L A N D

**[Land animates core elements of Native politics, Native livelihoods,
Native histories, and Native futures]{.underline}**. "[**Land" functions
as a kind of shorthand for the many distinct historical, ontological,
and juridical relationships Native peoples,** communities, and polities
negotiate and maintain with beings, materialities, and landscapes that
are not human.]{.underline} Native authors, scholars, and thinkers have
long demonstrated how land operates as con- cept and material.1 **[As
Eve Tuck and Marcia McKenzie write, Indigenous theoretical and
conceptual formulations of land "derive from entirely dif- ferent
epistemological and cosmological foundations, and, thus, cannot be
easily combined or absorbed into Western argumentations.]{.underline}**
They come from, and go to, a different place." 2 Land is not only simple
measurable, observable ecological matter, though that is part of land
too.

[Land is central to Native communities, polities, and individuals in
ways that languages of coloniality, and often the academy, are not capa-
cious enough to reflect.]{.underline}3 **[The centrality of land did not
begin with, nor can it be usurped by, colonialism or colonial
actors.]{.underline}** As Joanne Barker puts it, "Indigenous land is not
capitalism's land," it is not "land as prop- erty within European and
North American legal philosophy and practice . . . \[or\] as an
inheritable patrilineal estate with intergenerational wealth and caste-
making properties . . . and cannot be equated or reduced to the property
of European and North American legal philosophy and prac- tice." 4
[While colonial agents and pressures continue to try to work Indig-
enous land into ahistorical property, this reduction and abstraction can
never be completed]{.underline}.

**[Instead, land is both context and process; it is the ground on which
and the context in which storytelling makes meaning of the
world]{.underline}**.5 Mish- uana Goeman describes land as "a meaning-
making place because that is at the heart of indigenous identity,
longing, and belonging. Indige- nous peoples make place by relating both
personal and communal expe- riences and histories to certain locations
and landscapes--- maintaining these spatial relationships is one of the
most important components of politics and our identity." 6 [If land is
central to Native communities across geographies, this shapes why land
is a central analytic in Native American and Indigenous studies
scholarship]{.underline}. **[The centrality of land to Native life is
also why colonial projects work to dispossess Native peoples of their
lands again and again through projects of ongoing
occupation.]{.underline}** The cen- tralization of land is iterative and
seemingly always urgent and neces- sary for Native peoples. As poet
Layli Long Soldier puts it, "I don't trust nobody / but the land." 7

This reality does not come without insistence that perhaps Native
studies scholarship has been overdetermined by a focus on land,8 as
might likewise be true of scholarship more broadly that is interested in
environmental questions. An overwhelming centralization of land then
comes to determine conceptually and theoretically the bounds of several
academic fields. [Scholars demonstrate how an overemphasis in the ter-
restrial and in grounded, fixed units of analysis have simplified the
sur- face of Earth as something planar and not volumetric.]{.underline}9
**[Technologies like mapping, land allotment, colonial borders, and
property rights are under girded by the imagined ability to measure land
definitively, to define and to separate one part of unmoving, static
earth from another.]{.underline}** The tools of land measurement are
compromised by their purported objectivity in documenting material in
its totality. Too often the theoretical tools of scholarship also make
space and place flat, passive, or geometric.10 **[Which, of course, is a
false oversimplification of land]{.underline}**.

[Land as flattened geometry is just one part of the issue. As Meredith
Palmer argues**, the metrics of measuring land are embroiled with**
histo- ries of anti- Indigenous racism in what she calls **"the racist
acre."**]{.underline} 11 **[Colo- nial and imperial tools and tactics of
measuring and observing land try to make it into inanimate materiality
for capitalist accumulation, sacri- fice, and often abandonment over and
against Indigenous relationships.]{.underline}**12 Max Liboiron,
following Sandra Styres and Dawn Zinga, has described that process as
one of making Land into land.13 In this formulation, [Land refers to
"the unique entity that is the combined living spirit of plants,
animals, air, water, humans, histories, and events recognized by many
Indigenous communities. When land is not capitalized \[land\] refers to
the concept from a colonial worldview whereby landscapes are common,
universal, and everywhere, even with great variation."]{.underline} 14
Capital L Land is relations; small l land is resource. Tuck and McKenzie
write correctly, then, that "Indigenous intellectual contributions
rarely fail to engage in issues of land and place--- especially via
conceptualizations of tribal identity, sovereignty, and treaty rights---
yet when these discussions are taken up by non- Indigenous and settler
scholars, the saliency of land and place is frequently left out of the
picture." 15 [Put another way, it is not simply a problem
that]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}** [is flattened into passive
static space through technology and narrative alike, but that
those]{.underline} [**flattenings** are also the]{.underline}
**[overlooking, undermining, and an attempted severing of Native sover-
eignties and relationships]{.underline}**. [Staying attentive to the
ways that land has been designated, measured, surveilled, and documented
through tech- nologies that are anti- Indigenous demonstrate the need by
Native think- ers to continue to describe and reclaim land
relationalities in scholarship and in practice.]{.underline}16

Enactments of colonialism also coerce Native peoples to regard, dis-
cuss, and interact with land in strategic formulations. Often, those
strat- egies are necessarily iterative, as colonialism is as historical
as it is a contemporary project, maintaining and making itself [**anew.
Native poli- ties, communities, and individuals have had to employ**
what Gayatri Spi- vak has called "**strategic essentialism" to keep
homelands under Native governance**.]{.underline}17 **[This is not
always how Native people may want to formu- late relationships to their
lands.]{.underline}** [Federal and state sponsored colonial projects are
often beyond the control and purview of Native peoples, communities, and
polities, such as allotment and property- making, iden- tity regimes of
blood quantum calculations, removal and relocation from homelands, theft
of children and placement into boarding schools, pollu- tion, and
environmental racism**. These are all colonial land relations that most
often require(d) military force and simultaneous if not subsequen- tial
bureaucratic violences.**]{.underline} As Michelle Daigle has written,
"Theorizations of colonial conquest, resistance, and liberation require
interrogations of the fixed spatialities and temporalities that
Indigenous peoples continue to be relegated to discursively and

### Link -- Arctic Resources

#### The aff's attempt to use the Arctic as a "resource frontier" is a new wave of Settler Colonialism rooted in resource exploitation and colonial project

**Silva, a Brazilian researcher and PhD student at the Institute of
International Relations of the Pontifical, 22**

\[Pedro Allemand Mancebo, "The Old Colonialisms and the New Ones: The
Arctic Resource Boom as a New Wave of Settler-Colonialism", The Arctic
Institute,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/old-colonialisms-new-ones-arctic-resource-boom-new-wave-settler-colonialism/,
7/10/25 GDI - JH

Recently, [the Arctic began to be treated as a "geopolitical hotspot"
and as a "resource frontier]{.underline}." The region's international
(i.e., interstate) dynamics [has been drawing the attention
of]{.underline} scholars and policymakers seeking to make sense (and
take advantage) of [emerging geopolitical and economic phenomena in the
region]{.underline}. [One of the main drivers of such efforts is the
so-called Arctic resource boom]{.underline} -- an enhanced knowledge on
the resource endowment of Arctic seas and lands, especially in terms of
the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral reserves. Since the publication
of the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008, such knowledge of the
region has only increased, and [triggered a plethora of economic
development projects for the region -- most geared towards making the
commercial exploitation of such resources]{.underline} viable. Such
plans, [typical of **neo-extractivist modes of development and capital
accumulation**]{.underline},[1) demand new instruments]{.underline} and
technologies of control over land, territory and resources -- not only
in [enabling the resource exploitation, but also in displacing Arctic
Indigenous populations that inhabit spaces where resource-based economic
activity is meant to take place]{.underline}. This process has been
coupled with a range of practices aimed at controlling space and
mobilities in indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis calls "striation
activities". 2)

Theorizations and debates on the Arctic resource boom or on the
geopolitical tensions rising in the region are generally oblivious to
indigenous political projects, institutions and articulations in the
region. [This erasure takes the colonial violence underlying the
relation between Arctic States and Arctic indigenous peoples out of
sight, **obscuring the violent history of expropriation** underpinning
contemporary Arctic geopolitics and economic development]{.underline}.
Another effect of such perspectives is the presentation of the Arctic as
an "empty" space, devoid of people, social dynamics and politics other
than those developed and brought by Westphalian States.3) This position
[seeks to justify State interventions in the region for "properly"
seizing emerging economic and strategic opportunities -- with little to
no regard for indigenous cultures and subsistence in the
Arctic,]{.underline} nor to the already sensible effects of climate
change in the region.

[The present article seeks to frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a
**new wave of Arctic settler colonialism**]{.underline}. We argue that,
although [projects for resource exploitation of the Arctic are achieving
unprecedented scale, they represent a continuity of the colonial
project,]{.underline} benefitting from the way previous waves of
colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the relations
between Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories. Our
discussion is focused on [the impacts of colonialism over the Beringian
portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit homeland -- and the impacts of
colonialism over the relation between State, indigenous peoples and
Arctic spaces.]{.underline} Then we move on to a discussion of the
Arctic resource boom and the strategic and development projects emerging
in the Arctic policies of littoral states [and their treatment of
indigenous issues amid economic and strategic pressures to carve out new
extractixve enclaves in Arctic territories.]{.underline}

We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism, [seeking to
understand how the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American
populations and the importance of resource extraction shaped
contemporary Arctic spaces]{.underline} -- from baleen and whale oil to
the gold rush and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here
is to understand how [this first moment of colonialism set up the
conditions for modern-day resource development projects]{.underline}.
The discussion, then, turns to contemporary economic development
projects in the Arctic, understanding them as neo-extractivist
enterprises -- i.e., enterprises [that rely heavily on resource
development and control over space in a late capitalist globalized
economy]{.underline}. As such, these projects represent a geographical
expansion of extractive frontiers in a global scale, seeking new
resource reserves and to reshape space to make them commercially viable.
[This represents a new wave of colonialism -- i.e., of attempts by state
and capital to enhance control over traditional indigenous territories
-- and a new wave of threats and attempts at **dispossessing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples from their rights** to their traditional lands and
livelihoods]{.underline}.

Time as a fatal confusion? **[Environmentalist Bill McKibben suggests
'the time to freak out over climate change is now']{.underline}**
(2019). In earlier work, he argues one of the key problems with climate
change is a 'fatal confusion about the nature of time and space'
(McKibben, 2003, p. 7). This confusion, he contends, is a result of
Western society's distinctions between the time of culture and the time
of nature (McKibben, 2003, p. 7). McKibben argues against this Cartesian
fiction. [The melting of glaciers, mass extinc- tions, and the depletion
of resources are accelerating, but humans are reacting slowly (2003, p.
12]{.underline}). A leading strategist of the US climate change movement
who pushed 'the threat of climate change into the mainstream American
political agenda' (Nisbet, 2013, p. 41), [McKibben highlights the role
of 'time in managing the intertwined relationality of everyday life'
(Bastian, 2012, p. 25).]{.underline} [For him, the question of climate
change is one of coordination and synchronization.]{.underline}
Technologies like the clock (i.e. Coordinated Universal Time) used to
universally coordinate life (Bastian, 2012; McKibben, 2003) simply
'enable the status quo to continue unimpeded' (Bastian, 2012, p. 25;
citing McKibben, 2003). McKibben argues for a sense of coordination in
the battle for the future: 'It's a particular kind of fight \... A
battle for winning the sense of what's inevitable or not. What's the
world going to look like. And that battle is, well -- that's everything'
(McKibben, 2015). Distinguish- ing his vision for a new future for the
planet from the vision of the fossil-fuel industry, McKibben tells
climate activists to problematize the status quo: 'Creativity is the
absolute most important thing in this fight' (2015). In Deep Economy,
McKibben argues it is possible for enlightened consumers to build
sustainable economies through their everyday choices. The ecological
footprint and the solution to twenty- first-century problems, such as
climate change, can be redressed without having to give up demo- cratic
or progressive values. McKibben calls readers to act now by altering
their consumption pat- terns and voluntarily making the transition to a
viable future 'tolerable, even sweet, instead of tragic' (2007, p. 232).
In this book, he shows how people have been involving themselves in
small-scale projects by extracting themselves from the global economy.
Drawing on several local and collective projects from the Global South
he argues these experiments are promising paths of greener development,
steps that will prove crucial in the face of global warming. He suggests
such voluntary initiatives lead to the restoration of 'the reality of
what our world can provide' (2015, p. 4), given the earth's certain
absolute limits. McKibben's resolution of the exceptional emergency is
based on a linearly punctuated voluntar- ism. But this simple linear
coding conceals a complex series of questions about how just futures may
be engineered and by whom. Historical events are not equally distributed
along a linear axis. This bending of the climate linearity toward the
temporal imbalance misses how these moments appear as the events that
will restore the temporal order. McKibben's calls point to how time as a
fatal confusion is related to his understanding of what is to come.
**[In fact, time as a fatal confusion stretches thought about the
relationality of 'culture' and 'nature.']{.underline}** [Some have
sought to use clock time, or universal human time, to coordinate
action]{.underline}. One example is the Hundred Months clock developed
by the New Economics Foundation in 2008. [It counts how many months are
left for us to take action to avoid Earth's average surface temperature
rising more than 2°C. If nothing is done in this period, it will be too
late]{.underline}. Far from indicating empty homogeneous time, the clock
'tells us that everything that we do from now matters' (Bastian, 2012,
p. 39). The use of such clocks proposes 'a measure of the 'before' and
'after' to facilitate a communal reorientation' and mobilization for
action 'towards the dangerous changes currently taking place' (Bastian,
2012, p. 40). **[However, this attempt to figure out how to coordinate
ourselves may require not just 'radical refigurations of the
clock]{.underline}**' (Bastian, 2012, p. 40**[) but also an
understanding of how the arrangement of situations presumes a figurative
capacity of theoretical and historical writing hostile to certain
ecologies, knowledge, ideas, and those relegated to the margins of
colonial, enslav- ing, and racial imperial orders.]{.underline}** For
McKibben, **[this change is to be driven 'not by government fiat but by
local desire and neces- sity']{.underline}** (2007, p. 3). Local
initiatives seem to be the cure-all for the excesses of global
capitalism, yet he says, 'No one wants to do away with markets, or to
centrally plan economies' (2007, p. 225). To avoid temporal confusion,
he attacks 'growth,' 'the cult of More' (2007, p. 177), or 'the doctrine
of endless economic expansion' (2007, p. 24) but without explicitly
challenging or opening the 'eco- logical crisis' to questions of black,
indigenous, and postcolonial designs of thought and activism, as for
example, in [the work of Frantz Fanon, Kyle Whyte, Leanne Simpson, and
Romy Opperman (see also Black Ecologies) and Achille Mbembe to name a
few. These authors are not satisfied to use the notion of time as a
fatal confusion; rather, they take on time**. For them, the relationship
between racism/coloniality and ecological degradation cannot be
addressed or even transformed by focusing on crisis or
emergency.**]{.underline} They grapple with the ways we historicize and
analyse black, indigenous, and diasporic ecologies and examine how such
people are 'most susceptible to the effects of climate change, including
rising sea levels, subsidence, sinking land, as well as ongoing effects
of toxic stew- ardship' (Roane & Hosbey, 2019) because of the relations
of temporal orientations and the plane- tary racial imperial order:
'**[these same communities, \... have bearing on how we should
historicize the current crisis and how we conceive of futures outside of
destruction']{.underline}** (Roane & Hosbey, 2019). Romy Opperman argues
capitalism and white supremacist settler states are not interested in
the 'survival and the flourishing of racialized people, nor that of the
environments in which we live' (Opperman, 2020). For her, the desire to
return to 'normal' temporal orders is a business-as- usual political
imaginary, reaffirming that 'normal \[which\] means the plunder of the
earth's resources, the wars for these resources, not to mention the
practices that destroy, dehumanize, and oppress life in its myriad forms
on this earth' (Opperman, 2020). 'Alternative political imagin- aries-to
the state and capital,' she says, are more urgent than ever (Opperman,
2020). **[The naming of what we currently face as crisis or emergency
evades the ways radical black ecologies, that is, black thinkers,
movements, and communities and their insurgencies have been disavowed
in]{.underline}** GLOBALIZATIONS 825 826 A. M. AGATHANGELOU AND K. D.
KILLIAN **[accounts of what counts as history's long durée or
event.]{.underline}** Radical black ecologies 'have refused the ruse
that capitalism, the state, heteropatriarchy, and the domination of
more-than-human nature are the means and ends of justice and freedom'
(Opperman, 2020). **[For her, black ecologies open the relations of the
structure of time and racial capital regimes to question by crossing
colonial and enslaving historical boundaries and their contingent events
or by suspending them.]{.underline}** Françoise Vergès points to the
racialized nature of modern capitalism; she proposes an expan- sion of
Jason Moore's alternative periodizing of our current time as the
Capitalocene, what Moore calls 'the historical era shaped by the endless
accumulation of capital' (Moore, 2015b, p. 596), into an explicitly
'racial Capitalocene,' an epoch when the 'environment \[is\] shaped by
slavery and colo- nialism' (Vergès, 2017, p. 73). For her, this
methodology allows us to 'write a history of the environ- ment that
includes slavery, colonialism, imperialism, and racial capitalism, from
the standpoint of those who were \... fabricated as disposable people,
whose lives do not matter' (Vergès, 2017, p. 73). For her, it is
imperative that we contest colonialism and enslavement in a more general
description of their language of race. Vergès puts pressure on the idea
of 'ecological crisis' and broadens it to be an effect of a racial
planetary capital regime that depends on force and violence to transmute
and maintain the conditions of its existence. **[Such a 'crisis'
entangles slavery, colonialism, imperialism with the planetary and
racial capital- ism]{.underline}**. It is important to remember the
Cartesian production of reality: the division, hierarchization, and
sequencing of culture as value and nature as without value (da Silva,
2017). The Cartesian/ cogito subject is redeemed by time rather than
space (the 'dark' side of Western reason, progress, and the rational
subject). Human mastery of the social realm follows the mastery of
nature. Liber- ation from the two tyrannies -- nature and irrational
social authority -- is inevitable, as progress set in motion will
culminate in a final Tenth Epoch when 'social art' will triumph
(Condorcet, 1793). This world is buoyed up by linear history as the new
order of things, a history in which the West's advanced evolutionary
development reproduces the subject and the sovereign territorial state
as the telos of natural and historical development. In this
understanding, Europe traditionally asserted 'world' history as the
natural order of things, an evolutionary struggle of the fit against the
unfit, with Europe leading the pack. Michel Foucault argues a semblance
of European unity was shattered during the nineteenth cen- tury with the
destruction of 'natural' time and the concomitant birth of interest in
history: 'histories of everything emerged at the moment man was
'emptied' of history' (Foucault, 1973, pp. 367--370). Richard Terdiman
says the obsession with time in the nineteenth century was a 'crisis of
diachro- nicity' (1993, p. 15), an abyss opening between a past forever
destroyed and a present showing no clear way to the future. The late
twentieth century developed precisely when 'nature' and the 'nat-
uralizing' of space by Europeans faced 'a crisis of synchronicity'
(Terdiman, 1993, p. 15) in the return of the 'others' that Europe and
European discourse had systematically colonized, enslaved, and
marginalized. Europe (and the US) wanted to blank out and reabsorb those
racial others who refused their role as nature and nature as a thing;
the answer was to rethink space. Recently, with the 'extensive and
intensive extraction of matter from the earth, in the form of fossil
fuels, soil nutrients to feed crops and livestock, and the (human and
more-than-human) work' and 'the internal energy of African slaves and
Indigenous lands' which 'now exist \... as the form of global capital'
(da Silva, 2018), thinking historically and naturally has been
problematized and even replaced by thinking about crisis and the future.
**[Despite its apparent valorization of crisis, discourse on time does
not easily engorge the racial others.]{.underline}** Even nature, the
global capital's utopic wish-form, functions as a 'cannibalistic force,'
encircling everything in its 'gigantic phagocytosis' (Caillois &
Shepley, 1984, p. 28). **[Drawing on indigenous climate change studies
and the Plantationocene, Bikrum Gill argues the 'decolonial turn in the
epoch debates has foregrounded Indigenous and Black alterity as the
necess- ary epistemic point of departure for overcoming social and
ecological crises']{.underline}** (2021, p. 913) thereby challenging the
idea that the human must be removed. [As he further argues, the
'question of restor- ing the earth' is 'one of centreing Indigenous and
Black sovereignties that resurge/restore social- geological capacities
that both brought into being, and sustained over a long durée, the earth
system as composition of distinct, yet co-constituting,
earth-worldings']{.underline} (Gill, 2021, p. 926). Gill orients the
reader to moving beyond conquest and focusing on what he calls the
Cortesian axis, that is, the time when the 'capitalist enclosure' and
the racialized production of the society/nature distinctions occurred by
'appropriating Indigenous and Black earth-worlds' as well as exhausting
them ecolo- gically by erasing 'their underlying conditions' of
possibility (Gill, 2021, p. 926). [This reading points to deeper
temporal connections that evade the underlying
'social-ecological/social-geological reproductive
conditions']{.underline} (Gill, 2021, p. 925) that make possible the
epistemes of ecologists and environmentalists, including how human and
nonhuman ecologies are sutured together; thus, **[pla- netary, and
racial justice cannot be achieved through separated efforts and not
through the disman- tling of racial capitalism without engaging with its
structures of time.]{.underline}** **[Several authors have put pressure
on the dominant structure of time of this regime by challen- ging its
Coordinated Universal Time]{.underline}** (e.g. Baucom, 2014; Opperman,
2020; Wynter, 2003) **[and the social-ecological relations of
capitalism]{.underline}**. **[They question the edifice of time: as
'linear, predictable and \[guided by the\] disciplining coordination
metrics of modern clocks and calendars']{.underline}** (Kolinjivadi et
al., 2020, p. 906). **[Naturalizing time as a fixed and presupposed
object to be leveraged for accumu- lation planetary regimes reinforces
global capital's assumptions about its 'eternal scarcity' and 'growth
imperative' (Kolinjivadi et al., 2020, p. 906]{.underline}**). Inquiring
into the ways the planetary and its contingent institutions are bounded
reveals how certain structures of time are prescribed in his- tories and
destinies in advance. It is important to challenge the easy reading of
geographical con- texts and time, for instance, of suturing context and
nature and context and culture. A taken-for- granted geographical
context such as a national territory or locality only allows circular
self-refer- encing, ''proving' itself by means of its own production,
its 'context'' (Walker, 2012, p. 8). In this sense, analysis becomes
implicit or marginalized in the name of proving history, context, or
gram- mars and logics, as in the epoch debates of setting the 'date,'
the 'Anthropocene,' and the 'Capita- locene' (Amoureux & Reddy, 2021;
Gill, 2021; Kolia, 2021) as well as identifying geographies that confirm
abstract notions of genocide and exploitation. The stakes in these
debates are not just to get the date (origin or otherwise) right by
either presupposing it or injecting it at some point in the future; the
goal is to see whether it is possible for the invention of existence or
that moment 'whose destination cannot be foreseen, or anticipated, but
only repeatedly traveled, and, therefore, not future at all' (Marriott,
2011a, p. 54), that 'moment of inventiveness' (Marriott, 2011a, pp. 53--
54) 'to change the order of the world' (Fanon, 1967, p. 36). We stretch
these authors' analytics. We argue colonial and enslaving extractions
and grammars have immured nature and the source of existence in the
making of a planetary, as their primary goal is to settle to whom the
earth belongs (Mbembe, 2021). Through this process, racial imperial
capital retroactively invalidates dynamic and heterogeneous
temporalities and existential relations by claiming it functions because
of its own birthed locality. **[Thus, thinking and imagining decolonial
compositions requires a leap, an invention to overturn what planetary
racial capitalist regimes block: potential inventions for a decolonial
planetary.]{.underline}**

Key developments **[We are faced with a major question: what to do about
climate change, or as we choose to call it, planetary
decimation]{.underline}**. **[This is not a national question, and its
effects cannot be contained within territorial borders. It is a global
issue affecting how states make decisions and operate in the
international system.]{.underline}** Citizens, businesses, and
policymakers are addressing this global issue. [Global movements are
attempting to convince states to change their behaviors and
significantly reduce their carbon emissions. Global temperatures, many
scientists are arguing, cannot be allowed to rise 2°C above
pre-industrial levels because this will cause sea levels to rise,
generate severe drought, lead to massive floods, melt polar ice caps,
create agricultural crises, and impact water sources**. Interstate
conflict will intensify because of diminishing resources (Carter 2010:
52--53).**]{.underline} [Many analysts argue, for instance, that the
Syrian civil war that began in 2011 was partly caused by years of
drought and agricultural stresses in the years that preceded
it.]{.underline} President Biden has put forward a plan to ensure the
power sector moves to net zero emissions. He has called for steep and
immediate reductions in energy sector CO2 emissions and the development
of clean energy technologies to ensure net zero emissions by 2050. The
European Union agreed that by 2030, the 27-country bloc would source
42.5% of its energy from renewable sources like wind and solar, with a
potential top-up to 45%. **[As resources are finite, some states may see
climate change as an opportunity to bolster their defense
capabilities.]{.underline}** Instead of cooperating to protect the
planet, they may seek to maximize their energy security at the expense
of other states and the environment, even when the effects of climate
change may be detrimental for most of the world. Some frame planetary
decimation in military language as the "collateral damage" of history,
as the unintended by-product of industrialization, or the "tragedy of
the commons," a concept coined by American ecologist Garrett Hardin
(1968) to refer to "areas and resources that do not fall under sovereign
jurisdiction ... such as the high seas, deep ocean floor and global
atmosphere" (Volger 2014: 347). Others seem to think political responses
are not necessary because of the many technological and free market
advances to solve the crisis. Alternatively, they individualize this
phenomenon by calling for people to buy electric cars or use products
that are environmentally friendly. What other ways of dealing with
climate change could be possible if we addressed an integral part of
racism in climate change and its effects on the security of different
communities? Seen from the vantage point of colonialism, **[this
decimation has been an "intentional project," part of the global racial
capitalist project.]{.underline}** [Eyal Weizman (2016) tells us it was
undertaken by colonial administrators in the 18th century who sought not
just to "mask the physical reality of newly discovered lands, but to
engineer and change the environments, including their cyclical climate
patterns."]{.underline} Deploying different mechanisms to transform
nature, such as draining swamps and constructing towns and cities, they
participated in the active deforestation of colonized zones.
**[Centralizing human action, they deployed colonial-racial capitalist
approaches such as management, technocracy, and profit-oriented. They
turned "nature" into their "design object; as a form of government over
nature and man" (Weizman 2016).]{.underline}** [These approaches were
shaped by scientific notions of racism. Thomas Jefferson believed
climate change determined social and political structures. He argued
northern peoples were better at adapting to environmental changes
because they had a stronger work ethic and better deployment of capacity
and will to respond to climate changes. Those in the tropics, he argued,
were lazy, promiscuous, and degenerate because their seasons were less
distinct.]{.underline} This kind of global structural racism expressed
by Jefferson and many others was at the root of the processes of forced
integration of colonized countries into the world market. **[Racism and
in/security, linked to colonialism and world capitalism, led to economic
and ecological disasters much earlier than we commonly
think.]{.underline}** [For example, in 1943, India suffered a major
crisis -- the Bengal Famine. Millions died (see Chapter 19 in this
volume). India was still a British colony at the time. Indians were
blamed for the rampant population growth of the poor, when, in fact, the
British had followed policies of maximal grain extraction and
stockpiling. Amartya Sen argues this famine was man-made, highlighting
the racism of the British (Sen 1981).]{.underline} [There was no
"natural famine." It was genocide. In other parts of the world,
including Algeria, Egypt, Angola, Queensland, Fiji, and Samoa, imperial
policies meant staple crops were replaced by cash crops, leading to more
man-made famines]{.underline}. **[Anti-colonial struggles, slave
revolts, and rebellions challenged these racist structures of
consistently ensuring the security promised by the white social compact
at the expense and genocide of non-whites.]{.underline}** RESPOND: "WE
ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER"? [In the last few years, fires in Greece,
Cyprus, and California have caused death and destruction. For example,
the Woolsey Fire in Southern California burned nearly 100,000 acres.
Regardless]{.underline} of their cause (human error, lightning, etc.)
these fires have increased due to anthropogenic climate change. At first
glance, we may think all these **[fires across the world are emblematic
of the thinking that "we are all in this climate change together." Yet
this is not the case]{.underline}**. [Over the past decade and a half,
major insurance companies like AIG and Chubb have begun to offer private
emergency services to elite policyholders.]{.underline} **[This is the
way that the market (as liberals tell us) commodifies
risk]{.underline}**. These insurance companies sell insurance against
climate damage and provide access to services to prevent having to pay
out when damage occurs. The approach accommodates a firm's desire to
sell its products at a profit without having to pay exorbitant amounts
to cover insured losses. [**From the buyer's perspective, paying a high
cost is worth it, because of the sense of security.** Both win in this
scenario]{.underline}. **[The common narrative is that climate change is
shared by all, and there is only one "climate realism." In this
narrative, the crisis is abstract, and the individual]{.underline}**
(the universal subject and the geological agent of politics) **[will
respond to ensure the security of a collective "we."]{.underline}**
**[Yet climate change itself is not the crisis.]{.underline}** What is
missed is that **[the ecological landscape is not equally shared by
all.]{.underline}** For example, [privatized services, such as
insurance, simply reinforce the ongoing global racial capital project
where some participate and others do not.]{.underline} Among these
privileged groups and the ruling class, we find those who perform
governance and security. **[The Black Lives Matter movement brings home
this ridiculous attempt to universalize planetary
decimation.]{.underline}** **[It highlights how Black communities are
disproportionately located in zones which are physically vulnerable to
climate hazards,3 such as hurricanes and flooding]{.underline}**. [The
government does not provide them with equal levels of protection. For
example, **Hurricane Katrina highlighted the structural racism behind**
the unequal flood protection in New Orleans,4 where distribution of
government funding based on racism resulted in subpar levee protection
for **Black neighborhoods**]{.underline}. [Eighty percent of the homes
that were lost belonged to Blacks.]{.underline} [Yet in the aftermath of
the disaster, plans for redevelopment of New Orleans privileged white
communities with easy access to recovery aid and
ssdevelopment.]{.underline} Letting the market introduce and implement
mitigation and adaptation policies is seen by some as the possible
solution to climate change. **[A more reflexive analysis of problems
within the liberal world order would lead to different policy solutions
addressing global structural racism and its entanglement with
security.]{.underline}** Put differently, governance and security cannot
be only for the few.

#### Framing climate change through crisis rhetoric imagines a white planet and erases indigenous people.

[**Ideas of ice** as a vibrant materiality and cold as an affective
dimension **have been deployed** differently **to service projects of
anti- Blackness and anti- Indigeneity through environmental
determinism** and other colonial enterprises.]{.underline} I aim to
bring attention to some of these moments.

Relations with ice and other matter can constitute ontological and
cosmological orientations for particular humans and polities, and such
elements can also be organized and manipulated for violent means. Such
elements can be materialities and metaphors for violence itself. [As
Chris- tina Sharpe writes, "Antiblackness is pervasive as climate," 49
in con- cert with "the totality of the environments in which we
struggle]{.underline}; [the machines in which we live; what I am calling
the weather]{.underline}." 50 In the con- text of ice, I follow Emilie
Cameron as she puts it: "I am not willing to abandon an analysis of how
prevailing structures and practices shape . . . relations" and that we
should be "interested in taking sides on the question of who and what
matters in the ordering of the contemporary North." 51 I am interested
in taking sides. Analyses of materiality necessi- tates a critical
engagement with violence yet cannot be fully encompassed by violence
alone.

[Part of this insistence is to **avoid narrative problematics that
continue** to accumulate **in relation to** **Indigenous peoples** and
ice]{.underline}. [By consequence of their long- standing relationships
to ice, **they are some of the first groups to experience the
consequences of a rapidly changing climate. However, those relationships
to the Arctic are extremely underrepresented in cli- mate change
research, scholarship, and media, especially about ice geog-
raphies.**]{.underline} **[When present, they are most commonly narrated
through crisis and devastation singularly. Many of those narrations
instead cast a de- peopled, melting icescape as an iconic representation
of climate change]{.underline}**. [**This melt wreaks havoc on an
inferred, doomed white, settled planet, and all the while ice remains
unmoored from its social- political origins and contexts.** These
generalizations of ice from nowhere melting into every- where efface
differential capitalist and colonial violences and Indigenous peoples'
political, distinct, and long- standing relationships and organiz- ing
with ice geographies]{.underline}. Recent critical work on the Arctic
offers a fuller representation of long- standing Indigenous histories
and ongoing pol- itics.52 Other contributions arrive in the form of
assessing traditional ecological knowledge (tek), Indigenous mapping, or
examining environ- mental literary narrations.53

### Link -- IR - Arctic Securitization

#### Arctic policy over establishing Westphalian sovereignty is [doomed]{.underline} to reproduces racial hierarchies that marginalize indigenous voices. [Only]{.underline} a rethinking of policymaking through decolonial lenses [recenters]{.underline} indigenous perspectives in expressions of sovereignty. 

Notes - Card summary -- I think this link will function more as like a
link of omission, which is probably not great but I got too far in
before I realized so I js cut it anyways. Essentially, it talks about
how policies that are made without consulting arctic indigenous or
framed through decolonial lenses will inevitably reproduce western world
views which will intern reinforce existing structures of colonialism
(this card specifically gives policies over sovereignty as an example;
the sovereignty assumed by these policies are Westphalian conceptions of
sovereignty, which is over coded by colonial desires such as ownership
over territories)

**Gricius, doctoral candidate at Colorado State University, 2021**

Arctic Yearbook, 2021, https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2021
accessed July 8, 2025 HDCSW -- TW\]

Since 2014, the [United States' actions and policies in the Arctic have
reflected various expressions of sovereignty. Most call for advancing
American security interests in some way to facilitate commerce, deepen
international cooperation, and strengthen environmental
stewardship]{.underline}. In documents from 2013-2015, [sovereignty was
mainly expressed by the United States with a focus on **promoting the
Western multilateral order** through assuring peace, security, and
cooperation.]{.underline} This matches with [American interests in the
Arctic being primarily driven by commercial and security
needs]{.underline}, thus more internally focused domestic sovereignty.
From 2016-2021, the focus of sovereignty changed to one characterized by
reactiveness and defense. This arose in response to the resurgence of
great power competition. Here, expressions of sovereignty began to take
on a more Westphalian flavor to respond to perceived Russian and Chinese
incursions on the Western multilateral order.

[These expressions in many cases serve to **reproduce social and
political hierarchies that exclude the colonized** and do not
appropriately address the security issues at hand.]{.underline} Notably,
the United States' chairmanship of the Arctic Council illustrated the
nature of leaving out Indigenous voices. This was a multilateral success
for Arctic states, but the lack of inclusion of Indigenous people, whose
knowledge of maritime travel and non-impact shipping corridors would
have been useful, again serves to illustrate the continued power
dynamics at play that privilege Western ideas of states, security, and
sovereignty. As great power competition rhetoric began to heat up in the
Arctic, the United States continued to move its focus more towards
state-vs-state competition, ignoring the larger transnational threats
emerging from the environment, further using ideas of sovereignty to
focus solely on states rather than individuals.

In 2014, the main policy in place was the 2013 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region. [While this policy does mention the needs of Indigenous
communities, the focus is primarily on stewardship. In short, many
issues that are non-state based are mentioned such as climate change,
food security and environmental security. However, the response to these
threats is described as one in which the US' role should be as a
steward. **Stewardship is connected to the Western values of
exploitation** of natural resources and development within the
Arctic.]{.underline} This is reflected in the 2014 Implementation Plan
for National Strategy in the Arctic and the 2015 Year in Review:
Progress Report on Implementation of National Strategy. Beyond the role
of a steward, both policies address the establishment of ports in the
Arctic, partnering with academia and industry, and conservationists.
Although the role of Indigenous people and traditional ecological
knowledge (TEK) are mentioned as potential partners to consult, they are
described as having a consultant role rather than a co-management role.
[American policy in both cases reiterates the role of domestic
sovereignty -- illustrating how the state controls territory and people
rather than giving them an equal voice in the process.]{.underline}
During this time frame, there were no direct security policy documents
concerning the Arctic, but rather security ideas were integrated within
the broader strategies noted above. Because of this, the outright
question of security is subsumed within the themes of climate change and
does not focus on state-based issues.

Perhaps the most recent significant period of US active engagement with
the Arctic was from 2015 to 2017 when it hosted the chairmanship of the
Arctic Council. At first glance, the US chairmanship appeared to move
towards a more inclusive perspective with its theme of 'One Arctic:
Shared Opportunities, Challenges, and Responsibilities', but
[neocolonial narratives continued to play a role.]{.underline} [The
United States' three lines of focus within the Arctic Council were 1)
strengthening international cooperation, 2) steering the Arctic in the
right direction, and 3) promoting security interests by safeguarding
peace and considering science and traditional knowledge (Hossain &
Barala, 2017). The mention of traditional knowledge is notable.
Nonetheless, a decolonial lens immediately brings attention to the idea
of 'right direction.' **Who decides what is the right direction? Who is
involved in that decision?** Given that the US interest in the Arctic
was and is driven by both security and commercial needs, it suggests
that many of the people living in the Arctic, such as Indigenous
peoples, do not actually play a significant role in these
decisions.]{.underline} Here, we can see [domestic sovereignty at play
with the United States exerting its control over territory and people by
promoting infrastructure and resources development. By excluding the
involvement of Indigenous peoples in the development of this Arctic
security policy, social and political hierarchies place only Western
states at the forefront of decision-making.]{.underline} One of the
other hallmarks of the US chairmanship of the Arctic Council was its
drive to improve economic and living conditions of Arctic residents by
creating a Water Resources Vulnerability Index. While this does aim to
help individuals living in the Arctic, it also creates an explicit
numeric scale that places those without a Western perceived need in an
'othering' position. All of this is not to say that the United States
did not have many notable successes in the Arctic Council. The United
States worked on and concluded many legally binding agreements on Arctic
maritime cooperation, improved cooperation, responded to black carbon
pollution, and addressed marine diversity (Hossain & Barala, 2017).
Nonetheless, much of [its success relied on **reproducing hierarchies
that consistently marginalized the voices of Indigenous peoples** and
served only to place Western states' needs and wants on
top.]{.underline}

Policy documents that date after or during 2016 paint a much different
picture of Arctic security from a domestic lens. The Department of
Defense's 2016 Arctic Strategy only references Indigenous people three
times throughout the entire document. It instead focuses on state
threats, particularly from Russia, and the continued policy of the US to
preserve the freedom of the seas. In this policy, the [US is clearly
expressing Westphalian sovereignty]{.underline} through non-interference
in the sea. [This mode of expressing sovereignty reinforces political
hierarchies that the US has created as the hegemon to propagate Western
values and ideology.]{.underline}

#### Artic [international relation]{.underline} continues to [exclude indigenous bodies]{.underline} from the politic which leaves the being [dispossessed]{.underline} and without [sovereignty]{.underline}---Only being able to exist as [labor]{.underline} under [biopolitical]{.underline} rule.

'Government, as such, was introduced when the whaling fleet came to the

the Danes came to Greenland. Behind them came the Christian

**[In the field of International Studies, analyses of Arctic
geopolitics]{.underline}** and economic development **[tend to overlook
the process of transformation of the Arctic in a series of discrete
territorial jurisdictions -- and the colonial violence underpinning such
process is generally absent from historical narratives and theoretical
reflections.]{.underline}** Since mainstream theorizations organize
their gaze from the point of view of the State, subnational and
non-national, non-state political organizations are rendered invisible.
Therefore**[, the colonization of Inuit Nunaat -- and, in fact, the
colonization of the traditional homelands of many indigenous peoples are
excluded from theoretical efforts and reflections developed within
international relations in general.]{.underline}** The recent spike in
interest in Arctic issues has reproduced such erasures, thinking through
narrow definitions of geopolitics and economic development, seeing such
issues so long as they represent problems and/or opportunities for
Arctic States. **[This framework has rendered Arctic international
relations]{.underline}** into discussions and theorizing of Arctic
interstate relations**[, excluding indigenous political organizations
from such debates. An account of the colonial encounter in Arctic
spaces, more than a mere historical recapitulation of how States
occupied and annexed Inuit Nunaat into their sovereign jurisdictions, is
also a necessary step in comprehending and theorizing contemporary
Arctic environmental,]{.underline}** geopolitical and economic issues.

The **[colonization of Inuit Nunaat by Westphalian States]{.underline}**
such as Canada, the US and Russia**[, left its mark on several
dimensions]{.underline}** of Inuit life. Such **[populations were
subject to a violent process that combined attempts at cultural
assimilation with the disarticulation of their livelihoods and social
organization]{.underline}**. In her narrative of the environmental
history of the Bering Strait, Demuth shows how the articulation of
indigenous social and economic practices with **[the demands of distant
markets also brought about ecological imbalances that upended life in
Inuit Nunaat.]{.underline}**^5)^ While the colonial encounter did not
mean outright expropriation of land, the **[discovery of gold and,
afterwards, of oil in Arctic lands]{.underline}** and waters radically
changed this scenario. The material aspects of gold mining and oil
extraction required new technologies for controlling space and economic
activity, **[expanding State and capital control over portions of Inuit
land through enclosure.]{.underline}**

Bathsheba Demuth^6)^ and Jessica Shadian^7)^ have written detailed
accounts of the colonial past of the Inuit peoples. Although a people
with a large history of contact with European sailors and explorers in
the Arctic, **[the interest that the Euro-American world showed for
products present in Inuit land was a fatal blow to Inuit livelihoods,
society and culture]{.underline}**. Search for products like baleen,
whale oil, walrus tusks and furs **[articulated subsistence activities
of Inuit communities to the capitalist world market]{.underline}**. The
pressure in the US mainland for these products led European and Inuit
hunters to team up in the hunt for whales, walruses and even the Arctic
fox, nearly leading such species to extinction. The multiple dimensions
of contact between US whalers and Inuit communities **[left a trail of
disease, the near-extinction of these beings rendered subsistence
hunting almost impossible -- leaving a trail of dispossession, misery
and disease in the Arctic.]{.underline}**

In her account of the environmental history of the floating coast,
Demuth describes how **[sustained contact between Euro-American
states/societies and the Indigenous peoples of the Arctic also
articulated their livelihoods to the global circuits of capital flows
and global processes of capital
accumulation.]{.underline}**^8)^ Demuth's work is precious in its
description of **[the social and ecological impacts of
colonialism]{.underline}** -- specially when concerned with the
ever-growing need for resources that came from the region's fauna like
whale oil, baleen, walrus' tusks, fox pelts. Up to 1852, whale, walrus
and fox hunting, for instance, were oriented towards the subsistence of
Beringian communities, with the volume of activity ebbing in consonance
with the rhythms of the lives of such beings. The contact with
foreigners, specially those from the US, was initially driven by
commercial whaling and, eventually, moved on to the hunt for walruses,
substitutes for whale meat and source of materials used in the everyday
lives of indigenous peoples, and of Arctic foxes, valued for their pelts
as fashion accessories in Euro-American societies. This **[articulation
of regional subsistence economies to those moved by motives of
ever-growing profits of the capitalist Euro-American societies was the
main driver of the predatory hunting of such animals and caused great
turmoil in ecological and socio-economic terms.]{.underline}**

The predatory hunting of whales and other animals brought about a deep
ecological imbalance. Demuth's discussion rightly puts it in terms of
disappearing calories, of energy being syphoned away from Arctic waters
through the commercial hunting of Arctic animals. **[This process dealt
a terrible blow to the subsistence of the indigenous communities of the
Arctic, materialized in the emergence of situations of deep deprivation,
with the spread of diseases and vices]{.underline}** (specially
alcoholism) throughout Beringia. "The market" Demuth states "had taken
Beringian blubber and traded it back for empty metal
pots".^9)^ Demuth^10)^ and Shadian^11)^ highlight the importance of such
ecological imbalances to the expansion of state control over Inuit
communities. **[The perception of the social maladies caused by
predatory hunting was deflected to the character of the indigenous
communities]{.underline}**, both in Beringian lands, but also in the
rest of Inuit Nunaat, legitimizing policies aimed at remodelling their
subjectivities. **[Paternalist policies to remedy such ailments were
spearheads for assimilationist policies that sought to impede the
reproduction of the Inuit culture.]{.underline}**

The **[remodelling of indigenous subjectivities was one of the main
goals, pursued through Christian indoctrination and a preparation for
subsistence through work in capitalist economies.]{.underline}** Coupled
with the social and economic crisis brought about by the disappearing
calories, it is visible a process that, deliberately or not, was bent on
the disarticulation of non-European, non-capitalist social formations,
be it through attacking their material conditions of livelihood or their
cultural practices. **[These attempts to subsuming indigenous
subjectivities and cultural practices under the demands of global
capitalism, was another important aspect of State policies that sought
not only to extract products from the Arctic, but also to turn the human
element of the region into labour, making them "useful" for the
activities carried on by white settlers in these regions.]{.underline}**

**[While different colonialisms developed across Inuit
Nunaat,]{.underline}** it is important to note how, albeit presenting
different rationalities across time and space, **[they developed the
same solution -- enclosure and border-making -- to the question of how
to regulate relations between settler populations and Inuit
peoples]{.underline}**. According to Demuth,^12)^ the United States and
the Russian Empire had very similar concerns about the contact between
Arctic indigenous populations and Euro-American settlers attracted to
the region. The commerce of whale-related products and even of Inuit
labour in exchange for firearms, liquor and tobacco was seen as
deleterious for the civilizing projects such empires purported to
represent -- as well as a direct threat to the control over Arctic
spaces in the case of firearms. **[Enclosures and border making, in this
first moment, served to contain market activity and direct the flow of
goods and the energies of the populations to the objectives of the
sovereign powers that sought to claim portions of Inuit Nunaat as part
of their territories.]{.underline}**

With **[the interest in products of animal origin]{.underline}** like
whale oil, walrus tusks and fox pelts waned, and the price of such
commodities **[crashed during the late nineteenth century, this did not
translate into an abandonment of settler colonialism. The colonial
project got a new élan with the discovery of gold in some parts of Inuit
Nunaat.]{.underline}** As a commodity, gold had an important role not
only as a tool for economic development, but also played an important
role in the global economy due to the widespread adoption of the gold
standard. The discovery of gold and, later, of oil, constitute the main
turn in Arctic colonialisms. While harvesting or trading baleen with the
peoples of the Arctic offered little room to direct control over space,
resources embedded in the soil, such as gold and oil, demand that
territoriality and property are made clear on site. Moreover, **[the
exploitation of such resources is, from the standpoint of capital and
State,]{.underline}** dynamic in the sense that their exploitation
**[spurs a series of associated economic activities, seen as a possible
remedy for the poverty and deprivation faced by Arctic communities as
well as providing Euro-American settlers with the products and labour
needed to make such activities viable and profitable.]{.underline}**

These maps are not our inventions. Maps are only masks over the face of
God. There are other ways around the world -- Linda Hogan, Solar Storms.

1 In Solar Storms, Chickasaw writer Linda Hogan's second novel,
protagonist Angel Wing reflects on her Aunt Bush's fascination with
maps:

I was intrigued by the fact that history could be told by looking at
paper. I'd wondered before what it was about maps that occupied Bush's
time, and now I, too, became interested. I could see it myself ... A
deep map. They were incredible topographies, the territories and tricks
and lies of history. But of course they were not true, they were not the
people or animal lives or the clay of land, the water, the carnage. They
didn't tell those parts of the story.

2 Angel articulates the competing historical and epistemological drives
of mapping concisely through these personal musings. She continues, What
I liked was that land refused to be shaped by the makers of maps. Land
had its own will. The cartographers thought if they mapped it,
everything would remain the same, but it didn't, and I respected it for
that ... It was a defiant land. It had been loved, and even admired, by
the government's surveyors, for its mischief and trickiness and for the
way it made it difficult for them to claim title. Its wildness, its
stubborn passion to remain outside their sense of order made them want
it even more.

Here, Angel encapsulates cartography's prevailing contradictions, and in
just a few short sentences, provides more nuance than maps often allow.
We take Angel's insights to heart when thinking about our own
conceptualizations and imaginings of Indigenous mapping techniques, and
we explore them in more detail in the article to follow, extending
Angel's words to the orderly, yet paradoxically unruly, world of the
digital. In this article we consider the potential for and limitations
of Indigenous countermapping (and counter-mapping more broadly) to both
contest the colonizing work of dominant mapping practices, and to assert
alternative, potentially decolonizing geographies. In particular, we
address the immanent contradictions of counter-mapping, paradoxes which
are echoed in many modes of contestatory politics. First, within
countermapping practices, at least some element of the dominant mapping
practice is likely to be employed, even if only to be subverted; if
counter-mapping practices are not legible according to dominant
vocabularies and reading practices, they may not be effective in the way
the counter-cartographers desire. At the same time, out of necessity,
countermapping efforts frequently employ, and therefore are subject to,
the limitations of existing cartographic (and digital) tools. The result
is that the very strategies used to resist dominant mapping techniques
may also circumscribe the kinds of interventions that are possible, and
in some cases even reinscribe elements of settler colonial cartography.4
In addition to sketching the conditions of this double bind of
Indigenous countermapping practices, we also address how they are
strategically negotiated within the dynamics of localized
counter-mapping efforts by looking at several recent examples in the
Canadian context. This paper seeks to illuminate how [dominant
cartographic discourses]{.underline} are powerful, yet not entirely
free-floating; they [are rooted in material force, historical
sedimentation, and contested social relations,]{.underline} and
therefore it is both necessary and yet insufficient to merely 'disrupt'
them with alternative mapping discourses.

We begin this article by looking at mapping projects and colonial
techniques of geographical power more broadly, tracing how these
processes are laden with historical and spatial violence, while
grounding Indigenous counter-mapping practices within a long history
that predates but influences its incorporation into the digital. Drawing
on the work of Indigenous communities and activists, critical
geographers, cultural theorists, anthropologists and Indigenous Studies
scholars, we explore here the relationship between Indigenous
representations and articulations of land title -- what might be
referred to as Indigenous techniques of mapping, counter-mapping or
resistive mapping techniques -- and the dominant Eurocentric discourses
of cartography. We ask: to what extent can Indigenous articulations of
land and territory interrupt the colonial narratives that Western
mapping processes perpetuate? In what ways can Indigenous mapping
techniques rearticulate Indigenous presence on these lands we now call
Canada? What role does the digital play in contemporary Indigenous
counter-mapping practices? Following this, we briefly chart some
examples of alternative mapping techniques employed by Indigenous
communities, in both historical and contemporary digital contexts.
Laying out the many complementary and complicated contexts in which
Indigenous counter-mapping practices take place, our article culminates
in a discussion of the digital and the virtual, as we examine the role
the internet has played, and continues to play, in Indigenous
cartographical experiments. Through the lens and insights of spatial
theory, we look to the Amiskwaciwâskahikan map, an example through which
techniques of mapping shed light on the histories and geographies of
land disputes, however marginally. We argue that the Amiskwaciwâskahikan
map does have potential to challenge how territory is conceptualized in
relation to land entitlement, although its potential remains limited by
the transposition of geographies of power and control into the digital
realm. We further explore these implications through the guerrilla
mapping techniques enacted in the Ogimaa Mikana project in Toronto. We
conclude by considering the implications of Indigenous counter-mapping
and digital archiving, ultimately highlighting the ways in which we
should be constantly diligent and questioning in our use of these
nascent, and not so nascent, technologies. To paraphrase Angel above, we
are interested in 'the territories and tricks and lies of history' in
relation to mapping, but we also remain just as interested in mapping's
future.

Geographies of power In his influential text, Culture and Imperialism,
Edward Said writes, Just as none of us is outside or beyond geography,
none of us is completely free from the struggle of geography. That
struggle is complex and interesting because it is not only about
soldiers and cannons but also about ideas, and forms, about images and
imaginings.5 As Banivanua-Mar and Edmonds remind us in the introduction
to their edited collection, Making Settler Colonial Space, this struggle
takes a particular form in the settler colonial context; the authors
write, ['Colonialism]{.underline}, between the sixteenth and
twenty-first centuries, [has produced a profound and extensive
rearrangement of **physical spaces and peoples**]{.underline}'; they
continue, 'This has left an enduring and unresolved legacy in the so
called postcolonial present ... As a result new meaning and social
demography had to be carved and asserted over existing and enduring
Indigenous spaces'. 6 Indeed, [the struggle]{.underline} of and [over
geography remains one of the most significant issues facing Indigenous
and nonIndigenous relations]{.underline} in Canada. Competing [claims to
territory]{.underline}, [borders]{.underline} and
[boundaries]{.underline}, along [with fundamentally different
epistemological and ontological conceptions of land-use and management
delimits the possibilities for land-centered reconciliatory engagement
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples]{.underline} within the
Canadian nation-state. Whether through [traditional]{.underline}
topographic [mapping]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} increasingly
advanced [digital]{.underline} data-based [mapping]{.underline}
processes such as Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping,
geographical knowledge [continues to be produced, acquired and imposed
as a fundamental technique of shoring up dominant
conceptualizations]{.underline} of the Canadian landscape. [The
surveying of lands and the production of maps remain an integral mode of
solidifying nationalist, and indeed, settler colonialist constructions
of]{.underline} Canada's [geography]{.underline}. Unearthing,
understanding and interrupting these Canadian geographies of power is
especially crucial in Canada's resource-driven, so-called 'modern treaty
era'. 7 What has or has not been mapped, what will be, or perhaps,
cannot be mapped, is of fundamental importance to securing or upholding
land rights for both Indigenous nations and the Canadian state. Maps
demarcate contested territories, represent institutionalized power, and
in many ways, fix the terms of future negotiations. Conversely, [maps'
absences]{.underline}, their exclusions and omissions, along with the
difficulty of actually realizing the lived experience of the spatial
knowledge that maps aim to convey, [open up possibilities for resisting
geographies of power and for a re-mapping of the landscape on other
terms.]{.underline}

A great deal of critical work has been done on deconstructing the
colonial discourse expressed through maps and map-making.9 Mishuana
Goeman (Seneca), for example, suggests that, ['\[m\]aps, in their most
traditional sense]{.underline} as a representation of authority,
[have]{.underline} incredible power and have [been essential to colonial
and imperial projects']{.underline}. 10 Centered on the understanding
that [map-making]{.underline} has never been an objective practice,
these discussions [situate]{.underline} maps [as instruments of colonial
power which displace Indigenous knowledge systems and seek to manage
Indigenous presence on newly settled lands.]{.underline}11 As Jeff
Oliver writes, 'A number of scholars have directly connecte[d the
hegemonic effects of cartography with the way that systems of
circulation helped to both entrench and justify European colonialist and
nationalist narratives']{.underline}. 12 'Such narratives,' Oliver
continues, 'provided an official plotline of colonial nation-building
from primordial wilderness to progressive capitalist state'. 13
Indigenous scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith (Ngati A wa and Ngati Porou)
reminds us about the connections between colonial policy, the mapping of
space and the realities of Indigenous peoples under such colonial
incursions; she writes, ['Imperialism and colonialism brought complete
disorder to colonized peoples, disconnecting them from their histories,
their landscapes, their languages, their social relations and their own
ways of thinking, feeling, and interacting with the world]{.underline}'.
14 These arguments allow us to understand [maps]{.underline} as a
mechanism of power that [produce]{.underline}s particular, [hegemonic
forms of knowledge within the colonial landscape]{.underline}.

In a very real sense[, the map is a form of knowledge that has the power
to dispossess]{.underline}. Maps are the product of choices regarding
content, arrangement, intent and management.15 [Their topographic
representations]{.underline} -- [inclusions and exclusions]{.underline}
-- [are not arbitrary, and certainly within the colonial context, nor
are they apolitical. Maps]{.underline} render space as a plan, and [can
be understood as the 'extension of European power through
space'.]{.underline} 16 At the same time, as Cole Harris notes, [maps
serve the ambivalent, detached and pragmatic function of orienting
newcomers, 'conceptualiz\[ing\] unfamiliar space in Eurocentric
terms']{.underline}. 17 These effects of mapping are surely ideological,
and as Matthew Sparke has noted, drawing from geographer Nicolas Blomley
and literary scholar Richard Helgerson, 'maps contribute to the
construction of spaces that later they seem only to represent'. 18 Such
ideological configurations suggest that the land itself speaks as an
articulation of imperial power and as a single unified state.19 As David
Harvey states in The Space of Capital, 'The process of state formation
was, and still is, dependant upon the creation of certain kinds of
geographical understandings (everything from mapping of boundaries to
the cultivation of some sense of national identity within those
boundaries)'. 20 The circulation of maps as a type of nationalist text,
then, works to construct and shore up what Benedict Anderson referred to
as imagined communities.21 In the Canadian context, maps, and their
seemingly stable, objective representation of the colonial landscape
serve as one component of the imagined community of the Canadian nation.
[Maps become an instrument of certainty through which the nation-state
and ensuing settlers achieve a sense of political, legal and even
sentimental entitlement to the land.]{.underline}22 [These
processes]{.underline} persist and [have significant material
consequences in relation to Indigenous peoples' articulation of land
rights]{.underline}. The manner by which power, knowledge and the
production of space intersect in the settler colonial nation-state
overdetermine how land rights negotiations are able to unfold for
Indigenous peoples. Far from objective illustrations of space, maps and
mapping processes produce space -- [space]{.underline} that
[is]{.underline} seemingly [abstracted from the lived experiences of
those who actually occupy it, inculcated with imperial power-knowledge,
and ultimately commodified.]{.underline} Contestations over land occur
within this produced spaced -- what is essentially a space of capital
production -- and they are thus enframed by the disciplinary mechanisms
that support this production.23 However, while the picture that we have
thus far painted of the hegemonic power of Euro-Canadian cartography
indeed appears totalizing, we remain interested, along with many
Indigenous and postcolonial geographers, in 'the paradoxical capacity of
such cartography to function variously for and against the exercise of
modern state power'. 24 Like Goeman, for example, we are interested in
geographies 'that do not limit, contain, or fix the various scales of
space from the body to nation in ways that limit definitions of self and
community staked out as property'. 25 Ultimately, this paper aims to
understand how Indigenous peoples have continued to resist the
mechanisms of Euro-Canadian cartography, holding strong to Indigenous
conceptions of place and territory and their lived experiences within
them. As Kwagiulth scholar Sarah Hunt notes, 'Acknowledging the role of
the geographic imagination in this colonial history and creating new
representational strategies has been of concern to critical geographers,
in order that colonial and imperial projects overall (not just in
geography) do not remain unchecked'. 26 Indeed, Indigenous peoples have
been at the forefront of creating alternative representational
strategies, utilizing various forms of mapping techniques and
re-purposing technologies to their own ends, re-articulating and
re-representing their own experiences of land and territory in textual,
virtual and lived contexts. In what follows, we investigate the
potential of geographical imagination in relation to Indigenous
counter-mapping practices while remaining vigilant to their limitations
in relation to ongoing colonial and imperial projects.

After two years of [President Donald Trump]{.underline}, critics and
commentators are still struggling to make sense of his foreign policy.
Despite some hopes that he might mature into the role of commander in
chief, he [has continued to thumb his nose at most mainstream academic
frameworks for analyzing and conducting foreign policy]{.underline}.
Indeed, [what makes Trump's interactions with the rest of the world so
confusing is the way he flirts with, and then departs from, the
script]{.underline}. [He may issue policies and give speeches that
include words such as "sovereignty," "principled realism," and "peace
through strength," but they frequently appear cheek by jowl with racist
rants, crass opportunism, nationalist tirades, and unrestrained
militarism]{.underline}. It is [this uncomfortable mixture of familiar
and jarring]{.underline} that [has proven disconcerting for many
mainstream international relations scholars, particularly those
"intellectual middlemen" who straddle the realms of academia, policy
think tanks, and major news outlets]{.underline}. **[Yet rather than ask
how U.S. foreign policy might have contributed to the global environment
that made Trump's election possible, most have responded to the
inconsistencies of Trump's world vision by emphasizing its departure
from everything that came before and demanding a return to more familiar
times]{.underline}**. [International relations experts thus **express
nostalgia for**]{.underline} either **[the "U.S.-led liberal
order"]{.underline}** or the Cold War while, in [outlets such as Foreign
Affairs and the New York Times, they offer **selective retellings of the
country's past foreign policies that make them look both shinier and
clearer than they were**]{.underline}. These responses do not offer much
insight into Trump himself, but they do have much to tell us about [the
discourse of international relations in the United States]{.underline}
today [and]{.underline} the way [its mainstream public
analysts]{.underline}---**[liberals and realists
alike]{.underline}**---**[continue to disavow U.S.
imperialism]{.underline}**. For example, **[liberal internationalists
such as John Ikenberry argue that Trump is guilty of endangering the
U.S.-led global order]{.underline}**. [That system, according to
Ikenberry and **Daniel Deudney**, emerged after World War II, when the
liberal democracies of the world "joined together to create an
international order that reflected their shared interests," while
simultaneously agreeing]{.underline}, as Ikenberry once put it, [to
transfer "the reins of power to Washington]{.underline}, just as
Hobbes's individuals . . . voluntarily construct and hand over power to
the Leviathan." [The vision of cooperating nation-states may have
originated in values that first "emerged in the West," they argue, but
these values have since "become universal."]{.underline} [In this
accounting, Trump threatens the stability of U.S. liberal hegemony in
two ways: **by retreating from multilateral agreements** such as the
Iran nuclear deal, and by **refusing to participate in the narrative of
enlightened U.S. leadership**]{.underline}. [Future great threats to
global stability, Ikenberry grumbled, were supposed to come from
"hostile revisionist powers seeking to overturn the postwar
order."]{.underline} [Now a hostile revisionist power "sits in the Oval
Office."]{.underline} By contrast, [when realists such as **Stephen
Walt** or **John Mearsheimer** criticize Trump, they start from the
position that the liberal world order is a delusion,
perpetuated]{.underline} most recently [by]{.underline} post--Cold War
members of [the "elite foreign policy establishment."]{.underline} Walt
and others rightly point to the baseline hypocrisy of a "liberal
Leviathan," noting that **[the current fury over Russian election
tampering and cyber espionage rings hollow given the long U.S. reliance
on both strategies]{.underline}**. [This view accompanies a wistful
longing for the putatively gimlet-eyed realism of the Cold War, a time
when U.S. presidents understood that their role was to deter the Soviet
Union, prevent the emergence of dangerous regional hegemons, and
preserve "a global balance of power that enhanced American
security."]{.underline} Seen thus, [Trump's hyperbolic and embarrassing
nationalism is a symptom of the abandonment of great power politics,
while his fawning treatment of Vladimir Putin shatters any remaining
hope that his self-styled "principled realism" might take us back to a
more strategically realistic time]{.underline}. [In the words of former
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, watching the Trump--Putin news
conference was like **"watching the destruction of a cathedral."**
But]{.underline} what is Trump actually doing to destroy this cathedral?
What makes Trump's words and behavior so objectionable? Previous
presidents have pulled out of multilateral agreements, entered into
disputes with allies, and engaged in protectionism and trade wars. The
majority of the Trump administration's planned and ongoing military
deployments are in regions where the military was already deployed by
previous administrations in the name of the War on Terror. Moreover,
[Trump's national security and national policy statements are **littered
with the vocabulary of the very experts who find him so
terrifying**]{.underline}. [What]{.underline}, then, [makes Trump's
foreign policy such a singular threat? Trump's foreign policy is
disturbing because **it is uncanny**]{.underline}---**[both grotesque
*and* deeply familiar]{.underline}**. [Like a **funhouse mirror**,
Trump's vision of the world **reflects back a twisted image of U.S.
global politics that *is* and *is not* who we are supposed to
be**]{.underline}. [For instance, **deterrence strategy may require the
rest of the world to believe that the U.S. president might use nuclear
weapons**, but the president is ***not* supposed to hint that he might
actually do so**]{.underline}. [The president is supposed to be
concerned with regulating the flow of immigrants but **not reveal that
race plays a role in these calculations** by **blurting the phrase
"shithole countries."**]{.underline} [The president is supposed to
believe that the United States is the most blessed, exceptional country
on Earth]{.underline}---as Barack Obama put it, "I believe in American
exceptionalism with every fiber of my being"---[but not engage in
excessive nationalism by making "total allegiance" the "bedrock" of his
politics, or combine it with a commitment to **"make our Military so
big, powerful & strong that no one will mess with us."** Sometimes
Trump's utterances hit so close to home that they surpass
uncanniness]{.underline}. In an essay by Sigmund Freud on the uncanny,
Freud says dolls and mannequins unsettle precisely because of the
possibility that they might actually be alive, a discomfort that has
inspired nightmares, works of literature, and horror movies.
[Trump]{.underline}, by contrast, [is a living nightmare]{.underline}.
**[He opens his mouth and the things-which-must-never- be-said simply
fall out]{.underline}**. Thus, [when Bill O'Reilly asked him why he
supported Putin even though he is a "killer," Trump shot back, "There
are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?" Trump's
willingness to say such things has precipitated an **existential crisis
in the international relations world**]{.underline}. [U.S. foreign
policy, as an academic discourse and political practice, is built on the
delicate foundation of]{.underline} what Robert Vitalis has called
**[the "norm against noticing,"]{.underline}** [This **deflective move**
has long been the gold standard of international relations]{.underline};
**[under its rules of play, IR experts act as if the United States has
never been an imperial power and that its foreign policy is not, and has
never been, intentionally racist]{.underline}**. [The norm against
noticing thus distinguishes between **the idea of the United States as a
necessary world-historical actor** and **the reality of how the United
States acts**]{.underline}. **[In that reality, the United States has
long been an imperial power with white nationalist
aspirations]{.underline}**. [Given the racialized nature of U.S.
imperial expansion, it makes sense that]{.underline} Alexis de
[Tocqueville predicted, in a chapter entitled "The Three Races of the
United States," that the United States would one day govern "the
destinies of half the globe."]{.underline} In its early days, [while
still a **slave-holding country**, **the United States asserted its
sovereignty through genocide on a continental scale** and **annexed
large portions of northern Mexico**]{.underline}. [The country went on
to **overthrow the independent state of Hawaii**, **occupied the
Philippines and Haiti**, **exerted its regional power throughout Latin
America**, expanded its international hegemony after World War II, and
became what it is today: the world's **foremost military and nuclear
power** with a **\$716 billion "defense" budget that exceeds the
spending of all other major global powers combined**]{.underline}.
"Taking over from the British Empire in the early twentieth-century,"
argues James Tully, [the United States has used its many military bases
located "outside its own borders"]{.underline}---[now nearly **800 in
over 80 countries**]{.underline}--- [to **force open-door economic
policies and antidemocratic regimes** on states throughout the formerly
colonized world]{.underline}. [An extremely partial list of **sovereign
governments that the United States either overthrew or attempted to
subvert** through **military means**, **assassinations**, or **election
tampering** since 1949 includes **Syria**, **Iran**, **Guatemala**,
**Lebanon**, **the Congo**, **Cuba**, **Chile**, **Afghanistan**,
**Nicaragua**, **Grenada**, **Cuba**, **Korea**, **Vietnam**,
**Cambodia**, **Iraq**, **Yemen**, **Australia**, **Greece**,
**Bolivia**, and **Angola**]{.underline}. [Such interventionist policies
have **contributed substantially to today's inegalitarian world** in
which an estimated **783 million people live in profound
poverty**]{.underline}. In sum, **[for untold millions of humans in the
Global South, the seventy years of worldwide order, security, and
prosperity that Ikenberry and Deudney associate with Pax Americana has
been anything but ordered, secure, or prosperous]{.underline}**. And yet
[the norm against noticing **prevents foreign policy analysis from even
acknowledging---let alone grappling with---the relationship between race
and imperialism that has characterized U.S. international relations from
the country's earliest days**]{.underline}. [This regime of **politely
un-seeing**]{.underline}---[of deflecting]{.underline}---**[connections
between U.S. foreign policy, race hierarchy, and colonial
administration]{.underline}** was clearly not in effect when *Foreign
Affairs* was released under its original name: the *Journal of Race
Development*. This began to change, however, in the 1920s. Among other
contributing factors, World War I, the rise of anti-colonial
revolutions, and the emergence of liberal internationalism as a popular
ideology [helped convince foreign policy experts in the United States
and Europe to adopt a policy language oriented toward "development"
rather than imperialism or racial difference]{.underline}. [**Mainstream
international relations scholarship today remains committed to a
narrative in which the discipline itself and U.S. foreign policy has
always been and remains race blind**, concerned solely with the
relationship between sovereign states who cooperate, deter, or compete
with one another in a global system in which the United States
is]{.underline} simply, like Caesar, [the "first citizen" (Ikenberry) or
"the luckiest great power in modern history" (Walt)]{.underline}. [For
liberals, this involves a **studied erasure of the imperial origins of
twentieth-century internationalism in the League of Nations' Mandate
system and the complicity of Woodrow Wilson in
preserving**]{.underline}, as Adom Getachew puts it, **["white supremacy
on a global scale."]{.underline}** [For realists, it requires both
forgetting the anti-Enlightenment origins of postwar realist thought and
reinserting the "security dilemma" back into history so
that]{.underline}, with the help of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes,
[the world can]{.underline}---as Slavoj Žižek says---["become what it
always was."]{.underline} [International relations experts will
acknowledge U.S. violence and overreach when necessary, but routinely
**read the illiberalism of U.S. foreign policy as an exception that is
not at all representative**]{.underline}, in Anne Marie Slaughter's
words, **[of "the idea that is America."]{.underline}** [Slaughter, with
Ikenberry, can consider bad behavior **only briefly** and only in the
service of insisting that what matters most is not what the United
States actually does with its power but what it intends to
do]{.underline}. [Yes, "imperialism, slavery, and racism have marred
Western history," Ikenberry and Deudney argue, but what matters is that
liberalism "has always been at the forefront of
efforts]{.underline}---[both peaceful and militant]{.underline}---[to
reform and end these practices."]{.underline} Indeed, [even those public
intellectuals such as **Niall Ferguson** and **Michael Ignatieff** who,
after September 11, called for the United States to embrace its status
as an imperial power, framed their arguments in deflective, liberal
terms]{.underline}. By contrast, **[because realists project the
security dilemma retroactively into history (while also simultaneously
excising imperialism) they can only see the U.S. destabilization of
Third World economies, assassinations, and secret bombings as tragic
necessities]{.underline}** ([great powers, claims **Mearsheimer**, "have
little choice but to pursue power and to seek to dominate the other
states in the system"]{.underline}) [or as the result of liberals'
ill-advised desire to **force "our" values on other
nations**]{.underline}. [Both of these deflective strategies reinforce
the illusion that we live]{.underline}, in Nikhil Pal Singh's words, [in
an "**American-centered, racially inclusive world**, one organized
around formally equal and independent nation states" where some states
just happen to have more power than others, **and where the
alternative---Russian or Chinese hegemony---is too frightening even to
contemplate**]{.underline}. [That deflection would play such an outsized
role in supporting the **ideological edifice of international
relations** today is hardly surprising]{.underline}. Turn-of-the-century
British liberals who supported their empire also drew upon a variety of
different deflective strategies to reconcile the violence and
illiberalism of British imperial expansion with the stated liberal goals
of the Empire. Such [deflection made it impossible for these
thinkers]{.underline}---many of whom would go on to work as some of the
first international relations scholars in Britain and help found The
Royal Institute of International Affairs---**[to link the problems of
empire with the violence and disruption of imperialism]{.underline}**.
Similarly, **[deflection within international relations today obscures
the U.S. role in maintaining the profoundly hierarchical, racist,
insecure, deeply unjust reality of the current global
order]{.underline}**. [It also makes it impossible to address how U.S.
foreign policy]{.underline} (covert and overt) [has **contributed to the
destabilization of that order** by **creating the circumstances that
give rise to "failed states," "rogue regimes," and "sponsors of
terrorism."**]{.underline} Moreover, [it impedes any theorizing about
how **the widespread appeal of Trump's xenophobia at home might, in
part, be the product of U.S. foreign policy abroad, the bitter fruit of
the War on Terror and its equally violent predecessors**]{.underline}.
In other words, [in the grand tradition of liberal empire, **U.S.
foreign policy deflection actively disrupts the link between cause and
effect that an entire science of international relations was created to
explain**]{.underline}. [What makes Trump's attitude toward foreign
policy so uniquely unhinging for international relations
experts]{.underline}, then, [is the fact that **it is essentially
undeflectable**]{.underline}. [When he explains to Theresa May that
refugees threaten European culture or calls Mexican immigrants killers,
**he lays bare the meant-to-be unutterable fear of nonwhite migration
that has haunted British, U.S., and European imperialists and foreign
policy experts for over a century**]{.underline}. [When he summons the
fires of nationalism to demand an unprecedented increase in the military
budget, and then **gets it with the overwhelming support of House and
Senate Democrats**, he reveals **that constitutional checks on the
commander in chief are only as good as the willingness of Congress to
resist jingoism**]{.underline}. [When he calls nations populated by
brown and black people shitholes, **he openly advertises the unspoken
white supremacist edge that has informed U.S. economic, development,
energy, and foreign policies since the late nineteenth
century**]{.underline}. **[Trump's Muslim ban is simply the War on
Terror on steroids]{.underline}**. In short, [Trump's foreign policy is
unprecedented not because of what it does, **but because Trump will
openly *say* what it does**]{.underline}---and because of what that then
says about us as a nation. [**The discomfort Trump provokes** ought to
prompt international relations experts to **reflect on the failings of
their discipline to reckon with the relationship between U.S.
imperialism, U.S. foreign policy, and the constellation of xenophobia,
militarism, racism, and nationalism that haunts our days**]{.underline}.
[The fields of intellectual and legal history and political theory are
**far ahead of international relations** in their critical interrogation
of the ideologies that sustain empire at home and abroad]{.underline}.
In addition, **[Trump's election has emboldened activists to make
increasingly explicit the connections they see between a racialized,
anti-immigrant politics of domestic dispossession and violence and the
history of U.S. imperialism in the world]{.underline}**. [Unfortunately
the same does not appear to be true for the majority of intellectual
middlemen who set the public tone for U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}.
**[Trump is, finally, both the emperor with no clothes and the pointing
child, begging to hold a big military parade so we can collectively
acknowledge the naked imperialist power at the heart of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}**. [Trump practically screams at the United States
to look at itself]{.underline}. [And yet, the more he screams, **the
more the intellectual enablers avert their eyes**]{.underline}. [They
are busy looking elsewhere---anywhere really---except at that
nakedness]{.underline}.

[While **Western narratives** of the **apocalypse place the**
catastrophic, earth-ending **event in the future**, Indigenous stories
often cast the end of the world as something that has already
happened,]{.underline} the effects of which continue to reverberate
throughout Indigenous lives.1 Current apocalyptic fears in the Global
North coalesce around an encroaching climate crisis, this [**crisis
imaginary itself a representational form that obscures how the
increasing collapse of ecosystems**]{.underline} has been [**ongoing for
hundreds of years for colonized peoples both in the Americas and around
the world**.]{.underline}2 Such [**fears around natural disaster**, even
when understood as the result of human activity, **rarely cite slower
forms of violence** or prior existing **apocalyptic events such as the
dropping of the atomic bomb** and ensuing decimation of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.underline} in 1945. [The atomic bomb is one striking example
of a networked, and obscured, apocalypse]{.underline}: the uranium used
in the construction of the bomb was mined from the African Congo, the
Canadian Northwest Territories, and the Southwest United States, where
the first bomb was detonated in testing. [Existing alongside and setting
the preconditions for these nuclear events are the ways in which the New
World was settled in the first place]{.underline}. The **[Middle Passage
and the experiences of enslaved Africans in the Americas can also be
described as world ending]{.underline}**. Artist and writer Hannah Black
sums it up: "The disaster has already happened and this is all
aftermath."3 Indeed, to understand the [**apocalypse** heralded **in
1492 is to understand the coconstituted nature of settler colonialism**,
the **transatlantic slave trade**, and, as recently argued by Lisa Lowe
and Iyko Day, the **economics of "alien" (**figured by these authors as
Asian) **labor**.]{.underline} I use [**apocalypse**, and more precisely
nuclear apocalypse, **to further understand and complicate the
triumvirate of analytics** (dispossession of Indigenous life and land,
fungibility of Black flesh, and nonenslaved Asian labor)]{.underline}
that structure modernity and make possible its undoing.4 The narratives
of Burning Vision and Ceremony, a text I discuss briefly as a resonant
narrative of nuclear colonial interconnectivity, prompt a
reconsideration of the discrete difference between these categories. The
[**arguments that follow do not call for a flattening into sameness but
a stretching and linking of analytic categories** to understand how and
**why colonized peoples worldwide have been harmed by the atomic
bomb**]{.underline} in its many stages of production and detonation.
[The **comprehension of networked apocalypse** requires representational
forms that **blur borders and boundaries, both generic and
geographic.**]{.underline} The 2002 play Burning Vision, written by
Métis playwright Marie Clements, strains at the constraints of the
stage---of language and action itself---to [depict the interconnections
of Dene people around the Great Bear Lake region in the Northwest
Territories of Canada, where uranium was mined, and the peoples in
Hiroshima, where this uranium was put to use for mass
destruction.]{.underline}5 Other groups and geographies, such as
Japanese Americans and the Southwest bomb test sites, are also drawn
into the web of relations. The play has no discernible plot but rather
alights on and illuminates different scenes on the ever-moving nuclear
frontier---its center, if one must be located, perhaps resting around
Port Radium, the site of uranium mines in the territory of the Sahtu
Dene. Clements's "burning vision," a phrase that evokes not only the
flash of the bomb with which the play begins but also the fiery
prophecies of a Dene seer who in the 1880s warned of uranium's harm, is
a way of illuminating the obscured bonds and binds created in the
invisible force of radiation. The play, set on a circular stage, begins
in the first movement, "The Frequency of Discovery," with a flash of
light illuminating "scenes of human suffering" (the atomic bomb as a
moment of revelation, relating biblical apocalypse with nuclear
apocalypse and a colonial clearing of the land) accompanied by the sound
of a radio dial gliding into different frequencies, "creating different
cultural tones and telling different stories."6 Many of the actors are
double cast as both Native and Japanese characters; Japanese, English,
and the Slavey language spoken by the Dene are used, sometimes
simultaneously throughout the play. [In her global telling of nuclear
colonialism, "in which conventional boundaries of time and space
evaporate,]{.underline}"7 Clements also evokes the atomic test sites in
New Mexico, sparking a connection to the interrelated settler colonies
of the United States and Canada. This move also brings the play into a
literary space shared with the 1977 novel Ceremony by Laguna Pueblo
author Leslie Marmon Silko. [In the climactic moments of Ceremony, Tayo,
who has returned shell-shocked from battle in the Philippines during
World War II, is struck with a kind of burning vision at the site of the
Jackpile uranium mines in New Mexico]{.underline}, not far from the
Trinity test site where the atomic bomb was tested. In the expansive
considerations of nonlinear time and space proposed and practiced in
Indigenous narratives, there emerges an analysis of settler colonialism
that accounts for the global scope of capital and Western imperialism.8
[Ceremony and **Burning Vision approach the linking violences of
Indigenous genocide**]{.underline} and imperial war-making through the
global dimensions of World War II. Burning Vision, as a [performance**,
allows for a felt sense of geographic reorientation through
disorientation**, challenging readers and viewers to **perceive outside
the circumscribed borders of nation**,]{.underline} community, and time
itself, more so than Ceremony, dependent as it is on a literary plot
that both troubles and follows a hero's journey. The [**coeval violence
of the settler-colonial world power,** realized in the joint
relationship between Canada and the United States (the former also a
support to US invasions in the Middle East), **is manifest in the atomic
bomb and the multiple locations from which it is
developed**,]{.underline} each place bearing some wound from the bomb's
presence, even if the bomb itself has yet to be realized. It is at the
preblast stage, when [the bomb is yet to be assembled from radiated ore,
that the sinister network of unmarked violence might be
tracked.]{.underline} If we think of the (now) pan-Indigenous adage "All
my Relations," how might the turn to an Indigenous worldview (emphasis
on the world) necessitate a broadening of relations? How is that
relationality enacted? How does it change the consideration of what
decolonization would entail? [This **essay proposes forms of global
relationality built on shared experiences and understandings of
networked nuclear apocalypse.** Through **the making and detonating of
the atomic bomb, lands and people are laid waste.**]{.underline}
Wastelanding is the contradictory process by [**which colonial powers
deem land inherently pollutable while simultaneously securing the land
as the righteous property of the non-Native settler to render resources
extractable**.]{.underline}9 Wastelanding, a term developed to describe
the American Southwest, might be seen as one particular kind of
"ruination," what Ann Stoler describes as a process contingent on
"imperial formations."10 Nuclear war in Japan---and, it could be argued,
[in its **threatened forms in Iran and North Korea (where the United
States military has intervened and caused mass death by other
means)---is an extension of and indeed part of the ongoing and
never-ending Indian Wars fought in both Canada and the United
States**.]{.underline}11 In this way [the **atomic bomb and the other
uses of uranium by Western nation-states highlight the connected
projects of settler colonialism** and imperialism abroad. The **conquest
of Indigenous territories generated a durable representation of a savage
insurgent that the United States projected and pursued across
geographies on a "pathway first to continental and then to global
empire."**12]{.underline} While [Indigenous studies has generated
profound concepts for understanding the particularity of tribal
nationhood under settler- colonial rule,]{.underline} these concepts can
themselves be [transformed in considering **how settler colonialism,
reframed implicitly in Haxton's statement as continental empire,
interacts with processes of imperial expansion**]{.underline} and
war-making. The **[construction and threatened use of the atomic bomb is
a set of extractive and militarized acts that occur both on the domestic
foreign lands]{.underline}** of Indian reservations and in countries
abroad also figured as sacrifice zones. The sites of fast and slow
violence represented in Burning Vision and Ceremony---Indian country,
Hiroshima, and Nagasaki---are spaces socially constructed as expendable.
These [are locations where the end of the world is made to happen so
that it can be contained to one location.]{.underline} The containment
of cataclysm allows the Western world to thrive. The nuclear apocalypse
is allowed to happen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki so America can regain
strength by getting revenge for the bombing at Pearl Harbor and
guaranteeing absolute surrender. Within the United States' own borders[,
the **nuclear apocalypse is allowed to slowly leak into the bodies of
Indigenous peoples so that the nation, excluding Natives, can benefit
from nuclear power**]{.underline} without the damaging side effects of
radiation.13 These two disparate locations of different but related
processes of bodily disintegration demonstrate how settler colonialism
has often worked to bolster American imperialism. Fat Man, a bomb-test
dummy in Burning Vision who stands in as the everyman of late-1940s
America, states this plainly: "If you can imagine the end of the world,
you can imagine making the world end for someone else first."14
[**America was able to "imagine" the end of the world by imagining and
then enacting the technology that brought it about but only for "someone
else,"** namely, the Japanese on whom they dropped the bombs and the
Native peoples on whose land they built the bombs.]{.underline}
Wastelanding also illustrates the [**coconstitution of war abroad and
the domestication of once-foreign land**.]{.underline} Those [lands
conceived of as Indian are used as the depository of settler society's
coal plants, nuclear waste, and other forms of industrial waste produced
in energy resource extraction and production.]{.underline} Along with a
wasteland, they are also a sacrifice zone. This phrase, popularized by
Anishinaabe activist Winona La Duke, when read alongside the
contradictory representations of wastelands, harkens to Giorgio
Agamben's space of exception and its primary resident, the homo sacer.15
Through conquest, the US government includes Indian territories within
its jurisdiction yet excludes those areas still inhabited with Indians
from the considerations and rules of law, on a spectrum of various
contingencies, applied to the rest of the country. **[This inclusive
exclusion, which makes possible the expansion and accumulation by
dispossession the US economy relies on, applies as well to the figure of
the Indian, often collapsed as a natural feature of the landscape of the
sacrifice zone.]{.underline}** In Agamben's formulation, a double
exclusion allows the sovereign to suspend their own laws through an
exclusion of the homo sacer from civil society. The [entire **United
States could be said to be a space of exception; its condition of
possibility formed in the reservation as space of
exception**.]{.underline} As this [**relies on a continuing relationship
to Indigenous peoples,** it would seem to exceed or complicate a logic
of total elimination often understood as the settler drive to
genocide.]{.underline} The United States of exception extends not only
spatially but also temporally, constantly working to preserve Indians in
a historical past while also constructing settler futurity through the
continuation of apocalypse beyond a singular event of conquest.
Highlighting the particularly long-term effects of this practice, LaDuke
notes that the compounds created by nuclear reaction are "so dangerous
to life forms that they must be isolated for 100,000 years."16 The
reservations and reserves where many Indigenous people live are
sacrifice zones where apocalyptic effects are contained and thus only
harm the lives of those seen as expendable by the settler- colonial
project[. These practices constitute the kind **of "infrastructural
warfare" that constitutes necropolitical sovereignty, "the capacity to
dictate who may live and who must die."**]{.underline}17 [The **exercise
of settler-colonial sovereignty in America and Canada has been
predicated on assigning less value to Indigenous people's
lives**]{.underline} ---if not always their physical lives then their
lives as Indians---[to dictate that Indians or Indianness, always
indexed as a **radically different relationship to land outside logics
of enclosure, privatization, and extraction, must die for settler
societies to thrive**.]{.underline} The perspective of the apocalypse as
an always deferred but emerging event of biological cataclysm is made
possible by having already created an apocalyptic situation for
Indigenous peoples. Agamben locates the space of exception in the
concentration camps of World War II. What Indigenous narratives of this
time illustrate is the colonial locations of these spaces in the camps
that were first organized to control displaced Indigenous peoples and
then the reservations, which exist in a legal limbo between foreign and
domestic. [The expendable population is then **extendable to all other
enemies of the United States, along the transit of empire that is also
the international route of the Indian signifier**]{.underline}. This too
connects the life cycle of the atomic bomb, made from materials mined on
Indigenous lands by Native workers to be used against foreign
populations figured as alien threats to the coherence of the settler
borders and way of life[. The nuclear frontier, a phrase that
**encourages comparisons between the original violence of the frontier
myth in American culture and ongoing processes of American expansion,**
is the boundary between the land sacrificed to the **atomic bomb and its
deathly effects and the land supported by that
sacrifice**]{.underline}**.** In Burning Vision, the frontier is brought
forth and bent over on itself. A Japanese fisherman, Koji, is
"transformed to the other side of the world" at the instance of the
atomic blast, hurtling in the opposite direction of the bomb's
trajectory. The personified Fat Man lives on the test site grounds with
a little boy, represented as Indigenous and also described as the
"personification of the darkest uranium found at the center of the
earth." The frontier is the location of contact, where confrontation
between settler society and Indigenous communities comes to a head in
often disastrous ways. The nuclear frontier marks both where lands are
laid waste and lands where waste is laid.

Blackness vis-à-vis the Crisis of Pandemic

[On April 20, 2020, Deborah Gatewood died from COVID-19.]{.underline}
[Gatewood,]{.underline} a sixty- three-year-old Black woman, [did not
die from a natural progression of the dis- ease,]{.underline} which has
a mortality rate much higher than most common viral infections. Rather,
[she died from the force of anti-Blackness]{.underline}. On March 18,
Gatewood, who was a health care worker, drove herself to the Beaumont
Hospital emergency department to request a COVID-19 test after noticing
she had worsening symp- toms of the virus. She had been employed at this
same hospital for over thirty- one years but was nevertheless denied a
COVID-19 test and told to return home to rest. The next day, Gatewood
returned to her place of employment seeking care and was turned away
under the pretext that her symptoms were not severe enough. She was
against prescribed rest and instructed to take cough syrup for her
symptoms. By the end of March, and [after four attempts to receive
testing and treatment for COVID-19 symptoms, Gatewood lost consciousness
in her home.]{.underline} Her daughter rushed her to another hospital,
where it was confrmed that she indeed had COVID-19. Gatewood was
immediately admitted and intubated, as she had developed bilateral
pneumonia. She then suffered kidney failure, then heart failure, and
passed away. At the time, Gatewood was just two years shy of retiring
from Beaumont Hospital---the same institution that contributed to her
death.7

While one cannot say for certain Gatewood would still be alive if
Beaumont had admitted her on her frst attempt to seek help, it is
reasonable to assume that [her chances of survival would have been much
higher if her symptoms had been taken seriously from the beginning.
**Unfortunately, Gatewood's case is just one of many stories of Black
people denied access to COVID-19 treatment in the midst of a global
health pandemic**]{.underline}.8 [For example, nine-year-old Kimora
Lynum died from COVID-19 after being turned away from a pediatric
hospital in Gainesville, Florida.9 Fifty-year-old engineer Reginald
Relf, who was experiencing difficulty breathing and a high temperature,
was turned away from an urgent care clinic in a suburb of Chicago,
although he was advised to quarantine based on his symp-
toms]{.underline}. He later died, while quarantining in his mother's
basement.10 [A Brooklyn middle school teacher, thirty-year-old Rana Zoe
Mungin, died after being denied COVID-19 testing twice]{.underline}.11
[Fifty-six-year-old Gary Fowler was turned away from three different
Detroit area hospitals.]{.underline} He died from COVID-19 complications
in his home; [his father, seventy-six-year-old David Fowler, died six
hours later, also from COVID-19]{.underline}.12 These are but a few
examples of the experiences of Black people denied COVID-19 testing and
treatment.

The peculiarity of Gatewood's story is that she was employed at the very
same institution that refused to help her. [Why was Gatewood treated
like a perpetual stranger in a place where she had dedicated over three
decades of her life?]{.underline} In response to her death, Beaumont
Hospital released the following statement: "As patients come to Beaumont
for care during this pandemic, we are doing every- thing we can to
evaluate, triage and care for patients based on the information we know
at the time. We grieve the loss of any patient to Covid-19 or any other
illness."13 The cold unfamiliarity that tracks through this statement
contends that Gatewood was just like any other patient---nameless,
universalizable, and gener- ally grievable. [The refusal to name
Gatewood and her relation to this hospital is egregious by any moral
standards. However, what Beaumont Hospital demon- strates in this
statement,]{.underline} as well as through its treatment of Gatewood,
[is an insis- tence that care is a universally available standard,
controlled by an isolated metric removed from human error, and that her
life and death contain no unique quali- ties that distinguish her from
any other person or patient.]{.underline} The obvious elided fact here
is her employment and long-standing relationship with an institution
that at the minimum should be able to name her and acknowledge her work
beyond narrating her into erasure, as this statement attempts to do.
[Instead, the result is that her death is presented as though it were
nothing but a natural result of life.]{.underline}

[Beaumont Hospital, in this statement, relies on the fact that at the
policy level there are no discrimination clauses against Black people
that need addressing.]{.underline} Furthermore, the alleged violation to
which they are implicitly responding is sep- arate from the conditions
of Gatewood's work. This vague statement refuses to speak to the
question of whether race played a part in Gatewood being refused care on
multiple occasions. However, any relational encounter or assessment of
the biological status of a being, as in a value judgment of one's health
or well- being, is a racial proclamation, which is to say, there are no
conditions under which Beaumont Hospital could have avoided engaging
Gatewood through a racial lens, as all bodies are interpolated
racially**[. The refusal to address Blackness and its role in
denying]{.underline}** [Gatewood **treatment harkens back to a
postslavery insistence that racial discrimination or prejudices emerge
from and are reproduced through a combination of private or public
domains, including laws, policies, contracts, and so
forth.**]{.underline} [Consequently, a neutral racial sentimentality is
super- imposed onto all individuals and relations that exist under the
jurisdiction of these corresponding public or private entities, unless
readily discernible gross negligence allows individuals or particular
internal factions to be blamed for dis- crimination or
prejudice]{.underline}, [which is to say,]{.underline} **[race is
projected as a neutral or noninjurious categorization that becomes a
factor only in cases where malicious intent is undeniably
proven.]{.underline}**

However, what constitutes racial harm when all policy and protocols are
adhered to and no tractable racial biases are apparent? As Hartman
argues, with respect to postemancipation civil rights legislation, "The
definition of rights and the separation of public and private domains
enabled equivalent right to substitute equal protections. However, the
social looms above all else in facilitating the kinship of equality and
exclusion."14 [What Hartman illustrates is that **equivalence of rights
at the level of law** or, in the case of Beaumont Hospital]{.underline},
[**policy does not ensure equal protections,** which can be understood
in this circumstance as equal treatment**. An exclusive focus on what is
stated or implied in formal rules and regulations about the equivalent
rights of all individuals elides the power of the social in conditioning
Black exclusion**]{.underline}. [The social here means what Hartman
describes as "an amorphous and mutable domain that overlaps the division
of family, civil society, and the state; it is a crisis category that
designates the slip- page of the public and the private and the
'intrusion' of the bodily---health, hun- ger, and reproduction---into
public space of politics."]{.underline}15 Thus, malicious intent is not
an essential determinate either of Black exclusion or of Gatewood's
repeated denial of COVID-19 treatment. [Instead, the social, which
confers value and mean- ing onto "physical differences, corporeal
impulses, and racial feelings," sutures both conscious and preconscious
consensus making that subtends proximations of Blackness to constant
externally imposed assessment and valuation]{.underline}.16 The hos-
pital is essentially asking, How much is the Black like us? That is, in
the case of Gatewood, does the Black have the capacity to be susceptible
to a form of suf- fering that binds the socius together by a body
politic of sameness and poten- tial? Sameness here is the equivalent
human capacity to succumb to disease, and potential is the ability of
the social body to persevere beyond and survive the crisis of COVID-19.

**[The assumption that the health implications of the pandemic can be
assessed by attuning analysis to the impacts of disease on the human
organism of any population, particularly a racialized population,
isolates conditions and distinction at the level of pain, suffering,
mortality, and possibility as natural prescriptions of immutable racial
terms.]{.underline}** A New York Times article that discusses the
increased number of Black people who have died after being denied
COVID-19 testing and treatment states that "Americans of all races may
have experienced less than ideal care," given the current pandemic.17
However, the article does not provide evi- dence to support similar
hospital experiences regardless of race. Additionally, the article
asserts, "Black people are more likely to suffer from diabetes,
hyperten- sion and other underlying conditions that make COVID-19
particularly fatal. [So, should providers misinterpret or ignore
coronavirus symptoms in black patients, there is a higher likelihood
that the results could be grave, experts say."]{.underline}18
Preexisting conditions in this respect are positioned as separate from
or explanatory of the racial disparities in COVID-19 complications and
mortality. **[This viewpoint operates on a centuries-old perception
"that people of different races suffer from peculiar diseases and
experience common diseases differently]{.underline}**."19 However, Black
feminist legal theorist Dorothy Roberts provides evidence to the
contrary, arguing that "human genetic diversity occurs in a continuum
that cannot be partitioned by clear boundaries and that crosses what are
commonly considered racial lines."20 [This argument holds that **racial
science**, or the use of race in science, rep- licates the social
violence of racialization that (**re)produces Blackness as an unre-
markable and natural condition, which also served as a justifcation for
slavery and for the adverse social conditions that have existed in the
afterlife of emanci- pation**]{.underline}.21 **[Furthermore,
investigating why Black people may suffer from "diabetes, hypertension,
and other underlying conditions" necessitates a critical response that
opposes reproducing the racist belief that "there is something innate in
racial minorities that predisposes them to disease and early
death."]{.underline}**22 That is, the med- ical and social violence
responsible for exacerbating Black COVID-19 deaths is also implicated in
the proliferation of other long-term diseases that are com- monly
experienced by Black people. **[Thus, preexisting conditions do not
justify current racial disparities but exemplify why the structural
nature of the problem demands further investigation.]{.underline}**

What the death of Gatewood demonstrates goes beyond a concern with
immunological factors of mortality and morbidity and instead brings
attention to the opacity of the social structures of Black life and
death. Thus, the hyper- susceptibility of Black people to contracting
and dying from COVID-19 should not be attributed to biological
determinates, nor should race when understood as biological fact be used
to suture the explanation of cause and effect. As Black feminist science
historian Evelynn M. Hammonds argues, "Rather the appeal of a story that
links race to medical and scientifc progress is in the way in which it
naturalizes the social order in a racially stratifed society such as
ours."23 Thus, the position taken here, with respect to Black feminist
theory, resists the desire to view COVID-19 as carrying a relational
human impact across race, with isolat- able biological divergences, that
binds everyone together in similar crisis. Instead, I think it is more
productive to assess the social status of Blackness across differ- ent
phenomena, to demonstrate the impossibilities of cross-racial relational
ana- lyses with respect to death and the social conditions of dying.

In "Blackness and the Pitfalls of Anthropocene Ethics," Axelle Karera
inter- rogates **[discourses of]{.underline}** disaster and crisis in
relation to perceptions of ecological disaster. Karera contends that
analyses of **[the immense of disaster are predicated on an insistence
on collectivity that is bolstered by racial erasure]{.underline}**.
[Thus, the dis- cussion of the Anthropocene by many theorists
presupposes a Human or eco- logical teleological progression, together
with **threats of demise**]{.underline} [that **ahistorically subsume
Blackness into a collective form of being that is central to Black
suffer- ing.**]{.underline} Karera argues that, "insofar as the constant
recognition of our existential interdependency cannot substantially
challenge the many forms of segregations on the steady rise in our
current times, it seems to me that assuming the inevita bility of our
ontological entanglement may need some re-thinking."24 After citing the
work of Fred Moten in relation to what she calls "relationality's
inability to maintain its ethical currency when faced with the extended
rupture blackness sustains on ethics," Karera continues, "In other
words, relationality is inherently not only a position that the black
cannot afford or even claim. The structure of relationality is
essentially the condition for the possibility of their enslavement. I
wonder, therefore, whether our naïve reliance on a type of inherent
co-dependence has recently done more harm than good---that is to say,
has instead worked to obstruct the very possibility of a positive
transformation of our ethical sensibil- ities."25 [According to
Karera]{.underline}, **[the linking of structural relationality to the
condi- tions of slavery is key. For Blackness, segregation,
interdependency, and slavery are relational rather than legally imposed.
As such, the interdependence thesis (that we are all in this together)
overshadows how the social structuring of Black life and death makes the
collective "we" a structurally impossible equivalency, despite the
affective and emotional desire for such to be true]{.underline}**.
Integration also constitutes a problem of relationality or the lack
thereof. [More to the point, **the constitution of "we" is a form of
violence that makes the particularities of Black suffering indiscernible
under the auspices of equal rights and liberties in private and public
spaces.**]{.underline} In this respect, Hartman contends that "a
slippage between race and status can be detected in the uncertain
identifcation of the source of black degradation," where the locus of
suffering is frequently underscored because of the insistence on
perceiving the problem as the lack of relational congruency across races
with respect to specifc phenomenon like global sickness.26 **[Rather,
the conditions of suffering must be scaled outward, rather than inward
with a narrow focus on pandemic and disease, to address the ethical
stakes at the heart of Black death]{.underline}**. Thus, employing
Karera's "positive transformation of our ethical sensibilities" to
address the conditions of Gatewood's death requires an acknowl- edgment
of negligence on the part of Beaumont Hospital, together with a cogni-
tive mapping of how care, protection, and safety as conceptual
frameworks isolate [Blackness as an excisable contagion that is
subjected to gratuitous violence that so often leads to spectacularized
or muted death. By muted death, I mean forms of death produced by
anti-Blackness that go unseen, unaccounted for, or unknown]{.underline}.

[**Anti-Blackness and COVID-19 cannot be addressed by simply doing race
better. Instead, to address the issue of incongruent life potentials,
one must ask what is Blackness**. A racialized response to the fear of a
deadly pandemic must simul- taneously contend with the general Black
fear of death resulting from extenuating circumstances not linked to a
specifc cause, like COVID-19, but predisposed by the social
organization---which is to say, the structural positioning---of the
world. **Within the crisis, forms of social segregation, or violent
integration, are ampli- fed by the intensifed focus on the pandemic, but
these conditions preexist the crisis itself**]{.underline}. [As such,
the concern is not solely with racialized exclusion from hospitals but
with a critical concern with excisions from all spaces where Black- ness
is deemed an intrusion,]{.underline} or where the collective order of
things is defned and produced through the repetitious embrace and
removal of Blackness as an object of the will of others.

The hope-colonialism nexus

The main finding of this book is that colonialism and hope are
inseparably entwined. **[We see the politics of hope as the colonial
grammar of our time]{.underline}**. In particular, we find it important
to highlight two manifestations of colonialism that operate in and
through hope: the creation of a condition of being "hope-less" and the
control of time. The role that hope plays in today's colonial relations
has receded from view, and not even the critical scholarship has given
this political aspect of hope the consideration it is due.

To be sure, the connections between hope and political and societal
structures have been noted, especially in the context of global change.
For example, Arjun Appadurai (2007, 33--34) has pointed out how
democracy has had to complement its "methods" with hope. Ghassan Hage
(2003, 3) has highlighted the centrality of societal structures in
"distributing" hope among citizens. For Nauja Kleist and Stef Jansen
(2016, 377) hope is a political "trope" for movements that seek
transformation. Hope has entered societal debates in multiple ways and,
more than ever, responses to global uncertainty are formulated in terms
of hope. As a universal human inclination, hope is readily available to
be summoned and nurtured. Accordingly, it is there for the taking, also
for political purposes. This is what the growing volume of scholarship
on hope testifies to. However, even the scholarship that recognises the
political and social value of hope has not investigated the links
between hope and colonialism.

[While hope may empower those that challenge the status quo and seek to
transform it, the very same force of hope can be harnessed by those in
power for their own objectives]{.underline}. **[As we have argued in
this book, hope has lent itself to the colonial powers-that-be by
creating a global condition of being "hope-less".]{.underline}** With
this we mean that in adopting a politics of hope, a state targets those
who, to begin with, have had a greater need for hope, namely, those with
less political, legal and economic leverage. In their dealings with
states, indigenous peoples have been one such group. [The response to
the circumstances and claims of indigenous peoples, among other
marginalised and colonised groups, has been to offer hope, and hope
only.]{.underline} The irony is that while they are expected and
encouraged to hope, their hopes are constrained to be more modest.
Accordingly, those whose conditions impel them to hope more become more
"hope-less": they have less hope, less of a right to hope and,
ultimately, less to hope for.

In the context of indigenous--state relations today, states have
cultivated the peoples' condition of being hope-less by delaying and
"mincing" their initially substantial and challenging hopes. **[Indeed,
hope fits well into the tactics of the colonial state; by offering hope,
by saying "maybe", states succeed in making the people's claims and
demands more temperate and less threatening. Despite states actually
delivering very little and very late, if at all, they have managed to
sustain an ethos of hopefulness. This diversionary tactic lies at the
heart of contemporary colonialism.]{.underline}**

[Even more significantly, the colonial tactic of diversion that is
operationalised through hope, leads us to underline the link between
time and hope]{.underline}. Hope and hoping, as previous scholarship has
also noted, easily results in the normalisation of waiting and
stagnation for some (e.g. Hage 2003; Povinelli 2011). The assumption is
that hope enables people to survive their current state of dispossession
while anticipating a reward. **[This promise of a reward also traps one
in a requirement of endurance against time as the promised improvements
can be postponed indefinitely]{.underline}**. Summarising it aptly,
Terry Eagleton (2015, 44) notes that "hope is the fetishism of the
future, one that reduces the past to so much prologue and the present to
mere empty expectancy". The futurity and not-yet-ness of hope cause the
present to recede.

**[In a study of the Canadian Arctic, Lisa Stevenson (2014) offers an
account of the ways in which a colonial regime extended its power all
the way to the everyday life of indigenous peoples through the
management of time]{.underline}**. **[Studying the encounters between
indigenous peoples and the state, she demonstrates how the aim was to
"train and discipline" the peoples to adopt the time of the
colonisers]{.underline}** (Stevenson 2014, 142). [In Stevenson's (2014,
133) words, the Inuit way of life, which had depended on hunting,
cooking and sleeping when the conditions were right, needed to adapt to
the idea of time as "an extractable resource" that could be used wisely
or poorly]{.underline}. [Time became a commodity and indigenous peoples
were to use it "appropriately"]{.underline}. Reflecting on this aspect
of colonialism, Stevenson insightfully asks, "Is it possible that
\[...\] territory is a minor trophy of colonialism -- when compared to
the domination of time?" (Stevenson 2014, 133).

Our answer to the question she poses is affirmative; detecting the
patterns of contemporary colonialism requires an understanding of how
time is governed. In our view, the capacity of hope to reduce the
significance of the present is its most potent colonial force.
Historically, the ordering of time has radically impacted the peoples'
ways of life, to the extent of pervading their mundane and corporeal
practices. These interventions in the perceptions of time still have a
bearing. In our era of rights and recognition, the colonial control of
time has become less explicit but, as we argue, equally, if not more,
powerful. While states might no longer discipline indigenous peoples to
spend their time "appropriately" or "wisely", they have arrogated to
themselves the right to ultimately define the value of time in political
and legal processes that concern the peoples. Even more importantly,
states retain the authority to decide whose time "counts" and what
matters are "worth one's while".

This has become evident in our examination of the processes of
recognition and rights in Australia, Finland and Greenland. States hold
the authority over time and thus are able to define the length of time
that is relevant or sufficient to use deliberating the claims of
indigenous peoples. What is more, states may decide that certain issues
will not enter into formal political debate at all; that is, they are
not worthy of the state's time. This does not mean that such matters are
not of great importance for indigenous peoples. Tellingly, when the
Australian state appointed yet another committee to assess possibilities
for constitutional change in 2018, less than a year after the Uluru
Statement from the Heart was published, "frustration" over time became
tangible (Final report 2018, 2). The committee itself acknowledged the
lengthiness of the process, and similar observations were expressed in
the written submissions solicited from the public. Following is an
example:

Enough with the bloody inquires! Stop stalling. Get on with implementing
the calls in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. That is all. (Cleary
2018)

These are the words of Mr Julian Cleary, who provided his view on the
process of recognition. This exclamation crystallises the public's
frustration over the state's playing (with and for) time and refusing to
act. Once again, it is the indigenous peoples' time that is being
appropriated.

All in all, our contribution in this work has shown how, to a growing
extent, [**hope works as a colonial means to steer, mute and encourage
aspirations and to control time.** The states have harnessed hope to
work to their advantage, a move that signals the emergence of a new
method of colonial rule**. Indeed, the idea of hopeful indigenous--state
relations -- of justice and progress to come -- masks how the challenges
posed by indigenous peoples are repeatedly sidestepped and postponed by
states**]{.underline}. By creating an air of hopefulness, politics has
succeeded in luring all of us to think that hope is the answer, or that
"mere" hope is enough. [It is precisely for this reason that it is
pertinent to understand hope and how it may facilitate and, even more
critically, prevent transformations in contemporary power relations. We
should always start with a refusal to be seduced by hope]{.underline}.

[**Fanon told us in 1963 that decolonizing the mind is the first step,
not the only step toward overthrowing colonial regimes.** Yet we wonder
whether another settler move to innocence is to focus on decolonizing
the mind, or the cultivation of critical consciousness, as if it were
the sole activity of decolonization; to allow *conscientization* to
stand in for the more uncomfortable task of relinquishing stolen land.
We agree that curricula, literature, and **pedagogy can be crafted to
aid people in learning to see settler colonialism**, to articulate
critiques of settler epistemology, and set aside settler histories and
values in search of ethics that reject domination and exploitation;
**this is not unimportant work**. However, the **front-loading of
critical consciousness building can waylay decolonization**, even though
the experience of teaching and learning to be critical of settler
colonialism can be so powerful it can feel like it is indeed making
change. **Until stolen land is relinquished, critical consciousness does
not translate into action that disrupts settler
colonialism.**]{.underline} So, we respectfully disagree with George
Clinton and Funkadelic (1970) and En Vogue (1992) when they assert that
if you **["free your mind, the rest (your ass) will
follow."]{.underline}** Paulo Freire, eminent education philosopher,
popular educator, and liberation theologian, wrote his celebrated book,
*Pedagogy of the Oppressed*, in no small part as a response to Fanon's
*Wretched of the Earth.* Its influence upon critical pedagogy and on the
practices of educators committed to social justice cannot be overstated.
Therefore, it is important to point out significant differences between
Freire and Fanon, especially with regard to de/colonization. Freire
situates the work of liberation in the minds of the oppressed, an
abstract category of dehumanized worker vis-a-vis a similarly abstract
category of oppressor. [This is a sharp right turn away from Fanon's
work, which always positioned the work of liberation in the
particularities of colonization, in the specific structural and
interpersonal categories of Native and settler. **Under Freire's
paradigm, it is unclear who the oppressed are, even more ambiguous who
the oppressors are**, and it is inferred throughout that an innocent
third category of enlightened human exists: "those who suffer with \[the
oppressed\] and fight at their side"]{.underline} (Freire, 2000, p. 42).
These words, taken from the opening dedication of *Pedagogy of the
Oppressed*, invoke the same settler fantasy of mutuality based on
sympathy and suffering. [Fanon positions decolonization as chaotic, an
unclean break from a colonial condition that is already over determined
by the violence of the colonizer and unresolved in its possible futures.
By contrast, Freire positions liberation as redemption, a freeing of
both oppressor and oppressed through their humanity. Humans become
'subjects' who then proceed to work on the 'objects' of the world
(animals, earth, water), and indeed read the word (critical
consciousness) in order to write the world (exploit nature)**. For
Freire, there are no Natives, no Settlers, and indeed no history, and
the future is simply a rupture from the timeless present. Settler
colonialism is absent from his discussion, implying either that it is an
unimportant analytic or that it is an already completed project of the
past (a past oppression perhaps).**]{.underline} Freire's theories of
liberation resoundingly echo the allegory of Plato's Cave, a continental
philosophy of mental emancipation, whereby the thinking man
individualistically emerges from the dark cave of ignorance into the
light of critical consciousness. [By contrast, black feminist thought
roots freedom in the darkness of the cave, in that well of feeling and
wisdom from which all knowledge is recreated. These places of
possibility within ourselves are dark because they are ancient and
hidden; they have survived and grown strong through darkness. Within
these deep places, each one of us holds an incredible reserve of
creativity and power, of unexamined and unrecorded emotion and feeling.
The woman\'s place of power within each of us is neither white nor
surface; it is dark, it is ancient, and it is deep.]{.underline} (Lorde,
1984, pp. 36-37) Audre Lorde's words provide a sharp contrast to Plato's
sight-centric image of liberation: **["The white fathers told us, I
think therefore I am; and the black mothers in each of us - the poet -
whispers in our dreams, I feel therefore I can be free"]{.underline}**
(p. 38). For Lorde, writing is not action upon the world. Rather, poetry
is giving a name to the nameless, ["first made into language, then into
idea, then into more tangible action"]{.underline} (p. 37).
[Importantly, freedom is a possibility that is not just mentally
generated; it is particular and felt. Freire's philosophies have
encouraged educators to use "colonization" as a metaphor for
oppression.]{.underline} In such a paradigm, ["internal colonization"
reduces to "mental colonization", logically leading to the solution of
decolonizing one's mind and the rest will follow.]{.underline} Such
philosophy conveniently sidesteps the most unsettling of questions: The
essential thing is to see clearly, to think clearly - that is,
dangerously and to answer clearly the innocent first question: what,
fundamentally, is colonization? (Cesaire, 2000, p. 32) Because
colonialism is comprised of global and historical relations, Cesaire's
question must be considered globally and historically. [However, it
cannot be reduced to a global answer, nor a historical answer. To do so
is to use colonization metaphorically. **"What is colonization?"** must
be answered specifically, with attention to the colonial apparatus that
is **assembled to order the relationships between particular peoples,
lands, the 'natural world', and 'civilization'**.]{.underline}
Colonialism is marked by its specializations. In North America and other
settings, settler sovereignty imposes sexuality, legality, raciality,
language, religion and property in specific ways. [Decolonization
likewise must be thought through in these particularities. To agree on
what \[decolonization\] is not: neither evangelization, nor a
philanthropic enterprise, nor a desire to push back the frontiers of
ignorance, disease, and tyranny\...]{.underline} (Cesaire, 2000, p. 32)
We deliberately extend Cesaire's words above to assert what
decolonization is not. It is not converting Indigenous politics to a
Western doctrine of liberation; it is not a philanthropic process of
'helping' the at-risk and alleviating suffering; it is not a generic
term for struggle against oppressive conditions and outcomes. [The broad
umbrella of social justice may have room underneath for all of these
efforts. By contrast, decolonization specifically requires the
repatriation of Indigenous land and life. Decolonization is not a
metonym for social justice. We don't intend to discourage those who have
dedicated careers and lives to teaching themselves and others to be
critically conscious of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism,
xenophobia, and settler colonialism.]{.underline} We are asking them/you
to consider how the pursuit of critical consciousness, the pursuit of
social justice through a **[critical enlightenment, can also be settler
moves to innocence - diversions, distractions, which relieve the settler
of feelings of guilt or responsibility, and conceal the need to give up
land or power or privilege]{.underline}**. Anna Jacobs' 2009 [Master's
thesis explores the possibilities for what she calls ***white* *harm
reduction* models**. Harm reduction models attempt to reduce the harm or
risk of specific practices. Jacobs identifies **white supremacy as a
public health issue that is at the root of most other public health
issues**. The **goal of white harm reduction** models, Jacobs says, is
to **reduce the harm that white supremacy has had on white people, and
the deep harm it has caused non-white people over generations**.
Learning from Jacobs' analysis, we understand the curricular-
pedagogical project of critical consciousness as *settler harm
reduction,* crucial in the resuscitation of practices and intellectual
life outside of settler ontologies. **(Settler) harm reduction is
intended only as a stopgap**. As the environmental crisis escalates and
peoples around the globe are exposed to greater concentrations of
violence and poverty, the need for settler harm reduction is acute,
profoundly so. **At the same time we remember that, by definition,
settler harm reduction, like conscientization, is not the same as
decolonization and does not inherently offer any pathways that lead to
decolonization.**]{.underline}

Does recognition bring justice?

[One of the premier processes through which hope is infused in
indigenous--state relations is recognition. The general idea is that in
being recognised by the state, indigenous peoples will (re)gain their
rights.]{.underline} The contemporary struggles between indigenous
peoples and states in Australia, Finland and Greenland, as elsewhere,
revolve around rights and recognition. The particular approach of this
book -- the politics of hope -- has problematised the capacity of
recognition to bring about justice.

We are not alone in our critical view. A line of scholarship has emerged
that takes issue with the usefulness of state recognition for indigenous
peoples. A common source of criticism has been the assumption that, on
the one hand, the grounds for recognition processes are benign and, on
the other, that such processes will lead to equality. Indeed, in the
case of land claim agreements, it has been noted that the processes are
distorted from the outset and finalised only to the extent that they
conform to the colonial states' interests (e.g. Cameron 2015; Samson and
Cassell 2013). This dynamic was detected early on and, for example,
James Tully (1995, 55) has called it an "unjust dialogue". Similarly,
scholars have highlighted how **[state recognition tends to be
partial]{.underline}**. [Whether a case centres on state compensation
for colonial wrongdoings or the regaining of self-determination by
indigenous peoples, a "piecemeal approach" prevails]{.underline} (Erueti
2016, 104; see also Ackrén and Jacobsen 2015). **[This means that
states, rather than tackling the contentious issues or recognising the
indigenous claims at hand in their entirety, offer partial solutions or,
what Povinelli (2011) would call, "quasi-responses". Such tactics enable
the states to evade any of the meaningful material or moral consequences
of full and genuine recognition.]{.underline}**

**[One of the problems in state recognition is that even rights already
granted and contracts concluded remain open in the sense that states can
unilaterally withdraw from or renegotiate them]{.underline}**. Analysing
the internationally accepted principle of Free, Prior and Informed
Consent, Stephen Young (2020) notes how the noble ambition of securing
the consent of indigenous peoples in matters that concern them
systematically fails, an example being resource extraction on their
territories. Even though indigenous peoples have the right to be heard
and to have their opinion taken into account, states and economic
interests have the last word. As Young characterises it, Free, Prior and
Informed Consent, among other state-sanctioned rights, is a "mode of
legal contestation that states have approved" (Young 2020, 28). Indeed,
when indigenous peoples claim their already recognised rights from
states, they remain claimants, parties who by definition have no control
over the process and its outcome. In other words, being granted --
possessing -- rights does not signify the end of political and legal
controversies.

[Consequently, rather than affording indigenous peoples more control and
equality in their relations with states, the pursuit of rights may leave
the peoples in legal, political and economic positions with very little
room for manoeuvre. **Describing the vulnerable position of indigenous
peoples in Canada, one where they cannot, quite literally, afford to
withdraw from negotiations with the state, Colin Samson and Elizabeth
Cassell (2013) argue that the peoples remain wards of the Crown, with
poor facilities on their reserves, last in the queue for the jobs
flowing from extraction of the resources found on their land, and with
no control over their destiny,**]{.underline} remaining in thrall to the
Department of Aboriginal (Indian) Affairs. (Samson and Cassell 2013, 51)

On the basis of this ever-continuing bias prejudicing indigenous peoples
and favouring states, Samson (2020) draws the conclusion that claiming
rights does not benefit the peoples in any way. Echoing a similar type
of critique, Simpson (2017) reflects on the dynamic of rights,
recognition and justice and why it calls for refusal. She points to the
legacy of colonialism and problematises the possibility of reciprocity
between indigenous peoples and states:

Every possibility is not in the gaze or the minds of the master, nor is
the hope for mutuality (underwritten by a hope for sincerity) something
that all seek. History is also littered with those painful,
disappointing, mobilising stories of so many failed attempts at justice,
and also at times, refusal. (Simpson 2017, 29)

In a setting where justice is evasive, Simpson emphasises the need for a
"practice of refusal" by indigenous peoples. Refusal, as she
conceptualises it, makes room for that which has been overlooked or
bypassed in the state-centred discussion on rights. Through various
forms of refusal, indigenous peoples create space for their own
histories, experiences and narratives.

At the same time, as Simpson (2017) also notes, history is filled with
refusals by states of indigenous peoples and their claims. The critical
perspective on rights and recognition as presented in this book, and in
previous scholarship, reveals that this history is, by no means, far
removed from the indigenous--state relations of today. When it comes to
regaining their rights and securing their futures, indigenous peoples
would be hard-pressed to refuse state recognition altogether; states, on
the other hand, may skirt their obligations towards the peoples if
political and economic priorities intervene. States' insistence on
reciprocity between unequal parties betrays one mechanism that sustains
colonial practices. Far from the righteous ideas of partnership, states
exercise their sole power to decide the extent to which it is --
politically, morally and economically -- "acceptable" and "feasible" to
further indigenous rights. The decades-long processes of recognition in
Australia, Finland and Greenland demonstrate this clearly.

How should we, then, perceive the intensifying role of hope in
discussions on recognition and rights? **[As we argue, hope has become
an avenue through which states can conduct their
politics.]{.underline}** The way in which politics of hope permeates
contemporary processes of recognition is both a morally savvy and an
economically efficient tactic for states. [States are well aware that
they need to address indigenous peoples' claims and atone for their
colonial past, in one way or another. However, as the claims and the
moral duty to compensate historical injustices and the seizure of lands
fundamentally challenge the position of states, the reality is that they
are hesitant to make major changes or to relinquish power]{.underline}.
**[By instilling hope of forthcoming improvements in indigenous peoples
and repeatedly encouraging them to look to the future, states succeed in
playing for time .]{.underline}**

The particular political purchase that hope offers is that it persists
even under unfavourable and desperate circumstances with minimal
encouragement (see also Eagleton 2015, 44 concerning hope and despair;
Tängh Wrangel 2019, 671 on hope and fear). [In the context of indigenous
rights and state responses, the intimate connection between hope and
despair comes to the fore when states encourage hopes for the better but
do not necessarily make any commitments to remove
injustices]{.underline}. In this sense, a politics of hope also
functions as a tool for states to regulate the recognition, rights and
compensation demanded of them. It is a wellfunctioning strategy to
foster hope and, by doing this, keep processes of recognition alive for
decades. States may present the ongoing processes as evidence of
progress and refuse to initiate any new processes until the previous
ones have been resolved.

ten, if our ancestors could see the state of the earth in this moment,
they would most likely be less shocked at the alterations to the land
and more surprised by institutions of patriarchy and the mistreatment of
Native femmes.55 He writes of Native ancestors:

It is tempting to point out that they would have commented on the loss
of plants, animals, insects and ecosystems and the loss of traditional
practices in the precise ways that they were performed during their
times. But I do not think that is actually what would stick out to our
ancestors most. Instead, they would be quite sur- prised to see the
disempowerment of women and the adoption of heteropatriarchy in Native
communities, the lack of consent and trust within and across peoples and
nations, and the absence and triviality of nonhuman agency in human
affairs.56

[The flattened land relations desired by the ecological Indian
stereotype distracts from pressing forms of relations that keep
especially those who identify as women safe, supported, and loved---
which are also forms of land relations.]{.underline}

[The stereotype of the ecological Indian complicates the distinct and
specific political and legal ongoing relationships that Native people(s)
maintain with their homelands]{.underline}. These multidimensional and
long- storied sets of relationships that are distinct across peoples and
space are misinterpreted by non- Native people as the stereotype itself.
Within this rubric, the agency, complex navigations, and strategies that
Native peoples have needed to and continue to deploy to support tribal
and com- munity members that do not align with the ecological Indian
trope are then interpreted as anti- Indigenous behavior. Yet, as Andrew
Curley and Majerle Lister write, "[Indigenous nations are not only
subsistence com- munities on the frontline of environmental change but
they are also com- munities embedded in minerals and extraction at the
frontline of energy transition."]{.underline} 57 **[To overlook those
ongoing histories is to imagine Native peoples as anti- modern and anti-
economy.]{.underline}**

[The myth of the ecological Indian is also attended by the expectation
that all Native people will be "rural," even though many Native people
in the United States and Canada live in urban areas]{.underline}. [This
expectation is also true in ice geographies--- that Arctic Indigenous
people will not be urban--- yet, taking Anchorage, Alaska, as an
example, one of every thir- teen residents living there is
Native]{.underline}.58 Living in urban centers does not preclude land
relations; quite the opposite, as urban spaces are not anti- relational
and are also Native lands.59 Yet, there is an expectation that all
Native peoples live or should live outside of cities or will eventually
by choice find their way back to the communities from whence they sup-
posedly came. The popular idea that a measurable form of social change
comes as a result of a Native person "returning to their community" can
also be a colonial land relation. This expectation allows for Native
peo- ple to exist only in specific relationships to space that are
fixed, rural, and not mobile; that there is always a discrete agreed-
upon community to which to return; and that Native people should only be
working at localized levels. This return also overlooks earlier regimes
of enforcing Native peoples to stay within boundaries of reservations
while simulta- neously making any cultural activities there illegal, as
well as federally sponsored projects of relocation in the contiguous
United States during the 1950s, the explicit objective of which was to
relocate Native peoples from reservations to urban centers.60 The
expectation also erases the state- sponsored projects of relocation of
Native people in Alaska such as those from King Island to Nome,61 as
well as other politically induced relocations happening to Indigenous
communities not only in the Arc- tic but across Indigenous Latin
America.Many Native people, especially those participating in spaces of
higher education, do wish to return to their homelands and their
peoples--- but the expectation by non- Native people of the "return of
the Native" is an inappropriate one.

[Indigenous knowledges must be understood as entwined and inextri- cable
from discussions of sovereignty, self- determination, political gov-
ernance, and intellectual property rights however they might take shape
within distinct politics of place]{.underline}. Native knowledges are
practiced, main- tained, and conducted in the face of historical and
ongoing colonialism that take form psychically and materially through
erasure, appropria- tion, land dispossession, racialization,
surveillance, environmental rac- ism, and the prison industrial complex,
among other regimes. **[In that sense, then, caring for and about Native
knowledges is the same as car- ing for Native peoples. Within that
ethic, Native peoples are not always living full time "in the
community," nor are they always from federally recognized tribes;
people(s) are often operating in diaspora and in urban
spaces.]{.underline}** As mentioned, Native people are often urban and
therefore what happens in city spaces regarding land and climate change
is also about Native peoples and their knowledges. It is impossible to
extract one kind of environmental data from a web or framework of
Indigenous political livelihood. [Indigenous sovereignty and self-
governance, and therefore traditional ecological knowledges are about
many, many things, including but not reducible to material land or ice.
**Rather, it is colonial extractive infrastructures that reduce Native
peoples to land and their knowledges about land.**]{.underline}

**[TEK, then, is often essentialized and forced into a container as
though it could exist in an apolitical and ahistorical form severed from
the relations it co- constitutes. There is a tendency to reduce
Indigenous knowledges to something only botanical, ecological, or
somehow about sustainability, conservation, or
preservation.]{.underline}** **[As Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq argues,
"Indigenous knowledges are not secondary to western, 'scientific'
ones]{.underline}**. Indeed Inuit knowledges of our lands and waters are
scientific, sov- ereign, and often sacred . . . these knowledges come
from our commu- nities observing, interacting, surviving together, and
depending on the same lands and waters where our ancestors existed." 62
**[There is a drive to incorporate local Indigenous knowledges on the
ground, separate from political relationships in which they are
embroiled, to build a better set of representations for data, figures,
and, inevitably, policy]{.underline}**. [This is an inade- quate framing
as Indigenous science and knowledge sets cannot be brack- eted; they are
ongoing relations and practices that are political, juridical, and
spiritual and must be consistently maintained and
reiterated]{.underline}.63 **[It is not Indigenous peoples'
responsibility to save what has been contempo- rarily cast as a dying
planet.]{.underline}** [Native peoples, communities, and polities are
boxed by colonial regimes that make it appear as though they should save
a dying earth as mythologically, inherently land- based people--- and
not that they might have their own strategies as sovereign entities who
govern as they best see fit.]{.underline}

#### Infrastructure in Arctic regions produces settler-colonial mechanism to control Soviet territorial sovereignty and push imaginaries onto Indigenous populations that allows them to justify extractivism and stereotype Indigenous people as "climate resistant"

1\. Introduction: colonial atmospheres

As part of the Arctic Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) project RM- 2020,
[from 2012 to 2020, Russia installed eight new meteorological stations
on islands in the Russian Arctic.]{.underline} They represent a network
of weather observation points, [enabling the accumulation and
transmission of meteorological data from the Arctic without direct human
involvement.]{.underline} During the main synoptic intervals, the AWS
RM-2020 sensors measure and transmit meteorological parameters to the
processor block that further generates an output message to be sent to
pre- programmed emails with attached files of the \*.txt type containing
meteorological data. [Subsequently, a special software stores and
displays information on a map showing meteorological conditions (Idrisov
et al., 2023)]{.underline}. Along with the AWS network, the Arctic and
Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) deployed a novel high precision
hydrometeorological network in the marine and coastal areas of the
Russian Arctic based on drifting buoys. This project was implemented by
the AARI within the framework of the state programme 'Environmental
Protection' and the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and
Environmental Monitoring (Rosgidromet) programme for the modernisation
of the observation network in the Arctic Zone of Russia (The revival of
Russian meteorology, 2023). [The rapid digitalisation of the Arctic
helps reduce direct human exposure to severe climate and weather in the
north by deploying automated weather stations]{.underline}. [This now
fully automated experience was once an essential part of the heroic
narrative surrounding Arctic exploitation and as such fostered intimate
and embodied human-weather relations]{.underline}. The discourse
surrounding embodied experiences and adaptation in Arctic governance can
be traced back to the early stages of Soviet colonisation of the Arctic,
which laid the foundation for Russia's current policy in the region.

[This paper examines]{.underline} **[the development of a network of
polar meteorological stations as both an instrument of settler
colonialism]{.underline}** [and a mechanism of meteorological and
territorial governance during Soviet Russia's expansion into the Arctic
in the 1920s--30s.]{.underline} It demonstrates how the experiences of
Soviet polar scientists, shaped by interactions with various geological
and environmental forces, particularly wind and weathering, influenced
Arctic policy concerning the governance of both mineral resources and
Indigenous populations. This period is crucial for understanding modern
Russia's Arctic doctrine, a framework of ideas that emerged at that time
and has continued to inform Arctic policy today.

In line with this doctrine, in the 1950s, the Soviet Commission for
Northern Problems formalised an administrative zoning system based on
climatic and economic typologies, building on regional classifications
that had begun in the 1930s (Pilyasov et al., 2022).

[Grounded in a territorial development model that prioritised local
economic-geographical processes primarily for their contribution to
national economic expansion]{.underline}, **[this doctrine emphasised
resource extraction, population settlement, and large-scale engineering
projects designed to mitigate harsh climatic conditions]{.underline}**
(Josephson, 2014; Pilyasov et al., 2022). **[It also promoted the
so-called 'cultural development' of Indigenous peoples, who were
perceived as best adapted to the region's climate, though in practice,
many Soviet policies disrupted traditional Indigenous lifeways.
Meteorological stations]{.underline}**, [a key instrument of this
territorial policy, were not only essential for Arctic governance and
environmental monitoring but also]{.underline} **[played a crucial role
in asserting Soviet territorial sovereignty]{.underline}**. **[By
extending]{.underline}** [control beyond land into atmospheric and
volumetric dimensions---what Li (2024) terms **'sovereignty over
volume'**]{.underline}---**[these stations also became an essential
component of Soviet settler colonial policies in the
north.]{.underline}** The Soviet authorities themselves referred to
their policies as 'colonisation,' reinforcing the argument that they can
be understood primarily as a form of settler colonialism (see
Korobeinikov, 2024).

Building on broader conceptualisations of governance as the process of
directing society and the economy through collective action in pursuit
of shared objectives (Torfing et al., 2012[), this paper discusses
'meteorological governance' as the ways in which states, scientific
institutions, and other actors regulate, manage, and utilise
meteorological knowledge, infrastructure, and policies to achieve
specific political aims.]{.underline} There has been growing interest in
meteorological/climate governance during the last two decades, driven by
concerns over climate change and associated need for global monitoring,
as well as the technical infrastructure needed to buttress the emerging
structures and policy-making (e.g. Edwards, 2024; Tosun & Schoenefeld,
2017). In Russia, meteorological governance has long been integral to
the Arctic doctrine and a defining feature of the Soviet meteorological
project more broadly (see Oldfield, 2018; Oldfield & Poberezhskaya,
2023; Oldfield & Shaw, 2015). This paper examines Arctic meteorological
governance, focusing on meteorological stations as instruments of
settler colonial policies. Although McCannon (1998) has highlighted the
role of weather stations in disseminating Soviet culture in the north,
little research has examined their influence in shaping Arctic frontiers
and governing human populations in the region.

[**The role of 'weather infrastructure' as a symbol of colonial power**
has recently been emphasised in research by Mona Bhan (2023). **The use
of meteorological facilities, including weather stations, as sites for
constructing colonial narratives and imaginaries**]{.underline} [has
also been explored in studies on the relationship between meteorological
sciences and colonialism]{.underline} (see Feklova, 2019; Jankovi´ c,
2015; Lehmann, 2018; Li, 2024; Mahony, 2024; Mahony & Endfield, 2018;
Mahony & Randalls, 2020). [However, this framing of science and
colonialism as a dualistic relationship often overlooks the multilinear
dynamics through which **scientific practices and colonial structures
mutually shaped one another**]{.underline}. In addition, while much of
the existing research has explored the use of meteorological facilities
within settler colonial systems in the West, particularly in former
European colonies, there remains a gap in research on the Soviet
socialist system. This system had a distinct understanding of
'Indigeneity' and the relationship between human populations and
territories, particularly in the context of mineral resource management.
In Soviet ideology, all citizens, including Indigenous populations, were
metaphorically and politically integrated into the 'geo-body' of the
nation, where the collective body of the state was not only defined by
territorial boundaries but also encompassed its people as part of
geological productive forces (Mamontova, 2023). This understanding
contrasts with Western settler-colonial frameworks and highlights the
need for further investigation into the role of meteorological
governance in Soviet territorial integration and cultural assimilation,
and the lasting legacies of these processes. [This paper shows
that]{.underline} '**[conquering' the Arctic entailed not only the
physical occupation of space but also the task of understanding and
managing its climate as a strategic tool for extending the geographical
reach of Soviet political power within the Arctic itself and across the
broader Soviet Union]{.underline}**. **[This objective was set as early
as the 1920s, and Indigenous people were viewed as instrumental within
this policy.]{.underline}**

This paper is theoretically informed by emerging research on 'colonial
atmospheres,' focusing on the conceptualisation of weathering as a
socio-political concept. Two theoretical approaches primarily inform
this research: the colonial dimensions of meteorological governance (e.
g., Bhan, 2023; Collins, 2020, 2024; Dalby, 2013; Ghertner, 2021; Legg,
2020; Li, 2024; McCormack, 2008) and phenomenology-grounded
understandings of weathering as an embodied experience, particularly
those developed by anthropologist Tim Ingold (2007). The former approach
reflects the shift in political geography from focusing solely on
territories to incorporating volumes into research (Elden, 2013) to
examine how **[colonial power dynamics influence social hierarchies and
the marginalisation of Indigenous and local communities through
meteorological governance]{.underline}**. Central to this governance was
the Soviet state's 'vertical geopolitics' (Graham, 2004), which
encompassed the Arctic atmosphere, subterranean mineral resources,
oceanic waters, polar air, and drifting ice.

[**Building on Stephen Legg's (2020) discussion of 'white atmospheres, '
this paper further contrasts the experiences of polar scientists with
the racialised concept of the 'weather-resistant Indigenous'---a
colonial trope that framed Arctic Indigenous populations as inherently
more resilient and adaptable to extreme climates than metropolitan
scientists, which was often used to place them in a position where their
labour, knowledge, and resilience could be extracted for colonial
purposes.** This notion is used to examine the 'racialised geographical
imaginations' (Legg, 2020, p. 778) employed by Soviet authorities, who
positioned Indigenous adaptability to the Arctic climate as a mechanism
of settler colonialism]{.underline}. **[Yet, whereas in a capitalist
system, colonial adaptation narratives construct Indigenous peoples as
'vulnerable others' expected to become 'resilient' to climate
change]{.underline}** (Islam et al., 2024, p. 7), **[the socialist
system produced 'valuable others,' whose climate resilience was treated
as an asset to be controlled and directed toward national economic
development. Soviet authorities exploited this perceived resilience,
which was based on Indigenous Arctic experiences, to advance the
colonisation of remote polar islands by both relocating Indigenous
populations from mainland Russia to previously uninhabited islands and
sedentarising nomadic groups into permanent communities.]{.underline}**

This exploitation of Indigenous resilience can be understood as a form
of weathering in the sense proposed by Yolanda Collins (2024),
encompassing not only the physical endurance of harsh conditions but
also the socio-political transformations and shifting relationships with
ancestral lands under colonial governance and racialised imaginaries.
[Collins calls for a shift away from land-centred perspectives to
examine how **political power operates in and through the
air.**]{.underline} She develops the political ecology of atmospheres,
referring 'not only to crisis and capital, but to material and symbolic
entities that emerge from socio-political, economic, and biophysical
processes across scales and time frames' (Collins, 2024, p. 4).
[**Collins interprets weathering as a process that generates weather
patterns, encompassing human-induced weathering through extractive
activities that accelerate climatic changes.** She uses the concept of
weathering as an analytical tool to engage with slow socio-political
processes, through which the notion of 'colonial atmospheres'
emerges.]{.underline} This understanding of weathering as disposition
can be problematised and expanded to account for nomadic populations
whose dynamic and fluid relationships with territories, including
subterranean spaces, challenge fixed spatial conceptualisations and
complicate analysing settler-colonial policies. I use the term
'weathering Indigenous' in the title to encompass this complexity when
nomadic lifestyles are transformed into settled populations,
highlighting the coloniality of this reversed order.

Exploring the fluidity in the volumetric understanding of territory,
Steinberg and Peters (2015) highlight how the vertical dimension of
volume is often dematerialised, reinforcing a static, grounded
conception of matter. This critique is particularly evident in
solid-fluid territories, such as marine environments, where the fluidity
of territorial boundaries challenges fixed notions of territoriality
(e.g., Steinberg & Peters, 2015; Wang, 2023). Building on this critique
and following Marston and Himley's (2021) definition of territory, this
paper conceptualises the Arctic as fundamentally fluid---characterised
not only by shifting boundaries of ice, water, and geological formations
but also by the dynamic interplay of politics and cultural practices
that shape its imagination, perception, and governance. This paper
argues that **[the Arctic's fluid and unstable terrain, marked by
permeable depths, oscillating ground, persistent weathering, and
undulating horizons, was perceived by Soviet authorities and polar
scientists as both a barrier to colonisation and a space that required
Indigenous knowledge for territorial control. Soviet authorities sought
to frame Indigenous peoples as predominantly fixed and stable, rather
than as obstacles to be eradicated, in alignment with their aspiration
for a 'fixed' Arctic---one in which both the environment and its peoples
were manageable and predictable]{.underline}**. This perception
distinguished Soviet settler colonialism in the Arctic from other
settler colonial strategies, which are commonly based on the principle
of unbounded territoriality. Hughes (2020, p. 217) describes this as a
'strategy of territorial control best exercised by not delimiting
boundaries, by not making clear the extent of sovereign authority.'
**[Such strategies typically involve the erasure or assimilation of
Indigenous minorities.]{.underline}**

As primary research material for this paper, I use selected published
works by Soviet polar scientists, foremost Boris Ostrovsky, who were
involved in the construction of the first Soviet polar stations in the
Arctic in the 1920s and 1930s. Ostrovsky documented nuanced details of
work in the Arctic. Recent research explores relational experiences in
isolated conditions, such as polar stations and outer space (e.g.,
Battaglia et al., 2012; Mandel, 2021; Olson, 2018; Pottier, 2022). The
analysis of these experiences opens up a discussion on radically
different atmospheric ecologies in terms of time-space routine and
human-environmental relations. Soviet scientists' diaries and reports
serve as self-ethnographies, offering insights into environmental
adaptation in the high north. These sources also shed light on the
livelihoods of Arctic Indigenous communities and the relations between
them and polar scientists. Materials related to the Soviet settler
colonisation of the Arctic and Indigenous people were collected in the
State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) in Moscow.

#### Settler adaptation perpetuates colonialism by using Indigenous people in the Arctic to figure out the ideal conditions of their land later to extract the materials, instrumentalizing them for geopolitical purposes.

2.3. 'Weathering' Indigenous

[Before Soviet colonisation of the Arctic, most of the islands remained
uninhabited due to their harsh climatic conditions. However, some, like
Novaya Zemlya and Vaygach Island, were seasonally visited by Indigenous
populations as part of their annual nomadic cycles.]{.underline} In
additon, a few Nenets families had been living permanently in Novaya
Zemlya since at least the nineteenth century. These nomadic pastoralist
communities, including the Nenets, Even, Tundra Chukchi, Koryak,
Yukaghir, Tundra Enets, and Nganasan, along with the semi-nomadic marine
hunting groups such as the Chukchi, Asiatic Yupik, and Aleut, were
officially recognised as Indigenous under the Soviet nationality policy
of the 1920s. These communities represented a special interest for the
Soviet state during its industrialisation campaign in the north. **[As
Yuri Slezkine (1994, p. 138) emphasises, they were key to the 'economic
development of almost one-third of the country's territory.' The Arctic
is a region of enormous animal and mineral wealth, yet only the
well-adapted Indigenous populations were considered capable of fully
exploiting these resources. If these native communities were to
disappear, this potentially prosperous land would risk becoming nothing
more than a 'frozen wasteland']{.underline}** (Slezkine, 1994, p. 138).
The task of support and preservation of Indigenous people was identified
by the Supreme Council for National Economy as 'a matter of great
national importance' (1925, GARF, P3977-2-30; see also Mamontova, 2023).

As the Soviet government worked to establish permanent populations on
the islands to assert its claims over these Arctic territories,
[Indigenous people were particularly recognised for their remarkable
adaptability to local weather conditions.]{.underline} [Their endurance
and resilience in dealing with extreme weather conditions, in tandem
with exceptional navigation skills, were appreciated by polar
scientists]{.underline}. **[Significant attention was given to
Indigenous weather knowledge systems, specifically those of the Chukchi
and Yupik peoples in the Arctic]{.underline}** (see Bogoslavskaya &
Krupnik, 2013; Kolomiets & Krupnik, 2020; Krupnik et al., 2010).
Indigenous community members made substantial contributions to
understanding and predicting weather, sea ice behaviour, and currents in
the Arctic Ocean, based on their profound navigation skills in open
waters and deep knowledge of the migrations of birds and sea mammals.
These skills formed the body of traditional Indigenous knowledge, which
can be broadly defined as 'a network of knowledges, beliefs, and
traditions intended to preserve, communicate, and contextualize
Indigenous relationships with culture and landscape over time' (Bruchac,
2014, p. 3814). During the early Soviet period of colonisation, due to
these abilities, **[Indigenous community members were considered
instrumental, and Soviet authorities were inclined to exploit their
adaptive abilities to navigate changing weather patterns for their own
benefit.]{.underline}**

The Indigenous people's techniques for moving through the unfamiliar
surroundings of the Arctic tundra during adverse weather conditions were
reported as particularly valuable. Indeed, the nomadic lifestyles of
hunting and reindeer herding communities require a combination of
detailed geographic knowledge and expert navigation skills to adapt to
various environmental challenges. For example, in Inuit geography,
horizons and geographical features are oriented using wind rather than
cardinal points (Aporta, 2005). Similarly, among the Nenets, a variety
of navigational methods are employed, including cardinal directions,
based on observations of wind speed and direction, snow cover, shapes of
plants, and animal activities (Adaev, 2018). The head of the expedition
in the Gyda tundra, B. N. Gorodkov, noted that the landscape of the
tundra was rather monotonous for an inexperienced traveller and to avoid
getting lost, 'one must either be a Samoyed or constantly keep an eye on
the compass' (Tobolyakov, 1931, p. 52). His Nenets guide and translator,
the shaman Pron'ka Nenyang (Komarov), skilfully utilised sastrugi
\[irregular ridges of hard snow formed by wind erosion\] as landmarks.
In his field diary, Gorodkov reported that 'due to the prevailing winds,
they \[sastrugi\], like a compass arrow, were almost always oriented in
the same direction in the tundra. Pron'ka noted the angle at which he
set off and then did not change this angle. In addition, he observed the
bushes, pitifully protruding from under the snow. On the leeside,
icicles hung from the bushes, and similar to snow drifts, they helped
him to maintain his direction' (Tobolyakov, 1930, p. 21). Where Russian
scholars struggled with the wind, Indigenous guides, drawing from their
knowledge and experience, were believed to know how to effectively deal
with diverse climatic conditions. This was well summarised by
topographer and geographer Vladimir Arsenyev in his famous book about
his long-term relationship with the Nanai guide Dersu Uzala: 'In
relation to a person, nature is unforgiving. After a brief caress, it
suddenly attacks, almost intentionally revealing his \[the person's\]
helplessness. The traveller constantly has to deal with the natural
phenomena, such as rain, wind, flooding, mosquitoes, swamps, cold, snow,
etc. Furthermore, the forest itself is an environmental force. Dersu, in
accordance with his surroundings, was more in tune \[with these
conditions\] than us' (Arsenyev, \[1923\] 2010, p. 104).

**[The Soviet polar scientists' reliance on the weather-wise abilities
of Indigenous communities can be understood as part of a racialised
colonial logic, where Indigenous peoples were both idealised for their
perceived connection to the environment and instrumentalised for the
state's geopolitical objectives]{.underline}** (cf. Livingstone, 2018).
Simultaneously, this perception arose from the polar scientists'
difficulties in fully adapting to the Arctic environment and their
recognition of the Indigenous peoples' expertise and mastery. Thus, in
his report, the head of the Northern Hydrographic Expedition,
Matusevich, noted that the significance of the meteorological station at
Matochkin Shar had been confirmed 'as a centre of colonisation, towards
which the sparse population, attracted to the eastern side of Novaya
Zemlya by fishing, would inevitably gravitate' (1925, GARF,
Р3977--1--50, p. 2). Matusevich used the term 'gravitation' to describe
the Nenets' interest in polar stations as potential hubs for trade and
exchange. After the destruction of trading posts established during the
Tsarist era, the supply issue in the tundra became critical. **[Polar
stations became a means of settler-colonisation, addressing these
critical supply challenges in the Arctic.]{.underline}** Matusevich
pointed out that all winter camps of the Nenets people were located on
the western shore of Novaya Zemlya, meaning that their nomadic trails to
the eastern shore did not often pass through the station. He concluded
that this factor needed to be considered when establishing new stations
to address the issue of the colonisation of Novaya Zemlya and
surrounding areas (1925, GARF, Р3977--1--50, p. 2). Evidently, the focus
on Indigenous communities near the station was connected to the need to
establish a lasting human population in this vast archipelago, with
Indigenous people seen as particularly suitable due to their
environmental knowledge and adaptability.

#### Indigenous bodies are used for territorial extraction of the Arctic -- that's the only way they are recognized; their bodies are used as a way to determine what they can extract geographically and then displacing Indigenous them for to gain political control over the Arctic.

5\. Conclusion As Mahony and Endfield (2018) argue, **[imperial
ambitions have long been entangled with climate---its perception,
control, and governance. In settler-colonial contexts, meteorological
governance functions as a crucial tool for territorialisation,
population control, and resource extraction]{.underline}** (Mercer &
Simpson, 2023). [This paper demonstrates that in the Soviet Arctic,
meteorological stations were not merely sites for collecting
climate-related data; they were central to the Soviet settler colonial
project in the region.]{.underline} **[Acting as the 'eyes and ears' of
the state, these stations facilitated both environmental and
socio-political surveillance,]{.underline}** consolidating Soviet
frontiers and embedding state authority in sparsely populated areas.
**[These policies were deeply intertwined with resource extraction,
Indigenous policies, and the assertion of political control over the
Arctic atmosphere itself]{.underline}**. Controlled from Moscow,
meteorological stations played a key role in regulating the Soviet
Union's resource-based economy, thereby extending state power across
vast territories. [Beyond their economic and geopolitical functions,
they also contributed to shaping the 'polar imagination' of Soviet
citizens---an imagination built around narratives of conquest,
endurance, and the struggle against nature.]{.underline}

**[In advancing its territorial ambitions, the Soviet state valued
Indigenous peoples for their perceived adaptability to the Arctic's
harsh conditions and romanticised them as naturally suited to extreme
climates]{.underline}**. **[Interactions between polar scientists,
Indigenous communities, and the volatile Arctic environment influenced
Soviet policies, wherein Indigenous 'physical and cultural
traits'---interpreted through the racialised geographical imaginations
of polar scientists (Legg, 2020)--- were exploited to justify Indigenous
participation in Soviet colonial expansion.]{.underline}**

While meteorological governance has historically been used to exploit
Indigenous populations in various colonial contexts (e.g., Jankovi´ c,
2015; Livingstone, 2002), Soviet meteorological stations played a
distinct role as gravitational points for Indigenous communities.
Positioned strategically along nomadic routes, these stations helped
fill the void left by the absence of tsarist trading posts, acting as
fixed points within a fluid landscape. They facilitated trade and
exchange, reinforcing Soviet presence and subtly advancing colonial
agendas and assimilationist policies. Over time, these stations evolved
into instruments of geopolitical control, asserting volumetric
territorial sovereignty and integrating Indigenous populations into
state administrative, political, and economic structures in the north,
where they were increasingly regarded as 'valuable elements' of the
state apparatus. Indigenous knowledge of climate adaptation, developed
over generations, was framed as an essential asset within Soviet
colonisation efforts.

In contrast to other settler-colonial contexts, where Indigenous peoples
were progressively erased or displaced (Hughes, 2020; Velednitsky et
al., 2020), Soviet authorities classified Indigenous peoples as
'colonists' alongside non-Indigenous settlers, which set Soviet Arctic
governance apart. This classification was not merely rhetorical; it
functioned as a mechanism for incorporating Indigenous communities into
the Soviet modernist project while reinforcing state control over
northern populations and territories. The concept of 'Indigenous' in the
Soviet Union was territorially bound to the northward expansion of the
Russian state and recognised mainly Arctic and Siberian peoples as
Indigenous, while excluding most ethnic minorities in European Russia
and Central Asia---despite their historical territorial ties
(Stammler-Grossmann, 2009). This territorialised approach to
Indigeneity, deeply embedded in Soviet policies, continues to shape
contemporary Russian Indigenous policies.

Within the framework of meteorological governance, Soviet colonial
policies evolved toward large-scale acclimatisation efforts, exemplified
by the 1930s mass acclimatisation projects in the north (Arzyutov,
2023). With the Arctic's sparse population, state authorities sought a
workforce suited to extreme conditions, positioning Indigenous peoples,
seen as 'naturally suited' to the harsh climate, as central agents of
Soviet territorial consolidation. Over time, this objective expanded
beyond Indigenous labour to include forced Gulag labour and university
graduate distribution policies (Josephson, 2014). Alongside these
settler-colonial strategies, the Soviet state also pursued more
ambitious political goals, seeking to not only acclimate settlers to the
Arctic but to transform the polar atmosphere itself, making it more
hospitable for future generations of settler colonists. This vision of
the Arctic as a space to be mastered and controlled has been promoted
throughout the Soviet era and continues to inform Russian Arctic policy
today.

**[The perpetual instability of the Arctic atmosphere influenced Soviet
approaches to Indigenous nomadic populations, whose mobility
increasingly came to be seen as a challenge to state control in remote
areas. Rather than removing nomadic groups, Soviet authorities sought to
'fix' them in place, aligning with broader efforts to 'stabilise' the
Arctic itself through environmental interventions]{.underline}**. This
governance strategy was integral to the wider sedentarisation policies
aimed at transforming Indigenous livelihoods to fit the Soviet vision of
fixed, governable frontiers. Rather than viewing the Arctic as a
volatile frontier, this policy sought to render both its landscapes and
inhabitants predictable and controllable. Although technological
advancements reduced Soviet dependence on Indigenous knowledge, the
ideological framing of Indigenous communities as uniquely adapted to
Arctic life persisted. This racialised image remains a key element in
post-Soviet Arctic policy, particularly in relation to contemporary
Russian approaches to Indigenous peoples and their perceived
adaptability to climate change.

Neoliberal hope

There is a large body of critical scholarship that has demonstrated the
ways in which neoliberal rationality has insinuated itself in all
spheres of life. [Neoliberal market logic has come to prevail, and
economic parameters have entered discussions from global development to
education and personal health. **With neoliberalism, values such as
competition, capacity-building, privatisation and responsibilisation
have become normalised**]{.underline}. The focus is not only on strictly
monetary profit, but on managing an entire society through these values
(e.g. Larner and Walters 2004; Walters 2012; Brown 2015). As part of the
neoliberal move, the "private" has gained an increasing role while the
"public" has lost much of its relevance; this has seen the state
withdrawing from its previous responsibilities to provide security and
well-being. It is now up to the active individual to secure his or her
life and to be "entrepreneurial" (e.g. Agrawal 2005; Chandler and Reid
2016; Larner 2005; Li 2007, 2014).

**[Indigenous--state relations have not been spared neoliberal
rationality]{.underline}** (e.g. Howard-Wagner, Bargh and
Altamirano-Jiménez 2018). On the contrary, to a growing extent these
relations have become defined by a market logic of profitability and
cost-effectiveness[**. Generally speaking, the recent willingness of
states to start drafting contracts with indigenous peoples can be
attributed to the states' interests in natural resources.**
Historically, as often today, indigenous peoples have lived in
territories with abundant resources. The increasing scarcity of certain
natural resources and the opportunities provided by climate change have
only heightened the external pressure to extract resources from
indigenous lands.]{.underline} **[The shrinking Arctic ice cap, the
scramble for accessible resources and the challenging position of Arctic
indigenous peoples combine to form a case in point]{.underline}** (e.g.
Guerrieri 2019; Nuttall 2017; Sejersen 2020).

**[Although states' efforts to meet indigenous peoples halfway might at
a first glance appear to be a sincere interest in promoting the people's
rights, their ultimate motive in doing so lies elsewhere.]{.underline}**
A recent strand of critical scholarship has pointed out how the
processes of negotiation and contractuality are driven by neoliberal
parameters that deeply affect state policies and preferences. For
example, Ronald Niezen (2017), in studying the changes in the political
climate of **[Canada,]{.underline}** points to the clash of expectations
and reality. He notes how the **[government's shift towards more
indigenous-friendly politics aroused expectations of "sweeping
reforms]{.underline}**" (Niezen 2017, 162). In his critical account, he
argues that these expectations were highly unfounded, reaching the
following conclusion:

The extent to which the government of a country with a national economy
based largely on extractive industries could rapidly and thoroughly
overhaul its policies toward indigenous peoples should probably been in
doubt from the outset. (Niezen 2017, 162)

Indeed, **[despite the symbolic and rhetorical changes in state
practices, the marketand profit-driven underpinning of indigenous--state
relations remains unchanged.]{.underline}**

In another study on Canada, [Emilie Cameron (2015) problematises the
land claim agreement processes between the state and indigenous peoples.
Her book Far Off Metal River: Inuit Lands, Settler Stories, and the
Making of the Contemporary Arctic (2015) delves into the economic and
colonial exploitation of indigenous lands. **She rejects the assumption
that land claim agreements are the solution to
decolonisation**.]{.underline} **[As she puts it, these agreements are
but tools through which the state operationalises its agenda. While
indigenous peoples are parties to these negotiations, they are the only
parties having to make trade-offs.]{.underline}** In Cameron's (2015,
18) **[words, "the agreements require Indigenous signatories to formally
cede their claims to the land in exchange for specific types of
compensation". The idea here, one according with the neoliberal logic of
cost-effectiveness, is that past injustices will be dealt with,
corrected and compensated only once. Indigenous peoples are thus assumed
to be able to put a "price tag" on their loss and
dispossession.]{.underline}** As Colin Samson and Elizabeth Cassell
note, when it comes to land rights and compensation, indigenous peoples
often "are hardly in a commanding position to question a land claims
agreement, especially when that agreement promises them immediate,
albeit temporary, cash relief" (Samson and Cassell 2013, 51). If the
peoples fail to price their dispossession in "justifiable" terms or do
not agree to the conditions set before them, they risk losing state
care, compensation and recognition altogether.

To a growing extent, states are not the only operators on the lands that
indigenous peoples have traditionally occupied. The neoliberal drive for
privatisation has taken over, and states also have their role in pushing
such development. As Deirdre Howard-Wagner, Maria Bargh and Isabel
Altamirano-Jiménez (2018, 16) note in their book on neoliberal state
recognition and indigenous rights, "government policies actively
encourage private-public partnerships with industry, assuming indigenous
communities and industry are equal". Colin Samson (2016) has observed a
similar development towards privatisation. His nuanced analysis focuses
on Comprehensive Land Claims processes in Canada and their ramifications
for indigenous communities and their economic position. He notes how,
instead of the communities themselves being beneficiaries of those
processes, it is largely the resource extraction companies and
non-indigenous workers who ultimately benefit. Samson's research urges
us to view the land claims processes critically in the light of
neoliberal governance. He specifies the nature of the processes as
follows:

[By presenting extractive industries as providers of money and jobs to
Aboriginal populations, attention is easily deflected from the
disproportionate gains they make from the transfer of collective to fee
simple ownership.]{.underline} **[Less attention is also devoted to the
adulteration of the natural ecologies that indigenous histories,
communities and economies have been built upon, signalling that it is
not only land dispossession, but cultural dispossession]{.underline}**.
(Samson 2016, 99)

**[Indeed, there is a paradoxical relation between rights and neoliberal
marketisation. The state-granted rights, namely, land rights, which are
assumed to provide security for the peoples, their cultures and lands,
have led to a situation that actually opens up these lands and cultures
to business interests.]{.underline}** Without question, indigenous
communities should have equal opportunities to benefit from the
resources. However, the starting points for "doing business" are not
necessarily favourable to indigenous peoples. As Howard-Wagner, Bargh
and Altamirano-Jiménez (2018, 16) point out, neoliberal privatisation
does not take into consideration the significance of past and present
"processes of land dispossession".

In a similar structural critique, Elizabeth Gail Russell (2015) points
out how, once "settled" in the eyes of the states, rights and contracts
impact future possibilities. If indigenous peoples express
dissatisfaction with developments that occur after a contract has been
made, any debate can only take place within the limits and possibilities
of the contract itself. Indigenous--state relations become encapsulated
in the contract and issues beyond or around it remain off-limits.
Russell also sees contract-making between indigenous peoples and states
as highly neoliberal in focus, that is, as serving state and corporate
interests.

The question of dispossession brings forth the connection between
neoliberalism and colonialism. **[Cameron's (2015) work, in particular,
highlights the role that land claim agreements play in sustaining
colonial relations]{.underline}**. [Her critique targets the structures
created following these agreements, asserting that they enable colonial
and neoliberal governance. Summarising her argument, she states that the
institutions established through land claim agreements often reinforce
and perpetuate colonial relations. **They also, as is clear in Nunavut
today, facilitate and accelerate the accumulation of capital by
formalizing title to Indigenous lands and implementing property and
governance regimes that enable resource extraction.**]{.underline}
(Cameron 2015, 18--19)

Ultimately, what calls for critique is the often unseen connection
between rights, neoliberalism and colonialism. As noted in Chapter 4 on
contractuality, rights do not always bring justice. The same logic
applies in the case of rights pertaining to resources and economic
profit. Rights do, however, engender hopes. In the context of indigenous
peoples and land rights, those hopes centre on economic security,
employment and wealth. One of the key hopes of the peoples is regaining
control of their lands. How and whether these hopes eventually
materialise is another question as the critical discussion also
demonstrates.

Ghassan Hage (2003; 2009), studying the functions of hope in capitalist
societies, points out the uneasy position of hope in neoliberalism. His
book Against Paranoid Nationalism. Searching for Hope in a Shrinking
Society (2003) delves into the profound inequality that exists in
capitalist societies and into the ways in which those societies
distribute hope. When taken to the extreme, as Hage (2003, 17) argues,
"certain groups are not offered any hope at all". The capitalist and
neoliberal state that rations hope provides it unequally and leaves some
without it altogether, produces uncertainty, dissatisfaction and
instability. In Hage's words (2003, 20), "\[a\]s the state withdraws
from society and the existing configuration of hope begins shrinking,
many people, \[...\] have begun suffering various forms of hope
scarcity". This loss of societal hope leads to "paranoid nationalism" --
a state where "no-hopers" experience "a sense of entrapment, of having
nowhere to go" (Hage 2003, 20, 21). Hage also makes an insightful
observation on how, due to history, hope or hopefulness have a different
relevance for different groups of peoples. He specifically recognises
the difference between indigenous peoples and their historically limited
hopes and the newly emerged scarcity of hope affecting other groups. As
he puts it:

They \[the newly marginalised\] join the already overmarginalised
populations of indigenous communities, homeless people, poor immigrant
workers, and the chronically unemployed. But like these groups, the
newly marginalised are not used to their state of marginality. They are
not used to being denied a share of hope by society. So they don't know
how to dig for new forms of hope. (Hage 2003, 20--21)

**[In Hage's view, the political distribution of hope is tied to the
neoliberal logic of cost-effectiveness]{.underline}**. For the
neoliberal state, it might not be "profitable" to give out hope
endlessly or in equal shares -- as if a certain amount of hope scarcity
would encourage individuals to be more active and entrepreneurial.

The distribution of hope is strongly intertwined with the promises of
economic rewards. In her study on the role of hope for the Zapatista
struggle in Mexico, Lia Haro (2010) discusses the prevailing political
economic logic of "if, then". She summarises it as follows:

If you allow us free economic reign and ensure ideal business
conditions, then you can hope for improvement and overcome social ills
enough to take advantages of enormous opportunities that we offer to
you. [As many communities in the Global South have learned, the
achievement of that dream requires the pawning of human lives, land and
resources to corporations that 'invest' in development while extracting
significant profit of their own and maintaining the social relations
intact that serve the freedom of capital \[...\] Here, the 'poor' and
'minorities' may hope, within the terms and practices prescribed, for
the 'better' world defined by institutions \[...\]. (Haro 2010,
191)]{.underline}

Haro continues by noting that this form of "hegemonic hope" does not
disturb the wealth and political position of the elite. In other words,
neoliberally engineered hope works for the benefit of the prevailing
political and economic order. At the same time, by signalling hope for
wealth and improvements to those who have less, it furthers their
dispossession

**[Contemporary indigenous--state relations can thus be described as a
meshing of colonial mentalities, neoliberal rationalities and politics
of hope]{.underline}**. The impact of neoliberal parameters becomes
visible in the ways in which resource debates, privatisation and
cost-effectiveness define contract-making between indigenous peoples and
states. It is assumed that the peoples can enter into these agreements
on an equal footing with states and the business sector, yet this
assumption reflects the persistence of colonial structures and the
historical amnesia regarding the significance that the past has for the
present. At the same time, the right of indigenous peoples to become
part of market-driven resource politics is presented as a source of hope
(see also Guerrieri 2019). However, yet again, hopes in this regard are
directed towards the future and, as the critical scholarship
demonstrates, realising these hopes can be extremely complicated. Hence,
the seeming abundance of hope entailed in neoliberal relations between
indigenous peoples and states actually produces a scarcity of hope as it
limits the peoples' room for manoeuvre. For those indigenous peoples who
are in dire need of economic support, the cash relief promised by the
business sector is difficult to pass. This is further accentuated in
situations where states have devolved some of their authority to the
peoples and, accordingly, withdrawn from some of their earlier
responsibilities to provide services and support. The state-induced
expectation is that the peoples should manage their own affairs in this
neoliberal equation. Here one would do well to ask, which hopes and
whose hopes does this setting serve?

Hopeful care

As we see it, an aspect of care has entered into contemporary
indigenous--state relations. [**States have adopted a more inclusive,
embracing and concerned mentality in response to the** criticism that
they have received **for their previous policies and actions towards
indigenous peoples**. States' willingness to initiate truth and
reconciliation processes, to offer apologies and to increasingly
recognise the peoples' rights **all point to well-meaning care for
them**]{.underline}. This newly emerged will to care has been also taken
as a signal of hope. Clearly, care -- as a mode of behaviour -- stands
in stark contrast to previous state policies. As the shift to care from
what was in many cases eradication has been much desired, this
transition has received far less critical attention. We argue that
illuminating the dynamics of care in indigenous--state relations is
crucial to understanding the operation of hope in these relations.

The logic behind states' care is that indigenous peoples and their
causes matter and that they have been acknowledged. [Even if a state is
"not-yet" able to address or correct the injustices faced by the
peoples, there is promise that it will do so in the (near)
future.]{.underline} Truth and reconciliation processes have been widely
perceived as gestures of care and genuine attempts on the part of states
to atone for their colonial deeds. [Words such as "healing" and
"redress" readily appear in the context of these processes, where the
aim is to openly discuss and document the injustices suffered by the
victims of the colonial state.]{.underline} The underlying principle is
that after the process, the indigenous people in question, and the
society at large -- the state included -- may move forward and establish
a healthy relationship. The truth and reconciliation processes between
states and indigenous peoples that have been initiated and completed
amply exemplify this mentality (e.g. Kuokkanen 2020; Niezen 2017; Regan
2011).

[Canada has pioneered state-led reconciliation efforts]{.underline}.
From 2008 to 2015, the country went through a truth and reconciliation
process focused on its residential school history. While the state
invested time and financial resources in the process, significant
questions have remained as to how the knowledge and experience gathered
will affect the future relations of indigenous peoples and the rest of
the society. Offering a profound critique of the process, Ronal Niezen
(2017) questions the principles on which the work of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission was built. In his book Truth and Indignation:
Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Indian Residential
Schools (2017), Niezen criticises, for example, the victim-centred
approach of the process and the way in which the state distanced itself
from the process. A process that was presented as a sign of care and as
a way towards improved relations between indigenous peoples and state
produced, in many ways, the opposite outcome. As Niezen (2017, 20)
points out, the mandate of the commission was quite limited from the
very outset. Only certain educational institutions were included, and in
encouraging particular kinds of narratives the process left out others.
In other words, the commission sought only particular truths and
testimonies. One consequence of the process centring on the victims is
that it left out the structural basis of harms done. In Niezen's words,

we hear a great deal about the pain, struggle, and redemption that
characterize a particular type of survivor experience, while our
knowledge of the "perpetrators," their motives, and the institutions
that harboured them are left obscured. (Niezen 2017, 168--169)

Niezen (2017, 169) continues, asserting that this focus on survivors and
the limited mandate of the commission led to its being "unable to
effectively function with reference to the actual causes of warped
disciplinarity, the sources of misguided policies that were the
immediate source of the collective harm it sought to address". Indeed,
**[as the fundamental structures of the colonial state were left
unqueried, Niezen concludes that the promise of genuine and lasting
reconciliation was not fulfilled.]{.underline}**

[Finland has also taken steps towards reconciliation with the Sámi
people, in response to an initiative put forward by the Sámi
Parliament]{.underline}. [The proposal for a truth and reconciliation
commission was approved by the Sámi Parliament and the Skolt Sámi
Village Committee in 2019 and the election of commissioners is underway
at the time of writing this book]{.underline}. The aim of the process is
to recognise and assess historical and present discrimination, including
efforts by the state to assimilate the Sámi. In addition, the commission
is tasked with looking for ways to improve the relations between the
Sámi and the state of Finland. The commission's mandate explicitly
states that as a result of the process "Finland will bear its
responsibility" and, in collaboration with the Sámi, "will strengthen
the fulfilment of the rights of the Sámi" (Saamelaisten totuus- ja
sovintokomission asettaminen 2019, 3). It is worth noting here that the
truth and reconciliation process is linked to the question of the
ratification of ILO Convention 169. Rauna Kuokkanen (2020) offers a
critical assessment of the points of departure in the process.
**[Echoing Niezen's observation, she questions the extent to which the
structural basis of contemporary Sámi--state relations allows genuine
reconciliation. Summarising the concerns of the Sámi, she
asks:]{.underline}**

**[How can we trust the state as a party to reconciliation while for the
past several years, it has been backtracking on (already limited) Sámi
rights, legislation and established state obligations toward the Sámi?
How can the state genuinely engage in reconciliation while pushing for
aggressive and extensive land use and development plans considered
detrimental to the interests of the Sámi, particularly to traditional
livelihoods?]{.underline}** (Kuokkanen 2020, 294)

**[Kuokkanen concludes that without substantial structural
transformation in the relations between the Sámi and the state, the
truth and reconciliation process has slim chances of success. To judge
from existing relations and their biased grounds, the process will only
serve to perpetuate colonialism]{.underline}** in Finland Providing an
account of the question of reconciliation in international relations at
large, Catherine Lu (2017, 200) notes how "\[s\]tructural dignity is a
fundamental prerequisite of a just social structure and an objective
component of structural reconciliation". Indeed, the reorganisation of
indigenous--state relations that purportedly takes place through
reconciliation requires a thorough and honest assessment of how and why
these relations are what they are today. That reconciliation processes
have been conducted is no evidence that they drew on such a structural
evaluation; rather, they seem to be essentially one-off processes
through which the states can convey the message of an issue being
"settled", once and for all (see also Niezen 2017). **[In this respect,
the idea of care that is embedded in reconciliation is
misleading,]{.underline}** as the processes largely betoken piecemeal
attention to issues that the states have been willing to address. Issues
that are too complex or compromise state interests have been overlooked,
despite their significance to the indigenous peoples in question.

Critical legal scholarship has also observed the structural foundations
of the exclusion of indigenous peoples. For example, Kathleen Birrell
(2016), Irene Watson (2015) and Stephen Young (2020) have revealed the
colonial basis of rights and legal institutions. In her book
Indigeneity: Before and Beyond the Law (2016), Birrell notes how there
is a certain type of indigenous subject that the law constructs and
requires as needing protection. For those recognised as indigenous and
in need of protection, as she points out, state recognition is
"violently determinative" in the moment when indigeneity is recognised
(Birrell 2016, 16). Here "violence" refers to the need law has to
categorise the indigenous as Other and to expect authenticity of it.
Ultimately then, as Birrell argues, the attempts of indigenous peoples
to gain justice through Western law are extremely difficult. Along
similar lines, Irene Watson (2015; 2017) demonstrates how in Australia
settler law has been, and still is, a vehicle through which the
colonising project has been advanced and normalised. Reflecting on the
question of claiming rights, Young (2020, 19) also notes the problems
endemic to state-created legal systems. [In his words, by taking part in
these legal frameworks an indigenous subject becomes "identifiable as a
legal subject who has, whether one intends to or not, already professed
obedience to the powers that one conscripts". Through law, the peoples
become agents and objects of oppression at the same time**. For
indigenous peoples, claiming rights within the Western legal domain is
thus a double-edged sword**]{.underline}.

**[As indicated above, if indigenous peoples are to be recognised in the
eyes of the law, the expectation is that they will represent themselves
in a recognisable manner. Only in this way can the peoples be recognised
as legal subjects and worthy of the state's care. Such care is limited,
however, as it only recognises indigenous subjects as either
authentically indigenous or as victims. Such a biased setting derives
from Western and colonial law being founded by the states and thus
favourable to their worldview and aspirations.]{.underline}** Overall,
what we see is an uneasy "fit" between indigenous peoples and their
claims and states' regimes of recognition and redress. Even though there
is a tendency to think that law is neutral in its pursuit of justice,
it, too, has its colonial heritage.

**[In Life Beside Itself: Imagining Care in the Canadian Arctic, Lisa
Stevenson (2014) adds another layer to the critical discussion on
continuing colonial practices and the allegedly well-meaning care of
states for indigenous peoples. Delving into the topic of welfare, she
traces the ways in which welfare colonialism has appeared over time in
Canada's policies towards the Inuit]{.underline}**. Her particular focus
is care and how it operates in governing development. Offering a
biopolitical analysis of the tuberculosis epidemic in the 1950s and
1960s and of the current suicide crisis in Inuit communities, Stevenson
demonstrates how the state's care is indifferent. **[Taking this
argument further, she calls the care received by the Inuit
"murderous".]{.underline}** As her nuanced analysis reveals, the Inuit
have been included in the state's anonymous and bureaucratic care, which
is only interested in keeping the Inuit alive. This care works, as
Stevenson (2014, 73) puts it "to maintain the physical life of Inuit qua
Canadian citizens**[". At the same time, it represents "murderous
indifference", because the state and its agencies "promote cooperation
in a regime of life, but they also expect that Inuit will
fail]{.underline}**" (Stevenson 2014, 73**[). In this mode of caring
"the death of the tubercular or the suicidal Inuk comes as no surprise"
(]{.underline}**Stevenson 2014, 7). **[The care, which in Stevenson's
(2014, 4) words is "couched by the state in terms of benevolence and
concern" is, in effect, an outright expectation that the Inuit will fail
to live.]{.underline}** Here one sees welfare mechanisms, whose express
purpose is to provide care, overlook indigenous peoples' needs. [All in
all, Stevenson's study demonstrates the way in which state care
continues to be destructively colonial, even in the intimate spheres of
healthcare and suicide prevention]{.underline}.

**[Indeed, care has unintended consequences, much like hope
has]{.underline}**. Miriam Ticktin (2011) also takes up the troubling
aspects of care in her book Casualties of Care: Immigration and the
Politics of Humanitarianism in France. Drawing on a broader discussion
on humanitarian immigration, she argues that certain groups of people
become "casualties of care". Her analysis focuses on asylum seekers and
the way in which they have to "earn" the care of the state through
biological suffering. As Ticktin demonstrates, the racialised
postcolonial nation state has deep roots. This becomes particularly
evident when the only way for asylum seekers to gain access to the
services of the state is suffering -- providing evidence of sickness,
disability or being victims of violence. In the state's politics of
care, such victimhood follows subjects for they become visible only as
gendered and racialised victims who can never be equal (Ticktin 2011).
While Ticktin's account does not address indigenous peoples, a similar
logic of partial recognition and colonial structures is at play.

The intentions of states to care for indigenous peoples appear
problematic, whether one looks at the issue from the perspective of
politics, law or welfare.

**[State-provided care tends to signal hope for the better, but when one
scratches the promising surface, the less heartening colonial
foundations become evident. The very care that was meant to heal and
renew indigenous--state relations is dangerous.]{.underline}** Elizabeth
Povinelli (2011) builds a similar type of argument in her work Economies
of Abandonment. Social Belonging and Endurance in Late Liberalism.
Weaving together questions of liberal recognition, a promise of care and
the conditions of Aboriginal people in Australia, she illustrates the
contemporary functioning of abandonment. Povinelli captures the core
problem in state efforts to care for the colonised when she asks, "What
does care consist of such that when a form of creating harm for others
is thought of and experienced as a form of caring for others?"
(Povinelli 2011, 58). As she then demonstrates, for indigenous peoples
in Australia, such care has only brought on calls for endurance and
resulted in the peoples being abandoned by the state. The seemingly
benevolent deeds of the state under the guise of care have meant that
the peoples must "persist in potentiality" (Povinelli 2011, 128).
Povinelli elaborates the point, saying "that they will have to live with
less now in order to live with more in the future, or that their present
deaths are actually a future redemption" (Povinelli 2011, 99). Our
perception of hope and its political valence resonates with Povinelli's
idea of waiting and "persisting in potentiality", as they share the same
elements of a future orientation and promise of a future reward The
above engagement with critical scholarship demonstrates that where
indigenous peoples and the structural foundations of colonialism are
concerned, care and hope are entwined. [Hope is not far removed from the
promises of care, and acts of care reproduce hope]{.underline}. [As we
argue, the colonial state has succeeded in harnessing this dynamic of
hopeful care for its benefit]{.underline}. In providing more or less
explicit expressions of its willingness to care, a state can be seen as
implementing a politics of hope that enables it to extend its rule over
indigenous peoples, once again. This is illustrated both in the states'
power to decide the timing and the extent of the legal, political or
social care they dispense and in their authority to not alter the
colonial structure of their institutions of care. [The cruel dynamics of
state care leads us to ponder the question, if and when care can be
murderous, can hope be lethal]{.underline}? Biopolitical scholarship, in
general, has brought to the fore the ways in which care is harnessed for
the exercise of governmental power. Indeed, part of contemporary
politics is that we are "cared to death" (Dillon 2005). **[As we see it,
hope and the politics of hope are part and parcel of this continuum of
state care.]{.underline}** In the case of indigenous peoples and their
rights, the entanglement of care and hope becomes particularly critical
as the two are located within the boundaries of colonial
intelligibility: care and hope have a particular meaning in the language
that colonial states speak. **[Consequently, the care and hope that the
peoples receive remain within the confines of the state's colonial
structures.]{.underline}**

### Alt -- Combat Breath

#### The Alternative is a violent challenging of normative and popular understandings of the colonialized and black body through the combat breath

Fanon repeatedly articulates this antagonistic relationship as if he
wants to split asunder the dominant and normative belief that slavery
and colonialism consolidate politics to fit all desires and serve the
interests of all.

Instead, Fanon argues **[that slavery and colonialism create in the
native a tendency towards violence, a 'tonicity of muscles' deprived of
an outlet]{.underline}**. On both personal and social registers**[, men
can free themselves socio-ontologically once this violence is
expressed:]{.underline}** 'For the native, life can only spring up again
out of the rotting corpse of the settler' (Fanon 1952: 43). He adds:

The mobilization of the masses, when it arises out of the war of
liberation, introduces into each man's consciousness the ideas of a
common cause, a national destiny and of a collective history. In the
same way the second phase, that of building up the nation is helped by
the existence of this cement which has been mixed with blood and anger.
(Fanon 1952: 83)

Fanon disrupts the dominant idea that the colonised are dominated by
contingent machinations of the state and war. He argues that **[natives
and blackness are constituted by violence ontologically in the first
instance.]{.underline}** So politics for Fanon is a politics of
ontology. In my view, his philosophical gesture is not arbitrary or
necessarily metaphysical in the modern sense; thus, he insists on
talking about the slave and the colonised and the tensions that emerge
in the erection of the species and the flesh. **[When he mentions the
native's life springing up from 'the rotting corpse of the settler', he
not only incites violence by employing its grammar but also challenges
the normative and popular understandings of the materiality of violence
and our understanding the body itself]{.underline}**. In effect, in
explaining what 'combat breath' is in the everyday struggles against the
coloniser whose project is the final destruction of the colonised, he is
also able to point to the reasons why combat breathing enables
alternative worlds and worldviews.

**[There is not occupation of territory, on the one hand, and
independence of persons on the other. It is the country as a whole, its
history, its daily pulsation that are contested, disfigured, in the hope
of a final destruction. Under these conditions, the individual's
breathing is an observed, an occupied breathing. It is a combat
breathing.]{.underline}** From this point on, the real values of the
occupied quickly tend to acquire a clandestine form of existence. In the
presence of the occupier, the occupied learns to dissemble, to resort to
trickery. (Fanon 1967c: 65)

Anaximenes said**[: 'It is breathing, not simple air, that
individualizes the human being, that gives him or her subjectivity, and
that ultimately constitutes his or her soul. Such an activity of
breathing provides physiological as well as psychological, physical as
well as spiritual life;]{.underline}** and in this sense, more than a
material element (as air is), pneuma is a force, a life-force' (quoted
in Benso 2008: 14). What politics can empty this life force? If pneuma,
air, and psyche 'interact and feed each other \... \[and\] each
nourishes the other' (Anaximenes quoted in Benso 2008: 16), **[what
happens when this breathing is disrupted by violent bloody means?
Nothing less than ontological slaughtering unless one already presumes
that breathing or what makes a human being a subject is only reserved
for the coloniser, the settler who cannot hear the breathing of the
slave and the colonised]{.underline}**. Fanon recognises that **[the
'stability' of the coloniser's being is directly connected to the
native's hallucinatory whitening that is, annihilation and also his/her
ontological suffocation. Ultimately, for this antagonism to be
disrupted,]{.underline}** that is the suffocation, that theft of air
that is assumed to be required for stability, **[violence is
required:]{.underline}**

**[Decolonization which sets out to change the order of the world, is,
obviously, a program of complete disorder \... Decolonization is the
meeting of two forces, opposed to each other by their very
nature]{.underline}** which in fact owe their originality to that sort
of substantification which results from and is nourished by the
situation in the colonies \... The native and the settler are old
acquaintances. In fact, the settler is right when he speaks of knowing
'them' well. (Fanon 1967d: 36)

Fanon first distinguishes the materiality of the life force from the
fact of property relations. For him, **[without politico-ontological
antagonisms about this life force there is no coherency in property
relations and juridical subject formations. However, these
politico-ontological antagonisms cannot be transformed and consolidated
into a supposedly ordered world]{.underline}**. Foucault presumes that
war and biopolitics remain technologies of societal coherence even when
he recognises that the idea of the universal subject is constituted by
force, but Fanon disrupts this dominant idea. For him, direct force is
not merely the theft of land and labor but that mere breath that keeps
alive the ongoing-relationship of ecologies and being. **[Consequently,
for Fanon,]{.underline}** **[while decolonisation emerges out of these
antagonisms, its constitutive energy is the combat breath itself -- the
disruptive force required for transformation]{.underline}**.

#### Combat Breath: the lived struggle of the slave and colonized subject, is vital in disrupting the spatial schism of ecology and body, in a violent state that exerts direct force and extermination for the sake of securing world order.

'Past Over Present', about the African struggles published in Al-Ahram,
an online Cairo newspaper, engages present tensions in the possibilities
for political transformation (Nkrumah 2000). Gamal Nkrumah, son of Kwame
Nkrumah, a founder of Pan-Africanism, opens with a photo of seven
chained slaves; the accompanying text states that in German South-West
Africa, the Herero uprising against European settler colonialism was
ruthlessly put down when the Germans killed 500,000 people. **[Nkrumah
argues that today's assembling of this European-world-order of violence
and instability depends on negotiation and peace but also on the
extermination of millions in the name of democracy. He comments on the
critical need to]{.underline}** do what Fanon talks about in The
Wretched of the Earth (1967d**[): disrupt and transform the central
relation of ontological violence that it takes to re-assemble and
reconstruct imperial powers]{.underline}**.1 Foreseeing the crises
generated by the postwar liberal international order, African, Arab, and
Asian leaders designed and worked to implement an alternative to this
order, or what Siba Grovogui (2007) calls 'multiple orders of
justification' which were interested in addressing 'diverse political
and moral concerns', seeking to put in place the contours of a global
'order of justification' that embodied justice, freedom, and democracy.
Their interventions disrupted the dominant methods of reassembling
imperial-sovereignties, opening up space for not only Africans but for
all colonised peoples to avoid naturalising and essentialising their
ongoing struggles; now they could 'reread them and reposition \... them
in terms of the new problem-space, the new context of questions, that
define\[d\] their present' (Scott 1999: 224).

These multiple struggles point to the problem-spaces of 'embodiment'
(Bosnak 2007; Ihde 2001; Seremetakis 1994; MerleauPonty 1962) and
Fanon's theory of 'combat breath' (Fanon 1967c: 65**[). Fanon
understands 'combat breathing' as the lived struggle of the slave and
colonised subject contending with foreign violence and surveillance and
the 'monopolizing notion of humanity that gives to the colonizer's
values all ontological weight']{.underline}** (Maldonado-Torres 2005:
154). **[He sees freedom as a structuring ontology, not just a political
experience and practice;]{.underline}** this gestures back to the
Stoics, for whom air, breath and soul are one. Anaximenes states that
'our soul (yuch), being air (aera&), holds us together, so do breath
(pneuBma) and air (aera&) encompass the whole world. Yuch is air; air
and pneuma are synonyms; therefore the soul is also pneuma' (Anaximenes
1898, quoted in Benso 2008: 14; Vamvacas 2009). I read Fanon's idea of
combat breath to point beyond violence to the relation of the
materiality and immateriality of the breath (pneuBma) to open up a
'different idea of the polis from that envisioned by the metaphysical
(and Roman) West' (Spanos 2000: 206). I work with Fanon to understand
the new problem-space that shapes our present. Combat breath, I argue,
is not an event of the past, or what remains after slavery and
colonialism, nor the 'end' of anti-colonial projects (such as
development, national liberation, socialisms and communisms) but living
practices constituted in involuntary constrictions of specific peoples'
lives. **[With Fanon, I articulate combat breath as lived existential
struggles that bring together the 'infinite and the finite without
collapsing them into a
monolithicprocess']{.underline}**(ZˇizˇekandMilibank2009:17). **[This
combat breath of the living disrupts and exceeds the dominant implicit
spatial schism of ecology and body, sovereign subject and its soma or
flesh, person and living being]{.underline}** (the phenomenon and the
noumenon) **[in political projects and their desired contingent
orders.]{.underline}**

**[Since the 1990s, political projects changing the world order and
institutions alike have involved intensified war and
slaughter]{.underline}** (Goodman 2010), **[pauperisation, and
restructuring institutions such as the state and the market, ecologies,
and corporealities in the name of progress]{.underline}**. Such
restructuring has become the focus of contestation in many parts of the
world, though often in more complex ways than most analyses acknowledge:
what kinds of expenditures, for instance, are required to erect such
order(s) and sovereign bodies, and make viable such projects?

Worldwide, a diverse (neo) liberal leadership has intensified its
involvement in (post) and (neo) reconstructions by focusing on grammars
and ethics of suffering in the name of security and humanitarian
regimes**[. Direct force is extended and refined in the name of 'saving
the state and the market' and securing world peace and
order]{.underline}**; venturist states and markets stalk opportunity by
leveraging somata's 'surpluses' (taxes, extraction of more value from
labour, sale of body parts and 'body bits', regeneration of bodies),
**[buffering the state's capacity to incur substantial debts and carry
out executions, whether this entails deployment of forces, structural
financial repairs, policing action, or suffocating
people.]{.underline}** Such interventions point to the deployment and
limits of temporal and spatial reassemblages and derivative
reconstructions across political, social, economic, and corporeal
registers. Thematically speaking, **[derivative reconstructions disclose
the power of a derivative-slave-colonisation death discourse with
definite practices and purposes: the use of vital energies of 'black'
states, slaves, and 'black' ecologies even at the moment of their
execution to generate capable somata (such as land,
bodies)]{.underline}**.2

[An ethic of incommensurability, which guides moves that **unsettle
innocence**, stands in contrast to aims of reconciliation, which
motivate settler moves to innocence. Reconciliation is about rescuing
settler normalcy, about rescuing a settler future]{.underline}.
Reconciliation is concerned with questions of [***what will
decolonization look like? What** will happen **after** abolition**?**
**What** will be* *the **consequences** of decolonization **for the
settler?*** Incommensurability acknowledges]{.underline} that these
[questions need not]{.underline}, and perhaps cannot, [be
answered]{.underline} in order for decolonization to exist as a
framework. We want to say, first, that [**decolonization** **is not
obliged to answer** those questions - **decolonization** is **not
accountable to settlers**, or settler futurity. Decolonization is
accountable to **Indigenous sovereignty** and futurity.]{.underline}
Still, we acknowledge the questions of those wary participants in Occupy
Oakland and other settlers who want to know what decolonization will
require of them. [The answers are not fully in view and can't be as long
as decolonization remains punctuated by metaphor. The **answers** will
not emerge from friendly understanding, and indeed **require** a
**dangerous understanding** of uncommonality that un-coalesces coalition
politics - moves that may feel very unfriendly. But we will find out the
answers as we get there, "in the exact measure that we can discern the
movements which give \[decolonization\] historical form and
content"]{.underline} (Fanon, 1963, p. 36). To fully enact an ethic of
incommensurability means relinquishing settler futurity, [**abandoning**
the **hope** that **settlers may** one day **be commensurable to
Native** peoples. It means removing the asterisks, periods, commas,
apostrophes, the whereas's, buts, and conditional clauses that punctuate
decolonization and underwrite settler innocence. The Native futures, the
lives to be lived once the settler nation is gone - these are the
**unwritten possibilities** made possible by an ethic of
incommensurability.]{.underline}

What IR wagers say about passion and unthinkable feelings and global
politics In the introduction to this volume, the editors defined
**[wagers as "the choice]{.underline}** is **[made prior to the conduct
of empirical research]{.underline}** which subsequently structure
research design." This definition **[is important, especially for
conventional IR,]{.underline}** which has given little thought to the
politics of the choices made before conducting empirical research period
rather, much of such literature assumes that empirics are not informed
by assumptions and wages made about the world. To pose the question
about the choices made prior to conducting empirical research demands A
literacy that cannot be reduced to script lively to what we already
know. It forces us to think, yet is by definition beyond the capture of
what things say. Normally, this demands to think binds thought to
practical principles and reasons, but it paradoxically loses its hold,
and we are confronted with what different modes of thinking trust in,
that is, with the assumptions they make and the risks they take. The
merriam Webster dictionary defines wager as: a colon something (such as
a sum of money) risked on an uncertain event: steak B: something on
which bets are laid: gamble do a stunt as a wager and its archaic
definition: and act of giving a pledge to take and abide by the result
some action. Interestingly, [this definition speaks to the stakes of
taking risks and gambling]{.underline} (as if they are segregated
activities) and to the act of gambling itself, both of which point to
speculative aspects, strategies as cognitive and as financial acts that
engineer future commodified by derivatives, quantified by risk
management models, and preempted in fiscal policy and military strategy,
a feature both risky and foreseeable. The making of this possibility
does not depend on utopian promises but rather on making value through a
"preponderance for risk taking with high levels of testosterone and
therefore masculinity" (Nelson 2013, cited in McClean 2016: 428). Making
these choices explicit is pivotal for undertaking any research project.
However**[, this waging approach does not challenge the onto
epistemological assumptions that inform them.]{.underline}** 211 **[this
intervention speaks more to the criteria guiding the research design. It
does not raise questions about and whether research and knowledge
production and IR as a discipline, field, and ethos are themselves
problematic in the sense that they contribute to the making of a
sex-affective-empire Co constituted with a certain liberal
order.]{.underline}** Within this assemblage those the sovereign does
attend or even pay attention to when they hear are rendered illegible as
a given social logic, or logos. **[This makes it hard to understand
imperial subjecthood for those enslaved and colonial subjects as a
meaningful subjectivity]{.underline}**. Their loss would occasion a
disorientation, a feeling of being outside of the logos. If, as i
articulated above, [affects are sorted through the axes of power of sex
and raciality that accrue their meaning enforced through assembled
colonial, enslaving, and settler colonial relations, what sorts of
methodological insights into their wagers might the researchers of the
affective turn provide to us, so that we may think their work beyond the
pragmatic choices made prior to empirical research about sex and race as
all-encompassing, dynamic, and self organizing forces?]{.underline} I
argue that **[focusing mostly on the wages,]{.underline}** [that is, the
choices and propositions researchers make with regards to research
design, **may be useful**]{.underline}. Such an approach, the wagering
on the possibility, however implausible or unlikely from the point of
view of our contemporary knowledge, and attending to the our methods and
their launching into the developing process of the world, might find a
response so that such methods themselves might become practically
configurative of the responses to the problems that the present poses.
**[This quite innovative approach could challenge not only the dominant
propositions that inscribe IR, but also the materiality of our
contemporary imperial affective assemblages]{.underline}**. **[However,
if this wagering is confined to the methodological choices, then this
strategy can only be extended to an epistemic critique. If the aim is to
challenge the assemblage of sexual affective empire thus simultaneously
contesting colonialism, settler colonialism and enslavement and the
myriad effects of inattention, neglect, and abandonment, that challenge
will not be achieved by epistemic critique, but rather by contesting the
empire in a more general description of its language of
time]{.underline}** period **[the interminable process of epistemic
critique and interpretation of phenomena and its issues of final truths
and objective facts cannot simply be adjudicated through our research
and the choices of our methods]{.underline}**. Perhaps what is at stake
here in this fine distinction and most radically the matter with IR is
not that there may be no way out of the epistemological presuppositions
through method, but more aporectically, that the binary sorting of those
whose feelings are valued and those who are not, those whose sex and
racialized identities are given attention and care and those who do not,
be become meaningless, and the ideological affects the ground impossible
as I R thought and practice. **[Pointing to this question of production
and valuation of affects as a violence requires investigating the
foundations of theories and their affective-epistemological strucutres
to understand the guidance of ontological and political practices they
propose or make possible. This demands A rethinking of dominant
epistemological frameworks within which questions of power and global
politics, violence and freedom, and knowledge are
approached.]{.underline}** 212 For this reason, wagers and assumptions
in the form of choices made before empirical research and wagers to
extend the life of our theorizations cannot be understood outside an
empire of sexual affects. **[The emergence and repurposing of sexual
affective empire solicits the production of particular ways of feeling,
being, desiring, and knowing (while simultaneously destroying others)
that make viable A reconstituted imperial world order. Central to
this]{.underline}**, as I said above, **[are affective economies,
characterized as the circulation and mobilization of feelings of desire,
fear, and pleasure that seduce all of us into becoming emotionally,
libido annually, and erotically invested in global capitalism and
imperialisms mirages of care, security, and inclusion]{.underline}**.
**[This emerging empire becomes Co constituted through "the process of
seduction \[for some\] so violence that proceeds through false promises
of an end to oppression and pain]{.underline}**" (Agathangelou,
Bassichis and Spira 2008: 122). [And more recently, to an intensified
form of speculation that does not promise any utopian
possibility.]{.underline} These affective economies are entangled with
global ruling epistemologies that enable the production of surplus value
and material relations (Agathangelou 2004: 6-12). This understanding of
structural power recognizes that current systems depend on certain forms
of violence that allow feelings and freedom for some and anxiety,
terror, and unfreedom for others. The latter need to be changed,
integrated, or killed to make possible and repurpose the
sex-affective-empire. [Researchers thus have to speak more to the onto
epistemologies that sort and organize different affects, including the
ways these onto epistemologies do not grapple with how neglect,
abandonment, or indifference are entangled with certain forms of
dominant capital and white supremacy power. **Wagers, thus, are not so
much about providing us with methodological criteria to trace a history
of passion politics, as they are a theoretical analysis of the
possibility of structure of time (IE, the future) and such politics and
the attempts to organize, order, segregate, and violently expunge some
lives and their affects and not others. They are not neutral
technologies of knowledge making and governance either.**]{.underline}
In the introduction to this volume, the editors speak of wagers and IR
and passion politics citing Jackson and Nexon, "wagers," they tell us,
"precede empirical studies and, in turn, 'cash out' in the form of
different accounts of political phenomena...\[There are\] Wagers about
epistemology\--how things and processes are knowable." While I agree, I
suggest passion politics has mobile attachments, including contingent
wager regimes that extend the life of certain frames, including certain
systems of thought and affect and not others. **[What is at stake in
feeling for a future that may be more than just an extension of the
modern sexual affective empire]{.underline}**?

The review of the literature started with the goal of understanding if
there was support and advice for non-Indigenous researchers as
methodological guidance in advance of the research. [Some Indigenous
scholars recognize that particular non-Indigenous researchers have a
"genuine desire to support the cause"]{.underline} (Smith 2012a, p. 186)
and Kovach (2009, p. 11) [believes that there is a new generation
"seeking ways to understand the world without harming it".]{.underline}
Smith (2012a) and Louis (2007) discuss that [excluding non-Indigenous
researchers would only perpetuate Indigenous research as some sort of
cultural privilege, when it\'s an opportunity for non-Indigenous
researchers to develop "the tools they need to ensure that their
research agendas are]{.underline} 'sympathetic, respectful, and [ethical
from an Indigenous perspective']{.underline}" (Louis 2007, p. 134). [To
begin "decolonizing one's mind and heart" (Kovach 2009, p. 169),
non-Indigenous researchers need to begin the "self-education process"
well in advance of the research]{.underline} (Gaudry 2015, p. 259). The
five sections that follow provide a summary from the literature that I
utilized as initial guidance and advice to develop a process and a
methodology in decolonizing myself. In this paper, [the term Indigenous
will refer to Indigenous research collectively]{.underline}. The term
Inuit will be used when specifically discussing research in Inuit
Nunangat, "the distinct geographic, political, and cultural region that
includes the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (Northwest Territories),
Nunavut, Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and Nunatsiavut (Northern Labrador)"
(ITK 2018b, p. 18). The term non-Indigenous will refer to research
partners coming from outside of Indigenous cultures.

**[As a non-Indigenous researcher I]{.underline}** needed to [**educate
myself further about the colonial history of Indigenous peoples and the
resulting and continuing trauma.**]{.underline} For the North American
Inuit, the influence of colonialism started in the 17th century, when
whalers, explorers, missionaries and Hudson's Bay Company fur traders
first came to the Canadian Arctic (ITK 2006). However, it was during the
Cold War era of the 1950s when Inuit were forced to settle in
communities as part of the Government of Canada's assimilation approach
called the "in-gathering policy" (MacDonald 2018), and some communities
were relocated into the High Arctic to further Canadian Arctic
sovereignty (CBC 2010; Qikiqtani Inuit Association 2014). As part of the
Canadian government settlement and assimilation process, Inuit children
were required to attend school and sent away to residential schools. For
an Inuit-specific understanding on the impact of colonialism in Canada,
the "Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada
Commission report Volume 2: Canada's Residential Schools: The Inuit and
Northern Experience" (TRC 2015), and Chapter 4: Colonization as Gendered
Oppression and specifically the sub-section entitled "Colonial
Encounter: Distinctive Inuit Experiences" (MMIWG 2019) are excellent
resources. T[he term post-colonial is often used to describe the current
state of affairs, but many Indigenous scholars argue that this infers
that "colonialism no longer exists"]{.underline} (Smith 2012a, p. 25).
[Colonialism in the Canadian context is described as
set]{.underline}tler [col]{.underline}onialism, in [which people from
other countries invaded, settled and established sovereign
power]{.underline} (Barker and Battell Lowman 2016).
[Se]{.underline}ttler [col]{.underline}onialism [is an ongoing process
that continues to structure and shape relations between Indigenous
peoples and settlers]{.underline} (Wolfe 2006; Tuck and Yang 2012;
Veracini 2013). Castleden et al. (2012) and Simpson (2004) both argue
that ex[ternal colonial control through ongoing federal government
policies and practices continues to marginalize Indigenous peoples in
Canada.]{.underline} Price (2007) and McGrath (2018) argue that
[colonialism continues to systematically and symbolically undermine and
devalue the Inuit cultural systems that once made them
self-sufficient.]{.underline}

Colonial technologies of power are designed to rule over the body, mind,
spirit, temporality, and environment of those it claims as its subjects.
[Colonial power is implicitly and explicitly articulated through
constant coercive force. Its pillars of political and economic power
malignantly **rest on genocide, slavery, alienation, and
ecocide**]{.underline}. The dominant social order's Machiavellian
enforcement and justifications contrast sharply against liberatory calls
for power with, not over. [Without coercion through external and
internalized violence]{.underline} (the cops and the cops inside your
head), [those who rule and the rules they seek to impose are all but
meaningless]{.underline}. The unambiguous assertion of power with is an
expression that aligns with cultural knowledge systems that have existed
before (and in spite of) colonial rule on these lands. In sometimes
awkwardly contorted ways (due to leftists staking claims of how power is
concentrated and distributed), [it has also oriented much of what is
considered **as social justice movement organizing in the so-called
US.**]{.underline} Most "progressive" [activist campaigns are
centered]{.underline} in uncomplicated attempts at moral persuasion of
those [above in the dominant social, economic, and political hierarchy.
They're concerned with "target" audiences,]{.underline} demographics,
and most often voters and building support (or a base) within those
communities so they can influence decision makers (usually politicians).
They study their target audience, choose tactics they believe will
persuade them to pressure their primary target (the decision maker),
[and work to get attention]{.underline} (while documenting the effort
for their funders). [Their influence tends towards capacity building,
which]{.underline} is how they perceive organizational power is built.
It requires more funding for staff, which requires a steady stream of
grants, which requires accountability to the foundations and
philanthropists that they [become dependent on to maintain and cultivate
their ever-expanding capacity. Eventually those foundations]{.underline}
look down upon radical actions and emphasize tactics that [focus on
services and non-confrontational forms of political
persuasion]{.underline}. They economically emphasize tactics of refusal
(like strikes, boycotts, divestments, etc.) and passivity (not doing
something you are supposed to be doing). They accept mild threats so
long as they don't conflict with their own positions and proximity to
economic and political power. **[The insular and myopic world of
non-profit activism is maintained as such by design]{.underline}**. This
dynamic is incisively confronted in the book The Revolution Will Not Be
Funded by INCITE! (2007). They also join a leftist chorus calling for
counter-power (or the term Lenin coined "dual power" in some spaces),
which is proclaimed as "building a new world in the shell of the old."
[Strategies range from community gardening to independent media, housing
and business co-ops, schools, clinics, etc. And **while alternative
infrastructures are necessary to end corporate and State dependencies,
counter or dual power on stolen land is neo-colonial.**]{.underline} For
all the Indigenous-centering and lipservice to Land Back, leftists have
a lot of modern hangups. Ziq also assails how the idea of dual power as
revisionism of "authoritarian ideology" in their brief polemic, Shut up
about 'dual power', tool, they caution against the "corrupting force of
all power." [Most anti-imperialists and anti-capitalists are locked into
the logic of fighting empire on empire's terms]{.underline}; building a
revolutionary force on the scale of the empire to fight the empire.
[While intervening is critical, autonomous anti-colonialists also focus
their attacks on where the empire draws its power from]{.underline}.
This offers a much more varied asymmetric and amorphous possibility of
intervention that requires a whole lot less complicated revolutionary
theorizing. [You don't need enlightened professional]{.underline}
organizers or a vanguard to lead the way. [Sometimes you just need a bad
idea, the wherewithal to try it, and the meticulous attention to detail
to ensure you get away with it.]{.underline} **[Indigenous power is
often reduced to visibility]{.underline}** (or recognition) as
exemplified [with the slogan that so many Indigenous activists and
artists embrace, "We are still here]{.underline}." But this is an
incomplete statement of survival, shouldn't **[we also be concerned with
where we are and how intact or whole the we part actually
is]{.underline}**? When first proclaimed in the 1960s, [Red Power was a
compliment to the ethnic and gender power movements]{.underline} of the
day, particularly Black Power which either proposed distinct
nationalisms based on revolutionary communist ideas, or equality and
inclusion into settler society through civil reforms. [The expressedly
revolutionary aspects of the "civil rights" era fixated on the strategy
of building **the power of the people to overturn one system of power to
replace it with another**]{.underline}. The [Red Power]{.underline}
manifestos and statements of the [era focused on protest and
mobilization towards the **idea of Indigenous self-determination**,
which comprised treaty rights, economic development, education, and
cultural preservation. Red Power was issued as a demand of colonial
power and as such was progressively negotiated or assimilated into the
US colonial polity. Certain rights were granted by colonizers as
concessions to contain the extreme militancy of **Indigenous, queer,
feminist, Black, Xikan@,** ecologica]{.underline}l, and other uprisings.
As part of the history of the "US" civil rights movement, [these
struggles had primarily **been forced to operate under the terms of and
within the confines of colonial oppression** to negotiate what "rights"
and "legal privileges" could be distributed to subjugated
"Indians."]{.underline} While radical Indigenous analysts within
proximity to the American Indian Movement and its concomitant forces
understood that **[sovereignty by definition cannot be practiced under
the authority of another political entity]{.underline}**, and their
tactics were hostile and militant, most of the Red Power movement's
immediate goals were based in reforms. As I previously state, there are
many lessons to learn and unlearn with how the State reflexively
counter-attacked the militancy of the 1960s and '70s. Systems of social
management and control were also built through the development of social
justice organizing. [These state-sanctioned models still inform and
heavily influence how activism is done today.]{.underline} Concessions
turned into political conformity and merchandising, [select
revolutionary actors of the era built political careers]{.underline},
some went in and out of retirement circulating on unending speaking
tours, many got PhDs and wrote books which established their authority
of The Struggle™, and many others went from hippy to yuppy to boomer in
a couple of generational steps. From bad parodies of outdated
revolutionary clichés, non-profit profiteering, and the adoption of
"nonviolent direct action" as the status quo in organizing, the Power of
the People was largely subsumed or rendered inert by the State and its
collaborating capitalist forces. [Red Power]{.underline}, like Land
Back, means different things depending on who you talk to or what book
you read, but **[ultimately inspired and reactivated powerful
multi-generational resistance.]{.underline}** My elders assert that
power is a spiritual source and responsibility that is shared with all
of creation. **[Our medicine is power. Our power is

Dangers of Hope

**[At the core of the relations between indigenous peoples and states
today is the expectation that the peoples are to trust that the
envisioned improvements will materialise]{.underline}**. [However,
critical indigenous and postcolonial scholarship has contributed
extensive analyses revealing the range of problems entailed in trusting
state-led processes that promise change and improvements (e.g.
Betasamosake Simpson 2017; Niezen 2017; Povinelli 2011; Regan
2011).]{.underline} That scholarship emphasises, as we do in this book,
that colonialism has not ceased and that it continues to have a bearing
on indigenous--state relations. **[The historical slate cannot be wiped
clean, and state policies of today cannot be rid of the baggage of past
betrayals where the hopes of indigenous peoples were
concerned]{.underline}**. Because the peoples have concretely
experienced a chain of broken promises, the willingness of states to
offer hope for reconciliation can engender contradictory reactions. In a
case in point, [Rauna Kuokkanen (2020) summarises the mixed perceptions
of the Sámi regarding the recent intentions of the Finnish state to
initiate a truth and reconciliations process]{.underline}. She ponders
the unclear motives of the state, asking "why the Government of Finland
has agreed to embark on a truth and reconciliation process, given its
sketchy track record of acting upon the Sámi Parliament's requests"
(Kuokkanen 2020, 297). Tellingly, the hopes that states proffer to
indigenous peoples are often met with scepticism. Indigenous peoples
have observed how "partnership" with states is elusive: in some matters
the relationship holds, while in others states fail to honour the norm
of reciprocity that partnership implies. [The processes of recognition
in Australia, Finland and Greenland, each exemplify a dynamic in which
the genuineness of partnership may well be called into
question.]{.underline}

Despite reservations and criticism on the part of indigenous peoples,
they are in many ways compelled to negotiate with states, as the
peoples' rights and material circumstances depend on them. [The
improvements promised by states are particularly attractive to
indigenous peoples who struggle to regain what in fact are
unrelinquished rights.]{.underline} [As Betasamosake Simpson (2017)
points out,]{.underline} **[even the faintest signals of change in state
practices can encourage indigenous peoples' hopes for better-structured
and more just relations.]{.underline}** Because such change is so
intensely sought after and hoped for, even minimal gestures can be
enough to maintain a belief in it. Borrowing Betasamosake Simpson's
wording (2017, 45), being hopeful and seeing signals of change are
"attractive" for indigenous peoples. Crucially, as the developments in
our selected countries also highlight, states are well aware of this
inclination to remain hopeful and exploit this tendency for their own,
less sincere ends. This is precisely what we have termed the politics of
hope.

In previous research, hope has been understood as crucial for indigenous
peoples in initiating positive change (e.g. Dinerstein 2015; Haro 2010;
Lear 2008). However, the very same promise of transformation and
empowerment that drives the efforts of those that would go against the
dominant regime can become unfavourable to their cause. Faced with
increased calls for rights, recognition and justice by the world's
indigenous peoples, politics has drawn on the soothing, encouraging and
faith-engendering nature of hope, and continues to do so. **[Where hope
may enable indigenous peoples to resist, mobilise and drive radical
change, the states may equally operationalise hope in order to govern
the peoples]{.underline}**. This equivocality characterises politics of
hope and, as we have illustrated, politics has seized on this
ambivalence to create (novel) mechanisms of governing. Instead of
prioritising an affirmative reading of hope, one should recognise its
dual political valence positive in enabling and negative in restricting.
In respect to indigenous-- state relations, the pressing question is,
what kind of politics are states exercising in and through hope?

**[The general ethos of hopefulness enables states to act
evasively.]{.underline}** **[We see procrastination as a repeating
pattern in present-day relations between indigenous peoples and states.
Instilling hopes for rights and recognition, as the cases discussed
show, provides states with wiggle room, even in the midst of heated
debates.]{.underline}** If there is hope, there is something to look
forward to, to anticipate (something better). However, the future
trajectory of hope in any given case has profound political
significance, for it enables politics to postpone changes today. **[Hope
strips the urgency from the matters at hand as its rewards are always
yet to come.]{.underline}** **[Indeed, when transformation requires
constant anticipation, the result can very well be a state of stagnation
where the envisioned change remains elusive, never materialising,
perhaps indefinitely. This dynamic hides beneath it the ways in which
changes regarding indigenous peoples' rights are postponed and
evaded.]{.underline}**

Indigenous peoples and their struggles for rights are a case in point of
politics being able to draw on the potentially inexhaustible resource of
hope. [States insinuate hope in what they say -- "maybe" in one form or
another -- and in this way succeed in capturing the attention of those
parts of the population who are in need of hope. For states, it has been
smart to say "maybe" in certain processes of rights and recognition as
this has enabled them to avoid the worst of national and international
shame at their failures to date. **By continuously offering "maybe",
states can rely on the peoples' persistent hope, all the while foisting
the responsibility for any envisioned development upon the
peoples**]{.underline}. By no means is the exercise of such a politics
unique to indigenous issues; many other minorities globally are still in
the process of waiting for equal rights. This is the condition that Hage
(2009) calls "stuckedness".

[Indigenous peoples are well aware that states have played for time and
continue to do so when it comes to issues that challenge them.
Australia, Finland and Greenland provide examples of indigenous peoples
challenging the states' procrastination.]{.underline} The call by
Australian indigenous peoples in 2017 to establish a new political body
-- known as "Voice" -- represents a particularly cogent example (The
Uluru Statement from the Heart 2017). This collective expression of will
can be considered historic. After decades of fruitless reports and
assessments, the peoples reached out for a solution on their own terms.
The call for Voice represents a refusal to settle for the state-offered
process of recognition. Not surprisingly, the response by the Australian
state has been to commission further assessments on the recognition
process as a whole because the indigenous peoples' initiative has not
been considered politically viable (Response to Referendum Council's
Report on Constitutional Recognition 2017). It is noteworthy that the
state has refused to revise the "terms of reference" of the process to
accommodate the claims of the indigenous peoples; it has kept the
process alive, but on its own terms.

The tension in indigenous--state relations in Greenland was also
palpable in the reactions to a statement by Prime Minister Aleqa
Hammond's in 2013. In her speech at the Arctic Circle Assembly, Hammond
concluded that Greenland would become independent "within my lifetime"
(Thisted 2020, 4). The confidence and concreteness of this statement
took Denmark by surprise. Although the Act on Greenland Self-Government
explicitly states that Greenland may become independent, the directly
expressed intention to do so resulted in a heated and emotional
discussion in Denmark. Reflecting on these events, Kirsten Thisted
(2020) describes the affective dynamics involved in the relations
between indigenous peoples and their colonisers. She highlights how,
paradoxically, where an alleged partnership prevails, wanting to break
away from this -- through independence -- is seen as betrayal. Greenland
was even seen as wanting to leave a "marriage" (Thisted 2020, 8). One
could infer from this that, even though it has granted Greenland the
right to become independent, Denmark has not considered this a realistic
possibility. As there are major prerequisites for Greenland's
independence, the assumption has been that, if not outright impossible,
it will be an extremely difficult and protracted process. In this light,
it is no wonder that Hammond's reference to her "lifetime" caused upset
in Denmark, because it suddenly gave Greenlandic independence a
timeframe.

**[Indeed, indigenous peoples do engage in politics that they themselves
define and through that put pressure on states.]{.underline}** In the
political equation of indigenous-- state relations, states, however,
continue to hold the authority to determine which demands can be pursued
and the time horizon within which they might be met. Previous critical
scholarship on the development of the relations between indigenous
peoples and states has also pointed out how states' calls for waiting
and the promise of progress circumscribe the position of indigenous
peoples (e.g. Povinelli 2011; Sutton 2009). [Clearly, states have
adopted procrastination as their mode of engagement with indigenous
peoples. The prevailing ethos of promise produces a condition where
indigenous peoples must tolerate the relationships they have with the
colonisers until the peoples' demands have been resolved.]{.underline}
The ultimate challenge here is that the realisation of envisioned
improvements repeatedly slips from the present into the future. **[The
time frame for the restructured relationship is always "not-yet" and, in
the meanwhile, the status quo is maintained.]{.underline}**

4.5 Existential risk as a crisis discipline

I have discussed a notion of creativity suitable for examination via the
economic approach. [One way of contextualising such discussions is via a
description of an]{.underline} **[epistemic situation]{.underline}**.
[An investigation's epistemic situation is the sum of the challenges
facing knowledge-generation, and the resources available for overcoming
those challenges]{.underline}. I've thus far discussed the challenges
facing paradigm X-risk investigations. Paradigm X-risks are unique,
involve wild systems, and involve secondorder ignorance. Further, they
are in the public eye, having the potential to generate over-reactions,
a loss of faith, and mismanagement. These challenges are not
insurmountable: many of them are not unique to X-risk, and so we can
take our cue from other research areas.

**[It is useful to consider X-risk as a crisis
discipline]{.underline}**. In 1985, Michael Soulé developed the latter
notion by comparing conservation biology and cancer research. Both
disciplines are geared towards a particular outcome (curing cancer,
preserving biodiversity) so membership in the crisis discipline turns on
possession of a set of scientific expertise related to achieving that
outcome. In addition to ecologists, then, conservation biology includes
veterinary specialists, experts in land management, and so on. We've
already had a hint about the wide variety of disciplines involved in
X-risk --- indeed, given our second-order ignorance, it's actually
unclear which disciplines will matter. In addition to being
multi-disciplinary, crisis disciplines are normative: X-risk is not
simply in the business of describing or explaining low-probability, high
impact events, but also in ascertaining how to minimise the occurrence
and impact of such events. A final similarity concerns the need to be
tolerant of uncertainty:

A conservation biologist may have to make decisions or recommendations
about design and management before he or she is completely comfortable
with the theoretical and empirical bases of the analysis.54

In addition to having the characteristics of a crisis discipline,
uniqueness and second-order ignorance mean that X-risk studies will
often occur in evidentially impoverished circumstances. I've analysed
similar epistemic situations occurring in "historical sciences" such as
paleontology, geology, and archaeology55 and here, the success of the
sciences is best explained by appeal to the speculative, creative nature
of their approach (Alison Wylie has made similar arguments concerning
archaeology; see Wylie (1999), Chapman and Wylie (2016)).56

I've sketched a set of investigative strategies which maximise
evidential reach in historical science. **[Story-telling and
scenario-building serve to maximise the empirical links between
hypotheses]{.underline}**. Historical reconstruction doesn't simply rely
on the relationship between contemporary remains --- traces --- and the
past, but on the connections between our hypotheses about the past.
Further, such speculation often generates testable hypotheses (Currie,
2017; Currie and Sterelny, 2017): historical scientists are highly
creative in my sense. I've characterised **[historical
scientists]{.underline}** as "methodological omnivores".57
Methodological omnivores engage in two distinctive behaviours. First,
they **[construct epistemic tools and models calibrated to local
context]{.underline}** (as opposed to using general-purpose tools),
**[enabling rich data to be generated]{.underline}**. [Second, a
pluralistic, opportunistic attitude to techniques, methods and research
approaches allows a wide range of perspectives, and different types of
evidence, to be available.]{.underline} Finally, uniqueness can be
mitigated by the use of partial analogies.58

Paradigm X-risks are not precisely in the same epistemic situation as
conservation biology or paleontology --- the tragedy of the uncommons is
one difference --- but nonetheless the similarities can give us an
inkling of the epistemic strategies which a science of X-risk should
adopt. The science should be multi-disciplinary, pluralistic, and
opportunistic. Such a science meets the criteria for creativity in the
sense I discussed in Section 2. Each of these factors involve a
community that does not pool, but rather explores solution space widely.

A science of X-risk, then, should be creative

5\. Discussion

A successful science of X-risk will be creative. But, as we've seen,
contemporary scientific incentives don't often encourage creativity.
Rather, they encourage cold searches. Hence, the properties required for
studying X-risk are not promoted in scientific communities. With this in
place, I want to (1) characterise this problem abstractly: that science
is "badly adapted" for studying X-risk and (2) continue my initial
sketch of a well-adapted science of X-risk.

5.1 Well-adapted science

I've given reason to think that the incentive structures governing
science are in a sense "maladapted" for some epistemic situations,
existential risk in particular. Where that situation calls for
creativity, conservatism is improperly encouraged. In this section, I'll
characterise the problem abstractly and discuss its relationship with
the economic approach on the one hand, and with work on the relationship
between social values and science on the other.

The notion of "well adapted" I want to develop concerns whether
scientific incentives encourage the kind of work that is appropriate
given an epistemic situation:

A scientific community is well adapted to the extent that the incentives
of that community promote the attainment of desired research outcomes,
given the epistemic situation at hand.

Let's contrast being well adapted in my sense --- which is a
relationship between a set of incentives and an epistemic situation ---
and the notion of an individual scientist or community being adapted to
a set of incentives. Work in the economic approach is often not
sensitive to this difference, and often the focus is more on the latter.
Weisberg and Muldoon's landscape models and their descendants explore
how different proportions of exploration strategies might be
differentially optimal in various landscapes; Zollman's bandit models
explore how scientists might learn to adapt to an epistemic situation.
Here, an adapted scientist (or community) is one which maximises their
returns (in terms of credit or knowledge) given some set of incentives.
To be well adapted in my sense, by contrast, requires those incentive
structures to be themselves set in order to maximise the epistemic (or
other) outputs that we desire given an epistemic situation. For
instance, given the nature of X-risk, incentives in the community should
encourage creativity. So, one sense of "adaptive" concerns how well
scientific behaviours maximise payoffs given a set of incentive
structures. Another --- mine --- concerns how incentive structures might
be organised to maximise epistemic outputs. Again, such a distinction is
likely implicit in much of the economic approach, but it is useful to
make it explicit.

[Socially-inclined philosophers of science have argued that decisions
about the pursuit worthiness of a scientific investigation or enterprise
--- what makes that research program a good one to do --- turns on more
than epistemic significance]{.underline}. **[Rather, a cost-benefit
calculus is required to balance preferences for research outcomes, the
efficiency of investigative approaches to those outcomes, as well as
budgetary and ethical constraints.]{.underline}** Philip Kitcher's
approach is perhaps the clearest example.59 For him, a science is "well
ordered" to the extent that which research we pursue is decided by
deliberation which approaches the cost-benefit calculus mentioned
above.60 So, discussion of the role of values in science often draws our
attention to how the organisation of science itself affects the
efficiency of a research program: concerns about scientific organisation
and prioritisation are taken as questions of resource distribution.
Given a range of possible questions scientists might be asking, by what
principles should they direct their efforts? In short, a well-ordered
science is one which balances (1) some suitably trained ("tutored")
preferences, against (2) the efficiency of particular research programs
in meeting those preferences, and (3) the costs (considered in terms of
finances, resources, and ethics) of those programs.61

*analysis based on worldly anticolonialism would ask how such categories
of thought take material form*]{.underline}, [in relation to specific
terrains of anticolonial political struggle that have been shaped by
variable colonial relations of power]{.underline}. One analogous
approach can be found in recent work by Mamdani(2020),who analyzes how
continued investments in the category of the"nation"in settler and
postcolonial societies alike have themselves been generated through the
politically-mediated fashioning of specific collective constituencies.
[The political identities and imaginaries of these constituencies are
deeply bound to the colonial past not only as pure epistemology but
through constitutive political and historical processes]{.underline}.7
To illustrate some more specific benefits of worldly anticolonialism as
a point of departure, I turn to the complex relationship between
organized labor struggles and Indigenous peoples' struggles.

[Consider]{.underline} that [leadership of major trade unions throughout
North America largely continues to believe that extracting more fossil
fuels on Indigenous lands will furnish some of the few remaining good
jobs in an environment of radical austerity and upward
redistribution]{.underline} (Sanicola & Williams, 2021). [This framing
of]{.underline} worker [interests makes it far easier for fossil fuel
corporations to create a profoundly antagonized field of political
contest pitting]{.underline} "workers' interests" [(jobs)]{.underline}
[against those of "Indigenous peoples" and environmental
movements]{.underline} (keeping oil in the ground)(Walia,2015).8

The [goals of more *radical* union membership and **anticolonial
movements** *must* be to present compelling ***political--economic***
alternatives based on massive decarbonization. This means
**reorienting** non-Indigenous working people toward the ways that their
*freedom and well-being* also depend---albeit differently than
Indigenous peoples themselves---upon *securing and enhancing*
**Indigenous sovereignty**]{.underline}(Klein, 2014,pp.398−407). To be
sure, such [union leaders]{.underline} and some rank-and-file union
members certainly do [*participate* in the pervasive colonial epistemic
erasure of Indigenous peoples and the perpetuation of intensely gendered
forms of colonial violence when they seek to construct new pipeline
infrastructures to secure their livelihoods]{.underline}. I want to
suggest, however, that is [not obvious at all that critical political
theorists should primarily]{.underline} (let alone, only) [foreground
this colonial epistemic arrogance per se as the primary obstacle to an
alternative anticolonial coalition praxis]{.underline}. Indeed, [a *key
goal* of worldly anticol]{.underline}onialism [would be to *reconfigure
this framing of the political situation at hand*, by imagining more
robust and compelling affinities, if not convergences, between projects
of decolonization and decarbonization that would enhance the well-being
of people and the planet]{.underline}.9

This is so because [politics requires persuasion and organizing that can
reorient the interests and horizon making capacities of political
subjects]{.underline}. The [*obstacles* to this *are not simply
epistemic* in the sense of diagnosing and deconstructing colonial world
views]{.underline}. Instead, [they are rooted in real interests, fears,
hopes, and soon that make decolonization unsettling and
fraught---anxiety-provoking---for those with power and for those without
it but who see no other path beyond current arrangements of
power]{.underline} (Bosworth & Chua, 2021). [Such investments are both
more stubborn and more mediated by *genuine political conflict* than the
*epistemological* mechanisms that Mignolo proposes to
dislodge.]{.underline}

To be sure, I would agree with Mignolo were he to suggest in response
that colonial epistemic logics are clearly at work in the political
situation I have described here. No one has to look far to find the
[*frequent racist representations* of denigrated Indigenous "tradition"
as an obstacle to "progress" taking the form of ever-more
environmentally ruinous fossil fuel extraction]{.underline} (Mignolo,
2010a, p. 326). [Nevertheless, there is no necessary relationship
between the diagnosis of such colonial logics and the aspirations that
drive many modalities of critique]{.underline} (including anticolonial
critique) [to grasp the *possibilities* of *transformation* inherent in
struggles over possible futures]{.underline}. Put bluntly, [forcing open
those alternative possibilities will not come from epistemic
disobedience.]{.underline} [It will]{.underline} more likely [unfold
through impure,"unlikely alliances" that bind together interested
constituencies who come to imagine an "otherwise" to carbon-intensive
colonial capitalism from different entry points. This might
happen]{.underline} by reconfiguring their constitutive identities and
"interests" via mobilization and new forms of solidarity---that is,
*[through politics]{.underline}*.10

Altogether, I have sought to reflect on Mignolo's version of the
decolonial turn by subjecting some of his key interventions to critical
analysis in light of the historiography, intellectual history, and
present-day political stakes of anticolonial thought and practice. As
Rivera Cusicanqui (2020) and Nanibush (2018) both argue, [the
terminology of de/coloniality now takes up an immense amount of space in
debates about colonialism and empire in the humanities and interpretive
social sciences]{.underline}. My arguments suggest that [scholars
invested in anticolonial critique ought to turn to more worldly forms of
anticolonialism]{.underline}. [In this]{.underline} latter [orientation,
the role of epistemology in political struggles is studied both
theoretically and as a question of political organizing and
strategy]{.underline}. What is "decolonizing" here is the effort to
transform those epistemologies as they feed into and naturalize colonial
power relations.

This essay has aimed to probe whether de/coloniality delivers as an
improved mode of critique that patches up the perceived failures of
anticolonial thought to deal with the present-day dilemmas of ongoing
colonization. I have contended that such investments in decoloniality as
an improved analytic of colonial power are often premised on
insufficiently grappling with the complexities of those very histories
of anticolonialism and with the strengths of some existing material
analyses of colonial power, such as scholarship and activism in
Indigenous and settler-colonial studies. These latter investigations
usefully foreground and diagnose what Nanibush (2018, p. 29) aptly
characterizes as "the uneven political field of colonialism."

[Mignolo's de/coloniality is not just *another "option."*]{.underline}
Rather, [**it is a wrong turn altogether**. Efforts to render the past
of decolonization mainly through its pathologies and the present of
decolonization through an epistemic politics *undercuts serious
critical-theoretic reflection on the contested meanings of actual
struggles of and for decolonization today*]{.underline}. [**Insisting on
more worldly approaches to anticolonialism is a better---indeed,
politically urgent---starting point**.]{.underline}

6\. Democratising Risk

[**There is an intimate and neglected relationship between existential
risk and democracy.** Democracy must be central to efforts to prevent
and mitigate catastrophic risks.]{.underline} It is also an antidote to
many of the problems manifest in the TUA. Do those who study the future
of humanity have good grounds to ignore the visions, desires, and values
of the very people whose future they are trying to protect? Choosing
which risks to take must be a democratic endeavour.

We understand democracy here in accordance with Landemore as the rule of
the cognitively diverse many who are entitled to equal decision-making
power and partake in a democratic procedure that includes both a
deliberative element and one of preference aggregation (such as majority
voting).178 Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or
non-democratic, but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less
democratic, inclusive, and diverse.

We posit three reasons for why **[we should democratise research and
decision-making in existential risk:]{.underline}** [the nature of
collective decision making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, [or crafting a desirable
long-term future]{.underline}, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**.
Scholars of existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo
sapiens are choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain
views are excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

Democracy will improve our judgments in both the governance and the
study of existential risks. [Asking how our actions today influence the
long-term future is one of the most difficult intellectual tasks to
unravel, and if there is a right path, democratic procedures will have
the best shot at finding it.]{.underline} Hong and Page179 demonstrate
both theoretically and computationally that a diverse group of
problem-solving agents will show greater accuracy than a less diverse
group, even if the individual members of the diverse group were each
less accurate. **[Accuracy gains from diversity trump the gains from
improving individual accuracy.]{.underline}** Landemore180 builds on
this work to advance a probabilistic argument that inclusive democracies
will, in expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies
or even the wise few. This is supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the world.181
**[In the long run, democracies should commit fewer mistakes than
alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}**. **[If this is
true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decisionmaking]{.underline}**. [We are more likely to make accurate
predictions about the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and
risk prevention if the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat
institutional structures, and avoids conflicts of interest]{.underline}.

There are many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. **[An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects]{.underline}**. To get close to replicating the cognitive
diversity found among humans, we must begin by inviting different
thinkers with different values and beliefs into the field.

Democracies can limit harms. Any approach to mitigating existential
threats could create response risks, and the TUA seems particularly
vulnerable to this. Despite good intentions and curiosity-driven
research, it could justify violence, dangerous technological
developments, or drastically constrain freedom in favour of (perceived)
security. If we hope to explore ideas but minimise harms, democracies
can be used to moderate the measures taken in response to harmful ideas.
It seems, for example, vanishingly unlikely that a diverse group of
thinkers or even ordinary citizens would entertain the idea of
sacrificing one billion living, breathing beings for an infinitesimal
improvement in reaching an intergalactic techno-utopia. In contrast, the
TUA could recommend this trade-off.

The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective self-interest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be affected. We
expect that scholars who do not support sacrificing current lives in the
name of abstract calculations, but would still like to explore the use
of expected value theory in existential risk, will be in support of
democratic fail-safe mechanisms.

**[Empirically, this fail-safe mechanism seems to work. Even deeply
imperfect democracies, like the ones we inhabit now, often avert
detrimental outcomes]{.underline}**. **[Democracies prevent famines182
(although not malnutrition).183 They make war --- a significant driver
of GCRs --- less likely.]{.underline}**184 [The inclusion of diverse
preferences in democracies, such as those achieved through women's
suffrage, further decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict.]{.underline}185 Citizens often show a significant risk
aversion in comparison to their government. While surveys are
notoriously difficult to collect and interpret, existing data suggest
that the public has little support for nuclear weapons use,186 but
strong support for action against climate catastrophe.187 We can further
show that when citizens deliberately engage with the subject at hand,
their concern and readiness for action often increases.188 [For example,
citizen assemblies on climate change have recommended widespread
policychanges across sectors, amendments to incentive structures and
laws against ecocide to reach emissions targets]{.underline}.189 Indeed,
many lament that when it comes to genetically modified organisms and
nuclear power, citizens are far too risk-averse.190 The problem is not
that the public is riddled with cognitive biases that make them
unconcerned about global catastrophes.

**[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought.]{.underline}**
Navigating humanity through crises will involve many value-laden
decisions under deep uncertainty. Democratic procedures can deal with
such hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be represented
amongst scholars of ERS. Recommendations on policies that would reduce
risk should be passed through deliberative assemblies and await the
approval of a wider pool of ordinary citizens, as they will be the ones
who will bear this risk. A homogenous group of experts attempting to
directly influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

#### Perm do both -- the net benefit is [resilience:]{.underline} combining philosophy with policy reduces the risk of extinction scenarios AND creates adaptation strategies.

Contributions and Limitations of Law and Policy Tools for Existential
Risks

[While our deconstruction of existential risks leads to fairly broad
claims, it also provides a few concrete questions and
insights]{.underline}. First and foremost, if existential risks can
indeed be triggered by nonexistential hazards, we need to broaden the
scope of investigation in order to draw a more accurate roadmap of the
existential risks field: one which can deal with questions of
vulnerability and exposure explicitly.

Second, the type of perceived challenge channels the range of
appropriate responses which can be developed. While existential hazards
may appropriately be met by narrower forms of technical solutions and
technologically-oriented mitigation strategies, our broader perspective
of existential risks open up other toolboxes to confront existential
risks. In particular, **[social vulnerability and human driven
(anthropogenic) exposure require improved governance and coordination
for adaptation strategies]{.underline}**. Thus, when we reconstruct
existential hazards through the optics of the social systems' inability
to withstand them they, per definition, become social phenomena. **[As
noted, many existential risk scholars have recently recognised the
importance of reaching out to, and incorporating, law and governance
approaches, even where the origin of the existential hazard itself is
technological]{.underline}**. **[The critical role of such law and
governance approaches should be even more self-evident]{.underline}**
[where the problems in question --- the origins of existential
vulnerability and exposure --- are themselves social, not
technological.]{.underline}

**[This opens up a field for law and governance scholars to work more
productively and on an equal footing with technical experts and
philosophers]{.underline}**. [Moreover, this allows for a different set
of research questions to be posed as to how we might reduce the
vulnerabilities underlying the existential risks against humanity, and
our collective exposure to hazards leading to existential
outcomes]{.underline}. In doing so, our taxonomy has the potential to
elevate relevant aspects of otherwise mundane considerations within
politics, economics and society to the plane of existential risks. In
garnering this attention, we hope that **[law and policy tools might be
more productively incorporated and deployed as a means to building
resilience and robustness]{.underline}**. Here, central legal
institutions as rights, responsibility and societal relations might in
fact contribute substantially to reducing both our vulnerability
towards, and exposure to, existential risks.

The obvious limitations of this approach reside in the observation that
many contemporary existential hazards, vulnerabilities and exposures are
anthropogenic. This raises the spectre of either "iatrogenesis"
("\[complications\] caused by the healer"), where our attempts at
treating a problem accidentally give rise to new, potentially worse
ailments. Thus, in our attempt to curtail existential vulnerabilities
and exposures, we may inadvertently generate new or different
existential risks. Yet, the framing remains critical: the vantage points
created in our proposed taxonomy encourages alternative ways of thinking
about existential risks and provide different accommodation strategies.

[Finally, the perspective provided by existential vulnerabilities might
also foster solutions that will be of more general benefit to humanity
as tangential effects of efforts taken to reducing our collective
vulnerability and exposure to existential risks]{.underline}. While this
appears to be of a lower order of concern at first flush, our taxonomy
appears to bind existential risks together with phenomena occurring at
different levels. In this sense, existential vulnerabilities and
exposures may possess fractal characteristics,82 reflecting the
complexity of their constitution. Support for this claim might reside in
the scalability of hazards and vulnerabilities in particular: if
pedestrian threats can cascade into existential outcomes, for example,
then mundane measures might feedback to reinforce humanity against
existential risks. Pushing this to its limits, it is possible the
seemingly oblique effects of improved governance undertaken to shore up
existential vulnerabilities actually end up as one of the very sources
of humanity's resilience and robustness against existential outcomes.

Concluding Thoughts

The lessons that we can draw from deconstructing existential risks into
hazards, vulnerabilities and exposures can be divided into internal and
external lessons for the field of existential risk research.

In terms of the lessons for existential risk research, our taxonomy
suggests that we may presently reside in a situation of pervasive risk.
In identifying the catalogue of existential hazards looming over
humanity, and focusing attention to confronting these challenges, the
perception is that the outcome of these efforts is a lowering of the
overall probability of an actualised existential risk. If our efforts
are not actually achieving this, however (because they do not address
vulnerabilities or exposures, only direct hazards), we run the risk of
achieving safety that is merely "symbolic": we perceive that we are "all
clear" --- that we have successfully steered humanity past "existential
outcomes" --- when we are in fact all the more fragile. [Defeating a
global pandemic, or securing mankind from nuclear war, would be historic
achievements; but they would be hollow ones if we were to succumb to
social strife or ecosystem collapse decades later]{.underline}. **[By
proposing alternative paths that lead to existential outcomes, our
taxonomy can recalibrate the calculus and reduce the prospect of an
existential outcome.]{.underline}**

Our taxonomy also provides the groundwork for concrete strategies for
meeting the existential challenges revealed by our deconstruction of
existential risks. In essence, our taxonomy enables more productive
cross-disciplinary cooperation amongst researchers from the existential
risk community and various other disciplines, in assessing the dynamics
that might lead towards catastrophic or "existentially adverse"
outcomes.

**[This step in itself seems to enhance resilience and robustness by
fostering greater variety of policy and governance responses ---
responses which can move beyond mitigation alone, to extend to
adaptation, and which can better anticipate the strengths and weaknesses
of governance]{.underline}**. Two key limitations latent within such
approaches need to be acknowledged. First, that these new perspectives
to confronting existential risks import ingrained societal and
institutional problems manifest in lower orders of problems. Second,
that the additional complexity introduced into the field of existential
risks necessarily makes attempts at framing responses more difficult.
The payoffs of such a trade-off are open for discussion.

LIMITS OF RESURGENCE

[Resurgence is not an uncontested process, but more than opposition from
settler governments and reactionary 'unsettled' settler people, there
are clear critiques of some practices and articulations of
resurgence.]{.underline} Perhaps the clearest and most concise of these
is from Lightfoot (2020), who refers to a 'pessimism trap' in some of
the core scholarly works on resurgence. Lightfoot begins by identifying
an over-reliance and misapplication of Fanonian thought in the works of
three key resurgence scholars: Alfred (2005), Corntassel (2007, 2008)
and Coulthard (2014). [By applying a degree of militantism that
Lightfoot critiques as unwarranted and rejecting any engagement with the
state whether domestically or in the international sphere, **the
horizons of Indigenous resurgence movements are limited and, in fact,
trapped in an endlessly agonistic position with respect to the
state.**]{.underline} Lightfoot also identifies that these works take
hard lines on political 'purity' issues, juxtaposing authentic and
co-opted individuals and movements, ignoring the complex lived realities
of Indigenous People in a settler colonial dominated society. **[By
contrast, Lightfoot offers up]{.underline}** [the dynamic creation of
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People ('the
Declaration') as being driven by both]{.underline} [**grassroots and
institutional actors, requiring cooperation with** a variety
of]{.underline} **[state powers and]{.underline}** [entities and with
the potential to create significant change for]{.underline}
**[Indigenous communities]{.underline}** [despite the continued
existence of the settler state.]{.underline}

It is important to note here that Lightfoot's critiques are largely the
articulations of scholars who, while influential to many Indigenous
activists, also describe their individual versions and visions of
resurgence. As we have discussed here, resurgence takes place in a
myriad of forms. It can include working through institutions like
universities, many of which have served as extensions of the state to
colonise Indigenous knowledge. The successful carving out of space for
Indigenous thought and resurgence-based education in and around the
established system of higher education and the way that this relies on,
for one example, state funding of Indigenous students' tuitions
demonstrates that the complete rejection of the state and drawing of
hard lines of purity are not actually required for resurgence actions to
function. However, Lightfoot is correct in pointing out that there are
risks of resurgence becoming reified into an unreachable standard of
activism that can, ultimately, badly demotivate many grassroots people
(Bobel, 2007).

In the same way that decolonisation risks being used metaphorically and
expansively and, in so doing, becoming drained of all political and
material meaning (Tuck & Yang, 2012), **[resurgence risks becoming
rigidly defined and inaccessible.]{.underline}** For example, urban
Indigenous communities who cannot easily access territories for
traditional land-based practices may find the discourse alienating. The
same can be said for reconnecting Indigenous People who have been
severed from culture by pro cesses like residential schooling and
out-adoption.9 These Indigenous communities find ways to work creatively
with settler communities outside of the strict confines of the state. In
fact, these Indigenous People come to resurgence through academia, as is
the case for the scholars Lightfoot critiques.

While drawing hard lines on many issues may be counter-productive, one
of the few hard lines that resurgence-based approaches generally agree
on is the need for the political economy of state-supported capitalism
to be eliminated from Indigenous lands. As Coulthard (2013) popularly
articulated in his provocative blog post titled 'For our nations to
live, capitalism must die', capitalism is positioned as 'parasitic' on
Indigenous lands and Peoples.10 Here, Coulthard references settler
colonisation's historical and current role in fuelling global
capitalism. As a postcolonial scholar, Gurminder K. Bhambra (2011) has
said, the development of the 'modern' world--- including the idea of
modernity itself, industrial capital, and global networks of power and
commodities---is the result of the confluences brought about by European
imperialism and colonialism. Colonisation of the Americas, Australia and
elsewhere set in motion consumptive and expansionist settler economies
premised on capitalist ownership of property and exploitation of
'frontier' spaces often in the form of resource extraction, such as the
environmentally destructive production of oil from tar sands in places
like Alberta (Preston, 2013). It is important not to conflate settler
colonialism and capitalism---at the risk of colonial formations
'shapeshifting' to rely on non-capitalist economics while maintaining
settler colonial narratives and structures of ownership and Indigenous
dispossession (Barker, 2021). Nevertheless, it is generally agreed
across articulations of resurgence that capitalism poses a direct threat
to Indigenous lands and lives through environmental destruction and
impoverishment. It also displaces and detracts from traditional
Indigenous economic systems. Returning here to resurgence based on the
revitalisation of traditional food systems, the goal is not simply to
have a sufficient amount of food but to revitalise larger land-based
practices that centre on food, including international trade in
foodstuffs. For example, as Sam, Schmeisser and Hare (2021) state, the
oolichan grease trails--- trails used by nations who caught and
preserved oolichan, or candlefish, to trade the resulting and highly
prized 'oil' or 'grease' with other nations for different goods---
represent more than just transportation routes. Rather, they are also
the material basis for place-knowledge of multiple environments. They
are bound up in histories of international cooperation and trade and
systems of knowledge dissemination in the form of storytelling and oral
history. While it is possible, as Sam et al. (2021) assert, to
revitalise these trade networks with the assistance of digital
technologies (in this case, what they call the Grease Trail Digital
Storytelling Project), resurgence-based analysis suggests that what is
not possible is revitalising these trade networks within a political
economy dominated by capitalism

That said, what could be accurately described as Indigenous resurgence
movements continue to grow and exert an important influence on local,
national and international politics. Indigenous communities are
increasingly turning to land-based activism, even in times of crisis.
For example, the Cheslatta community of the Dakelh Nation, in what is
currently called British Columbia, reoccupied a traditional lake-side
village site in 2020. This was done without permission or help in order
to isolate and protect the community elders from the COVID-19 pandemic.
[**In other contexts, it is possible to draw direct lines between acts
of resurgence and changes to government policy,** especially in relation
to the overlaps between policing and security on the one hand and
Indigenous claims to land and territory on the other]{.underline}.
Consider that [the land reclamation at Ipperwash Park by the Stoney
Point Ojibway community in 1995 led]{.underline} not only
[to]{.underline} the unjust murder of community member Dudley George but
also to [the Ipperwash Inquiry in 2003. This inquiry made over 100
recommendations, including that the governments of Canada and Ontario
apologise to and compensate the Stoney Point community and recognise
that their land was unjustly appropriated over 60 years
prior]{.underline}---a recognition that might never have occurred
without the land occupation. Further, **[the recommendations in that
report]{.underline}** concerning policing Indigenous communities engaged
in reclamations or protests **[were crucial to preventing the escalation
of violence between Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officers and Six
Nations of the Grand River community members during the occupation of
the Douglas Creek Estates housing development in 2006]{.underline}**.
While these recommendations have not had the blanket effect of
preventing police violence against Indigenous nationhood movements---for
example, the repeated raids on the Wet'suwet'en encampments in the path
of oil and gas pipelines in the interior of British Columbia in
2019---[it is undeniable that Indigenous communities are freer to engage
in land reclamation and nation-building projects than they were
previously.]{.underline} When the range of resurgence activities is
considered, from the educational programs of Dechinta to grassroots
efforts to revitalise wild rice around the Great Lakes to the WWOS
installations and ceremonial renaming of places like PKOLS, the
potential of Indigenous resurgence movements to create social change
should not be ignored.

7.1 Ontological vulnerability

**[The category of ontological vulnerability denotes intrinsic
vulnerabilities associated with human existence]{.underline}**. These
include the possibility that we inhabit a computer simulation,56 which
might be terminated or altered at any time. [More conceptual and basic
vulnerabilities --- so fundamental that we often would not even consider
them as such --- include our existence as biological beings that are
dependent]{.underline} (potentially more so than other species such as
tardigrades) on continuous or relatively uninterrupted inputs of energy
and resources (such as food, water, air, light, ...), which renders the
human species one comparatively vulnerable to "extinction" events such
as a supervolcano --- or meteor-induced global winter. On a deeper level
yet, all biochemistry is dependent on the existing laws of physics
within which it evolved, rendering us acutely and terminally vulnerable
to any processes (e.g. vacuum decay) which would profoundly alter these
processes. Biological deterioration due to ageing processes or exterior
damages might also rank amongst these, although that is conditional on
whether or not there exists a physical "hard ceiling" to how far medical
senescence research might extend human lifespans and reduce other
vulnerabilities.

[As **these are background conditions at the frontiers of
epistemology**, we are unlikely to be able to unveil more than a
fraction of these vulnerabilities]{.underline}. Also, as inherent
features of human existence we have limited abilities to act effectively
in this category. Perhaps the most utility we can extract from
delimiting ontological vulnerability is to restrict its reach: in other
words, to leave this as a residual class of vulnerabilities inherent in
existence.

7.2 Vulnerabilities, passive and active; Built, institutional and
cultural

Passive vulnerabilities are characterised by inaction: the
susceptibility to existential outcomes by virtue of failure to take
appropriate measures. Conversely, active vulnerabilities arise in
association with human activities, as by-products or unintended
consequences. Three cross-cutting sub-distinctions can also be made for
both passive and active vulnerabilities: built, cultural, and
institutional. Built vulnerabilities are characterised by our (passive)
failure to put into place relevant solutions or defences to existential
challenges, or by our (active) failure to repair or correct the extant
vulnerabilities in the legacy infrastructures we deploy, or the
path-dependent ways we deploy them --- even if we have such solutions or
repairs at our disposal. Such solutions can in fact include some
interventions proposed by the existential risk research agenda, such as
an asteroid defence programme or the ability to systematically monitor
for supervolcano eruptions;57 they also cover the active existential
risks posed by the technologies which humanity has introduced, but which
go unfixed --- such as architectural deficiencies creating intractable
cybersecurity vulnerabilities in universally used computing chips.
Because of the technical nature of engineered vulnerabilities, some of
these are perhaps closest to the existing (policy) research agenda of
the existential risk community --- and at present some may consider that
law and policy tools have less of a role to play, other than to
coordinate efforts aimed at addressing them.

In contrast, top-down vulnerabilities resulting from suboptimal
direction and coordination are captured by our sub-category of
institutional vulnerability. Here, the line between active and passive
is admittedly thin, where recklessness can be the distinguishing
feature. Active institutional vulnerability may be characterised by
failure to coordinate to address a known risk, such as climate change,
or cyclical global economic meltdown. Passive institutional
vulnerability may then be understood as directional and coordination
failures that limit the scope of knowledge related to existential risks
--- perhaps an implicit "unwillingness to know", which translates in an
unwillingness to fund blue-sky research into charting "unknown
unknowns".58

Cultural vulnerability encompass the bottom-up societal dimensions,
reflecting how certain social practices may affect susceptibility to
existential challenges. Active cultural vulnerabilities include
customary practices that facilitate the spread of pathogens, increasing
susceptibility to pandemics --- for example, integrated commercial
travel networks and interpersonal greeting rituals which encourage
physical proximity or contact. Passive cultural vulnerabilities include
the exclusion or ridicule of existential risks from serious discussion
in public forums (let alone the halls of power). This increases
collective vulnerabilities insofar as the public and policymakers
underrate the prospects for existential risks,59 resulting in further
marginalisation.

7.3 Intended vulnerabilities

[Intended vulnerabilities are those which are created or retained
specifically for that purpose, and within the existing research agenda
are reflected in the premises of the "AI risk" or "Apocalyptic AI"
movement]{.underline}.60 Another salient example can, however, be found
in nuclear force postures which (in the US context) features
centralisation of launch command authority along with a
"launch-on-warning" doctrine that relies on input from fallible early
launch warning systems.61 Together, this gives rise to the catastrophic
risk of an accidental nuclear war.62 Yet, far from incidental, this is
arguably by design. As the theorist Kenneth Boulding once observed: "if
\[deterrence\] were really stable ... it would cease to deter. If the
probability of nuclear weapons going off were zero, they would not deter
anybody".63, 64 The nuclear force knowingly renders itself more
vulnerable to catastrophic accidents --- sacrificing a degree of safety
for the sake of strengthening operational readiness and deterrence. Less
dramatic, similar intentional vulnerabilities could emerge from a state
intelligence service knowingly holding back back-doors or
"zero-day-exploits" which it identifies in critical infrastructure
software, in the hope that this may enable more effective cyberattacks
against rival states at a later state.

7.4 Existential vulnerability: Mitigation and adaptation strategies

**[This taxonomy of vulnerabilities can provide concrete suggestions for
addressing existential risks]{.underline}**. While the categories of
ontological and intended vulnerabilities may seem superfluous, their
treatment as additional classes allow limited resources to be
concentrated into the most tractable areas. Perhaps the main
contribution of this taxonomy is to highlight how existential risks need
not be active and discernible, in the manner of the "hazards" identified
in the field. Instead, many of these risks can be latent, and
slow-moving. [Moreover, this taxonomy aids in understanding how human
activities can impact paths towards "existential outcomes" in several
ways: (1) intent: by directly creating technologies which pose
existential hazards (i.e. emerging technologies such as AI,
nanotechnology and synthetic biology); (2) (negligence) by establishing
complex systems for which failure is unavoidable;65 (3) and by omission,
the failure to take steps to confront existential risks.]{.underline}

Beyond merely refining the sources of existential risks, the
contribution of this taxonomy lies in creating a roadmap for the study
and integration of risks that have not yet received much or consistent
attention in the field of existential risks. In doing so, we emphasise a
number of existential vulnerabilities, such as global dependency upon a
few species of staple crops, or certain types of globalised technologies
(e.g. SCADA-based systems in critical infrastructure) that are not
commonly recognised as sources or failure points of existential risks.

The study of existential "vulnerability" may suggest that adaptation
strategies are preferable to those of mitigation, both because of the
inherent complexity underlying both forms of structural vulnerability
and because adaptation can now occur simultaneously with mitigation.
This is because the vulnerability analysis in effect opens up a parallel
system where other trajectories of existential risks are at play. The
rough equivalence drawn between traditional existential risks with
existential hazards might have the effect of underselling adaptation
strategies: it is illogical to conceive of robustness as a defence
against the apocalypse, after all. Along with efforts to mitigate or
avert existential hazards, however, **[we can now also plan for
adaptation against vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. Thus, adaptation
strategies are not limited to actions undertaken after "the Fall":
instead, **[they may become rational reactions towards limiting
susceptibility to existential risks.]{.underline}** In order to explore
this potential further, we proceed to examine a taxonomy of exposure.

A Taxonomy of Existential 'Exposure'

As a parallel effort to our taxonomy on existential vulnerabilities, we
set out a classification system to differentiate between different forms
of exposure. It is worth recalling at this point that we use exposure to
express the interface between hazards and vulnerabilities --- between
what kills us, and how we die. Both hazards and vulnerabilities in
isolation remain as potentials: exposure is thus a means of actualising
such potential into existential risks.

Such exposure can further be directed towards either the societal or the
natural environment. This is about what is directly at risk: our (human)
society and the common capabilities and support structures preventing
existential risks, or nature and its carrying capacity and resilience to
future shocks. Thus, we assert that devastating results for humankind
can follow from the collapse of both the societal structures we have
built, as well as the natural environments within which these
constructed systems are embedded. **[Again, the distinction allows us to
single out different examples and trajectories to build alternative
strategies for human survival. As is clear from the examples above, it
also draws out lessons for existential outcomes which might not be
immediately evident from an analysis of existential hazards
alone]{.underline}**. For example, when "exposure" is seen from the
perspective of the natural environment on which mankind depends,
pervasive over-fishing and deforestation, combined with trends in
resource demands tracking population growth, may become potentially
hazardous activities with the potential to curtail human development in
the long run,66 even if they do not affect most humans directly in the
short run.

### Extinction Rhetoric Good -- Climate Change

#### Extinction risk assessment for climate change is good 

**Lewis, et al, Research Scientist with Enviornment and Climate Change
Canada, 2021**

\[Ilona, "Treatment of climate change in extinction risk assessments and
recovery plans for threatened species", Society for Conservation
Biology, April 20th, 2021, access info
\[[[https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.450]{.underline}](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.450)\]

**[Climate change is contributing to substantial impacts on biodiversity
and]{.underline}** is recognized as **[an accelerant of
extinctions]{.underline}** (Scheffers et al., 2016; Urban, 2015). Our
understanding of the consequences of this newer emergent threat is
evolving rapidly; extinction risk assessments need to integrate this
knowledge into formal assessment processes. **[Despite
this]{.underline}**, our **[results indicate that climate change was the
third least identified threat]{.underline}** in Canadian extinction risk
assessments and that for **[nearly half]{.underline}** [(43.5%) **of all
reports climate change was not mentioned at all**]{.underline}. Further,
we found that **[the threat of climate change was inconsistently
assessed over time]{.underline}** and across taxonomic groups. [While
more recent recovery documents increasingly recommended climate-targeted
actions, the majority were indirect actions not specifically aimed at
threat abatement or improving population viability.]{.underline} Given
the pervasive nature and ongoing amplification of this threat its
inclusion in species risk assessments is imperative to improve the
status of climate-threatened species. **[Failure to integrate knowledge
of climate change impacts into formal assessment processes and
subsequent recovery plans could magnify extinctions risks for all
species.]{.underline}** Our results point to the importance of applying
standardized methods, such as the IUCN threat classification scheme
(i.e., threats calculator), in extinction risk assessment processes. We
found a strong positive relationship between the use of the threats
calculator and the probability that climate change was identified as a
threat. **[Application of standardized processes helps to ensure that
decision-making practices, such as listing species for legal protection,
are informed by consistent, repeatable and transparent
criteria]{.underline}** (Mace et al., 2008; Mothes et al., 2020).
Despite the importance of using standardized criteria for threat
classification, it has been typically overlooked (Hayward, 2009; Murray
et al., 2014). Use of standardized threat classifications could reduce
taxonomic bias as species are assessed across a similar set of criteria
in a transparent manner. We did not focus our analysis on whether
interactions between threats were considered, yet accounting for
potential interactions between climate change and non-climate change
driven threats is salient given the potential for synergistic effects
(Foden et al., 2018). Although current guidance recommends that
cumulative impacts be considered when using the threat classification
scheme (COSEWIC, 2019), it is not clear whether this occurs in practice,
and previous work on IUCN Red List assessments suggests threats are
primarily considered independently (Trull et al., 2018).

### Link Turn -- Scientific Knowledge

#### Science innovation and research while adopting Indigenous knowledge key to developing new policies that work with Indigenous communities, not around

Researchers have a vital role to play in this context. [By documenting
environmental inequalities, generating localized data and centering
Indigenous knowledge, research conducted in true partnership with
Indigenous communities can serve as a powerful catalyst for advocacy,
policy change and transformative action.]{.underline}

By drawing on [new legal frameworks such as the [environmental justice
law or the right to a healthy
environment](https://fr.davidsuzuki.org/blogue/mobilisation-populaire-permet-obtenir-le-droit-a-un-environnement-sain-au-canada/),
scientists can help shape public policy]{.underline}, support
community-led advocacy [and co-develop solutions grounded in the lived
realities of the North.]{.underline}

**[The next generation of Arctic research must be conducted in true
partnership with Inuit communities as knowledge-holders, decision-makers
and innovators.]{.underline}** It is o[nly by grounding science in
Indigenous sovereignty]{.underline} and justice that we [can create
solutions that are truly sustainable, equitable and responsive to local
realities.]{.underline}

[Collaborative research, conducted with---not on---Inuit communities is
the only path forward.]{.underline} It must be grounded by the
principles of justice, reciprocity, respect for rights and Indigenous
sovereignty over ancestral knowledge.

### Utilitarianism Good

#### Util is morally right -- it's a form of egalitarianism which means that aff's impacts come first.

Egalitarianism: The doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal
rights and opportunities

NIE: Non-intrinsic egalitarianism

[To show that util]{.underline}itarianism [is not a form of
egalitarianism, one would have to find criteria for a theory to be a
form of egalitarianism that util]{.underline}itarianism [fails to meet.
Here is a review of possible such criteria]{.underline}, and a summary
of this paper's arguments with respect to them.

a\. [Egalitarian theories favour more equal distributions of well-being.
This is true of some egalitarian theories, but as a necessary condition
for a theory's being egalitarian it is flawed]{.underline}: [it does not
capture our intuitive commitment to equality, or the aims of real-world
egalitarian movements]{.underline}, as is shown by WEALTHY MAN.

b\. [Egalitarian theories consistently provide reasons to favour more
equal distributions of wealth]{.underline}. [Given DMU of wealth and the
effects of relative poverty, util]{.underline}itarianism [meets this
criterion]{.underline}. Those reasons are sometimes outweighed, but this
is true of all plausible egalitarian theories.

c\. [Egalitarian theories favour more equal distributions of something
intrinsically. This is not true of util]{.underline}itarianism, [but
neither is it true of NIE or relational egalitarianism]{.underline}.

d\. [Where egalitarian theories do not favour more equal distributions
of something intrinsically, they favour them reliably, in virtue of deep
social facts. Util]{.underline}itarianism [meets this criterion at least
as well as NIE]{.underline}.

e\. [Where egalitarian theories do not favour more equal distributions
of something intrinsically, they favour egalitarian social
relations]{.underline}. [Util]{.underline}itarianism [meets]{.underline}
this criterion, [given the effects on well-being of inegalitarian social
relations, suggested by empirical studies and various plausible theories
of well-being.]{.underline}

f\. [Where egalitarian theories do not favour more equal distributions
of something intrinsically, they favour egalitarian social relations
intrinsically]{.underline}. [Util]{.underline}itarianism [does
n]{.underline}o[t]{.underline} [meet]{.underline} this criterion, [but
this is unimportant, since it can still mandate policies to mitigate or
eliminate them]{.underline} (in most cases), [account for the
regrettableness of their instantiation]{.underline} (in all cases) [and
explain their great significance.]{.underline}

I conclude, [then]{.underline}, that [we should treat utilitarianism as
a form of egalitarianism. No longer should utilitarians ignore
egalitarian concerns, or utilitarianism be rejected for ignoring
them.]{.underline}

#### Flattening DA: Fatalist approaches to understanding the settler colonial paradigm [locks out]{.underline} the possibility of decolonization by '[putting politics to death]{.underline}'. Reifying colonial relations as transhistorical meta-structures [flattens]{.underline} agency and [perpetuates]{.underline} domination.

Scholars have long reckoned with [the ambivalence of the settler
colonial situation, which is simultaneously colonial and postcolonial,
colonizing and decolonizing]{.underline} (Curthoys, 1999: 288). Given
the generally dreadful Fourth World circumstances facing many indigenous
peoples in settler societies, it could be argued that there is good
reason for such pessimism. The settler colonial paradigm, in this sense,
offers an important caution against celebratory narratives of progress.
Wolfe (1994), it must be recalled, wrote the original articulation of
his thesis precisely against the idea of 'historical rupture' that
dominated in Australia post Mabo, and was thus as much a scholarly
intervention as it was a political challenge to the idea of Australia
having broken with its colonial past. Nonetheless, [the fatalism of the
settler colonial paradigm-- whereby decolonization is by and large put
**beyond the realms of possibility** has seen it come under considerable
critique for reifying settler colonialism as a **transhistorical
meta-structure** where colonial relations of **domination are
inevitable**]{.underline} (Macoun and Strakosch, 2013: 435 ; Snelgrove
et al., 2014: 9). Not only does Wolfe's [ontology erase contingency,
heterogeneity and (crucially) agency]{.underline} (Merlan, 1997; Rowse,
2014), but [its polarized framework effectively '**puts politics to
death**']{.underline} (Svirsky, 2014: 327). In response to such
critiques, Wolfe (2013a: 213) suggests that 'the repudiation of
binarism' may just represent a 'settler perspective'. However, as
Elizabeth Povinelli (1997: 22) has astutely shown, it is in this regard
that [the totalizing logic of Wolfe's structure of invasion rests on a
disciplinary gesture where 'any discussion which does not insist on the
polarity of the \[settler\] colonial project' is assimilationist, worse
still, genocidal in effect if not intent.]{.underline} [Any attempt to
'explore the dialogical or hybrid nature of colonial subjectivity'--
which would entail working beyond the bounds of absolute polarity-- is
disciplined as complicit in the settler colonial project itself, leaving
'the only nonassimilationist position one that adheres strictly and
solely to a critique of \[settler\] state discourse'.]{.underline} [This
gesture not only **disallows the possibility of counter-publics and
strategic alliances**]{.underline} (even limited ones), [but also comes
dangerously close to '**resistance as acquiescence**' insofar as the
settler colonial studies scholar may malign the structures set in play
by settler colonialism, but only from a safe distance unsullied by the
messy ambivalences and contradictions of settler and native
subjectivities and relations.]{.underline} Opposition is thus left as
our only option, but, as we know from critical anti-colonial and
postcolonial scholarship, **[opposition in itself is not
decolonization.]{.underline}**

#### Depictions of an [insular]{.underline}, [Western]{.underline} IR essentializes divisions\-\--blocks [revisions]{.underline} of the world order AND ALT solvency.

Economics and Political Science, \"Imperial Dialectics and Epistemic
Mapping: From Decolonisation to anti-Eurocentric IR,\" European Journal
of International Relations, Vol. 26, Issue 2, June 2020, SAGE.
\[language modified\]

Like Senghor and the early Du Bois, [anti-Eurocentric scholars
often]{.underline} **[reproduce]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[imperial division of the world]{.underline}** [when]{.underline}
**[invoking]{.underline}** [the non-Western]{.underline}. In emphasising
difference, anti-Eurocentric [scholars occlude access to the **values**,
**practices** or **political projects**]{.underline} [-- good or bad --
that]{.underline} **[cut across]{.underline}** [or have
been]{.underline} **[shared]{.underline}** [by people in]{.underline}
[the global North and South]{.underline}. While
**[essentialism]{.underline}** of this kind [might sometimes
seem]{.underline} [politically necessary]{.underline} -- at least in the
short term -- [its reliability as knowledge needs to be]{.underline}
[more closely interrogated]{.underline}.

To an extent, the [incentive structure to]{.underline} **[add
alternatives]{.underline}** [in the form of]{.underline} **[non-Western
alternatives]{.underline}** [is passed down by]{.underline}
**[mainstream]{.underline}** [IR theorists]{.underline}. For example,
mainstream realists who have essentialised the 'character' of
non-Western nations as a limit on the expansion of Western universalism
(e.g. Huntington, 1997; Kissinger, 2014; see Reus-Smit, 2017) can
provoke responses valorising non-Western universalisms. Or mainstream
realists who argue that non-Western IR can offer nothing that Western IR
does not already (e.g. Mearsheimer, 2016) can provoke a proliferation of
exceptions in the form of ethnic and cultural particularisms.

Though not all anti-Eurocentric IR scholars are equally incautious about
epistemic mapping, [it is]{.underline} **[broadly
practised]{.underline}** [and seemingly]{.underline}
**[difficult]{.underline}** [to avoid]{.underline}. [Epistemic mapping
is]{.underline} [brought in to offer]{.underline} **['global' or
'post-Western' alternatives]{.underline}** to IR's 'analytical
bifurcations' -- such as West/East, theoretical/atheoretical,
subjective/objective -- [but actually]{.underline}
**[elaborates]{.underline}** [on these bifurcations]{.underline}.7 When
[Acharya]{.underline} points to constructivism's role in 'opening space
for scholarship on the non-Western world' because of its emphasis on
'culture and Identity' he [is drawing on an]{.underline}
**[older]{.underline}** [bifurcation based on the notion that
while]{.underline} [the West has 'knowledge', the non-West has
'culture']{.underline} (Acharya, 2014b: 650). Similarly, Yaqing
[Qin]{.underline} (2018) **[reproduces]{.underline}** [a familiar
stereotype about the West operating from a]{.underline}
[knowledge]{.underline} **[culture of 'rationality']{.underline}**,
[whereas China operates from an]{.underline} **[epistemology of
'relation']{.underline}**. Robbie [Shilliam]{.underline} has been a
foremost scholar in pointing out the different uses of the Western, and
the inherent problems of representing an authentic non-Western removed
from colonial history (2010). However, in his recent work, the Black
Pacific, he [claims the ability]{.underline} (though not unproblematic)
[to speak for the]{.underline} **[lived experiences and 'living
knowledge traditions']{.underline}** [of Maori and Pasifika
peoples]{.underline}. These living knowledge traditions, Shilliam
argues, provide access to an epistemic alternative to 'Western
modernity', supposedly free of 'Western' hierarchy or violence
(Shilliam, 2015: 7--12). These [claims]{.underline} sometimes [come
with]{.underline} **[troubling assertions]{.underline}** [of a hegemonic
national philosophy or religion as the]{.underline}
**[basis]{.underline}** [for epistemic difference]{.underline}. For
example, Confucianism is equated with Chinese in a manner that
celebrates a particular representation of national identity and buries
internal contestation and the myriad historical forces that shaped
contemporary China. Note, for example, that Qin's book on Chinese IR
contains no reference to international communism or Mao Zedong as
intellectual or cultural influences on modern China.

Other varieties of epistemic mapping allow for 'hybrid' forms of social,
political and economic organisation, but retain the essential origin of
the individual components. For example, [Agathangelou and Ling's
invocation of]{.underline} **['Asian capitalism']{.underline}**, [which
they]{.underline} [conceptualise as the result of 'mater liberalism's
consummation with the Confucian]{.underline} [world-order' creates
a]{.underline} **[hybrid category out of two
essentialisms]{.underline}** (2004: 27). Contrast this with
[Fanon]{.underline}, who **[refused]{.underline}** [to concede rightful
ownership of human knowledge]{.underline} to [particular peoples,
regions or civilisations]{.underline}.

The [way]{.underline} that the [debate is]{.underline}
**[structured]{.underline}** [around these divisions leaves it poorly
guarded]{.underline} [against the]{.underline} **[double-edged
valence]{.underline}** [of difference]{.underline}. [Reduction of
difference to ethnic and cultural categories]{.underline} (including
European) can [lead to]{.underline} **[reduction]{.underline}** [of
groups to their worst practices]{.underline}, to [virtuous caricatures,
or \[dismantle\]]{.underline} ~~disable~~ [the critiques of anyone seen
to be]{.underline} **[outside]{.underline}** [these groups]{.underline}.
That different societies have produced different cultural
particularities is not in doubt; however, the [meanings
that]{.underline} **[intellectual origin]{.underline}** [claims carry
are ambiguous and can be put to many different uses]{.underline}.
Ancient Greece, for example, provides some of the major foundations of
dominant Western thought, but in its historical context it had more
cultural, intellectual and political links with the civilisations of
Asia Minor and Egypt. Both of these [statements can be true, yet both
can be]{.underline} **[emphasised in different ways]{.underline}** [for
different effects]{.underline} (for example, see Duara, 1996: 40; Young,
2016; 33).

Take the claim, sometimes obliquely made, that non-Western perspectives
are distinct sources of cultural cohesion, spirituality or moral
insight. For example, Arlene Tickner's assertion that

> modern Western belief systems are based upon an instrumental
> relationship between human beings (subject) and nature (object) that
> translates into the instrumentalisation of knowledge or the view of
> knowledge as a commodity. Instead, many non-Western cosmogonies view
> the self, community and nature as interdependent parts of a single
> whole, with which their understanding of the relationship between
> knowledge and the natural world, and of the social function of
> knowledge in general, is markedly different (Tickner, 2003: 305).

Such a [claim is]{.underline} **[not only essentialist]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} **[politically ambiguous]{.underline}**. [Imperial
authorities]{.underline} [made]{.underline} **[similar]{.underline}**
[claims about non-Western worldviews]{.underline} in order
[to]{.underline} **[justify]{.underline}** [exclusion on
the]{.underline} [grounds that 'natives' were]{.underline} **[ill-adept
for modernity]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} also [to cast doubt on
the]{.underline} [authenticity of 'Westernised' native
critics]{.underline}. [It is unlikely that Tickner means to
essentialise]{.underline}; [however, the]{.underline}
**[characterisation of the non-Western]{.underline}** [as more attuned
to]{.underline} [communal values and]{.underline} the [natural world
emerges from the]{.underline} **[dialectical impetus]{.underline}** [to
define]{.underline} the [particular non-Western against the particular
Western]{.underline}. The [definition of the Western as]{.underline}
**[rational and universalist]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} also
[constructed, and is]{.underline} **[complicated]{.underline}** [by any
close]{.underline} [inspection of the variety of]{.underline}
communitarian [religious beliefs, anti-modern sentiment and]{.underline}
[counter-Enlightenment philosophy]{.underline} within modern Europe and
the West. On the other hand, [many non-Westerners]{.underline} also
[see]{.underline} **[knowledge as a commodity]{.underline}**.
[Commodification]{.underline} of knowledge [is]{.underline}, therefore,
[not]{.underline} **[explicable]{.underline}** [purely in terms of
ethno-cultural thought systems]{.underline}.

This raises the related point that the [non-Western
alternatives]{.underline} being [defined need not be]{.underline}
**[insular or 'communitarian']{.underline}** [in order to be
essentialisms]{.underline}. The [claim is not that the 'non-Western'
circumscribes]{.underline} **[too narrow]{.underline}** [a section of
humanity, but that it]{.underline} **[carves up the world]{.underline}**
[into separate realms]{.underline}, which are [coded according to some
ingredient that defines]{.underline} [them in contradistinction to the
Western]{.underline}. [Arguments]{.underline} that [non-Westerners have
their own]{.underline} **[universalisms]{.underline}** (Acharya, 2014b:
649--650), [alternative sources of]{.underline}
**[cosmopolitanism]{.underline}** (Munro and Shilliam, 2010)
[or]{.underline} **[local humanisms]{.underline}** (Nakano, 2010)
[demonstrate that]{.underline} [political globalism is]{.underline}
**[universal]{.underline}**, [regardless of whether or not its
universality can be]{.underline} [evaluated as]{.underline} serving
[progressive or conservative, emancipatory or oppressive political
aims]{.underline}. However, attributing specific global visions to a
particular social or historical experience supposedly shared by people
with the same race and culture only makes sense within a politicised
discourse where the value of the non-Western has been somehow
challenged.8

Then there are [definitions of epistemic difference]{.underline}
**[based on 'lived experience']{.underline}**. [Although an improvement
on]{.underline} **[territorial or raciological]{.underline}** [accounts,
the]{.underline} **[ascription]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [cultural
difference to]{.underline} a generic lived experience or social
subjectivity [can]{.underline} also **[reduce]{.underline}** [groups of
people to]{.underline} **[stereotypes and monolithic value
sets]{.underline}**. This is evident in the work of some scholars who
take Fanon primarily as a source of 'epistemic blackness', without fully
addressing his concerns about racialisation and the geopolitical
dimensions of decolonisation. For example, the philosopher Lewis R.
Gordon writes that 'Fanon's body. . . is a subtext of all his writings.
... Anxiety over embodiment is a dimension of Western civilization
against which Fanon was in constant battle. The [body, he laments,
is]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[denied presence]{.underline}**, [and
black people are a denied people']{.underline} (Gordon, 2015: 8). [Even
in **as sophisticated**]{.underline} [an]{.underline}
**[analysis]{.underline}** [of Fanon as Gordon's]{.underline}, [there is
a **danger of essentialism**]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the
[association of black identity with a particular way of
thinking]{.underline}. [For Fanon,]{.underline} [black people were not
so much]{.underline} **[universally]{.underline}** ['denied' as
relegated to certain roles within]{.underline} a [social
hierarchy]{.underline} -- the French empire most specifically. Blacks
could be of higher or lower status, but race was the basis for social
relegation, which alienated the subject from a full, dynamic humanity.
For Fanon, [every]{.underline} **[particular experience]{.underline}**
[is an instantiation of the]{.underline} [universal, and]{.underline}
his [analysis]{.underline} of his own experience [is a demand to
be]{.underline} **[recognised as a fellow human with an equal stake in
humanity]{.underline}**. [Blackness is not a]{.underline}
**[generalisable]{.underline}** **[perspective]{.underline}** [from
which we can derive a]{.underline} **[non-Western
knowledge]{.underline}**, [but a reminder to]{.underline}
[pay]{.underline} **[attention]{.underline}** [to the social and
historical specificity of relation]{.underline}.9

[Embodiment arguments are]{.underline} usually [the]{.underline}
**[vehicle]{.underline}** [for Fanon's presence in IR, and are
often]{.underline} [accompanied with the claim that]{.underline}
**[non-Westerners have profoundly different ways of]{.underline}**
**[practising]{.underline}** [politics or being modern]{.underline}. For
example, Vivienne Jabri (2014) invokes Fanon to theorise the 'embodied
presence' of non-Western agency within international order. Anna
**[Agathangelou]{.underline} (**2016) [links]{.underline} **[different
aspects]{.underline}** [of Fanon's revolutionary dialectics to
his]{.underline} [conception of the subjugated black body]{.underline}.
She is particularly interested in how Fanon's conception of racial
experience might present alternatives or 'different' ways of doing
politics (Agathangelou, 2016: 111; cf. Sekyi-Otu, 2009). In a similar
argument, John M. Hobson contrasts the 'different critique' of
'African-American Marxists', including Du Bois, with 'white Eurocentric
institutional thinkers' like Leonard Woolf (Hobson, 2012: 17, n. 20).
However, the [difference is]{.underline} **[not as stark]{.underline}**
as Hobson might hope. It is true that Woolf's anti-racism was qualified
by a belief in elite institutional development, but so was Du Bois's
anti-imperialism.10 [Areas of overlap are]{.underline}, thus,
**[obscured]{.underline}** [by the assumption that there
are]{.underline} **['black' and 'white' ideas]{.underline}**, [which can
be]{.underline} **[mapped]{.underline}** [onto generic 'black' and
'white' social]{.underline} [realities]{.underline}.

[Aside from its]{.underline} **[dubious reliability]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[problem]{.underline}** [with epistemic mapping is
essentially the]{.underline} [same as the problem with]{.underline} the
**[ethnicised counter claims]{.underline}** of Du Bois or Senghor: [it
is too]{.underline} [amenable to the purposes of]{.underline}
**[imperial ordering and elite representation]{.underline}**. [It
creates]{.underline} [and services the two worlds of Said's orientalist
divide, rather than building an agenda]{.underline} [based
on]{.underline} **[analytical]{.underline}** [approaches
that]{.underline} **[constructively]{.underline}** [problematise the
divide]{.underline}.

Logics of epistemic coexistence

Fanon's [concerns about]{.underline} **[imperial
coexistence]{.underline}** [continue to have]{.underline}
**[relevance]{.underline}** [in the way that]{.underline}
[anti-Eurocentric scholars]{.underline} **[represent]{.underline}** [the
relationship between Western and non-Western]{.underline} epistemes.
Associations of Western and non-Western with specific traits are
[reinforced by]{.underline} **[scholarly prescriptions of how the two
ought to interact]{.underline}**. Anti-Eurocentrism is, therefore, an
ethos as well as an analytical approach. [Anti-Eurocentric
scholars]{.underline} tend to [make arguments]{.underline} both [in
favour and against peaceful integration]{.underline} of the non-Western
and the Western. [Claims]{.underline} that the [non-Western must make
itself]{.underline} **[autonomous]{.underline}** from the Western (e.g.
Mignolo, 2009), or that non-Western IR must be added as a complement to
Western IR to produce a more 'inclusive and diverse' discipline (e.g.
Acharya, 2014, 2016) both [tend to presuppose]{.underline} that [the
Western and non-Western]{.underline} **[exist 'out there']{.underline}**
[as de-contested and fixed]{.underline} (or, at least, de-contestable
and fixable) [realms of social and political]{.underline}
[inquiry]{.underline}.11 [Each]{.underline} in its own way can
**[reproduce]{.underline}** [imperial coexistence and
recognition]{.underline}, Fanon's 'seat at the master's table' and
Said's orientalist division of the world.

Anti-Eurocentric coexistence reproduces an imperial image of the world
based on a non-West, which is spiritually rich, radically pluralist and
organically socialist, and a West, which is hierarchical, absolutist and
secular. [Anti-Eurocentric scholars]{.underline} sometimes
**[essentialise]{.underline}** [the Western as a political and
philosophical force that is]{.underline} **[chauvinistic at its
root]{.underline}** (e.g. Hobson, 2012; Maldonado-Torres, 2008; Mignolo,
2011). These [approaches]{.underline} [suggest a]{.underline}
**[fundamental antagonism]{.underline}** [between Western and
non-Western, but, in]{.underline} doing so, [produce]{.underline}
**[flattened]{.underline}** [images of each]{.underline}. It then
follows that steps must be taken to rid or purify the non-Western of
embedded Western traits. [Calling this a]{.underline} **[promotion of
coexistence]{.underline}** [may seem counter-intuitive]{.underline}.
[Mignolo]{.underline}, for example, [is certainly]{.underline} **[very
critical]{.underline}** [of the Western, and]{.underline}
[extrapolates]{.underline} from this a professed desire for a different
world. However, [his critique comes]{.underline} [with the]{.underline}
**[assumption]{.underline}** that [the Western cannot or should not be
transformed in any]{.underline} [fundamental way]{.underline}. Rather,
[the Western is]{.underline} **[fixed and essentialised]{.underline}**
[as an object of binary]{.underline} [opposition]{.underline}. New
universalisms of pluralism and horizontality must be derived from
non-Western thought systems, putting the Western in its place and
leaving it alone (although, see Rojas, 2016).

Alternatively, scholars who favour non-Western diversification of social
and political inquiry sometimes argue that purportedly 'non-Western'
traits, such as 'relationality', can be added to 'the Western' in order
to act as a mediating force on 'its' violence. Coexistence here is not
only the prescribed mode of interaction, but it is the contribution that
non-Western culture is making to the discipline. These
[scholars]{.underline} recognise conflict between West and non-West, but
often [downplay or ignore]{.underline} the **[power dynamics and
structural inequalities]{.underline}** [within representations of
Western and non-Western.]{.underline} [Take Ling's]{.underline} Daoist
[dialectics]{.underline}, which, though it makes the valuable offer of
liminal identities between East and West, nevertheless [reinscribes the
divide by]{.underline} **[assigning ownership of relational
conceptions]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [non-Western thought
systems]{.underline}. Ling writes that Western political 'common sense'
offers only intellectual resources for violence towards difference, not
for recognition and negotiation (Ling, 2013: 12, 15). Strategies for
negotiation -- perhaps for any constructive, mutually affirming
political relations -- must, therefore, be taken from non-Western
thought systems, such as Daoism and the yin/yang. She does not convey
'hegemony, hierarchy, and violence' as endemic to many societies across
space and time, but 'enactments' of the dominant Western picture of the
world. But for its many evils, the Western should not be subsumed, but
balanced by the 'parity, fluidity, and ethics' offered by 'other worlds'
(Ling, 2013: 14). Here, [war and peace become]{.underline}
**[fundamentally questions of attitude]{.underline}**
[towards]{.underline} [cultural or racial difference, not]{.underline}
**[structurally]{.underline}** [determined results of historical
inequality]{.underline} [within and between societies]{.underline}.

Another [potential pitfall]{.underline} of the ethos of coexistence [is
that it elicits an]{.underline} **[open-ended demand]{.underline}** [for
a proliferation of]{.underline} **['different']{.underline}**
[perspectives, removed from the sociohistorical]{.underline} [contexts
wherein]{.underline} these [perspectives]{.underline} **[gain
meaning]{.underline}**. The [non-Western can]{.underline}, thus,
[become]{.underline} [a]{.underline} kind of **[global 'pick and
mix']{.underline}** [for epistemic diversification or institutional
strategy,]{.underline} and the specific, dialectical [relations
that]{.underline} **[elicit representations]{.underline}** [of the
non-Western are]{.underline} **[broadly]{.underline}** [passed
over]{.underline}. Unearthing different perspectives either becomes a
virtue in itself -- in the name of diversification -- or as a means of
retrieving perspectives, which will grant greater 'openness' (Bilgin,
2016: 137--138; e.g. Grovogui, 2009: 138). This is, of course, not to
say that greater openness and diversity would necessarily be
undesirable. However, [without a]{.underline} complementary **[impetus
to assess]{.underline}** these [perspectives for their ability to
produce]{.underline} [or impede a more just society, let alone whether
they are that]{.underline} **['different']{.underline}** [to begin with,
the]{.underline} [politics of pluralisation are obscured]{.underline}
(see Eun, 2019; Paipais, 2016).

There is, thus, a [danger in]{.underline} **[depoliticising
difference]{.underline}** [when making]{.underline} **[absolute virtues
out of diversity and openness]{.underline}**. While calls for diversity
might be politically constructive, [scholars should not
advocate]{.underline} a plurality of [representations of difference
without **rigorous critical analysis** of those
representations]{.underline}. Edward Said, in the same vein as Fanon,
wrote from an analytical perspective, which was highly conscious of
geopolitical imperialism, and thus critical of certain 'non-Western'
perspectives -- e.g. 'nativism' -- which he saw as detrimental to the
political project of decolonisation (1993: 275--278). While he
acknowledged that the non-West could not be reduced to an inferior or
'backwards' reflection of the West, he also did not support the
coexistence of analytical approaches, which reify non-Western difference
(orientalism) and those that treat it as a discursive and material
construct. This is because he knew that, while not the same as political
praxis, academic knowledge has the power to shape the social world it
studies, and can thus reproduce the imperial division of the world and
attendant political agendas.

### Essentialization DA

#### Euro-western conceptions of indigenous ontology [essentializes]{.underline} of indigeneity and [flattens]{.underline} the nuances of '[embodied]{.underline}, [lived]{.underline}, and [practiced]{.underline} life ways'. The liberation of indigenous people from the colonial past [needs]{.underline} to be first and foremost grounded in a [rejection]{.underline} of grand narratives.

2025 HDCSW -- TW\]

[Euro-Western thought has continued to essentialise Indigenous peoples
through an understanding of indigeneity tied to genetics, biology,
ancestry and, of course, territory. This understanding is deeply
contested by Indigenous scholars themselves]{.underline} (TallBear
2013). In this Issue, we follow multiple [Indigenous scholars and
activists in **understanding Indigenous identities to be complex**
social, cultural and political identities, formed in resistance to the
dominant structures of settler colonialism]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014;
Simpson 2017; Tuck & Yang 2012). We capitalise the term Indigenous
throughout this Issue because it is an identity name. It is a
recognition that Indigenous peoples are political communities with the
right to self-determination.

'**[Ontology suggests something essential]{.underline}**', warned our
call for papers. [Discussions at the theory school questioned if it was
possible to name distinct ontologies, identify them, and their capacity
to challenge colonial knowledge production without essentialising;
without creating categories, boundaries and binaries between 'theirs'
and 'ours'.]{.underline} Many of the submissions here problematise these
discussions. The five papers, two book reviews, and an audio arts piece
that constitute this special issue, explore Indigenous [ontologies that
challenge the colonial perspective that essentialises Indigenous
ontologies.]{.underline} Primarily featuring PhD and early career
researchers, the works in this issue stretch into the conflicted space
of academia, in order to use Indigenous thought to directly challenge
and critique academic normative ways of theorising. As Vanessa Watts
suggests to us, **['\[t\]he epistemological-ontological removes the how
and why out of the what]{.underline}** (Watts 2013: 24, original
italics)'. Where [Euro-Western theory persists in defining ontologies as
static descriptions of what 'is', many **Indigenous ontologies cannot be
separated from embodied, lived, and practiced life ways**.]{.underline}
As such, Indigenous ontologies are living; they adapt and transform and
exist in relation (Byrd 2019; Coulthard & Simpson 2016; Hunt 2014).

Agoriad translates as 'openings' and is the title of Hywel Griffiths'
poem, commissioned for this journal. It contains a perfect image for
this issue. He writes: 'and the door that should be opened / has swollen
in its frame' (Griffiths, this issue 1.2: 1). This resonates with
challenges highlighted in this introduction, where [relational and
transformative understandings (opened) are beset by stuck, static,
essential (swollen) understandings.]{.underline} 'Politics is Hard: An
interview with Professor Jenny Pickerill', printed in this issue,
expands in what ways Indigenous thought can aid the transformation of
Euro-Western traditions, moving beyond a recognition of difference and
into an application. The interview, recorded at the 2023 Gregynog Theory
School, also takes us through the anarchic activism which has informed
so much of her work. She illustrates [the patronising stereotype that
exudes from settler-coloniality, through the **prescription of what
Indigenous life ways should look like**.]{.underline} She illustrates
this modality by describing a settler critique of Indigenous use of
modern renewable energies, because this practice, through the settler
gaze, contradicts traditional sacred use of land. Similarly, Pickerill
describes the legislation around hunting Dugong in Queensland,
Australia, which only legalises the use of a spear rather than f
irearms. [This assumption of representation, Pickerill says, '**locks
\[Indigenous people\] into that colonial past**' (Pickerill & Rose, this
issue 1.10: 9) This fundamentally misunderstands that **Indigenous
ontologies are dynamic, place-based and relational**, making assumptions
about ontologies that constrain the community to a particular historic
imagination.]{.underline}

Pickerill's paper in this issue, 'Unsettling Geography: Enacting the
Politics of Indigenous Ontologies', expands on this discussion. The
article emphasises the necessity of integrating Indigenous ontologies
into the discipline of geography, positing that these perspectives
fundamentally challenge Eurocentric frameworks and colonial practices.
While contemporary geography has moved towards more interconnected and
relational understandings, there remains a significant need to
prioritise Indigenous perspectives and confront the lingering effects of
colonialism. Again, this contains [a critique of ontology as
essentialising, as **Indigenous ontologies are characterised as diverse,
context-specific, and inherently complex**.]{.underline} What is
revealed is the necessity of a deeper engagement from geographers that
transcends mere acknowledgement of difference. The title of Pickerill's
paper is itself representative of the dynamic and renewing quality of
Indigenous ontologies in their capacity to unsettle. It highlights the
importance of disrupting traditional power dynamics and the ongoing
impact of settler colonialism. This process is described as both
uncomfortable and transformative, requiring geographers to re-evaluate
how knowledge is produced and shared. [The call is for a more humble and
place-focused approach that acknowledges local struggles and intricate
relationships, **moving away from grand narratives that often
marginalise** Indigenous perspectives.]{.underline} This appreciation
for the power of small-scale action divulges Pickerill's partiality to
the anarchic activism which she discusses at length in her interview.

#### The aff's ontological framings [devolves]{.underline} 'indigeneity' into [static essentialist]{.underline} idea that's [readily co-optable]{.underline} into violent structures of neoliberalism. [Only]{.underline} a rejection of those artificial limitations can we [engender]{.underline} dynamic struggles capable of resisting the colonial state.

While geography's ontological turn re-animated more-than-human agency,
and reduced anthropocentric understandings, Essam's paper highlights a
[continued limitation of ontological framings. That is, ontologies
continue to be associated with the theoretical, and struggle to include
the cosmological.]{.underline} Quoting Sarah Hunt, she reiterates,
**['Indigeneity "is not just an idea,]{.underline}**" [it is alive,
embodied and relational involving humans and nonhumans, land and
place']{.underline} (Essam, this issue 1.6: 4). As has been discussed,
the [use of the term ontological can be limiting, particularly when it
is understood as the 'way things are' -- a presumption that implies **a
static and therefore essentialising understanding** of the
term.]{.underline} [Essam implores us to remember the multiplicity of
ontologies, Indigenous and other. There is not a singular Indigenous
ontology that can be used to decolonise Euro-Western thought;
**ontologies are uniquely place-based, dynamic and
living**.]{.underline}

Matthew Gravlin's paper, 'To Forsake Becoming: Indigenous Ontologies,
Land Defence, and the Resistance at Standing Rock', reflects on the
jeopardy of co-option. Gravlin argues that [the logic of possession is
both necessary for challenging neoliberal infrastructures and considered
incommensurable with Indigenous ontologies.]{.underline} He exposes
throughout the paper how [neoliberalism is capable of mirroring and
absorbing Indigenous practice to suit its purpose. Neoliberalism is
itself an unstable set of ideas, dynamic and flexible to suit its
purpose.]{.underline} Gravlin explores how [Euro-Western knowledge
systems have appropriated and commodified Indigenous ways of being and
particularly explores neoliberalism's retreat from state intervention
favouring governance through decentralised, adaptive
networks.]{.underline} He describes [Indigenous resilience that
'thrive\[s\], not by taking preventative action against threats, but
through exposure and adaptation to them']{.underline} (Gravlin, this
Issue 1.7:7). This troubles the relationship with neoliberalism: [if
resilience requires exposure to threat, then threat is a necessary
partner of resilience, and **neoliberalism becomes a constructive
challenge to Indigeneity.**]{.underline}

What is more, the reverse is discussed through The Standing Rock
protests of 2016. [As Indigenous mobilisations resist and attack
neoliberal infrastructures, 'the same forces absorb Indigenous
assemblages to boost their evolutionary fitness']{.underline} (Gravlin,
this issue 1.7: 10). As such, Gravlin argues, [Indigenous resistance
cannot 'transform Indigenous people's relationship to the colonial
state', nor does it 'challenge colonial power or free-market
capitalism']{.underline} (Gravlin, this Issue 1.7: 11). Instead, the
adaptive capacities of Indigenous peoples are constructed as exemplary
and are co opted as a further tool for creating adaptive and resilient
neoliberal systems.

[Gravlin's contribution argues for '**specific, nation-based
articulations of a possessing, autonomous subject**']{.underline}
(Gravlin, this Issue 1.7: 13) [as a necessary Indigenous perspective for
the task of anti-colonial struggle and particularly in resistance to
neoliberalism.]{.underline} For Gravlin, [the rejection of
possession]{.underline} (because possession only replicates Indigenous
domination) [manifests from a **static understanding of Indigenous
ontologies**. In this way, Indigenous ontologies are **constructed as
'alternatives to modernist scriptures'**, and this carries the risk of
'creating and deepening an essential divide']{.underline} (Gravlin, this
Issue 1.7: 13).

### IR -- Progress Possible

#### [NO ONTOLOGY]{.underline}. "[Green colonialism]{.underline}" is avoided in [instances]{.underline} that IR can emphasize [cultural dimensions]{.underline} in [soft law]{.underline} documents---[Indigenous exception]{.underline} clauses prove.

[Osakada (2024) examined the changes required to make the green
transition more inclusive and sustainable from an international human
rights perspective]{.underline}. Indigenous peoples have been
challenging the ways in which this transition is taking place, using the
phrase ["green colonialism." Although in many countries, it has become
common to consult affected Indigenous peoples to reach an agreement
before licensing the establishment of green energy facilities, previous
studies revealed that asymmetric power relationship between Indigenous
peoples, sovereign states and business enterprises contributed to
disguised dialogues and/or agreements among them]{.underline}.
Therefore, the meaning of the right to free, prior and informed consent
(FPIC) of Indigenous peoples should be understood correctly from an
international human rights perspective. [The distinction between
Indigenous peoples and local communities under climate regimes was
initially addressed under the UNFCCC and has recently received renewed
attention due to energy policy changes to cope with rapid climate
change. The Montana climate litigation demonstrated the possibility of
harmonizing Indigenous peoples and local communities by clearly
identifying the unique climate-related culture of Indigenous peoples and
avoiding unintentional confrontation or dichotomy, given the difficulty
of making clear distinctions and garnering sympathy from the local
community.]{.underline} Kimura (2024), however, pointed out the
Indigenous peoples themselves may not see the need for harmony. As just
energy transition alone does not automatically reflect the perspective
of Indigenous peoples, green colonialism could easily occur if their
unique rights are not considered. Negishi (2024) provides a
comprehensive exploration of the legal protection of traditional
knowledge of Arctic Indigenous peoples, emphasizing the vital role this
knowledge plays in their cultural and spiritual identity. Multi-level
legal protection of Arctic traditional knowledge was examined. [At the
international level, these include instruments like the ILO
Convention]{.underline} No. 169 and the [UNDRIP, which emphasize
cultural dimensions and self-determination, respectively. Regional legal
frameworks, which are corroborated by soft law documents, are also
included in them. At national level, Canada, Norway, Finland, and Sweden
incorporate traditional knowledge into legislation and judicial
decision. Kobayashi (2024) examined a trade dispute initiated by the
United States in 2023 concerning Mexico's nationwide prohibition on the
use of genetically engineered corn for human consumption. The analysis
focused on the scope of the legal arguments related to the Indigenous
exception clause under Article 32.5 of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(USMCA) of 2018. This clause allows state parties to deviate from other
treaty obligations, if they deem it necessary to fulfil legal
obligations to Indigenous peoples. The author argues that while
balancing values and interest is crucial for mitigating trade disputes,
Indigenous exception clauses should not be used for protectionist
purposes that ultimately hinder Indigenous participation in
international trade.]{.underline}

NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE

**[Turning to negotiation and dialogue, two Arctic examples are relevant
for consideration in other parts of the Indigenous world.]{.underline}**
Readers may want to turn their attention to the long history of
redefining Indigenous--state relations to the still-developing
conditions for the exercise of the right of self-determination of
Greenlandic Inuit.

[The Greenland Home Rule Act of 29 November 1978 is probably one of the
best examples of constructive framework legislation accommodating the
rights and aspirations of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The former
Greenland Home Rule Government, or Landsstyret, whose ministers are
elected by the Parliament of Greenland, was given extensive authority,
including veto power over development activities. Since 1978, dialogue
and Indigenous-defined agenda setting has contributed to amendments to
the original Act and the design and architecture for the eventual
independence of Greenland through the exercise of their right of
self-determination.

[Although statehood remains a future objective, it is extraordinary that
peaceful dialogue and negotiation with Inuit within the Danish realm has
yielded authority over both domestic and international portfolios that
will contribute to independence--- from ownership and control of lands,
territories and resources to a determining voice in all domestic
affairs, from education to media to municipal governments **to a
significant role in the renegotiation of United States military bases on
Inuit territory.**]{.underline} **[And all of this has been done in the
context of peaceful negotiation and dialogue, in stark contrast to the
armed conflicts typically associated with threats to the territorial
integrity of a nation-state.]{.underline}**

In 2017, in response to one of the TRC's calls to action, the Government
of Canada put in place 'permanent bilateral mechanisms' to identify
'joint priorities, co-develop policy and monitor progress' (Memorandum
of Understanding, 2017). This commitment resulted in the creation of the
Memorandum of Understanding between Canada and the Assembly of First
Nations (2017), Inuit--Crown Partnership Agreement (2017) and
Canada--Métis Nation Accord (2017).

For Inuit, this permanent bilateral mechanism3 ensures that leadership
from all four comprehensive land claim agreement regions and the
national Inuit organisation have the opportunity for high-level
discussions about their priority issues and potential solutions directly
with the prime minister and their cabinet. These meetings occur on a
regular basis and, thus far, have resulted in substantive responses to
issues and financial needs to ensure the fulfilment of the Government of
Canada's fiduciary obligations to the Inuit as a people. Natan Obed,
President of the national organisation Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has
stated: The Inuit--Crown Partnership Committee will play an important
role as we act on the priorities that matter to Inuit and Canadians.
This committee will enhance cooperation between Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami
and the federal government, allowing us to continue renewing the
relationship between Inuit and the Crown in a sustainable and positive
way. (As quoted in Office of the Prime Minister of Canada, 2017, n.p.)

[Further, the Inuit--Crown Partnership Agreement is complimented by a
significant policy intended 'to promote prosperity and support community
and individual wellbeing throughout Inuit Nunangat', consistent with
'respect and support for Inuit self-determination'.]{.underline} The
Inuit Nunangat Policy (2022) attaches to 'all federal departments and
agencies', explicitly providing clear directives on both policy and
funding of concern to Inuit, their communities and their diverse needs.
Comprehensive in nature, in addition to recognition of and respect for
Inuit self-determination, [the policy addresses Inuit approaches in
relation to priorities and inclusion in decision-making, equity, Inuit
language, research, procurement and a process for evaluation of policy
effectiveness.]{.underline} Ultimately, future outcomes should reflect
genuine equity in the status and conditions of social, economic,
cultural and political realms for Inuit throughout Canada.

LEGISLATION

[A 2021 visit to the United States 'govtrack' website revealed 29
current pieces of legislation in support of Native Americans' and Alaska
Native Tribes' collective or individual tribal concerns, ranging from
the Western Tribal Water Infrastructure Act of 2021 to the Urban Indian
Health Parity Act]{.underline}. 4 Legislation is a common pathway for
government policy to be realised but rarely includes the need for
evaluation of whether such policy actions are effective.

Although the governments of the Philippines (Indigenous Peoples Rights
Act 1997) and Cameroon (see, e.g., UN Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination \[CERD\], 2019; Office of the UN Human Rights
Commissioner, 2022) have enacted legislation and constitutional measures
to acknowledge the specific conditions of Indigenous peoples, both
remain suspect in lack of active, substantive delivery on their word.
Without question, the enactment of the Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples Act (S.C. 2021, c. 14)5 by the Government of Canada
reflects a serious objective of implementation by a democracy in this
century. [Much detailed work remains to be done to achieve comprehensive
implementation of this new federal law across diverse Indigenous peoples
of Canada, but one concrete example to align domestic law specifically
with Article 36 of the UN Declaration as initiated by Inuit is to amend
Canada's immigration legislation (Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami briefing note,
2022).]{.underline} Other concrete developments include responses to the
International Decade of Indigenous Languages, a National Council for
Reconciliation, and the establishment of the National Centre for Truth
and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba.

Desire to Dispossess Indigenous Peoples and Gain Unfettered Access to Indigenous Lands and Resources]{.underline}

In other words, colonialism by settler states is a constant, not a
variable, in both outcome and intent. Further, the state is not only
intentionally colonial, but it is also unified in its desire to co-opt
Indigenous peoples as a method and means of control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

[Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from beneftting, from their ancestral
territories']{.underline}.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not
through outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

[Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over
time]{.underline}. 'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge
and unable to deny it a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance
over the years, 'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people
closer to it'.27 According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous
leaders and 'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood
demands to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to
collaborate in the development of a "solution" that does not challenge
the fundamental imperial lie'.28

[In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism.]{.underline} Drawing
directly from Fanon, Coulthard fnds that colonialism relies on both
objective and subjective elements. The objective components involve
domination through the political, economic and legal structures of the
colonial state. [The subjective elements of colonialism involve the
creation of 'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation
by which colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it]{.underline}.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now
works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping
their perspectives in line with state discourses, rather than merely
excluding them, as in years past. [Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the
reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still
colonial insofar as it remains structurally committed to the
dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and self-determining
authority']{.underline}.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states first
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek
self-[determination. Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded
that states are deliberate and never changing in their
behaviour.]{.underline} **[With this move, Corntassel limits and
actually demeans Indigenous agency, overlooking the reality that
Indigenous organisations themselves chose the human rights framework and
rights discourse as a target sphere of action precisely because, as was
evident in earlier struggles like slavery, civil rights or women's
rights, these were tools available to them that had a proven track
record of opening up new possibilities and shifting previous state
positions and behaviour.]{.underline}** **[Indigenous advocates also
cleverly realised, by the 1970s, that the anti-discrimination and
decolonisation frames could be used together against
states]{.underline}**. [States did, in no way, nefariously impose a
rights framework on Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. **[Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
deliberately chose to frame their self-determination struggles within
the human rights framework in order to bring states into a double bind
where they could not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim
that they uphold equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous
peoples' human rights and leaving them with a diminished and unequal
right of self-determination]{.underline}**. **[But, because he is caught
in the pessimism trap of seeing the state only as unified, deliberate
and unchanging, Corntassel overlooks and diminishes the clear story of
Indigenous agency and the potential for positive change in advancing
self-determination in a multitude of ways.]{.underline}**

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic 'Resurgence' Versus
the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

All of these [writers advocate Indigenous resurgence, through a
combination of rejecting the current reconciliation politics of settler
colonial states, coupled with a return to land-based Indigenous
expressions of governance as the only viable, 'authentic' and legitimate
path to a better future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
decolonisation.]{.underline} While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however[**, all three theorists are also
caught in the same three pessimism traps:** authenticity versus
co-option; a vision of the state as unifed, deliberate and never
changing in its desire to colonise and control; and a view of engagement
with the state as futile, if not dangerous, to Indigenous sovereignty
and existence]{.underline}. **[When combined, these three pessimism
traps aim to inhibit Indigenous peoples' engagement with the state in
any process that could potentially re-imagine and re-formulate their
current relationship into one that could be transformative and
post-colonial, as envisioned by the UN Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}**. **[The pessimism traps together work
to foreclose any possibility that there could be credible openings of
opportunity to negotiate a fairer and just relationship of co-existence
with even the most progressive state government.]{.underline}**

[This pessimistic approach is not innocuous. By overemphasising
structure and granting the state an enormous degree of agency as a
unitary actor, **this pessimistic approach does a remarkable disservice
to Indigenous resistance movements by proscribing,**]{.underline} [from
academia, an extremely narrow view of what Indigenous self-determination
can and should mean in practice]{.underline}. **[By overlooking and/or
discounting Indigenous agency]{.underline}** [and not even considering
the possibility that Indigenous peoples could themselves be calculating,
strategic political actors in their own right,]{.underline} and
vis-à-vis states, **[the pessimistic lens of the resurgence school
unnecessarily, unproductively and unjustly limits the feld of
possibility for Indigenous peoples' decision-making, thus actually
countering and inhibiting expressions of Indigenous
self-determination]{.underline}**. By condemning---writ large---all
Indigenous peoples and organisations that wish to seek peaceful
co-existence with the state, negotiate mutually benefcial agreements
with the state, and/or who have advocated on the international level for
a set of standards that can provide a positive guiding framework for
Indigenous-state relations, **[the pessimistic lens of resurgence
forecloses much potential for new and improved relations, in any form,
and is very likely to lead to deeper conficts between states and
Indigenous peoples, and potentially, even violent action]{.underline}**,
[which Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome.]{.underline} **[The
pessimism traps of the resurgence school are therefore, likely
self-defeating for all but the most remote and isolated Indigenous
communities]{.underline}**. Further, this approach is quite out of step
with the actions and vision of many Indigenous resistance movements on
the ground who have been working for decades to advance Indigenous
self-determination, both domestically and globally, in ways that
transform the colonial state into something more just and may eventually
present creative alternatives to the Westphalian state form in ways that
could respect and accommodate Indigenous nations. **[Rather, it aims to
shame and blame those who wish to explore creative and innovative
post-colonial resolutions to the colonial condition]{.underline}**.

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration
or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 after 25
years of development. The Declaration is ground-breaking, given the key
leadership roles Indigenous peoples played in negotiating and achieving
this agreement.45 Additionally, for the frst time in UN history, the
rights holders, Indigenous peoples, worked with states to develop an
instrument that would serve to promote, protect and affrm Indigenous
rights, both globally and in individual domestic contexts.46

[Many Indigenous organisations and movements, from dozens of countries
around the world, were involved in drafting and negotiating the UN
Declaration]{.underline} and are now advocating for its full
implementation, both internationally and in domestic and regional
contexts. In Canada, some of the key organisational players---the Grand
Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), the Assembly of First Nations, and
the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, or their predecessor
organisations---were involved in the drafting and lengthy negotiations
of the UN Declaration during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. [In the United
States, organisations like the American Indian Law Alliance and the
Native American Rights Fund have been involved as well as the Navajo
Nation and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who represent themselves as
Indigenous peoples' governing institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami
Council and the Sami Parliaments all play a key role in advancing
Indigenous rights. In Latin America, organisations like the
Confederación de Nationalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the
Consejo Indio de Sud America (CISA) advocate for implementation of the
UN Declaration.]{.underline} The three, major transnational Indigenous
organisations--- the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, the
International Indian Treaty Council and the Inuit Circumpolar
Council---were all key members of the drafting and negotiating team for
the UN Declaration, and the latter two, which are still in existence,
continue their strong advocacy for its full implementation.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires fundamental and significant change, on both the international
and domestic levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights
essentially calls for a complete and fundamental restructuring of
Indigenous-state relationships, it expects states to enact and implement
a signifcant body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy
changes that can accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights,
free, prior and informed consent, redress and a variety of
self-government, autonomy and other such arrangements.
**[States]{.underline}** are not going to implement this multifaceted
and complex set of changes on their own, however. They **[will require
signifcant political and moral pressure to hold them accountable to the
rhetorical commitments they have made to support this level of
change]{.underline}**. They will also require ongoing conversation and
negotiation with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest the process
becomes problematically one-sided. Such processes ultimately require
sustained political will, commitment and engagement over the long term,
to reach the end result of radical systemic change and Indigenous state
relationships grounded in mutual respect, co-existence and reciprocity.
This type of fundamental change requires creative thinking, careful
diplomacy, tenacity, and above all, optimistic vision, on the part of
Indigenous peoples. [The pessimistic approaches of the resurgence school
are ultimately of little use in these efforts, other than as a
cautionary tale against state power, of which the organisational players
are already keenly aware]{.underline}. **[Further, by dismissing and
discouraging all efforts at engagement with states, and especially with
the blanket accusations that all who engage in such efforts are
'co-opted' and not 'authentically' Indigenous, the resurgence school
actually creates unnecessary negative feelings and divisions amongst
Indigenous movements who should be pooling limited resources and working
together towards better futures]{.underline}**

For decades, Inuit communities have warned global governments of the
existential threats that they face---threats that also have global
repercussions. For example[, Inuit organizations play a key role in
international efforts seeking to regulate chemical substances, including
the]{.underline} Stockholm and Minamata Conventions, [as well as the
Arctic Council and the International Maritime Organization.]{.underline}

Thanks to their historic and contemporary efforts, as well as the
broader mobilization of Indigenous and allied voices across the country,
[we are beginning to see meaningful shifts in how laws are developed,
especially in terms of whose voices are included in decision-making
processes. In a notable step forward, Canada passed its [first
environmental justice law last
year](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/strategic-policy-branch/environmental-justice.html).]{.underline}

[This law provides a crucial tool for advancing the wellbeing of Arctic
communities by requiring that environmental decisions made by the
Canadian government take into account local realities, **Indigenous
knowledge** and the systemic inequalities that affect health, food
security and the broader human environment.]{.underline}

[Another significant victory for the right to a healthy environment was
recently secured through the [Canadian Environmental Protection
Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-15.31/).]{.underline}

[For Arctic communities, the recognition of this right under federal law
provides]{.underline} a critical [legal foundation to demand
environmental policies]{.underline} and program[s that reflect their
unique living conditions,]{.underline} address the persistent pollution
threatening their health [and]{.underline} the need to [protect the
ecosystems their ways of life depend on.]{.underline}

Through this legislative reform, [the federal government]{.underline}
has also [acknowledged that certain communities---especially Indigenous,
racialized and remote ones---are disproportionately affected by
environmental damage]{.underline}. While imperfect and still
insufficient, t[hese changes to the law pave the way for a more

The Arctic must be fully included in -- and benefit from -- this
evolving legal landscape. Whether in terms of plastic pollution,

communities experience a disproportionate share of the environmental
harms.

The prescription for decolonization -- that is, a normative project
committed to the liberation of the colonized and the overturning of
colonial relationships of power (Kohn and McBride, 2011: 3) -- is indeed
one of the most counter-hegemonic implications of the settler colonial
paradigm as applied to Israel-Palestine, potentially shifting it from a
diagnostic frame to a prognostic one which offers a 'proposed solution
to the problem, or at least a plan of attack' (Benford and Snow, 2000:
616). [What]{.underline}, however, [does the settler colonial paradigm
offer by way of envisioning decolonization?]{.underline} As Veracini
(2007) notes, [while settler colonial studies scholars have sought to
address the lack of attention paid to the experiences of indigenous
peoples in conventional historiographical accounts of
decolonization]{.underline} (which have mostly focused on settler
independence and the loosening of ties to the 'motherland'), [there is
nevertheless a 'narrative deficit' when it comes to imagining settler
decolonization]{.underline}. While Veracini (2007) relates this deficit
to a matter of conceptualization, [it is apparent that the structural
perspective of the paradigm in many ways closes down possibilities of
imagining the type of social and political transformation to which the
notion of decolonization aspires.]{.underline} In this regard, [there is
a worrying tendency]{.underline} (if not tautological discrepancy) [in
se]{.underline}ttler [col]{.underline}onial [studies, where the **only
solution** to settler colonialism is decolonization]{.underline} --
[which a **faithful adherence to the paradigm renders largely
unachievable, if not impossible.**]{.underline}

To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to return to Wolfe's
(2013a: 257) account of [settler colonialism as guided by a 'zero-sum
logic whereby settler societies]{.underline}, for all their internal
complexities, uniformly [require the elimination of Native
alternatives']{.underline}. [The structuralism]{.underline} of this
account [has immense power as a means of mapping forms of injustice and
indignity as well as strategies of resistance and refusal,]{.underline}
and [Wolfe is careful to show how transmutations of the logic of
elimination are complex,]{.underline} variable, [discontinuous and
uneven.]{.underline} **[Yet]{.underline}**, i[n seeking to elucidate the
logic of elimination as the overarching historical force guiding
settler-native relations there is an]{.underline} operational [weakness
in the theory, where]{.underline}by such a [logic is simply
there,]{.underline} omnipresent and manifest [even when]{.underline}
(and perhaps especially when[) it appears not to be; the settler
colonial studies scholar need only read it into a situation or
context.]{.underline} It [thus hurtles from the past to the present into
the future, never to be fully extinguished until the native is, or until
history itself ends. There is thus a powerful ontological]{.underline}
(if not metaphysical) [dimension to Wolfe's account,]{.underline} where
[there is such thing as a 'settler will' that]{.underline} inherently
[desires the elimination of the native and the distinction between the
settler and the native can only ever be categorical, founded as it is on
the 'primal binarism of the frontier']{.underline} (2013a: 258). It is
here that the differences between earlier settler colonial scholarship
on Israel-Palestine and the recent settler colonial turn come into
clearest view. While Jamal Hilal's (1976) Marxist account of the
conflict, for instance, engaged Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in
terms of their relations to the means of production, Wolfe's account
brings its own ontology: the bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction becomes
that of settler/native, and the class struggle the struggle between
settler, who seeks to destroy and replace the native, and native, who
can only ever push back. Indeed, [if the settler colonial paradigm views
history in similar]{.underline} teleological [terms to the Marxist
framework]{.underline}, [it does not offer the same hopeful vision of a
liberated future.]{.underline} After all, s**[ettler colonialism has
only one story to tell -- 'either total victory or total
failure']{.underline}** (Veracini, 2007).

Veracini's attempt to disaggregate different forms of settler
decolonization is revealing of the difficulties that come along with
this zero-sum perspective. It is significant to note that beyond settler
evacuation (which may decolonize territory, he cautions, but not
necessarily relationships) the picture he paints is a relatively bleak
one. For Veracini (2011: 5), [claims for decolonization from indigenous
peoples in settler societies can take two broad forms: an 'anti-colonial
rhetoric expressing a demand for indigenous sovereign
independence]{.underline} and self-determination\...[and an
''ultra''-colonial one that seeks a reconstituted partnership with the
\[settler state]{.underline}\] and advocates a return to a relatively
more respectful middle ground [and ''treaty'' conditions'.]{.underline}
While [both,]{.underline} he suggests, [are tempting strategies in the
struggle for change, though 'ultimately ineffective against settler
colonial structures of domination' (]{.underline}2011: 5), it is the
latter strategy that invites Veracini's most scathing assessment. As he
writes,

> under settler colonial conditions th[e independent polity is the
> settler polity and sanctioning the equal rights of indigenous peoples
> has historically been used as a powerful weapon in the
> denial]{.underline} of [indigenous entitlement]{.underline} and in the
> enactment [of various forms of coercive assimilation.]{.underline}
> T[his decolonisation actually enhances the subjection of indigenous
> peoples\...it is at best irrelevant and at worst detrimental to
> indigenous peoples in settler societies]{.underline}. (2011: 6--7)

The 'primal binarism of the frontier' plays a particularly ambivalent
role in Veracini's (2011: 6) formulation, where [the categorical
distinction between settler and native obstructs the 'possibility of a
genuinely decolonized relationship']{.underline} (by virtue of its
lopsidedness) [yet is a necessary political strategy to guard against
the absorption of indigenous people into the settler fold, which would
represent settler colonialism's final victory.]{.underline} [The
battle]{.underline} here i[s between a 'settler colonialism]{.underline}
\[that\] [is designed to produce a fundamental discontinuity as its
''logic of elimination'' runs its course until it actually extinguishes
the settler colonial relation' and an anti-colonial struggle that 'must
aim to keep the settler-indigenous relationship going']{.underline}
(2011: 7). In other words, **[the categorical distinction produced by
the frontier must be maintained in order to struggle against its
effects.]{.underline}** [Given the lack of options presented to
indigenous peoples]{.underline} by Veracini (2014: 315), his conclusion
that [settler decolonization demands a 'radical, post-settler colonial
passage' is perhaps not surprising -- although he has 'no suggestion as
to how this may be achieved and \[is\] pessimistic about its
feasibility'.]{.underline}

Beyond settler colonialism, this [inattention to]{.underline} the
[ideologically mediated character of political epistemology]{.underline}
also [tends to displace]{.underline} other [valuable analytics by
divorcing them from historically grounded accounts of **material
reproduction.**]{.underline} To take only one example,
[Mignolo]{.underline} likewise [treats capitalism as a form of
knowledge]{.underline} that he labels as "economic coloniality," [rather
than the material practices]{.underline} and forms of productive power
that secure the process of "self-valorizing value" (i.e., profit-making
and accumulation) in partthrough colonial conquest. In general,
Mignolo's suggestion here is that racism and patriarchy ought to be
apprehended as ontological-qua-epistemological hierarchies, as opposed
to social practices of defining disposable and exploitable populations
that vary (alongside and with class formation) with social formations or
regimes. [The tendency to posit]{.underline} these [a priori meta-logics
**reduce** what other thinkers have productively theorized as quite
**material structures of colonial and racial capitalism**]{.underline}
(Bhambra, 2021a; BurdenStelly, 2020; Ulas Ince, 2018) to "economic
coloniality" from which one has an "option" to escape the thought
patterns thereof.

5 MIGNOLO'S EPISTEMIC POLITICS

In this section, I further connect these theoretical disagreements to
their political implications. One of the central questions underlying
the MCD project has been an open-ended one about how to refashion
critique in a less Eurocentric key: "What should 'critical theory' be
when the damnés de la terre are brought into the picture" (Mignolo,
2010a, p. 303). I will argue, however, tha[t Mignolo's version of
decolonial thought does not really function as critique with respect
to]{.underline} at least [two desirable criteria for a specific critique
of colonial power relations: (1) the capacity to account for the
**objective** and **subjective** dimensions of the experiences of
domination that colonized actors articulate through struggles over the
terms of social and political relations and (2) the capacity to account
for how beneficiaries of relative power **disavow our/their location in
such relations**]{.underline}, [which is fundamental to
obscuring]{.underline} (and producing via "feedback loops" or recursive
processes) [those oppressive social and political
structures.]{.underline} My claim is that [the historical account and
central analytic of power that is articulated in the
framework]{.underline} of de/coloniality subtly [undercuts
both]{.underline} of these [criteria]{.underline}. Instead, [readers are
left with a project that gives preference to "epistemology" over a
thorough examination of **structural** and **political** settlements and
social forces that constrain and shape the conditions for thought and
action.]{.underline} I refer to Mignolo's tendency to privilege
epistemology in this particular mode as an "epistemic politics."

As to point (1), [Indigenous]{.underline} studies [scholars]{.underline}
engaged in otherwise very different projects such as Simpson (2014),
Byrd (2011), Speed (2017), Coulthard (2014), and Estes (2019) have
nevertheless all [theorized settler colonialism as an ongoing set of
practices premised on an unyielding subjection to land dispossession and
territorial occupation.]{.underline} They all underscore structural
continuity across historically variable strategies of colonization.
[Indigenous scholars and activists]{.underline} also [espouse an
intergenerational political project of resurgence and
resistance]{.underline}, which foregrounds the interpretive and material
task of severing these structurally unbroken links between colonial
past, present, and future. By contrast, [Mignolo]{.underline} flatly
rejects this conception of decolonization. He [dismisses "any act or
project of decolonization" that refers to an "indeterminate domain of
'reality'"]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2011, p. 54). [Such a claim redirects
readers to a critique of colonial categories as **cognitive illusions,**
that is, as pernicious **epistemic inventions.**]{.underline}
**U**ltimately, [the latter formulation misapprehends]{.underline} the
crux of [this relationship between the]{.underline} intergenerational
experience of specific, [material axes of colonial violence and the task
of theorizing (de)colonization]{.underline}. More broadly still, it is
precisely attention to a (intersubjective but no less "real") domain of
reality---which includes the imaginary as a product of social
life---that matters when considering the political stakes of
decolonization. Critical social and political theory is about "resisting
reality," in the words of feminist philosopher Sally Haslanger (2012)[.
Without this kind of orientation to material realities, the valuable
project of remedying deep colonial epistemic injustice]{.underline} (see
Bhambra, 2021b) [becomes highly attenuated]{.underline} from the
sociality and claims-making at issue in mobilization [around
anticolonial demands, such as enforcing Indigenous sovereignty and
treaties and returning stolen land]{.underline} ("land back")

My second criteria, point (2), focuses on the way that those who benefit
from intergenerational projects of colonial
erasure---["settlers"]{.underline}---[are]{.underline} far [more
inclined to disavow those structures by denying the constitutive
structural antagonisms in which we/they are situated.]{.underline}
Mignolo aims to distance epistemological questions from what he casts as
a more conventional sociological way of tracking the reproduction of
power in and through discursively generated knowledge claims. To return
as a case in point to a formulation I have already quoted: "What matters
is not economics, or politics, or history, but knowledge. Better yet,
what matters is history, politics, economics, race, gender, sexuality,
butit is above all the knowledge that is intertwined in all these
practical spheres that entangles us to the point of making us believe
that it is not knowledge that matters but really history, economy,
politics, etc." (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018, p. 135) (my emphasis). Here, I
take it that [Mignolo is arguing that]{.underline} a central obstacle to
remedying colonial epistemic injustice is [an overfocus on patterned
material practices to the point that they are reified as social
reality.]{.underline} The issue with [this]{.underline} claim is that
i[t downplays the real dilemmas faced by differently situated
constituencies,]{.underline} [when they seek to undo their practical
participation in and/or subjection to structures of colonial
violence.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, unlearning certain epistemological
biases comprises part of the latter project---say, for example,
hierarchies that place formalized written histories over oral histories
as valid evidence in juridical forums (Nichols, 2020). Yet, it is the
partially interest-based constitution of differentiated, power-inflected
perceptions of social phenomena that critical theorists assess in
diagnosing why certain pathological knowledge-forms are so difficult to
dislodge and why they are reproduced in time and space. More concretely
stated, [the turn to coloniality as a purely epistemic register of
critique directs significant interpretive attention away from the
crucial fact that settler epistemic and aesthetic disavowal of the
grounds of Indigenous mobilization and critique are part-and-parcel of
settlers' long-term accumulation of material and intergenerational
wealth through removal and displacement.]{.underline}

#### Epistemic alternatives not only obscure exploitation and racial oppression, but also reinforce reactionary academic hierarches that block revolutionary praxis needed to dismantle colonial structures.

Whatever its insights, there are various aspects of DS that are, at
best, unconvincing, on both theoretical and political grounds. For
example, its epistemological framing of ontology asserts the primacy of
knowledge in the creation of the modern world, positing that concepts
are themselves constitutive of reality. As Mignolo writes: 

What matters is not economics, or politics, or history, but knowledge.
Better yet, what matters is history, politics, economics, race, gender,
sexuality, but it is above all the knowledge that is intertwined in all
these praxical spheres that entangles us to the point of making us
believe that it is not knowledge that matters but really history,
economy, politics, etc. Ontology is made of epistemology. That is,
ontology is an epistemological concept.

Further, \[coloniality\] is written not by guns and armies but by the
words that justify the use of guns and armies, convincing you that is
for the good, the salvation, and the happiness of humanity. Such is the
task of the rhetoric of modernity. 

DS argues that [the denial of human status (and of being) to the Other
is fundamentally the result of the coloniality of
knowledge.]{.underline} Because [thinking is being]{.underline} (at
least according to the famous Cartesian formula), e[pistemic denial or
erasure amounts to an act of ontological denial]{.underline}. [But DS
theorists do not mean the same thing by 'ontology' as do most
philosophers]{.underline}, i.e. that it is the study of
the *nature* and *possibility* of being[. For DS, 'ontology' instead
refers to being *itself*.]{.underline} As the late David Graeber writes
in an essay responding to the anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro,
whose 'decolonial anthropology' rests on a similar understanding,
[theorists of the epistemic turn 'adopt a tacit ontology which seems
indistinguishable from philosophical idealism]{.underline}'. [Thus,
changing the world, for them, ultimately simply means changing the terms
of the conversation]{.underline}*.* And [while Mignolo
insists]{.underline} that [his de-linking does have a material
dimension, it is never]{.underline} quite [clear where exactly this
materialism appears in his theory.]{.underline}

While DS might sound plausible at first, there is a certain tension
between the emancipatory aims to which it pledges allegiance, the
theoretical framework that it proposes, and its proponents'
positionality in the international (and intellectual) division of
labour[. What are the implications for anti-imperialist struggle in the
global South if those at the forefront of challenging the Eurocentricity
of knowledge production are based in the resource-hoarding universities
of the global North ( especially the US**)? Is there not a danger of
reproducing precisely the kind of epistemic coloniality from which we
are trying to de-link?** And what are we to make of DS' reliance on a
deferential version of standpoint theory, whose narrow focus on
'spokespeople from marginalised groups' could]{.underline}, as Olúfemi
O. Táíwò has argued, [prevent us from bringing those voices into the
centre whose exclusion DS claims to be fighting against?]{.underline}

Táíwò is by no means the only one concerned with the 'elite capture at
scale' enabled by the distorted standpoint theory he calls 'standpoint
deference'. In 'Reflection on the Practices and Discourses of
Decolonisation', a forcefully argued critique of DS, the Bolivian
Anarcho feminist 8

[Using the idea of 'internal colonialism', Casicanqui shows how Mignolo
has built a **'small empire within an empire'**]{.underline} [-- a
formation that perpetuates coloniality in Latin America by 'enthroning'
decolonisation within the academy.]{.underline} [In his unapologetic
appropriation and depoliticisation of the work of radical indigenous
scholarship]{.underline} -- like that of Cusicanqui [-- Mignolo thus
marginalises scholars and activists from the debates that they
themselves started and in which they are still engaged]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} in turn [limits the imaginative power and
emancipatory potential of decolonisation.]{.underline}

[DS]{.underline} [thus reproduces a 'conditional inclusion']{.underline}
-- [a]{.underline} sort of ['second-class citizenship that moulds
subaltern imaginaries and identities into the role of ornaments through
which the anonymous masses play out the theatricality of their own
identity'.]{.underline} [By reducing indigenous peoples to the marginal
status of minorities, 'noble savages' or 'guardians of nature', scholars
like Mignolo and Walsh effectively exclude them from modernity and the
crucial struggles that are waged within it]{.underline}. By contrast,
while Cusicanqui concedes that 'modern history meant slavery for the
indigenous peoples of America', she nonetheless insists that this does
not mean that modernity itself cannot be a site for the articulation of
counterhegemonic indigenous projects of modernity. There remains a
possibility for the creation of what Cusincanqui calls a 'more organic'
modernity -- one that does not create an absolute dichotomy between
modern and indigenous epistemologies, as Mignolo and Walsh often do. 

[On closer inspection, then, DS turns out not to be an emancipatory
discourse at all. In fact, if one is inclined to take any perspective
that holds on to even the smallest commitment to the idea of revolution,
it is openly **reactionary**]{.underline}. In *The End of Cognitive
Empire*, de Sousa Santos goes so far as to proudly proclaim that [the
epistemological turn in DS is a reversal of Marx' famous statement in
Thesis Eleven of the *Theses on Feuerbach*, that philosophers have
interpreted the world,]{.underline} but that the point is to change it. 

[\[Marx'\] thesis would become the cornerstone of Western-centric
critical thinking, claiming the centrality of the concept of praxis as
the synthesis between theory and practice. Almost two hundred years
later, it is imperative that we return to interpretation, to reinterpret
the world before trying to change it. ]{.underline}

Certainly, the relationship between thought and revolutionary action has
long been a concern of Marxist thought -- as, for example in the
post-Althusserian work of Étienne Balibar, Alain Badiou or Jacques
Rancière. But the idealism of DS is, to borrow a phrase from Rancière,
'a philosophy of order', a reactionary theoretical discourse which
affirms the academic hierarchy of intellects and positions while
perpetuating the institution's functioning. The political economy of
knowledge in which DS operates is a far cry from the premise of equal
capacity for thought which animates the post-Althusserian conception of
emancipatory politics as a mass politics. [How exactly DS is supposed to
help us fight state violence, racial oppression, labour exploitation,
military occupation, or imperialism more broadly, remains a
mystery.]{.underline}

There have, of course, been attempts to integrate such considerations
into a DS framework. The decolonial critique that comes out of this
engagement is perhaps best exemplified by Cusicanqui's own research
perspective, which she has described as defying the capitalist global
economy while simultaneously offering a way out of the trappings of
Andean patriarchy. As such, it is a mode of critique that is, as
Macarena Gomez-Barris puts it in The Extractive Zone, 'both rooted
within and disindentified from coloniality and Andean "tradition"'. Such
approaches recognise that indigenous and African-descended peoples in
the Americas are not static representations of an idealised past, as
Mignolo seems to suggest: rather, they are contemporary and active
participants in the remaking of modernity. [The answers to coloniality
aren't to be found in a static form of Otherness or indigeneity. And
even less so when the conception of the Other offered is one which
mimics the essentialist prejudices that DS scholars are, so they claim,
trying to unsettle.]{.underline}

In the preceding sections, I have examined [Mignolo's]{.underline}
framework for decoloniality, particularly his emphasis on epistemic
decolonisation, and discussed critiques that focus on its political and
material implications. This section goes further into the troubling
potential of his [notion of delinking from the West --]{.underline} a
concept which, while intended to challenge Eurocentric frameworks, also
[appeals to certain forms of **right-wing nationalism** that manipulate
its principles for exclusionary agendas]{.underline}. [The appeal lies
in Mignolo's conceptualisation of delinking as a severance from Western
modes of thought, which right-wing nationalist movements interpret as
legitimising their own calls for a 'return' to selectively idealised,
often ethno-nationalist, traditions.]{.underline}

This selective adoption of decolonial concepts underscores an important
critique: [when severance from the West is framed as an absolute goal,
it risks reinforcing exclusivist ideologies that reject global
solidarity and ignore historical interdependencies]{.underline} (Hull
2021). By situating knowledge production outside of an interconnected
historical context[, Mignolo's framework can unintentionally reinforce
nationalist appropriations that reject valuable cross-cultural
influences in favour of insular ideologies.]{.underline} [This
highlights the need for more **nuanced** approaches on
decolonisation]{.underline} in education that address epistemic critique
alongside careful consideration of diverse political landscapes and the
ethical imperatives they raise. My analysis begins with Hull's (2021,
2022) critique of decolonial theory, particularly his examination of
what he terms 'epistemic ethno-nationalism', which he associates with
Mignolo and other decolonial thinkers. Hull's argument focuses on [the
metaphysical interpretation of colonial difference]{.underline} that
[underpins this form of nationalism within decolonial
thought.]{.underline} By revisiting this critique, I aim to explore the
political implications of this perspective for understanding
decoloniality. According to Hull,

[Epistemic ethnonationalism denies that there are universal epistemic
standards by which the truth, coherence or well-foundedness of beliefs
can be assessed]{.underline} . . . \[E\]pistemic ethnonationalism
associates with each 'ethnos' or 'ethnie' a set of beliefs, concepts or
theoretical frames proper to it, such that a member of E1 who embraces
concepts, theories or methods proper to E2, E3 or E4 ipso facto reveals
themselves to be at best confused or brainwashed, at worst a
collaborator or fifth-columnist[. Epistemic
ethnonationalism]{.underline} therefore [denies that achieving advances
in knowledge and in ethical and political values can be a shared global
endeavour.]{.underline} Instead, it insists that each ethnos/-ie must
develop its own truth or knowledge, its own values. (Hull 2022, 135,
original emphasis)

In his analysis, Hull raises important concerns regarding the
intersection of far-right critiques of the 'oppressive' West, as
exemplified by the neo-Traditionalism emerging in Russia, and the
[epistemic decolonisation]{.underline} critique of Western hegemony that
[is grounded in epistemic ethnonationalism.]{.underline} According to
Hull (2022), there are notable similarities between these theoretical
frameworks that pose significant challenges for anticolonial struggles.
By identifying these convergences, Hull highlights the potential risks
of [aligning decoloniality too closely with ethnonationalist and
authoritarian discours]{.underline}es that [may]{.underline} ultimately
[undermine]{.underline} the [broader goals of liberation and
justice.]{.underline} Hull's critique serves as a crucial reminder of
the complexities and nuances inherent in contemporary decolonial
discourse, urging scholars to critically examine the implications of
their theoretical positions.

For example, let us return to Mignolo, who writes the following about
race and gender:

Race and gender are two concepts of Western modernity that make us
believe they 'represent' something that exists. Behind race there is an
implied logic of classification (the logic of coloniality) assuming that
people belong to different races and the markers are blood and skin
colour. Behind gender there is an implied logic of classification
assuming that there are women and men. The classifications shape and
guide our perception of society. However, decolonial gnoseological
assumptions say that names and classifications do not refer to what
there is but frame what we perceive (Mignolo 2021, 85).

As Hull (2022) explains[, Mignolo]{.underline}'s argument extends beyond
a straightforward rejection of traditional categories of race and
gender. He [asserts that all concepts ultimately fail to genuinely
reflect the commonalities and differences present in the real
world.]{.underline} Unlike critiques based solely on biological
evidence, [Mignolo's approach is metaphysical, arguing that concepts are
incapable of accurately referencing objective realit]{.underline}y (Hull
2022). He contends that beliefs can only be deemed valid within specific
cultural or geographical contexts -- essentially, they are valid for
'Westerners' or others within particular group identities (Mignolo 2011;
Mignolo and Walsh 2018). By condemning the 'universalising' tendencies
of Western thought, [Mignolo firmly rejects any notion of convergence
with 'Western' epistemologies]{.underline}, advocating instead for a
focus on localism (Hull 2022).

In particular, [Hull]{.underline} (2022) [suggests]{.underline} that
[neo-Traditionalism]{.underline} (e.g. Dugin's Eurasianism in Russia)
[and decolonial theory]{.underline}, though originating from different
convictions -- one aiming to revive a timeless Tradition and the other
to expose and halt exploitation and oppression -- [arrive at similar
positions.]{.underline} Both frameworks assert that each cultural group
has its own unique values and knowledge systems that are valid only
within that group; this assertion appears respectful of cultural
diversity but risks enforcing conformity to predetermined cultural
values on individuals within those groups, regardless of their personal
beliefs. Hull further argues that [both neo-Traditionalism and
decoloniality reject the idea of objective, universal truth, holding
instead that truth is only valid relative to specific cultural or
evaluative frameworks.]{.underline} Both neo-Traditionalism and
decoloniality criticise 'the West' for centuries of economic
exploitation and the imposition of Western beliefs, values, and rational
standards onto non-Western societies. [Both argue that the dominance of
Western knowledge systems has convinced some non-Western groups to view
these frameworks as universally valid]{.underline}, thus the proper
response is 'epistemic disobedience' to challenge this enduring
coloniality (Hull 2022).

#### Epistemological Decolonization is a dead end. It repeats Mignolo's mistakes, ignores real struggles like land return and sovereignty, and misrepresents political aims of anti-colonial movements.

In summary[, Mignolo's prioritisation of epistemic decolonisation calls
for a structural transformation of how knowledge is recognised and
valued. By advocating for delinking and promoting pluriversality, he
challenges the Eurocentric dominance of knowledge systems and suggests
that true decoloniality must prioritise diverse epistemic frameworks
rather than political or material aims. Mignolo's]{.underline}
decolonial [framework draws a]{.underline} stark [epistemic]{.underline}
and [cultural divide between the West and the non-West]{.underline},
[establishing]{.underline} a binary that presumes [a fundamental
incompatibility between Western and non-Western frameworks of knowledge
and politics]{.underline} (Harruch 2024; Temin 2024). [By framing
decolonial theory as a necessary break or delinking from the dominance
of Western epistemology]{.underline}, Mignolo suggests that societies in
the Global South require unique theoretical approaches that
authentically reflect their histories, cultures, and experiences of
colonialism. This perspective implies that theories originating in the
West inherently fail to serve emancipatory aims in non-Western contexts,
thus privileging localised, alternative frameworks as essential for
decolonial work.

Critiques of Mignolo's decolonial framework

In this section, I aim to analyse critiques of Mignolo's decolonial
framework by identifying three primary pitfalls. [First, Mignolo's
essentialist conception of modernity and the West oversimplifies Western
epistemologies while romanticising non-Western
perspectives.]{.underline} Critics argue that this binary approach risks
caricaturing the West as a homogenous entity responsible for all
colonial structures, while idealising the Global South as the primary
site of resistance and 'authentic' knowledge production, an approach
that can reinforce stereotypes and ignore diversity within each region[.
Second, Mignolo's emphasis on epistemological decolonisation -- which
prioritises the delinking of knowledge systems from 'the West' -- often
overlooks the material and political dimensions of anticolonial
struggles, which traditionally focus on tangible outcomes such as land
reclamation, political representation, and economic justice. This
emphasis on epistemology]{.underline} at times [misidentifies
or]{.underline} even [sidelines the core objectives of anticolonial
thought and politics, which frequently emphasise political liberation
alongside cognitive liberation. Finally, Mignolo's framework has been
critiqued for failing to sufficiently historicise colonial practices and
to account for the specific needs and goals of Indigenous scholars, who
often call for a recognition of their political (e.g. sovereignty) and
material]{.underline} (e.g. land return) [aims over purely epistemic
concerns.]{.underline} Critics suggest that decolonisation should be
grounded in both the historical realities of colonialism and the lived
experiences of Indigenous and marginalised communities, which cannot be
fully addressed by focusing on knowledge production alone. Each of these
critiques is further discussed below.

One of the central criticisms of [Mignolo's]{.underline} approach to
modernity and the West lies in [his portrayal of Western epistemologies
as a singular, monolithic force]{.underline}, which he considers
inherently complicit in colonial domination[. By consolidating a wide
range of ideological traditions -- e.g. conservatism, Christianity,
liberalism, socialism, and even Enlightenment thought -- into a single
tradition and concept]{.underline} assumed to be Western or modern[,
Mignolo overlooks significant distinctions between these traditions and
their complex internal debates]{.underline} (Harruch 2024). For example,
while elements of liberalism have indeed been used to justify colonial
expansion, others have provided a foundation for civil rights movements
and anti-colonial arguments (Vázquez-Arroyo 2018). Similarly, Marxism
has played a significant role in anti-colonial and liberation struggles,
yet it is also criticised by Mignolo as part of the Western colonial
project (Temin 2024). This unvarying treatment of Western ideologies as
uniformly oppressive 6 M. ZEMBYLAS simplifies the reality of Western
intellectual traditions, ignoring the historical and political tensions
that have, in many cases, fostered resistance against colonial powers
rather than compliance with them.

Moreover, by romanticising non-Western perspectives, Mignolo's framework
risks reinforcing an essentialist view of the Global South, implying
that these societies inherently possess more 'authentic' and liberating
epistemologies (Moosavi 2020; Temin 2024). This framing creates an
idealised dichotomy between the West and non-West, attributing a purity
or innocence to the latter that is historically inaccurate and
politically limiting (Vickers 2020). This binary can obscure the roles
that complex social movements and diverse political ideologies from
within both Western and nonWestern contexts have played in resisting
colonial structures (Harruch 2024). This binary also fails, according to
Harruch, to acknowledge that the Global South has been shaped not only
by resistance to colonialism but also by internal social conflicts and
power dynamics that cannot be explained through a purely anti-Western
lens. Thus, critics argue that [Mignolo's emphasis on the West as the
ultimate locus of coloniality risks perpetuating an uncritical
valorisation of nonWestern epistemologies, rather than fostering a
nuanced understanding of global power dynamics and emancipatory
potential across contexts]{.underline} (Temin 2024).

Another criticism of [Mignolo's]{.underline} framework is that [his
emphasis on epistemological decolonisation often overlooks the material
and political dimensions of anticolonial struggles.]{.underline} As
Temin (2024) writes, 'Mignolo (mis)identifies political decolonisation
exclusively with limited struggles for the political form of national
independence' (5). [In other words, Mignolo critiques anticolonial
struggles for national liberation as having an overly limited conception
of transformation, one focused mainly on the replacement of colonial
rule with native rule by seising control over state
institutions.]{.underline} He suggests that these movements primarily
aim to transfer political power within existing frameworks of state
authority, rather than challenging or dismantling the underlying
structures of coloniality. By framing anticolonialism in this way,
[Mignolo suggests that such struggles often fail to achieve deeper,
epistemic decolonisation,]{.underline} as they continue to rely on
inherited Western notions of statehood, governance, and authority (Temin
2024).

However, as Temin argues, [this perspective is limited, because it fails
to take seriously the complex histories of anticolonialism(s), hence
Mignolo's depiction of 'decolonisation as a narrowly political, entirely
top-down, uncritically Eurocentric,]{.underline} and
modernisation-oriented political telos \[...\] is unpersuasive' (2024,
5). Temin points out further that 'Mignolo's portrayal of the narrow
horizons of anticolonial movements disavows their complexity, conceptual
innovation, and their popular, worldmaking, and critically attuned
dimensions' (2024, 6). [Mignolo's focus on 'the epistemic' diminishes
the contributions of key anticolonial thinkers like Fanon and Césaire,
who view anticolonialism as both an intellectual and political project
that unites diverse practices and experiences of resistance against
colonialism and imperialism worldwide]{.underline} (Zembylas 2024). By
emphasising epistemic decolonisation, Mignolo shifts attention away from
the multifaceted efforts of these thinkers, which involve not only
critique but also concrete, collective action against colonial
structures[. This approach risks sidelining the anticolonial legacies
that have sought to transform oppressive political and social
realities]{.underline} in ways that directly confront imperial power
dynamics across various global contexts.

Finally[, Mignolo's framework has been]{.underline} critiqued [for
insufficiently contextualising colonial practices within their specific
historical timelines and for not adequately addressing the distinct
needs and aims of Indigenous scholars]{.underline} (Temin 2024[). Many
Indigenous scholars]{.underline} (e.g. Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2014;
Tuck and Yang 2012; Wolfe 2006[) emphasise the importance of
acknowledging local cultural and political practices as well as land
rights, which often require tangible political solutions beyond
Mignolo's largely epistemic focus.]{.underline} Critics argue that by
centering the decolonisation of knowledge, [Mignolo's approach risks
overlooking]{.underline} these [concrete priorities that are essential
to Indigenous movements and their visions of self-determination and
sovereignty.]{.underline} In particular, Temin (2024) makes two
important claims regarding Mignolo's approach to colonial power
structures. First, [Temin argues that Mignolo misinterprets forms of
colonial domination that are more accurately understood through
frameworks like settler colonialism and indigeneity, which focus on
ongoing territorial occupation and cultural erasure.]{.underline} Hence,
Temin suggests[, it is misleading to treat these interconnected material
and ideological practices as merely elements or outcomes of the
'coloniality of knowledge'.]{.underline} Second, Mignolo's emphasis on
epistemic decolonisation, rather than a historically situated analysis
of power relations, overlooks how epistemology itself is shaped by
material and ideological power structures (Temin 2024). This lack of
focus on material power relations limits the framework's ability to
fully address the role of colonialism in shaping societal structures and
ideologies. As Temin summarises the political implications of Mignolo's
framework:

**[\[T\]he turn to coloniality as a purely epistemic register of
critique directs significant interpretive attention away from the
crucial fact that settler epistemic and aesthetic disavowal of the
grounds of Indigenous mobilisation and critique are part-and-parcel of
settlers' long-term accumulation of material and intergenerational
wealth through removal and displacement]{.underline}**. (2024, 9)

One potent rubric that draws together these various lines of revision is
**[a shared interest in diagnosing the Eurocentric character of the
field and offering remedies for its overcoming]{.underline}**. This
**[arguably is the most prominent way of articulating what it means to
decolonize political theory. This critical move]{.underline}** is
salutary and compelling, and it **[has initiated probing discussions of
the limitations, blind spots, and exclusions of the purportedly
universal theories, categories, and narratives of Western political
thought. It has motivated calls for more inclusion and recognition of
non-European thought, and generated important political and
philosophical debates about how to chart and address the ongoing
legacies of empire and racial domination today]{.underline}**. **[At the
same time, we worry that the overriding concern with Eurocentrism is
indicative of a problem, a persistent limit of these approaches, namely
that they tend to focus on Western political thought as the sole object
of critique and analysis.]{.underline}**

Such a strategy of internal critique is perhaps understandable in
scholarship on empire and political theory, which has focused on
recontextualizing canonical debates and thinkers by elucidating the
imperial context of the formation and foundation of modern political
thought. But the dominance of this framing is also apparent in studies
of non-Western thinkers. **[When anticolonial and postcolonial thinkers
are incorporated and engaged with, their political and theoretical
insights are very often reduced to the critique of European political
thought and practices. In the process we lose track of what arguably was
the primary context and aspiration of anticolonial argument: an attempt
to reconstruct viable political futures in the aftermath of European
domination. Likewise, even as postcolonial theory's critique of European
thought has come to be more generously cited, the alternative concepts
it proposes for the study of postcolonial politics are rarely taken
up.]{.underline}**

**[While the critique of Eurocentrism is noteworthy and important, it
should not exhaust what it means to decolonize political theory. Our
hope is to advance and pluralize the project of decolonizing political
theory by suggesting ways of generating political theory from and for
the non-European world, that is, by imagining political theory of a
truly global reach. To do so, we begin by returning to some key themes
of anticolonial thought to remind us of some of its theoretical projects
and purposes]{.underline}**. Our contention is that **[there is much to
learn from its methods and arguments to aid the project of decolonizing
theory and, in turn, to offer a path toward the rejuvenation of
political theory writ large. We also hope to correct the onesided
reception of anticolonialism as simply a critique of the
West]{.underline}**. **[Indeed it might be useful to think of
anticolonial thought as having two connected aims---one critical and
another reconstructive]{.underline}**. To highlight these aims across
differing political projects, we read together two classic, if often
opposed, figures, Gandhi and Fanon. **[Much of the critical work of
anticolonialism was]{.underline}**, indeed, **[imbricated in revealing
the false, compromised, or corrupted universalisms of Western
civilization and the hypocrisy of its self-understanding as the beacon
of enlightened humanism.]{.underline}** The record of colonial violence,
exploitation, and domination revealed the limits and fragilities of the
West's commitment to freedom and, especially, its capacity to be the
agent of its universal realizability. **[But it is worth remembering
that this critical project, exposing the complicity of Western
universalism with violence, was not just an argument with and for the
West.]{.underline}** As is the case with Gandhi and Fanon, very often it
was an argument with and for their colonized compatriots; it was a mode
of self-critique meant to diagnose and break the collective enthrallment
with the West.

**[As the field of political theory begins to engage more routinely with
anticolonial thought,]{.underline}** **[we should remember the
importance of the specific context or problemspace of anticolonial
argument, a context that shapes and clarifies the nature and purpose of
its theoretical interventions.6 The attunement to context is all too
rare; more often, the critical insights of anticolonialism are
registered as abstract and isolated conclusions.]{.underline}** But the
structure, location, and audience of critique matters. **[For instance,
the anticolonial critique of Eurocentrism concerned decolonizing the
mind; its aim was to undo the ingrained moral psychology and habituated
practices of colonialism through which the colonized reproduced their
own subordination]{.underline}**. Moreover, this critical gesture was
meant to clear the ground and make possible a reconstructive argument.
This was to make possible an alternative universal, whether that
normative ideal was characterized as a truer humanism, a more liberatory
politics, or forms of freedom that did not require the domination of
others. **[What is also distinctively anticolonial in this form of
utopian politics was its situated method]{.underline}**. Anticolonial
thinkers tried to pinpoint the cultural and institutional
sites---immanent to the experience of the colonized---that could
generate new emancipatory futures. Crucially, this was simultaneously an
analytic and normative endeavor.

After delineating what we take to be the distinctive features of
anticolonialism as a genre of political theory, we contrast this to the
ways in which these insights have been taken up in contemporary
political theory. Here we focus on some of the prominent ways critical
theory has tried to address the philosophical challenges of
Eurocentrism. We explore the seminal contributions of Susan BuckMorss,
Amy Allen, and James Tully in this regard, and consider how they reckon
with the problem of empire as they offer new models of universality. We
argue that **[these attempts, while salutary, remain either too abstract
or too self-referential; they often try to correct the problem within
the terms of Western political thought itself. Decolonizing becomes a
form of intellectual self-critique and self-cleansing, which seems to
proceed at some distance from concrete sites of political praxis,
especially sites beyond the West.]{.underline}**

Cruel optimism is when the promise of the future can never materialize
(can never bring the good life it promises) *because* it rests on
attachments to the very conditions it seeks to transcend (CO, 227).
[While **decolonization is presumably a complete break from the present
conditions, decolonization-as-violent-replacement** can be seen as
**incapable** of **transcending the logic** of the present:]{.underline}
this is true both for the necessity of violence (which abides by the
conditions of violence imposed by colonization) and in terms of the
political horizon it offers: [If **colonization builds a bifurcated
world**, **decolonization**---in Fanon\'s version---**offers us a future
that reproduces this structure even if it reverts its
content.**]{.underline} The tools---but also the content of the horizon,
of the vision, of the promise---remain the master's (if we are to
momentarily switch from Berlant to Audre Lorde).

The previous can be seen as drawing on Berlant as a *critique* of Fanon
rather than a way of reading him. Furthermore, it can be seen as
reflecting a perspective completely opposite to his, "a settler
perspective," which, for Wolfe, is the only perspective that rejects
binarism (2013, 257). But another reading is possible in this case as
well.

If one accepts my reading of Fanon in section 1, one can further read
Fanon as suggesting that what renders [de**colonization a form of what
we may call "cruel optimism"** is precisely **the adherence to the
elements that in "On Violence" seemed to be at the heart of
decolonization**]{.underline}---[**not just a celebration of violence**,
as I proposed in section 1, but also **the rigid binarism it both
addresses and reproduces**.]{.underline} While "On Violence" opens with
the claim that "decolonization is quite simply the substitution of one
'species' of mankind by another" (WE, 1) and "not in the service of a
higher unity" (WE, 4)---that is, while the chapter begins with a
complete rejection of any form of reconciliation, unity, or sharing the
space of the colony, it ends with a very different tone.

[By the last page of "On Violence" Fanon claims that the "colossal task"
of decolonization is to reintroduce "man into the world, man in his
totality," and **that this task, to which Edward Said referred as the
reintroduction of "real humanism**"]{.underline} (1994, 269), "will be
achieved with the crucial help of the European masses" (WE, 62). [This
possibility, if not a necessity, of a joint struggle for liberation, as
well as the risks of following a Manichaean logic, are examined more
systematically]{.underline} in chapter 2 of *Wretched*. There,
**[nationalism, whilst seen as a necessary step on the way to
liberation, is criticized for *reproducing* the logic of binarism, which
ultimately reproduces
oppression.[^23^](https://journals.sagepub.com/reader/content/197cb3a0f16/10.1177/00905917251341906/format/epub/EPUB/xhtml/index.xhtml?hmac=1752525688-cK%2B3j6dVDtjaTIb2BRbOIrHwbfG5G9Hp%2FfoVLCuiTb4%3D#fn23-00905917251341906)]{.underline}**

Several clarifications are due before we begin. **[To read
decolonization as cruel optimism by no means endorses the status quo of
colonization. It is not a "sit and wait" kind of
critique.]{.underline}** **[Thinking with Berlant is always thinking
critically about our present. Berlant was probably one of the most
astute critics of the present conditions, of the getting-used-to these
conditions, of the deferred future that prevents real change. But they
were also critical of political promises that are bound to fail us. My
aim here is therefore not to point to the inevitability of the colonial
situation but to try and think beyond its impasses---impasses
that]{.underline}**, I will argue, **[the Fanonian version of
decolonization-as-violent-replacement shares rather than
overcomes.]{.underline}**

A similar clarification should be made regarding the status of
**[Fanon's notion of decolonization as a fantasy]{.underline}**, which
will be integral to my reading of it as **[a form of cruel optimism. If
"fantasy is the means by which people hoard idealizing theories and
tableaux about how they and the world 'add up to
something]{.underline}**'" (CO, 2), **[then the frames through which
meaning is given to peoples' relations to each other and the world are
often far from being rational or calculated. To call something "a
fantasy"]{.underline}** is therefore not to dismiss it as irrelevant to
politics. It **[is to ask differently about its political
doings]{.underline}**. Moreover, Berlant saw such fantasies as necessary
given a reality (a world) that has become unbearable. Fantasies are
often the means through which we can continue being in the world despite
and amidst the continuous betrayals of the world in its promises.
Fantasy is thus the defense that makes life possible. But this means
that how we see the world and give it meaning, as well as how we
construct our relations to others and how we inhabit these relations,
reside somewhere between the real and the imagined. This space, for
Berlant, is an important political space; it is often a collective space
and not a psychic or individual one. Nevertheless, this understanding
also calls us to ask what happens if the imaginary turns into a reality
or what happens when the imaginary makes some realities impossible. For
Berlant, **[there seem to be two possibilities: either the realization
of these fantasies "is discovered . . . to be impossible, sheer fantasy,
or \[else it is discovered to be\] too possible, and
toxic]{.underline}**" (CO, 24). In other words, **[whilst necessary and
often enabling, there is something about these fantasies' meeting-point
with reality that renders them potentially destructive.]{.underline}**

#### There is no alternative, violent [decolonization]{.underline} is cruel optimism: it binds the political struggle to [dead-ends]{.underline} even as it liberates and continues to push [settler and native binarie]{.underline}s that stick with us. Even if violence is key, the alternative produces a new world that's [completely broken]{.underline}, where conditions of life are [compromised]{.underline}.

[There are two facets to the necessity of armed violence in
Fanon]{.underline}. The first is a factual calculous of gains and
losses. "[Colonialism only loses its hold when the knife is at its
throat]{.underline}," Fanon stated (WE, 23), probably accurately so.
[Colonization]{.underline}---historically one of the most profitable
enterprises of the West---[must become pricy for it to end,]{.underline}
and Fanon offered a good account of this calculous to which I shall
return. But there is [another element that renders decolonization
violent]{.underline} not as a historical fact but by definition:
Decolonization is, [according to Fanon, "quite simply the substitution
of one 'species' of mankind by another]{.underline}." It is an act of
replacement that is "unconditional, absolute, total, and seamless" (WE,
1), [a complete removal in which the colonized demands "not the status
of the colonist, but his place"]{.underline} (WE, 23). As such,
decolonization is a form of violence. In this section, I propose that
for Fanon, **[violence binds the political struggle to dead-ends even as
it liberates]{.underline}**, that according to him, it has significant
phantasmatic elements, [and that what appears at the beginning of
Wretched to be the only possible solution to the colonial situation
**slowly emerges as the destruction of all political
possibilities**.]{.underline} In short, I want to read Fanon as seeing
[this specific mode of decolonization as a form of cruel
optimism.]{.underline} "Violence" develops alongside several moments (in
the Hegelian sense) in Wretched. In the first, [it is explicitly a
fantasy, a dream---"Dreams of possession"; dreams "of sitting at the
colonist's table and sleeping in his bed, preferably with his
wife"]{.underline} (WE, 5) (which [may be dreams of temptation as part
of the fantasy of replacement, or dreams of rape]{.underline}). The last
set of dreams was probably what Arendt had in mind when she wrote: "Who
has ever doubted that \[. . .\] [the oppressed 'dream at least once a
day of setting' themselves up in the oppressor's place]{.underline}. . .
. [\[However,\]]{.underline} the point . . . is [that dreams never come
true." And when they do]{.underline}, Arendt continued, th[ey are
**turned "into nightmares for everybody.**]{.underline} In no case, as
far as I know, was the force of these 'volcanic' outbursts . . . 'equal
to that of the pressure put on them.'" Therefore, she concluded, "[to
identify the national liberation movements with such outbursts is to
prophesy their doom]{.underline}" (Arendt 1970, 20--21). Arendt's
critique here is not a moral critique of the fantasy itself. It makes
sense that, after and against the backdrop of so long and so radical
oppression, the oppressed want to see the oppressor disappear. The
critique is rather [a political critique of the attempt to actualize the
dream]{.underline}. It was a critique Arendt wrote against Fanon, 6 yet
once we move beyond "On Violence" into other chapters of Wretched,
Fanon's claims begin to resemble hers. Violent decolonization
[becomes]{.underline}, in Fanon himself, [either a "sheer fantasy" that
can never be actualized "or too possible, and toxic]{.underline}" (to
return to Berlant). Let us track, then, [the trajectory from fantasy to
realization.]{.underline} The most embodied, most detailed descriptions
of violence in "On Violence" [seem to be allocated to the phantasmatic
world:]{.underline} It is [in the dreams]{.underline}, the dances,
[which are "muscular org\[ies\]]{.underline} during which the most
brutal aggressiveness [and impulsive violence are
channeled]{.underline}, transformed, and spirited away" (WE, 19),
[wherein "symbolic killings,]{.underline} figurative cavalcades, [and
imagined multiple murders, everything has to come out]{.underline}" (WE,
20). It is in the ceremonies, the myths, the poems, wherein violence
appears most viscerally and murder is depicted in the most concrete
details. It is an image Fanon tells us, with clear, yet phantasmatic
presence [in the "imagination of every colonized subject]{.underline}"
(WE, 6), in "[dreams of aggressive vitalit]{.underline}y" (WE, 15).
[Some of these fantasies are clearly fantasies of
decolonization]{.underline}, fantasies [in which the colonized can
"**blow the colonial world to smithereen**]{.underline}" (WE, 6). Others
are fantasies that serve to deflect or transfer both the form of
oppression and the object of resistance (from colonization to something
else): "vampirism, possession by djinns, by zombies, and by Legba, the
illustrious god of voodoo." [These fantasies play "a key regulating role
in ensuring the stability of the colonized world]{.underline}": Since
"the mythical structures contain far more terrifying adversaries," "the
problem now is not whether to fall in line with the armor-plated world
of colonialism, but to think twice before urinating, spitting, or going
out in the dark." In other words, "[it is evident that everything is
reduced to a permanent confrontation at the level of
phantasy]{.underline}" (WE, 20, 19). [These forms of phantasmatic
transference of violence]{.underline} thus **[hinder political
organization,]{.underline}** much [like the aggression of one colonized
toward the other]{.underline}--- that Fanon also identifies as central
to the pre-decolonization stage. Moreover, [many of them provide an
outlet for violence]{.underline} that, as such, [delays its articulation
as political resistance]{.underline}. [On their way to the dancing
scene]{.underline}, for example, "these [men and women were stamping
impatiently]{.underline}, their nerves 'on edge.' [On the way back, the
village returns to serenity]{.underline}, peace, and stillness"(WE, 20),
[since, as we saw, in the dance "the most brutal aggressiveness and
impulsive violence are channelled]{.underline}, transformed, and
spirited away" (WE, 19). We can therefore read **[some of these
fantasies as external to, and even contradictory to, the development of
decolonization]{.underline}**. Yet such are precisely the fantasies of
"the good life" under capitalism of which Berlant writes: **[they bind
us to an image of the world, and of ourselves in the world, that
reproduces the impasses we inhabit rather than allowing us to overcome
them]{.underline}**. [Some fantasies serve as a defense]{.underline}
(CO, 49) [by enabling avoidance]{.underline} (much like those zombie
fantasies); [others by projecting the logic of the present into the
future]{.underline} (like replacement fantasies, a point to which I
return in the next section). [Both are part of the logic of cruel
optimism]{.underline}. Either way, for now, violence remains if not
completely phantasmatic, at the very least sublimated, specifically in
muscular tension, at times spasms (WE, 19), with ideas and concepts that
are being destroyed (WE, 11) and [knives that can be "close to hand" but
not used]{.underline} (WE, 8). [There is blood, but it is "in the
air"]{.underline} (WE, 29); there is an atmosphere of violence. In its
next moment, [this fantasy is realized, and violence becomes
actualized]{.underline}. "After years of unreality, after wallowing in
the most extraordinary phantasms, [the colonized subject, machine gun at
the ready, finally confronts the only force which challenges his very
being: colonialism]{.underline}" (WE, 20). At this point, "the colonized
subject discovers reality and transforms it through his praxis, his
deployment of violence and his agenda for liberation" (ibid.). [The
violence that previously remained abstract, symbolic, or actualized only
in transference can now "change directions]{.underline}" (WE, 21): from
attacking/fearing zombies or releasing aggression in dance, [to
political resistance and thus, also, from fantasy to
actualization]{.underline}. This actualization, Fanon emphasizes, is
essential to the formation of both subject and nation. "The armed
struggle" is formative both to the individual and the nation; in fact,
it is formative to the individual (also) "since each individual
represents a violent link in the great chain, in the almighty body of
violence rearing up in reaction to the primary violence of the
colonizer" (WE, 50); it "mobilizes the people, i.e., it pitches them in
a single direction" (ibid)---which is how, we may argue, sovereignty
emerges.7 (We will later see that for Berlant, [such frictionless
togetherness is never an option]{.underline}, but let us stay with the
actualization of violence for now). This actualization [also **generates
a spiral of violence where more violence on one side brings more
violence on the other**]{.underline}. From the colonized side we find
knives, shotguns, and people fighting with their bare hands (WE, 26,
38), engaging in acts "that have been decreed heinous by the
metropolitan press and public opinion" (24--25), working "towards the
death of the colonist" (44). [The violence of colonization is more
brutal]{.underline}, and importantly, it has been there from the
beginning in its most realistic, physical form: with rifles, tanks,
naval vessels, planes, napalm, and bombs (4, 25, 47), [with famine that
is used as a weapon, including **starving the colonized population** to
death]{.underline} (9, 15), **[sexual violence]{.underline}** (15, 50),
**[beating the colonized "day in and day out]{.underline}**" (17),
**[electrifying his genitals]{.underline}**, and using other forms of
torture (22, 50). In the final moment, by the end of Wretched, [the
devastating outcomes of the realization of the fantasy become
clear]{.underline}. In the last chapter, [violence stays concrete and
specific; it is the violence of the raping of a wife while her husband
joins the guerrilla struggle, of a massacre of twenty Algerian men from
which one survived after being shot in the limb and fainting, of
torture. It is]{.underline} not the phantasmatic orgy of violence from
the first moment, nor the actual, but often [the less-specific violent
struggle of the second moment]{.underline}. It is what happened to or
was acted by Fanon's patients during this struggle. At that moment, when
Fanon looks at the level of the human, [when more humanity is therefore
inserted into the picture, **violence is no longer celebrated. It cannot
be celebrated when it is felt so close, so directly**]{.underline}. At
that moment, it is also no longer altogether clear what its ethical,
political, or psychological value is. [It is certainly not something to
find "exhilarating]{.underline}" (Dean 2024[) but a tragedy]{.underline}
(Gordon 1995, 70ff) [from **which we will never fully heal**, even if it
may have been necessary to overcome the colonial
oppression]{.underline}.8 If in the first chapter, [Fanon can be read as
celebrating violence as the way through which the colonized creates
himself as a man and a nation comes into being]{.underline},[9 then in
the last chapter, we find that **if violence produced a new world, a new
nation, and a new subject as "On Violence" argues, those are completely
broken ones**]{.underline}. "Too possible, and toxic," to return once
more to Berlant; a (re-)creation of a world in which thriving remains
impossible. [The violence of decolonization is]{.underline}, therefore,
simultaneously a necessity and [something that leads to a complete
shattering of both subject and world]{.underline}. Rather than
delivering its promises of a better future, [it ends up reproducing the
compromised conditions of the present or, at best, **leading to another
present in which the conditions of life are as
compromised**]{.underline}. It is, in this sense, a form of cruel
optimism. \*\*\* It may be [that this is an inevitable
tragedy]{.underline}: from the moment the colonial relations have been
established and entrenched, [there is no way to release their grip but
through violence, and once the violence of resistance begins, it is
bound to be met with violence from the colonial forces and thus
escalate. Eventually, it therefore destroys the very world and subject
it also builds. And **yet it has no alternative: any failure to resist
will mean the continuation of the violence of
colonization**,]{.underline} which, in some respects at least, is
worse.10 It may be that---as many indeed argued in regard to Berlant's
cruel optimism (e.g., Wilder 2017)---all we are left with are impasses.
