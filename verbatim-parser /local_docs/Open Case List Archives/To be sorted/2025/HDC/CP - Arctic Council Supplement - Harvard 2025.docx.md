2\. [**Rejoin** the **Arctic Council**, or ensure **continued support**
for its most **pressing initiatives**]{.underline}. [The Arctic Council
has proven to be the foremost player in international climate policy in
the region, and it was **specifically designed** to function in spite of
the **security** **differences** of its member states]{.underline}. The
United States and its allies have far more to lose by boycotting the
organization than they stand to gain. **[Washington]{.underline}**
[should resume participation]{.underline} [in the **Arctic Council** as
**soon** as **possible**]{.underline}; if this is infeasible during
Russia's chairmanship of the council, the United States should continue
its support for the organization's six expert working groups, or seek to
duplicate their activities with regional partners or through other
forums. Norway will take over as chair of the council in 2023.

[The Arctic Council was]{.underline} responsible for several activities
of key import to US Arctic interests. First, the organization was [a
**principal organizer** of **scientific collaboration** that
included]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**, [most of which has
**ground to a halt.**]{.underline} [Second, the Arctic Council created a
working group to study radiological sites in the Arctic, create
procedures to recover hazardous materials, and **craft contingency
plans** in case of **nuclear** **contamination**]{.underline}. The
council was set to convene this summer to discuss nuclear waste
disposal, but the meeting has been canceled. [Third,]{.underline} [the
**organization** was largely **responsible** for **monitoring
environmental**]{.underline} [**conditions** and **pollution** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and experts fear that without adequate oversight,
Russia will be free to conduct harmful activities such as gas-flaring.

Analysts have proposed that the Arctic Council member states other than
Russia duplicate the most important organizational projects among
themselves, without Russian involvement. In fact, the United States has
successfully engaged allies to pursue environmental goals outside of the
forum in the past. Moreover, other organizations, such as the
International Arctic Science Committee, have continued their operations
without Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and could provide an
alternative for regional engagement.

However, although this approach would yield more progress than
suspending Arctic cooperation entirely, Russian involvement in Arctic
climate collaboration is critical. The nation owns more than half of the
Arctic coastline, contains the vast majority of the area's radiological
contamination, and samples and data from Russia are indispensable for
climate change research. Therefore, the United States should seek to
resume its participation in the Arctic Council in 2023 at the latest;
Washington should also address the environmental concerns that are
normally managed by the council's working groups with other Arctic
states until that point. US policymakers could also work through the
Northern Forum, a Russia-based international organization that
coordinates efforts among subnational Arctic governments; however, there
is no full substitute for national-level collaboration on larger
environmental priorities.

[In the **future**, the United States cannot **allow** its
**relationship** with the **Arctic Council** to become a **victim** of
**security competition**]{.underline}. [One of the principal strengths
of the Arctic Council is its **explicit commitment** to avoid **security
issues**]{.underline}. Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo upended this
norm by raising security concerns in the forum in 2019, and the United
States and its Western partners boycotted the organization in response
to another security situation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [If the
**United** States continues to link its **security concerns** with its
**Arctic Council activities**, the **organization's ability** to
**safeguard** the Arctic **environment** could be **critically
eroded.**]{.underline}

Conclusion

With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military supremacy
driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed geopolitical
region. [Global powers like **China**, the **U.S.,** and **Russia** are
**vying** for **control of the region** because of the melting
ice]{.underline}, [which has made it more **accessible** for **economic
exploitation**. Territorial claims overlap when states **bolster** their
**military presence**, raising the possibility of **error or
conflict**]{.underline}. [The Arctic runs the risk of **turning** into a
**hot spot** for **future hostilities** in the **absence** of **defined
methods** to handle these tensions.]{.underline}

[There is an urgent need for more **international collaboration** to
stop this **escalation**. Although the UNCLOS]{.underline} [and the
**Arctic Council** have **facilitated communication**]{.underline}, they
are ill-equipped to handle the region's growing security concerns.
[Redoubled efforts should]{.underline} concentrate on broadening
diplomatic channels to cover security and military matters, [setting up
a platform for Arctic countries to discuss weapons control and
**developing guidelines** for **military behavior**]{.underline}. [The
moment has come for Arctic]{.underline} [countries to engage in
**formalized diplomatic discussion** that covers military and security
matters]{.underline}. [Whether through]{.underline} a distinct treaty or
[the Arctic Council, a new global]{.underline} security framework [might
offer a forum for **controlling** the **military buildup**]{.underline},
negotiating arms control measures, [and defining explicit rules of
engagement to avoid unintentional conflicts.]{.underline} In addition to
lowering the likelihood of violence, this would establish a crisis
management system in the Arctic. [International organizations must also
**mediate conflicts** and make sure that]{.underline} [**competition**
i]{.underline}n the Arctic [doesn't]{.underline}
[jeopardize]{.underline} [indigenous rights or the **sustainability** of
the **environment**.]{.underline} In [the face of mounting global
pressure, the **Arctic** can only continue to be a **region of
harmony**, **collaboration**, and **shared wealth** via **concerted
effort**.]{.underline}

[[Climate change in the Arctic is happening at an unprecedented rate
with the estimated average temperature increase now three times higher
than the global average.]{.mark} [As a result]{.mark}, the Arctic
[inhabitants are among the first to experience the profound impacts of
climate change firsthand. Climate change significantly impacts
Indigenous Peoples and their communities in the Arctic, affecting their
environment, livelihoods, cultural practices, and overall
well-being]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our youth will inherit the state of our
planet. This places a crucial responsibility on all generations past and
present. Arctic climate change affects all spheres of work being
undertaken by the Arctic Council with huge cross-cutting consequences
for Arctic biodiversity, ecosystems and societies. T[he Chairship will
highlight climate change trends and address the impacts of climate
change on sustainable development in the Arctic. Addressing Climate
Change and its impacts: [High priority will be given to the already
undergoing work in monitoring]{.mark} as well as documenting [the
biological and physical climate-related changes in the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[These encompass changes such as thawing
permafrost, melting sea ice, changing biodiversity and ecosystems
together with the many effects on Indigenous Peoples and Arctic
communities]{.mark}, including human health and well-being, culture,
livelihoods, and economy,]{.underline} infrastructure as well as
ecosystem services and food systems. An update report on climate change
in the Arctic will be prepared during the Chairship. Shape action in
other regional and international fora: [[We will support increased
collaboration among and between the Arctic Council and Observer States
to ensure that Arctic circumstances, including the circumstances of
Arctic Indigenous Peoples, are brought to bear in global negotiations to
mitigate and adapt to climate change]{.mark}, most prominently in the
negotiations that take place under the UNFCCC.]{.underline} The
Chairship will also advocate for upholding the rights of Indigenous
Peoples in our engagement with other regional and international fora
throughout our Chairship term. Focus on Black Carbon and Methane: The
Chairship will continue the important work on short-lived climate
pollutants with strong warming and health related effects. The work will
focus on sharing best practices and advocating reductions in emissions
of black carbon (soot) and methane.

[US-Russia talks]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin phone
call [signal a possible negotiation for peace in Ukraine and **new

**Arctic region**.]{.underline}

[The Arctic]{.underline}, warming four times faster than the rest of the

cooperation**]{.underline}. [**US-Russia rapprochement**
may]{.underline} [broadly benefit the world by **bringing an end** to
the **disastrous war** in **Ukraine** and **reducing** the **risk of
nuclear war**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [**existential**
environmental **issues** still **demand attention**.]{.underline}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, **[Kirill
Dmitriev]{.underline}**, [CEO of the **Russian Direct Investment
Fund**]{.underline}, [named the region as a potential setting for
US-Russia cooperation]{.underline}: "[We need to pursue **joint
projects**]{.underline}, [including, for example, in the]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline}." [The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for
cooperation as the two sides have explicitly expressed interest in
exploring cooperation in energy, investment, and geopolitical issues.
Western sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation
in the Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for
Arctic shipping. US officials now see Arctic cooperation as a potential
means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline}

In my meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is
clear that many [are **interested** in **diverse forms** of **Arctic**
**cooperation**,]{.underline} from cultural diplomacy that celebrates
the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering
Strait, [to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate
hazards faced by both nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however,
are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the]{.underline} [countries' diplomatic missions]{.underline} [will
significantly **reduce** the **current obstacles** to US-**Russia
scientific cooperation** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. By making it
easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries, [Americans
and Russians]{.underline} [will]{.underline} again [be able
to]{.underline} [conduct joint research]{.underline}, expeditions, [and
scientific conferences]{.underline} and build models to better
understand the unfolding climate emergency. [Scientific
cooperation]{.underline} to understand the changes affecting sea ice,
permafrost, ecosystems, and local communities [has been blunted by the
**political fallout** of the **war** in **Ukraine**.]{.underline}

**[Cooperation]{.underline}** [in the Arctic can help **build regional
stability**]{.underline}. More importantly, **[Arctic]{.underline}**
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [will **build trust** between the
**US**]{.underline} [and **Russia** that could]{.underline}
[**complement** or **spill over** into other **crucial fields** of
**cooperation** such as **arms** **control**, **Middle East peace**, and
**global health**.]{.underline}

[[The Arctic Council was established to promote sustainable development
and environmental protection in the Arctic Region. It has provided
effective cooperation between the eight Arctic States with many tangible
results]{.underline}. The Council is not founded on a treaty or legally
based commitments. It was established as a high-level intergovernmental
forum by a declaration signed by the Foreign Ministers of the Arctic
States. Why has [the Arctic Council been so effective in promoting
measures at different levels in addressing environmental protection and
sustainable development in the Arctic? Decision making informed by
science, indigenous knowledge, and the inherent structure for dialogue
between scientists and policy makers has been the
key.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[S]{.underline}tructure and method of work]{.mark}**

[The Arctic Council cooperation is based upon a consensus-building
approach. Decisions cannot be taken by the Council unless there is
consensus among all [the Arctic States. This might be seen as a
weakness. However, given the structure of the Arctic Council, this has
indeed turned out to be a major strength.]{.underline} The Arctic
Council works at three levels. These are the Ministerial level, the
Senior Arctic Officials level, and the working group level. At all these
levels the consensus principle prevails. Every two years the Council
meets at the Ministerial level. These meetings are usually attended by
Foreign Ministers of the Arctic States. Each Ministerial meeting marks
the end of one Chairmanship and the beginning of another. The Ministers
receive reports and recommendations from the Council ́s subsidiaries.
They decide upon new priorities and follow-up with the Arctic States. A
detailed work plan for the next Chairmanship period is approved and
highlights of the past and ongoing work recorded by the Ministers. At
the second level, Senior Arctic Officials (SAOs) meet at least twice a
year to monitor and guide the Council's work including the scientific
and the fact-finding work. SAOs are generally high-ranking officials,
ambassadors, from the Foreign Ministries. They take their mandate from
the Ministers. The dialogue that takes place between SAOs and the
scientists from the third level is of high significance and central for
consensus building for the informed decision making in the Council. At
the working group level, the council has 6 permanent working groups and
a varying number of expert groups. Sometimes special Task Forces are
established for urgent tasks to be completed between Ministerial
meetings. The working groups are responsible for the scientific and
technical work which is carried out by scientists and indigenous
representatives from the Arctic States.]{.mark}

People living in the Arctic have a natural and particular interest in
activities occurring in the Arctic and how sustainable economic
development is advanced in a balanced manner with respect for different
Arctic ways of life. [[The Chairship will dedicate efforts and attention
towards sustainable economic development, with a goal of ensuring that
initiatives in this field are being led by the Peoples of the Arctic for
the benefit of all Arctic inhabitants with a particular focus on
Indigenous Peoples. Sustainable Economic Development: A dedicated focus
on sustainable economic development aligns with the Arctic Council's
Strategic Plan (2021-2030). The Chairship will undertake an assessment
of the economic development needs within Arctic communities. In order to
promote]{.underline}]{.mark} this priority, efforts will be made and
attention will be given towards sustainable economic development within
the region, with a clear goal of ensuring that initiatives regarding
[[economic development in the Arctic are conducted according to
frameworks determined by the peoples of the Arctic, for the Peoples of
the Arctic, and thus directly benefiting the communities and the Peoples
of the Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Chairship will focus on present
and future economic activities and sustainable economic cooperation with
non-Arctic partners, guided by the aforementioned principles. [The
initiatives will cover a wide range of areas, from the more traditional
Arctic occupations within hunting/harvesting, fishing, forestry,
agriculture and animal husbandry to offshore industry, energy
transition, mining and tourism.]{.underline} The approach will be
economic development seen from, but not limited to, a North-to-North
perspective. The Chairship is planning to organize a workshop/conference
in order to exchange information, facilitate contact, and provide input
for the assessment of the economic development needs and to take this
agenda further in the work of the Arctic Council. Connectivity with a
focus on communication, transport, business and trade: [[Opportunities
for inter-connectedness among people in the Arctic as well as with the
rest of the world are key to a prosperous and sustainable Arctic.
Connectivity between Indigenous Peoples and Arctic communities takes
place through communication and transport and through direct
cooperation, business, and trade]{.underline}.]{.mark} In this vein,
reliable and affordable telecommunication is essential for Arctic
residents in order to access services and participate in the digital
economy. [The Chairship wants to maintain a focus on improving
connectivity, building on previous mappings of needs, gaps and
solutions. Improve knowledge on Blue Bioeconomy: The Chairship will
promote the concept of Blue Bioeconomy as a cornerstone of sustainable
economic development in the Arctic, [focusing on the responsible use and
management of marine resources to secure long-term economic benefits
while preserving the health and biodiversity of marine ecosystems. This
will promote economic growth, job creation, and environmental
sustainability in relation to aquaculture, seaweed farming and
harvesting as well as the responsible utilization of other living marine
resources]{.mark}]{.underline} and will offer numerous opportunities for
sustainable economic development, cooperation in research, and knowledge
exchange. Support Energy Transition Solutions: [F[unding energy
transition solutions in the Arctic is essential for environmental
sustainability and is also crucial for sustainable development in remote
Arctic communities, reducing carbon emissions and polluting activities
while supporting local economies.]{.underline}]{.mark} Additionally, new
technologies related to alternative fuels, including Power2X, are of
importance due to increasing shipping and industrial activities in the
Arctic. The Chairship will continue to promote this agenda.

[What have been [the major achievements by the Arctic Council during its
first 20 years?]{.underline} For many the Arctic Council has been quite
successful in its work. It has indeed been referred to as a major poster
case of diplomatic success. Its fundamental scientific and technical
research has [resulted in]{.underline} a number of actions, taken
eventually by the Ministers, which have aimed at better [environmental
protection and promotion of sustainable development in the Arctic
Region]{.underline}. Some measures have been cases - the Arctic States
have used their conclusions in the Arctic Council to argue for more
effective international agreements in respective international fora with
considerable success. [Monitoring of persistent organic pollutants in
biota and humans in the Arctic produced conclusive evidence that helped
to generate international consensus for the Stockholm
convention]{.underline} in 2001 \[1\]. In the Arctic we have already
seen reduced levels of some of the substances covered by that
convention. Similarly, [the work of the Arctic Council on monitoring of
heavy metals in the Arctic Environment helped to establish the Minamata
Convention]{.underline} in 2013 \[2\]. Lastly, but perhaps most
importantly, [the Arctic Council's Arctic Climate Impact
Assessment,]{.underline} published in 2004 \[3\], [contributed
significantly to the IPCC's understanding of global climate
change.]{.underline} There are more examples. [The Council's Arctic
Marine Shipping Assessment in 2009 informed the development of the Polar
Code]{.underline} by the International Maritime Organization. The Polar
Code, [which now regulates shipping activities in the
Arctic,]{.underline} entered into force on 1 January 2017 \[4\]. Most
recently the Reykjavík Ministerial [adopted a comprehensive action plan
on marine litter with special emphasis on reducing plastic
pollution]{.underline} \[5\]. Of other notable achievements, [the Arctic
States have negotiated three legally binding agreements]{.underline}
under the auspices of the Arctic Council which are of great relevance
for the Arctic. These are the Agreement on Cooperation on [Aeronautical
and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic]{.underline} (\[6\],
[Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and
Response in the Arctic \[7\] and Agreement on Enhancing International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation \[8\].]{.underline} At the most recent
Ministerial Meeting of the Arctic Council in Reykjavik in May 2021 the
Ministers agreed on a Strategic Plan laying out a vision for the Arctic
in 2030 with strategic goals and actions. The Strategic Plan will guide
and strengthen the Arctic Council in the coming years when the work
resumes from the present situation affected by the Russian-Ukrainian
conflict. **Conclusion [The strength of the Arctic Council is in its
structure, and in the fact that the consensus principle between the
eight Arctic States prevails at all levels in this
structure.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

Furthermore, the outcome of Russia's war in Ukraine bears the potential
to influence future security and stability in the Arctic regarding
Russia's future on the Arctic Council. Composed of the eight Arctic
states (the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Russia, Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden), the Council is a consensus-based intergovernmental forum
designed to facilitate cooperation and collaboration on Arctic concerns
and which thereby contributes to stability in the region. As a response
to the onset of Russia's invasion to Ukraine, the seven other members of
the Council (the "Arctic 7") suspended political activities and
high-level meetings. While projects that did not involve Russia resumed
as early as the summer of 2022, this decision has pushed back the
progress of inter-Arctic dialogue and cooperation. [Regardless of
whether Russia should win or lose the war in Ukraine, the Arctic 7 may
seek the eventual **re-normalization of Russia into Council activities
to resume full-scale Arctic coordination and cooperation**]{.underline}.
The Arctic 7 may reluctantly prefer this option over the continued
isolation of the largest Arctic state, which would undermine the
fundamental vision of circumpolar cooperation that prompted the
Council's creation in the first place.

[The Arctic remains an evolving arena for **geopolitical
competition**]{.underline} [between Russia and the U.S. and its Arctic
NATO allies, particularly as tensions have **increased** following
**Russia's invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline}. [To help mitigate risks
and preserve stability in the Arctic]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}
[and the U.S.,]{.underline} [along with the rest of the Arctic 7
countries]{.underline}, [must take care to ensure that increased human
activity and military capabilities in the region **do not lead to

[Strengthen human security. [Climate change is redefining economic and
human security across the Arctic subregions. Notably, local and
indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable to the significant
environmental and ecosystem changes, yet these communities are often
absent from broader regional discussions. Many Arctic indigenous groups
have inhabited the region for thousands of years. Over forty ethnic

[During the Cold War, the Arctic became a kind of an essential question
from a geographical, but also geopolitical perspective. [The development
of the nuclear arsenal was a big game changer. We get nuclear submarines
and nuclear testing in the area from the Soviet Union.]{.underline}
]{.mark}

[JENNIFER SPENCE (JS): Rinna\'s set the stage really nicely. [As the
Cold War was coming to an end, there was a global desire for peace and
cooperation, along with a focus on environmental protection and
sustainable development because of concerns about environmental issues
around potential nuclear disasters, oil spills, and risks attached with
contaminants. So the Arctic Council was set up to address those concerns
and others.]{.underline} [The Arctic Council]{.underline} focused on
sustainable development and what that meant. It [looked at monitoring

climate change-related issues. Emergency management and

and conservation, and then marine protection.]{.underline} So you get a
sense of where [there is a recognized value to cooperation.]{.underline}
]{.mark}

[And in particular, [the founders of the Council made a deliberate
decision to not include military security in the work, in order to allow
for more science diplomacy work to happen. A]{.underline}nother
[important aspect of the Arctic Council is a strong presence by the
Indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who were successful in creating a
place for themselves in the region's governance. This is quite unique

multilateral cooperation, in terms of the norms of what is expected in
it, and the role that people of the Arctic play in

[For nearly **three decades**]{.underline}, [the **Arctic Council** has
been a successful example of]{.underline} post-Cold War
**[cooperation]{.underline}**.

[Its eight members]{.underline}, [including **Russia** and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [have cooperated on
**climate-change** research and **social development**]{.underline}
across the ecologically sensitive region.

Now, a year after council members stopped working with Russia following
its invasion of Ukraine and as Norway prepares to assume the
chairmanship from Moscow on May 11, [experts are asking whether the
polar body\'s **viability is at risk** if it cannot
cooperate]{.underline} with the country that controls over half of the
Arctic coastline.

[An ineffective Arctic Council could have dire implications for
the]{.underline} region\'s **[environment]{.underline}** and its 4
million inhabitants [who face the effects of **melting sea ice**
and]{.underline} the interest of non-Arctic countries in the region\'s
mostly [untapped mineral **resources**]{.underline}.

[The work of the **council**]{.underline}, which comprises the eight
Arctic states of Finland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Russia, Denmark,
Canada and the United States, in the past [has produced **binding
agreements** on **environmental protection** and
preservation]{.underline}.

It is also a rare platform giving a voice to the region\'s Indigenous
peoples. It does not deal with security issues.

[But with the **end of cooperation** with Moscow]{.underline}, about a
third of [the council\'s]{.underline} 130 [projects are **on
hold**]{.underline}, [new projects **cannot go ahead** and existing ones
**cannot be renewed**]{.underline}. Western and Russian [scientists no
longer share **climate change** findings]{.underline}, for example, and
[cooperation for possible **search-and-rescue** missions or **oil
spills** has stopped]{.underline}.

\"I am worried that this will really hobble the ability of the Arctic
Council to work through these various issues,\" U.S. senator Angus King
from Maine told Reuters.

A DIVIDED REGION?

The Arctic is warming about four times as fast as the rest of the world.

As sea ice vanishes, polar waters are opening to shipping and other
industries eager to exploit the region\'s bounty of natural resources,
including oil, gas, and metals such as gold, iron and rare earths.

The discord between Russia and the other Arctic Council members means
that an effective response to these changes is far less likely.

\"Norway has a big challenge,\" said John Holdren, co-director of the
Harvard Kennedy School\'s Arctic Initiative and a former science advisor
to U.S. President Barack Obama. \"That\'s how to rescue as much as
possible of the Arctic Council\'s good work in the absence of Russia.\"

Russia argues this work cannot continue without it.

The council is weakening, Russian Arctic Ambassador Nikolay Korchunov
told Reuters, saying he was not confident it \"will be able to remain
the main platform on Arctic issues\".

Adding to the worries is the possibility that Russia will go its own way
on issues affecting the region or even establish a rival council.

Recently, it has taken steps to expand cooperation in the Arctic with
non-Arctic states. On April 24, Russia and China signed a memorandum
establishing cooperation between the countries\' coast guards in the
Arctic.

Days earlier, on April 14, Russia invited China, India, Brazil and South
Africa - the BRICS - to conduct research at its settlement on Svalbard,
an Arctic archipelago under Norwegian sovereignty where other countries
can operate under a 1920 Treaty.

\"Russia is seeking to build relationships with some non-Arctic
countries, particularly China, and that is a development that is
concerning,\" said David Balton, executive director of the Arctic
Steering Committee at the White House.

Russia\'s Korchunov said Moscow welcomed non-Arctic states in the
region, provided they did not come with a military agenda.

\"Our focus on a purely peaceful format of partnership also reflects the
need of development of scientific and economic cooperation with
non-Arctic countries,\" he said.

HOW TO ENGAGE WITH MOSCOW

Norway says it is \"optimistic\" a seamless transition of the
chairmanship from Russia can be achieved as it is in the interest of all
Arctic states to maintain the Arctic Council.

\"[We need to safeguard the **Arctic Council**]{.underline} as the most
important international forum for Arctic cooperation [and make sure it
survives]{.underline},\" Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Eivind Vad
Petersson told Reuters.

That will not be easy, given Oslo\'s own strained relations with Moscow.
In April, Oslo expelled 15 Russian diplomats saying they were spies.
Moscow denied the accusations and Korchunov said the expulsions
undermined the trust needed for cooperation.

Analysts say NATO-member Norway, which shares an Arctic border with
Russia, is still well-placed to handle the delicate balancing act with
Moscow.

\"Norway has been the most outspoken when it comes to the possibility of
keeping the door ajar so that Russia could, when politically feasible,
be part of the Arctic Council again,\" said Svein Vigeland Rottem, a
senior researcher in Arctic governance and security at the Fridtjof
Nansen Institute in Oslo.

Indeed, said lawmaker Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, [the **council** will
eventually need to **reengage** with Russia]{.underline} even if that
moment has not yet arrived.

\"I don\'t see an Arctic Council without Russia in the future,\" said
Larsen, a Greenland lawmaker at the Danish Parliament and the Chair of
Arctic Parliamentarians, a body including MPs from across the Arctic
countries.

\"We need to be prepared for a different time when the war (in Ukraine)
one day will be over.\"

increasingly interconnected within the global chessboard, other nations
are also looking northward. There are thirteen Arctic Council observer
states, with nations such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore engaging
in Arctic research or formulating Arctic policy. BRICS nations are also

[[The Arctic Economic Council]{.underline}'s latest "Arctic Mining
Report 2024" [argues that the Arctic region holds the key to advancing
the global green transition by providing critical raw materials
(CRMs).]{.underline} The report states that [the Arctic is home to 31
out of the 34 materials identified as essential for technologies like
renewable energy installations and electric vehicle
batteries.]{.underline} [With climate change pressuring industries to
decarbonize, access to these resources has become a vital element in
global energy strategies.]{.underline} The report places focus on the
Arctic's unique potential as a CRM powerhouse, with mining projects
already underway across the region. Greenland has one of the world's
largest deposits of nickel and cobalt, while Alaska hosts one of the
largest zinc mines globally. Northern Sweden is also transitioning its
steel industry to fossil-free production, making it a part of an
emerging battery production cluster. Mads Qvist Frederiksen, [the
Executive Director of the Arctic Economic Council, states]{.underline}
in the report that the [Arctic region's mining industry stands out for
its stable environmental and ethical regulations, with an established
track record of indigenous participation.]{.underline} The Arctic region
has stable and robust environmental and ethical regulations. There is a
history of indigenous participation in the mining industry with local
variations throughout the region," he wrote. "[For centuries, mining has
been the backbone of Arctic communities. Today, the sector operates
responsibly, with some of the highest standards globally and fewer
greenhouse gas emissions.]{.underline}" The report underscores the
strategic importance of developing the Arctic's CRM potential as
countries aim to ensure energy security and meet climate targets.
[According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for
critical minerals will nearly triple by 2030 and grow to over 3.5 times
the current levels by 2050, with minerals like lithium seeing an
eightfold increase due to their essential role in battery production.
The report lays out key recommendations for enhancing CRM mining, such
as the importance of speed, skills, infrastructure and local
engagement.]{.underline} T[o expedite development, governments are
encouraged to provide faster regulatory approvals and invest in
infrastructure such as roads, ports, power lines and rail
networks.]{.underline} Countries in the Arctic are taking steps to
capitalize on this potential. Canada, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and
Russia are all pursuing initiatives to bolster their mining sectors.
Notably, Canada has worked closely with Inuit communities to ensure
benefits are shared locally, while Greenland's projects are backed by
international investors like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos through Kobold
Metals. [The report also points out efforts to balance economic
opportunities with environmental protection, noting that indigenous
communities across the Arctic have expressed support for mining
projects, provided their rights are respected and traditional knowledge
is incorporated.]{.underline} This is particularly crucial as the Arctic
faces a rapidly changing climate, with temperatures rising four times
faster than the global average. The Arctic Mining Report 2024 presents
an argument for the region [being poised to be at the forefront of
supplying the materials necessary for a low-carbon future, making it
increasingly significant to the evolving green economy.]{.underline}

[The United States has smartly committed to the construction of a new

strategy**]{.underline} [to ensure that it is positioned to operate in
an Arctic that is seeing increased human activity --- and with it,
potential for conflict and natural disaster.]{.underline}

While the United States and its allies rightly criticize Beijing's
outlandish claims to being a "near-Arctic power," and fought its
position as an observer within the Arctic Council for many years, this
is becoming less of a defensible criticism of China. [With its annual
deployment of icebreakers and other research vessels to the Arctic each
year and its increased scientific and economic investments in the
region]{.underline}, **[China is in a position to have more presence in
the Arctic than the United States will for some time.]{.underline}**
[They may very well become]{.underline} (or perhaps have become) **[the

region.]{.underline}

Many point to the United States' strong alliances in the Arctic and say
that our strength is in our cooperation with Arctic like-minded
partners, four of which are NATO members. [But our Arctic allies are
also not immune to Chinese interest in the region and many seem to
**welcome China's increased role** as an **investor and cooperative

Militarization -- the big elephant in the room

[The strong militarization in the Arctic is the elephant in the room in

The geopolitical situation in the Arctic has worsened dramatically by
the Swedish and Finnish entry into NATO and the significant expansion of

Norwegian border, Russia has its large military base on the Kola
Peninsula with nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons.

### Permutation Answers

Note: These are analytical arguments against the perm created by the
members of the research group as the starting point for more specific
and focused answer to answer blocks depending on the exact permutation

#### Mutual Exclusivity- The Arctic Council operates by consensus and is grounded in trust, diplomacy, and multilateralism. If the U.S. acts unilaterally first, it violates that trust, making future collaboration through the Council impossible. The Council won't stamp a plan the U.S. has already decided on alone. The U.S. must choose to do it alone or cooperate multilaterally, not both.

#### Signal of Bad Faith- If the U.S. builds icebreakers or deploys Arctic infrastructure independently and then turns to the Arctic Council for help, it sends a message. That kind of opportunistic behavior undermines the legitimacy of the Council.

#### Collapses Solvency for Climate, Deescalation, and Indigenous Inclusion. The Council only functions when countries respect the process. If the U.S. enters with the outcome of the plan determined, it undercuts the very foundations of the Council's climate science collaboration, peacebuilding functions, and Permanent Participant engagement. 

#### The Perm Forces the Council to Endorse Militarization. Even if the plan is labeled non-military, the icebreakers have defense roles, missile defense, and deterrence.

#### The permutation links to the Russia DA (Maybe the arctic da). Trying to mix unilateral power projection and Council cooperation proves the exact aggression and threat inflation that Russia fears. That makes conflict more likely and flips the Aff's own deterrence logic.

#### Perm Forces the Worst of Both Worlds, Unilateralism causes backlash and multilateralism requires compromise. The perm gets neither full effectiveness nor full cooperation. It's a messy halfway that satisfies no stakeholder and causes internal contradictions that collapse solvency.

# Arctic Council CP Aff Answers 

#### 2AC---Solvency Deficit---CP does not solve all of the aff---

#### 2AC---Permutation---Do both---the plan and the cp can be done at the same time---combining both would make the plan seem non threatening to Russia

#### 2AC---Permutation---Do the plan and the part of the CP that incourages Russian re-integration into the Arctic Council---this solves the DA

#### 2AC---Links to the net benefit---The CP fails to deliver multilateral strategies\-\--Russia will view the CP as an attempt to push them out of the council and triggers conflict.

With much of the world's attention focused on US President Donald
Trump's historic visit to the Middle East or the fluctuating progress of
talks between Russia and Ukraine, a quiet but consequential event took
place last week that largely escaped notice.

In Norway, relatively low-level officials gathered for a closed-door
ceremony to mark the transfer of the Arctic Council's two-year rotating
chairmanship from Norway to Denmark. This may seem mundane. In fact it
was an important moment for one of the world's few remaining forums
where East and West, until recently, found ways to cooperate.

[**[The council]{.underline}**,]{.mark} established in 1996, [[brings
together the **eight Arctic states**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- Canada,
Denmark (through Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden,
and the US --- [[to collaborate on **non-military issues**]{.underline}.
[For years, it **functioned effectively** by focusing on **practical**,
**low-conflict areas** such as **environmental protection**, search and
rescue coordination, and oil spill response.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This pragmatic approach allowed the council to thrive, even during
periods of broader geopolitical tension. Crucially, it also includes six
indigenous organizations as permanent participants, giving the peoples
who live in the Arctic a direct voice in shaping its future. Observer
states, including faraway Singapore and major players such as China,
contribute expertise and funding, but have no vote.

[[This system worked --- **until it didn't**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The invasion of Ukraine by Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} in February
2022 [[**shattered** many channels of **cooperation** between Moscow and
the West, **including the Arctic Council**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Although Russia handed over the chairmanship to Norway in May of that
year, the customary fanfare was noticeably absent. Over the past two
years Norway has tried to keep the council afloat, but the breakdown in
relations with Russia rendered it largely ineffective. By the time
Norway passed the chairmanship to Denmark, the best that could be said
was that the council still existed.

[[Complicating matters further are suggestions by Trump that the US
might seek to **annex** **Greenland** and an unwillingness to **rule out
military force** to do so,]{.underline} [which have **alarmed NATO
allies** and **unsettled** the **Arctic Council's delicate
balance**.]{.underline}]{.mark} That may explain why it was Greenland's
foreign minister, rather than a Danish official, who accepted the
chairmanship on Denmark's behalf. How [[this tension between the US and
Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark} plays out within the council remains to be
seen, but it [[will not make **cooperation** any
**easier**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[With the council unable to conduct substantial work, its immediate
goal is simply to survive]{.underline}.]{.mark} Should a ceasefire or
peace agreement be reached in Ukraine, [[some might push to **quickly**
**revive the council**, but they would **face serious
headwinds**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since 2022, [[the **Arctic security**
landscape has **changed profoundly**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Norway's
newly released national security strategy describes its situation as
"the most serious \... our country has faced since the Second World
War."

What happens in the Arctic is often shaped by geopolitical currents
elsewhere, and increasingly what happens in the Arctic has consequences
across the globe.

[[Finland and Sweden]{.underline}, [previously militarily non-aligned,
have **joined NATO**, placing]{.underline} [**seven of the eight Arctic
states** under the same **security umbrella**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Their accession to the alliance would have been unimaginable before
Russia's invasion. [[The new Canadian government is **expanding** its
**presence in the Arctic**]{.underline}, [for geopolitical reasons that
are unlikely to **disappear anytime soon**]{.underline}: [Russia's
actions in Ukraine **have left deep scars**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This evolving environment also affects non-Arctic states seeking a
larger role in the region. China, for example, has been one of the major
losers of the Arctic Council's dysfunction. Beijing used the forum to
expand influence in polar affairs. With the council no longer
functioning as it once did, China has lost a key international venue. In
response, Russia and China have deepened their cooperation in the
Arctic, particularly on energy and infrastructure projects, driven
partly by Western sanctions.

If the Arctic Council does eventually resume full operations, expect
China to re-engage quickly to regain lost ground.

[[Another unresolved challenge concerns indigenous
representation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among the six permanent indigenous
participants is the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the
North. However, many indigenous Russians have fled the country and
formed exile organizations, such as the International Committee of
Indigenous Peoples of Russia. These groups seek a seat at the Arctic
Council table, but so far no effort has been made to include them.
Moscow would undoubtedly veto any attempt to do so. If the council hopes
to rebuild credibility, it cannot return to business as usual while
excluding exiled indigenous voices. Navigating this will be tricky, but
necessary.

[[Has the damage to **trust between Russia** and its **Arctic neighbors
gone too far** for the **council to recover?** It's too early to say,
but it **cannot be ruled out**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 2AC---No solvency---Trump thumps\--Trump's attempts to improve US-Russia relations undercuts the Arctic Council's role plus he will likely pull out of the Arctic Council or attempt to change it

Fourth, the one [Arctic state that Trump has attempted to improve
relations with -- Russia -- remains also problematic for the Arctic
Council]{.mark}. [[Trump's effort to work with Russia will make the
existing issues that the Arctic Council had with Russia even more
difficult.]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump has already called for the
Russians to be readmitted to the G-7. If he doesn't move to end the
Arctic Council, he will undoubtedly call for any sanctions against
Russia to be eliminated and for the country to be fully integrated.

At the same time he is actively moving to directly be involved in
assisting Russia to complete its conquest of Ukraine. In a move that is
reminiscent of the conquest of Czechoslovakia through the capitulation
of the U.K. and France to Germany in 1938, Trump has begun direct
negotiations with Russia without the involvement of the Ukrainians.
[[Putin now knows that it has the support of Trump.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[As a result, there is every reason to believe that Russia will
continue with its acts of aggression against its neighbours. This
includes both Sweden and Finland,]{.underline}]{.mark} who both chose to
join NATO. Putin has always made it clear that it was the possibility of
Ukraine joining NATO that was one of the reasons for his decision to
launch his war of aggression against Ukraine in 2014.

Scorched Earth Policy

Ultimately, this means that the Arctic Council now faces two terrible
scenarios. The first is that in his scorched earth policy toward
multilateralism, [Trump will either move to end the Arctic Council or at
least remove the U.S. as a member. He may also carry out his threat to
ensure that both Canada and Denmark also cease to be meaningful members
of the Arctic Council.]{.mark} If he truly does intend to take over
Canada, it won't even be a state. Even if he only means to weaken and
reduce Canada to a vassal state, its ability to participate will be
damaged -- if not eliminated.

Likewise, if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rationale for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated. Assuming that
somehow the Arctic Council survives an American withdrawal, and the U.S.
follows up its threats to control Greenland and Canada, the Council
would have only the active membership of Finland, Sweden, Norway and
Iceland.

Even if the U.S. remains in the Arctic Council, its current actions
means the gutting of some of its most important missions, The U.S. won't
support actions to eliminate the causes of climate change, and it is
very unlikely to support the Permanent Participants. Outside of the
Council, perhaps the Coast Guard forum will continue. But even here
[Trump is having an impact. He has already fired Admiral Linda Pagan,
the Commandant of the USCG.]{.mark} American officials have suggested it
was because of her commitment to DEI policies.

[Even more dangerously, this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Counci]{.mark}l. It would also include Denmark that has
either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take action to prevent
this. It will include a Canada that is being continually weakened by
American action, and is either actively trying to stop an American
takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S. It will also include a
Russia that is being increasingly supported by the U.S. and has been
given the right of conquest over Ukraine. Furthermore, if Ukraine was
conquered for considering joining NATO, the future of both Finland and
Sweden (which did actually join NATO) will undoubtedly be even more
problematic for Russia.

[[These are dire times for the Arctic Council. It is hard to think of a
way to maintain its many successes in supporting an understanding of the
impact of climate change on the Arctic. It has also played an important
role in supporting a greater awareness of the northern Indigenous
Peoples in the region. And perhaps most importantly, it has served as
the principal means of promoting a peaceful and harmonious international
regime of cooperation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[All of this is now at risk.]{.underline}]{.mark} Perhaps Trump won't
think that the Arctic Council is worth his attention, and it can somehow
remain under the American radar until the next presidential election.
But as many have said in the past, hope is not a strategy

[Nonetheless, the strengthening of the Sino-Russian relationship should
be of concern for like-minded Arctic nations and stakeholders. NATO and
the EU play a fundamental role in the High North, focused on different
but overlapping goals. NATO's primary focus remains on collective
security, but the EU can employ soft power capabilities. Sweden and
Finland's accessions to NATO, fueled by Russia's aggression in Ukraine,
have strengthened the Alliance but have also complicated collective
defense. NATO must now defend along a 1,340 km (830 mile) border with
Russia. However, Sweden and Finland bring extensive capabilities to the
Alliance, consolidating NATO's defense posture in the Baltics while
elevating regional activities, deterrence, and defense strategies.
Increasingly, the High North is no longer an isolated region, but an
extension of NATO's Eastern Flank, with the Baltic Sea acting as a
connector.]{.mark}

[[The security architecture of the High North region has fundamentally
shifted, even as some political uncertainty persists in the United
States' enduring commitment to the transatlantic relationship. During
HNSD, it was noted that while the US has periodic internal political
discourse that questions the US commitment to NATO, US policy positions
and associated actions to the Alliance have never faltered. The United
States has made a powerful commitment to the region in its new 2024
Department of Defense Arctic Strategy.]{.underline} A comprehensive
strategy designed for the evolving security environment, it highlights
the need to enhance Arctic capabilities, particularly for domain
awareness, communications, weather forecasting, and intelligence, engage
with Allies and partners, and exercise to improve regional
interoperability, particularly within the Alliance. [The strategy seeks
to preserve the Arctic as a stable region.]{.underline} ]{.mark}Indeed,
the United States and Russia share a 1,600-mile (2,575 km) nautical
border off Alaska, driving the two nations to reach agreement on key
fisheries and maritime traffic in the past.

Undoubtedly, [[Russia has significant legitimate interests in the
Arctic---it holds about 53 percent of the Arctic coastline and governs
just over half of the Arctic population.]{.underline} I]{.mark}n April
2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted at a Russian Security
Council session that "\[the Arctic\] is a concentration of practically
all aspects of national security---military, political, economic,
technological, environmental, and that of resources."3 Moscow continues
to preserve military strength in the Arctic region, with key forces
largely unaffected despite the war. [[Russia is conducting malign,
hybrid activities such as GPS jamming that deviate from adherence to
international customs and norms. Cutting undersea cables and disrupting
critical infrastructure are other capabilities Russia is
honing]{.mark}.]{.underline} For the Kremlin, the Arctic is both a
symbolic and strategic issue; [[Moscow no longer sees its interests as
being served through a cooperative relationship with the West. If,
however, Russia perceives cooperation in the region to be in its
interests, it will likely do so.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Arctic Unique Geopolitical Situation

#### Arctic security landscape is unique and evolving---traditional deterrence theories don't apply---the Arctic is a multipolar arena with economic and environmental elements as well

[The [Arctic security landscape is evolving]{.underline}. Climate,
economic, geopolitical, and technological trends are catapulting the
region to the forefront of security discussions. [Russia,]{.underline}
under President Vladimir Putin, [has demonstrated an increasing
propensity to disregard rule of law, international norms, and the
sovereignty of other nations]{.underline}, reminiscent of the Soviet
Union's approach during the Iron Curtain era. [Yet it is impossible to
uniformly apply old deterrence theories and strategic approaches to a
region that has evolved significantly since the bipolar era of the Cold
War.]{.underline}]{.mark} The post-Cold War collaborative unipolar world
has given way to an emerging bipolar or even [multipolar arrangement,
with four primary actors increasingly shaping the security landscape of
the High North: NATO Allies, Russia, China, and the European Union.
Environmental and economic drivers further complicate the security
situation.]{.mark}
