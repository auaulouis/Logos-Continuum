['Securitization' as a concept was first defined]{.underline} by Ole
Wæver in 1995 [in reference to the **discursive construction of
threats**.]{.underline} Since language constitutes the social world,
this also includes security and its features (Köhler, 2019:42).
[**Securitization**,]{.underline} as explained by the Copenhagen School,
[is the discursive process in which, "**an issue is dramatized and
presented as an issue of supreme priority**; thus, by labelling it as
security an agent claims a need for and a right to treat it by
extraordinary means" (Buzan et. al, 1998:26).]{.underline} Wæver argues
that [security and **threats are not an objective matter**. Instead,
**security discourse is characterized by the endeavor of which actors
construct issues as threats to security**, and granting an issue utmost
priority.]{.underline} [In essence, **the issue is a verbal construction
and presented as an existential threat.**]{.underline} A prerequisite is
that the issue of concern has to be accepted by a relevant audience in
order for political leaders to be suspended from normal politics and
enabled to take the emergency measures needed. Following this notion,
security is a form of negotiation between speaker and audience, though
significantly conditioned by the extent to which the speaker holds a
position of authority within a particular group (McDonald, 2013:72).
According to Wæver, a successful [securitization tends to involve the
articulation of threat]{.underline}, "only from the specific place, in
an institutional voice, by elites" (Wæver, 1995:57). These articulations
of threats come in the form of 'speech acts', which is a term borrowed
from language theorist John Austin (Buzan et. al, 1998). Speech acts
are, "conceived as forms of representation that do not simply depict a
preference or view of an external reality but also have a performative
effect" (McDonald, 2013:72). Speech act theory puts emphasis on the
function of language and focuses on the performance or words, sentences
and symbols (Balzacq, 2011:4). I[n other words, **the act of speaking
is** rule-guided action that possesses reality-making powers, and
therefore, stating is a performative act (Köhler, 2019:44). In this
sense, security is what the Copenhagen School notes as **a
'self-referential practice',** because by presenting an issue as a
security matter, it becomes one (Buzan et. al, 1998:24).]{.underline}
Originally, the speech act in itself was regarded as the process of
securitization but due to conceptual development, an issue is only
successfully securitized if and when the audience accepts it (McDonald,
2013:73). The audience's = acceptance is dependent on the form of speech
acts, the position of the securitizing actor and features that are
historically associated with the threat. These components of the speech
acts work under what is referred to as inter- nal and external
facilitating conditions (Buzan et. al, 1998:32). The three facilitating
conditions are (1) the demand internal to the speech act of following
the grammatical plot of designating an existential threat and arguing
for urgent untypical action, (2) the social conditions regarding the
position of authority for the securitizing actor (the relation between
the securitisizing actor and the audience) and, (3) features of the
alleged threats that either facilitate or impede securitization (Buzan
et. al, 1998:32). [That is to say, the first facilitating condition is
concerned with the 'grammar of security' which lays the ground for a
discursive plan that involves: **an existential threat, point of no
return and a possible way out**.]{.underline} Secondly, a condition
involves the social capital of the securitizing actor, who must be in a
position of authority. Since the audience is not necessarily fully
informed, it often relies on the discourses of state officials since
they are the site of constitutional legitimacy and therefore, must have
'good reason' to declare an issue as a threat to the state's survival.
Therefore, it is typically, in a sense, easier for actors who hold
influential positions in the security sector based on their political
capital to successfully securitize an issue. [Lastly, the condition
relating to the threat **involves the usage of objects that are
generally understood as threatening** in order to more successfully
**produce the idea of an existential threat.**]{.underline} In sum, the
theory of securitization has two central concepts which are the three
components of securitization - the speech act, the securitizing actor
and the audience -, and the three facilitating conditions outlined
above. In a 15 sense, the Copenhagen School looks at what security is by
looking at what it does (Rych- novská, 2014:10). For the Copenhagen
Scholars, the nature of present security issues is deeply related to the
politicizing of issues. [Security politics, are in their regard, not
only about emphasizing the preexisting threats, but also about the
performative activity that makes certain issues visible as threats
(Coskun, 2011:12) **Securitization is a further intensification of
politicization**,]{.underline} however in another perspective
politicization of issues presents them as a matter of choice and
decision while the process of securitization present an issue as urgent
and existential and therefore should be dealt with accordingly by
political leaders (Buzan et. al, 1998:29). So, politicized issues are
regarded as the body of everyday politics involving debates and
decisionmaking, while a securitized issue is placed 'above' normal
politics. Security is thus perceived as a negative by the Copenhagen
School, since it concerns a failure to deal with issues as normal
politics (Buzan et. al, 1998:29). Central is the fact that actors and
their audi-ences securitize certain issues as a specific form of
political act (Buzan et. al, 1998:33). The theory of securitization
provides a framework for analyzing matters of security and the process
of securitization. What the framework of securitization can bring to an
analysis is the means to identify something as a securitization move or
as the maintenance of a security discourse. [An analysis within the
framework of securitization therefore, does not set out to assess some
objective threat, but to understand the process of constructing a shared
understanding of what is to be considered and collectively responded to
as a threat. Securitization is studied by assessing the discourse and
political constellations presented.]{.underline} That is done by
studying when and how an argument with the particular rhetorical
structure achieves sufficient effect that makes an audience tolerate
violations of established rules (Buzan et. al, 1998). A successful
securitization is reliant on the features and quality of the security
speech acts. The analyst is interested in the construction of the
existential threat, since securitization can never be imposed and
therefore requires the speaker to argue the case. The Copenhagen
Scholars state that, "the existential threat has to be argued and just
gain enough resonance for a platform to be made from which it is
possible to legitimize emergency measures or other steps that would not
have been possible had the discourse not taken the form of existential
threats, point of no return, and necessity" (Buzan et. al, 1998:25).
[The representation of the existential threat is thus central to the
analysis of the securitization process. Therefore, as formerly touched
upon, threats are not just threats by nature, but have to be
**constructed through language by the speaker.**]{.underline} Specified
by Wæver, "a threat argument must perform to justify extraordinary
measures: it must establish (1) that there is a threat; (2) that the
threat is potentially existential; and (3) the possibility and relative
advantages of security handling compared to non-securitized handling"
(Wæver, 2011:473). The designation of a threat is closely related to the
framing of such. To frame is, "to select some aspects of a perceived
reality and make them more salient" (Entman 1993:53) The understanding
of framing is a specific type of discursive practice which come close to
and is often present in securitization. The exploration of threat
framing offers an insight to what traits and features are emphasized in
order to construct the idea of an existential threat. [Typically, the
speaker seeks to generate a]{.underline}

['we-feeling' and **to create an 'us'** which the audience can identify
with. **The construction of**]{.underline}

[**the 'other' or 'they'** is an automatic reflection of the 'us' and as
explained by Harle, "one]{.underline}

[cannot comprehend oneself fully if one has no appreciation of who and
what one is not"]{.underline}

[(2000:15). From a securitization perspective the interest lies within
the attributions of security]{.underline}

[problems rather than the actual origins of these. **Often the speaker
will attempt to 'actorize' the 'other**', meaning that "the other \[is\]
a willful chooser rather than a chain in a series of events" (Buzan et.
al, 1998:44). When the 'other', who is responsible for the perceived
threat, is viewed as a strategic actor able to make decisions, the
threat perception is = strengthened and thereby enables the issue to be
put onto the security agenda. This perception holds that the 'other', as
a decisive actor, "has the potential of outwitting us, of having
intentions, or of bending or suppressing our will to replace it with its
own" (Buzan et. al, 1998:44).]{.underline} Aside from the threat
perception constructed, the urgency of the security issue is a central
layer in securitization studies. Legitimatization of political action
often connects the past, present and future creating a timeline. [The
present is portrayed by political actors as a time where critical
decisions have to be made and vital action has to be taken. These
actions are often related to a cause, which happened in the past, and a
consequence, which might hap- pen in the future.]{.underline} In
political discourse, actors present a projection of the future according
to the actions taken in the present (Reyes, 2011:793). Therefore, only
according to the performance of an argument about the priority and
urgency of an existential threat, where the speaker has managed to break
free of ordinary rules that the actor would have been bound by, the
securitization of an issue has successfully occurred (Buzan et. al,
1998:25). Moreover, throughout the analysis specific words and phrases
alluding to feelings, interests and needs will be scrutinized. An
exploration will be done on the adjectives and verbs used to describe
features and actions of the 'self' and the threat, pursuing to
strengthen the threat perception. Likewise, metaphors along with
linguistic tactics that seek to attract and engage the audience will be
studied. The outline of the process of securitization and its framework
show that securitization theory is not a political statement called on
by the analyst but that it rather is a tool for analysis with which the
analyst can trace incidences of securitization. Therefore, it is
important to recognize that it is the speaker, and not the analyst who
chooses, whether some- thing is to be presented and handled as an
existential threat. In all instances, however, the analyst is obliged to
question the intended achievements of the securitizing speech acts
(Buzan et. al, 1998:42). The goal of the study of securitization is
summed up accordingly: "based on a clear idea of the nature of security,
securitization studies aims to gain an increasingly precise
understanding of who securitizes, on what issues (threats), for whom
(referent objects), why, with what results and, not least, under what
conditions" (Buzan et. al, 1998:32). The Copen-hagen School thereby
seeks, with the securitization framework, to provide a means to
investigate both the rules of 'speaking security' and how the power of
'spoken security' unfolds (Köhler, 2019:43). Securitization theory thus
seeks to answer the question: what does security do?

We've seen this before: [**paranoia dressed up as patriotism**, a
government casting suspicion by ethnicity. This time, it's Chinese
students. And it won't stop there.]{.underline} On Wednesday, under
orders from Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco
Rubio, [the Trump administration announced it would begin "aggressively"
revoking visas of Chinese nationals --- those studying in "critical
fields," or with supposed "connections to the Chinese Communist Party."
The language was deliberately vague. The implementation,
characteristically blunt. But the message was unmistakable: Chinese
students are no longer welcome.]{.underline} We can all speculate over
whether this originated with Rubio himself, who, after all, has been an
unstinting China hawk throughout his time in the Senate, or whether this
came from the Oval Office, where its narcissistic occupant, seething
under the humiliation of the deeply funny TACO meme, felt compelled to
lash out, look tough, and show the world that Trump does not, in fact,
Always Chicken Out. [At the very least, it's about the permission
structure --- the license within the administration coming from the top
that permits open bigotry.]{.underline} This has nothing to do with
genuine security review. If it did, we'd see defined criteria, credible
evidence, and some pretense of due process. What we're seeing instead is
performance --- a display meant to project toughness to a domestic
audience conditioned to see China as threat and Chinese identity as
inherently suspect. The most worrying outcome isn't just the personal
devastation for students or the blow to American higher education,
though both are considerable. [It's the way this kind of **policy spills
outward, accelerating a broader wave of Sinophobia**. When the federal
government treats Chinese students as latent threats, **it doesn't stay
confined to visa holders**. It bleeds into the popular imagination and
expands its targets. Most Americans don't stop to parse the difference
between Chinese nationals and Asian Americans, or between Han Chinese,
Koreans, and Japanese. In this climate, phenotype stands in for
affiliation. This won't stop with PRC passport holders. It never has.
What's taking root is something more ambient and more dangerous: the
idea that anyone who looks East Asian is suspect by
default.]{.underline} To be absolutely clear, it wouldn't be remotely
acceptable if it did stop at people with "Party connections," or Chinese
STEM students, or even PRC nationals. That would be bad enough, and more
than sufficient reason for outrage. But we've all seen how this plays
out. After 9/11 and the San Bernardino attacks, turbaned Sikh men ---
men who were not terrorists, not Arabs, not even Muslims --- were
assaulted and even killed by people unable to even try to distinguish
between religious identity and imagined enemy. Again, it would have been
no less bad had they been Arabs or Muslims. I share the view of the
Sikhs who said they were uncomfortable describing that violence as
"misdirected" because, as this report notes, "that invites questions
about violence being correctly targeted at Muslims." My point is simply
that just as anti-Islamic and anti-Arab bigotry spills its boundaries,
so too does Sinophobia. After COVID, there was a surge of anti-Asian
hate crimes across the country: verbal harassment, vandalism, beatings,
even murders. Most of the victims weren't Chinese, but that didn't
matter. The people committing these acts had absorbed a message: these
people don't belong. They're not us. No one will pause, before hurling
the epithet, or the fist, or the brick, to ask my daughter, my son, or
my wife whether they have "ties to the Communist Party," or whether
they're STEM students, or whether they're even mainland Chinese, or
ethnic Chinese at all. [What's infuriating is that even to point this
out --- to suggest that anti-AAPI hate is fueled by Sinophobia, by
ideological or political animosity toward China or its ruling party ---
is to invite suspicion in some circles. To say that Sinophobic rhetoric
has real consequences --- that it travels from press briefings and Truth
Social posts to sidewalks --- is to risk being accused of "repeating CCP
talking points," of "carrying water for the CCP." But that very
accusation proves the point. It reflects how deeply the logic of rivalry
has sunk its roots into the American political discourse. Some of us are
now so afraid of conceding narrative ground to Beijing, of letting
Beijing score a point, that even acknowledging racism at home is treated
as suspect. To me, that only proves how the zero-sum thinking on China,
the very hallmark of Sinophobia, has endured.]{.underline} To confront
the anti-AAPI hate that will assuredly follow in the wake of this (and
is already frothing up, to judge from MAGA world's enthusiasm for
Rubio's announcement), we need to speak plainly about Sinophobia. This
policy of visa revocations and expulsions isn't just paranoia; it's
moral panic masquerading as national security. When concern for civil
rights is made subordinate to geopolitical positioning, we're no longer
acting out of principle --- we're reacting out of neurosis. There's
something uncomfortably revealing about how easily this country now
accepts the logic of collective suspicion when it comes to China. Would
we be pursuing the same policies, with the same vindictive fervor, if
our strategic competitor weren't a nonwhite, one-party state with a
vastly different political culture? I doubt it. The racial dimension is
not incidental. It helps explain both the vehemence of the reaction and
the blindness to its consequences. [We're living in a time when loyalty
is judged by phenotype. And where noticing racism is itself seen as
subversive. We have e**ntered a feedback loop in which Sinophobia is
both a byproduct and a driver** of strategic rivalry. **It fuels the
antagonism, and the antagonism legitimizes the prejudice**. And in the
meantime, real people --- scientists, students, ordinary Asian Americans
--- are swept up in it, forced to prove loyalty or endure scrutiny
simply because of their heritage.]{.underline} (On the subject of
"proving loyalty," if you try telling me that the right reaction to this
is for the "good" Asians to drape themselves in the American flag, we're
going to have a problem.) This is not a theoretical danger. We saw it
with the "China Initiative," which ruined lives and careers before being
(partially) abandoned in disgrace. We see it now as universities quietly
shift policies on research collaboration, or turn away from
China-related partnerships out of fear of political reprisal. We see it
in faculty lounges and corporate boardrooms, in grant applications and
tenure reviews, where being Chinese --- or even "too close" to Chinese
colleagues --- starts to feel like a liability. And we'll see it again,
in uglier ways, as the broader public takes its cue from the
government's posture. That's how this works. When the state racializes a
threat, the public follows. That threat becomes ambient, and the
policing of it moves from institutions into everyday life. This could
have been avoided. The U.S. has every right to protect national
security, but it can do so without targeting ethnicity, without
collapsing individual identity into collective guilt. It is possible to
view immigrants and international students not as liabilities, but as
bridges. That's what many of them, like my parents, came here to be. But
when we start treating affinity for America as a test that must be
passed and passed again by people whose only disqualifying trait is that
they were born in a different country, we don't just betray them. We
betray ourselves. We give up the very idea that anyone can belong here
if they choose to. We begin to believe that allegiance is racial, and
trust is conditional. This isn't just a soft power loss. It's a lethal
tear in the fabric of our civic culture. And if we can't reverse this
--- if we keep allowing suspicion to stand in for strategy, and rivalry
to justify racism --- then we may well succeed in keeping out some
Chinese students. But we will also have shown, quite plainly, that our
professed ideals are no longer meant for everyone. We forfeited much of
the world's admiration long ago. But there was still, in some places, a
residue of respect for our openness, our education system, our ideals.
If we make it clear that those, too, are expendable in the name of
rivalry, we shouldn't be surprised when even that last member goes cold.

#### Sinophobia leads to WW3 conflict

Team Biden might have left office believing that it kept America out of
World War III, but it made so many decisions with a militarist bent that
it's far too early to declare even that much.

[**Zero-sum biases plague US foreign policy**, especially **toward
China**.]{.underline} And [Trump has inherited a China-obsessed war
machine]{.underline} that's even more lethal than the one he presided
over during his first term. [So if the end of everything were to happen
in the coming years, Biden's choices to heighten rather than
**ameliorate rivalry with China**---the world's other greatest
power---will almost certainly have been among its conditions of
possibility. For our planet to survive this era, the United States needs
to adapt to China (and the world) in a more relational and less
predatory way.]{.underline} But not only is that a tall order; the US
national security state itself actively impedes it. [A breakthrough
toward a more just and stable world will require resorting to politics,
not simply the bureaucratic production of policy.]{.underline} And while
violence is intrinsic to how Trump operates, he is, ironically, making
himself essential to keeping us out of World War III even as he makes it
more likely over the long run. [The "**Competition" Consensus**
Substantial evidence now exists that, whatever **disagreements about
China** may **reside within the US foreign policy community**, they are
minor, tactical, relative to the larger shared consensus in favor of
viewing China as a threat and a competitor that ought to be America's
foreign policy priority.]{.underline} While power hoarding and military
superiority have been a means and end of US foreign policy since at
least the 1980s, it is newly incompatible with the world as it actually
exists. We are no longer in the "unipolar moment." [A foreign policy
that tries to **claim a lopsided share of global power** in a multipolar
world **pushes the US to be more aggressive**, revisionist, as it flails
against the tide, unable to secure the position of domination it long
took for granted]{.underline}. Because [US goals are so extreme and
mismatched to reality, the result is what we have seen over the past
four years: heightened ethnonationalisms, **the securitization of
everything**, a breakdown of economic interdependence in favor of a
shift toward economic decoupling, and a fixation on preparations for
major-power war unseen since the Cold War.]{.underline} In Washington,
these ingredients for Armageddon find expression in the simple shorthand
"great-power competition"---a phrase that Trump has scarcely uttered but
that all of his foreign policy appointments have repeatedly stressed.
Marco Rubio, for example, declared great-power competition the priority
of an "America-First foreign policy" in his first cable instruction to
the State Department. [The anti-China consensus that Trump presided over
in his first term]{.underline}---but that in fact started under
Obama---[not only endures but is a profound obstacle for those wishing
to avoid World War III.]{.underline} A shift to something more peaceful
and enlightened than geopolitical rivalry is unlikely to come from
within the US national security state, which has fully retooled for
conflict with China. The hawkish groupthink that pervades how Washington
relates to China is hard to break when the US national security state
has banked the legitimacy of its institutional existence on indefinitely
chasing China's shadow around the world while optimizing for a war that
no sane person should want. The solution to Sino-US rivalry lay in
adopting a different approach that rejects primacy in word and deed, but
the ability to do that can only come from political forces outside the
national security state. What Is to Be Done The most enlightened policy
wonks in Washington advocate for "competitive coexistence" or
"congagement" (competition and engagement in parallel). This is more or
less what Biden attempted. But pursuing the brutality of great-power
rivalry with guardrails never made much sense, and neither did his China
policy. Sure, a new Cold War in which adversaries talk to each other is
preferable to a Cold War without direct communications; nobody should
want to live in a state of perpetual Cuban Missile Crisis. But zero-sum
statecraft is a dead end. [Any policy agenda premised on a
net-antagonistic relationship between the great powers facilitates a
process of hawkish outbidding within domestic politics, and as we have
seen the past decade, that divides America rather than unites it. A more
stabilizing, **war-averting existence** would accommodate power
realities rather than resist them at the point of a gun. The reason why
it is so hard to take America off the path to World War III is precisely
that the things that need to be done to better the world situation do
not lend themselves to simple policy interventions. Suspending
**military competition**,]{.underline} especially in nuclear
modernization, [is essential but]{.underline} literally [the opposite of
what a foreign policy of great-power competition demands.]{.underline}
Keeping China interdependent with the world---rather than trying to
sever it from the US and world economy---encourages Chinese restraint in
foreign policy, but is contrary to the economic nationalism that has
become en vogue. Increasing domestic consumption in China would help
alleviate the need for Xi Jinping to rely on ethnonationalist appeals to
sustain his political legitimacy, but only the CCP can take that
decision. And US financing of Chinese green tech for export in exchange
for China extending sovereign debt relief to the global South would
catalyze a virtuous cycle: Making good on a global green new
deal---\>resolving China's overproduction of electric vehicles and solar
panels---\>and growing consumer markets in the global South to provide a
new source of global growth. But coordinating a grand green bargain of
this ambition presumes habits of cooperation and mutual good will that
do not exist. None of these ideas amounts to pulling a lever or pushing
a button---that's the wrong way to think about changing the world.
Rather, they are worldmaking projects that cannot happen within a
strategy of primacy, whether described as an "America-First foreign
policy" or a "foreign policy for the middle class." Such slogans mask
the assumption that security is a scarce resource that must be hoarded
at others' expense. And that is just not true. [Overcoming Washington's
hawkish groupthink requires agents of change capable of contesting,
overriding, or redirecting the national security state's anti-China
fetish. The tragedy and the silver lining in this regard are the same:
Trump. American militarism cannot be tamed by those who are its purest
embodiment.]{.underline} As General Charles Horner once quipped,
"...don't count on the Pentagon to change the Pentagon...it has to come
from outside...The executive branch has to provide leadership." Where,
then, to turn? [Popular sentiment against war and **China-bashing** is
worth cultivating. Organized labor has been mostly aligned with
anti-militarism and peace activists in recent years---the transformative
potential of labor and peace is immense. But the reality is that Trump
is showing every sign of weakening labor activism and criminalizing
peace protests. The alternative, materialist prospects for overcoming
the China hawks, then, lay with two other forces: the imperial
presidency and the capitalists most dependent on a globalization-style
world.]{.underline} To take the latter first, the capitalist class is
disunified and consists of sections that either benefit or are harmed by
the ethnonationalist world of rivalry that is emerging. American
exporters (especially in agriculture) as well as firms who rely on
foreign markets to survive (like Hollywood) thrived in the old world of
neoliberal globalization. Crucially, they still need an interconnected
world for their business models to work. That makes them a
well-resourced power bloc on behalf of, if not peace, then at least
keeping war at bay and limiting the encroachment of "national security"
into every aspect of the economy. A different section of capital
directly benefits from great-power rivalry and the preparations for
World War III it entails. The defense technology industry,
cryptocurrency speculation, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and
semiconductor production are among the few promising growth sectors for
Silicon Valley venture capital (VC). In a peaceful world, these
investments have little promise but a world of nationalist conflict puts
them in the black. What all this means is that, as a political force,
some capitalists, in lobbying for restraint on the Trump administration
out of their own interests---as Elon Musk has appeared to do on behalf
of Tesla's business in China---will be doing work that rubs against the
great-power competition enthusiasts who run Washington. The decisive
force in the balance between war hawks and everybody else is Trump
himself. Trump's key political appointments on China---Marco Rubio, Pete
Hegseth, Elbridge Colby, Mike Waltz, and a slew of lower-level staff---
have so far all been extreme hawks favoring great-power rivalry. And
yet, Trump talks as if he is a conditional dove on China. Trump had a
friendly call with Xi Jinping upon inauguration. The opening tariffs he
imposed on China (10%) were lower than what he had previously
foreshadowed (and lower than what he announced for Mexico and Canada).
In his inauguration speech, Trump laid down a desirable rhetorical
marker: "We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but
also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we
never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and
unifier. That's what I want to be. A peacemaker and a unifier." Marco
Rubio, taking his cue from Trump, had a call with Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi on January 24 where he reportedly said that: "The
United States does not support 'Taiwan independence' and hopes that the
Taiwan issue will be peacefully resolved in a way accepted by both sides
of the Taiwan Strait." This is jarringly restrained and defies popular
expectations. China, so far, is even responding to the Trump
administration more favorably than it ever did to Donald Trump is no
dove. He did much to propel the anti-China hysteria that today plagues
Washington during his first term. And the national security state, now
led by Trump's China hawks, is poised to continue pursuing great-power
rivalry, which is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with the
world's fate. How ironic, then, that we are all somewhat trapped,
relying on Trump to be a much-needed voice of restraint in Sino-US
relations because the national security state and the Democratic Party
have refused the job. It is an unhappy situation, but such are the dire
straits that US policymakers have foisted upon us.

Climate breakdown is usually held up as the biggest, most urgent threat
humans pose to the future of the planet today.But [what if there was
another, greater, **human-made threat** that could **snuff** out not
only human **civilisation**, but practically the entire biosphere, in
the **blink of an eye?**]{.underline} As you read this, [about **4,000
nuclear weapons are poised for a first strike** across the northern
hemisphere, enough atomic firepower to kill as many as **700 million
people from blasts and burning alone.**]{.underline} And that is just
the start. [The explosions and fires -- like nothing seen on Earth since
the comet strike that led to the Cretaceous mass extinction -- would
loft enough soot into the stratosphere to cast an impenetrable shadow
over the globe. No light means no photosynthesis, the basis of planetary
foodwebs. No heat means that the surface of the Earth would plunge into
an icy, years-long winter.]{.underline} That is the message of Mark
Lynas, a British writer who for two decades has worked to help people
understand the science of climate breakdown while pushing for action on
carbon emissions. But after three years of research for a new book,
published last month, he now sees nuclear war as an even greater threat.
"There's no adaptation options for nuclear war," Lynas said. ["Nuclear
winter **will kill virtually the entire human population.** And there's
nothing you can do to prepare, and there's nothing you can do to adapt
when it happens, because it happens over the space of
hours.]{.underline} "It is a vastly more catastrophic, existential risk
than climate change." Lynas got started on his work on nuclear war in
2022, soon after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Like many born
into the era of the cold war, he was aware of the concept of nuclear
winter -- the likely environmental impact of a global thermonuclear
exchange. But what emerged from his research was far more horrifying. As
the rest of the world gradually forgot about the nuclear threat,
researchers began applying the new models of climate science -- the same
ones used to predict the developing threat of climate breakdown -- to
understand its dramatic implications. "The burning of the cities is the
mechanism that causes nuclear winter," Lynas said. "You get soot that's
lofted through pyrocumulonimbus clouds -- big, fire-generated thunder
clouds -- which pump \[it\], like a chimney, into the stratosphere."Once
it gets above the tropopause, into the stratosphere, it can't be rained
out. And because it's dark coloured, it catches the sun, heats up and
gets higher and higher. It gets probably totally dark at the surface for
weeks, if not months." A deactivated Titan II nuclear misisle in a silo
in Arizona. [**A new nuclear arms race is beginning.** It will be far
**more dangerous** than the last one.]{.underline} The temperature
rapidly drops below freezing. And it stays there, for years. "There's
never another harvest for humanity. The food will never grow again.
Because by the time the sun comes back out and temperatures rise again,
within a decade or so, everyone's dead." [How likely is this
scenario?]{.underline} Surely no one could be so reckless as to start a
nuclear war? Actually, says Lynas, they could. After all, the US did use
nuclear weapons against civilians in Japan in 1945, and since then there
have been numerous moments when the world stood minutes from nuclear
war, whether by accident or brinkmanship. [Today, both the **US** and
Russia have espoused **first-strike doctrines** that threaten the **use
of nuclear weapons even against conventional attacks**]{.underline}
(China, notably, has a policy of "no first use"). Meanwhile, nuclear
weapons continue to proliferate. The US and Russia hold the biggest
arsenals, with about 12,000 between them. China is racing to catch up,
with an estimated 500 as of 2024. Also armed are Britain, France,
Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea, with Iran apparently on the
cusp developing its own weapon -- a step that onlookers fear it may be
more likely to take after last week's attacks by Israel. And the
potential for error is also high. If US early warning systems went off,
its nuclear doctrine would give Donald Trump six minutes to decide
whether it was a glitch (which has happened) or to respond in kind.
Russia is said to have a "dead hand" system that would launch ballistic
missiles automatically in the event its own command and control
structures were disabled. So what can be done? We could stop ignoring
it, for a start. Lynas calls for the revival of an anti-nuclear weapons
movement on a scale to match that of the present-day climate movement,
although he has criticisms of past such movements. "On the success side,
it had some very dedicated people who devoted their whole lives to this
issue, in quite large numbers," he said. "But it was also politically
very, very left of centre, very kind of hippy, peace movement type thing
-- women-only spaces. And that kind of stuff, of course, then means that
anyone who's politically centrist or right centre isn't involved. "And
if you have a very narrow political base in your movement, you're going
to have a very narrow success rate." Lynas disavows unilateral nuclear
disarmament as naive, and maintains -- unlike previous anti-nuclear
campaigners -- that nuclear power is not only not a threat, but possibly
a massive benefit to human civilisation, not least because of its
potential for producing low-carbon energy. Nevertheless, some of his
suggestions are quite radical, including treating everyone in the chain
of command in the "nuclear nine" states, from leaders down, as a
potential war criminal, subject to legal restrictions and sanctions in
states that choose not to hold nuclear weapons. In spite of all the grim
possibilities, Lynas sees hope -- and in unusual places. "Trump gets
credit for basically shaking things up in a way which could lead to a
more positive outcome," he said. Much as it took another Republican
president, Ronald Reagan, to kickstart the US and Soviet disarmament of
the 1980s, so Trump could do what Democrats, eager to prove their
strength, could -- or would -- not. "And you know, maybe his bromance
with \[Vladimir\] Putin and Kim Jong-un or whatever will bring them to
the table."

## Research Securitization 

### Research Advantage links 

#### Securitization runs deeper than just defense-- It's the systematic exclusion of countries who are deemed threats. It's being intentionally planted in academia and overly justified by a "need for protection".

Lapland, 25**

[The securitization process has led Western governments to impose direct
and indirect restrictions on research concerning Russia and China.
Following the Russian war on Ukraine, the European Union Commission
decided to suspend cooperation with Russian entities in research,
science and innovation. A great majority of the EU member states (with
the exception of Hungary), Norway and Great Britain gave national level
ministry level bans forbidding universities and research institutes
collaborating with their Russian counterparts.The collaboration and
partnerships with Chinese research institutes, enrolling Chinese
researchers and academic work on China has also been subjected to
restrictions.]{.underline} [This process began during Trump's first
presidential term as]{.underline} a part of his China containment
policies. [Trump famously stated in August 2018 that "\[A\]lmost every
student that comes over to this country \[from China\] is a
spy"]{.underline}ii [As a part of this policy the Department of Justice
launched their]{.underline} "China Initiative" [campaign that carried
out]{.underline} detailed [investigations on US university researchers
affiliated]{.underline} with China [or being of Chinese origin. Despite
the campaign directed at finding Chinese spies]{.underline} on US
campuses [the result was embarrassing -- no one was convicted or even
charged with spying in any]{.underline} China Initiative [case. The
Initiative reportedly largely targeted individuals based on any
connection to China or scientists of Chinese heritage, and increasingly
targeted "research integrity" issues and was accused of racist practices
rather than economic espionage and hacking.]{.underline} iii [These
policies also reached Europe where nation states and security
authorities restricted and warned universities of China related
collaboration. The Russian war on Ukraine in 2022 and Beijing's open
reluctance to condemn the illegal war of aggression created a situation
where all China-related research and collaboration are seen as a
security risk. The securitization pressure on academia is even
broader.]{.underline} [For instance, US embassies are contacting
university leaders and funding agencies behind the curtains asking
universities to align with Western policies against China and domestic
security apparatus are warning of perceived risks involved in China
collaboration.]{.underline}

#### The Securitization narrative enables western hypocrisy and suppresses objective knowledge

[The silencing force of the securitization narrative and measures are
legally questionable as these measures can be seen as hindering the
freedom of academic research and freedom of expression guaranteed by
laws and constitutions in Western]{.underline} liberal [democracies.
This silencing is not conducted under Martial Laws]{.underline} of these
countries, [but merely as ministry level stipulations or EU Commission
decisions. Furthermore, different universities]{.underline} in given
countries [are interpreting these]{.underline} ministry-level [orders
differently.]{.underline} [The most famous case being the treatment
of]{.underline} Emeritus [Professor Lassi Heininen]{.underline} of
University of Lapland and Visiting Researcher [at Aleksanteri Institute
of Helsinki University. Heininen participated in an international
conference arranged in Moscow together wit]{.underline}h a number of
[other Western scholars. Consequently, the University of Lapland
stripped him of his Emeritus Professor contract]{.underline} whilst
Helsinki University did not punish Heininen for participating in this
conference. [Notably, no other Western participant was punished by their
home universities.]{.underline} [This kind of treatment questions the
principle of equality in and between respective countries.]{.underline}
[The securitization narrative is most visible in]{.underline} the [news
media and how news media select]{.underline}s the [specialists for
interviews]{.underline}. [When news is solely produced through a
security lens, not only policy-makers receive a limited perspective but
the wide public gets a skewed and negative stigmatizing understanding of
these countries.]{.underline} [This limited perspective reinforces a
cycle in which perceived threats are amplified, and the danger of
denouncing all Chinese and Russian people as potential threats becomes
"a truth"]{.underline}. [Funds for research critical of securitization
policies are increasingly limited, pushing scholars toward
self-censorship or pro-securitization narratives. Consequently,
researchers fearing repercussions may avoid controversial topics or
choose an approach that aligns with prevailing securitization
narrative]{.underline}. [This self-censorship can also spill over to
publications, where editors may be reluctant to publish work that could
be seen as challenging the dominating Western views on Russia or China.
Furthermore, the securitization cloak limits our possibilities to
discuss with liberal and critical Chinese or Russian researchers who
have deep personal knowledge of their domestic societal moods and
potential policy trajectories.]{.underline} By keeping in contact with
these researchers we can also express our support for them. [These
chilling consequences have implications for fact-based policy making due
to limited access to Chinese or Russian liberal voices. One-sided news
broadcasts combined with self-censorship omit insights to potentially
alternative trajectories of these societies. When certain narratives or
interpretations are prioritized over others, and others are silenced,
the actual hard-core security and other policy making becomes one-sided
due to a lack of diversity in perspectives.]{.underline}

[The securitization narrative restricts academic freedom, drives
self-censorship, and narrows the scope of scholarly inquiry]{.underline}
related to Russia and China. [It will cast a long shadow over research
related to these countries. By emphasizing security over a broader and
open approach to these countries, we miss opportunities for gaining
understanding of potential alternative societal
trajectories]{.underline} of these countries [and are not able to have
constructive engagement that could have significant global implications.
The prevailing securitization trend raises ethical, legal and practical
questions about the boundaries of academic freedom. Maybe the most
alarming is that the securitization narrative and practices harm the
actual democratic values we cherish. This paradox has not gone
unnoticed]{.underline} in China and Russia [and is, as a matter of fact,
providing powerful propaganda tools for autocratic rulers boosting their
political legitimacy. By displaying this paradox Chinese and Russian
state-lead media expose our Western "double speak" -- how we speak of
freedom]{.underline} of speech [whilst we readily silence domestic
critical voices. There is a danger that we have entered a securitization
dominated world where only very few]{.underline} brave [academics voice
their concerns.]{.underline} [This is reminiscent of the Communist Party
governed Poland that reminded "a room where people unanimously maintain
a conspiracy of silence, one word of truth sounds like a pistol
shot,"]{.underline} in the words of Polish Nobel laurate of literature
(1980) Czesław Miłoszv . [It is notable that the Nobel Committee
recognized him for his writing in dissident silencing Poland of the
1980s, which \"with uncompromising clear-sightedness voices man's

## Health Securitization 

### Health and disease securitization links 

#### Securitization justifies the daily suffering of minorities through inadequate healthcare, more in favor of prioritizing potential diseases with pervasive impacts

**[Health as an issue of national security has been well-established
over the last three decades.]{.underline} Jeremy Youde provides [a
useful discussion of both advantages and disadvantages of health
securitization, identifying that while health securitization can garner
attention for an issue (evidenced in the AIDS epidemic), and resources
to address it that might be activated on a global scale, it
simultaneously can feed into an us-versus-them mode of thinking (Youde
[2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR96)).]{.underline}
Youde identifies the negative elements of increased surveillance, and
the reproduction of paternalistic relationships between global North and
South. [Stefan Elbe
([2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR21))
looked closely at the global AIDS pandemic through the lens of
securitization theory, as revelatory of the normative dilemma at the
heart of securitization of health (Elbe
[2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR21)).
This normative dilemma is characteristic of securitization in general:
while securitizing something may raise awareness and, crucially, may
direct state funds towards a targeted issue, it simultaneously invites
military responses that often involve the suspension of civil rights and
liberties, and it raises a threat-defence logic (2006).]{.underline}**

**[The racialised dimensions of AIDS are well-established in health
literature with racial and ethnic disparities evident in infection rates
and outcomes]{.underline} (Stone
[[2012]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR77);

Elbe
[[2006]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR21)).
[While there are racialised tendencies to apportion 'blame']{.underline}
and to control movement, [minoritized people are more likely to die from
AIDS]{.underline}: this is not a discretionary behaviour of the virus,
rather [it reflects extant health inequalities that can be observed both
globally and more locally in individual states.]{.underline} As Youde
([[2008]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR95))
warns in his discussion of the potential securitization of Avian flu
H5N1, [securitization of health involved 'us-versus-them'
thinking]{.underline}, and evoked efforts to guarantee flu vaccines
(Youde
[[2008]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR95)).
[The effort to prepare for a pandemic in case it happened *in America*
before human-to-human transmission was known, was the priority and
arguably displaced AIDS and other real-but-distant ongoing crises such
as Malaria from the global health agenda.]{.underline} As Sophie Harman
(Harman
[[2021]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR34))
succinctly argues:**

**[[The health issues that threaten millions of lives in low- and
middle-income countries but pose very little risk to high-income
countries are rarely considered to be matters of global health security
and so are not prioritised, while simultaneously people]{.underline}
[living in low- and middle-income countries are then framed as the
threat to the West, as vectors of disease, and are thus subject to
discrimination which is often highly gendered and racialized. Global
health security thus both exacerbates and reproduces inequality by
creating a hierarchy of health issues]{.underline} (Harman
[[2021]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR34):

**[Infectious disease lends itself to securitization]{.underline}, as
Metelmann et al. argue (Metelmann et al.
[[2022]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR59)).
Of course, [the securitization of Covid-19 is the quintessential example
of securitization justifying the suspension of civil liberties on an
extreme scale, albeit one that varied by country, in the context of a
health emergency.]{.underline} [Metelmann et al. explore the
implications for non-communicable disease,]{.underline} and
[specifically disease treated by surgery---but this could also be
applied to other public health issues.]{.underline} These authors find
that [surgery specifically has low securitizing potential and this is in
part due to its high infrastructural demands: surgery requires public
investment.]{.underline} The authors note that [there is a bias towards
prioritising infectious diseases because]{.underline} [the means of
addressing them are relatively simple]{.underline} [and do not always
necessitate high-leve]{.underline}l medical [expertise]{.underline}
(such as containment, and vaccine programmes). Surgical disease on the
other hand cannot be contained or addressed in the same way: for
example, appendicitis is not infectious and cannot be prevented with a
vaccine programme. The authors demonstrate this argument with the
evidence that the 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern'
([PHEIC]{.underline}) [declarations of the last decade all referenced an
infectious disease despite the fact that public health, and therefore
public health security, is]{.underline} of course [much
broader.]{.underline} [What is perhaps]{.underline} as---if not
[more]{.underline}---[significant than resources, is that
non-communicable disease]{.underline} such as appendicitis [does not
lend itself to an us-versus-them logic and therefore does not evoke the
logic of security.]{.underline}**

**In terms of global health security, the WHO has taken an increasingly
significant role on deciding the security exception (Hanrieder and
Kreuder-Sonnen
[2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR31)).
As Hanreider and Kreuder-Sonnen discuss, this top-down institution with
no direct enforcement capability can usefully draw on security language
to activate the capacity of states to enforce containment of infectious
disease. While the WHO might be the securitising actor in this context,
the audience that co-constitutes the threat is the state, and states
retain the responsibility to make and implement security policies.This
can operate as a means of protecting the most vulnerable. Nevertheless,
there are varied and intersectional forms of vulnerability, exacerbated
by massive inequality in the world. Recent [work on the Covid-19
pandemic has begun to draw attention to]{.underline} some of these
[significant]{.underline} [vulnerabilities attached to inequality and
power.]{.underline} [Where the spread of the]{.underline}
[infectious]{.underline} [virus was securitised, it raised significant
insecurities for people at risk of suffering domestic abuse]{.underline}
(Kourti et al.
[[2021]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR48)).
[Risks linked to low socioeconomic status such as unstable income and
financial uncertainty that are linked to mental health and heightened
stress were exacerbated by lockdowns]{.underline} (Patel et al.
[[2020]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR66)).
[A special issue]{.underline} of *American Behavioural Scientist*
[explored the]{.underline} cross-cutting and intersectional
[inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic, revealing the interplay of
race and ethnicity and socio-spatial inequalities]{.underline} (Kuk et
al.
[[2021]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR49)),
and the gendered disparities produced by home-schooling and gendered
domestic structures (Bariola and Collins, 2021). [Additionally digital
inequalities, which]{.underline} might be socioeconomic but also
[intersect with other variables such as age, education, and disability,
were linked to bodily stress and anxiety during the Covid-19
pandemic]{.underline} (Robinson et al.
[[2020]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR68),
[[2021]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR70)).
[The relevance here is not to make an argument about the efficacy of
lockdown or to critically assess responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, but
to demonstrate that there are particular public health-based
insecurities and vulnerabilities that can be directly produced by an act
of health securitization. Securitizing acts in one area produce
insecurity and vulnerability in another.]{.underline}**

**[The securitization of health is by necessity inclusive when dealing
with communicable disease, or at least it is acknowledged that an
inclusive approach is necessary]{.underline} ([while the objective is
still]{.underline} the security [of the in-group, the inclusion of
outsiders is by necessity rather than true inclusivity)]{.underline}.
Yes, [the inclusivity is simultaneously *exclusive*: while including
those with the potential to spread communicable disease within the
country in public health efforts such as vaccine programmes, where
spread can be controlled marginalised populations tend to be
controlled.]{.underline} [Health inequality tracks societal inequality:
the worst outcomes of endemic disease can be seen in the poorest
communities]{.underline} (Whitehead et al.
[[2021]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR91)).
[Visibly oppressive mechanisms]{.underline} include the tendency to
[apportion blame.]{.underline} [For example,]{.underline} Sjostedt
([[2010]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR74))
marks that [HIV/AIDS in the US structured the disease as affecting
'guilty victims,']{.underline} drug addicts and homosexuals who could be
dissociated from society, [and 'innocent victims,' people who were
susceptible to the disease through no fault of their own]{.underline}
such as haemophiliacs and the spouses and children of carriers. [It is
only through publicity of the suffering and death of an 'innocent'
victim that the disease captures the public]{.underline} imagination [as
a security threat.]{.underline} That threat concerns 'the military's
ability to defend the homeland, or whether immigrants posed a threat to
the American nation (Sjostedt
[[2010]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR74):
158). This reality was played out in the internment of Haitian refugees
in 1993, who were not permitted to enter the USA because they were HIV
positive (Ibid). Indeed, immigration controls are exercised on even---or
especially---the most vulnerable populations as a means of making
security for citizens.**

**The means of pursuing health security, such as closing borders and
policing the body, clearly evidence the overlap between health
securitization and immigration securitization: indeed, borders closed
during the Covid 19 pandemic, and covid passports circumscribed entry to
particular spaces---at national borders but also in local social
environments. [The securitization of health also targets resources: a
means of directing needed resources to health services highlights
simultaneously resource scarcity that feeds into the othering processes
that might be applied in terms of deservingness]{.underline} attributed
through the hierarchies of citizenship, but also in terms of resource
extraction. This is simultaneously fed by the securitization of
immigration, where economic security and the idea of protecting social
services compose part of the identified threat. For example, pregnant
migrants may be seen as a drain on resources and therefore face racism
and discrimination in the community. Here, introducing gender as an
intersecting vulnerability logically follows. In health care settings
pregnant migrants are often charged for services. In the UK, the
national healthcare system introduced charges for pregnant migrants in
2015, which amount to 150% the cost of care. Thus, migrants in need are
overcharged, an act which reiterates the idea that they are a burden on
healthcare services, not just in terms of expense but time and
resources. The effect is a reduced uptake of antenatal care, which can
lead to increased complications and vulnerabilities later on in
pregnancy, birth and post-natal (Fair et al.
[[2020]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-024-00584-7#ref-CR24)).
Disability, and health conditions might be discriminated against and
bodies devalued where health is securitized. Age offers another vector
through which inequality in health securitization might be apparent.
There are specific obscurities with regard to female and reproductive
health that are significant points of inequality in the context of
health securitization.**

#### The healthcare securitization allows for under-represented groups, specifically immigrant women to be overlooked during resource/fund allocation and pandemics/diseases.

evidenced is through healthcare systems]{.underline} (Viero et al.

[Violence might not be disclosed, but if medical treatment is sought
then violence is often detectable.]{.underline} Healthcare settings may
be one of the few places a woman can safely disclose abuse---this is
particularly true of populations that face barriers to disclosing
violence or abuse to the police (Thiara and Roy, 2020). [Healthcare
settings tend to capture---by necessity---populations that are
conventionally hard-to-reach. This information-capture is not perfect
but is often better than that of other services. Yet, identifying
violence against women is not always a priority in pressured healthcare
systems, particularly during winter months when efforts to treat
seasonal illness require resources, and resources are overstretched and
underfunded. When health is securitized such as in]{.underline} the case
of communicable [disease or pandemic]{.underline}, [this lack is
exacerbated.]{.underline} [The effect then, on immigrant
women]{.underline} in insecure statuses and [with no access to public
resources or funds, is that they are made more vulnerable and more
insecure.]{.underline} Further inequality can be linked to immigrants in
insecure status with complex health needs or disability. [The
securitizing actions in the context of health and immigration do not
create this vulnerability, which is already there as normalised everyday
violence. They do, though, make this vulnerability more
acute.]{.underline} Attending to these securitizing actions and their
intersectional effects through considering the experience of *being
securitized* can help make visible vulnerability, inequality and
violence.]{.mark}**

**[Securitization]{.underline}**, as conceptualized by the Copenhagen
School, [involves the **legitimation of**]{.underline}

[**exceptional** means to defend a valued object.]{.underline} Security
threats are discursively [constructed by an authoritative actor using
security language to compel a political community to recognize
the]{.underline}

[threat.11 If the threat is recognized, the response is shifted from
normal politics to security]{.underline}

[politics]{.underline} where exceptional measures are permitted.12
[Successful securitization entails actions]{.underline}

[related to policing, surveillance, and the violation of rights and
rules that a democratic]{.underline}

[government would otherwise be expected to abide by.]{.underline}13
Discourse is used to study securitization since securitizing moves
follow a "grammar of

security" in which a serious and imminent threat is described that can
only be dealt with using

exceptional measures.14 Discourse can be defined as a "specific ensemble
of ideas, concepts, and categorizations that are produced, reproduced,
and transformed in a particular set of practices and through which
meaning is given to physical and social realities".15 [Social realities
are not merely **described but are created**; they produce actions and
**exercise power**.16 Additionally, discourses are historical and exist
within particular cultural and social contexts.17 As I will elaborate
further, the]{.underline} post-9/11 environment in the extractivist[,
**settler colonial societies** of Canada and the US provided the
conditions for critical infrastructure to be conceptualized as under
threat and for environmental and Indigenous activists to be considered
threats.]{.underline} Securitization entails further questions such as
what must be protected, what threatens it, and who accepts the existence
of a threat. The specific referent object is critical infrastructure,
but it represents a larger way of life facilitated by extractivism.
Post-9/11, countries, their citizens, and

the liberal, democratic, capitalist way of life were believed to be in
need of protection. Critical

infrastructure was included as a threatened object in this context
because its obstruction or

destruction could be life threatening and it would also impede regular
capitalist functions.

Though critical infrastructure can be threatened by a variety of factors
such as weather events

and lack of maintenance, security policies are concentrated on the
threat of intentional sabotage

to critical infrastructure. The audiences accepting security measures to
protect critical

infrastructure against terrorism were politicians, and the citizens they
represent, who supported

new security policies. The audience accepting that environmental and
Indigenous activists

specifically threaten critical infrastructure is limited to security
agencies and corporations as they

were the creators and recipients of this specific discourse, not the
wider public.

Not all security moves are made within the public eye, yet they still
fit this security

model.18 Post-9/11 an initial securitizing move was made in the US and
other countries that

claimed that there was a serious and urgent threat to their way of life
which necessitated

measures that had to be kept secretive. In the legislation that emerged
from this period in Canada and the US, critical infrastructure was
included as an object threatened by terrorism and hence its protection
is primarily dealt with in the realm of security. Later discourse from
security agencies specifying environmental and Indigenous activists as
threats to critical infrastructure was not public. However, the
construction of activists as threats was still authorized by the
post-9/11

security conditions which allowed security measures to operate out of
the public's view.

Though the Copenhagen School advocates for studying public discourse to
prove

securitization without concern for underlying motives, I expand my aims.
[Beyond establishing]{.underline}

[the securitization of critical infrastructure in public discourse, I
also examine documents that]{.underline}

[were intended to be kept out of public view as they illustrate how
environmental and Indigenous activists have specifically been targeted
and how this was done to protect **extractive industries.**]{.underline}
Given the secretive nature of these matters, the accessibility of
information was limited. For public documents, I analyze national
publications, policies, and legislation. The private government and
corporate documents that I examine were leaked or published through news
reports or other researchers. Prior to the examination of this
discourse, I will review some

conditions that facilitated the securitization of critical
infrastructure including the importance of

extractivism, the past treatment of environmental and Indigenous
activists, and the features of the 3. Extractivism and the Settler State

[Under extractivism, **natural resources are a commodity** whose
production is necessary for]{.underline}

[capital accumulation and consumption.19 Extractivism extends back to
the foundations of modern capitalism and has carried forward to the
present day with the same characteristics of]{.underline}

[exploitation and unrestricted growth. Extractivism has global
dimensions. Imperialist countries]{.underline}

[exploited resources in colonies in South America, Africa, and Asia to
support their capitalist]{.underline}

[development, patterns which have continued to this day.]{.underline}
Countries in the Global North rely on

extraction in the Global South to fuel their consumption, and resource
rich countries in the

Global South rely on exporting natural resources to sustain their
economies.20

The movement of resources is not exclusively from the Global South to
the Global North,

however. Extractivism crosses borders in many ways as countries in the
Global North engage in

extractivism domestically as well as internationally. [Regardless of the
country, extractivism is]{.underline}

[marked by inequality. Extractivism most benefits corporations and those
in power while]{.underline}

[negatively impacting the communities where the extraction takes place
in ways relating to their]{.underline}

[health, safety, and human rights.]{.underline}21 [In Canada and the US,
**extraction projects are** commonly located in marginalized communities
with dominantly poor, racially marginalized, and]{.underline}

[**Indigenous populations.2**2 Settler colonialism in Canada and the US
is based on accumulation and private property.23 In the present day,
**settler states still expect unimpeded access to Indigenous lands
and**]{.underline}

[**resources to exploit** and extract from for profit.24 **Private
corporations remove the resources from Indigenous lands, supported by
settler governments** who praise the economic opportunities for
citizens.25 The vested interests of governments and corporations in
extraction **compel the use of security measures to address actions that
impede this process.**]{.underline}26 The protection of critical
infrastructure is also the protection of the underlying ideologies of
extractivism which corporations and governments in Canada and the US
seek to preserve. The operation and expansion of critical
infrastructure, specifically energy infrastructure, fuels consumptive
ways of life and access to the market. Oil and gas account for 5.6% of
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) and approximately 8% of the US'
GDP.27 Data from 2018 show that Canada was the fourth largest exporter
of crude oil and fifteenth largest importer while the US was the seventh
largest exporter and second largest importer.28 Though these numbers are
22 For more examples of environmental racism in the US, see Sarah
Mittlefehldt, "Wood Waste and Race: The significant, they alone do not
account for the importance of extraction in Canada and the US.
Government leaders work in collaboration with extractive corporations to
boost job creation or GDP figures for political support, to receive
financial contributions from such corporations, or because of their
personal interests and investments in extractive industries.29 Oil and
gas companies operating in Canada and the US devote substantial amounts
time and money lobbying politicians.30 In 2019, oil and gas companies
spent over \$125 million dollars lobbying American politicians.31 In
Canada, though lobbying contributions are not publicly available,
records show that oil and gas companies and associations enjoy frequent
meetings with politicians.32

Corporations further influence governments to act according to their
established interests in

Extraction. Threats to the extractivist system like those coming from
environmental and Indigenous activists which challenge not only the
expansion of infrastructures but the ideologies of extraction, are
pacified so that governments and corporations can continue to benefit
from it. In Canada and the US, this has been done through the
construction of environmental and

Indigenous activists as security threats to critical infrastructure.

14\. The Security State

Following the 9/11 attacks in New York City, the US and several of their
allies, including

Canada, fortified security states characterized by the policing and
surveillance of groups perceived to be threats, a blurring of
criminal/extremist/terrorist categories, information sharing across
police and security networks, and expanded police mandates.33 Successful
securitization permits exceptional actions and this environment
facilitated new and expanded security Measures. Those who contradicted
the prevailing capitalist, extractivist logic had been targeted by
security agencies in Canada and the US previously. The surveillance of
Indigenous activists is not a distinctly post-9/11 practice. Indigenous
people asserting their sovereignty and protecting their land have been
policed by settler colonial states from the beginning of colonization.34
Colonial policies were implemented to survey and control Indigenous
peoples, carried out by departments and policing forces which exist to
this day.35 Environmental activists have previously been pursued by
security agencies, particularly in the US. Throughout the 1990s,
corporations that were criticized and vandalized by environmental
activists lobbied for serious security measures against them.36 It was
not until the post-9/11 environment facilitated the broader security
mandate and impetus for results that environmental activists were
pursued as

"eco-terrorists" but this process demonstrates the alliance between the
government and

corporations on matters of security and the weakened distinction between
criminal and terrorist

activities.37 While there are features of the security state that
predate 9/11 and environmental and Indigenous activists have previously
been targeted by these measures, the post-9/11 period marks an important
transition because there was widespread recognition of a threat, more
expansive security measures were legitimized, and these security
measures were authorized to take place out of the public's view. 4.1
Security Measures in the US

The security state in the US involves agency and stakeholder
collaboration to pursue

wide mandates using secretive and heavy-handed measures. The Patriot
Act, passed shortly after 9/11, authorized an expansive set of security
measures and provided large budgets and

organizational structures to enact them.38 The Patriot Act allowed
surveillance and information

gathering like wiretaps and weakened the need for probable cause or
transparency.39

Additionally, collaboration between government agencies was encouraged
and institutionalized.

The US government supported fusion centers which facilitate intelligence
sharing between local,

37 Examples of security measures include the pursuit of terrorism
charges for environmental activists, see Potter, "The Green Scare,"
673-675; the use of private security firms hired by corporations to
watch and infiltrate environmental organizations, see James Ridgeway,
"Black Ops, Green Groups," Mother Jones, state, and federal agencies as
well as the private sector.40 These fusion centers allow for the
exchange of information that certain agencies would not otherwise have
access to.41 4.2 Security Measures in Canada

The presence of a serious attack close to home and pressure from the US
as Canada's major

defense and trade partner influenced Canada to expand their security
state.42 Similar to measures introduced in the US, Canada's 2001
Anti-terrorism Act expanded police powers, the scope of surveillance,
and the budgets provided for security purposes.43 With the expansion of
police powers, matters of conventional crime and matters of national
security became muddled.44 Canada's security network, like the US',
involves a range of agencies and departments that consult one another,
share information, and collaborate with the private sector. These
institutional and cultural changes to security in Canada and the US
provided the conditions which allowed the securitization of critical
infrastructure to take place.

5\. Discourse on the Securitization of Critical Infrastructure

Critical infrastructure and the continued access to extraction that it
facilitates are protected by

the Canadian and American governments. Public documents establish the
threat to critical

infrastructure without naming specific actors as threats. Private
documents reveal connections

between extractivism and national interests and claim that environmental
and Indigenous

activists are threats to these practices. I will now analyze public and
private documents from

Canada and the US that illustrate the securitization of critical
infrastructure.

5.1 American Securitization of Critical Infrastructure

The Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as

(S)ystems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the
United States that the

incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a
debilitating impact on

security, national economic security, national public health or safety
or any combination

of those matters.45

While specific facilities are not named, this definition establishes the
connection between

infrastructure and national security threats. President George W. Bush
stated that terrorists

sought to attack critical infrastructure "to threaten national security,
cause mass casualties,

weaken (the) economy and damage public morale and confidence".46 This
statement pairs the

loss of lives with the weakening of the economy as well as linking the
proper functioning of

critical infrastructure to the identity of American citizens. Critical
infrastructure is established as

a valued object and its potential destruction is taken seriously due to
these suggested effects.

The President's National Strategy for Homeland Security issued in July
2002 expands on

the Patriot Act's definition of critical infrastructure to cover more
sectors. The Strategy includes

the agricultural, public health, emergency services, telecommunications,
transportation,

chemical, finance, and energy sectors as critical infrastructures and
links them to freedom,

security, and the economy.47 Critical infrastructure policies emphasize
the need for collaboration with private corporations and integrate them
into security processes through practices like information sharing.48
This partnership is not unreasonable as 85% of critical infrastructure
is owned by the private sector, however, by asserting that critical
infrastructure is threatened by

terrorist attacks, expansive security measures become authorized which
can be used to

accomplish corporations' aims. 49

Recent state legislation illustrates government and corporate interests
in safeguarding

ongoing extraction. In December 2017, the American Legislative Exchange
Council released a

policy model called the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, inspired
by a law enacted that

same year in Oklahoma. The model uses the Patriot Act's definition of
critical infrastructure to

criminalize trespassing on critical infrastructure facilities including
oil and gas pipelines.50 By

making the offense related to trespassing rather than destruction, a
wide range of activities,

including peaceful ones, can be captured by such laws. The fine amount
and jail term are left

blank on the model legislation for states to fill in with their own
specifications. The punishments

have ranged from \$250 to \$100,000 fines and thirty days in jail to ten
years imprisonment 19

depending on the state and the nature of the offence.51 The model
legislation has inspired laws in numerous states and bills are already
in the legislative pipeline in others.

The model legislation or the laws based on it do not name specific
groups. The model is

worded broadly in order to encapsulate any actions that could damage or
obstruct the function of critical infrastructure and thus impact the
profits of the corporations that own it. While these

states already have laws for trespassing and vandalism, the new laws
emphasize the seriousness of disruptions to the extraction of resources.
Though this is state, not federal, legislation and it does not address
security measures specifically, these laws are another representation of
how critical infrastructures are seen as valued objects under threat by
opponents whom must be deterred through extreme measures, in this case
hefty fines and jail time. The crafting and promotion of the model
legislation reveals even more about the

interconnectedness of government and corporate interests. The American
Fuel & Petrochemical

Manufacturers lobbying group representing America's largest oil and gas
companies helped to

draft the policy model and promote it to states in response to the
Dakota Access Pipeline

protests.52 Governments and corporations protect extraction through
criminal legislation but can simultaneously or alternatively use
security measures to remove and deter opposition. The role of extractive
industries in drafting the legislation shows that these corporations
were concerned about environmental and Indigenous activists and wanted
to expand their abilities to handle potential disruptions to their
profits in the future. Leaked documents further indicate the specific
targets of critical infrastructure protection. In

an unclassified document from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
titled "Threats to Keystone XL Pipeline Projects within Houston Domain",
protesters were labelled as

"environmental extremists" while the pipeline was described as "vital to
the security and

economy of the United States".53 This document suggests that critical
infrastructure is protected because of its economic benefits and
activists are purposefully targeted because they can impede profits. A
field report from the Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration
with several state fusion centers, uses a similar term, "environmental
rights extremists" to refer to pipeline protesters.54 The field report
makes an additional connection to depict protesters as threats to
national security by claiming that Indigenous activists from Canada who
travelled to join the Standing Rock protests included "violent
extremists" who came with weapons and riot gear.55 Economic interests
and national security interests are conflated in matters of critical

infrastructure, giving its protection the sense of importance and
urgency that is needed for

securitization. Cross-border support for activists is interpreted as
foreign interference to national

interests. This idea of foreign interference is only applied to the
actions of activists and not to

proponents of extraction projects. Pipelines often have international
dimensions since many cross through the Canada-US border and are owned
by companies from various countries, yet these 53 Paul Lewis and Adam
Federman, "Revealed: FBI violated its own rules while spying on

corporations are not accused of foreign interference because extraction
is seen as a national

Interest. 5.2 Canadian Securitization of Critical Infrastructure

Canada's conception of critical infrastructure is detailed in the 2009
National Strategy for

Critical Infrastructure by Public Safety Canada. Critical infrastructure
refers to processes, systems, facilities, technologies, networks, assets
and services essential to the health, safety, security or economic
well-being of Canadians and the effective functioning of
government...Disruptions of critical infrastructure could result in
catastrophic loss of life, adverse economic effects, and significant
harm to public confidence.56

This definition juxtaposes "catastrophic loss of life" and "adverse
economic effects", indicating

that they are of similar importance.57 As with the American definition,
the Canadian conception

of critical infrastructure emphasizes its importance to the function and
identity of the country.

Connections between security and national interests in extraction are
further revealed

through Canada's Counter-Terrorism Strategy which defines critical
infrastructure as "energy,

transportation and oil and gas assets" rather than a broader conception
that includes other

sectors.58 Critical infrastructure protection is placed directly within
the realm of security. The

Anti-terrorism Act of 2015 includes "interference with critical
infrastructure" as an activity that

undermines the security of Canada.59 The Act authorizes security
measures including

information sharing among government departments and the broad
discretion of security services

to reduce threats to the security of Canada. Corporations are integrated
into critical infrastructure protection as the Canadian government makes
clear that it is achieved through partnerships with corporations and
that the goals of the private sector are aligned with those of the
country.60 Canada's Counter-Terrorism Strategy represents an unusual
public document as it openly alludes to environmental and Indigenous
activists as threats. The Strategy notes that domestic

extremism often relates to "environmentalism and anti-capitalism" and
can resort to violence.

These forms of domestic extremism are compared to the Oklahoma City
Bombing and the 2011

Norway attacks, which likens social issue protests that have largely
remained nonviolent with

two far-right terrorist attacks that killed nearly one thousand
people.61 Even though this

document does not specifically claim that environmental and Indigenous
activists are violent, the

association between deadly terrorist attacks and the activities of these
groups serves to connect

them with one another. These government documents clearly identify
critical infrastructure as a

valued object that is threatened by terrorism and extremism, including
from domestic actors.

Private documents indicate the motives for the securitization of
critical infrastructure and

clarify whom security agencies declare as threats. Declassified reports
from the Royal Canadian

Mounted Police (RCMP) show that security agencies are concerned with a
"radicalized

environmentalist faction" and about specific environmental organizations
such as Greenpeace

and the Council of Canadians.62 The RCMP and other government agencies
also consistently

investigate and monitor Indigenous rights activists including those
opposed to resource

"Aboriginal extremists" and environmental non-governmental organizations
(NGOs). The

assessment emphasizes the potential for, or presence of, violence among
these groups.65

The wording of the RCMP assessment connects Canadian identity and
well-being to the

petroleum industry and evokes suspicions of foreign interference by
highlighting the foreign

(mainly American) donations to environmental NGOs.66 The assessment
treats environmental

concerns and the connections between resource extraction and climate
change as mere claims

while supporting extractive industries.67 The assessment even quotes the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers' assertion that "Canada is
uniquely positioned to supply an abundance of safe, secure energy".68
Though the assessment was not intended for public view, it shows how
extraction is framed as a crucial practice to Canada. Claiming that
extraction is important to national interests enables security agencies
to treat opposition to extraction as a security concern.

The assessment expands on the securitization of critical infrastructure
in public discourse that

identifies it as a valued object under threat. As a private document, it
shows the intentions of

security agencies in targeting environmental and Indigenous activists to
protect extractivism.

Discourse from Canada and the US shows the securitization of critical
infrastructure. Though

policies in both countries recognize that critical infrastructure can be
threatened by accidents and

natural events, they clearly assert that critical infrastructure is
threatened by intentional sabotage.

[To protect critical infrastructure, agencies and departments have been
created or re-organized, budgets have been allocated, security measures
have been approved, and permissibility has been granted for these
efforts to be kept secret.]{.underline}69 Security measures and the
secrecy in which they

operate were authorized because of a perceived threat of terrorism in
the post-9/11 environment

but they continue to operate in Canada and the US beyond a state of
emergency or imminent

threat. These security powers are used to advance economic interests and
target environmental

and Indigenous activists by suggesting that they engage in, or have the
potential to engage in,

serious acts of criminality, extremism, or terrorism.

The securitization of critical infrastructure in the US is more
secretive in some senses and

more explicit in others. Security powers are broad and hidden in
America. Public security

documents establish that critical infrastructure is threatened by
terrorism but keep the conception

of terrorism broad. State critical infrastructure laws also do not name
specific groups but their

creation by oil and gas executives in response to the Standing Rock
protests make it clear that

critical infrastructure is protected because of profits which
environmental and Indigenous

activists can challenge. In Canada, critical infrastructure protection
is undertaken in a securitized

way, though the use of more public critical infrastructure criminal
charges could be used in the

69 Philip Boyle and Shannon Speed, "From protection to coordinated
preparedness: A genealogy of critical future.70 Public documents provide
evidence of a securitizing move establishing the importance

of critical infrastructure and its threatened nature. In practice, and
as shown through private

documents, security measures to protect critical infrastructure are
directed at environmental and

Indigenous activists specifically because they obstruct extractivism.

While the majority of infrastructure in Canada and the US is privately
owned and its function

is important for the well-being of citizens, the security state's
actions to protect critical

infrastructure go beyond the intentions of safeguarding citizens to
safeguarding capital. Security

and policing forces in Canada and the US have acted alongside
corporations to protect

continuing extraction. Confrontations between security agencies and
environmental and

Indigenous activists in Standing Rock and Wet'suwet'en lay bare the
security state's real targets. 70 Alberta has passed a similar law to
the American Legislative Exchange Council's model legislation, the
Critical Infrastructure Defence Act. This law imposes significant fines
and possible jail time for individuals who damage or obstruct critical
infrastructure. See Sean Fine, "Alberta tables bill that would jail
pipeline protesters for up to six months, impose major fines," The Globe
and Mail, February 25, 2020,

#### Securitization of the arctic leads to climate change and food scarcity of the indigenous.

**Khan, commentator on global security issues, 21**

\[Sahar, 6-17-2021, \"The Arctic's Securitization\", Inkstick,
[[https://inkstickmedia.com/the-arctics-securitization/]{.underline}](https://inkstickmedia.com/the-arctics-securitization/),
July 15, 2025, HDCSW-SH\]

[Securitization is the process]{.underline} of something becoming a
security threat or a security issue. It happens [when
something]{.underline} --- such as immigration --- [is labeled as
dangerous, threatening, and as an existential crisis by someone, and
then that framing is accepted by an audience.]{.underline} Importantly,
securitization implies that security issues are not just out there.
Instead, [by creating security threats in the way we speak, we create
security issues.]{.underline} While the Arctic might seem like a
peripheral region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to
rise in importance. [Concerns about China, Russia, and resource
competition are causing real changes to occur in how states treat the
Arctic.]{.underline} The United States, for example, has announced the
establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be housed within
the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique challenges and
security concerns related to the Arctic region." As climate change has
resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access to resources in the
Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United States, Russia,
Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden --- and non-Arctic
states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a few --- have grown.
[The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of oil, gas, and
minerals that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states.]{.underline} A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as [China,]{.underline} are
[finding investment opportunities with Arctic states]{.underline} to
build infrastructure as part of the Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt
and Road Initiative), it [is by no means a necessity to treat Chinese
influence as inherently negative.]{.underline} By the same logic,
Russian investment and military actions in the Arctic might seem overtly
negative, but it is important to contextualize Russian interest in the
Arctic as not recent, but historic. Instead, the rhetoric around these
issues has treated them as critical security risks, [painting the Arctic
as the next theater of a new Cold War.]{.underline} But is the Arctic
really the next theater? [Rather than focusing on these interstate
threats, there are more serious concerns, such as climate change and
insecurities that stem from it --- such as food, water, environmental,
and health security concerns]{.underline} --- that affect individuals
and impact their quality of life. For example, [Alaskan communities are
suffering from food insecurity because sea ice is melting]{.underline},
causing traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise hunt, to move
elsewhere and decreasing their protection from the large ocean waves
that have in some cases caused devastating infrastructure damage. [On
Little Diomede Island,]{.underline} for example, [a late storm caused
serious damage to a water treatment plant, leaving the town without
clean water and without power. By over-emphasizing "hard" security
issues from Russia and China, therefore, the rhetoric surrounding Arctic
politics ignores other important questions that impact people on the
ground, particularly Indigenous people whose livelihoods and societal
resilience are threatened by climate change.]{.underline} The most
significant concern when it comes to treating the Arctic as a theater of
great power competition is the danger it presents in putting the Arctic
on a trajectory of becoming a securitized region. While it can be argued
that as it stands, the Arctic is not a contested region or a region
fraught with wars, such as the Middle East and parts of Africa, it could
be if the trajectory of treating the Arctic as this region of
competition and security continues. [Regions of the world do not become
theaters of competition and conflict overnight,]{.underline} but instead
become that way after years of construction that involves a range of
activities from rhetoric and to military buildups. [Crimea is a telling
example]{.underline} of this, where [both Ukraine and Russia slowly
began ratcheting up bellicose discourse over time which was followed by
militarization. Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension between the two
states.]{.underline}
