The biodiversity turn is predicated on 'natural resource', but also
cognitive resources. Speaking to Escobar (2012) , Hale (2002) and Ulloa
(2013) , Leanne Betasamosake Simpson commiserates:

[When there was a push to bring traditional knowledge into environmental
thinking]{.underline} after Our Common Future in the late 1980 s, [it
was a very extractivist approach: "Let's take whatever teachings you
might have that would help us right out of your context, right away from
your knowledge holders, right out of your language, and integrate them
into this assimilatory mindset]{.underline}." [It's the idea that
traditional knowledge and indigenous peoples have some sort of secret of
how to live on the land in a non-exploitive way that broader society
needs to appropriate]{.underline}. But [the extractivist mindset isn't
about having a conversation and having a dialogue and bringing in
indigenous knowledge on the terms of indigenous peoples. It is very much
about extracting whatever ideas scientists or environmentalists thought
were good and assimilating it]{.underline}.... put it onto toilet paper
[and sell it]{.underline} to people. [There's an intellectual
extraction, a cognitive extraction]{.underline}, as well as a physical
one. ( Klein & L. Simpson, 2012 ).

[Land, biodiversity and knowledge are]{.underline} the [primary
frontiers of extractivism under the green economy]{.underline}.
[Sustainable development, or "greening," assimilates traditional
ecological knowledge]{.underline} (TEK) [into statist circuits and in
the service of techno-capitalist progress, preforming a 'cognitive
extractivism']{.underline} (see also Grosfoguel, 2016 ; Kröger, 2022 ).
The [green economy is a statist instrument that advances the conquest
and reconfiguration of human and nonhuman nature, protecting and
advancing techno-capitalist trajectories,]{.underline} while [promoting
the belief of ecological and climate catastrophe
mitigation]{.underline}. [The green economy serves a
counter-insurrectionary function to preserve the state and global
capitalist system]{.underline}.

It is common today to recognize that [climate change represents a
"global existential threat"]{.underline} that places in jeopardy the
very survival of humanity. Today we are faced with a situation in which
the [continual expansion of capitalism based on]{.underline} the
[burning]{.underline} of ever larger amounts of [fossil
fuels]{.underline} [points to the]{.underline} possibility---even
[probability, if the system of production is not altered
radically]{.underline} in a matter of decades---[of the downfall
of]{.underline} industrial [civilization]{.underline},
[placing]{.underline} the [survival of humanity in
question.]{.underline} This is the meaning of environmental exterminism
in our time. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), net zero carbon dioxide emissions must be reached by 2050
if the world is to have a reasonable hope of keeping global average
temperatures below a 1.5°C, or even a 2°C, increase over preindustrial
levels. Not to accomplish this is to invite the devastation of the earth
as a safe home for humanity and innumerable other species.

[Climate change is part of a]{.underline} more general [planetary
ecological crisis associated with the crossing of planetary
boundaries]{.underline} in general, [including]{.underline}
those---beyond climate change itself---related to [species
extinction]{.underline}, stratospheric [ozone depletion, ocean
acidification, disruption of]{.underline} the [nitrogen and phosphorous
cycles, loss of]{.underline} ground cover/[forests, declining fresh
water]{.underline} sources associated with desertification[, atmospheric
aerosol loading, and]{.underline} the introduction of novel entities
(new synthetic chemicals and new genetic forms).52 To this should be
added the [emergence of new zoonoses, as in]{.underline} the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic, resulting principally
[from]{.underline} the [agribusiness transformation of]{.underline} the
[human relation to the environment]{.underline}.53

Yet, there is no doubt that climate change is at the center of the
current global ecological crisis. Like nuclear winter, it poses a threat
to civilization and the continuation of the human species itself. Even
now, the [IPCC tells us]{.underline} in its most recent reports
(2021--22) on the physical science of [climate change]{.underline} and
its [impacts]{.underline} that the most optimistic scenario, though
warding off irreversible climate change, [is]{.underline} still one [of
growing global catastrophe]{.underline} in the decades ahead, [and
requires immediate action to protect]{.underline} the
[lives]{.underline} and living conditions of hundreds [of]{.underline}
millions, and perhaps [billions]{.underline}, of people [who will be
exposed to extreme weather]{.underline} events of a kind that global
civilization has never seen before.54 [To counter this requires the
greatest movement of workers and peoples]{.underline} the world has ever
seen in order [to restore]{.underline} the [conditions of their
existence]{.underline}, which have been usurped by the regime of
capital, [and]{.underline} to [reestablish an ecologically sustainable
world rooted in substantive equality.]{.underline}55

Ironically, the latest IPCC report, which was meant to draw world
attention to the catastrophic nature of today's climate crisis and the
rapidly worsening prospects for humanity if revolutionary-scale changes
are not made, was published on February 28, 2022, four days after the
Russian entry into the Ukrainian Civil War in defiance of NATO,
resulting in growing concern over the possibility of a global
thermonuclear exchange. Hence, the world's attention was drawn away from
considering one global existential threat, endangering all of humanity,
namely carbon omnicide, by the sudden reemergence of another, nuclear
omnicide.

Still, even as the world turned its attention to [the possibility of war
between the leading nuclear powers]{.underline}, [the full planetary
scale of the nuclear threat,]{.underline} as understood by science in
terms of nuclear winter, was absent from the picture. [Global warming
and nuclear winter]{.underline}, though arising in different ways, [are
closely connected in climate terms, demonstrating]{.underline} that [the
world is on the brink of destroying most]{.underline} of the
[inhabitants of]{.underline} the [earth]{.underline}, in one direction
or another: [global warming over decades leading to a point of no return
for humanity]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the [death of hundreds of
millions by nuclear fire, followed by]{.underline} global
[cooling]{.underline} in days and months, [exterminating]{.underline}
most of [the rest of the]{.underline} world's [population through
starvation]{.underline}. Just as the [full destructive implications
of]{.underline} [climate change]{.underline} threatening the very
existence of humanity [are]{.underline} in large part [denied
by]{.underline} the [powers]{.underline} that be, [so are]{.underline}
the full planetary [effects of]{.underline} nuclear war, which
scientific research into nuclear winter [tells us will]{.underline}
effectively [annihilate the population of every continent]{.underline}
on Earth.56

Today [we are confronted with a choice between exterminism and the human
ecological imperative.]{.underline}57 [The causal agent in the two
global existential crises]{.underline} now threatening the human species
[is capitalism and its irrational quest for exponentially increasing
capital accumulation and imperial power in a limited global
environment.]{.underline} [The only possible response to this unlimited
threat is a universal revolutionary movement rooted in]{.underline} both
[ecology and peace]{.underline}, turning away from the current
systematic destruction of the earth and its inhabitants, and providing

[[Ecosocialism embodies the premise that both humans and nature have a
common enemy in capitalism (Stache, 2019). As such, ecosocialism aims to
respond directly to the social and ecological crises and injustices of
capitalism.]{.mark} While strategies to realize this are lacking, core
principles are repeated throughout the literature that [most
ecosocialist diverges agree on; (1) the means of production being
democratically planned and collectively owned (]{.mark}Albert, 2023;
Park, 2013), [effectively removing class stratifications
(]{.mark}Stache, 2019) [and the commodification of labor]{.mark} (Johns
et al., 2003), [(2) prioritizing use-value over
exchange-value]{.mark}]{.underline} (Albert, 2023; Johns et al., 2003),
(3) [[decreasing energy and material consumption in the Global North
(]{.underline}]{.mark}Albert, 2023), [[and (4) simultaneously
redistributing resources to the Global South]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Albert, 2023). The objective of realizing such principles is to create
a way of life for all humans that provides a good standard of living
while ideologically situating humans within the ecological system and
thus striking a balance between nature and humans (Stache, 2019;
Lalander & Lembke, 2018). According to Stache (2019), this can be
established by adopting a needs-based economy and a culture of
cooperation, both of which are echoed in all four principles[. The
challenge with establishing such an objective is that it requires "a
transformation of revolutionary proportions"]{.underline} (Stache, 2019,
p. [143). Such a revolution would need to be democratically realized via
a socialist and counterhegemonic movement or organization, likely
involving temporary reforms that connect with everyday politics (Stache,
2019). In order to realize an ecosocialist]{.underline} [transformation
and establish ongoing sustainability, the efficient utilization and
further creation of technologies compatible with ecosocialist
sustainability]{.underline} principles (Stache, 2019) is imperative and
constitutes an additional obstacle. Just as Stache (2019) highlights the
need for a revolution, Lalander and Lembke (2018) speak of the need for
a collective critique of development as a first step in acknowledging a
need for an ecologically integrated social system. Imperatively, this
involves both material transformations and a cultural shift, ensuring
that collective needs are met rather than being driven by the pursuit of
endless accumulation (Lalander and Lembke, 2018). While cultural mindset
shifts are crucial, they must be accompanied by concrete structural
changes, such as reclaiming commons, redefining ownership and promoting
ecological stewardship, democratic socio-ecological and economic
planning, and post-capitalist governance mechanisms (cf. Hosseini, 2023,
Kovel, 2014). As such, ecosocialism ideology is in stark contrast to
capitalism ideology and this constitutes the overarching obstacle we
face as a collective in achieving ecosocialism. The imperative to
strategize becomes more apparent. Albert (2023) argues that strategies
for transformation in the ecosocialist movement are severely lacking and
that by pre-emptively analyzing such strategies for transformation,
ideal transition pathways and the anticipation of potential crises can
be realized, ultimately giving ecosocialism a chance to be implemented.
The scope of ecosocialism demonstrates its strengths and weaknesses.

The weaknesses of ecosocialism relate to its requirements for a shift in
mindset, its claims to fully address the structural problems of
capitalism, as well as the lack of strategy for transitioning from a
capitalist system. Many ecosocialists speak to Indigenous knowledges and
structures for acting as catalysts and/or examples of ecosocialism
(Kovel, 2014; Lalander & Lembke, 2018; Stache, 2019). However, Kovel
(2014) notes the difficulty of instilling Indigenous ways of thinking
into the collective, which is further compounded if the presence of
Indigenous cultures has been suppressed by capitalist domination. In
contrast, concerns about romanticizing Indigenous movements have also
been raised (Stache, 2019), and it's important to acknowledge the risk
of appropriating or oversimplifying such movements and to respect the
autonomy of the peoples, traditions, and ideologies. While Indigenous
ways of thinking can instill ecosocialist ideology, specifically with
regard to ecology, it is the political and economic forces that favor
capitalist ideology that pose the biggest obstacle. [Ecosocialism aims
to combat the structural problems of capitalism, and to this degree,
there are doubts that economic descaling, consumption reduction, and
political devolution, as idealized in ecosocialism, would result in
ideal social conditions for an ecologically sustainable and]{.underline}
socially just society (park, 2013). Examples of this are whether
descaled economic communities will have the means to gather resources to
develop and effectively utilize eco-friendly technologies (Park, 2013),
and localism strategies compound this, raising questions around the
scarcity of natural resources and equality issues for areas that lack
essential resources (Park, 2013). [Echoing this are questions about
whether socialist alternatives are capable of only minimizing structural
problems in comparison to capitalism, rather than entirely combating
them (Johns et al.,]{.underline} 2003). For example, Johns et al (2003)
ask whether it's possible to extract what billions of people need or
want without some form of social hierarchy and ecological exploitation
that renders environments less balanced than they would be otherwise.
Lastly, [[the detailed strategic planning for ideal trajectories of
transition from current (neoliberal) capitalism to ecosocialism is
lacking, leaving questions around the tangible step-by-step actions
required and ultimately decreasing the likelihood of
implementation.]{.mark} In reference to this, it [can be argued that
rather than negate the feasibility of ecosocialism, such weaknesses
instead act as obstacles; growing awareness and education around climate
change and social justice issues due to social media means a collective
shift in mindset regarding politics and economics is already
growing]{.mark} (e.g. use-value over exchange-value is the premise of
'opportunity' shops which have been growing in popularity) [and need
only be enhanced; concerns for ecosocialism's capacity to address
structural problems do not negate the massive progress that would be
realized via its implementation, and lastly, strategic deficiency can be
remedied if ecosocialists come together to formulate trajectories and
plans of action]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Military and economic development in the Arctic secures capitalist power at the expense of Indigenous peoples

Arctic Extractivisms." *Journal of Political Ecology*, Vol. 34, Issue 1,

[The Arctic]{.underline} region also [contains security and military
interests of nation-states, as well as political and economic
interests]{.underline} (Heininen, 2014). For instance, integral parts of
modern industrialized nation-states include Sápmi in Fennoscandia, the
Yukon in the Northwest territories and Nunavut in Canada, and the
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous region of the Russian Federation. In short,
[almost all Indigenous homelands have been claimed and controlled by
nation-states to the south of the Arctic. Different state-corporate
nexuses, located outside the circumpolar North, impose their own
economic interests for which both land and resources are
needed]{.underline} (Muller-Wille, 1987). [In the process, Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} of the Circumpolar North [lose access to and
control over their land and its traditional use]{.underline}.

Within this context, [development projects and planning in the Arctic
are]{.underline} being [driven by ideas of advanced technological
progress and economic growth]{.underline} (Egerman et al., 2003). [Some
of its regions are integral parts of modern industrialized
nation-states]{.underline} (although this is not the case for Greenland,
an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark) (Muller-Wille,
1987; Nuttall, 2012). These [states cater to particular economic sectors
and corporations in different extractive sectors, easing their access to
Arctic Indigenous and other territories]{.underline}.

The Canadian state is notorious for supporting via diplomacy, spying and
other operations the global expansion of the mining industry (Bélanger,
2018; Keeling and Sandlos, 2015). The Canadian state-mining nexus
continues to provoke major socio-ecological injustices in many parts of
the world including the Arctic, as in the forceful expansion to
Fennoscandia and particularly Finland by Canadian gold and other mining
companies (Kröger, 2016).

In Alaska, the [oil and gas extraction business has been marked
by]{.underline} recent [attempts]{.underline} of the Trump
administration (2017--2021) [to open up drilling in conservation areas.
Arctic policies may change with government fluctuations following,
however, a general trend to extractive expansion.]{.underline} Besides
Russia, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has been an
important player building major logistical and military infrastructures
in the Arctic]{.underline}. After the end of the [Cold War]{.underline}
in the 1990s, these [infrastructures are]{.underline} currently [being
rebuilt, to serve resource extraction and great power
competitions]{.underline} (Dodds and Nuttall, 2019). These militaristic
goals play a major role in the Russian contemporary attempts to claim
sovereignty over Arctic territories and resources. Other Arctic powers,
especially the Nordic states, seem to be much less inclined to expand
militarily and forcefully to grab territories or resources (Kröger,
2019).

develop and effectively utilize eco-friendly technologies (Park, 2013),
and localism strategies compound this, raising questions around the
scarcity of natural resources and equality issues for areas that lack
essential resources (Park, 2013). [Echoing this are questions about
whether socialist alternatives are capable of only minimizing structural
problems in comparison to capitalism, rather than entirely combating
them (Johns et al.,]{.underline} 2003). For example, Johns et al (2003)
ask whether it's possible to extract what billions of people need or
want without some form of social hierarchy and ecological exploitation
that renders environments less balanced than they would be otherwise.
Lastly, [[the detailed strategic planning for ideal trajectories of
transition from current (neoliberal) capitalism to ecosocialism is
lacking, leaving questions around the tangible step-by-step actions
required and ultimately decreasing the likelihood of
implementation.]{.mark} In reference to this, it [can be argued that
rather than negate the feasibility of ecosocialism, such weaknesses
instead act as obstacles; growing awareness and education around climate
change and social justice issues due to social media means a collective
shift in mindset regarding politics and economics is already
growing]{.mark} (e.g. use-value over exchange-value is the premise of
'opportunity' shops which have been growing in popularity) [and need
only be enhanced; concerns for ecosocialism's capacity to address
structural problems do not negate the massive progress that would be
realized via its implementation, and lastly, strategic deficiency can be
remedied if ecosocialists come together to formulate trajectories and
plans of action]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

3.1.1. Biodiversity

Biodiversity is a catchall phrase that refers to the lives of various
species. Replacing the terms 'species diversity' and 'species richness'
( Walker, 1992 ), biodiversity rose to prominence after the UN WCED1992
"Earth Summit" and is frequently specified by terrestrial, marine or
aquatic biodiversity. The [discourse of biodiversity]{.underline},
Escobar (2012)/(1995): 203) contends, [means 'nature becomes a source of
value in itself'.]{.underline} [The term biodiversity transforms species
of flora and fauna into 'reservoirs of value that research and
knowledge, along with biotechnology, can release for capital and
communities']{.underline} ( Escobar, 2012 : 203). In line with the creed
of sustainable development, [biodiversity is a categorical priming
for]{.underline} the [objectification of nature. The 'programmes, or
international meetings of donors and policymakers to discuss the fate of
'the global environment]{.underline},'" Sullivan (2006) (109) explains:

thus [requires and reproduces acceptable conceptualisations of, and
relationships with]{.underline}, the [presentable, packageable,
consumable and manageable objects of 'nature']{.underline},
['biodiversity' or 'the environment'.]{.underline} [A 'nature' with
which human relationships are reduced to sustainable consumption and
custodial practices]{.underline}, [whether direct or
indirect]{.underline}, [for]{.underline} [livelihoods or]{.underline}
for [profit]{.underline}.

The United Nations have been [instrumental]{.underline} in this
[commodification]{.underline} process. The 2005 United Nations
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report, is one of many examples, which
[conceptualizes nonhuman natures as 'ecosystem services']{.underline}
and offers twenty-four 'service categories', [such as]{.underline}
provisioning services ([food]{.underline}, [water, timber, fiber,
etc]{.underline}.), [regulating]{.underline} services ([floods,
droughts, land degradation and disease]{.underline}) [and so
on]{.underline} ( Sullivan, 2010 ). This [conceptualization of nature as
a service provider]{.underline}, in the words of Sullivan (2010) (116),
'[begins the discursive and conceptual transformation of earth into a
corporation, providing goods and services that can be quantified, priced
and traded as commodities']{.underline}. This [discursive and conceptual
transformation]{.underline}, however, [is not innocent]{.underline}.

[War is literally carried out by militarizing and employing
counterinsurgency to enforce conservation sites]{.underline} ( Verweijen
and Marijnen, 2018 : Marijnen et al., 2021 ), [and discursively by
capturing, enclosing, marketizing and financializing nature]{.underline}
[in the name of biodiversity, ecosystems and climate change
mitigation]{.underline} ( Dunlap and Fairhead, 2014 , Mirumachi et al.,
2020 ). ['"\[B\]iodiversity conservation" and]{.underline} other
["natural climate solutions"']{.underline}, Philippe Le Billon (2021)
(186), demonstrates, '[represent dangerous tools of land reallocation,
creating spaces of exception and annihilating "traditional"
socio-environmental forms of life'.]{.underline} Le Billion (2021)
reviews how [conservation and extractive industries are advancing
multiple forms of extraction]{.underline} (see Fig. 3 ), demonstrating
how '[biodiversity offsets]{.underline} can [pave the way to opening up
new spaces of coal extraction' as well as 'offer the agro-industrial
group opportunities to further coerce local communities into limiting
their traditional livelihood actives and]{.underline} possibly [evict
them from their ancestral territories']{.underline} (see also Brock,
2020 a; Huff and Orengo, 2021 ; Kröger, 2022 ). [The green economy,
through the framing of biodiversity]{.underline} (and carbon), [is
advancing ecological extraction and political control]{.underline}.

\[Figure Omitted\]

The trend of '[selling nature to save it']{.underline} ( McAfee, 1999 ),
resonates with the rise of 'neoliberal multiculturalism', that Hale
(2002) (498) describes as [redirecting]{.underline} 'the [abundant
political energy of cultural rights activism, rather than directly
oppose it']{.underline} (see also Ulloa, 2013 /2005). This is the
objective of ('soft') counterinsurgency strategies. Escobar, following
Martin O′Conner, foreshadows neoliberal multiculturalism and nature with
the concept of Biodiversity. "\[T\]he [tropical rain forest]{.underline}
areas of the world," Escobar (2012) (123) explains, '[are finally being
recognized as owners of their territories]{.underline} (or what is left
of them), [but only to the extent that they accept to treat it-and
themselves-as reservoirs of capital']{.underline}. [Forests and habitat
are ontologically flattened and reduced to investment
'resources']{.underline} ( Sullivan, 2010 , Sullivan, 2017 ), [ushering
in new waves of socio-ecological colonization]{.underline}. [The green
economy extends the trajectory of techno-capitalist
progress]{.underline}, even though it provides numerous benefits, which
makes this a subject of intense debate ( Dunlap and Sullivan, 2020 ,
Büscher and Fletcher, 2020 ; Kashwan et al., 2021 ; Huff, 2021 ). [The
green economy thereby serves as a method of pacification and ecological
conquest, advancing spatial control, creating markets, affirming statist
governance and expanding digitalization]{.underline} (dependent on
extractivism), [via financial apps, security equipment]{.underline} (for
park guards) [or surveillance and animal monitoring technologies, and
all in the name of environmental policy]{.underline}.

[Interstate conflicts over]{.underline} world [hegemony have marked the
transitions between Systemic Cycles of Accumulation]{.underline} (SCA)
[composed of stages of emergence, consolidation, and decline of
hegemonic states]{.underline} in the world system (Arrighi 1994). In the
first stage, [productive and material expansion is combined with growing
political and technological leadership that results in greater control
of innovations and geopolitical changes. In the stage of decline and
crisis, the Hegemon loses competitive leadership due to the
financialization of its economic surplus and appearance of other
competitors.]{.underline}

[Capitalism's logic of competition leads large corporations to transcend
national spaces to find resources, markets, and an abundant and cheap
labor force.]{.underline} [States support]{.underline} their
[corporations']{.underline} interests [by building military arsenals
and]{.underline} negotiating with and [putting pressure on other
countries. Competition between capitals can lead to competition between
rival states]{.underline} to delimit the rules of the international
system and the place occupied by each country in the international
division of labor. [This competition sometimes leads to war]{.underline}
and produces changes in the command of world hegemony, leading to new
SCA.

The [reorganization]{.underline} of the world [that took place between
1980 and the 2008 crisis under US hegemony turned East Asia into a
center of global capital accumulation with China at its center. In the
1980s and 1990s, US corporations restructured the economy to
reestablish]{.underline} their [domination over Japan and
German]{.underline}y, the two rival states of the time. The United
States played a major role in assimilating many of the former Soviet
Socialist Republics into the world order. [The United States' core
strategy for hegemony was based on integrating its former and potential
competitors into a global order under its domain]{.underline} (Smith
2016). [This strategy was successful until the rise of China, which
represents a systemic threat to the American model]{.underline} of
civilization and refuses to be integrated as a minor partner in the
current world order.

Many analysts argue that [the 2008 crisis and]{.underline} the
stagnation and partial [reversal of]{.underline} the [globalization
process is an outcome of how the accumulation crisis of the 1970s was
resolved, expressing the limits of US hegemony.]{.underline} Many
analysts even argue that [in recent years the world has gone from a
unipolar order]{.underline} with the United States in the center to a
bipolar order with China sharing the status of supreme power (Xuetong
2011).

The United States has been maintaining a structural trade and current
account deficit since 1974, with China making up the largest part of
that deficit. In 2018, 82% of US total current account deficit came from
a bilateral deficit with China, which has been reducing its holdings of
US debt but is still the largest American debt holder with \$1.12
trillion (BEA). Therefore, many authors speak of a strategic partnership
between the two countries, which allows the former to sell their goods
and the latter to artificially sustain its level of consumption through
access to cheaper goods and public and private indebtedness (Arceo
2018).

[The main hypothesis]{.underline} according [to which an armed conflict
would not erupt is that, unlike many other hegemonic disputes, the
Chinese and American economies are highly integrated.]{.underline} Since
the end of World War II, economic integration has served as a mechanism
to reduce the likelihood of conflict between countries. [When
competition prevails between economic actors of two opposing powers, the
objective conditions bring them to try to annihilate each
other.]{.underline} When there are commercial and financial partnerships
between actors from different countries, economic powers try to seek
peaceful solutions to the conflict. The coalition of interests between
corporations and states would prevent the destruction of capital that
would result in the case of an armed conflict.

Productive and [financial integration]{.underline} [between the United
States and China has shaped the form of capital accumulation since the
1980s.]{.underline} Foreign capital has been invited to enter the
Chinese economy as a subordinate actor and virtually all large
multinational companies have developed global value chains and become
tied to Chinese interests. The fragmentation and relocation of
production, the configuration of global value chains, and the
consolidation of the dollar as a reserve of global value and China as
the world's leading creditor configured a win-win relationship. Thanks
to those relationships and certain strategic policies, China has made
progress in high-tech industries and begun to catch-up with US
technological prowess. This articulation allowed China to maintain some
geopolitical autonomy from American interests and rise as a 'Contender
State' (Fusaro 2017).

However, the [limits to this strategic partnership have been showing for
years and economic interdependence between China and the United States
is being reversed in a movement that some analysts characterize as 'the
great decoupling']{.underline} (Actis & Creus 2019; Bremmer & Kupchan
2020). As a sign of this decoupling process, [we see the interruption of
the development of production chains and the dismantling of global value
chains, a decrease in R&D cooperation and the flow of academic and
technological exchanges, and a decrease in the level of bilateral
investments. The United States fears losing its economic and military
hegemony and China is preparing to autonomize its development process.
The 'great decoupling' process could]{.underline} slowly [reverse the
integration between the two countries and increase the likelihood of
conflict.]{.underline}3 However, the size of the Chinese domestic market
and the advantages of efficiency in supply chains limit the shift of
some manufacturing activities out of the country (Orr 2018).

[China's rise increased competition and tension with the United States
because China is not content to participate in the world order as a
minor partner.]{.underline} The [Thucydides trap refers to the pattern
of structural stress that results when a rising power challenges a
ruling one. In the past 500 years, there have been 16 occasions in which
a rising power threatened to displace the consolidated power and 12 of
those ended with war.]{.underline} There were only four occasions that
did not end in war: Spain against Portugal in the 15th century, the
United States against the United Kingdom at the beginning of the 20th
century, the USSR against the United States throughout the 20th century,
and Germany and Japan against the United States in the late 20th century
(Allison 2017). Of these experiences, the dispute between the United
States and the USSR was probably the one that compares the most to the
current hegemonic dispute. Many analysts are already calling the great
decoupling a 'new cold war' (Roubini 2020; Smith 2018).

The [Arctic is especially affected by]{.underline} the [cascading
impacts of]{.underline} the [climate catastrophe,]{.underline} with [its
climate warming four times faster in comparison to other
regions]{.underline} (Herrmann, 2015; IPCC, 2019). The climate crisis
and its purported solutions currently play an increasing role in shaping
Arctic life. [Climate change is creating]{.underline} a [discourse and
actions leading to]{.underline} the expansion of [green
extractivism]{.underline} across the region. While risks are increasing,
the [Arctic is paradoxically perceived by]{.underline} many domestic and
transnational [companies as a central point for]{.underline} so-called
[new green energy solutions and mining of transition
minerals]{.underline} (Duxbury, 2021; Hanaček et al., 2022; Len, 2021).
For example, western Greenland, where coastal glaciers have been
melting, has been a target of new mining ventures seeking to offer
minerals for the electrification of energy (Gronholt-Pedersen, 2022).
While [the climate crisis has been caused mostly by colonial actions and
extractivist frontier expansion by]{.underline} the [elites and
corporations of the core areas of the capitalist
world-ecology]{.underline} (Moore, 2016), [the Arctic suffers
excessively, and is]{.underline} furthermore [cast as a \"sacrifice
zone\" for extracting minerals and energy for supposed climate change
solutions]{.underline} (Össbo, 2023). The [crisis of the capitalist
world-ecology, meaning a rush to dwindling natural resources, is fueling
a desire to expand extractivist activities in the Arctic, creating a
complex and perilous feedback loop, as Arctic extractivism]{.underline}
can [directly drive]{.underline} the [breaching of global climate
tipping points]{.underline} (Kröger, 2023). For example, [flaring and
increased atmospheric soot and dust from mining cause quicker melting
and make ice sheets less reflective]{.underline}. An extractive push has
increased in some parts of the region alongside worsening socio-climatic
crises (Kröger, 2016a, 2018).

The [Arctic remains a prime target for extractivism, notably for
obtaining]{.underline} the [commodities to produce \"green\" or
low-carbon infrastructures instrumental in climate change mitigation
policies]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2023). Moreover, the attack on Ukraine
by Russia in February 2022, and the subsequent rush for alternative
energy and raw material sources especially in the European Union, has
led to major new expansion pushes, also in the Arctic (Kopra & Wall,
2022). The sanctions against Russia, and the worsening
climatic-ecological conditions for extraction due to collapsing
permafrost for example, have brought difficulties for the sector in some
parts of Arctic Russia (Kröger, 2023). [Visible resource conflicts and
resistance movements are]{.underline} thus [just the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to local grievances due to environmental, cultural, and
livelihood losses experienced by many Arctic peoples]{.underline}
(Heininen et al., 2022). This is a topic that can be explored more
deeply through the intertwined concepts of extractivism and colonialism,
which examine the structural, historical level where extractivist
hegemonies have been created for the Arctic.

Extractivism describes those activities that violently remove or extract
large quantities of natural resources, causing major social and
ecological damage (Acosta, 2011). The type, character and degree of
extractivism vary depending on the sector, style of extraction, and
context (Kröger, 2022). According to Gudynas (2021), extractivisms -- in
the plural, as there are many forms, such as [mining, fossil fuels,
commercial agriculture and forestry]{.underline} -- [entail breaking
down existing local economies and their ecological relationships, with
extracted products profiting national or international business classes
or governments. Extractivisms]{.underline}, however, [are not limited
to]{.underline} biophysical overexploitation and transformation of [the
environment]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011; Kröger et al., 2021; Svampa,
2019). [They are based on onto-epistemic violence]{.underline} against
Indigenous ways of relating to the Mother Earth (de la Cadena & Blaser,
2018). For example, replacing the latter with modernist assumptions and
ideas where nature is seen as external and available, \"free\" of people
or any constraints to exploit and appropriate in whatever manner, as
fast as wanted. Therefore, Durante et al. (2021: 20) refer to
[extractivisms]{.underline} as \"a [particular way of thinking and the
properties and practices organized towards the goal of maximizing
benefit through extraction]{.underline}, which brings in its wake
violence and destruction.\" Such forms of [colonialism and extractivism,
when part of capitalism, do not only mean imposing domination from
foreign countries and corporations. Colonialism]{.underline} can also be
[imposed and continuously sustained internally within a nation
state]{.underline} (Casanova, 1965; Churchill & LaDuke, 1992;
Maldonado-Torres, 2016). [Arctic extractivisms exist with several forms
of colonial relations]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022).

The concept of climate colonialism refers to how glaciers melting, sea
levels rising, and storms negatively affect those who have least
contributed to the climate crisis, such as Indigenous peoples, ethnic
minorities, and the impoverished (Landrum & Holland, 2020; Naykanchina,
2012). [Systems supporting colonialisms, such as patriarchy, racism,
Eurocentrism, and extractivism]{.underline} not only contribute to such
conditions, but also further [impose their own climate change
perspectives and \"solutions\"]{.underline} (Sheller, 2023). Climate
change is in part a result of colonial extractivism, and a greater
discussion of this connection in the literature has long been necessary
(Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Moore, 2016). For instance, [projected green
solutions and]{.underline} global [climate interventions reproduce
extractive understandings and dominant discourses, including viewing
climate as merely a biophysical problem to be remedied with
technologies, finance, and better economic modelling]{.underline}
(DeBoom, 2022; Sultana, 2022). [Apolitical approaches, with little to no
acknowledgment of global colonial histories,]{.underline} also [include
adaptation, vulnerability, and mitigation strategies that continue to
displace historically impoverished peoples from their land, disrupting
plural ways of life and knowledge]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012).
According to Gelderloos (2022) and Osborne & Carlson (2023), [industrial
expansion]{.underline} and present forms of pollution are [intrinsically
linked to the colonial state]{.underline}. The current [climate crisis
is the result of a state-corporate nexus]{.underline} responsible for
atmospheric change. However, the [mainstream crisis
solution]{.underline} to this nexus is [based on a carbon
reduction]{.underline} 2030 goal, [which is inherently linked to
existing fossil fuel and green extractivist initiatives]{.underline}
(ibid).

Put simply, both [green extractivism]{.underline} and the climate crisis
[perpetuate logics of colonialism and imperialism through negative
socio-environmental impacts, discursive (green) ignorance, climate
crisis denial, and attempts to create domination and hegemony by
extractivist forces]{.underline} -- [all these actions further driving
the climate catastrophe]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap & Riquito,
2023; Sultana, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). The term
[\"necrocene,\" or the new era of death and extinction on Earth, refers
to such denial and silencing of historical and present struggles against
socio-ecological breakdown]{.underline} (Batalla, 2020; Clark, 2021;
Mbembe, 2019). Therefore, the [poly-crisis]{.underline} including
climatic breakdowns [should be seen primarily as]{.underline} a
political [state and]{.underline} a [colonial condition]{.underline}
(Sheller, 2023). Combined, [green extractivism and climate
crises]{.underline} [form]{.underline} part of [ongoing
colonialities.]{.underline}

There is however resistance to extractivisms, challenging their
long-lasting systemic and environmental oppression (Acosta, 2011;
Escobar, 2011; Kröger, 2020; Scheidel et al., 2020; Svampa, 2016;
Willow, 2016). Environmental conflicts exist around the appropriation of
nature through efforts to preserve and protect ways of relating to
nature (Jerez et al., 2021). Connecting climate change and green
extractivism with acts of colonialism allows us to see how such
[constant invasion of territory, exploitation, and industrial
infrastructure in the name of saving the planet fit into the larger
picture of oppression]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023).

2.1. The green economy, resistance & governmental fears

[Climate change mitigation practices have been increasingly identified
as triggers of conflict, exaggerating inequality and ecological
degradation]{.underline} ( Dalby, 2013 , Dalby, 2020 , Dunlap and
Fairhead, 2014 , Sovacool et al., 2015 , Hunsberger et al., 2017 , Work
et al., 2019 ). [Climate change 'mitigation and adaptation efforts can
produce and perpetuate spaces of danger']{.underline}, explains Naho
Mirumachi and colleagues (2020: 1) pointing out five aspects to assess
low-carbon development. [This includes 'spatially uneven effects of low
carbon development; violent imageries of the global south and the
production of "ungoverned spaces," demarcating spaces of
insecurity;]{.underline} non-violent yet harmful instances of conflict,
mediated through [political control; marginalization and dispossession
of groups]{.underline} within society; [and depoliticized,
techno-managerial effects of resilience that evade addressing sources of
contention]{.underline}' ( Mirumachi et al., 2020 : 2). [Predictably
structurally racist]{.underline} (see Patel, 2020), [sustainable
development and climate change mitigation projects are recognized as
significant threats to environments and the peoples that inhabit

There is a growing literature recognizing the increasingly harmful
effects of sustainable development ( Menton et al., 2021 ; Temper et

#### Exploration and development of the Arctic colonizes the Circumpolar North periphery -- the aff creates new commodity frontiers and resource extraction

**Hanaček et al** Researcher at the Institute of Environmental Science
and Technology, Autonomous University of Barcelona **24**

\[Ksenija Hanaček -. "Green and climate colonialities: Evidence from
Arctic Extractivisms." *Journal of Political Ecology*, Vol. 34, Issue 1,
2024, https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.5512, July 19th, 2025, HDCSW- JW\]

The Arctic is typically assumed to be situated geographically in the
"Global North". However, our results on the Arctic commodity frontiers
suggest that crisp Global South-North divides are hard to support
analytically. The [increased resource extraction in the
Arctic]{.underline} region [suggests]{.underline} rather the claim [that
commodity frontiers move globally, leading to the peripheralization and
damaging of regions around the world. There are many pockets now in the
Arctic]{.underline} and other parts of the assumed "Global North" [that
increasingly fulfil the role of supplier of raw materials at cheap
prices but with a heavy socio-environmental cost. These processes
sustain hegemonic or partially colonial relations between core economic
states (e.g. US, Russia, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden) and the
Circumpolar North 'periphery'-- home to local communities and Indigenous
groups]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012; Muller-Wille, 1987).

In fact, this has been the case already for long, as the [Arctic
Indigenous populations]{.underline} whose [sovereignty and territories
have been violated]{.underline} have witnessed. [The Arctic has been a
colonized territory and remains]{.underline} partly [colonized through
the expansion of new commodity frontiers. It supplies land for new
transport infrastructure (ports and pipelines), fossil fuels and metals
(iron ores, nickel, copper, and gold) across all
territories.]{.underline} Thus, beyond the South-North distinction, this
article shows how historical trajectories of resource extraction, and
the current expansion of commodity frontiers manifest themselves in
peripheral regions beyond North-South divides. Environmental conflicts
arise in both the Global South and the "South in the North".

One can regard the Arctic as a semi-colonial resource and commodity
frontier (Egerman et al., 2003; Körber et al., 2017), where the areas
with ethno-territorial rights present pockets of autonomy, while the
many cases of [expanding extractivisms are colonial]{.underline}-type
[violations of local people\'s rights]{.underline}. Accordingly, the
geography and the changing climate in the Arctic present important
considerations in this resource frontier (like permafrost melting and
new sea routes) in the longue durée of the region, moving to a greater
extractivist push amid increasing uncertainties and risks (Kröger,
2022). [This process is already evidenced by the number of extractive
commodity projects and significant socio-environmental consequences
suffered by local communities who complain accordingly about their
impact]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [increasing carbon dioxide from]{.underline} the burning
[of fossil fuels]{.underline} contributes to rising greenhouse gases
that [are melting the sea ice]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} also
[allows]{.underline} for [greater resource extraction,]{.underline}
consequently [leading to further sea ice melting, with strong negative
impacts on local, global and Arctic environments]{.underline} (Kröger,
2016). In this sense, [oil and gas, mining and the shipping industries
are the biggest drivers and possible beneficiaries of the Arctic ice
melt. To see the Arctic as a resource extraction frontier is not
new.]{.underline} The term 'extractivism' from Latin American political
ecology (Svampa, 2019) has already been used in studies of Arctic
environmental conflicts.

A special issue on the Arctic in the journal Extractive Industries and
Society (Wilson and Stammler, 2016) focused on whether costs and
benefits are shared in such a way that current extractive projects
obtain a so-called social license to operate (SLO), meaning approval or
acquiescence to the investments. However, this article does not aim to
give advice to private or public companies on how to exercise Corporate
Social Responsibility or to achieve so-called SLO while increasing their
business. In contrast, we put socio-environmental injustices ocurring in
the region into a more systematic and historical perspective, which
shows that [the Arctic has been, and is becoming more and more, a
commodity extraction frontier, a commodity transport frontier, and, to
some extent, a waste disposal frontier. The ecological distribution
conflicts arising at these frontiers contest the associated negative
socio-environmental impacts,]{.underline} and in the case of the Arctic,
have contributed to the cancellation of damaging projects in about 20%
of cases. Thus, effective resistance at the frontlines of extractivism
can lead to a social transition towards the reaffirmation of Indigenous
sovereignty (Temper et al., 2020) and towards a more sustainable and
just economy (Scheidel et al., 2018; Temper et al., 2018).

In essence, frontiers can be merely resource frontiers (prior to any
large scale trade), commodity frontiers for trade purposes (Moore,
2000), or a combination of both (Kröger and Nygren, 2020). Commodity
frontiers are based on two interrelated processes. Namely, commodity
widening, such as through the expansion and occupation of lands destined
to extraction (e.g. in the Arctic region), and commodity deepening,
which involves intensification of existing commodity production through
socio-technical innovation (e.g. nickel mining, oil drilling, new
infrastructure) (Banoub et al., 2020). [Commodity frontiers have
inherently extractive and exploitative characteristics]{.underline}
(Moore, 2000), [which often involve environmental injustice,
inequalities, and degradations at the expense of both Indigenous and
non-Indigenous peoples]{.underline} (Beckert et al., 2021;
Martinez-Alier, 2002). Another important characteristic that frontiers
have frequently in common is the resistance of people to injustice,
inequality, and degradation (Conde, 2017; Temper et al., 2015;
Schneider, 2020). However, mobilization and resistance are not present
across all the cases of frontier expansions, but these depend on the
fostering of contentious agency by particular would-be resistance
actors, typically local communities, there being a wide variety of local
responses to extractivist expansions (Kröger, 2020).

[In]{.underline} the specific case of [the Arctic]{.underline} region,
[frontier occupation and extractivism on commons and Indigenous lands
are not new]{.underline} (Muller-Wille, 1987; Stuhl, 2016). The [Arctic
resource frontier came into existence in the sixteen century through the
colonial geography of the West, mainly via]{.underline} the [Nordic
countries]{.underline}, [other major countries in the West, and Russia,
all of which were subsequently motivated by large-scale and intensive
industrial extraction for trade and profit]{.underline} (Avango et al.,
2014). For instance, the Dutch and the British established whaling
stations and coal extraction processes on Svalbard in 1610; the Ivigtut
cryolite deposit extraction began in Greenland in 1854; the 1898
Klondike gold rush occurred between Skagway, Alaska and Yukon in Canada
(Boyd et al., 2015), among others.

[What is new to the current wave of frontier expansion,]{.underline}
however, [is]{.underline} the [increased rapidity and volume of
extraction occurring in the region]{.underline} (Kröger, 2019). [Climate
change is facilitating access to]{.underline} some [resources in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Landrum and Holland, 2020; Saebi et al., 2020),
while [changing political and economic agendas are attempting to
legitimize new pathways towards extraction, thereby creating destructive
attitudes to the environment and to Arctic peoples]{.underline}
(Bennett, 2016; Huntington, 2016). [Such agendas are generally applied
without]{.underline} the [full consultation and participation of the
affected people]{.underline}, especially Indigenous groups (Cameron,
2012). Thus, [the present wave of Arctic extractivism continues to
maintain patterns of the colonial 'past']{.underline} (Escobar, 2008;
Körber et al., 2017; Stuhl, 2016). However, [for many Arctic people, the
land is not a commodity which can just be acquired at will, but an
important element for interrelated and interdependent environmental and
socio-cultural well-being]{.underline} (Nuttall, 1998; The Arctic
Council, 2015a).

[The effect of this resource depletion is a threat to]{.underline} the
[continuation of Indigenous traditions, identities, and human-nature
relationships when large-scale extraction occupies their
lands]{.underline} (Naykanchina, 2012; Coombes et al., 2012; Lassila,
2020). This [extraction and exploitation]{.underline} has [pushed local
communities]{.underline} in the Arctic and their traditional system of
beliefs [to the margin]{.underline} (Bennett, 2016). Yet, the [benefits
of extractive economies are meant for a few local actors or distant
foreigner investors]{.underline} (Moore, 2018[), while the cost of
extractive economies are imposed upon Indigenous people,]{.underline}
pastoralists and fishermen (Cameron, 2012; Dwyer and Istomin, 2009).

To maintain political and economic control of the Arctic (Muller-Wille,
1987), two contradictory trends can be seen in the global resource
politics of the region (Naykanchina, 2012, p.20). Namely, [a vast
increase in extractive activities and infrastructure projects on
traditional Indigenous lands undermine the recognition of Indigenous
territorial rights and traditional land-use]{.underline}, such as
reindeer herding, hunting and fishing (Herrmann et al., 2014; Herrmann
and Heinämäki, 2017; Naykanchina, 2012). Therefore, [common lands and
traditional ways of life in the Arctic are being rapidly replaced by
metal mining, fossil fuel extraction, wind-power parks, transport
infrastructure and hydropower projects]{.underline} (Naykanchina, 2012).
Consequently, the [high levels of industrialized extraction and
utilization of resources are causing often irreversible
socio-environmental damage. This is giving rise to intense
socio-environmental conflict in the region]{.underline} (Ahtuangaruak,
2018; Keil, 2014; Nuttall, 2013; Nuttall, 1998).

As research connects the global cryosphere to debates about the
Anthropocene, the affordances provided by Arctic and Antarctic ice
became increasingly recognised and celebrated as integral to seasonal
regularity, shaping the wider benefit to the earth\'s (human)
inhabitants that have come to depend upon it since the Little Ice Age.
[As scholars of ice have noted, the last 150 years have been
extraordinarily dependent on relationships and entanglements with
artificial and natural frozen water]{.underline} (Dodds,
[[2018]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0024);
Heidbrink,
[[2020]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0035)).
In the nineteenth century [a global ice trade flourished involving the
extraction and transportation of Arctic glacial, river and lake ice that
connected,]{.underline} for example, Alaska to California and Norway to
the United Kingdom. [These global movements also demonstrate the role of
ice in fulfilling the need of certain racialised bodies to 'keep cool'
in tropical geographies, which signals and shapes oppressive interfaces
between colonial actors and Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, between the
metropole and the colony (Hobart,
[[2022]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0038)).
In this way, [ice can act as]{.underline} both a [deterrent to movements
of empire and colonialism in the Arctic and Antarctic]{.underline} while
also demonstrating aesthetics of colonial comfort of ice as a comestible
transported from the hinterlands. If tropical heat is disorienting, and
ice a mediating factor in providing stability and comfort for temperate
bodies and agents of colonialism, here ice can be understood as a
buffer, something that George Orwell reflected upon in his ruminations
about life in colonial Burma, entitled *Burmese Days* (Orwell,
[[1934]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0049)).

In the twentieth century, [scientific interest in the Arctic, especially
the island of Greenland, grew markedly]{.underline} as climate research
began to shift its attention away from natural variability towards the
perturbative role of human agency. [The Arctic proved itself to be
strategically significant to colonial-capitalist militaristic endeavours
and initiatives during World War II]{.underline} and the appropriately
named Cold War. [What connects the three developments is the role and
value of ice: as commodity, as locatable and portable scientific object,
as substance that challenged conventional military tactics and domain
awareness]{.underline}. Simultaneously, civil-military resourcing could
also enable the material presence of scientific stations dedicated to
ice coring and ice surveying in the Arctic and Antarctic. Domain
awareness was not restricted to land, sea and air. Going 'underground'
had its advantages; [scientists were eager to discover more about what
lay underneath ice sheets and glaciers while militaries experimented
with plans to hide infrastructure including missile installations under
those same ice bodies.]{.underline} [The toxic remains of such military
projects and plans are easily found across Arctic spaces.]{.underline}
As the ice harvester, the scientist and the soldier/naval officer
quickly discovered what Indigenous people have already long known and
experienced, ice is highly dynamic, shape-shifting and capable of
frustrating, blocking and resisting human designs. As Michael Bravo has
alerted us, there is a cryo-politics to all of this (Bravo,
[[2017]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0010)).

[In this moment of late modernity, however, the Arctic now comes to
matter differently on the main stage and through the main
stream]{.underline}. Now, scholars, scientists, activists and
journalists report that there is too little ice, too much glacial
retreat, and insufficient frozen terrain (Balog,
[[2012]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0006)).
[Ice is no longer performing as a reliable buffer---containing
subsurface carbon stores, reflecting heat, and preserving the frigidity
of polar waters. Nor is ice performing as a constant or consistent
barrier. Whereas earlier dominant refrains regarding the Arctic
discussed it as an obstacle, if anything useful to comment upon at all,
now Arctic ice as it drastically transforms shape and viscosity receives
more press than ever]{.underline}. If the Arctic was largely ignored and
overlooked in previous eras of the Western master narrative, [in
dominant discourse now, the Arctic in part constitutes what it means to
be a human being in a moment of late-stage capitalism.]{.underline} As

report, glacial funerals are now being held in Iceland as a way of
marking disappearance and persistent sea ice loss is credited as
ushering into existence a 'new Arctic' (on the 'new Arctic', see
Serreze,
[[2018]{.underline}](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geoj.12481#geoj12481-bib-0054)).

suggest that the public mourning of glacial disappearance operates as an
opportunity to think of ice as animate rather than inanimate, an idea
similar to Cruickshank\'s detailing of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Eyak
philosophies pertaining to glacial sentience, and the long held belief
that glaciers are social actors that change physical, social and
spiritual landscapes. This is a loss that cannot be adequately captured
by metrics such as ice melt and surface area exposure but something that
speaks to the connections between ice and the life-worlds of others. In
her account of life on either side of the Bering Strait, Bathsheba
Demuth reminds us of how sea ice is lively, animate and life-affirming.
As she notes:

In forming, thawing and shifting under the wind, ice steadies the
circulation of the world\'s oceans, making them hospitable for living
things ... The sea ice shapes being, human and otherwise, on this
planet. From its groaning surface, the world as we know it is made

The biodiversity turn is predicated on 'natural resource', but also
cognitive resources. Speaking to Escobar (2012) , Hale (2002) and Ulloa
(2013) , Leanne Betasamosake Simpson commiserates:

[When there was a push to bring traditional knowledge into environmental
thinking]{.underline} after Our Common Future in the late 1980 s, [it
was a very extractivist approach: "Let's take whatever teachings you
might have that would help us right out of your context, right away from
your knowledge holders, right out of your language, and integrate them
into this assimilatory mindset]{.underline}." [It's the idea that
traditional knowledge and indigenous peoples have some sort of secret of
how to live on the land in a non-exploitive way that broader society
needs to appropriate]{.underline}. But [the extractivist mindset isn't
about having a conversation and having a dialogue and bringing in
indigenous knowledge on the terms of indigenous peoples. It is very much
about extracting whatever ideas scientists or environmentalists thought
were good and assimilating it]{.underline}.... put it onto toilet paper
[and sell it]{.underline} to people. [There's an intellectual
extraction, a cognitive extraction]{.underline}, as well as a physical
one. ( Klein & L. Simpson, 2012 ).

[Land, biodiversity and knowledge are]{.underline} the [primary

[Sustainable development, or "greening," assimilates traditional

The frontier is a contact zone. It is the sites of encounters between
knowledge practices, jurisdictions, and visions of modernity,
development, and progress. This becomes particularly acute when ''the
[meaning of place"]{.underline} has [become]{.underline} an
[important]{.underline} object of [struggle between central states and
subaltern]{.underline} [and first peoples]{.underline} (Escobar, 2001).
These modes of claiming space related to the frontier [rest
on]{.underline} notions of a [Euro-American separation between nature
and culture]{.underline} (see Descola & Pa´lsson, 1996; Ingold, 2000;
Latour, 2012). They also [occur in particular places inhabited by
particular peoples]{.underline}. Thus, by semantic legerdemain
underpinned by force, [original inhabitants of frontier
zones]{.underline} have often been [classified as less than legal
subjects]{.underline}, [with little capacity to have
rights]{.underline}. They have been [defined as primitive and
backward]{.underline}, and their rules for accessing resources
irrational and wasteful. People have thereby been [robbed of a legal and
political identity]{.underline} that enjoys parity with the rest of the
population---especially the incoming groups.

Dispossessing and disenfranchising original inhabitants by annulling the
previous social contract have not always entailed their total exclusion
from society, however. [Indigenous groups]{.underline}---or others who
have been downgraded and whose rights have been clipped---[have been
integrated into]{.underline} the [economy on unequal and highly
disadvantageous terms as labor]{.underline}. The dispossessed commoners
during England's industrial revolution come to mind (Neeson, 1993), but
more recent examples abound. The homelands in apartheid South Africa
were labor reserves deliberately made up of dispossessed and relocated
Africans (Mamdani, 1996). The people labeled ''communists" in the 1960s
and 1970s in New Order Indonesia were used as forced labor in
plantations on land ''freed up" by their own dispossession (Lucas &
Warren, 2013). And on the West Bank, former landowners and their
descendants have become migrant labor in Israel (Weizman, 2007). Peru's
President Agusto Leguı´a (1919--30) began the registration of ''Indian
communities" as a token of their existence as (limited) rights subjects.
However, in 1920, the president issued a decree that conscripted all
able-bodied ''Indians" between the age of 18 and 60 for road work. The
Ley de Conscripcio´ n Vial therefore extracted labor from the highland
communities with effects on local-level power relations (Drinot, 2011).
Such [regimes of forced labor were constitutive of
citizenship]{.underline} [in]{.underline} a [direct exchange
between]{.underline} the [central government and highland
communities]{.underline} (Wilson, 2004). Simultaneously, the rubber
barons of the Amazon created abusive extractive regimes, violently
stripping local populations of their rights as detailed by Casement in
the Putumayo Region (see Chirif & Chaparro, 2009; Taussig, 1987).

Within the current political conjuncture of rural dispossession,
however, the [creation of]{.underline} so-called ''[surplus
population]{.underline}" (Li, 2010, 2014) [occurs]{.underline} where
places [and]{.underline} their [resources]{.underline} are [deemed
useful]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} who
dwell [therein are not.]{.underline} The [dispossession of land and
livelihoods therefore becomes detached from any prospect of labor
absorption]{.underline}. This underscores how the [frontier]{.underline}
[dynamics]{.underline} [work]{.underline} not only [by zeroing out
existing orders and erasing]{.underline} the [traces of past
livelihoods]{.underline}, but [also]{.underline}, sometimes, by
[excluding]{.underline} the [dispossessed from]{.underline} the [new
order of things]{.underline}. As resources are discovered and exploited,
people are rendered of no use and their lives and life-worlds of no
value. As Duncan puts it,

> [\[c\]lassifying]{.underline} [minorities as primitives]{.underline}
> helps [strip]{.underline} [them of political identity and discourages
> them from participation]{.underline} on larger state projects. Hence,
> governments actively use the pejorative labels to [exclude and deny
> autonomy to indigenous minorities at]{.underline} the
> [same]{.underline} [time]{.underline} that [they can claim to be

> these groups as a hindrance to national progress or a threat to
> national security,]{.underline} these [programs]{.underline} also
> [serve larger goals of nationbuilding.]{.underline} \[Duncan, 2004, p.
> 1\]

In short, while concrete government administration is patchy in frontier
zones, a fundamental legal and discursive operation has often been quite
thoroughly undertaken. [Local landscapes]{.underline} have been [turned
into unworked nature]{.underline}, which consequently is no one's
property. Even if land was to be owned, [customary laws of
tenure]{.underline} have been [dismissed as inferior]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [local populations]{.underline} have been
[denied]{.underline} the [right to have rights as sub-legal
subjects]{.underline}. In his work on the Brazilian Amazon, Campbell
(2015) describes how [settlers in large numbers took possession
of]{.underline} the land in the [Amazonian frontier]{.underline}. Then,
after possession was accomplished, the frontiersmen [conjured up
documents and other ''proofs" that could be read and understood by
government]{.underline}. In the process, they [consolidated their
spatial control]{.underline}, and [dismissed]{.underline} the [previous
occupants as useless]{.underline}. In a crass quote from a homesteader
we hear an echo of Locke, as he argues: ''I ask you: what's better for
the Republic, for the common good, productive farms or naked and
starving Indians?" (Campbell, 2015, p. 110). The [settlers' occupation
of]{.underline} the [land preceded their legitimated and recognized
property rights.]{.underline} And, equally, the authority of the
Brazilian government was conjured up by the settlement as the settlers
invoked the state in all their fake deeds and fabricated documents. The
[state]{.underline} was [present as a legitimating reference point long
before any government agent had set foot at]{.underline} the
[frontier]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- integrate indigenous people link

#### Political recognition of people linked to institution\'s cartographic strategies for creating new frontier -- linking identity to \"inherent\" qualities justifies progress as displacement of people 

**RASMUSSEN**, Associate Professor @ UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, **and
LUND**, PhD in International Development Studies, **2017**

\[MATTIAS BORG and CHRISTIAN, "Reconfiguring Frontier Spaces:
Territorialization and Resource Control," World Development, Vol. 101,

Political authority, citizenship, and property. Central to our concern
is the [link between territoriality]{.underline}, as an effort [to
control people]{.underline} [and resources]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the exercise of [authority]{.underline} (Lund, 2006;
Sikor & Lund, 2009; Ribot & Peluso, 2003). The territorial
administration deals with two fundamental questions: who are the rights
subjects in a given space, and what rights do they enjoy? These are
fundamental questions of citizenship and property. And while an
authority recognizes these rights, the [recognition is mutual and
recursive]{.underline}. This means that [when people lodge their
claims]{.underline} the [authorizing institution's authority is equally
recognized in]{.underline} the [process]{.underline}. ''These
[are]{.underline} the ''[contracts]{.underline}", so to speak,
[that]{.underline} [link citizenship and property to political
authority]{.underline} in society. [Struggles over citizenship and
property are]{.underline}, therefore, as [much about]{.underline} the
[scope and constitution of authority as about access to membership and
resources]{.underline}" (Lund, 2011, p. 72). Thus, the ability to
territorialize does not derive from a pre-existing authority. Rather,
the successful territorializations of an extractive zone, a conservation
area, or a community forest are co-productive of authority. This goes
for the case of small-scale miners in West Kalimantan who have devised
rules and regulations that are not formal but nonetheless subject to
strict enforcement from emergent informal authorities, the so-called
tuan tanah (Peluso, this issue). Likewise, in highland Ecuador, the
ongoing struggles to secure the access point to the Quilotoa Crater
Lake---and thereby the revenues from the growing tourist industry---were
not resolved by the victory of a preexisting authority. Instead, as the
Tourist Cooperative consolidated its territorial claims, its authority
to decide on matters beyond tourism became manifest (Colloredo-Mansfeld
et al., this issue, see also Anderson & Hill, 2004).

[Political organizations]{.underline} in control of space often [try
to]{.underline} place or [relocate people]{.underline}. Enclosure,
eviction, and resettlement are all instruments employed to secure
spatial control (Grandia, 2012; Thompson, 1963). As we discussed
previously, [physical and symbolic enclosures]{.underline} are
[also]{.underline} in themselves [strategies for creating new
frontiers]{.underline}, redefining institutions, and narrowing the
possibilities of meaningful political and social membership. Very often,
such categorizations have been ordered by powerful authorities---often
governments, but not exclusively so. By [linking]{.underline}
''principles" of race, ethnicity, or [other forms of identity to
''inherent qualities]{.underline}" such as ''ignorance", ''carelessness
about nature", or simply ''labor", [displacement]{.underline} [of people
has been justified as progress]{.underline}. The South African history
of apartheid is probably one of the most egregious instances of
territorialized and differentiated citizenship (Mamdani, 1996), but the
examples are legion. Transmigration programs in Indonesia to colonize
''underpopulated" areas, and policies of forced settlement of itinerant
upland farmers in most of South East Asia, are variations on a theme
(Hall, Hirsch, & Li, 2011). The [capacity to locate and dislocate
particular groups to and from spaces]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the
[basis of political identity is central to
territorialization]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [ability to
enforce]{.underline} [it]{.underline} [crucial]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} the [consolidation of political
authority]{.underline}. This is particularly evident in cases of
conservation such as the establishment of the Wildlife Management Areas
discussed by Bluwstein and Lund in this issue. The [displacement of
people and]{.underline} the [redefinition of proper land-use strategies
in]{.underline} the [name of nature preservation]{.underline} are
[legitimized by cartographic representations]{.underline}. These
represent different ways of perceiving the landscape: one external
through GIS, one internal by reference to landmarks such as rivers and
local territorial histories. Here, past boundaries inform current
territorial arrangements. Yet such techniques of territorial governance
can also be reworked by local communities.

In addition to defining and locating rights subjects,
[specifying]{.underline} their [rights]{.underline} is [crucial to
territorialization]{.underline}. Governing agencies engage in defining
and managing property rights and systems. [Colonial powers]{.underline},
and later post-colonial governments, have often [declared]{.underline}
[all land]{.underline} the ''[property of]{.underline} the
[state]{.underline}". They tolerated some continuation and reworking of
previous systems with the crucial caveat that those---now inferior---
rights could be set aside within the law. Territorializing agencies
could thereby [carve out concessions to particular
resources]{.underline}---plantations, mining, oil, nature reserves, et
cetera. These practices have often met with different forms of
resistance, and exclusive territorial rule is often upset by
criss-crossing jurisdictions. Territorial dynamics are [intimately
linked to]{.underline} the [underground ''map]{.underline}". In this
issue, Coˆte and Korf describe what they term the ''plurification" of
authority. In the context of a liberalization of the gold mining sector,
state and non-state authorities compete over legitimate authority to
govern. Gold miners navigate between these jurisdictions, which is
further complicated by the ways in which the overground is governed in
relation to the corresponding governance systems of forestry or farming.
Similar dynamics of multiple governing institutions are at play in the
Indonesian case discussed by Peluso (this issue). Here, ''Miners occupy
and transform the spaces of cities, densely occupied settlements,
resettlement villages, oil palm plantations, swamp and other lowland
forest, and rice and agroforestry fields that small farmers hold by
title and by custom". In each of these instances, the mining pits are
embedded in particular institutional contexts and miners strive to
establish and legitimate their right to extract. [Territorializing
political and legal subjects, and the rights to resources]{.underline},
takes a variety of forms, but [drawing boundaries and making
zones]{.underline} are [particularly efficient strategies]{.underline}.

#### The aff is [neotribal capitalism]{.underline} -- they facilitate new class relations through the ideologies of renewed kinship and colonial reconciliation -- the aff is not redress for oppression, but a reformulation of neoliberalism -- native [elites]{.underline} control the means of production through the organized corporate tribe 

**Rose,** SUNY Buffalo**, 2015**

(Samuel W, "Two thematic manifestations of neotribal capitalism in the
United States," Anthropological Theory, 2015, Vol 15, Sci-Hub HDCSW-JCP)

[Rata developed this concept of neotribal capitalism as a critical
framework for understanding]{.underline} the social, political, and
economic [transformations of the indigenous Maori communities in New
Zealand]{.underline} wherein [she describes the promotion of neotribal
capitalism by the emergent tribal elite in brokerage with the government
of New Zealand as a rhetorical means of **colonial
reconciliation**]{.underline}, [the creation of capitalist economic
structures by Maori peoples]{.underline}, class formation and the
emergence of a Maori elite, and the workings of neotraditionalist
ideology (Rata, 2000, 2003a, 2003b, 2004, 2005, 2011a, 2011b, 2013).
[This framework has since begun to be applied to understanding similar
policies and processes in **other settler-colonial states**]{.underline}
(Schroder, 2003; Rose, 2014). [Rata]{.underline} (2000: 33) [defines
neotribal capitalism clearly as 'the articulation of exploitative class
social relations of production and a neotraditionalist]{.underline}
[ideology of **revived communal relations** within a social formation
structured by a capitalist regime of accumulation]{.underline}'. She
(2000: 33) adds that: [Neotribal capitalism shares the fundamental
features of capitalism]{.underline}, such as exploitative class
relations, the commodity exchange relation and the accumulation of
capital. However, [a tribal mode of regulation establishes two specific
features that distinguish neotribal capitalism from other
versions]{.underline}. Firstly, neotribal capitalism is characterised by
the absence of privatized ownership of the means of production. [The
corporate tribe]{.underline}, rather than the individual, [**is the
legal owner of the lands, waters and knowledge.** Economic control of
tribal resources is located in the groups who use the resources for
commodity production]{.underline}. Secondly, [class relations of
production are reified as communal social relations within a
neotraditionalist ideology]{.underline}. She goes on to state that in
New Zealand, neotraditionalism has served two purposes: 'it shaped the
form of the global universalizing force of late capitalism into a local
version of capitalism through the dialectical interaction of the global
and the local, and secondly, it reified the exploitative class relations
of neotribal capitalism in the form of nonexploitative communal
relations of production' (Rata, 2000: 43). [**Neotribal capitalism** did
not emerge in opposition to indigenist movements, but rather represents
an accommodation to or '**political brokerage'**]{.underline} (Rata,
2004: 59) [with capitalism made by indigenous elites in the revivalist
movement]{.underline}. Rata (2000: 44) states that: [Neotraditionalist
ideology has emerged out of the processes of,]{.underline} firstly, [the
attempt to revive a traditional way of life in response to oppressive
material conditions]{.underline}, and secondly to establish a Maori
political identity as indigenous people in contrast to later arrivals to
New Zealand. Although the social relations of production of neotribal
capitalism are class relations, [the ideology of retribalisation assumes
a revival of communal relations of production based in the kin-group's
ownership of land]{.underline}. **[The new class relations are concealed
in the ideology of the revived kinship]{.underline}**. Likewise,
[despite the hegemonic quality that neotraditionalist ideology has in
many settler-colonial states]{.underline}, it should be understood that
[contemporary indigenous governments are not merely updated versions of
traditional political systems]{.underline}. As Rata (2004: 59) states:
**[The contemporary tribe]{.underline}** (the neotribe) **[is
fundamentally different from the traditional tribe]{.underline}**. [The
neotribe is an economic corporation with the class relations of any
capitalist organization.]{.underline} People relate to one another, and
to material and cultural resources, in fundamentally different ways from
the relationships that characterise redistributive traditional social
structures. This article focuses on applying this understanding of
neotraditionalist ideology to see how [similar ideologies are used in
the United States to obscure class relations, promote neotribal
governments as 'regimes of accumulation']{.underline} (Rata, 2000: 36),
**[and insulate neotribal governments and those processes of capital
accumulation from criticism.]{.underline}**

### 1nc -- tribal recognition 

#### Focus on the jurisdiction of indigenous groups renders the indigenous proletarian invisible \-- class as a category is constitutive of the position of Indigenous folk but the affs political approach to redress obfuscates the role of capital

**Libretti 01**

\[Tim Libretti, professor of English at Northeastern Illinois
University, "The Other Proletarians: Native American Literature and
Class Struggle," Modern Fiction Studies, Vol. 47, No. 1 (Spring 2001),
Published by Johns Hopkins University Press, Accessed 7-15-2025,
HDSCW-JX\]1

**[Studying Native American literature as proletarian both expands
traditional sociological and thematic contours of the genre and also
transforms its politics by rethinking and deepening the materialist
dialectic through an incorporation of the historical experiences of
work, exploitation, and colonization, as well as the class consciousness
of Native Americans who have rarely been studied or understood as part
of U.S. labor history.]{.underline}** In calling \"into question
standard representations that make wage labor invisible in the culture
histories of Native Americans,\" Patricia Albers has argued that
\"Native peoples are denied a place in most accounts of labor history in
the United States and, even when present, \[. . .\] are relegated to a
passive background position outside the flow of determinative economic
movements and events\" (246). Moreover, much of the so-called
\"authentic\" work of Native Americans, she points out, tends to be
perceptually isolated from other functionings of the economy and
dehistoricized, \"treated in legendary terms as part of a timeless,
sacred tradition and ancient lore, \[. . .\] situated in a popular play
of mythic images rather than in a progression of actual historic
events\" (248). [This isolation and invisibility of Native American
labor has also]{.underline} \[End Page 165\] [been furthered by a
narrow, even obsessive, focus on the land question as the overriding if
not sole economic concern of Native Americans.]{.underline} As Martha
Knack and Alice Littlefield admonish, Another cause of scholarly silence
about Indian labor has been the restrictive definition of Native
American economics as an issue of natural resources, specifically land.
Although the wholesale dispossession of land from the first Americans is
a dramatic, visible, and emotionally powerful issue, and one that has
great strategic importance to indigenous peoples in their claims for
political sovereignty and financial redress, it should not be allowed to
obscure another resource that Indians possessed and non-Indians came
gradually to control\--their labor. (4) [Understanding the proletarian
dimensions of the Native American experience]{.underline}, Knack and
Littlefield conclude, means that \"[perhaps we need to reconsider what
we mean by proletarian\"]{.underline} (28). [Rethinking the sociological
composition of the working class also entails reconceptualizing the
corpus of literary works that comprise the genre of proletarian
literature, a genre we must theorize as historical and fluid precisely
because it is linked to the historical category of the working class,
the contours and composition of which are constantly changing in
response to the processes of class formation and economic development.
Com**prehending the Native American working-class experience provides a
more complex understanding of not only the very concepts of class and
class formation in the United States, but more specifically of the role
of genocide and colonization in the formation and continuation of the
U.S. as a racial, patriarchal, and capitalist
nation-state.**]{.underline} Native Americans constitute a unique sector
of the U.S. working class, although, as noted above, they are not often
recognized as such. Accordingly, the literature highlights the specific
interests of [Native Americans]{.underline} [not only with regard to the
land question but, perhaps more importantly, with the desire for a
nonalienated labor and a disalienated relationship to the land, which is
implicit in, though not usually understood as part of, the desire for
and demand of a return of the land.]{.underline} Moreover, as Native
American writers such as Leslie Marmon Silko and Simon Ortiz script
master narratives of liberation responsive to the Native American
experience, \[End Page 166\] they are also mapping more complex master
narratives of class struggle and of liberation from global capitalism.
Understanding Native American literature as a working-class literature
engenders a more complex Marxism, one that is more comprehensive of and
responsive to the operations of U.S. capitalism in its imperialist and
internal colonial practices. The result is a proletarian literary
category that more accurately comprehends the multiple and varied
sectors of the U.S. working class and thus, by extension, a deepened,
more historical Marxism.

### 1nc -- tribal sovereignty link

#### **Their advocacy of tribal sovereignty [affirms]{.underline} neotribal power that silences criticism of tribal governments -- the aff's emphasis of devolution of power to communities [conceals]{.underline} underlying class relations and homogenizes tribes**

**Rose,** SUNY Buffalo**, 2015**

(Samuel W, "Two thematic manifestations of neotribal capitalism in the
United States," Anthropological Theory, 2015, Vol 15, Sci-Hub HDCSW-JCP)

In practice, **[defenses of 'tribal sovereignty' are]{.underline}**
[little more than the **advocacy for and defense of neotribal
power**]{.underline}, [and function to eliminate not simply criticism of
neotribal governments but even discussions of alternatives.]{.underline}
The same is true of discussions of identity and citizenship. [Emphasis
on 'bloodedness', authenticity, and a return to 'traditionalism' and
community as natural and apolitical categories **conceals the power and
class relations behind them**. It hides the functional role of the
federal government as the arbiter of indigeneity]{.underline}, [rather
than having the question of indigeneity and group membership being
decided by the people themselves.]{.underline} Likewise,
[neotraditionalism hides how these concepts are marshaled in support of
the consolidation of tribal elite power and the homogenization of the
tribal elite themselves]{.underline}. [Neotraditionalist
ideology]{.underline} is dangerous because it **[obscures the
distinction between tribal governments and indigenous
communities]{.underline}** [in presenting them as functionally
equivalent]{.underline}. Lastly, [neotraditionalist ideology conceals
the fundamental changes that have occurred in indigenous societies and
political economies in this era of late capitalism.]{.underline}

### 1nc \[already in shell\] - Military Link 

#### Military and economic development in the Arctic secures capitalist power at the expense of Indigenous peoples 

**Hanaček et al** Researcher at the Institute of Environmental Science
and Technology, Autonomous University of Barcelona **24**

\[Ksenija Hanaček -. "Green and climate colonialities: Evidence from
Arctic Extractivisms." *Journal of Political Ecology*, Vol. 34, Issue 1,
2024, https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.5512, July 19th, 2025, HDCSW- JW\]

[The Arctic]{.underline} region also [contains security and military
interests of nation-states, as well as political and economic
interests]{.underline} (Heininen, 2014). For instance, integral parts of
modern industrialized nation-states include Sápmi in Fennoscandia, the
Yukon in the Northwest territories and Nunavut in Canada, and the
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous region of the Russian Federation. In short,
[almost all Indigenous homelands have been claimed and controlled by
nation-states to the south of the Arctic. Different state-corporate
nexuses, located outside the circumpolar North, impose their own
economic interests for which both land and resources are
needed]{.underline} (Muller-Wille, 1987). [In the process, Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} of the Circumpolar North [lose access to and
control over their land and its traditional use]{.underline}.

Within this context, [development projects and planning in the Arctic
are]{.underline} being [driven by ideas of advanced technological
progress and economic growth]{.underline} (Egerman et al., 2003). [Some
of its regions are integral parts of modern industrialized
nation-states]{.underline} (although this is not the case for Greenland,
an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark) (Muller-Wille,
1987; Nuttall, 2012). These [states cater to particular economic sectors
and corporations in different extractive sectors, easing their access to
Arctic Indigenous and other territories]{.underline}.

The Canadian state is notorious for supporting via diplomacy, spying and
other operations the global expansion of the mining industry (Bélanger,
2018; Keeling and Sandlos, 2015). The Canadian state-mining nexus
continues to provoke major socio-ecological injustices in many parts of
the world including the Arctic, as in the forceful expansion to
Fennoscandia and particularly Finland by Canadian gold and other mining
companies (Kröger, 2016).

In Alaska, the [oil and gas extraction business has been marked
by]{.underline} recent [attempts]{.underline} of the Trump
administration (2017--2021) [to open up drilling in conservation areas.
Arctic policies may change with government fluctuations following,
however, a general trend to extractive expansion.]{.underline} Besides
Russia, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has been an
important player building major logistical and military infrastructures
in the Arctic]{.underline}. After the end of the [Cold War]{.underline}
in the 1990s, these [infrastructures are]{.underline} currently [being
rebuilt, to serve resource extraction and great power
competitions]{.underline} (Dodds and Nuttall, 2019). These militaristic
goals play a major role in the Russian contemporary attempts to claim
sovereignty over Arctic territories and resources. Other Arctic powers,
especially the Nordic states, seem to be much less inclined to expand
militarily and forcefully to grab territories or resources (Kröger,
2019).

### 2nc - Missile defense -- contracts 

#### Missile defense lines the pockets of the military industrial complex and Musk 

**Cirincione, national security analyst and member of the Council for
Foreign Relations, 25**

\[Joe Cirincione, 5-25-2025, \"Trump's "Golden Dome" Won't Work---but
It'll Make Elon Musk Richer\", New Republic,
https://newrepublic.com/article/195608/trump-golden-dome-elon-musk-richer?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=SF_TNR&utm_source=Facebook,
Accessed 7-10-2025, HDSCW-JX\]

Elon [Musk,]{.underline} after months omnipresent in the White House,
was nowhere near the Oval Office on May 20 when Donald Trump announced
his new "Golden Dome" space weapons system. He didn't have to be. [He
had already maneuvered his companies to benefit substantially from the
\$25 billion Trump said he would spend immediately and the hundreds of
billions in federal contracts the new effort will spawn.]{.underline}

Though [Mus]{.underline}k has largely disappeared from Washington and
Trump's media feeds, his [influence lives on]{.underline}. Earlier this
month, the acting inspector general at the Department of Defense got a
letter asking for a probe into Musk's lobbying on Golden Dome from 42
congressional Democrats, including the late Representative Gerry
Connolly in one of his last acts as the ranking Democrat on the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

The members believe that [Musk's "formal or informal participation in
any process to award a government contract raises serious conflict of
interest concerns]{.underline}, including the possibility that SpaceX is
a top contender for the Golden Dome contract because of Mr. Musk's
position in the government."

This, they said, "raises concerns about whether defense contracts to
build a Golden Dome are an effective way to protect Americans or are
meant to enrich Mr. Musk and other elites."

[Their fears are well grounded. Though the 60-year pursuit of an
effective national missile defense system began with an ideological
desire to replace arms-control agreements with a military shield, for
decades, the primary driver has been the pursuit of lucrative
contracts.]{.underline}

Musk understands that there is a [lot of money to be made in missile
defense]{.underline}. The program has grown from a relatively modest \$3
billion a year, back when Ronald Reagan first started talking it up
during the 1980s, to over \$30 billion a year for "missile defense and
defeat programs" today. [Since the development of the first interceptors
in 1962, the government has spent more than \$531 billion]{.underline}
[on "multiple ineffective missile defense schemes,"]{.underline}
according to Stephen Schwartz, a nuclear budget analyst. Over \$453
billion of that was spent in failed efforts launched by Reagan in 1983
to fulfill his fantasy of a shield that could "protect us from ballistic
missiles just as a roof protects a family from rain."

All we have to show for the effort is 44 ground-based interceptors in
Alaska and California that are so flawed that the Pentagon last year
awarded Lockheed Martin an \$18 billion contract to build a brand-new
replacement system. While missile defenses against short-range rockets,
like those Hamas fired into Israel, can be effective, no country has
built a system that can reliably shoot down nuclear missiles that travel
thousands of miles at many times the speed of sound.

Trump claims that Reagan "didn't have the technology," but now we have
"super technology" that will provide "close to 100 percent protection"
against "hypersonic missiles, ballistic missiles, and advanced cruise
missiles; all of them will be knocked out of the air." Even better, said
Trump, the whole thing will only cost \$175 billion and be "fully
operational before the end of my term."

This is all nonsense, of course. [The Congressional Budget Office
estimates that a Golden Dome system would cost as much as \$831 billion
over two decades]{.underline}. Scientists warn that even if all the
complex technology and computer software works flawlessly, an adversary
could defeat the defenses by simply launching a salvo of missiles that
would overwhelm the system and deploying basic countermeasures that
could spoof the sensors.

[Whether the systems works or not doesn't matter for the contractors who
get rich on contracts to design, develop, and deploy these weapons.
That]{.underline} may be why Musk has partnered with two other companies
owned by Trump supporters, software maker Palantir and drone builder
Anduril, to help design and build the system. Musk's company estimates
that the initial design contracts alone could be worth between \$6
billion and 10 billion, according to Reuters.

[Think of it as a "pump and dump" scam, where investors buy a cheap
stock, inflate its value with hype and exaggerated expectations, then
get rich by selling the stock at the inflated levels. Here, contractors
and their government supporters take an old, devalued concept, pump up
its value with exaggerated promises of instant success, secure big,
multiyear contracts to build it, then get even more contracts for more
systems when the ones they built don't work.]{.underline}

### 1nc \-\-- renewables/green innovation

#### Their association of capitalist growth with technological progress wrong -- better effective science through de-growth approach 

**Hickel 23**

\[Jason Hickel - professor at the Institute for Environmental Science
and Technology and the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology at
the Autonomous University of Barcelona. "On Technology and Degrowth."
*Monthly Review,* 7/1/23,

-- JM\]

So, [the public debate about degrowth founders on a false dichotomy. The
real conflict is not between technology and anti-technology. It is about
how technology is imagined and the conditions under which it is
deployed]{.underline}. [Degrowth research makes a strong claim to having
a more scientific]{.underline} (and more just) [approach to
technological visions]{.underline}.

What about the question of technological progress? [In media discourse
capitalist growth is often conflated with]{.underline}---[or even seen
as necessary for]{.underline}---[technological progress]{.underline}.
But here again, [this is sloppy thinking]{.underline}.

[Yes, we need innovation to solve the ecological crisis.]{.underline} We
need better solar panels, better insulation, better batteries, better
recycling, better methods for producing steel, etc. [But we do not need
aggregate growth to get these things]{.underline}. [If the objective is
to achieve specific kinds of innovation]{.underline}, [then target those
directly rather than grow the whole economy indiscriminately and hope it
will magically deliver the innovation we need]{.underline}. [Is it
really reasonable to grow the plastics]{.underline} industry, the
[beef]{.underline} industry, [and]{.underline} the [advertising
industry]{.underline} in order [to get more efficient
trains?]{.underline} [Does it really make sense to grow dirty things in
order to get clean things?]{.underline} We must be smarter than that.
[Necessary innovations can be achieved directly]{.underline} -- [through
public investment in innovation]{.underline} -- [while simultaneously
scaling down less necessary forms of production]{.underline}. In fact,
the former is enabled by the latter. [Engineering talent]{.underline}
that is [presently organized around]{.underline} developing, say,
[advertising algorithms, can be remobilized]{.underline} instead [to
develop better renewables and transit systems]{.underline}.

Furthermore, we should note that [capitalist growth
imperatives]{.underline} quite [often limit technological
progress]{.underline}. Under capitalism, [firms organize innovation not
around socially necessary objectives]{.underline}, [but rather around
what serves]{.underline} their growth and [profits]{.underline}. So [we
get innovations to maximize fossil fuel extraction]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} maximize [planned obsolescence, but precious little in
areas that are clearly necessary but less profitable]{.underline} (such
as renewable energy) [or not profitable at all (such as public transit,
repairable products, or medicines]{.underline} for neglected tropical
diseases).15 Furthermore, [even when innovations are socially
beneficial, they are]{.underline} often [locked up under patents that
prevent rapid dissemination]{.underline} ([as with]{.underline} the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 [vaccines and battery technology]{.underline}).

Additional crucial flaws would also severely hamper the GND's potential
for real change. Foremost, current variants of the GND retain a
significant [dependence on technological solutions]{.underline} to
problems that are not necessarily technological in nature. They also
[say nothing about the need to reduce material consumption or energy
demand overall]{.underline} (except 'weatherization' to reduce domestic
consumption). Thus for example, they fail to acknowledge that [**even
if** the US **transitioned completely** to **renewable energy** and
technologies]{.underline} like electric cars, [it would still be
engaging in **unsustainable exploitation** of nature and natural
resources.]{.underline}

Moreover, [by focusing]{.underline} heavily [on carbon]{.underline}
reductions, the [GND ignores]{.underline} other major ecological crises,
including those of [biodiversity and ecosystem loss, driven by
uncontrolled consumption in the Global North.]{.underline} Finally,
while it commits to holding corporations accountable to domestic climate
goals and labour standards, it does not ensure that they will also be
held accountable globally (beyond carbon emissions). Similarly, while
Bernie's proposals were committed to ending rising inequality within the
US, through taxes on fossil fuel billionaires and "green jobs" for
low-income sectors, [it is not clear how]{.underline} this [inequality
would be addressed in a way that does not just shift it outside the
US.]{.underline}

As such, the GND cannot adequately challenge the structures of
[capitalism and patriarchy]{.underline}, and from a global perspective
[remains rooted in "green" colonialism. It]{.underline} effectively
[perpetuates]{.underline} the [quest for **cheap raw materials** and
**black and brown labouring bodies** to achieve **"green"
growth.**]{.underline}

In the context of the Global South, then, [the GND]{.underline} has
failed to illustrate what is "new" about it. Put differently, it [is
simply inadequate]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} indeed
[unjust]{.underline}, [in our current hyper-connected world]{.underline}
(laid bare by COVID-19) to limit a GND to the national policy of Global
North countries. For instance, if a GND for Europe promises to be
"climate neutral," [whose resources and labour will be deployed to
power]{.underline} Europe's [unrestrained energy and consumption
demands?]{.underline}

[This is an especially **salient question**]{.underline} [given how
**renewable technologies** for "cleaner," "greener" economies **depend**
on the **same socially and ecologically degrading** land and labour
**practices** as **traditional energy** sources. They are]{.underline}
also [conveniently located in]{.underline} countries of [the Global
South, such as Bolivia and DR Congo, where regulatory safeguards are
more lax.]{.underline} The [uneven playing field]{.underline} of
resources and regulatory frameworks [works in the favour of those
who]{.underline} have not only historically usurped resources and
labouring bodies around the world but also [currently dictate the modus
operandi of development, including its "greener and eco-friendly"
varieties.]{.underline} What is easily forgotten in [**"eco-friendly"
talk** is just how development models of the Global North are
**structurally founded on dehumanization,** in which hundreds of
millions across the globe are seduced and stripped of their diverse ways
of knowing the world]{.underline}, and dumbed down into passive
consumerist onlookers and screen junkies, unable or unwilling to
acknowledge (much less act upon) the consequences of their consumption
patterns.

Yet, in a world beholden to the imperatives of global capitalism and

North America and Europe) [that have been on the "frontier" of
imperialist pursuits are still in the game, new players like India and
China also want a piece of the pie.]{.underline} Indeed, [the very
notion of "national development" is becoming increasingly
irrelevant]{.underline} in an era [when state-backed transnational
corporations are active in dispossessing people of their lands and their
food and cultural sovereignty domestically, regionally, and

**Oceans as Arteries**

I encountered the realities of this system firsthand during ethnographic
fieldwork in 2015, when I spent six weeks riding across the Pacific
Ocean on another vessel owned by Evergreen (the company that operates
the Ever Given). Its capacity was 8,100 TEU---the standard unit of cargo
size, based on the volume of a standard twenty-foot container box. That
is only some 40 percent of the Ever Given's capacity, but still the ship
was as long as two Eiffel towers are tall. The crew comprised
twenty-three, all men. For forty-eight days at sea, we scrubbed rust,
swabbed the deck, cleaned the walls of forecastle, mended leaky pipes,
and monitored the temperature of reefers, the refrigerated containers
holding perishable goods. Except for the faint smell of apples
interlaced with the stench of the heavy fuel oil, the crew knew nothing
of the contents of the thousands of containers on board.

This is par for the course[. In the era of containerization, ships no
longer carry shipping manifests]{.underline}. A clerk in Shenzhen or Los
Angeles calculates what cargo should be loaded and where, and sailors
are there to maintain the lifespan of the ship, keeping rust, dirt, and
engine malfunctions at bay[. The alienation of workers from the value of
their labor that Karl Marx first described in the context of factories
is only compounded on the ocean. Whatever the containers carry---from
microchips to rubber chickens, produce to hazardous waste---is rendered
illegible to the workers charged with ensuring their circulation. The
container, economist Marc Levinson
has [written](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box),
"made the world smaller and the world economy bigger]{.underline}." [Its
main innovation was what the industry calls "intermodality": it could be
detached from trucks, lifted by crane, and stacked directly onto
oceangoing vessels, standardizing and radically reducing the costs of
transportation.]{.underline}

The first container ship to cross the Atlantic, the SS *Fairland*,
provided proof of concept in 1966; a year later, the company that owned
it
would [carry](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/shipping-container-idea-before-time-180963730/) war
materiel from the West Coast to Cam Ranh Bay during the Vietnam War and
ship boxes back to the United
States [stuffed](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box) with
Japanese goods. But even as the world got bigger, workers got
shortchanged. [Containers ushered in the mechanization of ports, just as
states, acting with and like corporations, sought to repress the power
of organized longshore labor. Jobs that had once required multiple gangs
of stevedores to load and unload goods from ships were almost entirely
wiped out. Unloading became the lonely work of pushing levers atop
behemoth gantry cranes that lift and drop steel boxes into an endless
grid of squares.]{.underline}

[Abstraction is, in large part, the point of logistics]{.underline}. In
their new book *Capitalism and the Sea: The Maritime Factor in the
Making of the Modern World,* Liam Campling and Alejandro Colás argue
that "[circulation is the lifeblood of global capitalism, and the oceans
act as its arteries." Unique among other spaces of capitalist
production, the sea is both passageway and precondition for capitalism
to conquer new frontiers]{.underline}. Prior to World War II, it had
been cheaper and more efficient for industrial producers to use iron and
coal as energy sources, but after the war the 1948 Marshall Plan changed
the economic calculus with investment in oil infrastructure. Oil was
lighter and easier to transport, and embracing it would weaken the
structural power of European miners whose strikes could shut down
production. Thus, as Timothy Mitchell explains in *Carbon
Democracy *(2014), the global shift from coal to oil simultaneously and
conveniently dealt a severe blow to working-class power.

9.1 Sustainable Ubiquity

Anthropogenic [climate change]{.underline} has a palpable presence---in
[wildfires]{.underline}, [flooding]{.underline}, [drought]{.underline},
annual or even more frequent "once-in-a-century" [weather]{.underline}
events, dangerous levels of wet-bulb and even dry-bulb heat. Then there
is the [grave social and economic fallout of these
occurrences]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic itself has much to do
with climate change---with an [intensified "gobbling" of
ecosystems]{.underline} that ["enables viruses to jump from previously
isolated]{.underline} wild [animals into]{.underline} the [food
system]{.underline} and agricultural laborers and then, by way of food
products and travelers, move throughout the world in a matter of
weeks."1 [Pandemics]{.underline} and other infectious disease events
[are]{.underline} already [becoming]{.underline} far more [frequent on
the]{.underline} current business-as-usual [trajectory of global
capitalism]{.underline} and anthropogenic climate change. The [question
is no longer]{.underline} one of [denial vs. acceptance]{.underline} of
climate science.2 [It is about power dynamics within]{.underline} those
[concrete realities]{.underline} in this particular conjuncture of the
Anthropocene.

Sustainability is now a commonplace term. Its connotations span from the
minimal definition of sustainability as "avoiding extinction and living
to survive and reproduce"3 to various renditions of "sustainable
development" as "development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs."4 For all the attention given to [sustainability]{.underline}, it
[remains a fuzzy concept that accommodates a multitude of often
conflicting goals]{.underline}.5 Typically, uses of the concept involve
or gesture towards ecological concerns and relate to the broad field of
sustainable development as defined above at the Brundtland Conference in
1987. But, as previous environmental discourses of "natural"
conservation or preservation fall out of use, today's usage of the term
reflects a spreading concern with climate change.

In this chapter, I review some controversies haunting policy and
academic debates on sustainability. Irreconcilable objectives within
commitments to [sustainability produce]{.underline} what I call [a
"sustainability paradox]{.underline}." On the one hand, analyses,
models, [policies]{.underline}, and projects [are committed
to]{.underline} what we might term ["fundamental system
preservation"]{.underline}---[not]{.underline} in terms of [ecological
systems but]{.underline} in terms of [dominant human socioeconomic
ones]{.underline}. On the other hand, there is the understanding that
anthropogenic climate change is engendered by that very [socioeconomic
activity]{.underline}. When a framework predicated on fundamental
(social) system preservation [tries to assimilate even minimal inputs
from the climate sciences or interdisciplinary climate
research]{.underline}, the [resulting "sustainable" frameworks are
fundamentally incoherent]{.underline}. The [sustainability
paradox]{.underline} thus [arises in seeking maximal socioecological
sustainability through safeguarding]{.underline} [the very social system
that undermines such a possibility]{.underline}.

I offer the concept of "the extractive circuit" to give us a better
guide to what Actually Existing Capitalism is today and the [vicious
cycle capital deploys in]{.underline} the [metabolic interchange between
society and nature]{.underline}. I then review scientific, policy, and
social scientific bodies of literature that attempt to "solve" the
sustainability paradox in terms of what appears to be a broad social and
ecological definition of sustainability: the elaboration of a global
sustainable human "ecological niche," well-disposed to the flourishing
of some 7--9 billion humans. [Sustainability]{.underline}, understood in
this way, [calls for a radical new relationship of human society with
its ecological niche, even as it acknowledges that all programs for
climate mitigation and adaptation are, in some sense, an artificial
human contrivance.]{.underline} Key debates, from "green capitalism" to
"degrowth" to eco-Marxism, are reviewed with regard to the formulas they
produce for achieving this objective. Finally, I propose some broad
parameters elaborating a sustainable global human ecological niche.

9.2 Sustainable Confusion

Prior to Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer's popularization of the
concept of the Anthropocene as a geologic age---one defined by human
activity as "a major geologic force" in terms of the total Earth system6
---natural science typically focused on discrete human-environmental
impacts (like those of pesticides on bird eggs and cancer cells),
whereas contemporary approaches are comprehensive and systemic.7
Prevalent natural and social scientific approaches to sustainability
tend to portray it as a balance between ecological limits, resource use,
and human needs. For example, in an interdisciplinary natural and social
scientific inquiry into ecological economics, the fundamental question
sustainability poses is: "what level of biophysical resource use is
associated with meeting people's basic needs, and can this level of
resource use be extended to all people without exceeding critical
planetary boundaries?"8 The [systemic nature of anthropogenic climate
change means]{.underline} that almost all [contemporary analysis has
shifted into thinking beyond knock-on effects and is instead concerned
with how social and natural systems are co-imbricated]{.underline}.
[Seemingly distant social phenomena]{.underline} can [have ecological
implications]{.underline}, and there is nothing particularly more
"natural" about Holocene conditions than Anthropocene ones. And yet, as
scholars like Andreas Malm have argued adamantly, the case can be
overstated---humans do not produce all of nature.9

Obviously, the [sustainability of ecosystem health is hardly the same
as]{.underline} the [concern for sustainability in sustainable
development studies, even if]{.underline} some of [the latter
incorporate ecological concerns]{.underline} and some of the former,
socioeconomic analysis. [Sustainable development]{.underline} in policy
is usually the assumed goal.10 But not only [is]{.underline}
sustainability in such studies [ill-defined]{.underline}, it is
[often]{.underline} here [at odds with itself]{.underline}. Like many
mainstream policy approaches, [sustainability policy is focused
fundamentally on understandings of ecology and economy that take as
given]{.underline} the [continuity and maintenance of current global
socioeconomic systems]{.underline}. [These are incommensurate goals
prima facie;]{.underline} [the sustainability paradox leaks
into]{.underline} even many [deliberate attempts to resolve
it.]{.underline} Even in the relatively nascent interdisciplinary field
of "sustainability science" [the core question---"What is to be
sustained?"---fails to be addressed]{.underline}.11

The [Paris Accords are a key example]{.underline} of how this question
gets avoided, thereby bringing to light the sustainability paradox.
Although the Accords are treated with reverence in many media, policy,
and political circles, even at their inception in 2015, assuming
universal compliance to the non-binding treaty, [it was technically
already impossible to reach]{.underline} the [stated targets of keeping
global temperatures to a less than 1.5 °C]{.underline} increase above
pre-industrial levels over the next 80 years, [within the treaty's
framework.]{.underline} In the simplest terms, [even with a reduction in
the rate of carbon emissions, emissions in toto are on track to increase
by about 3% per year.]{.underline} To hold to the goals of the climate
treaty, [actual emissions---not their rate]{.underline}---[would have to
decrease]{.underline} in the range of [2--3% per year]{.underline}.
Given that [this is impossible under current socioeconomic
conditions]{.underline}, [in most likely scenarios, the 2 °C
increase]{.underline} threshold [will be passed by 2050]{.underline},
[perhaps]{.underline} [as early as the mid-2030s]{.underline}.12
Δ1.5--[2 °]{.underline}C is [for the vast majority of people on the
planet]{.underline}---although not everyone, universally, together, as I
have shown elsewhere13---[already a catastrophic situation]{.underline}.
This is true even for affluent majorities in the developed geographies,
as evidenced by assessment on a host of standard measures, [including
insurmountable prospects for]{.underline} many [coastal
regions]{.underline}, further [food system destabilization]{.underline},
and the direct effects of "[dangerous heat," rampant disease, poverty,
etc.]{.underline} The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) on a Δ1.5 °C world paints an even bleaker picture
for a Δ2 °C world. [This is all without considering]{.underline} further
[social factors aggravating the situation, such as resource warfare and
mass migration]{.underline}.14

9.3 What We Talk About When We Talk About Sustainability

[Common measures of climate change]{.underline} do not track population
growth per se; they do not track increasing consumption from developing
states; they do not track individual consumption choices. They seem
unaffected by common climate interventions, from fuel efficiency
standards to the Paris Accords. They [track economic
growth]{.underline}.15 [This link is well-established and
uncontroversial]{.underline} (cited for example at the IPCC's highest
confidence levels of "robust evidence and high agreement")16---[this is
why so much debate surrounds questions of absolute
decoupling]{.underline}, i.e. disconnecting economic growth from
greenhouse gas emissions and other climate metrics. Whether one is
discussing the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century or "the
Great Acceleration"---the period beginning in the mid-twentieth century
of neargeometric, interlinked socioeconomic expansion and anthropogenic
transformation of Earth systems---growth is better understood as
increased economic activity in pursuit of proftability.17 Growth also
must be addressed in more abstract terms, but the centrality of
capitalism to these developments is also uncontroversial. As the
economist Nicholas Stern once claimed, climate change is capitalism's
"largest ever market failure." The implication of Stern's argument is
that climate change is an example of the market malfunctioning---with
just the right policy fix, capitalism should provide its own solution.
In 2012, the geophysicist Brad Werner proffered a rather different
thesis in a talk colorfully entitled "Is the Earth F\*\*ked?" As
Christopher Wright and Daniel Nyberg helpfully summarize: ["we are in
this mess not because the market system is not working well enough but
because it is working too well."]{.underline}18

Werner is far from alone in conclusions like this. Closer to the
generally circumspect norm in the natural sciences concerning social and
political analyses, one finds arguments like those in the now famous
so-called "Hothouse Earth" paper for PNAS ("Trajectories of the Earth
System in the Anthropocene"). Leading a team of climate scientists, Will
Steffen, Johan Rockström, and Katherine Richardson, argue:

> The [present dominant socioeconomic system]{.underline}, however, [is
> based on high-carbon economic growth and exploitative resource
> use]{.underline}. [Attempts to modify this system have met with some
> success locally but little success globally in reducing greenhouse gas
> emissions or building]{.underline} more [effective stewardship of the
> biosphere.]{.underline} [Incremental linear changes to the present
> socioeconomic system are not enough to stabilize the Earth
> System]{.underline}. [Widespread, rapid, and fundamental
> transformations will]{.underline} likely [be required to
> reduce]{.underline} the [risk of crossing the threshold and locking in
> the Hothouse Earth]{.underline} pathway...19

Overall, the paper's concern is with how much uncertainty there is in
climate models and how often this uncertainty is cast in favor of overly
optimistic outcomes. Echoing many other climate researchers, Steffen et
al collect evidence that [climate change does not happen linearly,
but]{.underline} can instead proceed [through thresholds, triggers,
tipping points, and cascading effects]{.underline}. What is easy to miss
in the paper is the subtle socioeconomic argument. The rhetoric is
understated, but the argument is charged:
[capitalism]{.underline}---that is, "the present dominant socioeconomic
system"---[is fundamentally dependent on "high-carbon economic growth
and exploitative resource use."]{.underline} Overall, [the case simply
reflects the empirical record]{.underline}. Similar to the IPCC calls
for "unprecedented transformation," the paper suggests widespread,
rapid, and fundamental transformations to ensure a best-case scenario
for the vast majority of people on Earth. This can be achieved with
already existing technology, but if you look at the appendices Steffen
et al include, they spell out conditions that cannot be reconciled with
existing Global North economies. Furthermore, they are straightforward
about [even the most modest techno-fixes such as]{.underline} Carbon
Capture and Storage ([CSS]{.underline}), which they correctly note [are
still largely theoretical and at best energy-intensive to
produce.]{.underline}20 "[Incremental linear changes are not
enough,"]{.underline} the authors note. [Small-bore reforms and modest
adjustments to the "dominant socioeconomic system" are simply not
credible forms of climate mitigation and adaptation]{.underline}.

#### Capitalism not sustainable -- even if it can hold on to power, that doesn't make it sustainable

Change." Ch. In Capitalism, Democracy, Socialism: Critical Debates. Ed.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most loaded word here is "sustainable."
[There is no single "pure" scientific definition of
sustainability]{.underline} (and, beyond this, climate politics).34 As
stated, [a better grasp of]{.underline} the [material realities
increasingly understood through]{.underline} the [climate sciences is
imperative]{.underline} for even [the most radical and critical thinkers
and movements]{.underline}; it is absolutely vital to understand what
climate scientists are saying about planetary boundaries, trends,
feasible technologies, etc. But [to arrive at something like a program
for sustainability requires moving both with and beyond even some of the
more interdisciplinary scientific methodologies and complex systemic
models]{.underline}.35 This is not simply a question of diverging
normative judgments, as Smil argues in Growth. The bare facts can
support a host of sustainabilities; the paradox does not resolve itself
in only one direction. The same [basic research supports a whole range
of continuities and possibilities]{.underline} in our global human
ecological niche. [It is technically possible to have some version of
sustainability in a Δ3 or Δ4 world, or other scenarios. However, such
scenarios do not live up to the political assumption underwriting most
technical accounts of sustainability: that the purpose of climate
mitigation and adaptation is the best possible socioecological outcomes
for the greatest number of people]{.underline}.

Although there are likely extreme catastrophic outcomes in a
business-as-usual scenario, [what is at stake is unlikely to be
extinction but rather locking-in a "range of conditions" which
preclude]{.underline} the [possibility of mass fourishing]{.underline}.
The [purposeful preservation, promotion, and maintenance]{.underline}
(carving out) [of such conditions is no more "natural" than their
destabilization by human activity]{.underline} (as Marx notes in
Capital, in a very Spinozist moment: what are humans but an arm of
nature which works on itself?).36 7--[9 billion represents actually
existing and likely trajectories of human population numbers.
Flourishing indicates that the question here is not simply a matter of
survival, but of much more]{.underline}.

In a frequently cited definition, Robert Costanza proposes a deceptively
simple formulation of sustainability: "a sustainable system is one which
survives or persists."37 He then clarifies that the interesting
questions are what is the system, how long does it persist, and at what
point can such questions be assessed. What hangs in the balance in
contemporary climate research is systemic irreconcilability---i.e., the
irreconcilability between capitalism as the dominant socioeconomic
system and a global human ecological niche commodious to mass
fourishing. [Capitalism]{.underline}---or, as McKenzie Wark speculates,
"something worse"38---[is perfectly capable of surviving and
persisting]{.underline} (i.e., it is perfectly sustainable), [but only
at catastrophic socioecological cost]{.underline}. Conversely,
[socioecological sustainability, in terms of interrelated mass human and
non-human fourishing, is only possible if capital is no longer the
organizing logic of our ecological niche]{.underline}.

The [intense realities of anthropogenic climate change slip into even
some of the most conservative, risk averse documents which attempt to
reconcile]{.underline} the [natural scientific consensus on]{.underline}
the [climate emergency with commitments to maintaining the
socio-political status quo]{.underline}. In documents like IPCC reports,
we are told directly that "limiting warming to 1.5 °C is possible within
the laws of chemistry and physics but would require unprecedented
transitions in all aspects of society."21 At the same time, the authors
note that attempts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are "limited
by economic, financial, human capacity and institutional constraints" at
every turn.

The clarity of the empirical case makes for some unusual bedfellows:
Marxists and business school professors, Wall Street traders
(off-the-clock) and ecological activists, community organizers and
climate scientists. Not only are analyses converging on capitalism as
the key driver of climate change, but more broadly on the unsustainable
ecology of capitalism, at least as we know it. Bracketing for a moment
what I call "right-wing climate realisms,"22 it is clear that [nothing
short of this convergence towards a political-ecological critique of
capital and the various forms of "radical" or "unprecedented"
transformations this demands, is where most good faith attempts at
understanding sustainability today or at engaging systemically with
climate change end up. This represents a sharp break with what remains
of the legitimacy of "consensus" political and policy positions, which
remain firmly within the sustainability paradox and committed to
fundamental system preservation]{.underline}.23

It is perhaps unsurprising that at this juncture one fnds a broad
coalition of ecoMarxists, eco-feminists, some ecological economists, and
anti-colonial and anti-imperial ecological activists and thinkers across
the world who are already critical of capitalism on multiple grounds. My
own thinking is deeply indebted to theirs. It is, though, for both
ideological and empirical reasons, necessary to examine the range of
analyses which alight on the socioecological centrality of capitalism as
the principal driver of climate change. [Critiques that are not
explicitly anti-capitalist in their origin but which arrive at a
contemporary critique of capitalism through ecological considerations
not only help underline the salience of existing radical critiques, and
the unavoidability of discussing capitalism in terms of climate change,
but also offer often distinct and complementary perspectives, crucial
data, and analyses vital for synthesis]{.underline}. One can, as noted,
see this with increasing frequency within climate science research
itself. Telling in this regard is the aforementioned work by Wright and
Nyberg, who deploy a seemingly straightforward business-management
approach (and with invaluable observational, historical, and interview
data from frm actors). The two authors end up working through the
empirical data as well as their own research on everything from internal
firm conflict and emotion to "green" washed marketing and products only
to fnd their way into a unique ecological synthesis of Marx and
Schumpeter. Climate change is what they term, in this synthesis,
"creative self-destruction."24 In the end, they present a case similar
to the "war-footing" position found in far more explicitly radical
arguments like those of Andreas Malm, Naomi Klein, or the recent A
Planet to Win by Kate Aronoff, Daniel Aldana Cohen, Alyssa Battistoni,
and Thea Riofrancos.25

Another fascinating example on this second spectrum is Kate Raworth's
infuential Doughnut Economics, which has been widely acclaimed and
adopted by many climate researchers. Even as she assiduously avoids too
much directly radical material (readers will detect passing observations
from Marx and Engels, Gal Alperowitz, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Joan
Robinson, and others), [Raworth makes the case that there is simply no
way to reconcile prevailing economic wisdom within her rough definition
of sustainability]{.underline}, which she defines as meeting human needs
within "planetary boundaries" as they have been put forth within climate
science literature. [She skewers neoclassical economics for having no
real theory of inputs at all]{.underline}. She demonstrates how
[mainstream macroeconomic concepts concerning climate seem to have no
bearing on reality]{.underline}. She shows how [the "Environmental
Kuznets Curve"]{.underline}--- the idea that, as societies develop, they
pollute at an increasing rate, but then once "development" is achieved,
pollution begins falling---[is just as historically myopic as the
original Kuznets Curve has been shown to be, in terms of economic
inequality]{.underline}. She quietly argues that the case for [absolute
decoupling is most likely not possible and certainly inadvisable in
high-income nations]{.underline}. Her proposed "doughnut" describes a
space beyond mere basic human need within ecological capacity---a
version of the "safe operating space" described in some climate science
research. She walks through the limitations of every market-based
approach until she is describing a socioeconomic system so radically
reformed that, while it is technically capitalism by some definitions,
it is barely recognizable as such.26 Although she does not say it
outright, Raworth's doughnut describes market activity without the
accumulation of capital; what social surplus remains as "profit" is
essentially zero-sum.

### 2NC\-\--Arctic Impact Framing 

#### The Arctic is not terra nullius\-\--don't sacrifice Arctic peoples to the altar of extraction and economic growth

However, [the Arctic region is not a terra nullius or an 'empty polar
region' to be exploited and extracted at will]{.underline} (Gritsenko,
2018). On the contrary, [it is home to approximately four million
people, 12% of whom are Indigenous]{.underline} (except for Iceland)
(The Arctic Council, 2015b). [There is a diversity of cultural,
historical and economic backgrounds among Arctic peoples, and there are
many examples of Indigenous respect for the elements of nature that are
deemed to be sacred]{.underline} (Herrmann and Heinämäki, 2017). [The
Arctic lands, waters, coasts and icescapes are places of Indigenous
mobility and occupancy]{.underline} (Aporta et al., 2014). Arctic
Indigenous peoples include, for example, the Sámi in northern Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Northwest Russia, the Nenets, Khanty, Evenk and
Chukchi in Russia, the Aleut, Yupik and Inuit (Iñupiat) in Alaska, the
Inuit (Inuvialuit) in Canada and the Inuit (Kalaallit) in Greenland.

[Each September, Arctic sea ice reaches its minimum]{.underline} (NASA,
2020a). The average Arctic sea ice extent in September 1979 was equal to
7.05 million square kilometres. A sharp decline was recorded by
September 2020 to 3.92 million square kilometres of ice extent.
Accordingly, September Arctic sea ice has been declining at a rate of
13.1% per decade since the beginning of satellite records in 1979 (NASA,
2020a).

This [rapid and disruptive ice change in the Arctic has led to high
hopes among powerholders for investment, development, and economic
growth]{.underline} (Kröger, 2019; Kröger, 2016). [Melting ice means
that the Arctic Ocean is accessible to navigation and commodity shipping
through the Northern Sea Route, the Northwest Passage, and the future
Trans Arctic shipping route via the North Pole. These new sea trade
routes shorten travel time between the main ports of Asia, Northern
America and Northern Europe.]{.underline} Furthermore, [the ice melts
allow a greater range for icebreakers: ships that are indispensable to
the development of polar trade routes, that cut both the ice and the
distance between important ports in the region]{.underline} (Drewniak et
al., 2018).

[What is occurring in the Arctic can be seen as a microcosm of the world
as a whole, mirroring the speed at which socio-environmental well-being
and values -- often incommensurate with monetary values -- are
sacrificed to the altar of extraction and economic growth]{.underline}
(Martinez-Alier, 2002; Stammler, 2005). The following sections of this
article systematically analyse resource and commodity frontier expansion
in the Arctic, the associated emergence of socio-environmental
conflicts, and resistance to the extractive frontiers in the region.

### Impact -- authoritarianism 

#### cap undermines democracy, fostering authoritarianism in the name of security 

**Bloom, Professor at the University of Essex, 25**

[Neoliberalism represents a transition from militarization]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} heightened [securitization]{.underline}, [as powerful
actors sought to solidify]{.underline} economic and political
[dominance]{.underline} in the context of global capital flows and
social unrest. Post- Second World War militarization focused on
projecting hard power and suppressing dissent, especially in developing
countries where authoritarian regimes were supported to counter
communism, as seen in US- backed regimes in Latin America. In East Asia,
the 'developmental state' model fused authoritarian governance with
economic growth, exemplified by Park Chung- hee's South Korea, where
state-- business alliances drove industrialization while repressing
dissent. [As]{.underline} Cold War ideologies waned and [neoliberalism
gained prominence, the focus turned from militarization to
securitization, reframing repression as a necessary means of ensuring
economic and social stability amidst unfettered capital
flows.]{.underline} Debt crises and structural adjustment programmes
further emphasized the need to maintain order, protect property rights,
and attract foreign investment, making securitization a technocratic
necessity.This narrative legitimized repressive measures in the name of
law enforcement and stability, particularly through austerity and market
reforms imposed by institutions like the IMF to secure financial aid.

[The interventions of]{.underline} international [financial institutions
and]{.underline} powerful [nations,]{.underline} ostensibly [aimed at
economic]{.underline} stabilization and [development,]{.underline} often
[concealed the consolidation of authoritarian governance and the erosion
of democratic norms]{.underline} . [neoliberal restructuring
programmes]{.underline}, with their emphasis on fiscal austerity,
privatization, and market reforms, [legitimized regimes that suppressed
dissent]{.underline} in the name of maintaining law, order, and an
investor- friendly climate. [Democratic freedoms]{.underline} such as
speech, assembly, and press [were curtailed to prioritize]{.underline}
deficit reduction, deregulation, and foreign investment, framing
opposition as a [threat to economic recovery]{.underline}. [This
technocratic approach sidelined democratic leaders and justified
repressive measures against]{.underline} labour unions, [social
movements]{.underline}, and political dissent, portraying them as
obstacles to economic liberalization and stability. [The neoliberal
project]{.underline}, seen in both developing nations and Western
democracies, [used securitization discourse to justify the curtailing of
civil liberties and the consolidation of state power in favour of market
reforms]{.underline}. Thatcher's aggressive economic restructuring in
the UK exemplified how security narratives legitimized state and
repression of dissent. From the 'war on drugs' to heightened border
security, securitization framed erosions of civil liberties as necessary
for safety, normalizing militarization and surveillance. [These
changes]{.underline} were reinforced by cultural shifts towards
individualism and consumerism, [reshaping citizens into economic actors
who prioritized personal security and wealth accumulation over
collective rights and democratic values.]{.underline}

Underpinning these phenomena is an ideology reshaping societies to align
with neoliberal principles. Economists like James Buchanan, influential
in public choice theory, laid groundwork for a libertarian vision
perceiving democratic institutions as hindrances to economic freedoms
and corporate interests This philosophy, fostering corporate power
through institutional strategies over decades, intersects with disaster
capitalism and colonial legacies, forming 'disaster colonialism'
[Disasters perpetuate structural violence and colonial oppression,
enabling capitalist exploitation that disproportionately affects
marginalized groups and reinforces inequalities.]{.underline} The AFC,
as elaborated in the preceding chapter, embodies this convergence --
authoritarian governance, economic power concentration, and crisis
manipulation to consolidate control and benefit elites at democracy's
expense. [Throughout history, upheavals have been exploited to reshape
societies]{.underline}, often under guise of restoring order or enacting
reforms. Today[, neoliberal ideology]{.underline} and corporate capture
[exacerbate repression, concentrating wealth, eroding civil liberties,
and perpetuating exploitation and oppression.]{.underline}

[The pervasive discourse around crime, terrorism, and social instability
fostered a culture of perpetual insecurity, framing these risks as
existential threats requiring extensive control and surveillance, often
at the expense of civil liberties like privacy and due
process.]{.underline} [This narrative normalized the sacrifice of
individual freedoms in exchange for an illusion of security and order,
perpetuated by media and political rhetoric that portrayed such measures
as necessary for national safety.]{.underline} C[oncurrently, the
erosion of community and solidarity under neoliberalism made individuals
more susceptible to fear- based politics, amplifying acceptance of
authoritarian controls]{.underline}. The shift from militarization to
securitization reveals a deeper truth: authoritarian governance and
repression are intrinsic to neoliberalism's structure, essential for
maintaining economic hegemony and disciplining dissent[. This symbiotic
relationship between capitalism and authoritarianism is foundational
rather than incidental, with securitization serving as a legitimizing
discourse that binds economic doctrine and political control into a
cohesive system of power.]{.underline}

For all the talk of how the pandemic was, in Kim Stanley Robinson's
words, "re-writing our imaginations" so that "what felt impossible has
become thinkable", a devastating global pandemic has failed to make the
case for universal healthcare in the US or the value of so-called
"unskilled labour" in the UK, let alone the abolition of capital (
Robinson, 2020 ). Capitalist realism, it seems, persists. Against this
interpretation I want to suggest that [we are not really in capitalist
realism anymore]{.underline}, that we have in fact been leaving it for
quite some time, and that the [signs of what might replace it in our
pandemic-ridden and rapidly warming world are increasingly
apparent]{.underline}. [Unless there is a radical break from capitalism
what will supplant capitalist realism is not the ability to imagine and
fight for a post-capitalist future]{.underline} as Mason, Uetricht and
Milburn had hoped, [but something more ambiguous and]{.underline}
perhaps [ultimately worse]{.underline}. I call this something worse
"capitalist catastrophism." [Capitalist catastrophism]{.underline} is
what [happens when capitalist realism begins to fray at the
edges]{.underline}. It describes a situation in which [capitalism can no
longer determine what it means to be "realistic," not because of the
force of movements assembled against it but because capital's
self-undermining and ecologically destructive dynamics have outstripped
state and capital's powers to control them]{.underline}. Unlike
capitalist realism, [capitalist catastrophism is not a coherent social
formation but the prolonged unmaking of one]{.underline}. It is the
unravelling of capitalist realism that the "catastrophic convergence,"
to borrow Christian Parenti's phrase, of climate breakdown, a global
pandemic, and the persistent violence wrought by capital on the poor and
working class has brought into view ( Parenti, 2012 ).

3\. From capitalist realism to capitalist catastrophism

Fisher's account of capitalist realism had three essential features.
First, that it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the end
of capitalism; second, that the future was cancelled; and third, that
the capitalist realist condition was a class project in need of constant
reinforcement by the bourgeoisie. Under capitalist catastrophism these
features do not so much disappear as mutate and adopt new forms.

3.1. It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of
capitalism

Fisher claimed that Frederic Jameson's oft-misattributed aphorism that
it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism
"captures precisely" what he meant by capitalist realism ( Fisher, 2009
, 2). But this self-assessment is not entirely accurate. While for
Jameson the aphorism pointed rather narrowly to the atrophying of our
imaginations under what he calls "late capitalism" ( Jameson, 1996 ),
for Fisher it pointed to a more expansive, near pervasive, ideological
and affective atmosphere. Capitalist realism was something that we did
as much as something that was done to us, it was a "mood" on the left as
much as a bourgeois ideology, a way of life as much as an institutional
architecture, all of it converging to convince us that "there is no
alternative" to capitalism ( Fisher, 2009 ; 8).

[Under capitalist realism]{.underline} not only was [it easier to
imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism]{.underline} but
we enjoyed imagining the end of the world. Dystopic film and fiction
proliferated: Armageddon ( Bay, 1998 ), The Day After Tomorrow (
Emmerich, 2004 ), 2012 ( Emmerich, 2009 ), The Road ( Hillcoat, 2009 ),
Melancholia ( Trier, 2011 ), and Black Mirror ( Brooker, 2011 ) to name
only a few, fed into the idea that however bad things were now they were
at least not that bad. In Jameson's words, [capitalist realism
encouraged a "nostalgia for the present,"]{.underline} an appreciation
of our lot, and [with this]{.underline} appreciation [came
a]{.underline} further [withering of our imaginations]{.underline} (
Jameson, 1992 ; 279).

The end of the world might have passed for entertainment under
capitalist realism but for us, now, it is all too real. [Under
capitalist catastrophism we no longer need to imagine the end of the
world; we watch it in real time]{.underline}, we read about it on our
social media feeds, and we take to the streets to protest it. [According
to]{.underline} the [I]{.underline}nternational [P]{.underline}anel on
[C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange, [the world is perilously
close to surpassing]{.underline} more than [1.5C of global
warming]{.underline} ( International Panel on Climate Change, 2021 ).
[According to some estimates, it is already too late]{.underline}. The
United Nationals Environment Programme, for instance, warned in October
2022 that there is "no credible pathway" to 1.5C ( United Nations
Environment Programme, 2022 ). Already [icecaps are melting at
unprecedented and irreversible rates]{.underline}, already [wildfires
have roared]{.underline} across Australia, Canada, Tunisia, Greece,
Spain, Siberia, and the West Coast of the United States, already [soil
fertility is in precipitous decline]{.underline}, and already [dangerous
declines in insect numbers are threatening]{.underline} the [collapse of
non-human nature]{.underline} ( Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019 ).
According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, [the
world]{.underline} now [risks entering a "doom loop"]{.underline} in
which [the costs of responding the existing effects of ecological
collapse "draw focus and resources from tackling its causes, leading to
higher temperatures and ecological loss, which]{.underline} then [create
more severe consequences, diverting even more attention and
resources]{.underline}, and so on." The result could be a collective
inability to "realise a transformation of societies that ultimately
avoids catastrophic climate and ecological change" ( Laybourn et al.,
2023 ). Capitalist catastrophism names the period in which, as the
climate scientist Valerie Mason-Delmotte argues, "we can't go back,
whatever we do with our emissions" ( Bodkin, 2019 ). From this point on
[the climate struggle is not just about "saving the
environment,"]{.underline} as we used to be told, [but about how much of
it we will lose, how many of us will die, and how those who are left
will adapt]{.underline}.

Fisher thought that [capitalist realism could only be toppled "if it is
shown to be]{.underline} in some way inconsistent or
[untenable]{.underline}; if, that is to say, capitalism's ostensible
'realism' turns out to be nothing of the sort" ( Fisher, 2009 , 16).
[Under capitalist catastrophism the world approaches this
point]{.underline}. [Austerity, runaway inflation, escalating global
inequalities and]{.underline} the [imperialist core's response
to]{.underline} both [the climate crisis and COVID]{.underline}-19 have
[started to eat away at the fiction of capitalism's compatibility with
human and non-human flourishing]{.underline}. There is nothing
"consistent" about destroying entire crops when there are mile-long
lines for food banks, there is nothing "tenable" about the Bank of
England bailing out the fossil fuel industry in the middle of a climate
catastrophe, and nothing "realistic" about bringing new oil and gas
online in the wake of the war in Ukraine.

The increased visibility of capital's cruel irrationality has given rise
to one of the clearest signs that we are not in capitalist realism
anymore: [it is no longer easier to imagine the end of the world than
the end of capitalism]{.underline}. In just the past few years [the left
has assembled a profusion of post-capitalist imaginaries]{.underline}:
transitional Green New Deals ( Aronoff et al., 2019 ), anti-imperialist
Green New Deals ( Ajl, 2021 ), degrowth futures ( Schmelzer et al., 2022
), eco-modernist utopias ( Frase, 2016 ), fully automated luxury
communism ( Bastani, 2020 ), decolonized agroecological matrices (
Perfecto et al., 2009 ), half-earth socialisms ( Vettese and
Pendergrass, 2021 ), and small farm futures ( Smaje, 2020 ). In many
ways the left's prodigious power of imagination today is reminiscent of
the period of 17th and 18th century utopianism that was in equal parts
praised and lambasted by Marx and Engels. For the writers of The
Communist Manifesto, at a point in capital's early development, when the
proletariat was "still in a very undeveloped state," the "fantastic
pictures" and utopian reveries of thinkers such as Charles Fourier,
Henri de Saint-Simon and Étienne Cabet indicated "the first instinctive
yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society" ( Marx
and Engels, 2017 ; 98).

It could be that after decades of capitalist realism the authors of
today's speculative futures, many of which are generated through a
critical engagement with resurgent social and environmental movements,
are beginning to play a similar role. But if this is the case, it should
be remembered that for Marx and Engels the yawning gap between the
utopian's idyllic visions and the definite social relations that
confronted the working class made their work of only limited use to the
revolutionary movements of their day. [As the proletariat became
conscious of itself as a class waging a war]{.underline} against their
bosses and the state, the [utopians clung to the hope that their
hyper-rationalized blueprints for the future would cut across class
lines. "For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail
to see in it the best possible state of society?,"]{.underline} Marx and
Engels asked ironically ( Marx and Engels, 2017 ; 98).

[There is a risk that today's projections into the future are being
written in a similarly unreflective way by those whose job it is to
publish radical books with radical publishers]{.underline}. All the
while [class struggles are being fought over issues that will make
material, albeit limited, differences]{.underline} to the lives of the
working class: [COVID-19 mutual aid groups,]{.underline} community and
workplace [unions, climate strikes, migrant solidarity networks, food
sovereignty initiatives, and police accountability boards]{.underline}.
[If]{.underline} the [contemplations of today's utopians play any
role]{.underline} at all [in these struggles it is only in the most
tangential of ways]{.underline}. [This is not to say]{.underline} that
[it is wrong]{.underline} for those of us who can [to busy ourselves
with post-capitalist imaginaries;]{.underline} it is to say that [our
capacity to do so implies that progressive movements are at a specific
stage in their development]{.underline}. [After decades of capitalist
realism, they are]{.underline} once again [learning to flex their
utopian imaginations]{.underline}. [They have become skilled **time
travellers**]{.underline}, [projecting their ideals into far-flung
futures untroubled by the vicissitudes of the present]{.underline}.
[They have broken with capitalist realism]{.underline}.

But no sooner is one contradiction overcome than another is encountered.
Under capitalist realism we were incapable of imagining a world after
capitalism. Under capitalist catastrophism this is no longer the case.
Instead, [the gap between what can be conjured]{.underline} in our
mind's eye [and our concrete conditions of struggle appears formidable,
even insurmountable]{.underline}. In a repeat of the problem that Paul
Mattick outlined in his classic text, Spontaneity and Organization, we
find ourselves caught between what is imminently "winnable" in the here
and now and where, with ever increasing urgency, we know that we need to
be ( Mattick, 1978 ). Or in Moishe Postone's words, it is the problem of
traversing the gap between "what is" and what "could be" ( Postone et
al., 2016 ). It is a gap that progressive movements of all kinds have so
far been incapable of closing, a gap that can only be closed by
returning to the questions of anti-capitalist strategy ( Garo, 2023 )
and the politics of transition ( Mészáros, 2000 ).

3.2. The future is cancelled

When Fisher claimed that the future was cancelled he had in mind
contemporary European culture's inability to invent anything
fundamentally new ( Fisher, 2014 ). Late capitalist culture, he thought,
was moribund. Try as we might we are incapable of inventing new genres
of music, new fashion trends, new cinematographic forms, or new literary
genres. Instead, our culture recycles, montages, hybridizes, and writes
unsatisfying sequels and reboots. Under capitalist catastrophism it is
still the case that [the future is cancelled]{.underline} in this sense.
But whereas Fisher saw the slow cancellation of the future as a
primarily cultural phenomenon, today, [it is increasingly
political]{.underline}. And whereas for Fisher the cancellation of the
future did not mean its literal cancellation, [for many across the world
today the future really is cancelled or]{.underline} indeed, as Danowski
and de Castro argue, [has already been cancelled]{.underline} ( Danowski
and de Castro, 2016 ). The reason for this, quite simply, [is
Euro-American imperialism]{.underline}.

[Capitalist catastrophism is characterized by crises]{.underline} ---
[like]{.underline} the [coronavirus and climate breakdown]{.underline}
--- [that]{.underline} are not immediately economic in origin but
nevertheless [have]{.underline} the [power to destroy business as
usual]{.underline}. Mainstream economists like to call such crises
"exogenous" ( Song et al., 2020 ). These are events that are said to
arrive from outside of the capitalist system "like an asteroid might hit
earth." They come "as a surprise," "there is nothing we can do to
precipitate \[their\] arrival" and they "can cause enormous damage" (
Morad, 2020 ). The distinction between exogenous and endogenous shocks
has helped economists and bourgeois commentators to mystify the true
causes of the pandemic. At the height of the pandemic media commentators
claimed repeatedly that unlike the 2008 financial crisis for which blame
could be apportioned among "irresponsible" lenders and regulators, when
it comes to the coronavirus "nobody's to blame" ( Williams, 2020 ).
Rather, the pandemic is just "one of those unexpected challenges sent to
test the human race and our modern connected society in so many ways we
couldn't have imagined" ( Wootton, 2020 ). It is "something like a
natural disaster --- a spontaneous, accidental eruption that's no one's
fault" ( Zakaria, 2020 ).

None of this is true. For a start, the world's governments have long
been warned about a pandemic of this scale. In 1988 Nobel Laureate
Joshua Lederberg explained that "the single biggest threat to man's
continued dominance on the planet is the virus" ( Lederberg, 1988 ), in
2018 the World Health Organization released a report predicting the
emergence of what it called "Disease X" ( World Health Organization,
2018 ), an unknown pathogen that would cause a "serious international
epidemic" and in 2016 the UK government among other countries was told
that the risk of a pandemic in the country was high and to stockpile
personal protective equipment ( Iacobucci, 2021 ). These warnings all
fell on deaf ears. More fundamentally, it is simply not the case that
the coronavirus is exogenous to the capitalist economy. Though the
precise geographical origins of COVID-19 are still to be determined,
scientists agree that the virus was not fabricated in a Chinese lab but
originated in nature before spilling over into human populations eking
out a living in the informal economies on the edges of capital's
ecologically simplified supply chains ( Wallace, 2020 , Wu, 2021 ) .

The likelihood of such spill overs are exponentially increased by what
Jason Moore calls capitalism's "organization of nature," or the way that
[capitalism tears into, degrades, exploits,]{.underline} recomposes and
redistributes [non-human nature]{.underline} ( Moore, 2015 ). Biologist
Rob Wallace and his co-authors have shown a direct link between
industrial agriculture's circuits of accumulation and pandemics like the
coronavirus ( Wallace et al., 2020 ). What passes for [common practice
in agribusiness]{.underline} --- [deforestation]{.underline}, the
[forced displacement of local populations, monocultures, genetic
selection, and]{.underline} the [undercutting of local smallholder
producers]{.underline} --- [creates near-perfect conditions for novel
viruses to multiply and spill over into human populations]{.underline}.
This means that [the pandemic is not just "one of those things." It
is]{.underline} about as much [a product of global
capitalism]{.underline} as the phones we use, the cars we drive, or food
we eat. Capital's [global circuits of accumulation]{.underline} have
[propelled the virus across planetary vectors]{.underline}, eased its
passage across borders [and facilitated its genetic
mutation]{.underline} ( Brakman et al., 2020 ). Considering all of this
it is no wonder that the pandemic's true origins are routinely
mystified. The coronavirus, like the climate crisis, is an argument
against capitalism, an argument against the European model of
development and progress.

In 1961 Fanon explained that Europe's very way of life was "a scandal
for it was built on the backs of slaves, it fed on the blood of slaves,
and owes its very existence to the soil and subsoil of the undeveloped
world" ( Fanon et al., 2005 , 96). In the colonial period this
oppression took the form of immediate acts of violence wrought upon the
minds and bodies of the subjugated. After decolonization and in the
neoliberal period that Fisher describes, the exploitation of the Third
World took more mediated and subtle forms. As Utsa and Prabhat Patnaik
show us, violence was no longer primarily exercised through force.
Instead, after a brief post-colonial period in which imperialist bonds
were loosened, they were tightened once more not principally through
violence --- though this remained a constant threat --- but through the
arbitrating power of the market ( Patnaik and Patnaik, 2016 ). Wages in
the periphery were deflated to protect the price of Western currencies
while ensuring a constant flow of raw materials and food from the
world's poorest to the richest. This, it was claimed, was the only
"realistic" way for the periphery to develop.

In contrast, [capitalist catastrophism is characterized by an
intensification of immediate forms of subjugation.]{.underline} As the
[uneven and combined crises]{.underline} of the coronavirus and climate
breakdown [loosen capitalism's hold on what it means to be realistic,
the imperialist core drops all pretence of "win--win" scenarios for the
core and periphery to return to a strategy of racialized social and
ecological plunder and economic warfare]{.underline}. Crippling
[sanctions are imposed on sovereign governments such as Cuba, Venezuela,
Syria, and Iran that have been construed as threats to imperial
interests]{.underline} ( Davis, 2023 ), [wars are waged, sovereign
nations occupied, assets and resources stolen]{.underline} ( Kadri, 2019
), [and the international norms]{.underline} like the right to asylum
systematically flouted through policies like the UK's Illegal Migration
Bill and refugee pushbacks ( Stevens et al., 2023 ).

The height of the pandemic gave an important insight into the future
under capitalist catastrophist conditions. The [US and Europe drove up
the costs of crucial medical equipment]{.underline} while [placing
export controls]{.underline} on much-needed ventilators, face masks,
gloves and gowns [leaving the periphery without]{.underline} the
[supplies it needs to combat]{.underline} the [spread of the
virus]{.underline} ( Douglas, 2020 , Martin, 2020 ). Meanwhile, the EU
did little to help the plight of those who have contracted the virus in
cramped refugee camps on its borders. For its part, in what the UK's
Ambassador to Egypt called "a great example of UK-Egypt cooperation,"
the UK bought large amounts of protective equipment from Egypt despite
the country's desperate shortage of equipment for its own doctors.
Egyptian workers who took to social media to protest were swiftly
silenced by their government who know better than to put the interests
of their own people before that of one of their largest investors (
Smith, 2020 ).

Unable to feed themselves without super exploiting Eastern European
labour, countries like the UK and Germany also loosened travel
restrictions on seasonal labour from Europe's internal peripheries.
Meanwhile, outrageously colonial ruminations circulated through
mainstream media outlets. A French doctor, for instance, argued on
national television that it might be "provocative" but vaccination
studies ought to be done in Africa "where there are no masks, no
treatment or intensive care, a little bit like it's been done for
certain AIDS studies, where among prostitutes, we try things, because we
know that they are highly exposed and don't protect themselves" (
Rosman, 2020 ). Under capitalist catastrophism, this is how Europe
treats its internal and external peripheries despite many EU countries
benefiting from selfless acts of international solidarity. Vietnam
donated 550,000 masks to Europe, Cuba sent doctors to Italy in an act of
medical internationalism and China donated PPE to several badly affected
European countries. Europe accepted it all without fanfare and without
reciprocation. Europe's response to the pandemic was thus both a brutal
confirmation of Aimé Césaire's assessment that "Europe is indefensible"
and an indication of how economic and extra-economic power is wielded
under capitalist catastrophist conditions ( Cesaire, 2000 ; 32).

[All of this is a pale imitation of what might be expected as capital's
expansion drags us into a warming world]{.underline}. A recent study
found that [by 2050 up to 1.2 billion people could be displaced, their
homes made]{.underline} uninhabitable by searing heat ( Xu et al., 2020
). Yet, in February 2020 Germany announced that it would not be
considering applications from so-called "climate refugees" ( Tidey, 2020
). The signs are becoming increasingly clear. Under capitalist
catastrophism [the imperialist core doubles down on its exploitation of
internal and external peripheries while shrouding this violence in the
ideological garb of doing "whatever it takes" to protect]{.underline}
Europe's [citizens]{.underline}. Here, [climate breakdown is rebranded
as a "threat multiplier" to]{.underline} European or [US "security
interests", while global capitalism transforms itself into a regime of
bio- and eco-apartheid in which the future of many human and non-human
lifeforms really is cancelled]{.underline} ( Keucheyan, 2016 ). [They
are "put in harm's way"]{.underline} ( Mboti, 2023 , 2) [to fund the
imperial core's way of life.]{.underline} They are left to die in
environments that are no longer habitable, drown in Europe's seas,
dehydrate at the Mexican border, and starve among droughts and floods,
[the true cause of their suffering denied]{.underline} ( Lynas, 2020 ).

3.3. From a capitalist realist class project to polycrisis

Lastly, for Fisher, capitalist realism was a neoliberal class project.
As he saw it, our inability to imagine the end of capitalism was the
effect of "anti-libidinal dampening," or the suppression of our
collective desire for something fundamentally better than what
capitalism can offer ( Fisher, 2012 , 134). On this point Fisher's
understanding of neoliberalism closely resembles that of David Harvey.
Both authors interpret neoliberalism as a class project intended to
redistribute wealth and power from the bottom to the top so as to
entrench capital's control over society ( Harvey, 2007 ). Yet such
"political" or "subjective" interpretations of neoliberalism's
ascendency have a tendency to overlook more economic or "objective"
factors such as capital's crisis of profitability since in the 1970's (
Brenner, 2003 ) or neoliberalism's contingent and piecemeal
implementation ( Slobodian, 2020 ). It is because Fisher understands
neoliberalism in this way that his thinking around capitalist realism
was often excessively functionalist. Neoliberalism appears in his work
as the will of neoliberals made manifest; a total, insidious and
near-intractable exercise in political, economic, and libidinal
engineering orchestrated by a clique of omniscient and omnipotent
technocrats.

But if this assessment were ever true, it is no longer today. [The
coronavirus and climate crisis have revealed that there is no "Big
Other,"]{.underline} no conspiratorial cabal of officials instrumentally
shaping history. On the contrary, [it is all too obvious that
capitalists are improvising and improvising badly]{.underline}.
[From]{.underline} former US President Donald [Trump speculating wildly
about]{.underline} the [healing powers of disinfectants]{.underline}, to
former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's advocation of herd
immunity and boastful remarks about shaking everyone's hand before
almost dying, [to]{.underline} the [contemplation of unknown climate
mitigation technologies such as stratospheric aerosol
injection]{.underline} ( Sapinski et al., 2020 ), [state and capital has
no coherent plan]{.underline}. These may be extreme examples but they
confirm rather than refute the rule. Across the core of global
capitalism, the response to the virus was disorganized and chaotic.
COVID-19 again shows us what we can expect as further pandemics and
ecological crises shake capital's foundations. From January to March
2020 the EU fastidiously ignored warnings about the virus. Then, as
deaths began to soar in Italy and Spain, countries implemented
unilateral measures: border closures in Poland caused truck tailbacks
for 40 km, Viktor Orban's sweeping emergency measures consolidated his
control in Hungary and France and Germany imposed export bans on vital
medical equipment. Only after Italy's death toll reached the tens of
thousands did the EU offer a "heartfelt apology" for its lack of
coordination, but by then it was too late ( Henley, 2020 ).

It is because [today's compounding socio-ecological crises outstrip and
outpace state and capital's capacities to control them]{.underline} that
our situation today has become the inverse of what Naomi Klein calls
"disaster capitalism", or the exploitation of a crisis to drive through
projects and policies that would never otherwise survive public scrutiny
( Klein, 2008 ). There is no doubt that we can find examples of what
might be called disaster capitalism in response to the pandemic, or
indeed in the practice of agricultural land grabbing that began in
Ukraine after the outbreak of war ( Mousseau and Devillers, 2023 ), but
there is a qualitative difference in how these function under capitalist
catastrophism ( Ølgaard, 2020 ). The problem with Klein's theory is that
it presumes there is a 'normal' to return to. [Disaster capitalists use
crises as smokescreens to consolidate their power and profits
for]{.underline} the [post-crisis times to come. But what happens when
there is no post-crisis?]{.underline} What happens when the catastrophic
convergence of capitalist exploitation and ecological destruction lead
to what David Wallace-Wells calls a "climate cascade" in which "natural
disasters" cease to be discrete events and start to overlap and compound
one and other? ( Wallace-Wells, 2019 ).

The impression that [we already exist in this state of perpetual,
overlapping, and unrelenting crises]{.underline} is becoming common
place today. It is in this context that Adam Tooze has popularized the
notion of polycrisis, a term first used by Jean Claude Junker in 2016 to
name the simultaneous arrival and mutual amplification of various crises
( Tooze, 2023b , Tooze, 2023a ). It is also in this context that
Collin's Dictionary chose "permacrisis" for its word of 2022, defining
it as "an extended period of instability and insecurity, especially one
resulting from a series of catastrophic events" ( Bushby, 2022 ). Under
capitalist catastrophism, the idea that the world is shaken by
compounding and complexly interlaced crises is at once self-evident and
intensely ideological. Self-evident because the [world really is
experiencing ramifying and mutually amplifying crises]{.underline}.
Ideological because [as each successive crisis hits, states and capital
rush into the breach, promising to make the difficult decisions, or
investments, needed to right the good ship capitalism]{.underline}.
Recall UK prime minister Rishi Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes'
during the pandemic. Or President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act,
which promises to kickstart a green transition and tamp down inflation.
Or capital's promise of various technofixes to avert ecological
collapse: smart agriculture, direct air capture, hydrogen fueled air
travel. [Anything but a change in the fundamentals of capitalist
production and reproduction.]{.underline} This is a hallmark of
capitalist catastrophism. [In a world defined by cascading
socio-ecological calamities, the imperial core's states and capital
cease promising that things will get incrementally better for everyone
and instead pivot towards protecting]{.underline} the [imperial core's
citizens from the worse by making the "difficult" and "pragmatic"
decisions that must be made on a war-torn warming world]{.underline}.
[Borders are strengthened, nationalist sentiments courted,
and]{.underline} the [exploitation of nature and the periphery redoubled
as a green transition is pursued for the few]{.underline} ( Besteman,
2020 , Walia et al., 2021 ).

This is the dreadful paradox of capitalist catastrophism: [a crisis in
government becomes a form of government, the capitalist state's
epidemiological, social, and climatic failures fold back on themselves
to become their own solution]{.underline}. In the absence of an
alternative to capitalism, the system now promises to protect the lucky
few from events that are of its own making. It does this by putting the
world's oppressed and exploited "in harm's way" ( Mboti, 2023 ) or
indeed by cancelling their future altogether. [The result is
eco-apartheid]{.underline}.

4\. Eco-apartheid

In 2019 the then UN special rapporteur on extremely poverty and human
rights, Philip Alston, warned that the world was increasingly at risk of
a "climate apartheid scenario" in which [the wealthy pay to escape the
devastating effects of ecological collapse while the poor are exposed to
insufferable heat, floods, wildfires, storms, and crop
failures]{.underline} ( United Nations, 2019 ). In Alston's evaluation,
the efforts of world governments, international organizations and
non-governmental organizations are "patently inadequate" and "entirely
disproportionate to the urgency and the magnitude of the threat." Alston
went on to suggest that "[democracy and the rule of law]{.underline},
[as well as a wide range of civil and political rights are every bit at
risk]{.underline}...the [risk of community discontent, of growing
inequality, and even of greater levels of deprivation among some groups,
will]{.underline} likely [stimulate nationalist, xenophobic, racist, and
other responses]{.underline}" ( United Nations, 2019 ).

Climate and border scholars have similarly expressed concern about an
emerging regime that they have variously called eco-apartheid or climate
apartheid ( Brisman et al., 2018 , Bruce, 2019 , Rice et al., 2022 ).
Oulifemi Táíwò, for example, has written about the role that police will
have in a warming world. He shows that a growing body of literature
suggests the activity of today's police departments is oriented towards
securing particular spaces for particular classes of people --
controlling the spatial and social distribution of crime rather than its
frequency. As the climate crisis bites down, he concludes, "policing
will not be aimed at preventing climate crises from harming everyone,
but instead [police will be tasked with protecting elites from its
downsides]{.underline}" ( Táíwò, 2020 ). The result will be a regime of
eco-apartheid within counties and within cities.

Daniel Aldana Cohen, meanwhile, argues in a more planetary register that
["a massive global investment in climate related infrastructure is
coming" and]{.underline} that, quote[, "under eco-apartheid,
longstanding environmental harms and]{.underline} the [burdens of the
no-carbon transition would be yoked to the necks of poor and racialized
workers]{.underline}, [while the spoils go to the rich]{.underline} ---
and especially, in Europe and the Americas, the white" ( Cohen, 2019 ).
The key here is that [the transition to net zero carbon economies will
create new spaces of "green extraction"]{.underline} ( Voskoboynik and
Andreucci, 2022 ). [Lithium for eclectic car batteries will flow from
the lithium triangle between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, rare earth
minerals for wind turbines and solar panels will flow from]{.underline}
the [Congolese coltan mines, and landgrabs for biofuels, energy
infrastructure, and carbon credit forests, will dispossess Indigenous
peoples, the poor, and racialized]{.underline} --- as it does today ---
[while the toxic waste materials from producing this new infrastructure
will be dumped]{.underline} --- again, as it is today --- [near
racialized and poor communities in the capitalist core and
beyond]{.underline} ( Dunlap, 2019 ). The [green transition in the
capitalist core]{.underline}, in other words, [is more than likely to
take place at the expense of the land and labour of racialized and poor
communities in the global north and]{.underline} the [global
south]{.underline}.

### Impact -- disease 

#### Cap turns disease impacts -inevitable and worse under capitalism 

**Foster et al 21**

\[John Bellamy Foster, editor of the Monthly Review and professor of
sociology at the University of Oregon, Brett Clark, professor of

HDCSW-JCP\]

In the 1990s, these critical perspectives on medicine, health, and
disease merged into the new ecologically oriented approaches, marked
especially by Nancy [Krieger's "ecosocial theory of disease
distribution]{.underline}," in which she incorporated "[constructs
pertaining to political economy, political ecology, ecosystems,
spatiotemporal scales and levels, biological pathways of embodiment, and
the social production of scientific knowledge"]{.underline} in order [to
transcend the narrow capital-friendly biomedical model of health and
disease.]{.underline}85 This ecosocial approach is in line with a long
history of human ecology, reflected in the work of the
historical-materialist biologist Lancelot Hogben in the 1930s, with his
holistic emphasis on "the ecological system of man."86

In Biology Under the Influence (2007), Lewontin and Levins expressly
criticized the extreme reductionism of the human genome project that
assumes that disease can be fought with designer genes, without
accounting for the "triple helix" represented by the dialectic of gene,
organism, and environment.87 Similar [reductionist fantasies arose with
those who believed that antibiotics could cure all bacterial
infections]{.underline}, [failing to understand that bacteria, as living
organisms, evolve and mutate, negating the actions of specific
antibiotics.]{.underline} The [overuse of antibiotics under capitalism,
particularly in large-scale agribusiness]{.underline} feedlots and
chicken factories, [where antibiotics are used to counter bacterial
diseases associated with overcrowding, have resulted in the rapid
evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or "superbugs," threatening
the human population]{.underline}---producing still another instance of
what Lankester (after Engels) referred to as "Nature's Revenges."88

For Levins, writing in "Is Capitalism a Disease?," [the
five]{.underline} primary [social responses to the modern health crisis
require focusing on: (1) ecosystem health, (2) environmental justice,
(3) the social determination of health, (4) health care for all, and (5)
alternative medicine.]{.underline}89 [To these should be
added]{.underline}, where possible, an [ecosocial approach to scientific
research in medicine. The country that best exemplifies such a social
approach]{.underline} to health care [is Cuba]{.underline}, where all of
these factors are taken into account. [Despite being a small, poor
country confronted by an economic blockade]{.underline} instituted by
the United States, Cuba has emerged as a world leader in biotechnology;
for example, [it is the only country in Latin America to develop
COVID-19 vaccines.]{.underline}90 [This is due to its socialist and
ecological approach, which sees health as a basic productive
factor]{.underline}, in which [total "human capital" counts, rather than
being designated simply as an attribute of individuals, mediated by
class position. Cuba has]{.underline} thus [adopted an entirely
different mode of scientific research]{.underline}, which is [based on a
notion of knowledge as collective, interdisciplinary, concrete, local,
and frequently tacit. This]{.underline}, as explained by Agustín Lage
Dávila, director of the Center for Molecular Immunology in Havana, [goes
against the dominant individualistic, reductionistic, nonlocalized, and
extra-environmental approaches characteristic of the dominant capitalist
model of scientific inquiry.]{.underline}91

[With]{.underline} the onset of the [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic,
[the importance of historical-materialist epidemiology has become
increasingly evident]{.underline}, as in the work of Rob Wallace, author
of Big Farms Make Big Flu and Dead Epidemiologists.92 For Wallace and
the epidemiologists associated with Structural One Health (a more
critical, ecosocial variant of the now-dominant One Health approach
adopted by the World Health Organization), [the key is understanding how
the new wave of deadly epidemics is connected not to "absolute
geographies," but to the circuits of capital introduced by neoliberal
globalization. This includes the destruction of ecosystems and the
agglomeration of vast monocultures of single species, particularly in
animal feedlots.]{.underline} All of [this encourages the spillover of
zoonotic diseases into domesticated animals and humans, transmitted
along the circuits of capital, generating what has been called
"ecological blowback." The extension of capitalist commodity chains and
the neoliberal demolition of public health systems have increased the
speed with which diseases spread globally while making
populations]{.underline}---[particularly]{.underline} the [poor and
racially oppressed]{.underline}---[more vulnerable.]{.underline}93

As explained by Wallace, ["capitalism is not just about producing
metabolic rifts between our economies and ecologies along the way to
profits, destroying our capacity to reproduce as a civilization. It's
also about producing new ecologies that reproduce capital alienating the
web of life."]{.underline}94 A similar view is advanced by Marxian and
Kaleckian economist Riccardo Bellofiore, who has forcefully stated:
"[The subterranean root" of the]{.underline} current [coronavirus
crisis, in its manifold economic, epidemiological, and ecological
aspects, lies in "the systematic robbery and destruction of what is
'other' to capital]{.underline}.... Both 'external' [nature and human
beings]{.underline} as part of nature, in their dialectical
interaction," [are]{.underline} now subject to this system of [universal
alienation. This has led]{.underline} in the present moment [to
"a]{.underline} particularly [dramatic and explicit instance of losing
control of the]{.underline} metabolism between nature and human
intervention."95

Today [the notion that human beings can be conceived apart from their
wider environment has been]{.underline} shown to be [one of the most
fatal errors in the long history of humanity. The return to a
dialectical perspective on humanity and nature, traceable]{.underline}
back [to]{.underline} the ancient Greeks and the notion of Airs Waters
Places, and preserved and enhanced over millennia in the work of
[materialist, socialist, and ecological thinkers, is an existential
requirement of living ecologically in the Anthropocene in a world beyond
capital.]{.underline}

It is common today to recognize that [climate change represents a
"global existential threat"]{.underline} that places in jeopardy the
very survival of humanity. Today we are faced with a situation in which
the [continual expansion of capitalism based on]{.underline} the
[burning]{.underline} of ever larger amounts of [fossil
fuels]{.underline} [points to the]{.underline} possibility---even
[probability, if the system of production is not altered
radically]{.underline} in a matter of decades---[of the downfall
of]{.underline} industrial [civilization]{.underline},
[placing]{.underline} the [survival of humanity in
question.]{.underline} This is the meaning of environmental exterminism
in our time. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), net zero carbon dioxide emissions must be reached by 2050
if the world is to have a reasonable hope of keeping global average
temperatures below a 1.5°C, or even a 2°C, increase over preindustrial
levels. Not to accomplish this is to invite the devastation of the earth
as a safe home for humanity and innumerable other species.

[Climate change is part of a]{.underline} more general [planetary
ecological crisis associated with the crossing of planetary
boundaries]{.underline} in general, [including]{.underline}
those---beyond climate change itself---related to [species
extinction]{.underline}, stratospheric [ozone depletion, ocean
acidification, disruption of]{.underline} the [nitrogen and phosphorous
cycles, loss of]{.underline} ground cover/[forests, declining fresh
water]{.underline} sources associated with desertification[, atmospheric
aerosol loading, and]{.underline} the introduction of novel entities
(new synthetic chemicals and new genetic forms).52 To this should be
added the [emergence of new zoonoses, as in]{.underline} the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic, resulting principally
[from]{.underline} the [agribusiness transformation of]{.underline} the
[human relation to the environment]{.underline}.53

Yet, there is no doubt that climate change is at the center of the
current global ecological crisis. Like nuclear winter, it poses a threat
to civilization and the continuation of the human species itself. Even
now, the [IPCC tells us]{.underline} in its most recent reports
(2021--22) on the physical science of [climate change]{.underline} and
its [impacts]{.underline} that the most optimistic scenario, though
warding off irreversible climate change, [is]{.underline} still one [of
growing global catastrophe]{.underline} in the decades ahead, [and
requires immediate action to protect]{.underline} the
[lives]{.underline} and living conditions of hundreds [of]{.underline}
millions, and perhaps [billions]{.underline}, of people [who will be
exposed to extreme weather]{.underline} events of a kind that global
civilization has never seen before.54 [To counter this requires the
greatest movement of workers and peoples]{.underline} the world has ever
seen in order [to restore]{.underline} the [conditions of their
existence]{.underline}, which have been usurped by the regime of
capital, [and]{.underline} to [reestablish an ecologically sustainable
world rooted in substantive equality.]{.underline}55

Ironically, the latest IPCC report, which was meant to draw world
attention to the catastrophic nature of today's climate crisis and the
rapidly worsening prospects for humanity if revolutionary-scale changes
are not made, was published on February 28, 2022, four days after the
Russian entry into the Ukrainian Civil War in defiance of NATO,
resulting in growing concern over the possibility of a global
thermonuclear exchange. Hence, the world's attention was drawn away from
considering one global existential threat, endangering all of humanity,
namely carbon omnicide, by the sudden reemergence of another, nuclear
omnicide.

Still, even as the world turned its attention to [the possibility of war
between the leading nuclear powers]{.underline}, [the full planetary
scale of the nuclear threat,]{.underline} as understood by science in
terms of nuclear winter, was absent from the picture. [Global warming
and nuclear winter]{.underline}, though arising in different ways, [are
closely connected in climate terms, demonstrating]{.underline} that [the
world is on the brink of destroying most]{.underline} of the
[inhabitants of]{.underline} the [earth]{.underline}, in one direction
or another: [global warming over decades leading to a point of no return
for humanity]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the [death of hundreds of
millions by nuclear fire, followed by]{.underline} global
[cooling]{.underline} in days and months, [exterminating]{.underline}
most of [the rest of the]{.underline} world's [population through
starvation]{.underline}. Just as the [full destructive implications
of]{.underline} [climate change]{.underline} threatening the very
existence of humanity [are]{.underline} in large part [denied
by]{.underline} the [powers]{.underline} that be, [so are]{.underline}
the full planetary [effects of]{.underline} nuclear war, which
scientific research into nuclear winter [tells us will]{.underline}
effectively [annihilate the population of every continent]{.underline}
on Earth.56

Today [we are confronted with a choice between exterminism and the human
ecological imperative.]{.underline}57 [The causal agent in the two
global existential crises]{.underline} now threatening the human species
[is capitalism and its irrational quest for exponentially increasing
capital accumulation and imperial power in a limited global
environment.]{.underline} [The only possible response to this unlimited
threat is a universal revolutionary movement rooted in]{.underline} both
[ecology and peace]{.underline}, turning away from the current
systematic destruction of the earth and its inhabitants, and providing
as its alternative a world of substantive equality and ecological
sustainability, [namely socialism]{.underline}.

### Impact -- captialogenic health issues 

#### Impacts of capitalism creates capitalogenic health issues 

#### Singh and Hickel, Centre for Public Policy Research and Johns Hopkins University 23

Accessed 7-7-2025, HDSCW-JX\]

This list is intended to be illustrative; it is neither exhaustive nor
systematic. Crucially, we are not arguing that all social or structural
determinants of disease are capitalogenic, or that improvements in
health outcomes have not been achieved within capitalism, or that
capitalism is the only cause of the diseases we have listed above. Other
political-economic arrangements may also produce ill health and health
inequalities. [But in cases where diseases are perpetuated or
exacerbated by specifically capitalist relations of production
(profit/growth orientation, restrictive patent regimens, artificial
scarcities of essential goods, labour-related abuses and insecurities,
hierarchies of exploitation, etc) we must be able to identify and
understand these dynamics and respond appropriately]{.underline}.

We have focused here on contemporary health crises, but [the concept of
capitalogenic disease also helps us understand long-term trends in
health indicators]{.underline}. Researchers have shown that the
expansion of the capitalist world-system from the 16th century was
associated with a prolonged deterioration in health indicators (welfare
ratios, stature and mortality), on a scale unprecedented in human
history, including through atrocities such as the European enclosures,
the genocide of Indigenous Americans, the mass enslavement of Africans,
policy-induced famines in India and so
on.[^41^](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10729074/#R41) In
some cases, social indicators have still not recovered. Where progress
has been achieved, it began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
with the rise of democratic, socialist and other progressive political
movements that established public provisioning systems, redistributed
incomes, regulated capital and organised production more around human
needs and social
outcomes.[^42--45^](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10729074/#R42) [Understanding
these dynamics of capital and resistance allows us to situate
contemporary health challenges in broader historical
perspective.]{.underline}

Medicine as a discipline prides itself on scientific objectivity.
However[, the science of medicine can only ever be as robust as its
understanding of the social contexts in which disease
occurs.]{.underline} [Research on social determinants has usefully
broadened the medical focus from 'proximal' factors to the more 'distal'
structural causes]{.underline}. And yet consensus around the reality of
social determinants has so far yielded little by way of substantive
change. Why? It may be in part because the distal causes and mechanisms
remain underspecified and depoliticised.

[It is a basic principle of medical science that before diseases can be
properly cured or otherwise addressed, they must be named and
understood]{.underline}. Language plays a crucial role here. [The
concept of capitalogenic disease enables us to think about social
determinants in more specific ways,]{.underline} with a more precise
aetiology and pathogenesis. It helps us to understand how various health
crises are created, and how they are connected, and empowers us to
address them. Following others who have sought to link disease within
bodies to injustices outside them, the concept concretises for
researchers and health professionals how an apparently abstract economic
system has real-world effects on bodies and lives.

### Impact -- inequality

During the last few decades, we are told, **[inequality has grown in a
way that is unprecedented.]{.underline}** **[Not only have the fortunes
of a few skyrocketed, but they have also been accruing to an ever
smaller fraction of the population]{.underline}** (0.1%). The income of
the rich as a multiple of that of the working people has gone up to
astronomical levels, not seen in more than a century. Moreover, for the
first time since the Great Depression, the wealth and income of the
people below the top few percent is said to have been stagnant or
diminishing over the last 40 years, and **[young people no longer expect
to have the same or higher standard of living as their parents. The
cause of all this]{.underline}**, we are often told, **[is
the]{.underline}** unbridled **[development of]{.underline}** neoliberal
**[capitalism and its capture of the political system in the United
States.]{.underline}** The new wealth of the few is said to be in large
part a "rent4" from monopolistic control of economic life, unprecedented
state-enabled growth of corporate behemoths, and the destruction of the
power of labor through globalization, with its huge offshoring of
industrial production, and the consequent (as well as state-supported)
demise of the unions. Inequality is not only systemic, we are told, it
is also largely hereditary. Indeed, the intergenerational conveyance of
**[inequality is]{.underline}** said to be
**[accomplished]{.underline}** these days not just
**[through]{.underline}** inheritance law, but also (perhaps mainly)
through pervasive **[lifetime transfers via educational privilege,
social connections, and an increasingly corrupting role of money in the
social and political spheres.]{.underline}** No surprise, then, that the
long-disfavored word socialism has reappeared in American political
vocabulary. This is not just a sign that McCarthyism no longer frightens
people aspiring to political office. **[It is also a clear call
for]{.underline}** more state intervention in economic and social life,
designed to **[restructure and reform]{.underline}** the whole economic
base **[of the American society and to assure a more just distribution
of the national wealth. Democracy is no longer just a political
concept---it is also increasingly seen as an economic
desideratum.]{.underline}**

Of course, the global division of labor has changed since the late
nineteenth century. Many of the leading industries of that time,
including textiles, steel, and assembly line processes, have now been
outsourced to low-wage peripheral economies like India and China, while
the core states have moved to innovation activities, high-technology
aerospace and biotech engineering, information technology, and
capital-intensive
agriculture.[^25^](https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/capitalism-global-poverty-and-the-case-for-democratic-socialism/#en25)
[Yet still the basic problem remains.]{.underline} **[Under neoliberal
globalization]{.underline}** (structural adjustment programs and WTO
rules), **[governments in the periphery are generally precluded from
using tariffs, subsidies, and other forms of industrial policy to
achieve meaningful development and economic sovereignty, while labor
market deregulation and global labor arbitrage have kept wages extremely
low.]{.underline}** In this context, [the drive to maximize profit
leads]{.underline} Southern [capitalists and foreign investors to pour
resources into relatively low-technology export sectors, at the expense
of more modern lines of industry.]{.underline}

Moreover, [for those parts of the periphery that occupy the lowest rungs
in global commodity chains, **production continues to be organized along
so-called pre-modern lines,** even under the new division of labor. **In
the Congo**, for instance, **workers are sent into dangerous mineshafts
without any modern safety equipment,** tunneling deep into the ground
with nothing but shovels, **often coerced at gunpoint by U.S.-backed
militias, so that Microsoft and Apple can secure cheap coltan for their
electronics
devices.**]{.underline}[^26^](https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/capitalism-global-poverty-and-the-case-for-democratic-socialism/#en26)
[**Pre-modern production processes predicated on** the "technology" of
**labor coercion are also found in the cocoa plantations of Ghana and
Côte d'Ivoire, where enslaved children labor in brutal conditions for
corporations** like Cadbury, or Colombia's banana export sector, **where
a hyper-exploited peasantry is kept in line by a regime of rural terror
and extrajudicial killings overseen by private death
squads.**]{.underline}[**^27^**](https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/capitalism-global-poverty-and-the-case-for-democratic-socialism/#en27)

[Uneven global development, including the endurance of ostensibly
"feudal" relations of production, is not inevitable. It is an effect of
capitalist dynamics]{.underline}. **[Capitalists in the periphery find
it more *profitable* to employ cheap labor subject to conditions of
slavery or other forms of coercion than they do to invest in modern
industry.]{.underline}**

[The crisis is everywhere and it threatens our life: new wars all the
time, with the potential to turn into a world war at any moment; climate
change, species extinction, and the breakdown of nature's metabolic
cycles; growing social inequality, homelessness, and poverty; the spread
of racism]{.underline} and the seemingly ineluctable rise of the far
right\... All while it is becoming ever more obvious that this
catastrophic development is inextricably [linked with]{.underline} our
economic and social system --- [capitalism]{.underline}.

The links are plain to see: [if all areas of life are subordinated to
ruthless market competition, it's only logical that groups, classes, and
states are willing to also assert their interests through overt violence
and war,]{.underline} if necessary. [When the entire economic system
rests on a built-in growth imperative, it is only logical that every
area of nature and life should be required to "generate
value",]{.underline} or in other words: to be transformed into a
commodity. When the amassing of private wealth is the most important
principle of action in a society, [social inequality and the
contradictions between classes must grow]{.underline}, since profits
increase when the portion reserved for wages falls. [And ultimately,
racism and fascism are almost unavoidable in a world in which the market
rules.]{.underline} Or, as the Black abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore
(2007: 243) puts it: "In the contemporary world, racism is the ordinary
means through which dehumanization achieves ideological normality."
[Wherever class oppositions emerge, racism and fascism are never far
away,]{.underline} [since the dehumanization and super-exploitation of
the poor have to be legitimated somehow if domination is to remain
stable.]{.underline}

[Putting an end to the crises of the present would require forms of
cooperation that transcend state and ethnic boundaries. This is the only
way to stop wars, prevent the collapse of ecological systems, reduce the
global consumption of resources, and halt the immiseration of a
significant portion of the world's population. But this is precisely
what capitalism cannot do]{.underline} --- solidarity and cooperation
are not its speciality. [It is based on]{.underline} competition and
profit maximization, [implacable rivalries between individuals and
nation states,]{.underline} the transformation of nature into value,
[and the exploitation of human beings.]{.underline} It fuels precisely
that atmosphere of civil war that makes us all so afraid: ["all against
all, everyone for themselves".]{.underline}

[Capitalism emerged as a modern world economic system in the 1400s with
European colonial expansion.]{.underline} The Portuguese, Spanish,
Dutch, English, and other nations invaded foreign territories and seized
their land. T[hey turned the land into a commodity to exploit and
generate wealth. Colonizers relied on the enslavement of Native
Americans and Africans because unfree labor guaranteed the highest
profits. They]{.underline} also used indentured servitude and contract
labor, which f[orced people to work for years without pay.]{.underline}
Women made up a significant part of this workforce. [This violent
process allowed colonizers to accumulate immense wealth for their
empires. Slavery financed a wide range of economic
activity,]{.underline} such as shipbuilding, railroads, banking,
insurance, new forms of commerce, the rise of manufacturing and
industrialization. [European colonizers justified conquest and the
imposition of capitalism with the claim that they were racially superior
and divinely sanctioned to rule. Colonizers divided the world between
superior and inferior people]{.underline} --- civilized vs savage,
Christian vs heathen, male vs female, white vs Black, and rich vs poor,
etc. [This worldview became entrenched in capitalism. Colonialism
imposed this world view around the globe.]{.underline} Today capitalism
continues to perpetuate white supremacy, patriarchy, colonialism,
imperialism, and other forms of oppression. It also perpetuates a global
division of labor. For example, the nations from the Global South are
rich in resources, but the poor do not control the wealth that is
generated from those resources. Instead, they are often forced to
migrate to work in wealthier nations. Keeping domestic labor unpaid or
very low-wage has been central to this system of capital accumulation.
Domestic workers have been among the most exploited under capitalism.
But they and their children have also formed some of the most visionary
movements for freedom. Their liberation can challenge the entire system
of oppression and exploitation upon which capitalism is based.

'[Capitalist realism']{.underline} is a term popularised by the late
political theorist Mark Fisher in a provocative and unsettling book by
that name (Fisher, 2009). The term [implies]{.underline} that, ever
since the fall of Soviet Communism in 1989, [capitalism has been the
only game in town; the only realistic system of production and
distribution to structure globalised human society. Everything else is
sheer utopianism in the pejorative sense -- naïve dreaming of what can
never be.]{.underline}

A phrase that has almost become a cliché, capitalist realism points to a
failure of imagination, suggesting that [it is now easier to imagine the
end of the world than the end of capitalism]{.underline}. As one looks
around the world today, the case for capitalist realism is, admittedly,
disturbingly persuasive -- as Fisher himself was the first to admit,
even as he resisted it. It can tempt one to despair, for it often seems
that there is in fact no realistic alternative to what we know today.

I confess, however, that [I have never subscribed to capitalist realism,
even though it is clear that capitalist realism is real.]{.underline} To
say that it is real is to acknowledge the zeitgeist of the twenty-first
century, one shared not only by neoliberal conservatives but also by
most on the green-left who, despite a 'progressive' self-image, remain
insidiously entrenched in capitalism's growth paradigm. In Fisher's
words, [there is 'a widespread sense that not only is capitalism the
only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now
impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it']{.underline}
(Fisher, 2009: 2). [He describes this consciousness as a 'pervasive
atmosphere' that conditions 'not only the production of culture but also
the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of
**invisible barrier constraining thought and action'**]{.underline}
(Fisher, 2009: 16).

But here is the disturbing paradox of capitalist realism: just as the
dominant cultural imagination has contracted into a singularity of
vision -- there is no alternative to capitalism! -- the very system to
which there is apparently no alternative shows itself to be in the
process of self-destructing, like a cancer cell growing itself to death,
killing its host.

[In other words, capitalist realism is unrealistic, non-viable, a dead
end -- literally.]{.underline} **[The system is full of internal
contradictions that the system cannot resolve,]{.underline}** most
notably the myth that through market mechanisms we can purchase and
consume our way to sustainability. At the very hour when modern humanity
has arrived at a self-aggrandising pinnacle of triumph -- a global
market economy promising riches for all -- [the skies have been darkened
by the terrible spectres of ecological degradation and social decline
and polarisation.]{.underline} The **[climate emergency]{.underline}**
is only one of these storm clouds, but this alone has the potential to
lay waste to our species, as well as most others.

At the same time, **[vast oceans of debilitating poverty surround small
oceans of unfathomable plenty, exposing the violent betrayal of the
capitalist growth agenda]{.underline}**, euphemistically (or just
deceptively) known in public discourse as 'sustainable development'.
**[This is a race leading towards an abyss, both enabled and entrenched
by a sterility of imagination called capitalist realism.]{.underline}**
Fortunately -- if that is the right word -- [capitalist realism 'can
only be threatened if it is shown to be in some way inconsistent or
untenable; if, that is to say, capitalism's ostensible "realism" turns
out to be nothing of the sort']{.underline} (Fisher, 2009: 16).

Of course, as history relates, capitalism is a dexterous beast, always
shifting and changing with the times to exploit new opportunities for
profit and in response to new challenges to its legitimacy.
Nevertheless, [the overlapping range of ecological, social, financial,
and health crises indicate that, one way or another, coming years and
decades will see growing pressure on the global capitalist system and
the emergence of new political and economic forms and
imaginaries.]{.underline} As crises intensify, [a rupture of some form
lies ahead, with overlapping ecological, technological, and social
realties destined to disrupt (are already disrupting) the status
quo.]{.underline} The pandemic is just one more nail in the coffin of
late-stage capitalism. The human challenge is to ensure that the
post-capitalist era emerges as far as possible through design rather
than disaster, acknowledging all the while that self-determination is a
luxury not available to everyone, particularly those facing the violence
of and on capitalism's new frontiers.

This book -- indeed, all my work -- situates itself beyond capitalist
realism. I **[reject capitalist realism as unrealistic, as an artefact
of false consciousness; as false consciousness itself,]{.underline}**
blind **[to its ecocidal nature.]{.underline}** Technology cannot save
necro-capitalism from its cannibalistic nature nor will the so-called
'trickle down' effect resolve the deep injustices of its colonial and
patriarchal past and present. And no Green New Deal will contribute much
to a 'just transition' if it remains hooked onto an extractivist
economics of growth which a finite planet evidently cannot bear.

[Thinking and acting 'beyond capitalism' is not easy in a
one-dimensional world that is increasingly homogenised, commodified, and
standardised.]{.underline} Yet, **[breaking through the cracks of
capitalism to think otherwise and be otherwise is more essential now
than ever.]{.underline}** In the words of Herman Hesse: **['Nothing is
harder, yet nothing is more necessary, than to speak of certain things
whose existence is neither demonstrable nor probable. The very fact that
serious and conscientious people treat them as existing things brings
them a step closer to existence and to the possibility of being
born']{.underline}** (Hesse, 1980).

[Ecosocialism embodies the premise that both humans and nature have a
common enemy in capitalism (Stache, 2019). As such, ecosocialism aims to
respond directly to the social and ecological crises and injustices of
capitalism. While strategies to realize this are lacking, core
principles are repeated throughout the literature that most ecosocialist
diverges agree on; (1) the means of production being democratically
planned and collectively owned (Albert, 2023; Park, 2013), effectively
removing class stratifications (Stache, 2019) and the commodification of
labor (Johns et al., 2003), (2) prioritizing use-value over
exchange-value]{.underline} (Albert, 2023; Johns et al., 2003), (3)
[decreasing energy and material consumption in the Global North (Albert,
2023), and (4) simultaneously redistributing resources to the Global
South]{.underline} (Albert, 2023). The objective of realizing such
principles is to create a way of life for all humans that provides a
good standard of living while ideologically situating humans within the
ecological system and thus striking a balance between nature and humans
(Stache, 2019; Lalander & Lembke, 2018). According to Stache (2019),
this can be established by adopting a needs-based economy and a culture
of cooperation, both of which are echoed in all four principles[. The
challenge with establishing such an objective is that it requires "a
transformation of revolutionary proportions"]{.underline} (Stache, 2019,
p. [143). Such a revolution would need to be democratically realized via
a socialist and counterhegemonic movement or organization, likely
involving temporary reforms that connect with everyday politics (Stache,
2019). In order to realize an ecosocialist]{.underline} [transformation
and establish ongoing sustainability, the efficient utilization and
further creation of technologies compatible with ecosocialist
sustainability]{.underline} principles (Stache, 2019) is imperative and
constitutes an additional obstacle. Just as Stache (2019) highlights the
need for a revolution, Lalander and Lembke (2018) speak of the need for
a collective critique of development as a first step in acknowledging a
need for an ecologically integrated social system. Imperatively, this
involves both material transformations and a cultural shift, ensuring
that collective needs are met rather than being driven by the pursuit of
endless accumulation (Lalander and Lembke, 2018). While cultural mindset
shifts are crucial, they must be accompanied by concrete structural
changes, such as reclaiming commons, redefining ownership and promoting
ecological stewardship, democratic socio-ecological and economic
planning, and post-capitalist governance mechanisms (cf. Hosseini, 2023,
Kovel, 2014). As such, ecosocialism ideology is in stark contrast to
capitalism ideology and this constitutes the overarching obstacle we
face as a collective in achieving ecosocialism. The imperative to
strategize becomes more apparent. Albert (2023) argues that strategies
for transformation in the ecosocialist movement are severely lacking and
that by pre-emptively analyzing such strategies for transformation,
ideal transition pathways and the anticipation of potential crises can
be realized, ultimately giving ecosocialism a chance to be implemented.
The scope of ecosocialism demonstrates its strengths and weaknesses.

The weaknesses of ecosocialism relate to its requirements for a shift in
mindset, its claims to fully address the structural problems of
capitalism, as well as the lack of strategy for transitioning from a
capitalist system. Many ecosocialists speak to Indigenous knowledges and
structures for acting as catalysts and/or examples of ecosocialism
(Kovel, 2014; Lalander & Lembke, 2018; Stache, 2019). However, Kovel
(2014) notes the difficulty of instilling Indigenous ways of thinking
into the collective, which is further compounded if the presence of
Indigenous cultures has been suppressed by capitalist domination. In
contrast, concerns about romanticizing Indigenous movements have also
been raised (Stache, 2019), and it's important to acknowledge the risk
of appropriating or oversimplifying such movements and to respect the
autonomy of the peoples, traditions, and ideologies. While Indigenous
ways of thinking can instill ecosocialist ideology, specifically with
regard to ecology, it is the political and economic forces that favor
capitalist ideology that pose the biggest obstacle. [Ecosocialism aims
to combat the structural problems of capitalism, and to this degree,
there are doubts that economic descaling, consumption reduction, and
political devolution, as idealized in ecosocialism, would result in
ideal social conditions for an ecologically sustainable and]{.underline}
socially just society (park, 2013). Examples of this are whether
descaled economic communities will have the means to gather resources to
develop and effectively utilize eco-friendly technologies (Park, 2013),
and localism strategies compound this, raising questions around the
scarcity of natural resources and equality issues for areas that lack
essential resources (Park, 2013). [Echoing this are questions about
whether socialist alternatives are capable of only minimizing structural
problems in comparison to capitalism, rather than entirely combating
them (Johns et al.,]{.underline} 2003). For example, Johns et al (2003)
ask whether it's possible to extract what billions of people need or
want without some form of social hierarchy and ecological exploitation
that renders environments less balanced than they would be otherwise.
Lastly, [the detailed strategic planning for ideal trajectories of
transition from current (neoliberal) capitalism to ecosocialism is
lacking, leaving questions around the tangible step-by-step actions
required and ultimately decreasing the likelihood of implementation. In
reference to this, it can be argued that rather than negate the
feasibility of ecosocialism, such weaknesses instead act as obstacles;
growing awareness and education around climate change and social justice
issues due to social media means a collective shift in mindset regarding
politics and economics is already growing (e.g. use-value over
exchange-value is the premise of 'opportunity' shops which have been
growing in popularity) and need only be enhanced; concerns for
ecosocialism's capacity to address structural problems do not negate the
massive progress that would be realized via its implementation, and
lastly, strategic deficiency can be remedied if ecosocialists come
together to formulate trajectories and plans of action]{.underline}.

[Science has established without a doubt that]{.underline}, in today's
"full-world economy," [it is necessary to operate within an overall
Earth System budget with respect to allowable physical
throughput]{.underline}.3 However, rather than constituting an
insurmountable obstacle to human development, this can be seen as
initiating a whole new stage of ecological civilization based on the
creation of a society of substantive equality and ecological
sustainability, or ecosocialism. [Degrowth]{.underline}, in this sense,
[is not aimed at austerity]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} at [finding a
"prosperous way down" from]{.underline} our current [extractivist,
wasteful, ecologically unsustainable, maldeveloped, exploitative, and
unequal, class-hierarchical world]{.underline}.4 [Continued growth would
occur in]{.underline} [some areas]{.underline} of the economy, [made
possible by reductions elsewhere. Spending on fossil fuels, armaments,
private jets, sport utility vehicles, second homes, and advertising
would need to be cut in]{.underline} order [to provide room for growth
in]{.underline} such areas as [regenerative agriculture, food
production, decent housing, clean energy, accessible health
care]{.underline}, universal [education, community welfare, public
transportation, digital connectivity, and]{.underline} other areas
related to [green production and social needs]{.underline}.5

When the first systems of national income accounting were devised at the
time of the Second World War, all increases in national income,
regardless of source, were characterized as constituting economic
growth. Gross Domestic Product, or [GDP]{.underline}, [became the
primary measure of human progress]{.underline}.6 Nevertheless, much of
this was questionable from a wider social and ecological standpoint.
According to the prevailing system of national economic accounting,
[anything that provides "value added," in accordance with the capitalist
valorization process, represents "growth." This includes]{.underline}
such things as [war spending]{.underline}; the [production
of]{.underline} wasteful and [toxic products]{.underline}; [luxury
consumption]{.underline} by the very rich; marketing (encompassing
motivation research, targeting, advertising, and sales promotion);
replacements of social by private consumption, as in the [substitution
of the private automobile for public transportation]{.underline};
[expropriation of the commons; business expenditures to
enhance]{.underline} the [exploitation of workers; legal costs related
to]{.underline} the [administration, control, and enhancement of private
property; anti-union activities by corporate management; the so-called
criminal justice system; rising pharmaceutical and insurance costs;
financial sector employment; military spending; and even criminal
activities.]{.underline}7 [Maximum extraction of natural resources is
seen as crucial for rapid economic growth]{.underline}, since it draws
on nature's "free gift...to capital."8

In contrast, [nonmarket and subsistence production]{.underline} carried
out throughout the world; domestic labor mainly performed by women;
numerous expenditures for human growth and development (seen as
relatively nonproductive); conservation of the environment; and
reductions in the toxicity of production [were]{.underline} all seen as
["counting for nothing" or assigned a diminished worth, since they do
not enhance productivity or directly promote economic
value]{.underline}.9

Today the elemental tragedy of this is all around us. It is now widely
perceived that [economic growth, based on nonstop capital accumulation,
is the main cause of the destruction of the earth as a safe place for
humanity]{.underline}. The Earth System crisis is [evident in the
crossing of planetary boundaries related to climate change, ocean
acidification, destruction of the ozone layer, species extinction,
disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, loss of
groundcover]{.underline} (including forests), [depletion of fresh water,
aerosol loading, and novel entities]{.underline} ([such as synthetic
chemicals, nuclear radiation, and genetically modified
organisms]{.underline}).10 The drive to capital accumulation is thus
generating a "habitability crisis" for humanity in this century.11

The world scientific consensus, as represented by the UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline}), has
[established]{.underline} that the [global average temperature needs to
be kept below a 1.5°C increase]{.underline} over pre-industrial levels
this century---or else, with a disproportionately higher level of risk,
"well below" a 2°C increase---[if climate destabilization is not to
threaten absolute catastrophe as positive feedback mechanisms come into
effect]{.underline}. In the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report
([AR6]{.underline}, released in its various parts over 2021--23), [the
most optimistic scenario is]{.underline} one of an end-of-the-century
increase in global average temperature over pre-industrial levels of
below 1.5°C. This requires that the 1.5°C boundary not be crossed until
2040, rising by a tenth of a degree to 1.6°C, and then falling near the
end of the century back down to a 1.4°C increase. All of this [is
predicated on reaching net zero]{.underline} (in fact, real zero)
[carbon emissions by 2050, which gives a fifty-fifty chance that the
climate-temperature boundary will not be exceeded.]{.underline}12

Yet, [according to leading climate scientist]{.underline} Kevin
[Anderson of the Tyndall Center]{.underline} for Climate Change
Research, [this scenario is already out of date]{.underline}. [It is now
necessary]{.underline}, based on the IPCC's own figures, [to reach the
zero-carbon dioxide emissions point by 2040]{.underline}, in order [to
have the same 50 percent chance of avoiding a 1.5°C
increase.]{.underline} "Starting now," Anderson wrote in March 2023,

> to not exceed 1.5°C of warming requires 11% year-on-year cuts in
> emissions, falling to nearer 5% for 2°C. However, these global average
> rates ignore the core concept of equity, central to all UN climate
> negotiations, which gives "developing country parties" a little longer
> to decarbonise. Include equity and most "developed" nations need to
> reach zero CO2 emissions between 2030 and 2035, with developing
> nations following suit up to a decade later. [Any delay will shrink
> these timelines still further.]{.underline}13

The [World Meteorological Organization indicated]{.underline} in May
2023 that [there is a 66 percent chance]{.underline} that the annual
average near-surface [global temperature will]{.underline} temporarily
[exceed a 1.5°C]{.underline} increase over pre-industrial levels during
["at least" one year by 2027]{.underline}.14

[Existing IPCC scenarios are part of a conservative process, designed to
conform to the prerequisites of the capitalist economy, which builds
continued economic growth]{.underline} in the wealthy countries [into
all scenarios]{.underline} [while excluding any substantial changes in
social relations. The sole device relied upon in]{.underline} such
[climate modeling is to assume price-induced shifts in
technology]{.underline}. [Existing scenarios]{.underline} thus
necessarily [rely heavily on negative emissions
technologies]{.underline}, [such as Bioenergy and Carbon Capture and
Sequestration (BECCS) and Direct Carbon Air Capture (DAC), that do not
presently exist at scale and cannot be instituted within the prescribed
timeline]{.underline}, [while also presenting enormous ecological
hazards in themselves]{.underline}. This emphasis on essentially
nonexistent technologies that are themselves environmentally destructive
(given their enormous land, water, and energy requirements) has been
challenged by scientists within the IPCC itself. Thus, [in the original
Summary for Policymakers]{.underline} for the mitigation report, part 3
of AR6, the [scientists authoring the report agreed]{.underline} that
[such technologies are not viable in a reasonable time frame and
suggested that low-energy solutions based on popular
mobilization]{.underline} might [offer the best hope of]{.underline}
carrying out the massive [ecological transformations]{.underline} now
required. All of [this]{.underline}, however, [was excluded from the
final published Summary]{.underline} for Policymakers as determined by
governments, [as part of the normal IPCC process, which allows for
censorship of the scientists.]{.underline}15

Price-induced technological solutions, which would allow continued
economic growth and the perpetuation of current social relations, do not
exist on anything like the required scale and tempo. Hence, [major
socioeconomic changes in the mode of production and consumption are
needed, running counter to the reigning political-economic
hegemony.]{.underline} "Three decades of complacency," Anderson writes,
"has meant that technology on its own cannot now cut emissions fast
enough." There is thus a drastic need for low-energy solutions based on
changes in relations of production and consumption that also address
deep inequalities. [The necessary reductions in emissions are "only
possible by re-allocating society's productive capacity away from
enabling the private luxury of a few and austerity for everyone else,
and toward wider public prosperity and private sufficiency]{.underline}.
For most people, tackling climate change will bring multiple benefits,
from affordable housing to secure employment. But for those few of us
who have disproportionately benefited from the status quo," Anderson
insists, "it means a profound reduction in how much energy we use and
stuff we accumulate."16

What is objectively necessary at this point in human history is
therefore a revolutionary transformation in social relations governing
production, consumption, and distribution. This means a dramatic shift
away from the system of monopoly capital, exploitation, expropriation,
waste, and the endless drive to accumulation.114 In its place, [a
revolutionary humanity based in the working population]{.underline}---an
emergent environmental proletariat---[will need to demand a new social
formation that provides for the basic needs of all of the population,
followed by community needs, including the developmental needs of all
individuals]{.underline}.115 [This will be made possible by qualitative
improvements in work]{.underline}, [an emphasis on useful labor and care
work, along with the sharing of abundant social wealth, itself the
product of human labor.]{.underline} A sustainable relation to the earth
is an absolute requirement without which there can be no human future.
All of [this necessitates going against the logic of capitalist
accumulation in the present]{.underline}. [Economic planning will need
to be repurposed, not for economic growth or war]{.underline} on other
countries, [but in order to create a new set of social priorities aimed
at human flourishing and a sustainable social metabolism with the
earth]{.underline}.

A "socialist vision of the United States," Harry Magdoff wrote in 1995,
would require decreases in the use of energy, production of civilian
cars, and government subsidies to environmentally destructive firms. "A
much simpler lifestyle would be needed in the rich countries for the
sake of preserving the earth as a place of human existence." In order
[to achieve this, "growth would need to be curtailed or controlled." It
would be essential in such a system to focus on basic needs, such as
adequate and dignified housing for all.]{.underline} [War spending
geared to imperialism would have to cease and immigration restrictions
would need to be eliminated.]{.underline} [All of this requires social
and economic planning. None of it could be achieved by relying primarily
on the system of market prices, which invariably promotes inequality,
environmental destruction, war, and exclusion]{.underline}.116 As
British sociologist Anthony Giddens wrote in The Politics of Climate
Change, "planning of some sort is inevitable" in the face of the current
planetary crisis.117

In the United States and other rich countries, [the means already exist
at present for such a massive, qualitative transformation of society in
line with social priorities and the needs of the oppressed working
class, while shifting away from imperialism and the global oppression of
"the wretched of the earth."]{.underline} This can be easily seen by
pointing to [the now trillion-dollar military budget]{.underline}, which
[could be repurposed to carry out those changes in the energy
infrastructure necessary for human survival]{.underline}. But it can
also be seen in the [rising levels of expropriation of surplus from the
direct producers.]{.underline} A study by RAND Corporation estimated
that [\$47 trillion (in 2018 dollars]{.underline}) [was expropriated
from the bottom 90 percent of the U.S. population]{.underline} between
1980 and 2018, calculated based on what they would have received if
income had grown equitably within the economy over the period. [This
exceeds the entire current value of the U.S. housing stock,]{.underline}
which in January 2022 was \$43 trillion dollars.118 [At the base of this
enormous social surplus is social labor, which needs to be allocated on
an economic and ecological basis, and no longer on the basis of private
accumulation]{.underline}.119

Even the most cursory examination of the wider waste and exploitation in
the system raises what Morris called the problem of "Useful work versus
Useless Toil."120 [The massive economic surplus arising from social
labor]{.underline}---measured not simply by profits, interest, and rent,
but also the waste, maldistribution, and elementary irrationality of the
system---[is already many times that which is necessary to carry out the
vast changes needed to create a society of sustainable human
development]{.underline}. [It is capitalism itself that imposes scarcity
and austerity on the population]{.underline} in order [to compel workers
to sacrifice their lives still further for an exploitative system, now
threatening a planetary habitability crisis for all of humanity along
with innumerable other life forms]{.underline}.

Society for the Preservation of Nature]{.underline}, largely [led by
scientists, had thirty-seven million members]{.underline} by 1987,
making it the largest conservation advocacy organization in the world.99

[As the Soviet Union]{.underline} [industrialized and
modernized]{.underline} while [facing the need for high levels of
military spending given the Cold War threat from the West, it naturally
converged with Western levels of environmental destruction. Like the
West, it eventually responded]{.underline}, [though not without
contradictions, to its environmental movements. Environmental protection
and conservation were incorporated]{.underline}, if inadequately, [into
its overall planning system]{.underline}. [The Soviet Union
had]{.underline} a very [extensive system of environmental
laws]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, however, [were insufficiently
enforced]{.underline}. It was [Soviet scientists]{.underline}, soon
followed by U.S. scientists, who [first raised the alarm on accelerated
global warming]{.underline}.100 [Major efforts were]{.underline} also
[made in the area of soil conservation]{.underline}.101 In the 1980s,
[the concept of "ecological civilization" first arose in the Soviet
Union and was soon to be adopted in China]{.underline}, where it has
become a core aspect of overall planning, as reflected in China's
five-year plans.102 Leading Soviet economists, such as P. G. Oldak,
argued for a radical transformation of Soviet national-income accounting
to integrate direct measures of environmental destruction. "'More,'" he
argued, "is by no means always 'better.'"103

The [Soviet Union's environmental record with]{.underline} respect to
[pollution]{.underline}, while hardly satisfactory, was generally
[favorable when compared to the United States, with roughly equal
populations]{.underline}. The Soviet Union's [per capita sulfur dioxide,
nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide emissions were all
far below those of the United States]{.underline}, while its per [capita
carbon dioxide emissions actually declined in its final
years]{.underline}. The [per capita ecological footprint]{.underline} of
the Soviet Union, [the most comprehensive measure of environmental
impact, was far lower than]{.underline} that of [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [with the gap increasing in the]{.underline}
[1980s]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} the [U.S. per capita ecological
footprint continued to grow while]{.underline} that of [the USSR leveled
off]{.underline}. Moreover, [this was true even though the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [was able "to offload
environmental harms on]{.underline} many [other countries." The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [was]{.underline} far
[wealthier]{.underline} and more technologically advanced,
[but]{.underline} also [did much more damage to the global
environment]{.underline}.104

[Although Soviet planning]{.underline} and that of other
postrevolutionary societies [had been directed at economic
growth]{.underline}, [mimicking capitalism to some extent in this
respect, the inner, class-based drive for capital accumulation is not an
inherent structural feature of a socialist, planned
society]{.underline}. For this reason, Paul M. Sweezy argued in 1989
that the actually existing [planned economies offered the best chance
for humanity in terms of the rapid transformations in production and
consumption needed to confront the global environmental
crisis]{.underline}.105

country can be rated highly on human development while having a low
ecological footprint. This is due to its placing human development for
the population as a whole, including environmental conditions, at the

The [demise of the Soviet Union and the opening up of China to the world
economy were universally greeted in the
West]{.underline}---[particularly within orthodox economics]{.underline}
as the ideological core of the system---[as offering definitive proof
that economic planning was unworkable and doomed to fail]{.underline}
from the start. [Socialism was identified entirely with planning, which,
it was said, led to inevitable failure]{.underline}. Implicit in this
was the "assumption that Soviet practice reveals the essential nature of
a centrally planned economy."88

However, [such]{.underline} a [blanket condemnation of central
planning]{.underline} in all forms and circumstances, [divorced from
concrete analysis, had no real theoretical basis, and was contradicted
by reality]{.underline}. [Capitalist economies]{.underline} had
themselves [frequently resorted to emergency wartime central
planning]{.underline}. [During the Second World War]{.underline}, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, for example,
[instituted]{.underline} an [extensive]{.underline} system of [national
planning, run by the War Production Board]{.underline} and other
agencies, [which shifted resources and production while instituting
rationing and price controls]{.underline}. Civilian automobile
production, constituting the core industrial sector of the country, was
rapidly converted into the production of armaments, tanks, and aircraft.
There was a desperate need to produce warships and merchant ships.
Military goods were needed not only for the United States but also for
its allies.89 This also demanded a massive expansion of and major shifts
in the labor force, as millions of men were drawn into military service.
Paid employment of women grew by 57 percent during the war; in 1943,
women made up 65 percent of the work force in the aircraft industry.90
All of [this required central planning, including planning agencies,
directives by the state, and fiscal and monetary controls]{.underline}.
[Government research in science and technology was boosted, most
famously in the Manhattan Project]{.underline}. The [economic
surplus]{.underline} generated by the society [was]{.underline}
massively [redirected to facilitate war production]{.underline}, while
[industry had to be coordinated to maximize]{.underline} specific
military [goods at the right time and tempo]{.underline}.91 Central
planning, as Michał Kalecki defined it, "embraces the volume of
production, the wage fund, larger investment projects, as well as
control over prices and the distribution of basic materials." U.S.
wartime planning fits this definition to a considerable extent,
demonstrating that a mixed economy was not incompatible in all
circumstances with centralized planning.92

[Without social and economic planning, the objectives of socialism aimed
at substantive equality and ecological sustainability are impossible to
achieve.]{.underline} [Logic and historical experience show]{.underline}
that [without a planning system of some sort operating at various
levels]{.underline}, [from workplace to local to national, there is no
conceivable way of effectively addressing the planetary ecological
emergency]{.underline} or ensuring "buen vivir for all people."93 This
simply cannot be achieved in a society of "Accumulate, accumulate! That
is Moses and the prophets!"94 [Planning]{.underline}, however, [needs to
be democratic if it is to attain socially optimal results]{.underline}.
"[There is nothing in central planning]{.underline}" in itself, Fred and
Harry Magdoff observed in "Approaching Socialism,"

[A unified, multifaceted planned economy, which would encompass multiple
levels and involve "whole-process democracy," does not
demand]{.underline} the [elimination of consumer markets or]{.underline}
of the [freedom of workers to work where they please]{.underline} (and
thus a labor market in this sense).96 [It does]{.underline}, however,
[require control over investment in capital goods and of
finance]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus [social controls allowing
for the mobilization of the economic surplus in ways that benefit the
population in its entirety]{.underline} (including future generations),

In his essay "In Defense of Socialist Planning" in 1986, Ernest Mandel
argued that [the main advantage of economic planning is that decisions
on allocation of resources and labor are made ex ante and then corrected
by trial and error, rather than ex post through the mediating force of
the commodity market]{.underline} (and its "rationing by the wallet").
[Planning]{.underline} thus [allows for decisions to be made directly on
the basis of]{.underline} what Marx called the "hierarchy
of...[needs]{.underline}." [This does not require]{.underline} that all
[decisions be made by a centralized bureaucracy; it is consistent with a
socialized democracy based on the "institutionalization of popular
sovereignty." The fundamental parameters of production would be
established by the associated producers in a society organized on the
principle of cooperation]{.underline}. [Such a society "would grow in
civilization rather than in mere consumption]{.underline}."97

By now, even capitalism under neoliberal modernization has discovered
what it calls the care sector. But [institutions of care are not run in
the common interest, but in the interests of profit.]{.underline} They
are transformed into a department of business, [where]{.underline}
people, overwhelmingly [women and mostly migrants, work under pitiful
conditions.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [the quality of care in hospitals,
kindergartens, and facilities for the elderly has tended to
worsen]{.underline}. In this regard, too, capitalism is oblivious to the
foundations of its own social existence.

[The socialist movement fights to have care work redistributed and
organized according to the common good]{.underline}. Facilities for
children, the ill, those who depend on care, and elders belong in public
or community ownership. [The people employed in them should be able to
work under good conditions and be well remunerated.]{.underline}

At the same time, it is imperative to redistribute reproductive
activities as between the genders. In this regard, two decades ago
socialist feminist Frigga Haug (2008) spoke about a "four-in-one
perspective". [Waged work, interpersonal care work, socio-political
engagement, and self-development should be understood as equally
important areas of activity, and all human beings should take
responsibility to an equal degree in all of these areas and have equal
opportunities for self-realization.]{.underline} The conditions for this
lie in the development of a public infrastructure of care, the
redistribution of wealth and work, and a feminist transformation of our
everyday behaviour.

In our view, an ["economy that puts life first" must proceed
towards]{.underline} a fivefold goal: 1) the provision to all human
beings --- meaning globally, irrespective of the framework of the
nation-state --- of the [goods they need to meet their everyday
needs]{.underline}; 2) the [establishment of public infrastructure that
guarantees]{.underline} comprehensive social security and [participation
in social life;]{.underline} this infrastructure should also not be
conceived according to nation-state limits, rather the goal must be to
expand existing international institutions for health and education to
form effective global infrastructure; 3) t[he sustainability of the mode
of production and life,]{.underline} meaning the alignment of economic
and social processes with the reproductive cycles of the environment and
the "earth system" (i.e. the sum total of physical, chemical, biological
and social processes and interactions on this planet); 4) a
[redistribution of work and wealth that abolishes the subordination of
the reproductive to the productive domain]{.underline} and provides
everyone the possibility of self-realization; this includes a universal
entitlement to [meaningful and satisfying work, a universal right to
leisure]{.underline}, and universally shared responsibility for care
activities; 5) [putting practices of solidarity and cooperative
relationships before logics of competition]{.underline} --- not merely
within existing communities but across ethnic, national, and religious
lines.

As Harvard ecologist and Marxian theorist Richard Levins observed,
"perhaps the first investigation of a complex object as a system was the
masterwork of Karl Marx, Das Kapital," which explored both the economic
and ecological bases of capitalism as a social-metabolic system.2 [The
premise of the dialectics of ecology]{.underline}, as it is addressed in
this article, [is that it is above all in classical historical
materialism/dialectical naturalism that we find the method and analysis
that allows us to connect]{.underline} "[the history of labor and
capitalism]{.underline}" [to that of the]{.underline} "[Earth and the
planet]{.underline}," **[enabling us to investigate from a materialist
standpoint the Anthropocene crisis of our times]{.underline}**.3 In
Marx's words, [humanity is both "a part of nature" and itself "a force
of nature."]{.underline}4 [There was]{.underline}, in his conception,
[no rigid division between natural history and social
history.]{.underline} Rather, "[The history of nature and the history of
men \[humanity\]" were seen as "dependent on each other as long as men
exist."]{.underline}5

[In this view]{.underline}, **[the relation of labor and capitalism to
the earth's metabolism is at the center of the critique of the existing
order.]{.underline}** "Labour," Marx wrote, "is, first of all, a process
between man and nature, a process by which man, through his own actions,
mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and
nature. He confronts the materials of nature as a force of nature."6
However, [with the advent of "capitalist production," a systematic
disturbance and displacement occurs in "the metabolic interaction
between man and the earth,"]{.underline} **[creating a metabolic rift,
or ecological crisis, severing essential natural
relations]{.underline}** [and not only "robbing the worker but...robbing
the soil."]{.underline}7

Today, [this ecological rift]{.underline} in the metabolism of society
and nature [can be seen as having reached an Earth System
level]{.underline}, [creating]{.underline} what scientists have called
[an "**anthropogenic rift**"]{.underline} [in the biogeochemical cycles
of the entire planet]{.underline}, [resulting in]{.underline} what
Frederick Engels referred to metaphorically as [the "revenge" of
nature.]{.underline}8 In the classical historical-materialist
perspective, **[this contradiction can only be resolved by reconciling
humanity and nature]{.underline}**. [Such a reconciliation requires
overcoming not simply the alienation of nature, but the self-alienation
of humanity itself, manifested]{.underline} most fully [in today's
destructive, commodified society. **What is necessary in such an
analysis is recognition from the start of the "corporeal" nature of
human existence itself, which is tied to production.**]{.underline}
Hence, **[if a "new universal history of the human" is necessary in our
time]{.underline}, [it is here]{.underline}, [within the
historical-materialist tradition]{.underline}, [that the necessary
materialist, dialectical, and ecological method is to be
found.]{.underline}** For Marx, "Universally developed individuals,
whose social relations, as their own communal relations, are hence also
subordinated to their own communal control, are no product of nature,
but of history."9 However, [human history is never detached from "the
universal metabolism of nature," of which the social metabolism based in
the labor and production process is an emergent part]{.underline}.10

[In such a dialectical-ecological perspective]{.underline}, **[there are
no fixed answers applicable]{.underline}** to all of history, since
everything around us in natural history and social
history---constituting, as Marx said, the "two sides" of a single
material reality---can be seen as in a state of constant flux.11
Nevertheless, it will be argued here that **[the method of dialectical
ecology, rooted in historical materialism and aimed at transcending the
alienation of humanity and nature, provides a basis for uniting theory
and practice in new, revolutionary ways]{.underline}**. [This
constitutes the necessary dialectical negation or overcoming of the
material conditions of our current alienated, divided, and dangerous
world, itself the product of human historical development]{.underline}.
Such a view assumes that there is a contingent, ever-changing historical
process in which each new emergent reality bears within it an
incompleteness and various contradictory relations, leading to further
transformative developments. As Corrina Lotz indicates, [dialectical
negation properly embraces "absenting]{.underline} (Roy Bhaskar's term),
[removal, loss, conflict, interruption, leaps and breaks,"]{.underline}
[often understood in terms of the general concept of
emergence]{.underline}, or the qualitative shift to higher
organizational levels, [which,]{.underline} as Engels said, [always
carries within it the potential for annihilation]{.underline}.12 [The
structure of history]{.underline}, including natural history, thus
[always contains]{.underline} within it crises and catastrophes, along
with [the possibility of something qualitatively new]{.underline},
[drawn from a combination of residuals of the past]{.underline}
(previously negated realities) [interacting in contingent ways with the
present as history and generating transformative change]{.underline}.
**[History, whether natural or human history, is thus not linear, but
rather manifests itself as a spiral form of development.]{.underline}**

[The notion of human historical development]{.underline}, a relatively
recent conception that scarcely precedes the capitalist era, [is a
product of the changing relation of human beings to nature as a
whole.]{.underline} As Marx recognized, Epicurus in Hellenistic
antiquity saw the origins of natural philosophy or natural science as
tied to an overriding sense of danger that the natural world represented
in the daily lives of human beings.13 In Epicurean philosophy, there was
no rational answer to be found to this existential condition, other than
reconciliation with the world through forms of contemplative
self-consciousness and the development of a sense of oneness with
nature, or ataraxia, by means of enlightenment/science.

[The enormous historical development of the productive
forces]{.underline}, [separating antiquity from the modern
world]{.underline}, [and the emergence of modern science in this context
was to alter fundamentally the relation between humanity and its natural
environment]{.underline}. [Bourgeois society]{.underline}, as a result
of this "progress" and the scientific revolution of the seventeenth
century, [would revel in the "domination of nature"]{.underline}
provided by Enlightenment science. The realm of natural necessity was
seen in this conception as being forever pushed back and even
transcended.14 [This]{.underline}, however, [gave rise]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [the conceit]{.underline}, as Engels noted, [of "human
victories over nature"]{.underline} [in the manner of "a conqueror over
a foreign people,"]{.underline} [a view that]{.underline}, because of
its lack of foresight and its narrow objectives, [led to human-generated
ecological catastrophes]{.underline}.15

As a result of the historical process, **[humanity finds itself once
again confronted with an overarching sense of danger emanating from the
forces of nature]{.underline}**. [Yet, behind this existential threat to
humanity and life lies human labor]{.underline}, [itself a force of
nature]{.underline}, **[now generating planetary-level
catastrophe]{.underline}**. [The alienation of nature under capitalism
is such that money is fetishistically mistaken for existence, while
private extraction and expropriation, the robbery of the earth, is
confused with real wealth.]{.underline} **[In the historical-materialist
view]{.underline}**, **[the contradiction between humanity and the earth
can be transcended before it proves fatal]{.underline}**, [but only if
the two sides of human self-alienation]{.underline}---[alienation from
humanity]{.underline} [and alienation from nature]{.underline}---**[are
transcended through the "revolutionary reconstitution of society as a
whole"]{.underline}** **[and the creation of a world of substantive
equality and ecological sustainability]{.underline}**.16

The development of such an approach based on classical
historical-materialist grounds cannot consist simply of a theoretical
reconstruction of the analysis of Marx and Engels in this area,
involving a synthesis of their contributions to an
ecological-materialist dialectics. At best, the only thing such an
approach can generate is a more critical method in analyzing the
present, although it is the actual overcoming of the present as history
that is the overriding concern. Above all, [it is necessary to address
the rapidly developing ecological crisis of the Anthropocene Epoch in
human history]{.underline}, [which marks the rise of
anthropogenic]{.underline}, as opposed to nonanthropogenic, [factors as
the main driving force of Earth System change.]{.underline} **[Here we
must confront the current financialization of nature, the new phase of
planetary extractivism, questions of human survivability, and the
revolutionary struggle to create a society of planned degrowth and
ecological civilization geared to sustainable human
development]{.underline}**. [All of this]{.underline}, however, [depends
on the **recovery, development, and unification in theory and praxis of
the dialectical-ecological critique of capitalism, which is an
indispensable and indisputable legacy of classical historical
materialism.**]{.underline}

In the Dialectics of Nature, Engels was concerned in particular with
[the failure of classical political economy as "the social science of
the bourgeoisie" to account for "human actions in the fields of
production and exchange" that were unintended, external to the market,
and remote]{.underline}. [The anarchic and unplanned character of the
capitalist economy]{.underline} thus [amplified ecological
disasters]{.underline}. "[What cared the Spanish planters in
Cuba]{.underline}," he wrote,

> [who burned down forests on the slopes of the mountains and obtained
> from the ashes sufficient fertiliser for one generation of very highly
> profitable coffee trees]{.underline}---what cared they [that the heavy
> tropical rainfall afterwards washed away the unprotected upper stratum
> of the soil, leaving behind only bare rock!]{.underline} In relation
> to nature, as to society, [the present mode of production is
> predominantly concerned only about the immediate]{.underline}, the
> [most tangible result; and then surprise is expressed that the more
> remote effects of actions]{.underline} directed to this end [turn out
> to be]{.underline} quite different, are mostly quite [the
> opposite]{.underline} in character.32

In order to [promote the interests of the human community as a
whole]{.underline}, [it was]{.underline} therefore [necessary to carry
out "planned action" and regulate production in line with science,
taking into consideration the]{.underline} earthly
[environment]{.underline}, that is, [in accord with nature's
laws]{.underline}.33

Marx and Engels saw socialism as expanding the forces of production in a
quantitative as well as a qualitative sense, and Engels even referred in
Anti-Dühring to how the advent of socialism would bring about "the
constantly accelerated development of the productive forces and...a
practically unlimited increase of production itself." However, the
context in which they were writing was not [today's "full-world
economy,"]{.underline} but rather a still early stage of
industrialization. In the period of industrial development, extending
from the beginning of the eighteenth century until the first Earth Day
in 1970, world industrial productive potential increased in size around
1,730 times, which from a nineteenth-century perspective, would have
seemed "a practically unlimited increase." Today it, however, it [raises
the issue of ecological "overshoot."]{.underline}34

Hence, the [long-term ecological consequences of production]{.underline}
emphasized by Engels [have more and more come to the fore in our
time]{.underline}. This is symbolized by the proposed Anthropocene Epoch
in the Geologic Time Scale, beginning around 1950, representing the
emergence of human-industrialized society as the primary factor in Earth
System change. From this standpoint, what is perhaps most remarkable
about Engels's statement on the development of the productive forces
under socialism was that it was immediately followed---in the same
paragraph and the one after---by the view that the goal of socialism was
not the expansion of production itself, but rather the "free
development" of human beings, which required a rational and planned
relation to "the whole sphere of the conditions of life which environ
man."35

Marx and Engels, therefore, viewed planning as crucial in the
organization of socialist/communist society, freeing it from the
domination of commodity exchange, and relying on a "common plan."
Nevertheless, they cannot be seen as envisioning the kind of central
planning under a command economy, as this was to emerge in the late
1920s and '30s in the Soviet Union. Rather, they contended that planning
by the direct producers would be democratic with respect to production
itself.36 The entire system of socialism, as Marx put it, "starts with
the self-government of the communities" in a society where "cooperative
labor" would be "developed to national dimensions and,
consequently...fostered by national means."37 The [rational organization
of human labor as communal or cooperative labor]{.underline}, moreover,
[could not occur without a planning system]{.underline}. "All directly
social or communal labour on a larger scale requires, to a greater or
lesser degree, a directing authority, in order to secure the harmonious
co-operation of the activities of individuals, and to perform the
general functions that have their origin in the total productive
organism," as a system of social metabolic reproduction.
[Production]{.underline} therefore [requires guidance, foresight, and
management]{.underline}, in the sense of a "conductor" of an orchestra.
Marx's vision of a planned economy, as Michael A. Lebowitz emphasized,
was one run by "associated conductors" who would rationally govern the
metabolism between humanity and nature.38

As Marx wrote in Theories of Surplus Value, on the need for a
noncapitalist, and thus a non-exhaustive, approach to labor and nature,

> [Anticipation of the future]{.underline}---real anticipation---[occurs
> in the production of wealth only in relation to the worker and to the

[Capitalism]{.underline}, according to the founders of historical
materialism, [promoted]{.underline} a negative, perverse dialectic of
[exploitation, expropriation, and exhaustion/extermination, the "common

### Market Accelleration 

#### [Market Accelerationism DA]{.underline}\-\--focus on green tech locks in societal collapse -- alt alone solves

[Marx's theory of metabolic rift]{.underline}, or his theory of
ecological crisis, [was fully recovered only in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}.96 [It derives its importance from its materialist
dialectical conception of the alienated metabolism of nature and society
under capitalism,]{.underline} [a system that is now exploiting the
world's population as never before while expropriating the earth on
which humanity depends. This is the one critical perspective that fully
encompasses both the social and extrahuman dimensions of the
environmental crisis]{.underline}, [seeing the class and ecological
contradictions of capitalism as two sides of a **single
dynamic**]{.underline}. The social metabolism represented by production
mediates the material relation of humanity to ecological systems all the
way from local ecosystems up to the Earth System.

[This accords with Earth System science itself]{.underline}, which
focuses on the disruption of the Earth System metabolism resulting in
the anthropogenic rift in the biogeochemical cycles of the planet,
[creating the present habitability crisis]{.underline}. The result of
this recovery of Marx's metabolic rift theory has been a formidable
array of explorations of the social dimensions of the Earth System
crisis, stretching from the metabolism of the soil to the climate to
Earth System analysis.97 [Nevertheless, Marx's conception of the
metabolic rift is only truly useful insofar as it provides us with a
more active understanding of the social metabolism of human beings and
the earth in all of its complexity as part of an overall materialist
dialectics. For this, **what is necessary is both a dialectics of
society and a dialectics of nature, forming the basis of a new global
environmental praxis.**]{.underline}

Today, [the world is faced with two opposing tendencies]{.underline}.
[One is the attempted acceleration of capital through the
financialization of nature based on market forces and associated with
processes of so-called decarbonization and
dematerialization]{.underline}. [The goal]{.underline} here [is to
subsume the world within the abstract logic of money as a substitute for
real-world existence---an alienated logic that can only lead to total
disaster, the barren negation of humanity itself]{.underline}. **[The
other is the emerging struggle for planned degrowth and sustainable
human development aimed at shifting power from global capital to workers
on the ground and in their communities throughout the planet,
representing the potential new power of an emerging environmental
proletariat]{.underline}**. **[This necessitates the merging of the
economic and environmental struggles of the exploited and expropriated
populations throughout the world in a new, broader form of
cooperation]{.underline}**. People at the grassroots are being driven to
defend not just their work, but also their environments and their
communities, and indeed, the habitability of the planet itself,
conceived as a home for humanity and all other species. [For this,
however, we need a new, revolutionary dialectics of
ecology.]{.underline}

### Incompatibility DA 

#### Fixing the environment incompatible with cap -- only radical change will solve

Accessed 7-7-2025, HDSCW - JX\]

As well, **[many concrete climate solutions follow from an
anti-capitalist approach to climate change]{.underline}** --- all
surprisingly hope-inducing at a time when meaningful action is stalling.
Which raises the question: Are we missing out on important ideas because
we assume these schools of thought are fringe, boring or, worse,
irrelevant? You don't need to have any particular politics to recognize
that **[the climate crisis is overwhelmingly attributable to economic
activity]{.underline}**. A study in 2019 by the Colorado-based Climate
Accountability Institute, for example, found that from the birth of
industry in 1751 to 2017, the production and burning of products from
just 103 fossil fuel companies was responsible for nearly 70 percent of
all the greenhouse gas emissions. From 1965 onward, once the whole
planet had an endless hunger for energy, the activities and products of
just 20 of those companies contributed a third of all emissions. They
include Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP and the state-owned companies of Saudi
Arabia, Russia, Iran and India, among others. Once oil and coal are
extracted, it is the rich who burn it the most. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, [the team at the United Nations responsible for
assessing scientific research on the matter, said in 2022 that
households "with the highest per capita emissions contribute a
disproportionately large share of \[global household\]
emissions."]{.underline} How disproportionate? On a planet of eight
billion people, the richest one percent contribute the same share of
yearly emissions as the poorest two-thirds, according to the Stockholm
Environment Institute. [To help visualize those numbers, imagine the
population of Germany emitting about as much carbon dioxide as the
populations of North America, Europe and Asia combined. Billions of
people use electricity, drive cars, cook with gas and buy tonnes of
plastic products every year and still emit less than the number of
people who watched the Super Bowl in 2023.]{.underline} No matter what
scale you look at, climate change is deeply tied to economic activity.
Industry feeds it; consumers sustain it. **[The people most affected by
the climate crisis are always the most dispossessed, whether we look at
flooding island nations in the Pacific or Indigenous Peoples in the
Amazon defending their land from logging companies.]{.underline}** A
lack of wealth or rights makes you vulnerable to the whims of the
powerful. If you accept that premise, then you can't say [the
problem]{.underline} is a few greedy companies operating in a few
countries. It [has to be systemic]{.underline}, and the [only accurate
label for that system is "capitalism."]{.underline} If you find that
difficult to accept, you're not alone. Right-wing politicians have
increasingly begun referring to progressive policies they dislike as
"authoritarian," a word that recalls the Red Scare of the Cold War. This
rhetoric is more prominent in the United States than in Canada, with 60
per- cent of Americans viewing socialism negatively, according to a 2022
Pew Research survey. "**[We're so used to capitalism that we don't
necessarily even know it when we see it,]{.underline}**" says Emily
Huddart Kennedy, a sociologist at the University of British Columbia who
researches sustainable food movements. She says **[many people find
socialism and communism so unpalatable that the distaste can
"short-circuit people's ability to think thoughtfully and reflectively."
The reaction is so strong that she's noticed some anti-capitalist
campaigners have to avoid talking about their principles in order to
mobilize more people. "One participant said, 'If I start spewing off
about capitalism and power and oppression, nobody's going to listen to
me.'"]{.underline}** This phenomenon isn't entirely caused by simple
bias. People also genuinely struggle to come up with concrete forms of
climate action that don't require a capitalist economy, Kennedy says.
For example, trying to create an alternative food system is difficult
without the capitalist constructs of land tenure rights and industry
partners who have financing and supply chains. Devising feasible
solutions and being an anti-capitalist seem to be mutually exclusive.
Even academic economists, who like to say that they are ideologically
neutral, have trouble assessing anti-capitalist ideas without bias.
Between 2017 and 2018, economists Mohsen Javdani of Simon Fraser
University in Vancouver and HaJoon Chang of the School of Oriental and
African Studies in London surveyed 2,425 economists around the world for
ideological bias. Participants were presented with opinions from notable
economist thinkers with the attributions jumbled up. Then they were
asked whether they agreed with the opinions. In most cases, participants
were more likely to agree with a statement when told it came from a
mainstream thinker, like Adam Smith, than a less mainstream one, like
Karl Marx. Neither of the researchers is an outright Marxist, by the
way. Chang believes in reforming the free market, not abolishing it. In
his breezy book 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism,
published in 2010, he points to the rapid economic growth of East Asian
countries like Taiwan and South Korea as an example of how capitalism
can be a force for good. In fact, it's a philosopher-economist, Kohei
Saito, of the University of Tokyo, who has attempted, as he puts it, to
"resolve the tension between Red and Green." His 2020 book, Capital in
the Anthropocene, became a surprise hit in Japan. In early 2023, he
released a sequel of sorts, Marx in the Anthropocene, that drew on
notebooks Karl Marx kept in the last 15 years of his life. This was
Saito's first popular book in English, and reviews soon flooded in from
the New York Times, the Guardian and other esteemed publications that
seemed to be taking Saito seriously. [At the heart of his analysis is
Marx's conclusion not just that wealth is produced by the many and
hoarded by the few, but that nature itself is a casualty of
capitalism]{.underline}. For example, in 1869, Marx documented his
concern about the consequences of industrialized livestock rearing,
driven by a growing appetite for meat. "It will not be long before the
Irish farmer experiences that this system will end in the total
exhaustion of the land," he wrote. In other words, [Saito argues that
capitalism and a healthy planet are intrinsically at odds.]{.underline}
He even says that our individual lives are stunted because we've lost
the joy that comes from engaging with nature. We seek fulfilment in
"destructive, extravagant and wasteful products." The defenders of
capitalism say there are no realistic alternatives. Capitalism has been
the status quo since the steam engine. It has propelled billions out of
poverty and enabled huge leaps in medicine and technology. Capitalism
has given us longer, healthier, happier lives, with material comforts
past generations couldn't dream of. It's unclear whether a more
centralized government would do any better, or whether the vestiges of
capitalism would reassert income inequality in the long run. If we
completely overhaul the system, could we live without the benefits it's
given us? Also unknown: under an anti-capitalist system, what happens to
the rights we expect, like owning our homes, protecting our work with
copyright and supporting our children with an inheritance? Critics of
capitalism are adamant that we have to open the discussion. And, being
famously unconsolidated, the left has proposed multiple alternatives to
the current system. Even within the climate movement there is a spectrum
of thought, factions splitting at each new probe like Hydra heads.

# AT to impact turns

### AT impact turn -- cap good growth 

#### Boom bust cycles and deregulation creates structures for more economic inequality

There have been [long-standing warnings that the post-Thatcher and
Reagan era of free market, privatised, deregulated, and financialised
capitalism was a mistake,]{.underline} not only because of the
injustices, hardship and inequality it created, metred out and
exacerbated[, but also because it failed even on its own
terms]{.underline}, which was supposedly to turn around the economic
performance of the 1970s, which had been weaker than the preceding 1950s
and 1960s. Those preceding decades have sometimes been dubbed the
'Golden Age of Capitalism', as not only was there sustained economic
growth and full employment, but governments of all political persuasions
generally regarded it as their duty to maintain full employment, and to
ensure the economic growth thought required to sustain that.

While experience varied between countries, generally this involved the
'commanding heights' of the economy being in public ownership -- the
national utilities of water, gas and electricity, along with the crucial
productive infrastructure of transport and telecommunications, with the
remainder of the economy being regulated to various degrees. Government
spending was used to maintain full employment, along with the
implementation of industrial policies, regional policies, and active
labour market policies. These interventionist measures generally went
beyond just maintaining economic growth and full employment, to welfare
state delivery, such as a commitment to public housebuilding, for the
provision of flats and houses to rent.

On a global scale this was underpinned by the post-war 'Bretton Woods'
settlement that imposed strict capital controls to prevent international
speculative financial flows, the use of fixed exchange rates underpinned
by the gold standard, and international institutions including the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help deliver this
global commitment to prevent any 'return to the 1930s'. [And sure
enough, global recession -- where the world's output and income actually
declines, rather than slows as was the case during the business cycle
troughs of the 1950s and 1960s -- was avoided until the post-Thatcher
and Reagan era of 'capitalism unleashed' created the international
financial crisis of 2007--2008 and consequent global recession of
2009]{.underline}. [This in turn led to further economic crises and
disruption, including the European sovereign debt crisis, most acute in
Greece but also impacting other countries -- plus the self-imposed
austerity policies adopted by the UK and other governments.]{.underline}

The warnings that a change of course was needed grew louder following
the 2007--2009 crisis and recession, with [calls for a 'sustainable
capitalism', 'inclusive growth' and other such formulations]{.underline}
-- coming even from the likes of the World Economic Forum at Davos,
calling for a 'great reset'.

[Added to this was the widespread appreciation that action to prevent
the climate crisis had proved inadequate, and that more actively
interventionist measures would be required]{.underline}. This included
questioning the previous assumption that the benefits from productivity
growth should be realized through working just as hard and long, with
ever-increased output, rather than through reduced working time.

[There was a recognition that the increased inequality of income,
wealth, geography and power were dysfunctional -- economically and
socially]{.underline}. During the 'golden age' of what might be termed
regulated capitalism -- including, indeed perhaps most importantly, on a
global scale -- preventing such inequalities was regarded as one of the
core purposes of government, along with maintaining full employment
through fostering economic growth. [Abandoning that regulatory
structure, to unleash capitalism, increased inequalities. This created
fertile conditions for the 2007--2009 global financial crisis, with the
super wealthy demanding ever higher returns on their funds, which the
deregulated financial sector delivered through ever more exotic
financial products, often made up from the loans that the rest of the
population had been taking out to make ends meet, and which were
supposed to be valuable because the loans would be repaid, but when the
loan repayments couldn't be met and were defaulted upon, these
'products' were exposed as worthless, collapsing the whole house of
cards.]{.underline}

[The divisions in wealth and geography also provided an open goal for
demagogues and populists, making the political system unstable in many
countries.]{.underline}

[All this led to a recognition that the free market and its 'greed is
good culture' would not necessarily solve the world's
problems]{.underline}. Nor even return economic growth to that seen in
the 1950s and 1960s.

[The monetarist and free market medicine of the 1980s had made the
patient sicker rather than healthier.]{.underline} Average growth rates
of output and productivity -- which had been the diagnosis of why
'something had to be done' about the economic problems in the 1970s --
were lower in the subsequent decades up to the 2007--2008 international
financial crisis than they had been during the regulated era of the
1950s and 1960s. [This poorer overall economic performance would have
made everyone worse off, had nothing been done about distribution.
Something was done about distribution -- not to protect the worse off,
but to skew the distribution of income and wealth still further towards
the already richest, making things ever worse.]{.underline}

It is important to clarify immediately that [extreme poverty is defined
in terms of subsistence goods. It refers to the inability to access
basic food, shelter, clothing, and fuel; it does *not* refer to higher
welfare standards such as access to electricity, modern health care,
refrigerators, and so on, which are available today]{.underline}. [It is
not difficult to meet basic subsistence requirements, and historical
data suggests that human communities are normally capable of doing so,
even in pre-industrial contexts,]{.underline} with their own labor and
with the resources available to them in their environment or through
exchange. The main exceptions to this are in cases of natural disaster,
or under conditions in which people are cut off from land and commons,
or when their labor, resources, and productive capacities are
appropriated by a ruling class or an imperial power. The historical data
we review shows that it was [the process of colonization and capitalist
integration]{.underline} that [mainly pushed people into extreme poverty
and caused social indicators to deteriorate.]{.underline}

The crucial implication of this finding is that **[extreme poverty
should not be used as a benchmark against which to measure
progress]{.underline}. [Extreme poverty should not exist, period. The
fact that up to 17 percent of the world population lives in extreme
poverty today]{.underline}** (according to Robert Allen's data on
cost-of-basic-needs poverty) **[should be understood as an indictment of
our economic
system.]{.underline}**[^8^](https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/capitalism-global-poverty-and-the-case-for-democratic-socialism/#en8)
[**It is a sign that severe social dislocation remains institutionalized
in the capitalist world economy.**]{.underline} Yes, [**the prevalence
of extreme poverty is lower today than it was at the height of the
colonial period, but this is not sufficient reason for celebration.**
The colonial high-water mark was an *effect* of capitalist policy and
should never have existed.]{.underline}

Furthermore, **[extreme poverty can and should be ended immediately. It
does not require further increases in aggregate production, it does not
require a massive mobilization of charity; rather, it requires no more
than restoring people's access to the basic resources they need for
survival.]{.underline}** The existing world economy, despite its
extraordinary output, appears incapable of achieving this basic
objective: **[projections indicate that with existing trends it will
take at least forty years to end extreme poverty]{.underline},** even
according to the World Bank's inadequate metric (three decades later
than promised by the sustainable development goals), and possibly as
long as a
century.[^9^](https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/capitalism-global-poverty-and-the-case-for-democratic-socialism/#en9)
**[This should be condemned as a failure. Instead, we are enjoined to
accept as "normal" a form of suffering that need not exist and can be
ended immediately.]{.underline}** What is required? We must ensure
peasants have access to productive land, workers have secure employment
and living wages, and universal access to affordable housing and food.
**[This is not complicated, it is *basic*.]{.underline}**

([mostly bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or

[A]{.underline} second [major assumption in green growth scenarios
is]{.underline} that [efficiency improvements]{.underline} can be
achieved to an extent that [radically decouples GDP from energy
use]{.underline}. The main problem here is that the [assumed rates of
decoupling are not supported in the empirical
literature]{.underline}---[they are well outside even the most heroic
documented achievements]{.underline}. Furthermore, [empirical studies
reveal that in a growth-oriented economy, gains from efficiency
improvements tend to be leveraged to expand processes of production and
consumption, which]{.underline} tends to [erode absolute reductions in
energy or material use.]{.underline}5 In short, [efficiency improvements
are important, but in an economy organized around growth]{.underline}
and accumulation [they do not deliver the results we need]{.underline}.
The problem therefore is not primarily our technology, but rather the
objectives of the economy.

### AT cap stops war 

#### Capitalist crises locks in wars of accumulation\-\--interdependence doesn't check

Santa Barbara, **2023**

But if by imperialism we mean the incessant pressures for the outward
expansion of capitalism, the conquest of new spaces by global capital,
and the various political, military, and cultural processes that
facilitate this expansion and appropriation by the TCC of wealth that it
generates, then this is a structural imperative built into capitalism.
It is a process that predates the situation described by Lenin and that
has continued after his thesis has become outdated. During the 500 plus
years that have transpired since the genesis of the capitalist
world-system, colonialism and imperialism have coercively incorporated
zones and peoples into its fold. [The process of original accumulation
is coming to a close]{.underline}, especially after the incorporation in
recent decades of China and the former Soviet Union. [The system
continues to violently conquer space, nature, and people; but it has
transmuted]{.underline}. This is not imperialism in the old sense
either, of rival national capitals or conquest by core states of
pre-capitalist regions.

[The challenge]{.underline} we face, therefore, [is how to
explain]{.underline} the [current escalation of geopolitical tensions
and interstate conflict]{.underline} so epitomized with the Ukraine
conflict and Washington's New Cold War, [despite]{.underline} the
[transnational integration of]{.underline} the [leading sectors of
national capitalist classes]{.underline}. The [TCC did not face barriers
to investment in Russia prior to]{.underline} the [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}, notwithstanding mounting political tensions
between Moscow and Washington; while the principal capitalist
conglomerates based in the United States and China have experienced an
ongoing process of cross-penetration and integration in recent decades
that far from reversing has actually deepened even in the midst of the
New Cold War (Rhodium Group 2022).2 [Neither U.S.-Russia nor U.S.-China
inter-state relations can be collapsed into transnational capital
relations]{.underline}.

[Relentless capitalist expansion is a process that generates constant
crises and bewildering contradictions]{.underline}. [Geopolitical
conflict escalates as states]{.underline}, [in their effort to retain
legitimacy]{.underline} [and]{.underline} to [keep the internal social
order]{.underline} from fracturing, [seek to sublimate and to
externalize social and political tensions in the face of capitalist
crisis]{.underline}, [the loss of legitimacy, chronic instability, and
social disintegration.]{.underline} [Imperial states seek to displace
internal contradictions to the Global South or to imperial
rivals.]{.underline} (By imperial states I mean those that have the
power to externalize these contradictions, and I do not mean
"imperialist capital."). While [the TCC pursues endless
accumulation]{.underline}, [national states in this age of globalization
run up against the contradiction between their accumulation function and
their legitimacy function]{.underline}. That is, [the national state
faces a contradiction between the need to promote transnational capital
accumulation in its territory in competition with other states and its
need to achieve internal political legitimacy and stabilize the domestic
social order]{.underline}. [This contradiction generates a politics of
crisis management]{.underline} that bewilders observers who confuse
surface appearance with underlying essence.

This confusion was most apparent with Trump's alleged protectionist
policies and trade war with China, interpreted by many as a reversal of
globalization and as rivalry between "U.S." capital and capital from
other countries. In this regard, observers confuse "U.S." capital with
transnational capital located inside U.S. borders. Nearly three decades
into the debate on the TCC, opponents of the concept still fall back
hopelessly into a nation-state framework of analysis that blinds them to
what we mean by transnational capital. These opponents assume that by
saying "transnational capital located inside U.S. borders" I mean
"foreign" capital invested inside the United States. I mean nothing of
the sort. Rather, capitalists from the United States are integrated into
transnational clusters with capitalists from numerous other countries.
These transnational clusters invest inside the United States and inside
other countries, so that "transnational capital located inside U.S.
borders" includes U.S. capitalists located inside U.S. borders.

In fact, when Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel in 2018, he was
opposed by much of the TCC and the political elite in the United States,
including much of the Republican Party and sectors of the steel industry
that relied on cheaper imported steel for the production of intermediate
and finished steel products. Even the far-right billionaire Koch
brothers launched a multimillion dollar campaign against tariffs
(Schwartz 2018). In fact, the single biggest beneficiary of steel
tariffs was ArcelorMittal, the Indian-based company that owns majority
shares in U.S. Steel (Stein 2018), which Trump had called a symbol of
"American" economic prowess.3

The [impulse towards nationalism, populism, and protectionism reflect
contradictory attempts to refound state legitimacy under]{.underline}
the [destabilizing conditions of capitalist globalization]{.underline},
[yet this impulse is not-supported by the TCC]{.underline}.4 Clearly,
[the state and the TCC can have conflicting objectives.]{.underline}
Unlike global capitalists, [statemanagers and political elites reproduce
their status within the nation-state and in relation to the
international system. Capital and the state]{.underline}---and more
generally the political and the economic---[may form a larger unity but
they cannot be collapsed into one]{.underline}. Those who explain the
current escalation of geopolitical conflict as national economic rivalry
simplify this relationship and end up committing the error of economism.
The capitalist state is not a mere instrument of capital and its
policies may contradict those of specific capitalist groups, or under
certain historical circumstances, of capital as a whole.

The relationship between economics and politics---between capital and
political operatives in the state---is mediated in complex ways that
make them tension-ridden. [In its attempt to secure legitimacy and
assure]{.underline} the [reproduction of the social order as a whole,
the capitalist state can and often does impose restraint on capital or
pursue policies that contravene capitalist interests]{.underline}, [such
as Trump's steel tariffs]{.underline} or the Chinese state's crackdown
on tech billionaires. The extent of control that capitalists are able to
exercise over the state varies in accordance with tenure of class
struggles and capitalist crisis. In the late twentieth and early
twenty-first centuries, the emergent TCC managed to exercise a more
direct, instrumental control over the state in pursuit of its
globalization agenda. But this level of [instrumental control achieved
in the heyday of globalization now appears to give way to greater state
autonomy.]{.underline} [Politics]{.underline}, including geopolitics,
may be coming to *overdetermine* economics.

The political and economic architecture of the post-World War II
international order was already crumbling prior to the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. [The United States is no longer the market of last resort
and nor can it continue indefinitely to serve as the liquidity provider
of last resort.]{.underline} The political control afforded to the U.S.
state by a dollar-denominated global economy is at odds with increasing
political multipolarity. The [unprecedented sanctions slapped on Russia
and heightened international political polarization in the wake of the
invasion]{.underline} has [hastened the introduction of alternatives to
the dollar-based]{.underline} SWIFT [system of international
payments]{.underline}, such as China's CIPS (Cross-Border Payments
System) and Russia's SPSF (System for Transfer of Financial Messages).
Nonetheless, [no national or regional economy can survive outside of its
integration into the larger global economy]{.underline}. Consider as an
indicator of this interdependence that trade in intermediate goods, such

percent of all trade among the rich countries of the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development that dominate the global trade

Some scholars have framed the crisis of global capitalism in terms of a
declining U.S. hegemony and the rise of a Chinese competitor. [But no
new nation-state power can supply the political authority necessary to
stabilize the now-inextricably integrated global economy]{.underline}.
The [crisis of hegemony in the international system takes place within
this single, integrated global economy.]{.underline} [No one
state]{.underline}, no matter how powerful, [can control the process of
global accumulation]{.underline}. [This disjuncture between a globalized
economy and a nation-state-based system of political authority generates
enormous geopolitical tensions]{.underline}. The [end of Western
domination of world capitalism is upon us as the center of gravity of
the global economy shifts to China. But China will not become a new
hegemon.]{.underline} Rather, [we are moving towards political
multipolarity]{.underline} [at a time of acute crisis in global
capitalism]{.underline}---[prolonged economic turbulence and political
decay]{.underline}.

The [breakdown of the political organization of world capitalism is not
the cause but]{.underline} the [consequence of contradictions internal
to]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [globally]{.underline} integrated
[system of capital accumulation. Escalating geopolitical conflict is
pushing us towards global conflagration]{.underline}. [Wars provide
enormous outlet for surplus accumulated capital]{.underline}.

[The idea that racism can be connected to capitalism has been around for
a long time]{.underline}; [the question is how the connection works, and
whether the two are inextricable.]{.underline} [Martin Luther King,
Jr.]{.underline}, in his great speech on the steps of the Alabama
statehouse at the conclusion of the Selma-to-Montgomery march, in 1965,
[said]{.underline}, "[The segregation of the races was]{.underline}
really [a political stratagem employed by the emerging]{.underline}
Bourbon [interests in the South]{.underline} [to keep the southern
masses divided and southern labor the cheapest in the
land.]{.underline}" King was at that moment pushing for the passage of
the Voting Rights Act and other civil-rights legislation, so he had a
reason to locate the nexus of race and capitalism specifically in the
Southern Jim Crow system. Within a year, he was leading demonstrations
against slumlords in hyper-segregated Chicago, and advocating new forms
of national legislation, like the Fair Housing Act. In 2018, more than
ninety per cent of African-American voters in Missouri cast their
ballots against Josh Hawley, the victorious Republican candidate for the
U.S. Senate; Hawley now presents himself as a critic of global
capitalism without ever mentioning race. [It's possible to be
anti-capitalist without being anti-racist, and anti-racist without being
anti-capitalist.]{.underline} Johnson might say that both positions are
deluded, but they have [appeared regularly in our country's
history.]{.underline}

[Through it all, black neighborhoods, especially poor black
neighborhoods, still bear the weight of a malign history.]{.underline}
Reading "The Broken Heart of America" inevitably prompts the question of
how what's broken might be repaired. Does a politically charged history
come with a politics for the here and now?

Historically, Johnson doesn't find many people to admire. Among whites,
the main exceptions are a few Communists and radically inclined labor
organizers. He takes a dim view, too, of mainstream black organizations
like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Urban League. Liberal politicians hardly
attract his notice, except when, as in the case of Lincoln, their
reputations require revising downward. But after laying out a
relentlessly bleak history he ends, jarringly, on a hopeful note. During
the unrest following Michael Brown's death, he tells us, "the
disinherited of St. Louis rose again to take control of their history."
Since then, a number of activists---Johnson provides thumbnail sketches
of them---have launched efforts in poor black neighborhoods meant to
reverse, or at least resist, the pernicious workings of racial
capitalism. Today, Johnson writes, "I have never been to a more amazing,
hopeful place in my life." Underlying his stated optimism is an implicit
conviction that it wouldn't do much good to look for help from the
larger society; the victims of oppression must find a way forward by
themselves[.]{.underline}

As a child in the Jim Crow South during the civil-rights era, growing up
in a conservative white milieu, I often overheard bitter adult
conversations about the hypocrisy of white liberals in the North. Were
they really any better than Southern segregationists, to go by their
lived behavior? Walter Johnson[,]{.underline} coming from the left,
offers a good deal of empirical support for opinions like that. His
account discourages us from drawing much hope from past events like the
passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, the major civil-rights victories of
the sixties, or the election of Barack Obama as President; [the regime
of racial capitalism, in his vision, always manages to reconstitute
itself. Broader reforms that aimed, at least, to smooth the roughest
edges of capitalism---like the regulation of business excesses or the
creation of Social Security and Medicaid---are, we gather, no match for
white supremacy.]{.underline}

[Democratic politics,]{.underline} especially in a country with a racial
history like ours, i[s necessarily messy,]{.underline} impure, and
[capable of producing no more than partial victories, a]{.underline}nd,
[even then, only when pushed hard by political movements. But deflating
and deriding the progress it has made in the past and the promise it
might hold for the future invites]{.underline} the hazards of
[defeatism]{.underline}. [It distracts from the]{.underline} kinds of
economic, educational, and criminal-justice [reforms that]{.underline}
mainstream [progressives hope to enact.]{.underline} [These are the
tools we have at hand. It would be a shame not to use them.]{.underline}

**Terzi**, Economist at the European Commission's Directorate-General

\[Alessio, "Introduction: The Origins of Discontent" *Growth for Good:
Reshaping Capitalism to Save Humanity from Climate Catastrophe*, Harvard
University Press, 2022, introduction HDCSW-JCP\]

It is beyond the scope of this book to analyze closely the pros and cons
of these vari ous measures--- over which much ink has been spilled
already, and much more will be in coming years. [Zooming out and taking
the long view]{.underline}, however, [we are only seeing in this reform
dialectic the standard, pos itive, corrective forces that have always
operated at the intersection of de mocracy and capitalism and always
sustained their combined success]{.underline}.24 In a compelling recent
book, po liti cal scientist Francesco Boldizzoni traces the history of
two centuries of mistaken predictions of the end of capitalism.25 Again
and again, [detractors failed to understand capitalism's incredible
adaptability, and the system's ability to change proved key to its
durability]{.underline}. Perhaps the most notorious historical
example--- the one that disproved Karl Marx's forecast of doom--- was
German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's innovation in 1889. His
establishment of the first old- age security system based on a payroll-
financed public pension was an extremely effective po liti cal tactic to
stifle growing support for socialism. That policy, which then spread to
the rest of Eu rope, is widely seen as the origin of [welfare capi
talism, and credited with extending the benefits of material progress
more tangibly to the working class]{.underline}. [We have witnessed the
same dynamic repeat edly: when the economic system runs out of control,
public pressure grows, democracy channels that discontent into political
processes, and eventually there is correction]{.underline}. [To state
this so simply is not to downplay the painful operational hurdles of a
pro cess that has always been and will always be messy]{.underline}. It
is far from easy to assem ble the required citizen pressure, po liti cal
leadership, election results, consensus- building capacities, pushback
against entrenched vested interests, and so on. [Yet, ultimately, change
is brought about]{.underline}. In short, [as "radical" proposals
continue to arise]{.underline}, and in all likeli hood
[some]{.underline} of those listed above [are implemented]{.underline}
in coming years, [we should not be surprised when they not only make the
system more equi table but prove to be compatible with
capitalism.]{.underline}

Can the same be predicted on the subject of this book's prime concern---
the tensions among disenchantments with current capitalism, pushes
toward environmental sustainability, and calls to abandon economic
growth? Climate change will be in all likelihood the defining challenge
for hu manity for de cades to come, and no one seriously discussing the
future prospects of capitalism can shy away from its interaction with
nature. But while anyone drawing up a radical reform agenda might
consider it a natu ral fit, [abandoning economic growth does not belong
on the wish list of reforms]{.underline}. You may sympathize with
minimalism, abhor material ac cumulation and clutter, or embrace the
anti- flying social movement known as Flygskam. [You may loathe the
omnipresent cars choking the streets, despise the vast islands of
plastic floating in the oceans, or love small local shops versus large
chain department stores. None of this is cause for suppressing economic
growth. Your vision of a better world might clash with the real ity of
today but it is perfectly compatible with capitalism.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, for reasons explained in Chapter 2, [halting growth would
mean felling one of the fundamental pillars of our economic
system]{.underline}; rather than a reform of capitalism, [it would bring
about its demise]{.underline}. This alone sig nals a need for caution.
Too many academics, natu ral scientists, and mem bers of the general
public genuinely concerned about climate change and the environment are
flirting with post- growth ideas, I suspect, without fully realizing
their wide- reaching economic and po liti cal implications. To them is
devoted the first part of this book.

To be sure, for some, the idea of tearing down the whole economic system
we live in might seem perfectly reasonable. As an Economist article put
it recently, "many voters will feel that the social contract has been so
badly breached that they would rather rip it up altogether."26
Environmental ac tivists might view capitalism as so inevitably
intertwined with resource ex traction and climate change that only its
demise could preserve the planet. To them is devoted the second part of
this book, in which tearing down the current economic system is shown to
be neither inevitable nor desirable.

[What a post- capitalistic world might look like is anybody's
guess]{.underline}. While some believe that it would usher in a utopian
society in which people live in peaceful harmony with each other and
with nature, [there are significant reasons to predict a much grimmer
outcome--- and to doubt that people will spontaneously embrace a "less
is more" philosophy en masse. If this real ity were to be ignored and a
model of simple living imposed top down, it is likely that the organ
ization of society would rapidly produce misery]{.underline}. [Sold as a
dream of liberation from the iron cage of capitalism and consumerism,
the utopian society would paradoxically turn dystopian. In spite of the
initial aspiration of its ideologues, it would be exposed to the risk of
becoming illiberal, inward- looking, and conflictual, and would stoke
worse tensions within and among countries.]{.underline}

Under any circumstances, post- growth or not, [the only credible way of
avoiding a climate catastrophe is to accelerate the development and wide
spread adoption of "green" innovations]{.underline}. To accept this fact
is to understand that abandoning capitalism would take us further away
from our climate goals, by throwing sand in the gears of an innovation
machinery that is un matched in human history. [Innovation and economic
growth are, in fact, inextricable]{.underline}. This is no call for
despair. [With the right policy actions, capitalism can be enlisted as
an essential force in the fight against climate change, and humanity
need not devolve into violent scrambles over scarce
resources]{.underline}.

[It is possible to envision a credible decarbonization strategy---
meaning one that creates strong incentives, at the individual, group,
and national levels---to meet ambitious climate targets]{.underline}.
That strategy will need to re spect six basic princi ples, as summed up
in Chapter 8: growth is imperative; the price mechanism shapes supply
and demand; government action acceler ates change; social cohesion must
be maintained; early adopters pave the way; and international
cooperation can achieve loose coordination.

Decarbonizing the global economy at the necessary speed will take an
effort by literally all actors in society: not only governments and
green- innovation firms, but all businesses, every part of the financial
sector, and, crucially, every individual. No one should be under the
impression that this is going to be easy, but we cannot be deterred by
the difficulty. To borrow from President John F. Kennedy's galvanizing
announcement, seventy years ago, that the United States would send
astronauts to the moon, our resolve today to save the planet should
"serve to or ga nize and mea sure the best of our energies and skills,
because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win."2

[There are many contradictions in the capitalist system, and some are
more salient than others]{.underline}. The incredible class and social
inequalities and collapsing environmental conditions are obvious
priorities. [But then comes the "**too big to fail, too monstrous to
survive**" contradiction. Neither the social inequality nor
environmental degradation issues can be addressed without taking on this
underlying contradiction. A socialist and anti-capitalist program will
have to negotiate a knife-edge path between preserving that which
services the world's population and]{.underline} which [appears
too]{.underline} big and [foundational to fail while
confronting]{.underline} [the fact that it is becoming too monstrous to
survive without sparking geopolitical conflicts that]{.underline} will
likely [turn the innumerable small wars and internal
struggles]{.underline} already raging across the planet [into a global
conflagration]{.underline}.

This is the core of the problem. [In Marx's time, if there was a sudden
collapse of capitalism, most people]{.underline} in the world [would
still have been able to feed themselves and reproduce]{.underline}. They
were reasonably self-sufficient in their local area procuring the kinds
of things they needed to live and reproduce. People could put some sort
of breakfast on their table irrespective of what was going on in the
global economy and in global markets. Right [now, that's no longer the
case in many parts of the world. Most people]{.underline} in the United
States, in much of Europe, in Japan, and now increasingly in China,
India, Indonesia, and in Latin America [are depending more and more on
the delivery of food through the circulation of capital. I]{.underline}n
Marx's time, perhaps 10 percent of the global population was vulnerable
to disruptions in the circulation of capital, as opposed to many more
who were subject to famines, droughts, epidemics, and other
environmental disruptions. The crisis of European capitalism in 1848 was
part a product of harvest failures and part produced by a speculative
crash focused on railroad finance. Since then, [capital operating in the
world market has largely eliminated the prospect of starvation due to
supposedly natural causes. If there is famine the underlying
causes]{.underline} (as opposed to the immediate triggers) [can
invariably be traced to failures in the social and political system of
capitalist governance and distribution.]{.underline} [**Much of the
world's population is now dependent upon the circulation of capital** to
procure and ensure its food supply, access the fuels and the energy
required to support daily life, and to maintain the elaborate structures
and equipment of communication that facilitate the coordination of basic
production requirements.]{.underline}

**[Capital]{.underline}**, right now, **[may be too deeply implicated in
the reproduction of daily life to fail]{.underline}**. [The economic
consequences and social impacts and costs of a massive and prolonged
failure in the continuity of capital circulation will be]{.underline}
[catastrophic and]{.underline} potentially [lethal for a significant
portion of the]{.underline} world's [population]{.underline}. To be
sure, indigenous and peasant populations in the Andean highlands may
survive quite well, but [if the flow of capital shuts down for any
prolonged period,]{.underline} then maybe [two-thirds of the world's
population would within a few weeks be threatened with starvation,
deprived of fuel and light, while being rendered immobile and deprived
of almost all capacity to reproduce their conditions of existence
effectively. We cannot now afford any kind of sustained and prolonged
attack upon or disruption of capital circulation even if the more
egregious forms of accumulation are strictly curbed]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} kind of [fantasy that revolutionaries]{.underline}
might [once have had]{.underline} -- which was [that capitalism could be
destroyed and]{.underline} burned down overnight and that [something
different could immediately be built upon the ashes -- **is
impossible**]{.underline} today even supposing there ever was a time
when such a revolutionary overthrow might have happened. [Some
form]{.underline} of the circulation of commodities and therefore of
[money capital has to be kept in motion for some considerable time lest
most of us starve.]{.underline} It is in this sense that we might say
that **[capital appears to be now too big to fail.]{.underline}** We may
aspire to make our own history, Marx observed, but this can never be
done under conditions of our own choosing. [These conditions dictate a
politics that is about sustaining many existing commodity chains and
flows while socializing and]{.underline} perhaps gradually [modifying
them to accommodate to human needs]{.underline}. As Marx noted in his
commentary on the Paris Commune,

in order to work out their own emancipation, and along with it the
higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending by its own
economical agencies, they \[the working classes\] will have to pass
through long struggles, through a series of historic processes,
transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realize, but
to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing
bourgeois society is pregnant.

The task is to identify that which lays latent in our existing society
to find a peaceful transition to a more socialist alternative.
**[Revolution is a long process not an event.]{.underline}**

### Cap sustainable -- resources 

#### Resource limits are irrelevant to growth -- efficiency gains, substitution, and transmutation all disprove their arguments

**Tupy and Deutsch, 2023**

\[Marian, senior fellow at Cato, and David, author, "We Will Never Run
Out Of Resources",
https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-will-never-run-out-of-resources-earth-ocean-tech-knowledge-engineering-e65f88c7,
The Wall Street Journal, 20 July 2023 HDCSW -- JCP\]

The [world's population has increased eightfold since 1800, and
standards of living have never been higher]{.underline}. Despite
increases in consumption, and contrary to the prophecies of generations
of Malthusians, [the world hasn't run out of a single metal or mineral.
In fact, resources have generally grown cheaper relative to income over
the past two centuries. Even on the largest cosmic scale, resources may
well be limitless.]{.underline}

How can a growing population expand resource abundance? Some of the ways
are well known. [Consider increased supply. When the price of a resource
increases, people have an incentive to find new sources of it.
Geologists have surveyed only a fraction of the Earth's crust, let alone
the ocean floor. As surveying and extracting technologies improve,
geologists and engineers will go deeper, faster, cheaper and cleaner to
reach hitherto untouched minerals]{.underline}.

[Efficiency gains also contribute to resource abundance. In the late
1950s an aluminum can weighed close to 3 ounces. Today it weighs less
than half an ounce. That smaller mass represents considerable
environmental, energy and raw-material savings. Market incentives
motivated people to search for opportunities or new knowledge to reduce
the cost of an input (aluminum) to produce a cheaper output]{.underline}
(a Coca-Cola can). Technological improvement drives a continual process
whereby we can produce more from less.

The [supply of minerals is theoretically finite, but human knowledge and
creativity are limitless]{.underline}.

[Innovation creates opportunities for substitution. For centuries
spermaceti, a waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales, was
used to make the candles]{.underline} that provided light in people's
homes. Long [before the whales might have run out, we switched to
electricity. Are you worried about having enough lithium to power all
those electric vehicles on the road? Quick-charging sodium-ion batteries
are already on the horizon. There is far more sodium than
lithium]{.underline} on or near the surface of the Earth.

[We're living in an era of dematerialization]{.underline}. Not long ago,
every hotel room in the U.S. was equipped with a thick blue copper cable
to connect the guest's laptop to the internet. Nowadays guests use
Wi-Fi---no cables necessary. Likewise, [the smartphone has minimized, if
not eliminated, the need for paper calendars, maps, dictionaries and
encyclopedias as well as for metal or plastic radios, cameras,
telephones, stereos, alarm clocks and more.]{.underline}

Perhaps less appreciated is that [apart from a minuscule amount of
aluminum and titanium that we have shot into outer space, all of our
material resources are still here on Earth. Vast quantities of steel may
have been "used" to build our skyscrapers, and copper in power cables,
but all that metal could be recovered and reassigned]{.underline}.
During World War II, 14,000 tons of silver in the U.S. Treasury's West
Point Bullion Depository were made into silver wire for electromagnets
as part of the Manhattan Project. Virtually all of it was eventually
returned.

Common sense implies that since no physical resource is infinite, the
cupboard will eventually grow bare. Given ever-increasing consumption,
we will reach a level where all useful atoms are physically incorporated
into objects that make life enjoyable. Won't economic growth plateau or
reverse course entirely at that point? [You can't have unlimited growth
on a planet with a finite number of atoms. Or can you?]{.underline}

[This argument has no bearing on any real resource issue. It invokes a
hypothetical future when we are mining the Earth's very core for rare
elements and draining its oceans to sustain billions of thirsty humans.
This is so far in the future as not to be relevant to any present-day
policies or planning. Today, the bottleneck isn't physical resources but
knowledge of how to use them to our benefit. Not just theoretical
knowledge but down-to-earth, practical engineering
knowledge]{.underline}. We need to improve that as fast as we can.

For millennia, learned people and charlatans dreamed of transmuting
elements. In 1919 physicist Ernest Rutherford achieved the first
artificial transmutation by turning nitrogen into oxygen. [Today,
transmutation is all around us]{.underline}. Smoke detectors contain
americium, an artificial element produced by transmutation. Nuclear
physicists achieved the transmutation of lead into gold decades ago,
though the process requires far too much energy to be a viable
alternative to mining.

But [the cost of energy is bound to fall. The sun is effectively a
nuclear fusion reactor converting millions of tons of mass into energy
every second. Someday soon we will be able to capture as much of that
energy as we like via super-efficient solar panels. The difficulty won't
be harvesting that energy but getting rid of waste heat by radiating it
into space. We may find it more convenient to make our own fusion
reactors. All the elements found on Earth other than hydrogen and helium
were made by transmutation in various kinds of stars. In the distant
future, we could use artificial fusion not only for energy but for
artificial transmutation, to make whatever elements we like. All we need
is abundant energy and hydrogen, which is plentiful in the water that
covers most of the Earth's surface and is the most common element in the
universe]{.underline}.

Long before humans have extracted all the useful atoms in the Earth's
crust and oceans, [we will develop the technological sophistication to
obtain vastly more atoms and energy from asteroids, planets and beyond.
In that future, just as has always been the case, the only bottleneck
will be the rate at which new knowledge can be created]{.underline}. And
nothing prevents us from improving that rate too. [Knowledge is the
ultimate resource]{.underline} and there are no limits on creating it.

For starters[, megatrends are vague.]{.underline} And that\'s [the main
reason they sound so convincing and inevitable.]{.underline} They\'re
seductive, just like horoscopes: \"There will be about 1 billion more of
us by 2030, and we will live longer\" (Winston 2019). Can\'t argue with
that. \"With relentless planet Mars at the helm, an investment, real
estate, or financial matter could pay dividends, but it will come with
many demands\" (ELLE 2020). I can see that happening. But so what? That
[there might be \"about 1 billion more of us by 2030,\" or that \"an
investment\... could pay dividends.. with many demands,\" leaves us
dan-gling.]{.underline} Like horoscopes, the first problem with
[megatrends]{.underline} is that [despite]{.underline} their [sounding
so satisfying and compelling, they\'re just too nebulous to take
meaningful actions.]{.underline}

In Megatrends, the book that started it all, author John Naisbitt begins
by stating that none of the 10 transformations his book is about \"is
more subtle, yet more explosive . .. than the shift from an industrial
to an information society\" (Naisbitt 1982, p. 11). He was right. And?
He failed to predict not only the iPhone but the Macintosh computer
(\"the Mac\"), the World Wide Web, Internet of Things, radio frequency
identification (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), and social
media-the meaningful inventions to which we really need to pay heed and
that have caused, and will continue to cause, major changes in how we
live.

But it gets worse---a lot worse. That\'s because [megatrends are
frequently wrong-way wrong]{.underline}. In 1956, legendary
[geologist]{.underline} [M. King Hubbert predicted that US petroleum
production would peak in 1970 with oil running out in 2015]{.underline}
(Novak 2014). [In]{.underline} his best-selling 1968 book, [The
Population Bomb, Stanford biologist Dr. Paul Ehrlich pre-dicted, \"The
battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of
millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs
embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial
increase in the world death rate\"]{.underline} (Ehrlich 1968, p. 11).
Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences,
published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves
and estimated that humanity would totally run out of copper shortly
after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990
(Brown 1970). Needless to say, none of it happened.

In his book More from Less, Andrew McAfee, principal research scientist
at MIT Sloan School of Management, suggests technology and capitalism
are why predictions of the future are frequently so terribly wrong.
Essentially, [humans invent things to empower themselves and subvert
material shortages, while capitalism-Schumpeter\'s \"creative
destruction]{.underline}\" (Alm and Cox 2020) [fueled by capitalism\'s
price mechanism that allocates resources to their most highly valued
use-takes them mainstream.]{.underline} Together [they\'re why
megatrends get derailed. It\'s why and how we invent ways to grow more
food, find more oil, and better use materials.]{.underline}

[Competition is]{.underline} the other [vital attribute of a capitalist
system.]{.underline} [Private businesses compete to provide consumers
with goods and services that are better, faster, and
cheaper.]{.underline} The principle of [competition forces businesses to
maximize
[efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiency.asp) and
offer their products at the lowest prices the market will
bear,]{.underline} lest they get put out of business by more efficient
and better-priced competitors. In terms of producing quality products,
many criticisms have been levied against capitalism for promoting
low-quality goods and services in exchange for higher profits, which may
result in overall harm to society and the environment.1

Nevertheless, [doing business with a particular company in a capitalist
system is voluntary.]{.underline} The central government in a [communist
system]{.underline}, though, [has effective
[monopolies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp) in all
industries]{.underline}. This means it has [no direct profit incentive
to operate efficiently or provide low prices because its
customers]{.underline} [do not have the option of looking
elsewhere,]{.underline} although other incentives may exist.

Ecosocialist degrowth transitions would most likely occur in a context
of deepening political-economic crisis, intensifying climate shocks, and
worsening insecurity for the majority of populations. A key danger,
then, is that even in the best-case scenario in which powerful red-green
movements decisively shift the balance of power vis-à-vis capital and
elect leftist parties following ecosocialist platforms, this could lead
to "authoritarian" forms of ecosocialism, understood as ecosocialist
regimes that institutionalize "state of emergency" provisions such as
unchecked executive power, the suspension of democratic rights and
procedures, restrictions on free speech, and military-police repression
of dissent (Petras and Fitzgerald Citation1988). This has of course been
one of the primary challenges confronting all socialist transitions
historically, which have had to fight off external military
intervention, resistance from capitalist elites, and reactionary
currents from below in order to protect revolutionary gains. Things
would be no different for future ecosocialisms-in-transition,
particularly given the likely contradiction between the speed at which
consumption cuts may need to be made in the global north and the
slowness with which post-materialist cultural change would occur, yet
such problems have not been systematically explored by ecosocialists and
degrowth scholars. The risks are twofold: first, that authoritarian
measures would be needed to enforce lifestyle changes upon recalcitrant
populations and "deal with the exceptional circumstances of direct and
serious threat" to the survival of ecosocialist regimes in their early
phases; and second, that such measures, rather than being temporally
limited and abolished once the "exceptional circumstances" are dealt
with, become the new normal (94).

Quincy Saul and Andreas Malm are among the few ecosocialists who don't
shy away from this problem. Saul, for one, writes that "a period of
'emergency rule,' when the expropriators are expropriated, must be
revised for the twenty-first century, it cannot be dismissed or glossed
over" (Saul Citation2011, 58--59). Similarly, Malm suggests that
carrying out the transition in the needed time frame would require.

warlike state management of all industries ... centralized decisions on
who can consume what goods in what amounts, \[and\] punishment of
transgressors threatening the annual emissions targets ... \[which\] can
only be feasible under an exceptional regime dealing with an unheard-of
emergency (Malm Citation2015, 187)

The risk, in other words, is that ecosocialist regimes that are
democratically elected in a context of unprecedented
climate-energy-economic crises may be forced down an authoritarian path
in order to enforce carbon rationing, enact rapid and far-reaching
transformations in land-use, break through the gridlock of dysfunctional
and polarized legislatures, and defend themselves against violence and
sabotage from capitalist elites and the far-right. The danger is
exacerbated by the fact that worsening climate and political-economic
crises, far from neutralizing the threat of rightwing populism, will
most likely intensify ethnonationalist reaction and political
polarization. As Malm and the Zetkin Collective explain: "the higher the
temperatures, the more acute the antagonism between a left that alone
stands ready to pick up the instruments for alleviating the crisis and a
right that, for that very reason, refuses to contemplate it" (Malm and
Collective Citation2021, 286--287). Additionally, given that
ecosocialist transitions would entail a "life-threatening situation" for
most if not all sectors of the capitalist class, many of them would
likely ally with the far-right in order to halt such transitions in
their tracks and restore capitalist power "by any means necessary"
(241). Thus even in the best-case scenario in which ecosocialists are
able to assume power in core states, this would almost certainly occur
in a context of rabid far-right resistance in alliance with global
capital. The risks are particularly acute in, but not limited to, the
US, where the spectacle of armed insurrectionists storming congress to
try overthrowing the 2020 presidential election give us a taste of what
ecosocialists are up against.

[Here's a pop quiz. Which of these three environmental solutions is the
best?]{.underline}

[Number one: ecosocialism]{.underline}. It's essentially socialism with
a spicy climate kick. A larger government places more restrictions on
private companies --- higher carbon taxes, let's say --- and
nationalizes any decision-making with profound environmental impacts.
All oil could be government-owned and leased out as needed to make fuel.
Private citizens could be restricted from buying land with any
ecological value.

Second candidate[: degrowth. A loose coalition of diverse viewpoints
with one shared anchor, a conviction that economic growth cannot
continue forever]{.underline}. Eventually, we will deplete so much of
Earth's natural resources that the planet will have nothing left to
give. We need to stop --- or at least greatly reduce --- industrial
activity before that happens. Saito, who believes degrowth is best
aligned with Marx's original position, says we must stop buying those
destructive, extravagant and wasteful products. We lose some material
luxuries, but now we can finally make decisions collectively for the
health of the planet.

[Last but not least: the circular economy. The free market continues to
exist, but companies design their products to be recycled, repurposed
and restored rather than replaced]{.underline}. Finite raw materials are
reused instead of winding up in landfills. The demand for natural
resources diminishes, reducing the power of extractive industries. We
all work co-operatively to share our limited resources, which encourages
democracy and community solidarity.\
Spoiler alert: there is no right answer. It's a trick question. The
options overlap. A socialist economy isn't immune to overproduction, so
some limits on resource extraction are still needed. Degrowth can't
happen overnight --- we'll need to make the transition to reusing our
existing stock of plastics and metals slowly. And mutual aid is never
going to happen at scale without some kind of government enforcement.

[But when you start pulling this thread, you find more camps than you
thought possible. There are doughnut economists, eco-communists,
eco-anarchists and many more. People within environmental movements
exhibit a range of pro- and anti-capitalist ideologies,]{.underline}
says Amy Janzwood, a political and environmental scientist at McGill
University in Montreal. Among the oil pipeline protests she studies, she
sees both NIMBY land owners who want their property values preserved and
Indigenous land de- fenders fighting against colonial views of property.

"[Regardless of the terminology we use, it's incredibly important to
think about the foundations that underpin what the future could look
like," Janzwood says. "If we don't have a clear sense of the complex
causes of the problems that we are currently wrestling with, then we
won't have a good idea of how to move beyond them."]{.underline}
