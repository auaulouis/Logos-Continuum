[I don't know what it is about this day and age, but wherever I go in
this world,]{.underline} **[I always end up being surrounded by so many
Qallunaat of all persuasions]{.underline}**. This reality usually gives
me a strange feeling, and I get a little scared at times. How did this
ever happen to an innocent Eskimo such as I?

I do not mean to offend any of my Qallunaat friends here, but perhaps
you will understand better why I feel a little apprehensive standing and
speaking in front of you. A trailblazer I am not, but at least allow me
to be a great pretender.

[Let me speak, for a moment, of my fellow Inuit of the recent
past]{.underline}, who were rendered by outside forces a fated people
thrown collectively for a loop into an uncertain future. Their long
history as a nomadic people living in one of the world\'s largest deep
freezers has now proven their traditional culture and heritage were
destined for a wholesale change. This change left behind, in its wake,
victims whose sense of Eskimo reality was irreversibly altered by
cultural upheaval.

**[As a people, when the first wave of settlers came to their domain,
they did not have any immunity to an infection not unlike the
flesh-eating disease, streptococcus A bacteria. This disease, fatal as
it can sometimes be, was somehow prevented from doing further gorging on
the already minuscule Inuit population]{.underline}**. [However, even at
this late hour, the fall-out from the recent cultural explosion is still
vibrating through the lives of four generations of Inuit. **And what was
their devious crime? Just being culturally different with a distinct
ideology far removed from those of the settlers.**]{.underline} Whoever
thought curiosity didn\'t come with a price has gone the way of Franklin
and his forlorn men. None of us are deaf, dumb, and blind to the fact
that if there is a buck to be made, the salesman will be at your door
with a brand new deep freezer in hand, or for that matter, the eternally
infamous, and the latest edition, of a vacuum cleaner. What wondrous
technological, and engineering, achievements these are! The Eskimo will
love \'em. The latest blue millionaire is born. [Never mind that the
salesman also happened to be a huckster working for a blue-blooded
descendant from the former British Empire]{.underline}.

I well remember the heady days when me and my family slowly got up early
each morning in the dark dampness of the igloo, our eyelids still stuck
shut with the fluid that had soured and become pasty during the night.
The fluid had actually been teardrops left over from the previous day\'s
loss of an animal we should have since devoured to help replenish our
bodies, and therefore, our minds.

**[Each day was a struggle full of hope that bounty was waiting for us
in one of those seal breathing holes on the vast sea ice]{.underline}**.
[Our dogged determination to survive will never be understood by those
who did not keep company with us when out stomachs yearned for their
latest salvation]{.underline}. **[Not even the greatest of Arctic
narrators, I believe, will ever come close to interpreting the anguish
we nomads felt when each day dawned and darkness fell at the end of the
day.]{.underline}** Our only saving grace was to continue dreaming about
the feast that had once again eluded us.

I have read many good Arctic yarns spun out by the so-called giants of
Canadian Lit., such as Farley Mowat, who, despite his deep earnestness
as an Arctic narrator, was inadvertently trapped into Arctic folklore as
a writer some Inuit are fond of referring to---in friendly Eskimo terms,
of course---as \"Farley Mowat, Hardly Knowit.\" Do not despair, my
fellow interpreter of the imagination, even after living in Ottawa for
nearly thirty years, the Qallunaat still earnestly call me, \"Alootook
Ipellie Hardlyknowit.\" What a vile civilization we live in. Aside from
this harsh reality, I have been waiting, all these years, for another of
Farley\'s incredible recipes for those delectable Barren Lands Mice. I
am still in culinary heaven, ever since I first tried his recipe for
\"Creamed Mice.\" Except in my case, I substituted Tundra Lemmings.

One of our godfathers of Canadian Lit., Pierre Berton, undoubtedly
toiled, long and hard, into many a late \"Arctic\" night, retelling the
trials and tribulations of both the heroic and infamous in his book, The
Arctic Grail. Even after coming out with an incredible narrative of
Arctic lore, Peeta has always been an enigma in the very Arctic he has
written about. Is it only me, or are there others out there, who have
never heard of him actually setting foot onto the Arctic tundra? If this
is the case, my speculation is his trademark bow tie may have rendered
him an illegal alien in the land of the fur-clad Eskimos. If Douglas
Adams can write The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy, then Peeta is a
welcome addition to a band of Arctic narrators from the alien galaxy of
the Qallanaaq. Beam me up, Scotty

Some years ago, after reading the Preface to \'\'The Collected Poems of
Al Purdy,\" I was happy to learn Al and I had several things in common.
One, is our first name, since I usually introduce myself as \"Al\" to
the Qallunaat who are, quite literally, incapable of speaking in a
guttural voice like so many of us Inuit are wont to do. Second, we both
like to write poems. Third, we share a mutual enjoyment of a beer or
two, although, at this point in my life, I can only claim to have filled
a mid-sized lake in southern Baffin Island. Not to worry, Attikuluk (my
name-sake), I will soon be able to boast to one and all that I, too,
will not be able to ever see the shore again from my rowboat from all
the beer I have drunk in my lifetime

\"Hello, Margaret Atwood!\"

Upon opening Rudy Wiebe\'s, Playing Dead: A Contemplation Concerning the
Arctic, there is a map of Canada entitled, \"Inuit View to the South,\"
showing how the south appears when viewed from the North Pole. The map
throws your sense of equilibrium out the door after being so used to
looking at a so-called \"upright\" map of Canada, as seen by Qallunaat
from the south. I immediately thought of Rudy as a genius for having
come up with an aptly titled book (although, in his case, the title
derives from an Inuit legend). What a revelation! The south really does
look like that when you are very dead and looking at the world below
from your little perch in Heaven. I had better get used to looking at
this \"Inuit view to the South\" in readiness for whenever I am destined
to meet the Divinity. What an optimistic Eskimo I am. But, to me, Rudy
will forever be a diviner. He travelled to the Arctic and foresaw the
future.

John Moss. Here is a writer who certainly will never be referred to as a
\"mossback\" as far as interpretation of the Arctic landscape is
concerned. Mr. Moss has certainly travelled the ruggedness, as well as
the plainness, of the Arctic landscape. He has done it over a time span
of many moons in the moonless Arctic summers, and for that matter, in
daylight that refused to retire for days on end. He has also done it on
the backs of so many others who travelled the Arctic landscape before
him. Oh, how their mighty words drew his curiosity and he, too, had to
find out how it felt to be reincarnated as an Inummariq, a real Inuk.
**[The ghosts of the previous Arctic, explored, were visible everywhere
he went.]{.underline}** The welltrodden trails snake their way in the
valleys, over countless hills, and along numerous beaches. [The Arctic
seas echo still with the wailing cries of once proud men who were
swallowed by the mighty Arctic seas. They were certainly defiant to
their last breath, only to surrender to the almightiness of nature; all
humble men.]{.underline} Mr. Moss, who possesses enduring Arctic dreams,
has lemmings in his pants that want to go along with the next voyage of
discovery. And up to this day, he has covered only the first leg of his
long Arctic journey ahead. We envy you, sir. However, let me take you
back to your Katannilik Journals for Wednesday, July 29, 1992 (\"It\'s
hard to make love on the tundra . . .\"). Without pretending macho, I
have had similar experiences over the years. I am not saying that I am
an expert in such predicaments, but perhaps we can at least compare
notes and learn from one another.

[**And so, there are countless other Arctic narrators who have all been,
more or less, intellectually lured by the incredible Arctic and its
hardy and resourceful people, the Inuit who were made to settle down.
The myth and mystique of the polar lands has summoned countless men from
far-off lands, some of whom came to their unfortunate final end on what
turned out to be such an unforgiving land.** No living generation of
Arctic narrators will ever get enough satisfaction out of spinning yarns
about the Arctic and its cast of thousands, from the bygone days to this
very moment. **I am standing here in front of you to announce,
unfortunately, that none of us will ever live long enough to finally
complete the elusive final book on the Arctic and its people, or any
facsimile of them. The Great White Arctic will remain an unfinished
story to the very end of human habitation on planet Earth. How
sad.**]{.underline}

#### Exploration of the Arctic is traditionally imagined as a [harsh environment]{.underline} for [European heroes]{.underline} to conquer, [whitewashing]{.underline} indigenous cosmologies.

However, the Arctic differed from Antarctica in being an histor- ically
inhabited region that formed part of the economies and cultural
imaginations of northern Atlantic states[. Although it was a region
well- visited by explorers,]{.underline} whalers and missionaries, **[a
good part of being in the Arctic meant experiencing spectral
moments,]{.underline}** of seeing the familiar become the strange and of
having to work out how absent people seemed to have presence.
Remembering an 1880 whaling trip in The Strand, Arthur Conan Doyle tried
to put some bones on this spectrality, writing of the 'peculiar other-
world feeling of the Arctic regions -- a feeling so singular, that if
you have once been there the thought of it haunts you all your life'
(2012, 333). Linear narratives of geographic achievement or failure,
then, were only the beginnings of the cultural appreciation for Arctic
exploration. [Ghostly experiences meant a lot to explorers and their
audiences]{.underline}. **[These stories, and the dream- work they
represent, enrich our understanding of exploration as a complex set of
practices that did not simply involve the activities of explorers in the
field.]{.underline}**

[Today the Arctic is no longer merely thought of as a space of geo-
graphical distance and difference; rather issues of climate change, oil
and gas resources and cultural loss dominate the way the region appears
in the international media]{.underline}. Yet the language of the magical
Arctic, so prominent among narrators in the nineteenth century, has
retained its allure among contemporary scholars, newspaper editors and
writers. So [it behoves us to look at what fertilised this
language.]{.underline} **[Where does it come from and what does it mean
for our historical understandings of Arctic exploration?]{.underline}**
What happens when we move beyond describing the consumption of Arctic
enchantments and start to delve deeper into the actual dreams of
explorers, archiving their ghost stories and mapping their reveries?

[The overall aim of this book is to **re- think some of the stories that
explorers, readers and consumers told themselves about Arctic
exploration**.]{.underline} In researching the topic, I have visited
relevant archives and libraries but I have also accessed newspaper and
periodical materials that have only recently been digitised. This has
uncovered a fresh range of sources that have allowed me to take quite a
different approach to what has become relatively well- trodden ground.
In what follows I move from well- known accounts of Arctic expeditions
to lesser known stories, from events that took place in the Arctic to
the imaginative forces trav- elling from different parts of the British
Empire. Taken together, my explorations of the spectral Arctic present
new ways of reading trad- itional accounts of exploration and
resuscitate reports, stories and other neglected narratives about
ghostly or dreamlike travel in the Arctic.

[One inherent value in this approach is that it fundamentally questions
the standard narrative of polar exploration, which recounts how a
rational male hero either conquers or is conquered by an inani- mate and
alien nature]{.underline}. While this challenge might sound like old
news, every week articles and books continue to be published that
**[rehearse the familiar 'heroic man versus harsh environment' myth.
Although this myth still influences commentary on Antarctica, such
'whitewashing' is more disturbing when it appears in work on Arctic
exploration, where it is still common for indigenous people to be
written- out of expeditions, or appear only as background actors in a
Eurocentric drama.]{.underline}** Such a per- vasive dichotomy not only
ignores the everyday dreaming and religious or 'superstitious' behaviour
which explorers carried with them, but it also obscures the messy
spiritual values that were sensed by people in polar landscapes, whether
through atmospheric phenomena such as the Aurora Borealis or the
embodied spiritual journeys of Inuit shamans and British clairvoyants
across vast distances**[. Both Inuit oral testimonies and the published
journals of explorers tell us that shamanism and spiritual forces played
a key role in the encounters between strangers in the Arctic, as did
Inuit guides, interpreters and map- makers.]{.underline}**

#### The Arctic is imagined as a "dark and cold" place through a settler worldview. Settler methods of developing and exploring the Arctic rely on a legal land-focus approach to claim ownership and enact immeasurable colonial violence on indigenous people.

[I begin with land as analytic before turning to water and
ice]{.underline}. Land has been asked to hold multitudes across much
conceptual terrain. To show the fullness of ice and how it traffics
across analytical formations of land and water, I must acknowledge
critical genealogies and colonial trap- pings of land- based concepts
first. [The articulations of land that I explore crop up within and
against settler law, encroachment and occupation, and under the
technologies of measurement and surveillance. Those]{.underline}
**[colo- nial projects shape how ice can be understood, related to, and
discussed, especially in strategic formulations by Native peoples in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** [To sit with ice thoroughly and rigorously we
need to visit with land as well as water.]{.underline} The aim is not
only to better understand ice but to think these relational elements and
their ongoing critical histories together toward possible coalition.

L A N D

**[Land animates core elements of Native politics, Native livelihoods,
Native histories, and Native futures]{.underline}**. "[**Land" functions
as a kind of shorthand for the many distinct historical, ontological,
and juridical relationships Native peoples,** communities, and polities
negotiate and maintain with beings, materialities, and landscapes that
are not human.]{.underline} Native authors, scholars, and thinkers have
long demonstrated how land operates as con- cept and material.1 **[As
Eve Tuck and Marcia McKenzie write, Indigenous theoretical and
conceptual formulations of land "derive from entirely dif- ferent
epistemological and cosmological foundations, and, thus, cannot be
easily combined or absorbed into Western argumentations.]{.underline}**
They come from, and go to, a different place." 2 Land is not only simple
measurable, observable ecological matter, though that is part of land
too.

[Land is central to Native communities, polities, and individuals in
ways that languages of coloniality, and often the academy, are not capa-
cious enough to reflect.]{.underline}3 **[The centrality of land did not
begin with, nor can it be usurped by, colonialism or colonial
actors.]{.underline}** As Joanne Barker puts it, "Indigenous land is not
capitalism's land," it is not "land as prop- erty within European and
North American legal philosophy and practice . . . \[or\] as an
inheritable patrilineal estate with intergenerational wealth and caste-
making properties . . . and cannot be equated or reduced to the property
of European and North American legal philosophy and prac- tice." 4
[While colonial agents and pressures continue to try to work Indig-
enous land into ahistorical property, this reduction and abstraction can
never be completed]{.underline}.

**[Instead, land is both context and process; it is the ground on which
and the context in which storytelling makes meaning of the
world]{.underline}**.5 Mish- uana Goeman describes land as "a meaning-
making place because that is at the heart of indigenous identity,
longing, and belonging. Indige- nous peoples make place by relating both
personal and communal expe- riences and histories to certain locations
and landscapes--- maintaining these spatial relationships is one of the
most important components of politics and our identity." 6 [If land is
central to Native communities across geographies, this shapes why land
is a central analytic in Native American and Indigenous studies
scholarship]{.underline}. **[The centrality of land to Native life is
also why colonial projects work to dispossess Native peoples of their
lands again and again through projects of ongoing
occupation.]{.underline}** The cen- tralization of land is iterative and
seemingly always urgent and neces- sary for Native peoples. As poet
Layli Long Soldier puts it, "I don't trust nobody / but the land." 7

This reality does not come without insistence that perhaps Native
studies scholarship has been overdetermined by a focus on land,8 as
might likewise be true of scholarship more broadly that is interested in
environmental questions. An overwhelming centralization of land then
comes to determine conceptually and theoretically the bounds of several
academic fields. [Scholars demonstrate how an overemphasis in the ter-
restrial and in grounded, fixed units of analysis have simplified the
sur- face of Earth as something planar and not volumetric.]{.underline}9
**[Technologies like mapping, land allotment, colonial borders, and
property rights are under girded by the imagined ability to measure land
definitively, to define and to separate one part of unmoving, static
earth from another.]{.underline}** The tools of land measurement are
compromised by their purported objectivity in documenting material in
its totality. Too often the theoretical tools of scholarship also make
space and place flat, passive, or geometric.10 **[Which, of course, is a
false oversimplification of land]{.underline}**.

[Land as flattened geometry is just one part of the issue. As Meredith
Palmer argues**, the metrics of measuring land are embroiled with**
histo- ries of anti- Indigenous racism in what she calls **"the racist
acre."**]{.underline} 11 **[Colo- nial and imperial tools and tactics of
measuring and observing land try to make it into inanimate materiality
for capitalist accumulation, sacri- fice, and often abandonment over and
against Indigenous relationships.]{.underline}**12 Max Liboiron,
following Sandra Styres and Dawn Zinga, has described that process as
one of making Land into land.13 In this formulation, [Land refers to
"the unique entity that is the combined living spirit of plants,
animals, air, water, humans, histories, and events recognized by many
Indigenous communities. When land is not capitalized \[land\] refers to
the concept from a colonial worldview whereby landscapes are common,
universal, and everywhere, even with great variation."]{.underline} 14
Capital L Land is relations; small l land is resource. Tuck and McKenzie
write correctly, then, that "Indigenous intellectual contributions
rarely fail to engage in issues of land and place--- especially via
conceptualizations of tribal identity, sovereignty, and treaty rights---
yet when these discussions are taken up by non- Indigenous and settler
scholars, the saliency of land and place is frequently left out of the
picture." 15 [Put another way, it is not simply a problem
that]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}** [is flattened into passive
static space through technology and narrative alike, but that
those]{.underline} [**flattenings** are also the]{.underline}
**[overlooking, undermining, and an attempted severing of Native sover-
eignties and relationships]{.underline}**. [Staying attentive to the
ways that land has been designated, measured, surveilled, and documented
through tech- nologies that are anti- Indigenous demonstrate the need by
Native think- ers to continue to describe and reclaim land
relationalities in scholarship and in practice.]{.underline}16

Enactments of colonialism also coerce Native peoples to regard, dis-
cuss, and interact with land in strategic formulations. Often, those
strat- egies are necessarily iterative, as colonialism is as historical
as it is a contemporary project, maintaining and making itself [**anew.
Native poli- ties, communities, and individuals have had to employ**
what Gayatri Spi- vak has called "**strategic essentialism" to keep
homelands under Native governance**.]{.underline}17 **[This is not
always how Native people may want to formu- late relationships to their
lands.]{.underline}** [Federal and state sponsored colonial projects are
often beyond the control and purview of Native peoples, communities, and
polities, such as allotment and property- making, iden- tity regimes of
blood quantum calculations, removal and relocation from homelands, theft
of children and placement into boarding schools, pollu- tion, and
environmental racism**. These are all colonial land relations that most
often require(d) military force and simultaneous if not subsequen- tial
bureaucratic violences.**]{.underline} As Michelle Daigle has written,
"Theorizations of colonial conquest, resistance, and liberation require
interrogations of the fixed spatialities and temporalities that
Indigenous peoples continue to be relegated to discursively and
materially." 18

**[These ongoing histories]{.underline}** [not only continue to shape
the lives and poli- tics of Native peoples who relate to more temperate
lands, they also]{.underline} **[shape the ways that ice geographies and
Indigenous Arctic peoples must strat- egize and articulate their
specific relations to ice]{.underline}**. [Arctic Indigenous peo- ples
feel the climate aftermaths of lands extracted and turned inside- out in
more temperate Indigenous territories elsewhere.]{.underline} Indigenous
Arctic ice geographies are often negatively compared to more easily
capitalist- extracted, temperate Indigenous lands further south and
rendered des- olate, empty, or violable. [Yet, as Sheila Watt- Cloutier
writes, "The Arctic may seem cold and dark to those who don't know it
well, but for us a day of hunting or fishing brought the most succulent,
nutritious food. Then there would be the intense joy as we gathered
together as a family and friends, sharing and partaking of the same
animal in a communal meal, to live in a boundless landscape and a close-
knit culture in which every- thing matters. . . .]{.underline} Like
generations of Inuit, I bonded with the ice and snow." 19 In a similar
sentiment to Watt- Cloutier, Leslie Marmon Silko writes in her essay
"Interior and Exterior Landscapes" about relation- ships to desert
places: Hopi Pueblo elders said that the austere and, to some eyes,
barren plains and hills surrounding their mesa- top villages in
northeast Arizona actually help nurture the spirituality of the Hopi way
. . . the Hopi people might have settled in locations far more lush. . .
. But there on the high, silent, sandstone mesas that overlook the
sandy, arid expanses stretching to all horizons, the Hopi elders say the
Hopi people must "live by their prayers." Great abundances of things . .
. tend to lure human attention away from what is most valuable and
important.20 [For Silko the desert offers a relationship that supports
and enriches a spiritual relationship, most important above all in her
sensibility. **Across Silko and Watt- Cloutier, the landscapes of ice
and desert are crucially life- giving and sustaining. Many of the
technologies used to measure and make land into property don't neatly
map onto desert or ice, defying what settler law might try to make of it
or make it into.**]{.underline}

#### This legal land-focus erases indigenous relations to water and ice, producing a feedback loop of legal dispossession and indigenous rights-based movements that maintain indigenous genocide.

Scholarship and research about federal Indian law animates much of
Native studies. **[Law is where land, its dispossession, and colonial
land relations unfold and continue to be enacted.]{.underline}** [Again,
and more impor- tantly, **Native communities have their own legal
systems**, legal obliga- tions, protocols, and practices **that both
predate colonial contact and have been shaped**, maintained, and revised
**in relation** **to gendered colo- nial encroachment and
dispossession**.]{.underline}21 Native peoples' social organiza- tion
and political structures are vast and diverse and preexist any other
form of current federal or state systems of law. [Native studies
analyses recognize this reality and are also interested in the important
ongoing problematics of signed, broken, and unhonored treaties; land
cessions; allotment; the theft of Native children from Native families;
murdered, missing Indigenous women and girls (mmiwg); and myriad land
and water claims processes. **To make claims to land legible to colonial
governments, Native people(s) were often forced and coerced to
articulate themselves and their relationships to land in ways that were
deemed satisfactorily recognizable as Indigenous.**]{.underline} These
regimes of recognition continue into the contemporary moment as some
tribes continue tol seek federal rec- ognition.22 **[Through this
centuries- long process, colonial courts have created a politics of
recognition that require Native peoples to adhere to a definition of
fixedness in space and a long- standing temporal and mate- rial
attachment to land]{.underline}**.23

**[Land must be made recognizable and legible alongside formations of
indigeneity and race, which often excludes entities like ice, river, and
ocean.]{.underline}** **[Settler legal systems require an articulated
rootedness and fixed- ness in place, countering many Native origin
stories and cosmologies that include ice, water, ocean, and migrations
across and between,24 as well as ongoing Indigenous
mobilities]{.underline}**.25 [Moreover, the **legal legibility** that
**requires stasis and sedentarism** simultaneously necessitates Western
forms of cultivation and agriculture through fertile soil and ground in
which to root--- **something that ice geographies cannot
lend**]{.underline}. Indigenous peoples must be made legible through
settler law, and so must land, and that rendering legible of land and
peoples are related processes. The artic- ulation of land, race, and
political subjectivity through law iterated in documents like treaties
and land claims settlements later shape how ice and Indigenous peoples
who live with or near ice are juridically under- stood or misunderstood.
**[The strategic deployments of land can have deleterious consequences
for peoples of water and ice who aim to use similar legal avenues toward
care of relations.]{.underline}**

The strategic, and often necessary, utilization of accepted colonial
interpretation of what counts as land and land relations has resulted in
keeping some homelands intact, yet it is not without consequences. As
Goeman writes, To claim land, it is set up through the court systems
that we must claim difference from settlers. In our pursuit to
differentiate our- selves from settler colonists, we have
territorialized land and body. **[The legal tensions between stability
and static versus change, adap- tation, and growth are very real for
indigenous people]{.underline}**. They are in a particularly difficult
political situation in which recognition of cul- tural and racial
uniqueness is detrimental to the overall physical and cultural survival
of indigenous people.26 [These kinds of land relations framed through a
categorical difference from whiteness as enforced and determined by
settler law are at once the mechanism that allows Native peoples to
claim their land and also creates harm in an identification of self and
community.]{.underline} The original moment of articulating difference
from colonists to make claims to homeland is not a singular event. This
difference must be reiterated over time to maintain access to land and
things like treaty rights[. Legal relationships to land are also not
homogenous.]{.underline}

[**The opportunity to legally claim** difference from colonists as
prece- dent for]{.underline} **[land claims and land
rights,]{.underline}** [such as in Alaska, Hawaii, and in many places in
California, **does not always exist. In many places, no trea- ties were
signed, and there is no legal or priority access for Native peo- ples to
their land relations**. In Alaska, legal conflict over what are called
"subsistence rights" (access to whaling, fishing, hunting, and
gathering) continues into the contemporary moment]{.underline}. When
Alaska Native peo- ple demonstrated and lobbied for their subsistence
rights, those rights were denied by state legislature as
unconstitutional, race- based privi leges. Herein lies one dimension of
the problematic identified by Goeman: when rights are articulated
through racial difference in settler courts, they can also be denied on
those same grounds. [However, in the case of Alaska, the denial of
subsistence rights flies in the face of subsistence access legally
falling under the auspices of federal Indian law, not a state- level
decision.27]{.underline}

**[Anti- Indigeneity that operates to remove Native peoples from their
lands continues the need to further centralize the importance of
land]{.underline}**. This need, unfortunately, also potentially
minimizes conceptual space allowed for water and ice and an analysis of
how these elements cannot come into categorial formation in ways that
land is afforded. [**Put another way, the colonial category of land as
easily measured or captured by tech- nology and law can disallow other
categories and relations, like water and ice, to be claimed.** Thus,
Native studies must continue to support Native polities' processes of
land reclamation while simultaneously con- testing the legitimacy of
settler- colonial governments to determine such meanings.]{.underline}
The urgency within the field toward land reflects the urgency of the
politics on the ground. **[The feedback loop of land relations, land
theft, land rights, land claims, land back, land scholarship is a loop
pre- cisely because of the ongoing elements of land dispossession and
enacted coloniality.]{.underline}** Moreover, because of the precarity
around land disposses- sion and the need to continually articulate land
relations in forms legi- ble to settler courts, scholarship in Native
studies that pushes inquiries around reframing land differently can be
read as dangerous and poten- tially against grounded movements. With
this important reality in mind, I worry about the colonial grounding of
the concept of land that forces it to carry everything we ask it to.
**[We need to blur the boundaries of these orderings and
categories.]{.underline}**

If colonial insistence on the unmoving category of the terrestrial might
undermine water and ice in some ways, water and ice can also help break
those categories. As Philip Steinberg and Kimberley Peters write,
**["State ontology . . . is profoundly terrestrial. . . . The modern
state system is premised on a distinction between solid land and liquid
sea . . . ice confuses and complicates acts of territorial and sovereign
con- trol]{.underline}**. . . . The three- dimensional extent of the sea
. . . makes observation and knowledge, and therefore geopolitical
control, problematic." 28 Ice is land, ice is not land. Non- Native
juridical systems and cartography along with other property regimes
built to dispossess Native land have never been capacious enough to
represent the full contours of Indigenous rela tionships.29 [Due to the
hyperattention land is given, there is little legal recourse with which
to strategically claim other forms as relations and beings.]{.underline}
There have been several outstanding examples against the trend, such as
the Yurok Tribe granting legal personhood to the Klamath River in 2019;
Mutehekau Shipu (Magpie River) was declared a legal person by the Innu
Council of Ekuanitshit; and the residents in Orange County, Florida,
voted to grant rights to the Econlockhatchee and Wekiva Rivers. Outside
of the United States and Canada, Native polities and communi- ties are
using legal realms in creative ways to claim and protect waters. In
Aotearoa in 2017, the Whanganui River was granted legal personhood
status following the efforts and mobilizing of Māori.

In the following pages, I'm concerned with how such relations and beings
have been taken up centrally across Black Diaspora studies and Oceania
studies. I co- theorize with intellectuals and experts whose con-
ceptualizations and labors, in relation to their communities, are meant
to somehow be separate from ruminations on land and ice. In my ask to
build alliance, I wish to recognize that these formulations to water,
land, and ice are distinct and varied but certainly not unrelated.
**[Land, water, and ice thought together insist that to know land we
must also know water--- not a new formulation to many Black and
Indigenous thinkers across time--- and to know land and water we must
also know ice.]{.underline}**

[Ice is a shelter, a feather, a firn. Ice is a needle, a candle, an egg.
Ice takes form in relation to enveloping weather conditions. Ice is
fast, brash, fra- zil, pancake. **Land, marine, airborne.**]{.underline}

Ice as constituted by snow is simultaneously ordered and open, rela-
tional and diverse in its presenting forms. Snow by design is a lattice
of hexagonal rings. [A snowflake a six- sided crystal. Six outstretched
arms, six projecting branches reaching.]{.underline} Bubbles of
emptiness, hollow ice plates, empty columns, rimed and ridged and
ribbed.

Snow is porous, and its open spaces catch sound, absorbing and snag-
ging conversations, chirps, and footsteps. [**Ice amplifies sound,
reflecting waves to make a whisper into a shout.** Water devours sound,
gulping it into its mouth]{.underline}. **[Ice is a
metal]{.underline}**. Pure ice is transparent, but air bubbles ren- der
it opaque. Ice renders air visible. [Ice absorbs every other color
except blue, which it reflects, as it does in a similar way to solar
energy.]{.underline}

Ice heaves, it creeps, it breaks, it seals. Some forms of ice emerge by
accumulation, through the transformation of thousands of snowflakes
recrystallizing into larger, solid compacted ice crystals. [**Ice is a
mineral; glacier is a rock. Ice is plastic**--- it metamorphoses in
response to the set- tling pressure bearing down upon it. Ice oozes,
stretches under its own weight. Ice is of the sea, but it is not
saline]{.underline}. **[Sea ice is emergent out of rela- tions with
tide, winds, and temperature.]{.underline}**

**[Ice erodes, it scratches, it carries, collects, and
bestows.]{.underline}** Ice is erratic, plucking boulders and depositing
a record of movement, carving bowls, melt into lakes and tarns, kettles
and drumlins. Tracks: pits and pocks. [Glaciers surge, retreat, repeat;
flow uphill even when perceived as static or unmoving. Ice is constantly
in motion.]{.underline}

**[Ice can be vapor, water, and solid transitionally]{.underline}**.
[There are eighteen phases of ice, and three types of amorphous ice,
which exist mostly as interstellar materialities. Crashing comets
deposited water and ice onto Earth, not unlike Mars, Mercury, Earth's
moon, and the ice moons of Jupiter and Saturn.]{.underline}

**[Ice geographies are both immense and minute.]{.underline}** Ice
geographies are an ice sheet covering a continent, glaciers hanging from
cliffs that have carved their touch- language into the face of the
Earth, leaving divot and smooth emptiness where ice once was. Ice
geographies are also the crys- talline structure of a single snowflake
that builds expansively upon itself. Ice complicates boundaries and
borders; ice pushes generatively at the analytical, neat containers of
land and ocean, roots and tides.

**[Ice in its nonfixity of place allows and asks for critical,
analytical formulations to emerge that are not universalizing and not
frozen or fixed]{.underline}**. [Aligning with the goals of the book to
carefully guess about **ice,**]{.underline} [this chap- ter is concerned
with how its]{.underline} **[analytical nature brings together heteroge-
nous radical traditions across indigeneity and Blackness, land and
water.]{.underline}** I co- theorize in concert and in solidarity with
scholars and intellectuals across a range and diversity of political
contexts and long- standing rela- tionships to water and land. Ice, too,
asks for these relations to come to the fore, to be brought into relief.
**[Ice as analytic shapes, runs into, with- holds entrance, and is
coerced to make ideas about race and indigeneity, and difference more
broadly. It also exceeds those frameworks.]{.underline}**

[I privilege the Indigenous Arctic and sub- Arctic in North America as a
relational space. I also ask guidance from thinkers from across what's
for- now known as the continental, contiguous United States and Canada,
Oceania, the Caribbean, and the Black Atlantic]{.underline}.
**[Ice]{.underline}** asks to be thought among many distinct reflections
regarding who, what, and why relations to land and water must be highly
specific, attuned, and carefully articu- lated. [In doing so,
I]{.underline} **[muddy imperial divisions of the planet that keep us
and our conceptualizations of waters and lands and ices apart, separate,

Bringing materiality and sociality together through the lens of ice,
I've placed analytics of water, ice, and land into proximity---
analytics often conceptually separated as though they have little to do
with one another. **[I worked across radical, emplaced traditions of
studies of Blackness and indigeneity, oceanic and landedness, climates
hot and cold]{.underline}**. I'm also interested in where these
productive touchings are more explicit. For instance, [Lorna Simpson has
placed such questions in her work over the last ten years on these
themes. Black & Ice was meant to be the name of Simpson's gallery
exhibit before she renamed the 2018 work Unanswer- able]{.underline}. 69
Simpson is best known as a conceptual photographer capturing images of
Black people and their hair and featuring Black American pol- itics.
[She photographed Rihanna for Essence magazine in the style of her Earth
& Sky and Riunite & Ice (2014--ongoing) series, which replaces Black
women's hair and their surroundings with painting and collaged tex- tual
cutouts of crystals, the cosmos, and other features of the natural
world, including ice]{.underline}.70 In Unanswerable, Simpson's work
takes multiple new forms in forty different pieces of painting, collage,
and sculpture (see plate 1). Unanswerable is unprecedented work for
Simpson, not only because of the use of diverse mediums and materials,
but also the over- whelming representations of ice in the large
canvases. Piercing blue ice- bergs and atmospheric clouds of white named
Ice 1, Ice 2, Ice 3, et cetera, abound across the series (see plates 2
and 3). [Ice is also present in the exhibit in Simpson's sculptures of
glass blocks that sit atop and at the edges of stacks of Ebony and Jet
magazines]{.underline}. The ice blocks distort the faces of the models
on the covers as well as in the large sculpture of a snowball with the
bust of a woman perched precariously atop it.

Unanswerable is the first of her work where ice emerges as a cen- tral
concept. She has said that the ice landscapes among structures of
stacked Black culture magazines are meant to evoke the challenging and
debilitating psychological effect of the ongoing political moment. On
Hauser & Wirth's installation website, Unanswerable is described as the
following:

[**For Simpson, ice has a significance since it recalls the expression
to be "on ice," or in prison, as well as Eldridge Cleaver's 1968 book
"Soul on Ice**," written while the renowned activist was incarcerated in
Fol- som State Prison]{.underline}. Prison is where one does time and is
an enforced form of isolation from wider society. And yet, Simpson
remarks, **["There's something about ice that has come into the work
that indi- cates either freezing or endurance. . . . Conceptually, this
is in tan- dem with what I'm experiencing emotionally but also what I
feel is going on politically: the idea of being relentlessly
consumed."]{.underline}** 71

Ebony and Jet magazines depicted Black American life in the 1960s and
1970s. The 2018 moment in which Simpson creates Unanswerable is made to
feel like an echo of the racism and misogyny animating those eras.
[Perhaps a frozenness of politics is represented by the ice blocks that
hold down Black culture magazines, freezing them in place for poten-
tial "relentless consumption." Or, perhaps the ice blocks are metaphors
for imprisonment that sit atop the magazines, pressing down into the
ephemera, freezing Black culture into stagnancy or stalling it from fur-
ther flourishing as it might without relentless American racism, taking
one form in the prison industrial complex]{.underline}. **[That
endurance is two- sided, as Simpson shows--- the violence carries on, as
does vibrancy and inno- vation. Ice melts but it also
endures.]{.underline}**

The severe landscapes, Simpson has said, are meant to show the absurdist
notion of daily life unfolding while there is an overwhelming presence
of a "teetering on an edge." 72 In an interview, Simpson responded to
inquiries about the meaning of the presence of glaciers and icebergs in
Unanswerable. Simpson responded, "'All these natural forces in peril at
the same time . . . to me it's not so much an environmental thing as
society, in particular America, being in peril in countless ways. It's
over- whelming, but not new. It's a return to a past. There's a lot
going on that's the same in terms of racism, bigotry, and the whole
shebang.' " 73 When asked directly about the potential correlation
between the figures of ice and the themes of melting and environmental
precarity in her work, [Simpson's pivot from an easy and neat answer
about a degraded environ- ment signals a keeping of power relations at
the fore. I interpret this as a turn away from making ice inherently
about the environment, natu- rally a metaphor for environmental decline
and devastation, and instead **reading ice as inherently about racism,
bigotry, and "the whole shebang." I appreciate Simpson's insistence that
ice has always been about race and power, not a metaphor for
power**]{.underline}. Simpson is asking for a reflection more complex
than grasping for a simple representation of a universal envi- ronment
changed by generalized human hands. Ice cannot give the easy answer. Ice
is unanswerable.

In a later show, from April to late July 2019, Simpson exhibited her
series called Darkening at the Hauser & Wirth gallery in New York City.
This exhibit, also featuring ice imagery, was inspired by a conversation
with and poem by Robin Coste Lewis titled "Using Black to Paint Light:
Walking through a Matisse Exhibit Thinking about the Arctic and Mat-
thew Henson." An excerpt from this poem was projected on a wall at the
gallery, framing the exhibit. It reads,

The unanticipated shock: so much believed to be white is ­ actually---
strikingly--- blue. Endless blueness. White is blue. An ocean wave
freezes in place. Blue. Whole glaciers, as large as Ohio, floating
masses of static water. All of them pale frosted azuls. It makes me
wonder--- yet again--- was there ever such a thing as whiteness? I am
beginning to grow suspicious. An open window.

I am blue.

I am a frozen blue ocean.

I am a wave stuck cold in midair.

The wave is nude beneath her blue dress.

Her skin is blue.74

Inspired by Lewis's stress on the color blue, Simpson's Darkening series
delivers an overwhelming palette of deep, deep, deep blues (see plates
4--6). [Blue washes over images of icebergs and Black women--- sometimes
their silhouettes, other times their eyes or other parts of their
faces]{.underline}. Craggy, ice- filled landforms appear at times
subtly, and in other pieces only in portions. The atmospheric dimensions
of the work are palpable with gray- blue clouds pluming in the dark
purple- blue landscape. Cut- outs of text from Ebony magazine again
punctuate many of the canvases by superimposition and screen print. A
tall stack of Ebony magazines installed within the gallery among the
canvases line the walls. [Through- out the Darkening series, slices of
vertical text and the eyes and faces of Black women peek through images
of dark blue icebergs]{.underline}. Aisha Sabatini Sloan reflects on
Simpson's ice series, writing, "Lorna Simpson has been painting
glaciers. Human- sized, cataclysmic. Eviscerated ice overlaid by a deep
blue wash. Tumbling ash, full spectrum of gray. Volcanic clouds. Nothing
whatsoever warm . . . these paintings gut. They are unfurling and torn
open. A wound before the blood comes." 75

[In Lewis's and Simpson's world(s) created in the exhibit, darkness
envelops in deep blues and purples nearly black. Lewis and Simpson both
bring **Matthew Henson** into their conceptual focus--- **an African
American explorer on board seven voyages to the North Pole.** In 1909,
Henson, along with four Inuit guides (Iggianguaq, Sigluk, Odaq, and
Ukkujaaq)76 as well as Robert Peary, are said to be the first individu-
als to reach the North Pole after eighteen years of attempts**. Lewis
and Simpson reread these moments for the experiences of a Black Arctic
that Henson may have had. Normative histories often omit Henson in favor
of Robert Peary, with Inuit interlocutors also erased.**]{.underline} It
wasn't until post- humously that Henson began to receive recognition.
Henson's autobiog- raphy details a narrative that includes descriptions
of the Arctic that are dissimilar from his counterparts.77 Sloan again
reflects on some of those writings: "Matthew Henson described his third
arctic winter as full of 'gorgeous bleakness, beautiful blackness.' The
only light came from the moon, which 'made a fairyland of the dark
valleys, glistening snow and deep, deep silence.' " 78 Ice and ice
geographies are not metaphorized by Simpson, Lewis, Henson, or Sloan as
overwhelming whiteness. **[As Inuk artist asinnajaq proclaims, "The
Arctic Is Not White." 79 The Arctic is not racially or metaphorically
white. The Arctic is Black, and the Arctic has already been and forever
will be Indigenous.]{.underline}**

In her introduction to "Granny Palettes: An Inuit Sense of Colour,"
Taqralik Partridge writes:

Blue and white are often the banner colours at any conference or trade
show about the North, but the Arctic is a place of many colours: the
saturated fuchsia of fireweed, the deep rusts and mus- tard yellows of
mossy bogs, the incredible turquoise of seawater around icebergs and the
vivid orange of suvak--- fish roe. The light alone changes so frequently
that winter snow may appear orange, pink, or green all in the same day.
Even during the weeks when the sun does not rise, starlight, moonlight,
and twilight move across the land.80

Ice is land.

Ice is not land.

Ice is water.

Ice is not water.

Ice is air.

Ice is not air.

Ice is empty.

Ice is not empty.

This chapter took up the concerns about colonial categorizations of the
world that keep histories, climates, and spaces of ice, water, and land
from meeting. I've tried to make room for productive touching and co-
theorizing among those concepts and analytics. In the next chapter, I
trace out other ways that ice has been made to speak. In those artic-
ulations, **[I worry about planetary stories of the ice core made
through ice core extraction, processing air bubbles, and scientific
research and conclusions that follow.]{.underline}** I carefully guess
about what ice as a materiality might experience in those moments. These
two chapters together demon- strate a method of guesswork and offer
invitations toward ice concerns beyond but not outside of violence and
in refusal of a study of ice where only white futurities can define and
make the planetary.

Ice geographies in a contemporary, normative sense are dominantly
imagined and circulate as landscapes of consequence only in their
declining transitory states as they pose potential problems to
geographies imagined as more meaningful.5 **[In its most present form,
ice animates the look and feel of rapid, urgent climate
change.]{.underline}** Across all versions of main- stream media, on tv
screens, news headlines, and internet memes, gla- ciers and ice sheets
collapse. Ice melt is mediated out to a mass audience. However, viewers
aren't always seeing the infrastructures of colonial- capitalism from
which that ice melt is a consequence. [It is true that today, ice is
melting faster than ever before]{.underline}. **[Melt causes social
upheaval among northern coastal communities, as well as those lives
shaped by sea level rise]{.underline}**. [Alaska's western coast was
pummeled by Typhoon Merbok in 2022, a storm bigger than has been seen in
decades and made worse by an unusu- ally warm Pacific Ocean, for
instance.]{.underline}

**[Ice melt disrupts long- standing practices of mobility by Indigenous
peoples across all ice geographies]{.underline}**. Communities are meant
to relocate due to rising seas without aid from governments invested in
capitalist extraction directly implicated in sea level rise. [Relations
with ice shift more quickly than ever remembered, which challenge
Indigenous fish- ing, harvesting, and hunting practices.]{.underline}
**[As of 2021, the Arctic is warming at a pace four times faster than
the rest of the planet]{.underline}**.6 **[Sea ice volume in the Arctic
has reduced by two- thirds since it was first measured in
1958]{.underline}**.7 One of Antarctica's ice shelves named "Doomsday
Glacier" parts away from itself and into the ocean. Simultaneously, an
inundation of climate models anticipates a sea level rise over the next
decade, half century, and century that will reshape the sociality of the
globe. [Readers, viewers, and listeners are told that melting ice will
continue to disrupt a more tem- perate world as sea levels rise in every
imaginable future because of and despite change in human
behavior]{.underline}. **[Simultaneously, activism and proactive
initiatives by Arctic Indigenous people(s) abound and multiply for
climate justice.]{.underline}**

**[Ice melt also creates and collides with other natural disasters
height- ened under the conditions of capitalist resource extraction and
accumu- lation, like floods, fires, and freeze.]{.underline}** [That
same ice melt in the far North creates new opportunities for the
expansion of profit, of shipping lanes, and the mobility of seemingly
ever- expanding resource extraction]{.underline}. Melt- ing icebergs are
transported by artists to well- trafficked city squares and conferences
that bring melt to a more temperate experience of every- day life. Ice
has become an unprecedented daily mediated experience of modernity
across the globe. [As a result, conditions of ice are now a key interest
for political, economic, academic, and activist
stakeholders.]{.underline} This unsettling potential of ice thus
spatially and temporally shapes the ways that contemporary humans
understand the past, respond to the present, and plan for the future.

Yet, ice has always been at the center of making sense of the world.
**[Ice as a de- peopled melting catastrophe, as a threat that will
unsettle the set- tled and the settlers, is a modern iteration of long-
standing ice anxieties, obsessions, and normative
orderings]{.underline}**. It has taken a considerable number of colonial
enactments for certain sets of humans to imagine the Arctic, and other
ice geographies, as empty and de- peopled. **[Especially as onto-
logically, cosmologically, and juridically, ice in part shapes and
figures the world for many Indigenous peoples who call the Arctic home
and home- land, and have for thousands of years.]{.underline}**8
Reflections on ice have also long been a constitutive element of Western
political thought and cultural imagination for hundreds of years.9 The
way that ice geographies are fig- ured in contemporary discourse are
just one piece of a longer story of ice relations and imaginings.

Ice is anything but an innocent, pristine entity or apolitical,
geograph- ical soothsayer. Historically, ice has been cast as blank,
barren, empty and/or ahistorical and disconnected from ongoing
socialities, human or otherwise.10 Often a description of emptiness
attends the desires of extraction in some form such as resource
extraction of crude oil or nat- ural gas. In many colonial cases,
landscapes must be made empty for white masculinity to be tested against
it or technological invention to be tested within it. Across landscapes
that are not immediately identifiable as easily workable for capitalist
enterprise such as those of ice, desert, or swamp, the articulated
"emptiness" of a landscape opens it for capi- talist improvement,
development, or other forms of extractive property relation. In the
Arctic, emptiness is articulated to identify it as exploit- able.11 The
practical response has been to evidence nonemptiness through a
demonstration of liveliness and fullness, as clear evidence of why not
to harm and exploit what was previously interpreted as empty--- to fill
the empty Arctic with life.12 It is not empty; it is vibrant, it is full
of his- tory, stories, relations, and peoples. These claims are correct,
and I pause at the impulse to fill some manufactured void with
information. Who am I trying to persuade, exactly, with whose relations,
and with what tools and methods of proof?

[I'd like to push a bit on the strategic necessity to argue for the
legible fullness of ice geographies, both ecologically and
socially.]{.underline} The response to imbue ice geographies with
vibrancy is also to try to imbue ice with more acceptable qualities for
those unfamiliar with those spaces. The urge is to fill ice geographies
with notions of normative life, to unmake or improve its "wasteland"
nature into something more recognizably aligned with normative or
capitalist value, something vibrant or even pure. **[I'd like to offer a
way to relate to ice and ice melt in a similar way to what M. Mur- phy
calls "chemical alterlife]{.underline}**." 13 [Alterlife questions the
normative senses of what life is and "asks for an unflinchingly
pessimistic acknowledgment that these chemical relations are racist,
harmful, even deadly, and that it is up to you to take on the ways that
you are caught up in the killing (even if they are killing you too, just
more softly)."]{.underline} 14 **[Each of us is impli- cated with ice
melt]{.underline}**. Though, like the metabolization of chemicals, there
is an unequal felt experience15 of that melt and, of course, the unequal
contribution of a capitalist- carbon "footprint" that makes melt in the
first place.16

**[In this alterlife, in which we are all caught up in the differently
expe- rienced melt, the generative capacity of emptiness can act as a
refram- ing]{.underline}**. I will not rush to narratively fill
emptiness, to beautify it toward progress. Erica Violet Lee writes, "A
wasteland is a place where, we are taught, there is nothing and no one
is salvageable. . . . Wastelands are spaces deemed unworthy of healing
because of the scale and amount of devastation that has occurred there.
**[Wastelands are named wastelands by the ones responsible for their
devastation."]{.underline}** 17 I add that wastelands are named
wastelands by the ones who have no relation, no history to lands deemed
empty, wasted, and/or destroyed. I'm unconvinced by the need to prove
otherwise, to fill emptiness.

#### The Archipelagic Americas should significantly increase its exploration of the Arctic by affirming [ice as analytic]{.underline}. 

#### Ice as analytic builds an archipelagic understanding of the world that bridges the connections between settler colonialism and enslavement -- that is necessary to combat territorial logics that manifest across the state and coalitional movements.

[Scholars writing about water and ocean as analytic, either explicitly
or inexplicitly, often upend the centrality of the European
continent.]{.underline} In recent iterations, the turn away from the
continental has also been a turn away from land and terrestrial as
center. In much of Indigenous law, water relations are central to the
functioning of community and not in ways that divide water from land.
Enactments of water dispossession and theft demonstrate its fundamental
nature similarly to land[. The pri- vatization of water rights,
pollution of clean drinking water sources and other forms of
environmental contamination, and the damming of riv- ers by colonial
infrastructure, as well as attendant actions such as water protection
that emerge as a result, illustrate the crucial role of water and access
to water]{.underline}.30 Not unlike how land is regulated through
settler law, water has been legislated as a necessity, particularly in
arid regions needed for agriculture, and through the uneven protection
of tribal water rights.

**[Water cannot be overdetermined by colonial bindings alone: the waters
that run through Indigenous lands are the arteries that feed and bind
humans and their kin]{.underline}**.31 As Melanie K. Yazzie and Cutcha
Risling Baldy write of water across Indigenous decolonization struggles,
"[Water is seen as an ancestor and as a relative with agency within this
network of life, one who deserves respect, care, and
protection."]{.underline} 32 These forms of rela- tion are common across
Indigenous communities and in the same breath take distinct, emplaced
forms. In Natalie Diaz's poem "The First Water Is the Body," she writes
of a particular historical and ongoing emplaced- ness with river:

The Colorado River is the most endangered river in the United States---
also, it is a part of my body. I carry a river. It is who I am: 'Aha
Makav. This is not a metaphor. . . . 'Aha Makav is the true name of our
people, given to us by our Cre- ator who loosed the river from the earth
and built it into our liv- ing bodies. Translated into English, 'Aha
Makav means the river runs through the middle of our body, the same way
it runs through the middle of our land. This is a poor translation, like
all translations. In American imaginations, the logic of this image will
lend itself to surrealism or magic realism--- Americans prefer a magical
red Indian, or a shaman, or a fake Indian in a red dress, over a real
Native. Even a real Native carrying the dangerous and heavy blues of a
river in her body. What threatens white people is often dismissed as
myth. I have never been true in America. America is my myth.33

In these stanzas, 'Aha Makav are inseparable entities simultaneously
land, water, and the human body, entwined and impossible to parse. Diaz
stresses that this is not metaphorical; she carries a river in her body,
and it is the first water. The water described by Diaz is not something
addi- tional to land, nor are the two mutually exclusive. Diaz insists
that even this nonmetaphorical reality will be rendered into an image,
simplified into something American imaginations prefer to interpret,
something saturated in magical realism. Native relationships to land and
water are often overdetermined by an outside gaze more interested in a
simulation of Indianness and not the reality of, for instance, 'Aha
Makav as it is lived and experienced under settler capitalism. In the
same way the translation into English can never fully encapsulate the
reality of the simultaneity of 'Aha Makav the- people- and- the- river,
the translation of Native water or land into the law will always be
insufficient and never fully realized--- it has never been true in
America.

**[Water as river, lake, or other waterbody is one central part of mate-
rial Native life, as is land. Ocean and island are key analytical modes
of thought in Pacific/Oceania studies as well as in Black diaspora
studies, especially of the Caribbean and the Black
Atlantic.]{.underline}**34 As Hi'ilei Hobart writes, "Across time
performance and literary works produced by Pacific Islander artists
recognize water as an agential being." 35 The ocean has provided an
epistemological arena for "the lives and writings of those for whom the
sea was simultaneously workplace, home, passage, peni- tentiary, and
promise." 36 Authors, poets, and scholars whose works con- stitute
conversations and knowledge production about water have long articulated
Indigenous and Black relationships to sea and ocean in ways that trouble
continental and over- terrestrial thinking. In this discussion of ocean
and watery analytics, the intention is not to marginalize land as less
crucial but to highlight that a range of theoretical lenses and oppor-
tunities buoy up in ways that may not occur if terrestrial- land is per-
manently at the fore. In so doing it is possible to not just bring
critical attention to water and its forms but also to push on the
neatness of the categories themselves that potentially operate to keep
experience and expertise separate from one another, and to also invite
ice to join in the chorus.

[Across Oceania and Black diaspora studies, ocean animates multiple
kinds of movement, mobility, theft, and offering.]{.underline}37 Such
work analyzes, imagines, and reimagines histories of ocean travel both
as cosmologically central and supremely violent through migrations both
forced and cho- sen. Across both orientations, ocean relationships are
writ as analytics of daily life, sociality, and origin for arrival in
place as well as a relation and connection to the rest of the world
through shared ocean waters. [Schol- ars of Blackness and the aftermaths
of slavery in their situated partic- ularities provide insight into what
the ocean might mean to that set of ongoing experiences]{.underline}.38
[As Tiffany Lethabo King writes, "The enduring metaphor and actual space
of the ocean has pulsed through Black dias- poric literature, criticism,
art, and theory.]{.underline} **[The Middle Passage and 'cross- ings' of
African- descended people in particular has animated and served as an
arterial through line in Anglo- African, Anglo- Caribbean, and Black
Canadian, as well as Hispanophone and Lusophone
traditions."]{.underline}** 39 **[The ocean and the sea animate analyses
and thought production around the Middle Passage, the slave ship, and
its multiplicity of afterlives.]{.underline}**

[Black thinkers make sense of that violent, enforced transit and the
rela- tionships to water before, after, and during.]{.underline}
[**Hortense Spillers** writes that "those African persons in the 'Middle
Passage' were literally suspended in the 'oceanic,' . . . removed from
the indigenous land and culture and not- yet 'American' either, these
captive persons, without names their captors would recognize were in
movement across the Atlantic, but they were also nowhere at all."
40]{.underline} [Her **orientation to the oceanic as a nowhere zone is
one where violent translations and transformations occurred--- from
Indigenous land made into captive persons.** **Christina Sharpe
formulates a similar position**]{.underline} [from settler- colonial
Canada and conceptualizes this aftermath as a form of watery
consciousness]{.underline} [**that she calls "the wake**." To be in the
wake is "to occupy and be occupied by the continuous and chang- ing
present of slavery's as yet unresolved unfolding" and to ascertain as to
whether, if anything, survives Black exclusion]{.underline}.41
[**Rinaldo Walcott writes** and expands upon the understanding of
Sharpe's wake- **consciousness through what he calls the "black
aquatic":**]{.underline} "[Blackness begins in the context of
liquidity--- the coffle and the slave ship are its founding. . .
.]{.underline} The aquatic and the saline, then, are not just metaphors
for Black people's emergence as a category of persons in the Americas
and beyond; **[the aquatic is a kind of foundational birth claim for
Blackness and thus Black diasporic peo- ple . . . if the sea has been
death, it has also been birth]{.underline}**." 42 **[Ocean, sea, and
water]{.underline}** are consequential beings both material and
imaginary. From that reframing of salt water as birth, others, too,
**[have theorized possible for- mulations of freedom in what Saidiya
Hartman has called the "afterlife of slavery]{.underline}**." 43 Just as
for Diaz and Aha'Makav, water and the sea for Wal- cott are not
metaphors; nor is the wake of slavery and dispossession that are felt as
ongoing institutions. The ocean continues to be both death and birth.
[Further, centering the nonhuman also means considering the water
itself--- as well as land and ice--- as categories and materialities
that push productively against the analytical power shored up by only-
human activ- ities on the terrestrial continent.]{.underline}

Caribbeanist Édouard Glissant wrote to simultaneously inculpate and
theorize in concert with and beyond the ongoing legacies of the Middle
Passage. **[Glissant offers]{.underline}** what he calls
**["archipelagic thought" to under- stand the world as an archipelago of
islands connected by the ocean.]{.underline}** Central to archipelagic
thinking are what he called "creolization" and "relation- identity,"
both of which move away from a root- based identity of territorialized
histories. In offering ocean as an analytic that binds across rather
than roots downward, [Glissant argues that a Deleuzian archipe- lagic-
rhizomatic- relational identity undoes the possibility of a center as
well as a continent]{.underline}.44 If roots can be made to align
colonial or national enactments of territorialization, the rhizome like
that of a strawberry plant reaches across rather than downward, in a
pattern that does not serve extraction or the metropole. [The
archipelago connects by the flows of ocean rather than by something that
is or must be soil.]{.underline} In taking seri- ously the Caribbean
emplacement and also inviting ice geographies into the conversation, the
archipelago of connection can bring hot and cold climates into dialogue
without the insistence of the normative root that necessitates pliable
land.

Glissant's contemporary **[Kamau Brathwaite in his concept of
"tidalectics" similarly understood the archipelago as
generative.]{.underline}** Tidalectics manifest in the movement of
water, as it touches land and is propelled backward and forward, moving
cyclically and diverging from a linear path. Brathwaite does not dismiss
roots and instead offers "subma- rine roots" as connective tissue across
and under the ocean as linkages. Brathwaite's imagining of the contours
of the ocean floor is connective, an underwater materiality both spatial
and geographical. As Kate Sik- losi puts it, "Brathwaite situates the
surface fragmentation of the Carib- bean island as a matter of scope and
perspective: from the surface of the ocean the islands appear separate,
yet underwater they form a network of connected submarine mountain
ranges." 45 [Both Glissant and Brathwaite demonstrate how the
geographies and movements of ocean in relation to island land shapes the
social- political]{.underline}. Brathwaite's work on the subma- rine
allows for a kind of underwater root not strictly botanical in nature,
or one that requires climatic specificity or fertile soil. This
submarine root is not totalized by territorialization. Archipelagic
thinking conceptual- izes islands as "part of a larger vastness \[that\]
contrasts colonial views of islands as isolated, small and insignificant
. . . \[as\] no island is an island because islands exist in dynamic
relationality to a larger archipelago and ocean." 46 **[If submarine
roots and mountain ranges and archipelagos can connect via ocean
currents and flows then this must also include oceans of ice and the
politics that exist within, alongside, and in relation. We cannot let
the climate and other land/water divisions of the world stall
coalitional thinking.]{.underline}**

**[For many Caribbean and Black diasporic thinkers, the sea holds histo-
ries of both lives lived before the transatlantic slave trade as well as
the experiences of violence enacted during the Middle
Passage]{.underline}**. In the after- lives of the bondage that waited
upon the many landed shores, the sea and ocean have been theorized
critically, distinctly, and yet in so many over- lapping formations.
[**Indigenous peoples of Oceania have their own modes of relating to
archipelago, island, and ocean**. Epeli Hau'ofa writes from Fiji against
dominant colonial perspectives that view the Pacific Islands as "too
small, too poor, and too isolated" to be of much consequence in his
persistence that "there is a world of difference between viewing the
Pacific as 'islands in a far sea' and as 'a sea of
islands.]{.underline}' The first emphasizes dry surfaces in a vast ocean
far from the centers of power. Focusing in this way stresses the
smallness and remoteness . . . the second is a more holistic perspective
in which things are seen in the totality of their rela- tionships." 47
In Hau'ofa's "sea of islands," he troubles the perspective that
overemphasizes the intellectual and economic centrality of a bounded,
landed continent. He undermines the colony- metropole paradigm that
wishes to see islands, their peoples, and the distinct ontological
order- ings that emerge from those geographies as impoverished. Hau'ofa
fur- ther asserts Oceania as a key term that understands islands, the
ocean, and the voyaging relationships among them as one critical
orientation to the world. [For Hau'ofa, only through imperialism has the
world of Ocea- nia been transformed into the Pacific Islands as they are
more commonly known today]{.underline}. [A militarized United States
utilized the idea of Oceania's islands as "remote" toward its advantage,
such as through nuclear test- ing throughout island communities of
Oceania, especially at Bikini Atoll, Enewetak Atoll, and Rongelap Atoll,
with fallout experienced throughout the Marshall Islands that continues
to be consequentially experienced.]{.underline}48 The militarized naval
regimes present in Oceania, however, are predated by the seafaring
practices of the peoples Indigenous to those geographies.

**[Bringing together the archipelagic thinking of the Caribbean and the
Pacific allows for fruitful conversations across those distinct
histories and power relations]{.underline}**.49 [**To center diverse and
distinct archipelagic think- ing is not to,** as Vicente Diaz puts it,
**"wash out difference and specificity," but is to**]{.underline}
["consider historical processes of cultural and social contact and
interconnectivity not simply by valorizing movement, but by critically
engaging the social and political processes of organizing space on and
by which movement takes place precisely to]{.underline} **[combat
exclusive categories of self and other and the bounded territoriality on
which they are affixed, as western and modern, whether colonial or
anticolonial, forms of nation- alism and sovereignty define and
constitute themselves."]{.underline}** 50 The archipe- lagic thinking
expounded upon here is interlinked with Diaz's ongoing work with canoe
voyaging and its revitalization across the Oceanic world. Seafaring
then, too, is not a metaphor but a set of material and spiritual
practices, sciences, and expertise held in conjunction with the ocean---
not simply a happening on its surface.

Similarly, Kanaka Maoli conceptualizations offer a worlding of water and
the volumetric that further blur a division of land and water. Can- dace
Fujikane writes that the relationships between elements, like land and
water, are defined by that which lies on their edges; borders are not
boundaries of separation but are seams of relationality: "Water moves
not just from the mountains to the sea but also laterally in often inex-
plicable ways. Clouds do not abide by man- made boundaries, traveling
across them to water the land. They also remind us that there are intri-
cacies in subterranean worlds that we cannot see and m'o'āina enable us
to think more expansively about the lateral relationality of ecosystems
and the far- reaching impacts of settler colonial overdevelopment, as
well as Kanaka Maoli movements for each." 51 As water takes a multitude
of states and interacts with land in various ways, water and land are
not portioned out into measurable units of transferable goods or one
element taking dominance over another. The watery and landed ecosystems
shape and co- constitute cosmological orderings. Water as analytic
transforms the landscape as it transmutes into different shapes, adding
dimension and contour not overdetermined by the analytic of land.
Furthermore, the touching of water in its multiple forms are not rigid
places of differ- ence and confusion, otherwise formulated as "contact
zones"; these are relational and rich ecosystems moving, shaping, and
contaminating one another.52

**[As ice melts into water increasingly under the conditions of capital-
ist accumulation, there is urgency to think ice and water more closely
together]{.underline}**. Kathy Jetñil- Kijner and Aka Niviâna offer one
example in their poetic exchange across the Marshall Islands and
Kalaallit Nunaat (Green- land). In their coauthored poem, they
illustrate the similar and distinct changes to their homelands--- one
polar, one tropical; one ice landscape melting, one island feeling the
water rise.

From these islands

we ask for solutions . . .

Let me bring my home to yours.

Let's watch as Miami, New York,

Shanghai, Amsterdam, London,

Rio de Janeiro, and Osaka

try to breathe underwater.

. . .

I give to you these rocks

as a reminder

that our lives matter more than their power.53

[Exchanging gifts and offerings from their respective homelands, these
two poets demonstrate how]{.underline} **[thinking across land/water/ice
put our shared futures into conversation and into potential co-
liberation.]{.underline}** **[They also hold the colossal violence of
ice melt, experienced differentially across communities, while
simultaneously refusing a totalizing catastrophe. Ice
binds]{.underline}** across space, both in its melting and in its frozen
state as it stabilizes a functioning climate. I am interested in
additional affinities that the coalitional thinking espoused in this
chapter allows for--- real- ities not consigned only to a scientific
ecological demise or stability but **[a crossing of radical traditions
that also bind us across geographies and histories.]{.underline}**

#### The role of the ballot is to engage in [careful guesswork.]{.underline} Careful guesswork resists the extraction of indigenous knowledge for settler gain. It is our duty to resist colonial knowledge wherever it shows up.

In emptiness, there is also what I offer as careful guessing or careful
guesswork[. Building from critical Indigenous studies, guesswork honors
emptiness, respecting the refusals, the breaks, the pauses, the doors
shut and not inspecting the windows]{.underline}. **[Careful guesswork
also urges a form of study that is not extractive, that is desire-
based,18 that does not seek to build new theories that displace
Indigenous theorizing.]{.underline}**19 Careful guessing is critically
attentive to the ongoing dimensions and histories of power relations
that shape the responses to the question at hand and the forms of
questioning that seem possible and impossible. Who and what shape my
questions that seem naturalized to me? [Careful guess- work upholds that
I can guess to the best of my knowledge, with account- ability to place
and peoples,20 and with an ethic of anti- coloniality and decoloniality
when possible]{.underline}.21 **[Careful guesswork insists that
objectivity is an impossibility, that researchers are narrators who
craft compromised stories]{.underline}**. We are guessing always, and
our guesses must work to be con- sensual among all forms of our
interlocutors, relations, and the careful guessing that has emerged
before us.22

[In my own guesswork, I am studying, researching, and guessing about
Indigenous ice geographies, the spatial materiality of ice, and the
experi- ences that ice might be having]{.underline}. I cannot know with
the normative perfor- mance of certainty that is expected of a
researcher. I can read, listen, and participate thoroughly, widely,
experientially and make careful guesses. [The work of careful guessing
in relation to nonhuman kin, entities, and collaborators is not to
anthropomorphize.]{.underline} [Guesswork upholds that ice geographies
cannot and will not be enclosed by the stretches of human
intellectualizing or imagination.]{.underline} Instead, I can try to the
best of my care- ful, critical abilities to tell my compromised
reflections of the interlock- ing politics, stories, histories, and
affective embodiments of and with ice geographies that existed before I
had ideas about them. **[As Saidiya Hartman writes of her concept
critical fabulation, there is a political-ethical- moral container we
make as our research protocols. It is our responsibility to write within
and against the intellectual infrastructures that invent the limits of
what and who counts and matters.]{.underline}**23 [In care ful
guesswork, emptiness is a political reality of the haunting of colonial
theft,24 a choice or a refusal,25 and the material embodiment of space
and the infrastructure of matter to contain emptiness.]{.underline}
Emptiness does not equate to meaninglessness or a void to be filled with
meaning. For even if this mischaracterization were true, that ice
geographies are empty, would they be less worthy of my time, attention,
and care?

Toward that sensibility, **[I'm not concerned with redeeming ice as
mean- ingful]{.underline}**. Nor do I uphold a social vibrancy of ice,
demonstrate a value of eco- logical vitality, or unmake it as a
wasteland. From where I sit, **[ice is not in need of redemption or
valorization]{.underline}**; it has always been and will continue to be
consequential in multitudinous ways and especially to Indigenous
peoples. **[I am also interested in how ice geographies and the
materiality of ice have been deployed to serve colonial enterprises of
anti- Indigeneity.]{.underline}** My curiosity in materiality is not to
deemphasize affect or to uphold a positivistic analysis that
necessitates material evidence as the arbiter of Truth. I show that the
research- need for material evidence necessitates violence against
Indigenous peoples, their ancestors, and their cultural items.
Oftentimes the materiality of ice and other matter are made into
evidence to prove violent theses.

If ice isn't empty and but is also generatively empty, then it has also
been a site for normative machinations of masculinity and can also over-
ride those determinations. Imperial science at the poles is nearly
always entangled with identity- making projects of white nationalism,
resource- based commerce, and masculinity.26 Lisa Bloom's ever- relevant
text Gen- der on Ice: American Ideologies of Polar Expeditions reminds
readers that "polar expeditions were icons of the whole enterprise of
colonialism" and that "the difficulty of life in desolate and freezing
regions provided the ideal mythic site where men could show themselves
as heroes capable of superhuman feats." 27 The impulse to test and
evidence masculine mettle against the elements is ongoing. In a sense,
the figure of the hero never dies.28

[This book takes up ice and race. I illustrate that]{.underline}
**[spaces of ice were wea- ponized by Enlightenment philosophers through
concepts of environ- mental determinism to racialize and dispossess
Indigenous peoples of the Arctic]{.underline}**. [Within these notions,
"extreme" environments of the North supposedly rendered Indigenous
peoples intellectually and corporeally inferior, particularly in
distinction to white men inhabiting temperate zones from whom and from
where these theories emerged.]{.underline} Environmen- tal determinism
of the "frigid" and "torrid" zones is linked in the simul taneous and
similar racialization of Indigenous peoples in tropical and icy
geographies. Enlightenment philosophers and ancient geographers defined
tropicality through a racialization that characterized peoples of the
mid- latitudes as "naturalized" laborers and in other space- times into
property,29 whereas iciness was wielded to dispossess Indigenous peoples
of juridical claims to Indigenous rights and territory.30 In ice
geographies, racial histories of ice figure into the ways that
Indigenous peoples were forced to navigate juridical realms of land
meanings and land dispossession.

**[Ice geographies, as they are brought under an imperial scientific
lab- oratorial gaze and racializing regime, are bound up with colonial
enact- ments over land, territory, and the peoples who live in concert
with those lands and territories]{.underline}**.31 [Nineteenth- century
polar expeditions were com- pared alongside expeditions to what was
called "darkest Africa." 32]{.underline} **[The gendered and colonial
ideations of conquering the "blank, white space" on the map of the
Arctic and Antarctica are also always racialized, anti- Indigenous, and
anti- Black projects as well.]{.underline}** In Alaska the naming of the
territory "darkest Alaska" fit easily in American imaginings of a wider
imperial geography. The central position of Africa as the "Dark Conti-
nent" in colonial and imperial activities during the time period
provided a kind of common grammar.33 This book aims to keep the local
contexts of colonialism and imperialism central while not losing sight
of the entan- glements of global projects of white supremacy always at
work. In Cooling the Tropics, for instance, Hi'ilei Hobart analyzes the
global movements of ice as a comestible and as a refreshment.34 Hobart
clarifies how ice fol- lowed the ruts of empire and carved new routes of
dispossession. In this case, ice as a foodstuff can be made mobile and
in tropical environments act as a "cooling" metonym for civilization.

#### **A Kritik-focus model of debate challenges [historical erasure]{.underline} and provides a predictable approach to the topic through a [Radical Stasis Point.]{.underline}**

4\. MODEL OF DEBATE To create a blueprint, the Kritik-Focus Model must
have a purpose. [Proponents of **Kritik debate** argue that it **creates
opportunity for epistemological growth** that students do not experience
elsewhere **because they are incentivized by ballots to** research a
wide variety of arguments that challenge **their understanding of the
world**]{.underline} \*1. This is consistent with Roger Solt's (1995, p.
A9-10) claim that [decisions in]{.underline} any [debates represent
provisional judgements that produce, "our moral and political belief
system\[s\]".]{.underline} [At the end of a season or a career, each
person is fundamentally transformed by the conversations they have been
a part of.]{.underline} Alternatively, **[defenders of the PFM
argue]{.underline}** that competitive equity and **[a fair decision is
the only thing each round should represent]{.underline}**. However, the
**[competition for its own sake is unacceptable in an educational
activity]{.underline}**. [Tiffany Dillard-Knox, Director of The
University of Louisville Malcolm X Debate Society and former participant
in "The Louisville Project"]{.underline} \*2 [warns us against such a
mode of competition:]{.underline} "Competition at all costs is
dangerous\...Our argument was that people wanted to win and would do
anything to win regardless of the dehumanizing effects of particular
strategies\... like the Malthus argument\...it was all about winning\...
Competition at all costs creates harmful effects because we're not
thinking about the people we are debating against\..." **[Prior to
Kritik debaters pushing back on competition at all costs, judges would
allow students to make racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory
arguments because, as Director Dillard-Knox explains," \... literally
anything went".]{.underline}** Today, judges are willing to penalize
debaters for creating a hostile environment because competition is no
longer our sole priority. To avoid this pitfall, **[KFM will prioritize
that the educational environment and the growth of students over any
marginal benefits of improved competition.]{.underline}** [The
Kritik-Focus Model starts with the Affirmative team**. It is their
burden to choose a critical/cultural perspective**]{.underline} [based,
at least partially, on academic research **and apply it to the
Resolution**. Perspectives run the gamut from Critical Race Theory,
Womanism, \[Latine\], and Marxist perspectives to broader theories of
Ontology, Epistemology, and Cosmology]{.underline}. From their
critical/cultural understanding of the Resolution, **[the Affirmative
must advocate a Method of change that departs from the status
quo]{.underline}**. [**The Negative team has the burden of
rejoinder---**they must prove that the Affirmative Method is not
desirable]{.underline}. To prove that the Affirmative is not desirable,
[the Negative must choose a critical/cultural perspective, evaluate the
Affirmative, and respond]{.underline}. **[After a year of Kritikal
debates on the Resolution, a single student would have been exposed to
dozens of critical perspectives and would have a deep understanding of
forgotten or sublimated histories that they do not learn anywhere
else.]{.underline}** By the end of a debate career, competitors would be
incentivized to be proficient and well-read across all parts of the
academy. **[The NDT champion, CEDA, or TOC champion would represent the
team with the best ability to evaluate, apply, and articulate
critical/cultural theories and methods to global
problems.]{.underline}** KFM Affirmative Methods must make a good faith
effort to be tied to the topic. Opponents of this argue that this allows
the Affirmative to choose an advocacy outside of the topic. I, however,
am arguing that we re-think what it means to debate the Resolution.
**[Those who compete under the KFM understand debatable arguments to be
limited by something I call the Travel Test.]{.underline}** When teams
are traveling to competitions and someone inquires about the topic,
well-worn travelers know not to rattle off the entire Resolution.
Instead, **[we provide the key words that describe the larger topic
being debated]{.underline}**. **[This year's CPD topic is Military
Alliances. No proponent of KFM would be surprised to hear an Affirmative
that reduces a commitment to the system of Militarism itself. This is a
predictable, controversial premise for a Kritikal argument linked to the
core of the topic.]{.underline}** PFM advocates object to shifting from
"The" Resolution controversy to "A" topic controversy even though they
may acknowledge that many Kritikal Methods are controversial. **[William
Repko]{.underline}**, [Director of Debate at Michigan State University
**explained** his take on this issue: **"There are debates in
critical/cultural theory that don't center on the state but that have a
lot of clash**]{.underline}. At times I do see non-traditional teams run
an Aff that is dipped right from the heart of a fight that's
academically occurring in critical/cultural theory. To me, **[there
would be no excuse for a Negative team to stand up and be like
'Topicality' because there are arguments to be had there]{.underline}**.
[And students would learn and grow if the community could agree on a
critical/cultural theory \[Resolution\]"]{.underline} While Director
Repko and I agreed on many issues and solutions for problems facing the
debate community, the conditional embrace of the benefits of the KFM was
not one of them. One of the very reasons **[Kritikal Affirmatives are
valuable]{.underline}** is because **[they speak truth to
power]{.underline}** to resist those inequitable arrangements. [The
voting blocs among powerful traditional schools]{.underline}, which run
along the racial lines of the Clash of Civilizations, [means that the
controversies that appeal to KFM teams will not be chosen]{.underline}.
**[This imbalance in institutional power is what inspired the broad
readings of the topic by teams like Louisville, Towson, and
Emporia.]{.underline}** Much like number runners, **[the informal
consensus among KFM teams about what controversies matter is a means for
those without power to claim it by "hacking" the game]{.underline}**.
**[The fact that championship winning Kritik teams]{.underline}** and
coaches **[are able to]{.underline}** identify, **[predict, and
prepare]{.underline}** for all of the "unpredictable" and "undebatable"
Kritikal Affirmatives **[means that there is some stable point of
departure]{.underline}**. Rather than understanding the Resolution in a
vacuum, Kritik teams boldly acknowledge that the Resolution is
contextualized by recent ground-breaking rounds, the larger history of
debate, and academic debates taking place when "The" controversy is
considered ripe. The confluence of these factors, and the value that
teams find in these debates, is what allows **[KFM teams]{.underline}**
to **[attune themselves to]{.underline}** what I think of as **[a
Radical Stasis Point and the mechanics of this model.]{.underline}**
Director Repko also finds that engaging the Kritik does require more
from coaches and students. We talked briefly about his team's shift in
preparation after Georgetown AM won the 2012 NDT on the Complexity
Kritik. He notes that," \... \[A\] lot of my time I spent pouring my
familiarity into the heads of our students. There's a learning
curve\..." As someone who has been consistently been direct about his
hesitance to fully embrace the KFM, I do take his concerns about time
and competition shaping incentives seriously. There are some
Affirmatives where one of the "gears", as he calls it, is to not defend
a, "perspective from the literature but to defend an opinion of the
affirmative". There is a risk that some Affirmative teams would escape
to the margins of the topic to avoid a debate. These teams, however, are
engaging the Negative in bad faith and would not be utilizing the KFM
since they are not defending a Resolution-based change to the status quo
that resolves a significant harm. The KFM does not attempt to duplicate
the same level of policy precision that advocates of the PFM claim to.
[However, KFM does not dismiss the need for policy details to be germane
to the Method of the Affirmative]{.underline}. I spoke to Robel Worku, a
labor organizer in Denver, Colorado, about the role that details play in
social justice. As a former qualifier to the Tournament of Champions and
the NDT, he spent his time in debate engaging the PFM. He shared with me
that "\... policy details are important" specifically when speaking with
legislators. Moreover, dismissing details," in the project of organizing
and building power "lets people with power set the terms of discussion
which," leaves power at the table." However, [Robel does remember
debating and watching Kritik teams such as West Georgia DF that would
always articulate their arguments (Afropessimism, Critical Race Theory,
Red Pedagogy) in the context of policy.]{.underline} Understanding the
role that mechanisms play in ensuring enforcement or amending agreements
is important and can be a valuable part of Kritik debates. However, he
does not think that the focus on semantics in Topicality/Framework (TFW)
debates is helpful in increasing understanding of those details.
Srinidhi Mupalla, a software engineer, wanted debaters to temper their
instinct to argue that maximizing details via an exclusive use of PFM is
in anyone's best interest. In high school Srinidhi qualified to the TOC
as a PFM debater in the D.C. area and went on to create one of the most
successful flex teams as one half of Berkeley MS \*3. He compared the
details that you learn in Policy Debate to those works of literature: "I
read that when you read a book or a novel, generally, over time you
don't really remember the details, but you remember the shift in
perspective or thinking. \...\[E\]ventually you'll forget all the little
factoids learned and all you'll have is the singular perspective that
you got from that. But if you do different kinds of debate you learn all
the different perspectives\... I don't really remember the details of
\[Ballistic Missile Defense\] anymore\... That stuff is useful, but
you'll get that anyway. You don't need 8 or 9 years of that\..." As our
conversation continued, Srinidhi explained that **[there are diminishing
returns when exclusively engaging in PFM.]{.underline}** Unless a team
was "exploring across the academy" he did not feel like they would be
able to produce nearly a decade of "meaningful education". His college
debate partner Violet Spurlock, a former TOC champion and non-profit
researcher, referred to their Marijuana Affirmative on the Legalization
topic in 2014 that focused on building rhetorical strategies to,"\...
shift the \[legalization\] movement towards decarceration and
anti-racist ends \...". She argued that it allowed them to learn about
legalization policy from the perspective of activists, policymakers, and
special interest groups while understanding how discourse around policy
shapes implementation. 5. BEING NEGATIVE This paper has already
established that **[there are]{.underline}** often **[debatable
controversies]{.underline}** in the literature **[that give the Negative
ground.]{.underline}** **[By re-thinking what it means to evaluate the
Resolution from a Radical Stasis Point and by reading across the
academy, Negative teams can win within the KFM.]{.underline}** [There
are countless Kritikal First-Round teams that prove that this is
possible]{.underline}. TFW should be an option of last resort under the
KFM (unless you are debating an undisclosed Affirmative) because it is
overwhelmingly used to disengage from the content of the Affirmative
(Odekirk & Reid- Brinkley, 2012). **[There are three types of Kritik
arguments that always engage the Affirmative--- Case Turns,
Counter-Methods, and Ethics Argument.]{.underline}** [Each of these
operate similarly to PFM Disadvantages, Counterplans, and Structural
Kritiks, respectively]{.underline}. Where teams generally falter is
thinking through link the arguments that indict the Affirmative Method.
Violet explained, as an incredibly flexible and successful 2N, that you
need to first broaden your idea of what a link argument is. At first,
she struggled with identifying places to clash with Kritik Affirmatives
but realized that there are different "levels" of links that you can
think through. Violet suggests that teams**[, "Think about the rhetoric
of \[the 1AC\]. What kinds of language, metaphors, constructions of
identity, value, and community are being invoked in this
argument?]{.underline}** How can we talk about the way that those
rhetorical constructions shape the actual performance of the advocacy?"
Moreover, Violet believes the easiest way to beat a Kritikal Affirmative
is to respond to the 2AR, not the 1AC. By scouting other teams,
historicizing the concepts and terms they use, and finding academic
support for your links arguments she says you can find a specific
strategy for every Affirmative. Alternatively, **[there is nothing wrong
with a generic strategy in either a PFM or KFM]{.underline}**. [PFM
teams generally argue that the Negative ground in Kritik debates is
bland and unappealing.]{.underline} [This claim would be more persuasive
if there were not as many versions of the Antiblackness Kritik to learn,
outside of any other argument, as there were viable Politics scenarios
during the 2019- 2020 debate season]{.underline}. The challenge of the
Kritik is finding literature that interests you and establishing
conversations between that scholarship and the other team's. Dr. Sean
Kennedy of Kansas KQ, one of most winningest and flexible teams of the
decade, shared some of his thoughts about approaching the role of the
Negative. As someone who coached multiple First-Rounds, Copeland
Panelists, and top speakers under both the PFM and KFM his thoughts here
are uniquely valuable for thinking through debate pedagogy. The first
time he remembered debating a Kritkal Affirmative that was completely
outside of his sphere of training, he was Negative against the 3- Tier
Process Method \*4. Before the round his coach, a Kansas debater, told
him to try his best to engage, to be open-minded, and to move on the
fly. When the Affirmative asked him to use certain types of evidence or
styles of argument he did. From that one debate he learned a lesson
about being Negative. He said from then on, "\...\[m\]y thing was always
just if the other team is doing this thing that is a little different
from whatever the norm is just try and roll with it". In the early
2000's this approach was rare; most coaches and judges were trying to
suppress the spread of the Kritik. Moreover, Dr. Kennedy could not
recall a time when a coach or lab leader at summer workshop told him
that he could not engage Kritikal Affirmatives. By the time he was in
college he thought of himself as just a debater, not wed to either side
of the culture wars, engaging other people on the merits of their
arguments. As a coach he taught his Kritikal students to **[manage the
workload of Kritik debate by breaking possible affirmative cases up into
"genres", preparing for those areas broadly, and continuing to get more
specific as you progress.]{.underline}** **[Debating "genres" of
arguments under the KFM is hard because it is uncomfortable to rethink
cultural assumptions]{.underline}**. Srinidhi, with distance from his
years as a competitor, realized that, "[Kritik debate requires one more
element of critical thinking. You have to think about the thing you're
reading, yourself in relation to it, and yourself in relation to the
other people that you're debating \...It asks more in evaluating
something previously unknown \..."]{.underline} However, **[this is a
feature of KFM, not a bug. To achieve the goal of epistemological
growth, students must struggle with tough ethical and theoretical
questions.]{.underline}**

rule and even used as a site of plunder---as seen with neoliberal

Dutertismo does not break with the liberalism of past presidents.
Duterte's populism is resulted in insincere promises and is all talk.
The electoral wing of National Democracy, the Makabayan bloc, shamefully
allied with Duterte back in 2015 and early 2016. Duterte was then an
infamous and controversial figure who was an outspoken murderer of the
urban poor in his home Davao City. The Makabayan bloc allying with an
outspoken murderer shows how congressional progressives betray their
principles in favor of opportunism in the arena of reform---indeed an
opportunism that resulted in almost no gains. [The left-wing policies
promised by Duterte such as peace with CPP-NPA-NDF insurgency and an end
to contractualization have both collapsed into nothing---false promises
by Duterte used as a means of capturing power.]{.underline}

**[The non-National Democratic electoral socialists and social democrats
are as equally guilty of opportunism.]{.underline}** [We have witnessed
how the social democratic Akbayan party-list practically attached
themselves as the left-wing of the Liberal Party during the regime of
President Noynoy Aquino, the predecessor of Duterte.]{.underline}

**[Congressional politics is fundamentally a politics that removes
agency from the people---it disempowers them by design]{.underline}**.
There is a hierarchy between the representative with power and the
supposed constituent below them**[. Voting for a candidate every few
years is not power, it is a mere image of power---indeed a
spectacle.]{.underline}** [The voter is merely a passive spectator in
the congressional process mediated by parties and
representatives.]{.underline} [Voting a politician out of office is not
control over that politician when during their four- or six-year term
they cannot be recalled.\[]{.underline}8\] After winning, the
representative do not even have to listen to the concerns of their
voters. Meanwhile, the voters who did not vote for them are simply not
represented at all! [Voting does not empower the people; the most voting
can do is prevent gains won in previous skirmishes of class struggle
from being rolled back.]{.underline} **[Indeed any gains of the class
struggle in congressional politics are ultimately fragile gains, with
the ever-present possibility of reaction from oligarchs and capitalists
rolling back gains]{.underline}**. Congressional politics and reformism
ultimately renders voters and constituents as objects of the power plays
of mediators and representatives. **[Voters and constituents---who can
only spectate in these power plays of statecraft---are not full subjects
in their politics and are forced into a passive and mediated
role.]{.underline}**

**[We think resources spent on building votes ought be spent on building
a politics based on popular power instead.]{.underline}** Building
agency among the disempowered is more important than providing them a
mere image of agency. Politics is too important to be left to electoral
politicians.

[Reforms are the end-goal of reformism; in contrast, we anarchists seek
social revolution.]{.underline} Reformism and electoral politics risk
transforming social movements into defenders of capitalism and the
welfare state in order to defend the gains won through representatives.
**[We are against reformism because we are for a revolutionary politics
that seeks a break with the state and capital.]{.underline}** That does
not mean we are against reforms. On the contrary, we think the best way
to win reforms is through building social movements based on popular
power and an unmediated politics where people become full subjects in
their politics. These social movements would use direct action to force
concessions and reforms from the state and similarly defend those
reforms through direct action as well. **[Reforms won through militant
action are more durable than those won through representatives
alone.]{.underline}** "Power concedes nothing without a demand," as
Frederick Douglass said.\[9\] By using direct action instead of relying
on representatives, a social movement builds the conditions of a
revolutionary politics when in time they can challenge the state and
capital.

[Building popular power is not easy---indeed it is more difficult than
canvassing votes---but]{.underline} **[if we want to build a liberatory
politics that could develop and defend real gains against reaction and
oligarchic plunderers, organizing a liberatory politics outside and

#### Epistemological interrogations of archipelagic thinking are necessary to break from anti-black epistemic silencing.

An Embrace of the Principle of Open Epistemologies: Concluding Thoughts

In this review of Black-Archipelago anticolonial thinking I have
positioned authors of its canon as subjects who speak psychological
theory. [I have done so despite the fact that within the western
psychology canon]{.underline} [**Black-Archipelago subjects have been
summarily excluded from contributing to the global knowledge order** of
psychological science]{.underline}. The idea that people of the
Black-Archipelago speak reflects empirical reality. Yet, impediments
exist to Black-Archipelago anticolonial knowledge from entering into the
global knowledge order.

In the seminal postcolonial essay titled Can the Subaltern Speak?,
published in 1968 by the Indian literary theorist and feminist critic
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, she addresses the experience of **[people
produced as subaltern]{.underline}** [(vs. western)]{.underline} who
[**are declared ahistorical and mute**. Not because this is an empirical
truth, but **because of the power of western epistemology to define,
deselect and therefore exclude women12 from membership in the category
of those who speak.**]{.underline}

I raise Spivak's (1988) theory on conditions of speakability here
because the loss of being heard to speak, while doing so, is a
structural condition of alienation experienced by subaltern people in
Euromodernity. It is used to undermine the non-western human's sense of
self as a knower and speaker of knowledge that emerges from geographies
beyond western reason.

This essay argues for **[liberation from Euromodern forms of alienation
and epistemic silencing.]{.underline}** **[It promotes an embrace of the
principle and praxis of open epistemologies within globalised canons of
thought.]{.underline}** Given the history of Euromodern epistemic
silencing and knowledge we now have about its consequences, it is up to
adherents of western psychological science---the people who stand guard
at the gate of the canon of imperious psychological theory---to begin
the process of evaluating their relationship to psychological knowledge
derived from geographies cum epistemologies beyond the West. As this
paper reasons, opening the epistemically racist, sexist, and gendered
universalised psychology canon to thought that has been subalternised is
a problem to be solved by western psychologists who hold the keys to
unlock access to the globalised psychology canon.

[**Ways to open the gates of knowledge** toward thought that has
interrogated our shared history from the point of view of the human
**are available, should agents**]{.underline} [of western psychological
science]{.underline} **[wish to participate in a truly global psychology
epistemology project]{.underline}**. In the meantime, the
Black-Archipelago anticolonial canon is available for those who wish to
study psychological phenomena in Euromodernity from the point of view of
the human.

Island studies as a decolonial project

Walter Mignolo (2011), a central figure in debates on coloniality around
the world, discusses the development of thinking within the frame of the
'decolonial option'. He emphasizes that [**decolonial work involves**
getting entangled in the complex web of contemporary political and
cultural studies and competing with **divergent epistemologies** and
conceptions of creation and sensory experience.]{.underline} Mignolo
asserts that indigenous practices can play a central role in how we deal
with the colonial wound, through decolonial healing. Decoloniality
connects numerous projects around the world.

While indigenous decolonial projects are certainly among them, **[island
studies is itself an important decolonial venture]{.underline}**.
[**This is a timely project because,** within the discussions of the
effects of colonization]{.underline}, [**much work remains to be done to
disentangle the difference between colonization and coloniality and to
determine how (and where) colonized peoples might find themselves in a
decolonized world.** Island studies offers an opportunity to deepen this
discourse.]{.underline} [**More critically, this work is required at a
deeper ontological and epistemological level**. This special thematic
section represents a step in the direction of island studies as a
decolonial project and]{.underline} **[a vital contribution to
understanding how decolonization might be understood and, as a result,
recognizing the myriad ways of breaking with the colonial trappings
still present in the 21st Century.]{.underline}**

With small populations and limited habitable land areas, decolonization
influences island communities in special ways. It is perhaps on islands
that confrontations and coparticipations inherent in decolonization
processes are having the greatest impact in our age of digital
communication, rapid transport, and (significantly) globalized
indigeneity and anticolonial activism (Davis, 2016).

Many small islands were thrust into a postcolonial political reality
without a precolonial political tradition upon which to draw, either
because colonialism had comprehensively altered the composition of the
island's population or introduced a population to hitherto-uninhabited
islands (Barbados, Falkland, Mauritius, Singapore, etc.) or because
decolonization sought to form a modern nation-state out of distinct, and
often widely dispersed, cultures and ethnicities (Cyprus, Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands, etc.). Some island societies (Greenland, Guam,
Hawai´i, Macau, Mayotte, Montserrat, Orchid Island, Saint-Martin/ Sint
Maarten, Tokelau, etc.) also maintain dependent relationships with
larger states (not always their former colonial powers) and survive as
subnational island jurisdictions.

**[Decolonization is not an event but a process.]{.underline}**
Colonialism introduced global economics, politics and culture to many
island societies. [Even after the colonial power has withdrawn or been
expelled, the window to the world persists]{.underline}. The peoples
left behind often face limitations to sovereignty, human resources and
economic capacity that exacerbate the challenges associated with island
societies in general. The experience of colonial administration can
provide a model for postcolonial government and development, yet the
reproduction of metropolitan political systems and maintenance of
colonial administrative apparatuses can also conceal deeply problematic
governance practices (Baker, 1992; Grydehøj, 2016b; Veenendaal, 2015).
Meanwhile, although the causality is uncertain (Bertram, 2015),
experience of colonialism and persisting non-sovereignty may be
correlated with political and economic success, with quantitative
measures of social and economic wellbeing consistently showing
autonomous non-sovereign island territories outperforming small island
states (Armstrong & Read, 2000; Bertram, 2004; McElroy & Pearce, 2006).

Conclusion

In this article, we have questioned how an academic might decolonize
themselves in the context of structural and systemic problems driving
internationalization and decolonization strategies within HE. By
adopting Collaborative Analytics, and employing an autoethnographic
approach to data capture, we have cooperatively shared our intersecting
ideas and perspectives. The three iterations of share data, share
results, share decisions have helped us investigate the many facets of
decolonization of the academic -- itself, a Western perspective.
[Pursuit of knowledge can be deeply embedded in colonial practices and
consequences, yet there is a need for heightened reflexivity, and
self-scrutiny in better realizing our decolonial quest as European
academics.]{.underline} We recognize how the act of writing for a
Western journal is immersed in the Western academy. We appreciate that
**[academic writing involves selecting, arranging and presenting
knowledge, privileging text, and considering carefully what issues count
as significant.]{.underline}** If engaged in uncritically, we could be
guilty of rendering indigenous writers invisible or unimportant, while
reinforcing the validity of our voices in this article. As Smith (2012,
p. 37), asserts: 'writing ... is never innocent'**[. We therefore write
with 'epistemological vigilance' (Santos, 2007, p. 79).]{.underline}**

There are grounds to consider that **[decolonization and IoC have
similarities.]{.underline}** Hidden curricula, which have long been a
component of the discourse on internationalization of curricula, seem
equally relevant in the debate on decolonization. Implementation
processes for internationalization and decolonization may also run along
similar lines. Yet, even with dedicated university policies, strategies
and support, **[meaningful decolonization ultimately depends on radical
investment and focused operationalization initiatives for curriculum
transformation to occur]{.underline}**. [Nonetheless, we also argue that
individual responsibility and commitment is required, and at all levels,
to engage critically with knowledge to offer a renewed understanding of
history, culture and language, in a process of 'forever
becoming'.]{.underline}

V Transoceanic Storytelling:

Awakening Literacies of Saltwater Co-Belonging and Responsibility This
intervention is an experiment in transoceanic storytelling that calls
for saltwater belongings and responsibilities amid the brutality of
racial, colonial, and capitalist logics in the many "souths of the
world" (Walter and Walter 2018, 15). [Our polyphonic]{.underline}
**[storytelling]{.underline}** [that **listens to oceanic
spaces**]{.underline} [does not refuse white knowledges with colonial
legacies en bloc but tries to]{.underline} **[open up a space that would
welcome a chorus of human and more-than-human voices]{.underline}**.
These stories of the ocean churn and soak our thinking, so we can begin
to dream about how things might be otherwise, as a first-generation
ethnicminority migrant of color and a Māori Indigenous woman living in
white settler colonial societies. There are absent bodies and spaces in
our exploration of ocean ontologies because we relied on literature
published in English as well as academic journals and reports
electronically available, rather than gray and multilingual literature.
Loch and Riechers (2021), in their review of literature on environmental
change in coastal ecosystems in the Global South, regret that
**[Indigenous and Local Knowledge is in danger of being lost unless
research paradigms and methodologies are broadened,]{.underline}** [and
the power dynamics of hierarchical governance is unsettled.]{.underline}
Indigenous-led research by Locke, Trudgett and Page (2021) use the
metaphor of the oyster to describe Indigenous knowledges as a grain of
sand that agitates the shell of Western knowledge, but when these
knowledges interact across difference in a shared space, beautiful
pearls of knowledge begin to form.

**[As geographers, it is necessary to awaken inclusive memories,
imaginaries, and philosophies that nourish pearls of knowledge and
breathing oceans]{.underline}**. [Listening to Aboriginal scholar
Yunkaporta (2019), who engages in sand-talk yarning, maybe we need a
kinshipmind, a story-mind, a dreaming-mind, an ancestor-mind, and a
pattern-mind to produce new saltwater literacies of belonging and
responsibility.]{.underline} But how do we answer Mathur and da Cunha's
(2020, 192) when they use the Sanskrit word Sindhu or "ocean of rain"
and ask: ["Wetness is everywhere. Why do we see water somewhere?" This
intervention that draws on literatures, spaces, people, and connections
across different Indigenous, Black, Brown, and Southern ways of knowing
enables belonging and responsibility that feels the proximity of the
wetness of the high seas that is distant or invisible.]{.underline} The
recent agreement on an ocean treaty by United Nations member countries
to protect the biological diversity of areas beyond national
jurisdiction (BBNJ) (McVeigh 2023) seems to promise collective
responsibility in conserving nourishing wetness. Indigenous, Black,
Brown, and Southern peoples strengthen commitments to flourishing
oceanic futures through their refusal of fossil-fuel extraction as well
as embodied obligations, spiritual gifts, laws, cultural protocols,
ethical principles, and calls for Rights to Sea Country. [They are
joined today in their struggles by allies, accomplices, and publics who
use western legal instruments to reshape and enforce oceanic
responsibilities in the Anthropocene.]{.underline}

Beyond National Democracy

[We do not doubt that National Democracy has had made numerous gains in
their revolutionary struggle]{.underline}. The Maoists of the National
Democrats have created liberated barrios and conducted acts of sabotage
against mining operations. They have armed peasants and indigenous
peoples against the tyranny of landlords and landgrabbers. They have
created networks of samahans\[10\] and people's organizations and
created spaces for proletarian and peasant democracy. They have
unionized workers and peasants and engaged in class struggle. **[Yet the
politics they forward is still the hierarchic and mediated politics of
the vanguard party and the potential alienation of a
state]{.underline}**. Our issues with National Democracy are too
numerous to fully discuss here. [We will focus our critique on our
opposition to a vanguard party and the harms of building yet another
state and aiming to seize state power instead of aiming for a liberated
society free from hierarchy and domination]{.underline}.\[11\] Going
beyond National Democracy means understanding why **[we need to reject
the vanguard party and the state as disempowering for the vast majority
and building an unmediated and egalitarian politics.]{.underline}**

**[Anarchists reject a vanguard party because we believe in the
universalization of political power and agency, not in its concentration
in certain party officials.]{.underline}** In centralizing power, a
vanguard party concentrates revolutionary agency into a hierarchy within
itself. In contrast we believe revolutionary agency belongs to all the
toilers and dispossessed. **[The politics of a Leninist vanguard
ultimately alienates the people it tries to liberate---once again
politics is something done to the people, not done by the
people]{.underline}**. Because of its goal of controlling the
revolution, the vanguard party is a stoppage upon the vitality of the
revolutionary movement. [Indeed, revolutionary action done outside the
control of the party is even opposed and threatened with violence by the
CPP-NPA. The Party is suspected of being behind the murders of other
revolutionary and social democratic activists after their publication
labeled other revolutionary and social democratic personalities as
"counterrevolutionary" and those named started turning up
dead]{.underline}.\[12\] The Party is then hostile to socialist
plurality and thus is hostile to a social revolution which is
fundamentally pluralistic.

How much power does rank-and-file communists of the party have on the
machinations of the CPP-NPA cadres? We doubt their influence is
considerable. Indeed during the second congress of the Communist Party
of the Philippines last October 2016, the youngest delegate was 33 years
old at the time\[13\]---the CPP is an old boy's club where the youth
rank-and-file have no sway! Indeed, it was only their second congress in
their 51 years of existence! All decisions are effectively made by a
small cadre, accountable to no-one.

[**Party officials have immense power---even power over life and
death---and are functionally only accountable to the central committee,
which is practically not accountability at all.** This concentration of
power has had violent and fatal consequences for the committed
communists cruelly tortured and murdered during the purge campaigns by
the CPP-NPA during the 1980s]{.underline}.\[14\] Cadres who were
accountable to no-one murdered their own comrades in a fit of collective
paranoia. If even without taking state power we see the CPP-NPA brutally
murdering their own communist comrades, what more if they take state
power? **[What more tyrannies would they inflict on non-party folk? It
would be state-sanctioned violence recalling the worst of the Stalinist
terrors.]{.underline}**

[**The exclusionary politics of the vanguard party is replicated in the
peace process between the government of the Philippines and the
CPP-NPA-NDF.** The peace process is a negotiation between the Philippine
government and the cadre of the CPP-NPA-NDF---essentially negotiations
between the bureaucracy of the state and the bureaucracy of the
party]{.underline}. It is a collaboration between erstwhile
revolutionaries and sections of capital and of the national
burgis.\[15\] Indeed this collaboration quickly turned into opportunism
with figures like the National Democratic figurehead Joma Sison
haphazardly endorsing Duterte for president. The people are not truly
involved in the machinations of the peace process. We doubt that the
denizens of the liberated barrios and the rank-and-file agitators---who
participate in the class struggle alongside the working class in picket
lines---actively participate in the negotiations as active agents in
their own right. We think they are instead represented in a process
mediated by others. **[The peace process is then statecraft and an
alienated politics one can only spectate in]{.underline}**. The supposed
stakeholders in the peace process are rendered mere spectators in a
process separated from them. Such is the politics of the vanguard party
where agency and power is concentrated on a select few acting on behalf
of the rest. **[Besides, a peace mediated between the elites in the
state and the elites of a vanguard party is not a durable
peace.]{.underline}** We see this with the peace process between
sections of the Bangsamoro revolutionary nationalists and the Philippine
government which historically kept generating splinter groups because
these groups felt excluded from the process.\[16\]

Ultimately, the party does not have a monopoly over resistance, however
the CPP wants to monopolize the revolution. It cannot dominate
naturally-occurring pockets of resistance that forms against greed and
tyranny.

For Anarchism

**[Instead of reformism and beyond national democracy, we forward the
liberatory politics of anarchism]{.underline}**, a movement for the
self-emancipation of the toilers and dispossessed from all forms of
hierarchy and domination.

A revolutionary anarchism is about spreading freedom and anarchy to all
spheres of life. Anarchy is about social relationships based on consent
and free agreement. It is about treating each other as equals and as
individuals we are interdependent with and whose freedom is bound up
with ours. Anarchy is freedom from authority and freedom from
hierarchies. [Doing anarchy means doing a deliberative politics that
seeks to make people full subjects in their politics.]{.underline}
Therefore anarchism shuns mediation and statecraft and seeks to maximize
the agency of people over their own lives and of things held in common.

[Anarchism is the fullest conclusion of the desire for freedom because
it is a consistent application of freedom]{.underline}. We cannot use
hierarchical means to create a liberated society. We must take care of
what our means are becoming. Hierarchy can only become domination, not
liberation. Hierarchy engenders an alienated politics where those at the
lower rungs of hierarchy are disempowered and dispossessed. As an
egalitarian idea, anarchism forwards liberatory means to create a
liberated society. **[When we instead consciously organize in an
egalitarian, non-hierarchical manner, we are building the foundations
for a social relations based on freedom. These social relations then can
become that liberated future.]{.underline}**

[A revolutionary anarchism has the tools for forwarding a liberatory
politics with tools like as mutual aid, direct action and egalitarian
organizing]{.underline}. These tools of anarchism existed in various
forms long before anarchism existed and what anarchism does is unite
these in theory and practice.

**[Anarchists practice mutual aid which as Filipinos already know as
bayanihan]{.underline}**. [Mutual aid or bayanihan is a mode of
cooperation based on solidarity. It is us helping each other because it
benefits all.]{.underline} The image of bayanihan is often a village (or
a bayan) working together to carry a house. By themselves the villagers
could not lift the house, but all together they can---their toil is
minimized with collective action. What is more is that by participating,
they know the other villagers will similarly assist them when they need
it. Thus mutual aid or bayanihan becomes a system of support and
collective action that improves the quality of life for everyone
involved. It is then a safety net that everyone can participate in.
**[These systems of mutual aid can be found in nature and in human
societies throughout history and today all around the
world]{.underline}**.\[19\] **[What anarchists want to do is
universalize mutual aid over other modes of organization like
competition, profit, or bureaucracy.]{.underline}**

**[Anarchists also practice direct action. Direct action can take the
form of strikes, rent strikes, occupations, expropriation, and blocking
construction]{.underline}**. Direct Action, according to libertarian
socialist theorist Murray Bookchin,

is the means whereby each individual awakens to the hidden powers within
herself and himself, to a new sense of self-confidence and
self-competence; it is the means whereby individuals take control of
society directly. ... Direct action, in short, is not a 'tactic' that
can be adopted or discarded in terms of its 'effectiveness' or
'popularity'; it is a moral principle, an ideal, indeed, a sensibility.
It should imbue every aspect of our lives and behavior and
outlook.\[20\]

[To add, direct action directly changes the terrain of struggle against
capital and domination.]{.underline} Through its interventions, direct
action shapes the capacities and agency of the persons doing the action
and makes them full subjects in their politics. [Through a strike for
example, the workers involved learn they have power over their boss and
this gives them the capacity to demand more and more
concessions]{.underline}. Using direct action instead of relying on
mediated forms of struggle like representative politics is a major part
in anarchist theory and praxis.\[21\] Using the unmediated politics of
direct action implies a rejection of the mediated politics of states and
vanguards.

**[Instead of states or vanguard parties, anarchists would forward the
use of horizontal and egalitarian organizing.]{.underline}** [A reason
why anarchists use egalitarian organization is that it prefigures the
kind of liberated society we seek to bring about.]{.underline} By
prefiguration we mean that the means we use now foreshadows and
envisages the future we want to bring about. **[Prefiguration is a unity
of means and ends---in this case, egalitarian means for a liberatory
end. Prefigurative politics means building the world we want to see in
the here and now]{.underline}**.\[22\] Egalitarian organizing also means
eschewing hierarchy in our organizations. This does not necessarily mean
eschewing leaders, but rather building the capacities for everyone to
lead and cooperate. [Some alternatives to leaders in egalitarian
organizing is the rotation of tasks that normally leaders do.
Instituting egalitarian organizing also does not mean rejecting scaling
up our organizations]{.underline}. Rather, scaling up egalitarian
organizing means that agency and decision-making flows from the
bottom--up rather top--bottom. This can be done with the use of mandated
delegates. [Mandated delegates cannot decide for the group they
represent like representatives in congress do]{.underline}. [The group
they represent decides the mandate of the delegate and what that
delegate can say or do.]{.underline} Alternatively, if the delegate has
a mandate for negotiation or representation in a council or assembly,
what they do is subject to ratification from the group they came from.
If these delegates overstep or fail their mandates, they can be
immediately recalled and removed as delegate. Delegates can be chosen
through sortition or rotation, though electing or consensus is also
used. These methods are few examples of preventing the concentration of
power in a position and retaining agency and political subjectivity on
the individuals and preventing the concentration of power in positions.
Egalitarian organizing helps preserve freedom and individuality of those
making decisions.

While anarchists believe in freedom, we do not believe in burgis notions
of freedom and burgis individuality. Freedom to starve, the freedom to
exploit, the freedom to of choosing our boss---these are no freedoms at
all! Our freedom is based on the communization of social life, where our
freedom is guarded and enhanced by the freedom of those around us. Only
when society as a whole is liberated will we be free to fully express
our individuality, free from the constraints of domination. Until then,
individuality under capitalism would usually be limited to consumption
and the demands of capital. Our freedom is bound up together and we will
be free when we regard our fellow siblings as equals and free.

**[The possibility for freedom and total liberation opens up in a social
revolution.]{.underline}** A social revolution is not a simple change of
leaders like the EDSA 1/People Power Revolution of 1986 and the EDSA 2
of 2001. It is not a coup by the vanguard party and the takeover of
government. [A social revolution is the blossoming of
possibilities]{.underline}. It is a time when what was previously
thought unthinkable enters the realm of possibility. It is a time for a
break with the past and a new way of doing things. It is social
transformation in the political, social, economic, and interpersonal
relations. A social revolution is liberating because the illusions of
control by capital and the state have shattered and the people learn
that they have their own power to enact change as full subjects in their
own right. [Social revolutions like those in the past in Russia, Spain,
and Cuba are inherently liberatory where people spontaneously develop
new forms of social relations that heighten their agency and political
subjectivity]{.underline}. Revolutionary anarchists agitate for this
social revolution because a break with the past is the best time for the
promulgation of libertarian ideas and practices.\[23\]

**[These anarchist theories and praxis have applications for the
archipelago]{.underline}**. After all, anarchism is not a foreign
western idea being supplemented into Philippine soil, it is an idea
about liberation and the universalization of this liberation. Anarchism
is universalizable because freedom is universalizable.\[24\] [The ideas
that people can and should manage their own affairs, that workers should
manage their workplaces, that indigenous peoples are the best managers
of their land, and that a community in discussion with its citizens are
its best administrators are all universalizable]{.underline}. Just as it
is inevitable that the labor under the capitalist process necessarily
creates more value than what is paid to the laborer in order to maintain
profit margins, anarchism holds that where there is authority, there is
tension against it; where there is hierarchy in decision-making, its
alienation from the disempowered will be felt.

**[Because of this universalizablity, the principles of anarchism---of
opposition to tyranny, to capitalism, to hierarchy, and to the
state---are reborn in each and every generation]{.underline}**. [The
ideas of anarchy was born to the ancient Taoists meditating upon the
wu-wei and wu-jin, and to ancient Skeptics and Cynics of the Hellenic
world. Anarchy was reborn to the anarchist theorists of the 19th century
and to the anarchists revolutionaries of 20th century in Shinmin,
Ukraine, Spain. The hope for anarchy lives again today in the
libertarian revolutionaries of our own time in Rojava, Chiapas, and
Kabylia. Where there is tyranny, there will be opposition to it; where
there is injustice, a cry for liberation. Anarchism is not its theorists
or revolutionists---Bakuninism, Proudhonianism, Kropotkinism, or
Makhnovism.]{.underline} Anarchism is an-archos, without rulers. Should
all anarchists today be killed by the vilest reaction, should such a
reaction burn all the books of anarchist theory and erase the memory of
libertarian praxis, anarchism will not die for the very essence of
freedom, of opposition to authority, of a liberated society, cannot die.
**[Indeed, anarchism was already wiped out once]{.underline}** [in
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines in the early 20th
century]{.underline} **[yet in these countries anarchism reemerges from
its ashes, again ready to rally to cause of liberty and
freedom]{.underline}**.

#### Statecraft DA -- it is a concentration of power that stops [liberation]{.underline}. Anarchist organizing solves better historically.

**[While anarchists may reject the Leninist vanguard party, anarchists
are not opposed to revolutionary organization]{.underline}**. Anarchists
understand the necessity of creating networks and structures between
movements. Indeed there have been anarchist and libertarian
revolutionary organizations throughout history and some that still exist
today. [Historical examples include the Black Army in Ukraine, the
CNT-FAI in Spain, and Korean Anarchist Communist Federation in Shinmin.
Examples of libertarian revolutionary organizations that exist today are
the Zapatistas in Chiapas, and the YPG-YPJ in Rojava]{.underline}.
Another reason for this opposition to the vanguard party is that
anarchists reject their quest for state power.

**[We anarchists reject the state and reject seizing state power as a
strategy for liberation because as the preeminent manifestation of
hierarchy, it is acutely insufficient for liberation]{.underline}**.
This does not mean we are against organization and institutions, but
rather we believe these ought be organized in a libertarian and
egalitarian manner. **[After all, the state is not merely its
organization nor its institutions.]{.underline}** [Nor is the state its
provision of social services nor merely its prerogative for
violence]{.underline}. [The state is a territorial concentration of
power in the hands of a few situated above society---to use the
definition by anarchist writer Pëtr Kropotkin.\[17\] The state is power
excluding the society at large]{.underline}. **[The state is necessarily
a concentration of power, otherwise the institution would not be a
state.]{.underline}** The concentration of power in the hands of a few
implies a social relationship where power---particularly its
decision-making form---is held by a minority where the majority is
excluded and therefore disempowered under the state.

[Just as the Communist Party concentrates power unto itself, just so
their future state would hoard power into its own
structure]{.underline}. **[The National Democratic construction of a
future proletarian state will ultimately reproduce statecraft and an
alienated politics because of their continuing use of
hierarchies]{.underline}**.

While the **[Marxists-Leninists]{.underline}**---and by extension
National Democrats---are absolutely correct in wanting to abolish the
capitalist social relations such as those of burgis--proletariat, they
**[stop short of wanting to abolish hierarchical social relations
altogether.]{.underline}** Marxist-Leninist societies in the former USSR
and the Eastern Bloc states abolished the burgis, but were still
hierarchical societies. Going beyond National Democracy also means
understanding why hierarchy itself must be dismantled, not just
capitalist social relations. **[Hierarchy itself must be opposed and
dismantled in order to secure a free and liberated
future]{.underline}**.

#### Party organizing relies on [nationalism]{.underline}, which is terminally unsustainable. Moving beyond a party/state focus is necessary for archipelagic liberation.

[As we reject the state that the National Democrats aim for**, we also
reject their nationalism. Nationalism in socialism is an abomination and
it creates deep contradictions in theory.**]{.underline} [The very
concept of nationalism is precisely a trans-class solidarity between the
proletariat and the burgis in a particular country]{.underline}. **[This
trans-class solidarity makes it appear that the burgis and proletariat
of a particular country have the same interests---they do not. This thus
masks the contradictions and struggles between the two
classes.]{.underline}** [The toilers and dispossessed have no interests
in common with the class of oligarchs, hacienderos, political dynasties,
and warlords.]{.underline} **[It is the trans-class solidarity of
nationalism that leads to class collaboration and the betrayal of the
interests of the dispossessed.]{.underline}**

Make no mistake, we anarchists are not calling for the fragmentation of
struggle or a parochialism of isolated groups. **[Instead of nationalism
and a unity based on identity, we want unity on the basis of the
affinity of all who struggle for liberation]{.underline}**.\[18\] All
those who despise tyranny and greed are our comrades. We are in
solidarity with the oppressed not because we are both Filipino, but
because we understand that our liberation are tied up together.

The National Democratic program for a state is insufficiently
liberatory. [Their project of a vanguard party is stuck in the past and
is led by a entrenched cadre of old men.]{.underline} Relinquishing your
agency to the party bureaucrats of the vanguard does not liberate you.
[The aim of capturing state power or setting up a competing
revolutionary state reproduces the mediating and alienating politics
that renders people as objects of statecraft and does not empower
them]{.underline}. Going beyond National Democracy does not necessarily
mean rejecting everything the National Democratic movement does or what
they stand for, but understanding that their praxis is limited by their
use of hierarchy and is thus ultimately insufficient for the goal of
liberation[. Therefore the politics they forward is still a continuation
of hierarchy and domination and cannot forward a liberatory
politics.]{.underline} National democrats take their poetry from the
past; we must take our poetry from the future.

**[To revitalize revolutionary politics in the archipelago we need to
move beyond National Democracy, beyond vanguard party form, beyond the
state, and beyond nationalism. This means a commitment to a deliberative
politics and shunning hierarchy and domination in our revolutionary
organizations]{.underline}**. **[We anarchists do not aim to control and
dominate a revolution but to build the capacities of people for direct
action, mutual aid, and revolutionary action to allow a social
revolution to bloom into its fullest potential. The liberation of the
working class and of the dispossessed can only be done by them alone and
will never be done by a state or a mediating party.]{.underline}**

Towards an Anarchism in the Archipelago

Where does anarchism then situate itself in the archipelago known as the
Philippines?

Historically, **[it is plausible that there existed indigenous groups in
the archipelago that organized non-hierarchically and therefore
anarchically]{.underline}**. [After all, the Ifugao people carved the
very mountains in a monumental effort all without use of governments or
states]{.underline}. However it is mistaken to proclaim that anarchy was
the mode of governance before colonization as this falls into a romantic
notion of a 'noble savage' or a 'pure' indigeneity unsullied by the
state. [In reality, indigenous peoples---indeed all peoples---have
widely diverse ways of organizing themselves.]{.underline} There have
been hunter-gatherers that organize hierarchically and urban people that
organize in an egalitarian manner.\[25\]

**[Where Anarchism can situate itself in the archipelago is in the
history of struggle against authority.]{.underline}** [Anarchism in the
archipelago is but a young member in the long line of indigenous
opposition to colonial authority and domination.]{.underline} Roger
White says it best that anarchism finds itself as part of a family of
other anti-authoritarian struggles throughout history:

A different way of understanding anarchism in relation to the
centuries-old struggle against arbitrary power is to view it as the
newest member of a global family that includes numerous historical and
present day communal societies and struggles against authority. **[The
village communalism of the Ibo, and First Nations like the Zuni and the
Hopi are a part of the family. The indigenous autonomist movements for
self determination going on today in West Papua and Chiapas, Mexico with
the EZLN are a part of the family.]{.underline}** [**The international
prison abolitionist movement,** perhaps to most coordinated attack on
the state's monopoly of the administration of justice, has deep
anti-authoritarian currents, just as the numerous stateless hunter and
gatherer bands, clans, and nomadic tribes that have managed to survive
centuries without armies, flags, or money systems do.\[26\]]{.underline}

[Thus working within this post-colonial framework we find that the
Indokumentado (the undocumented natives) and the rebels of the Dagohoy
Rebellion who resisted the efforts of the Spanish colonial authority to
constrain them to labor camps to be the natural forebears to an
anarchism in the archipelago]{.underline}. **[Anarchism in the
archipelago situates itself in the innumerable acts of resistance
against the colonizers and their institutional descendant in the
state]{.underline}**. While anarchism is a relatively recent phenomenon,
anarchistic elements very much already exist in the archipelago for as
long as there has been resistance to tyranny and greed.

[A bookmark in the situating an anarchism in the archipelago is Isabelo
de los Reyes. Tutored by anarchists and revolutionary socialists while
exiled in Catalonia, Isabelo de los Reyes brought Marxist and Anarchist
theories to the Philippines in 1901 during the American colonial
period.]{.underline} He used the principles of Marx and Malatesta to set
up the Union Obrera Democratica (UOD), the first labor union federation
in the Philippines. While not specifically anarchist, the UOD did
incorporate mutual aid and direct action into their praxis and was a
thorn on the side of the American colonial administration.\[27\]

[A later example of anarchistic elements in Philippine history is the
Diliman Commune which was a student uprising against the Marcos
administration in 1971]{.underline}. While the uprising was
ideologically influenced by National Democracy, it contained several
anarchistic elements. Being a spontaneous uprising, it was not dominated
and directed by a vanguard party. Revolutionary students and faculty
used direct action in defense of their commune instead of relying on
representatives and mediators. Power was not monopolized by a few select
leaders and decisions were made in an egalitarian manner in councils and
assemblies using consensus.\[28\]

Anarchistic elements also emerge in more contemporary times. [Land and
housing struggles in the Philippines are sometimes fought with direct
action. The urban housing group Kadamay in 2017 used direct action to
occupy and directly expropriate empty homes in Bulacan by occupying them
with families in need of a home.]{.underline} They were also able to
defend this expropriation through direct action to the point of even
President Duterte conceding the issue. Indeed, they were even decried as
"anarchists," much to the chagrin of their national democratic
orientation.\[29\]

[We also see direct action in the countryside. Peasant groups use direct
action to till idle land they do not own in a practice called
bungkalan.]{.underline} Instead of relying on the notoriously slow and
corrupt Department for Agrarian Reform to expropriate land from
landlords and oligarchs, these farmers do it themselves and hurt no-one
except property rights in the process. [Peasant group Kilusang
Magbubukid ng Pilipinas has called bungkalan a "collective efforts of
farmers to assert genuine land reform."\[30\] Bungkalan then becomes a
form of resistance against feudal landholders who hoard land for
themselves]{.underline}.

[Direct action is also practiced by environmental activists. In Palawan,
environmental activists take it upon themselves to confiscate chainsaws
and guns from illegal loggers and poachers.\[]{.underline}31\] These
activists understand that if the state cannot protect their
environments, they will have to do it themselves, sometimes at the cost
of their lives.

[Direct action also dovetails with mutual aid. After the reemergence of
anarchism in the archipelago, Food Not Bombs organizations were set up
as systems of mutual aid/bayanihan.]{.underline} Food Not Bombs are
networks of mutual aid that freely distribute food among indigent
people. These networks are organized along anarchist lines using
voluntary association and egalitarian organizing.\[32\] Rather than
waiting for an authority to organize food distribution or lobbying for
such a thing in congress, Food Not Bombs does it themselves. They are
able to distribute food to people all the while rejecting the use of
hierarchical organization.

Beyond anarchistic elements in existing movements, it can be argued that
anarchy already exists all around us, as Bas Umali suggests in his essay
Anarki: Akin ang Buhay Ko -- Sariling Determinasyon at Pagpapasya Tungo
sa Panlipunang Rebolusyon.\[33\] For Umali, anarchy is mutual
cooperation without need of coercion or payment. Anarchy is whenever we
relate to each other as equals and peers and whenever we discuss among
ourselves the issues we have instead of relying on an authority figure.
We already naturally organize ourselves in egalitarian and
non-hierarchical lines when we organize among friends. Human cooperation
is already natural.\[34\] What anarchists want is for all social
relations to be organized under egalitarian lines with free association
and free from hierarchy and coercion.

**[These examples of anarchistic elements---Mutual aid/bayanihan, direct
action and egalitarian organizing---are then not foreign
ideas]{.underline}**. **[They already exist today in our lives and in
our contexts. These elements---which are already anarchistic---can be
reused for an anarchist praxis.]{.underline}** What anarchists in the
archipelago want is to universalize these anarchistic elements and
universalize freedom and liberation.

Currently, anarchists in the archipelago have been able to create spaces
for autonomy and mutual aid such as infoshops and Foot Not Bombs
networks. Infoshops are spaces for the dissemination and propagation of
anarchist materials and are sites for autonomous organizing. These
Infoshops and Food Not Bombs are embedded in urban communities and
conduct community outreach and mutual aid activities. These are spaces
where anarchist principles can be practiced and taught. When there is a
need for local action such as in resisting evictions, these local
anarchist groups mobilize for these tasks.

[However, while creating spaces for autonomy away from state, capital,
and hierarchies are good it is still insufficient for liberation for
revolutionary anarchists. We revolutionary anarchists are not content
with spaces for autonomy, we desire total liberation for
all]{.underline}. More than an autonomous anarchism, we must forward a
revolutionary anarchism in the archipelago. Much more than creating
autonomous spaces, this revolutionary anarchism aims to challenge
capital and the state. [By revolutionary we mean a movement to abolish
the current state of things, to challenge hierarchy and domination and
not merely carve spaces for autonomy.]{.underline}

**[We see a tension between the country's canonical and mythic
continental borders and its noncanonical and material oceanic
borders]{.underline}**. As much as the tyranny of the continent has
remained active in US political rhetoric as we enter the third decade of
the twenty-first century, and even as it has had profound material
consequences for the emergence and continued existence of a US empire of
small islands, [**the United States' fetishization of its continental
vastness lost its geographically material warrant in 1983, when the
country became, as relayed by NOAA, "an ocean nation,"** embracing the
doctrine of the eez and thereby claiming an ocean area larger than the
land area of all fifty states.]{.underline} In other words, while
present day US demographers take pains to accurately forecast a date in
the future when the United States will no longer be a majority-white
country (and while prominent modes of demagoguery in the United States
seek to mobilize white voting and vigilante constituencies by playing on
white fears of the new tyrannies that a future nonwhite majority may
usher in), scholarly and popular perception of US geography has largely
fallen asleep with regard to a crucial shift that has long since taken
place: owing to the eez's interactions with the islands and
archipelagoes that are claimed as US territories, [the United States
lost its hallowed geographic status as a majority-continent nation
nearly four decades ago.22 It became a majority ocean
nation.]{.underline}

In the introduction to our edited collection Archipelagic American
Studies (2017), Michelle Ann Stephens and I traced some ways in which
the US transformation from majority-continent to majority-ocean was
underway long before the arrival of UNCLOS in 1982[. We have pointed to
several watershed moments as preconditions for this transformation: the
Guano Islands Act of 1856, the Spanish-American War of 1898, the illegal
annexation of Hawai'i in the same year, the purchase of American Samoa
in 1899, and US control of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands
a-er World War II and into the 1980s and 1990s. **We argued that "as the
energies of Manifest Destiny shifted from wayfaring across the continent
to seafaring in the Caribbean and the Pacific, the United States
constructed an imperial archipelago that
deformed**]{.underline}---[stretched, twisted, and finally
fractured---\[the country's\] entity status to the point of a
topological shift," wherein a shift in the topology or form of national
geography constituted a shift in **national ontology**.]{.underline}23
With this ontological shift, the United States has moved from Paine's
vision of US American sovereignty stemming from its fundamental
continental form, to Roosevelt's affirmation that the imperial United
States of the early twentieth century continued to be based on a
continent, to NOAA's astounding assertion that (as stated by the map
title) "The United States is an Ocean Nation." The iconic stars that
spangle a &eld of blue: these have represented US states to generations
of schoolchildren. But might NOAA's articulation of the country admit a
new symbology, wherein the canonized US states and the territorial US
states may be seen to Dow into one another, to mingle and grate against
each other in the blue waters, amid the storms and stresses of an ocean
nation that has, contra Paine, no nature-inscribed logic for
sovereignty, coherence, or existence? The Dag's star-spangled blue
ocean, then, becomes a site amenable to the existential seeking
described in 1946 by the US American writer Carlos Bulosan, who was a US
national because he was born in the US territory of the Philippines but
who was nonetheless ineligible for US citizenship. Bulosan at one point
envisioned stars Doating in the blue ocean---in desperation and hope at
what he found while reading literature in the continental United States,
he imagined "boring through the earth's core, leveling all seas and
oceans, swimming in the constellations."24 What constellations might we
swim among, in an ocean spangled with a gyre of canonical and
noncanonical US states? What are the borders and waters that imperfectly
divide and incompletely unify these states of grating coalitions and
dissensions, histories and futures?

[Whether or not we adopt NOAA's phrase "ocean nation," the purpose of
the present study is not to play into the notions of geographic majority
and minority that have undergirded the tyranny of the continent during
the course of centuries.]{.underline} Borderwaters does not seek to
usher in continental tyranny's mirror image, a tyranny of the ocean, by
simply presenting readers with a version of national geography in which
the United States is the largest oceanic nation in the world, with
claims to oceanic territory that exceed its claims to continental
territory, and with claims, furthermore, to only a minority share of the
very continent to which it has staked its popular geographic
self-perception as a nation. As close as that view might hew to the
materiality of the lands and waters that the United States claims as its
territory, modes of predictable and unpredictable demagoguery would lurk
within this tack's continued fetishization of geographic size. Hence,
Borderwaters, even as it works to undercut continental exceptionalism,
does not pit the ocean or the island against the continent. And [**it is
certainly not an endorsement of any past or present US land or water
claims, many of which have been and continue to be legitimately
contested by Indigenous groups, and all of which** (however permanent
the present-day borders of the United States may seem)]{.underline}
**[will certainly shift and even disappear in the future, depending on
how distant a future we set our sights on.]{.underline}** Rather,
Borderwaters is concerned with what the volume Archipelagic American
Studies describes as **["'the archipelagic Americas,]{.underline}**' [or
the temporally shift- ing and spatially splayed set of islands, island
chains, and island-oceancontinent relations which have exceeded US
Americanism and have been affiliated with and indeed constitutive of
competing notions of the Americas since at least 1492]{.underline}."25
**[Within that collection's model, the archipelagic Americas span over
five centuries and are not circumscribed by US imperialism, US
territorial claims, or US existence]{.underline}**. Consequently, essays
in that volume interrogate the archipelagic Americas in space-times
ranging from seventeenth-century Mexico to twenty-first-century New
Zealand and Canada and from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to the
francophone Caribbean. Distinct from Archipelagic American Studies in
scope and purpose, Borderwaters speaks to a more focused set of
coordinates in space and time, redescribing the United States and its
planetary embeddedness in a way that &nds touchstones in
twentieth-century cultural-ecological events: epoch-de&ning scholarly
narratives regarding the United States, nuclear weapons that rescript
warfare and wreak environmental devastation, hurricanes in the Pacific
and Caribbean, literary writings that are geoformally attentive, US
deployments of non-Euclidean geometries amid the oceans, the World War
II--era carving of stone containing fossils of half-a-billion-year-old
sea creatures, a world's fair that turned the Pacific into a pageant.
These and other events set up the preconditions for the United States'
late twentieth-century territorial shift to a terraqueous national
ontology and the early twenty-first-century possibilities of its
emergence as self-conscious regarding this shift. [In so doing,
Borderwaters disrupts the continent's exceptionalist and even tyrannical
claims by giving place to the interrelated land-water complexes of the
archipelago and the borderwaters.]{.underline}

**[What Is an Archipelago?]{.underline}**

Because I do not want to pit the preponderant materialities of US ocean
and island spaces against the enduring if geographically unmoored
metaphor of the United States as a fundamentally continental nation[, I
gravitate in this study toward the term archipelago, along with its
adjectival form, archipelagic]{.underline}. (Pronouncing the latter term
can be a bit tricky for many English speakers, but it is central enough
to this study that it warrants mention that, based on the guidance of
reputable dictionaries, speakers of US and British English should
pronounce archipelagic so that the initial arch- rhymes with snark and
the &nal -lagic rhymes with magic. 26) **[The term archipelago has the
benefit of operating very clearly at the intersection of the material
and the metaphorical]{.underline}**. [**It also admits, like the allied
term terraqueous, both water and land** (including, as we shall see,
continents) **to its suite of ontological and epistemological
concerns**]{.underline}. In its entry for the term archipelago, the
Oxford English Dictionary (oed), in both the second edition of 1989 and
the current online edition, notes that the word derives from the Italian
arcipelago, with arci- signifying "chief, principal" and -pelago
signifying "deep, abyss, gulf, pool." The entry clarifies that the term,
while drawing on Greek roots, does not derive from "ancient or mediæval
Greek" but developed first in early modern "western languages" such as
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. From there, it was imported
into Modern Greek. The oed's first definition for archipelago appears as
follows: "The Ægean Sea, between Greece and Asia Minor," with the first
such usage listed as occurring in 1268 in a treaty "between the
Venetians and the emperor Michael Palaeologus." The term's second
de&nition points toward the planetary deployment of the first de&nition
as a metaphor: "Hence (as \[the Aegean\] is studded with many isles):
Any sea, or sheet of water, in which there are numerous islands; and
\[in a transferred sense\] a group of islands." The dictionary's
examples for this latter usage date from 1529 to about 1860, with the
term archipelago, this erstwhile synonym for the Aegean, applied to
island groups situated in what we now think of as Indonesia, the Arctic
Ocean, the Pacific, and the North Atlantic.27 Interestingly, the
definitions and examples provided by the oed's second and online
editions remain unchanged from those included in the dictionary's first
edition (1933) and, looking further back, unchanged from those included
in the oed's late nineteenth-century forerunner, A New English
Dictionary on Historical Principles (ned). **[Indeed, as of the present
writing, the online OED repeats verbatim the NED's original definition
and usage examples for archipelago as first offered in the
1880s]{.underline}**.28

the sound of repressed and ghostly voices**. These dark, icy depths tell
us how the Arctic haunted minds and bodies,]{.underline} **[stretching

the exercise of sovereignty at a state level.]{.underline}** **[Yet
taking account of the diversity of voices involved in Arctic exploration
requires that we move beyond an exclusive focus on representations to an
engagement with the 'non- representational' also.]{.underline}**
Scholars of global exploration have highlighted the varieties of actors
involved in the cultures of exploration but, when it comes to the ways
western navigators and travellers thought about exotic and unmapped
regions of land and sea, there has been a tendency to focus on the
visual or representational -- what they 'saw' over what they
'experienced' (see for example Smith, 1985; Stafford, 1999). [This focus
has undoubtedly brought out cogent themes in histories of imperial
discovery (see Rose, 1993) but it has also resulted in a tendency to
take bodies for granted.]{.underline}

#### Western imaginations of the Arctic view it as a place of dread and exoticism -- we as individuals are implicated as well.

Making Arctic Place

British explorers in the Arctic, particularly those who produced and
circulated knowledge, were bound by fundamental somatic and envir-
onmental conditions. These conditions influenced the way they behaved,
they way they moved and they way they thought. A question frequently
asked of someone researching polar history is 'Have you been there?'
[The implication is that physical presence in the Arctic or Antarctic --
however these locations are defined -- provides access to knowledge and
feelings that libraries and archives do not offer, but must form part of
any ana- lysis. But how is place really being made here and by
whom]{.underline}?

**[The explorer's body, located at the centre of knowledge
production,]{.underline}** [something that so impresses people who
imagine the polar regions to be inaccessible,]{.underline} **[is also a
dreaming body]{.underline}**: 'I work, read, think, and dream' wrote
Nansen of his Arctic routine onboard the Fram (1897, I, 260); else-
where he quoted Edvard Grieg in describing the environment: '\[T\]‌ hat
is where the reality became a dream, and the dream became reality!'
(Nansen, 1897, 202). Nansen put his finger on precisely the kind of
perception I am interested in -- a dreamlike perception that was tied up
with people's Arctic encounters. **[Comments such as this suggest that
in experiences like polar dreaming or armchair travelling]{.underline}**
**[to the Arctic]{.underline}** [from Britain, people's travel
**involved bodily movements and the sensing of otherworlds beyond the
body.**]{.underline}

**[In western imaginations the Arctic was something constructed over
time, an assembly of myths and testimonies that marked out the region as
exotic]{.underline}**. For Europeans, biblical ideas of the North as the
domain of Satan were succeeded by the medieval ideas of Ultima Thule and
early modern visions of gold or quick access to the Indies (Franklin,
2008). By the era of the Northwest Passage quest, the attribution of a
type of non- human agency to the Arctic regions was common in British
culture. The strangeness of the light, the flashes of the Aurora
Borealis and, above all, the phantasmagoric ice contributed to the idea
of the north as a realm of fantastic spectacles. Just as there came to
be a way that Africa or the African 'should look' (Neumann, 1998, 1),
popular representations of the Arctic tended to cluster around the idea
of a sublime wilderness.16

Although describing a voyage to the Antarctic regions, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798) was in part inspired
by Arctic sources and therefore reproduces many of the stereo- typical
and aesthetic features of the icescape:

Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind, A Wind and Tempest strong! For days
and weeks it play'd us freaks -- Like Chaff we drove along.

Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow, And it grew wond'rous cauld: And Ice
mast- high came floating by As green as Emerauld.

And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts Did send a dismal sheen; Ne shapes
of men ne beasts we ken -- The Ice was all between.

The Ice was here, the Ice was there, The Ice was all around: It crack'd
and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd -- Like noises of a swound. (2011,
63-- 4)

**[The 'otherness' in such representations of ice suggests the currency
of colonial readings of the Arctic as a place of desire and
dread]{.underline}**. **[Like other colonial locations, the Arctic was
already cognitively mapped before it was explored,]{.underline}**
painted with a palette of British preconceptions and visions. At the
beginning of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus
(1831 (original 1818)) Captain Walton writes to his sister that he tried
in vain 'to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and
desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of
beauty and delight' (Shelley, 1831, 3). Walton's fantasies of geographic
and scientific discovery were incubated by the narratives of Arctic
explor- ation he found in his uncle's library, but it is significant
that he was dir- ectly inspired to voyage north by The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner:

I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthu- siasm
for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean, to that production of the most
imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul,
which I do not understand. I am practically ­ industrious -- pains-
taking; -- a workman to execute with perseverance and labour:-- but
besides this, there is a love for the marvellous, intertwined in all my
projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to
the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore (Shelley, 1831,
9).

**[Walton's reading reminds us of the predetermined nature of Arctic
dreams]{.underline}**. These textual representations were extremely
influential in framing the way future British explorers and audiences
described the North. Ships were also floating libraries and, as Urban
Wråkberg (2007) points out, the work of the explorer also entailed
sitting in an armchair and sifting through the accounts of previous
navigators (explorers were also voracious readers of polar fiction and
poetry; see Karamanski, 1984). When an explorer returned to Britain, his
narrative would undergo further processes of mediation and translation,
through what Bill Bell terms 'filters of technology and taste' (2013).
The search for sub- lime Arctic experiences -- Walton's 'love for the
marvellous' -- must there- fore be thought of as something that involved
intertextual dream- work. Explorers travelled through ice- fields of
narrative, past bergs hiding masses of latent myths beneath their
surface, all of which formed a 'con- stellation of ideas' that
determined how the region was imagined (Said, 1995, 5; see also Driver,
2001).

#### Vote neg on presumption: they conflate scholarship with praxis, leverage the existing work of activists, and do not present a metric for how much careful guesswork is enough to vote affirmative. Scholarship already exists, which means the status quo solves, but they demotivate teams from engaging in revolutionary strategies which pacifies activism and does nothing. 

#### The affirmative's epistemology-focus is a form of consciousness-raising that maintains a colonial status quo.

[Fanon told us]{.underline} in 1963 [that decolonizing the mind is the
first step]{.underline}, not the only step toward overthrowing colonial
regimes. [Yet we wonder whether another settler move to innocence is to
focus on decolonizing the mind]{.underline}, or the cultivation of
critical consciousness, [as if it were the sole activity of
decolonization]{.underline}; to allow conscientization to stand in for
the more uncomfortable task of relinquishing stolen land. We agree that
[curricula, literature, and pedagogy can be crafted to aid people in
learning to see settler colonialism, to articulate critiques of settler
epistemology, and set aside settler histories and values in search of
ethics that reject domination and exploitation]{.underline}; this is not
unimportant work. [However, the front-loading of critical consciousness
building can waylay decolonization, even though the experience of
teaching and learning to be critical of settler colonialism can be so
powerful it can feel like it is indeed making change.]{.underline}
[Until stolen land is relinquished, critical consciousness does not
translate into action that disrupts settler colonialism]{.underline}.
So, we respectfully disagree with George Clinton and Funkadelic (1970)
and En Vogue (1992) when they assert that if you "free your mind, the
rest (your ass) will follow."

Paulo Freire, eminent education philosopher, popular educator, and
liberation theologian, wrote his celebrated book, Pedagogy of the
Oppressed, in no small part as a response to Fanon's Wretched of the
Earth. Its influence upon critical pedagogy and on the practices of
educators committed to social justice cannot be overstated. Therefore,
it is important to point out significant differences between Freire and
Fanon, especially with regard to de/colonization. [Freire situates the
work of liberation in the minds of the oppressed, an abstract category
of dehumanized worker vis-a-vis a similarly abstract category of
oppressor. This is a sharp right turn away from Fanon's work, which
always positioned the work of liberation in the particularities of
colonization, in the specific structural and interpersonal categories of
Native and settler.]{.underline} [Under Freire's paradigm, it is unclear
who the oppressed are, even more ambiguous who the oppressors
are]{.underline}, and it is inferred throughout that an innocent third
category of enlightened human exists: "those who suffer with \[the
oppressed\] and fight at their side" (Freire, 2000, p. 42). These words,
taken from the opening dedication of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, invoke
the same settler fantasy of mutuality based on sympathy and suffering.

#### Turn and no solvency -- Archipelagic thinking essentializes colonized peoples.

Of course [archipelagic communication is not necessarily
emancipatory]{.underline}: the challenge of physical separation
[and]{.underline} multiplicity [might have the opposite
effect]{.underline}. Just as languages lose their poetic charge when
globalised, so [the discourse of the archipelago might have to be
artificially unified and differentiated from discourse at
large]{.underline}. Cribb and Ford explain [how the archipelago can be
used 'to highlight the way in which dispersed institutions are able to
have an identity because the physical distance that separates them is
trumped by the social distance that detaches them from
their]{.underline} immediate [environment but unites them with each
other.']{.underline} They cite Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago where
'islands of incarceration shared a way of life and complex social
network in which people, goods and information were exchanged, but as
islands they were detached from the society around them.'4 [Contrast
this]{.underline} constellated island metaphor [with the anti-centralist
'archipelagic confederation' promoted by Filipino anarchist]{.underline}
writer, Bas [Umali:]{.underline} ['a structure that
connects]{.underline} and interlinks politically an economically every
community in the archipelago, **[without the need for a centralised
state]{.underline}**. It would consist of networks of autonomous
villages (barangays), together comprising regional assemblies in which
translocal coordination could take place. These regional assemblies in
turn would constitute an archipelago wide assembly.5

#### The idea that their academic speech act is radical commodifies the material work of institutional resistance, which plays into the hands of elites.

COLONIZATION OF "RADICAL POLITICS",
https://lbsbaltimore.com/the-colonization-of-radical-politics/

Radical as a brand, not as politics **[American capitalism has mastered
the ability to commodify radical political figures, histories, and
movements]{.underline}**. Most relevant to this discussion are two
particular ways that this happens. The first way involves selected
histories that are popularized in order to encourage a certain line of
political thought. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's position on non-violence
is a great example of this. We are taught a version of Dr. King's work
that elevates his non-violent approach and minimizes his eventual
condemnation of capitalism and his opposition to the imperialist war
against Vietnam. Subsequently, we have a distorted perspective of King's
confrontation with the white supremacist status quo that frames his
effectiveness on his ability to appeal to the moral sensibilities of
white people. In other words, we are taught that getting white people to
recognize our pain and suffering is how to empower our community. This
discourages us from disrupting the system and building independent Black
institutions. **[The second way that this commodification happens is by
advancing the notion that any activity that is understood to be
generally disruptive, controversial, or evoking radical rhetoric is
itself radical]{.underline}**. [The best example of this is the
so-called "resistance" that has emerged since the election of Donald
Trump]{.underline}. **[The resistance is described as fighting white
supremacy and patriarchy, and challenging the status quo, merely because
of a particular set of espoused statements of radicalism]{.underline}**.
Standing in solidarity with dreamers, or protesting the Muslim ban, or
wearing a pink hat are gestures that are often associated with "the
resistance." **[This is a form of incorporated resistance where
activists, professors, non-profit professionals, etc are allowed to make
grand statements of resistance or even revolution, but ultimately their
ability to confront and change the actual structures of power is
inhibited.]{.underline}** This fact will be further explained later.
[The point here is that commodification is carried out when an activity
or rhetoric that is generally understood to be disruptive is
characterized as radical, regardless of whether or not it actually
challenges the existing power arrangement]{.underline}. **[The term
radical simply becomes a brand]{.underline}** that is used to compete
for attention and recognition as a warrior of social justice **[without
any accountability for producing material results]{.underline}**. White
leftists absorption of Black politics White progressive, leftist and
liberal political and social formations have a parasitic relationship to
Black people and our suffering. Harold Cruse describes in his work
"Crisis of the Negro Intellectual" the way in which white liberals
(which in the context of Cruse's work includes socialists and
communists) position themselves, institutionally, as the arbiters of
Black political thought. He writes: The Negro intellectuals of today are
the victims of the intellectual default of yesterday. The intellectual,
theoretical, and cultural methods of self-orientation and
self-leadership have been taken out of their hands. The Negro
intellectual has been bereft of the means of solving his own problems
because his class has traditionally been maneuvered into the position
where his problems are solved by others. Instead of being able to essay
his own solutions, the Negro intellectual has been transformed into a
problem by the white liberal, who prefers to keep him in that position.
The white liberal problem solver has been institutionalized as an
organic part of the entire civil rights movement and is the emasculator
of the creative and intellectual potential of the Negro intelligentsia.
Negro intellectuals cannot effectively interpret themselves in the arts,
in social criticism, in the social sciences, in research fields, etc;
nor can they make objective interpretations of their own relation to the
American scene that have any impact on American affairs. Harold Cruse
\"Crisis of the Negro Intellectual\" Baked into the political and
intellectual ethos of white liberals, progressives, and leftists are the
belief that their fight for social justice is about solving Black
people's problems, which implies that we are not capable of doing that
ourselves. This obsession on the part of white people with trying to
solve Black people's suffering distracts from the more legitimate
political and intellectual endeavor of dealing with the pathology of
white people's collective proclivity toward oppression. Toni Morrison
does this beautifully in her 1993 interview with Charlie Rose when she
says: The people who practice racism are bereft, that there is something
distorted about the psyche, its a huge waste... its a profound neurosis
nobody examines. It is crazy, it feels crazy... I am not a victim, I
refuse to be one. Toni Morrison \"I Love Myself When I am Smiling and
Then Again When I Look Mean\" Even though there is discussion in white
liberal spaces about issues like white privilege, there is often too
much attention paid to Black suffering and not enough attention paid to
the "profound neurosis" that characterizes the social and political
behavior of white people that control white liberal/progressive
institutions. [Given the fact that white people control many of the
mainstream institutions that curate which Black people are given
legitimacy in particular political and social circles (i.e.,
Universities, non-profits, philanthropy, mainstream labor organizations,
mainstream, and progressive media), Black people often find ourselves
navigating a political economy where our livelihoods and our political
and social viability is dependent on seeking approval from white
liberals and the institutions that they control]{.underline}. **[Rarely
are there authentic public conversations among Black people who identify
as radicals about this dynamic because it would expose uncomfortable
truths and, quite frankly, ineptitudes that would discredit their claims
that they are radical.]{.underline}**

NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE

**[Turning to negotiation and dialogue, two Arctic examples are relevant
for consideration in other parts of the Indigenous world.]{.underline}**
Readers may want to turn their attention to the long history of
redefining Indigenous--state relations to the still-developing
conditions for the exercise of the right of self-determination of
Greenlandic Inuit.

[The Greenland Home Rule Act of 29 November 1978 is probably one of the
best examples of constructive framework legislation accommodating the
rights and aspirations of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The former
Greenland Home Rule Government, or Landsstyret, whose ministers are
elected by the Parliament of Greenland, was given extensive authority,
including veto power over development activities. Since 1978, dialogue
and Indigenous-defined agenda setting has contributed to amendments to
the original Act and the design and architecture for the eventual
independence of Greenland through the exercise of their right of
self-determination.

[Although statehood remains a future objective, it is extraordinary that
peaceful dialogue and negotiation with Inuit within the Danish realm has
yielded authority over both domestic and international portfolios that
will contribute to independence--- from ownership and control of lands,
territories and resources to a determining voice in all domestic
affairs, from education to media to municipal governments **to a
significant role in the renegotiation of United States military bases on
Inuit territory.**]{.underline} **[And all of this has been done in the
context of peaceful negotiation and dialogue, in stark contrast to the
armed conflicts typically associated with threats to the territorial
integrity of a nation-state.]{.underline}**

In 2017, in response to one of the TRC's calls to action, the Government
of Canada put in place 'permanent bilateral mechanisms' to identify
'joint priorities, co-develop policy and monitor progress' (Memorandum
of Understanding, 2017). This commitment resulted in the creation of the
Memorandum of Understanding between Canada and the Assembly of First
Nations (2017), Inuit--Crown Partnership Agreement (2017) and
Canada--Métis Nation Accord (2017).

For Inuit, this permanent bilateral mechanism3 ensures that leadership
from all four comprehensive land claim agreement regions and the
national Inuit organisation have the opportunity for high-level
discussions about their priority issues and potential solutions directly
with the prime minister and their cabinet. These meetings occur on a
regular basis and, thus far, have resulted in substantive responses to
issues and financial needs to ensure the fulfilment of the Government of
Canada's fiduciary obligations to the Inuit as a people. Natan Obed,
President of the national organisation Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has
stated: The Inuit--Crown Partnership Committee will play an important
role as we act on the priorities that matter to Inuit and Canadians.
This committee will enhance cooperation between Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami
and the federal government, allowing us to continue renewing the
relationship between Inuit and the Crown in a sustainable and positive
way. (As quoted in Office of the Prime Minister of Canada, 2017, n.p.)

[Further, the Inuit--Crown Partnership Agreement is complimented by a
significant policy intended 'to promote prosperity and support community
and individual wellbeing throughout Inuit Nunangat', consistent with
'respect and support for Inuit self-determination'.]{.underline} The
Inuit Nunangat Policy (2022) attaches to 'all federal departments and
agencies', explicitly providing clear directives on both policy and
funding of concern to Inuit, their communities and their diverse needs.
Comprehensive in nature, in addition to recognition of and respect for
Inuit self-determination, [the policy addresses Inuit approaches in
relation to priorities and inclusion in decision-making, equity, Inuit
language, research, procurement and a process for evaluation of policy
effectiveness.]{.underline} Ultimately, future outcomes should reflect
genuine equity in the status and conditions of social, economic,
cultural and political realms for Inuit throughout Canada.

LEGISLATION

[A 2021 visit to the United States 'govtrack' website revealed 29
current pieces of legislation in support of Native Americans' and Alaska
Native Tribes' collective or individual tribal concerns, ranging from
the Western Tribal Water Infrastructure Act of 2021 to the Urban Indian
Health Parity Act]{.underline}. 4 Legislation is a common pathway for
government policy to be realised but rarely includes the need for
evaluation of whether such policy actions are effective.

Although the governments of the Philippines (Indigenous Peoples Rights
Act 1997) and Cameroon (see, e.g., UN Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination \[CERD\], 2019; Office of the UN Human Rights
Commissioner, 2022) have enacted legislation and constitutional measures
to acknowledge the specific conditions of Indigenous peoples, both
remain suspect in lack of active, substantive delivery on their word.
Without question, the enactment of the Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples Act (S.C. 2021, c. 14)5 by the Government of Canada
reflects a serious objective of implementation by a democracy in this
century. [Much detailed work remains to be done to achieve comprehensive
implementation of this new federal law across diverse Indigenous peoples
of Canada, but one concrete example to align domestic law specifically
with Article 36 of the UN Declaration as initiated by Inuit is to amend
Canada's immigration legislation (Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami briefing note,
2022).]{.underline} Other concrete developments include responses to the
International Decade of Indigenous Languages, a National Council for
Reconciliation, and the establishment of the National Centre for Truth
and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba.

Desire to Dispossess Indigenous Peoples and Gain Unfettered Access to Indigenous Lands and Resources]{.underline}

In other words, colonialism by settler states is a constant, not a
variable, in both outcome and intent. Further, the state is not only
intentionally colonial, but it is also unified in its desire to co-opt
Indigenous peoples as a method and means of control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

[Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from beneftting, from their ancestral
territories']{.underline}.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not
through outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

[Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over
time]{.underline}. 'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge
and unable to deny it a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance
over the years, 'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people
closer to it'.27 According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous
leaders and 'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood
demands to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to
collaborate in the development of a "solution" that does not challenge
the fundamental imperial lie'.28

[In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism.]{.underline} Drawing
directly from Fanon, Coulthard fnds that colonialism relies on both
objective and subjective elements. The objective components involve
domination through the political, economic and legal structures of the
colonial state. [The subjective elements of colonialism involve the
creation of 'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation
by which colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it]{.underline}.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now
works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping
their perspectives in line with state discourses, rather than merely
excluding them, as in years past. [Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the
reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still
colonial insofar as it remains structurally committed to the
dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and self-determining
authority']{.underline}.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states first
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek
self-[determination. Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded
that states are deliberate and never changing in their
behaviour.]{.underline} **[With this move, Corntassel limits and
actually demeans Indigenous agency, overlooking the reality that
Indigenous organisations themselves chose the human rights framework and
rights discourse as a target sphere of action precisely because, as was
evident in earlier struggles like slavery, civil rights or women's
rights, these were tools available to them that had a proven track
record of opening up new possibilities and shifting previous state
positions and behaviour.]{.underline}** **[Indigenous advocates also
cleverly realised, by the 1970s, that the anti-discrimination and
decolonisation frames could be used together against
states]{.underline}**. [States did, in no way, nefariously impose a
rights framework on Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. **[Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
deliberately chose to frame their self-determination struggles within
the human rights framework in order to bring states into a double bind
where they could not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim
that they uphold equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous
peoples' human rights and leaving them with a diminished and unequal
right of self-determination]{.underline}**. **[But, because he is caught
in the pessimism trap of seeing the state only as unified, deliberate
and unchanging, Corntassel overlooks and diminishes the clear story of
Indigenous agency and the potential for positive change in advancing
self-determination in a multitude of ways.]{.underline}**

Beyond settler colonialism, this [inattention to]{.underline} the
[ideologically mediated character of political epistemology]{.underline}
also [tends to displace]{.underline} other [valuable analytics by
divorcing them from historically grounded accounts of **material
reproduction.**]{.underline} To take only one example,
[Mignolo]{.underline} likewise [treats capitalism as a form of
knowledge]{.underline} that he labels as "economic coloniality," [rather
than the material practices]{.underline} and forms of productive power
that secure the process of "self-valorizing value" (i.e., profit-making
and accumulation) in partthrough colonial conquest. In general,
Mignolo's suggestion here is that racism and patriarchy ought to be
apprehended as ontological-qua-epistemological hierarchies, as opposed
to social practices of defining disposable and exploitable populations
that vary (alongside and with class formation) with social formations or
regimes. [The tendency to posit]{.underline} these [a priori meta-logics
**reduce** what other thinkers have productively theorized as quite
**material structures of colonial and racial capitalism**]{.underline}
(Bhambra, 2021a; BurdenStelly, 2020; Ulas Ince, 2018) to "economic
coloniality" from which one has an "option" to escape the thought
patterns thereof.

5 MIGNOLO'S EPISTEMIC POLITICS

In this section, I further connect these theoretical disagreements to
their political implications. One of the central questions underlying
the MCD project has been an open-ended one about how to refashion
critique in a less Eurocentric key: "What should 'critical theory' be
when the damnés de la terre are brought into the picture" (Mignolo,
2010a, p. 303). I will argue, however, tha[t Mignolo's version of
decolonial thought does not really function as critique with respect
to]{.underline} at least [two desirable criteria for a specific critique
of colonial power relations: (1) the capacity to account for the
**objective** and **subjective** dimensions of the experiences of
domination that colonized actors articulate through struggles over the
terms of social and political relations and (2) the capacity to account
for how beneficiaries of relative power **disavow our/their location in
such relations**]{.underline}, [which is fundamental to
obscuring]{.underline} (and producing via "feedback loops" or recursive
processes) [those oppressive social and political
structures.]{.underline} My claim is that [the historical account and
central analytic of power that is articulated in the
framework]{.underline} of de/coloniality subtly [undercuts
both]{.underline} of these [criteria]{.underline}. Instead, [readers are
left with a project that gives preference to "epistemology" over a
thorough examination of **structural** and **political** settlements and
social forces that constrain and shape the conditions for thought and
action.]{.underline} I refer to Mignolo's tendency to privilege
epistemology in this particular mode as an "epistemic politics."

As to point (1), [Indigenous]{.underline} studies [scholars]{.underline}
engaged in otherwise very different projects such as Simpson (2014),
Byrd (2011), Speed (2017), Coulthard (2014), and Estes (2019) have
nevertheless all [theorized settler colonialism as an ongoing set of
practices premised on an unyielding subjection to land dispossession and
territorial occupation.]{.underline} They all underscore structural
continuity across historically variable strategies of colonization.
[Indigenous scholars and activists]{.underline} also [espouse an
intergenerational political project of resurgence and
resistance]{.underline}, which foregrounds the interpretive and material
task of severing these structurally unbroken links between colonial
past, present, and future. By contrast, [Mignolo]{.underline} flatly
rejects this conception of decolonization. He [dismisses "any act or
project of decolonization" that refers to an "indeterminate domain of
'reality'"]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2011, p. 54). [Such a claim redirects
readers to a critique of colonial categories as **cognitive illusions,**
that is, as pernicious **epistemic inventions.**]{.underline}
**U**ltimately, [the latter formulation misapprehends]{.underline} the
crux of [this relationship between the]{.underline} intergenerational
experience of specific, [material axes of colonial violence and the task
of theorizing (de)colonization]{.underline}. More broadly still, it is
precisely attention to a (intersubjective but no less "real") domain of
reality---which includes the imaginary as a product of social
life---that matters when considering the political stakes of
decolonization. Critical social and political theory is about "resisting
reality," in the words of feminist philosopher Sally Haslanger (2012)[.
Without this kind of orientation to material realities, the valuable
project of remedying deep colonial epistemic injustice]{.underline} (see
Bhambra, 2021b) [becomes highly attenuated]{.underline} from the
sociality and claims-making at issue in mobilization [around
anticolonial demands, such as enforcing Indigenous sovereignty and
treaties and returning stolen land]{.underline} ("land back")

My second criteria, point (2), focuses on the way that those who benefit
from intergenerational projects of colonial
erasure---["settlers"]{.underline}---[are]{.underline} far [more
inclined to disavow those structures by denying the constitutive
structural antagonisms in which we/they are situated.]{.underline}
Mignolo aims to distance epistemological questions from what he casts as
a more conventional sociological way of tracking the reproduction of
power in and through discursively generated knowledge claims. To return
as a case in point to a formulation I have already quoted: "What matters
is not economics, or politics, or history, but knowledge. Better yet,
what matters is history, politics, economics, race, gender, sexuality,
butit is above all the knowledge that is intertwined in all these
practical spheres that entangles us to the point of making us believe
that it is not knowledge that matters but really history, economy,
politics, etc." (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018, p. 135) (my emphasis). Here, I
take it that [Mignolo is arguing that]{.underline} a central obstacle to
remedying colonial epistemic injustice is [an overfocus on patterned
material practices to the point that they are reified as social
reality.]{.underline} The issue with [this]{.underline} claim is that
i[t downplays the real dilemmas faced by differently situated
constituencies,]{.underline} [when they seek to undo their practical
participation in and/or subjection to structures of colonial
violence.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, unlearning certain epistemological
biases comprises part of the latter project---say, for example,
hierarchies that place formalized written histories over oral histories
as valid evidence in juridical forums (Nichols, 2020). Yet, it is the
partially interest-based constitution of differentiated, power-inflected
perceptions of social phenomena that critical theorists assess in
diagnosing why certain pathological knowledge-forms are so difficult to
dislodge and why they are reproduced in time and space. More concretely
stated, [the turn to coloniality as a purely epistemic register of
critique directs significant interpretive attention away from the
crucial fact that settler epistemic and aesthetic disavowal of the
grounds of Indigenous mobilization and critique are part-and-parcel of
settlers' long-term accumulation of material and intergenerational
wealth through removal and displacement.]{.underline}

#### Epistemic alternatives not only obscure exploitation and racial oppression, but also reinforce reactionary academic hierarches that block revolutionary praxis needed to dismantle colonial structures.

DS argues that [the denial of human status (and of being) to the Other
is fundamentally the result of the coloniality of
knowledge.]{.underline} Because [thinking is being]{.underline} (at
least according to the famous Cartesian formula), e[pistemic denial or
erasure amounts to an act of ontological denial]{.underline}. [But DS
theorists do not mean the same thing by 'ontology' as do most
philosophers]{.underline}, i.e. that it is the study of
the nature and possibility of being. [For DS, 'ontology' instead refers
to being *itself*.]{.underline} As the late David Graeber writes in an
essay responding to the anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, whose
'decolonial anthropology' rests on a similar understanding, [theorists
of the epistemic turn 'adopt a tacit ontology which seems
indistinguishable from philosophical idealism]{.underline}'. [Thus,
changing the world, for them, ultimately simply means changing the terms
of the conversation]{.underline}*.* And [while Mignolo
insists]{.underline} that [his de-linking does have a material
dimension, it is never]{.underline} quite [clear where exactly this
materialism appears in his theory.]{.underline}

While DS might sound plausible at first, there is a certain tension
between the emancipatory aims to which it pledges allegiance, the
theoretical framework that it proposes, and its proponents'
positionality in the international (and intellectual) division of
labour[. What are the implications for anti-imperialist struggle in the
global South if those at the forefront of challenging the Eurocentricity
of knowledge production are based in the resource-hoarding universities
of the global North ( especially the US**)? Is there not a danger of
reproducing precisely the kind of epistemic coloniality from which we
are trying to de-link?** And what are we to make of DS' reliance on a
deferential version of standpoint theory, whose narrow focus on
'spokespeople from marginalised groups' could]{.underline}, as Olúfemi
O. Táíwò has argued, [prevent us from bringing those voices into the
centre whose exclusion DS claims to be fighting against?]{.underline}

Táíwò is by no means the only one concerned with the 'elite capture at
scale' enabled by the distorted standpoint theory he calls 'standpoint
deference'. In 'Reflection on the Practices and Discourses of
Decolonisation', a forcefully argued critique of DS, the Bolivian
Anarcho feminist 8

[Using the idea of 'internal colonialism', Casicanqui shows how Mignolo
has built a **'small empire within an empire'**]{.underline} [-- a
formation that perpetuates coloniality in Latin America by 'enthroning'
decolonisation within the academy.]{.underline} [In his unapologetic
appropriation and depoliticisation of the work of radical indigenous
scholarship]{.underline} -- like that of Cusicanqui [-- Mignolo thus
marginalises scholars and activists from the debates that they
themselves started and in which they are still engaged]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} in turn [limits the imaginative power and
emancipatory potential of decolonisation.]{.underline}

[DS]{.underline} [thus reproduces a 'conditional inclusion']{.underline}
-- [a]{.underline} sort of ['second-class citizenship that moulds
subaltern imaginaries and identities into the role of ornaments through
which the anonymous masses play out the theatricality of their own
identity'.]{.underline} [By reducing indigenous peoples to the marginal
status of minorities, 'noble savages' or 'guardians of nature', scholars
like Mignolo and Walsh effectively exclude them from modernity and the
crucial struggles that are waged within it]{.underline}. By contrast,
while Cusicanqui concedes that 'modern history meant slavery for the
indigenous peoples of America', she nonetheless insists that this does
not mean that modernity itself cannot be a site for the articulation of
counterhegemonic indigenous projects of modernity. There remains a
possibility for the creation of what Cusincanqui calls a 'more organic'
modernity -- one that does not create an absolute dichotomy between
modern and indigenous epistemologies, as Mignolo and Walsh often do. 

[On closer inspection, then, DS turns out not to be an emancipatory
discourse at all. In fact, if one is inclined to take any perspective
that holds on to even the smallest commitment to the idea of revolution,
it is openly **reactionary**]{.underline}. In *The End of Cognitive
Empire*, de Sousa Santos goes so far as to proudly proclaim that [the
epistemological turn in DS is a reversal of Marx' famous statement in
Thesis Eleven of the *Theses on Feuerbach*, that philosophers have
interpreted the world,]{.underline} but that the point is to change it. 

[\[Marx'\] thesis would become the cornerstone of Western-centric
critical thinking, claiming the centrality of the concept of praxis as
the synthesis between theory and practice. Almost two hundred years
later, it is imperative that we return to interpretation, to reinterpret
the world before trying to change it. ]{.underline}

Certainly, the relationship between thought and revolutionary action has
long been a concern of Marxist thought -- as, for example in the
post-Althusserian work of Étienne Balibar, Alain Badiou or Jacques
Rancière. But the idealism of DS is, to borrow a phrase from Rancière,
'a philosophy of order', a reactionary theoretical discourse which
affirms the academic hierarchy of intellects and positions while
perpetuating the institution's functioning. The political economy of
knowledge in which DS operates is a far cry from the premise of equal
capacity for thought which animates the post-Althusserian conception of
emancipatory politics as a mass politics. [How exactly DS is supposed to
help us fight state violence, racial oppression, labour exploitation,
military occupation, or imperialism more broadly, remains a
mystery.]{.underline}

There have, of course, been attempts to integrate such considerations
into a DS framework. The decolonial critique that comes out of this
engagement is perhaps best exemplified by Cusicanqui's own research
perspective, which she has described as defying the capitalist global
economy while simultaneously offering a way out of the trappings of
Andean patriarchy. As such, it is a mode of critique that is, as
Macarena Gomez-Barris puts it in The Extractive Zone, 'both rooted
within and disindentified from coloniality and Andean "tradition"'. Such
approaches recognise that indigenous and African-descended peoples in
the Americas are not static representations of an idealised past, as
Mignolo seems to suggest: rather, they are contemporary and active
participants in the remaking of modernity. [The answers to coloniality
aren't to be found in a static form of Otherness or indigeneity. And
even less so when the conception of the Other offered is one which
mimics the essentialist prejudices that DS scholars are, so they claim,
trying to unsettle.]{.underline}

#### This waxes poetic and dooms aff solvency -- a focus on institutional mobilization is key.

**[Liberal individualism is a political framework that places an
extraordinary amount of focus on the political ideas of individual
people in such a way that obscures the]{.underline}** more important
**[emphasis on the people and institutions that make a person's ideas
come to life. No individual person exists in a political
vacuum.]{.underline}** The question of who pays your bills and their
political interest and ideology are important. **[It matters who trained
you. The institutions that stand to benefit from your advocacy
matters.]{.underline}** In fact, all of these things matter more than
your individual ideas and beliefs. **[The problem with liberal
individualism is that it obscures the importance of the development of
the infrastructure necessary to operationalize any idea.]{.underline}**
If, for instance, you are interested in changing the curriculum in the
public school system, it requires more than just a curriculum proposal.
**[If you seriously want to see that change, it requires an
understanding of the mechanics of government that have control over
public education.]{.underline}** **[It would require the ability to
organize large groups of parents and community members to demonstrate
their support by either showing up to a meeting or sending letters. It
would require access to media outlets that can publicize your effort.
You would need to have the money to pay an organizer or a policy
advocate that can navigate the legislative process as well as all the
other work previously mentioned. Without all the things that I just
mentioned, the desire to change the curriculum is nothing more than an
idea that you can wax poetic about.]{.underline}** **[When black
activists obscure the importance of developing the infrastructure to
operationalize their ideas, they tend to revert back to relying on
infrastructure that is owned and controlled by White people which puts
them back in a situation where they have to petition White institutions
in order to operationalize solutions for black people.]{.underline}**
For instance, using the curriculum example, if you were interested in
using existing White institutions that do work on education policy, they
have infrastructure that can be used to mobilize people to show up to
the legislature. They have the capacity and experience to effectively
lobby legislators. They have access to major media outlets. But if you
were advocating a curriculum change that is Afrikan centered and would
rely on an approach to education that offend the White liberal
sensibilities of the people in these organizations, then this
infrastructure is not available to you. **[We should not be in a
situation where we have to navigate the sensibilities of White people in
order to possess the ability to pursue curriculum change that we see as
appropriate.]{.underline}** **[But when we operate from a framework of
individual liberalism, questions of infrastructure are omitted in
service of focusing primarily on ideas. The reason that questions of
infrastructure are often obscured in public conversations about Black
liberation is because it is hard work and not glorious to produce
independent Black infrastructure. It's easier to give speeches or talk
about ideas as opposed to doing the groundwork of developing
infrastructure that is able to effect effectively mobilize people or
being able to create a public relations infrastructure and having to do
all the work it takes to build it. ]{.underline}**

We advance the idea that [it is now time to think beyond the idea of the
territorial state in favour of]{.underline} digitally [connected
archipelagos]{.underline} and shared spaces called ecotones, both of
which require explication. For some, the word \'archipelago\' has a
sinister reputation derived from Solzhenitsyn\'s (1986) description of
the Siberian labour camps as The Gulag Archipelago, where Soviet
political dissidents were disciplined. By contrast, the archipelago we
envision is more wondrous and benign, somewhat like Constellations of
stars. Well, maybe not quite so sublime. Our core idea is derived from
the Caribbean cultural theorist. Edouard [Glissant]{.underline} (1997),
who [entreats us to engage in \'archipelagic thinking\'. For
him]{.underline}, as Bongie (I999: 89) explains. [\'the entire world
is]{.underline} becoming [an archipelago]{.underline} actual
archipelagos such as the Caribbean are exemplary sites for understanding
the complex new relations that ambivalently and chaotically join
together all the hitherto unconnected parts of the world\'. Glissant
calls this process of linking Relation (with a capital R). As Bongie
(2009: 94) elsewhere clarifies - partly citing Glissant - Relation ties,
but does not bind, the self to the other, the excluded to the included.
and the nation to the stranger: That is why [Glissant consistently
refers to an aesthetics]{.underline} or poetics. [as opposed to a
politics, of Relation]{.underline}. [He is adamant that no solution to
the problems of the world will be lasting, or even
beneficial]{.underline} for any length of time, [without being

one that will prompt les humanities to wish to be and to create
themselves as what they are in reality: namely, \'un changement qui ne

of the imaginary\' undermines the normativity of the
nation-state]{.underline}. Instead. archipelagic thinking allows us to
interweave transnational threads and networks, rhizomes and epiphytes,
diasporas and epistemic communities, fans and friends, and nodes and
edges. And, of course. [with]{.underline} the aid of [an archipelagic

connections of [the transnational archipelago that will]{.underline}
make up and continually [refashion our vision for the

#### Turn - They still entrench continental thinking because the plan describes the U.S. as an archipelago

**Bermann 14** Sandra Bermann Princeton University\"Translation as
Relation and Glissant\'s Work.\" CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and
Culture 16.3 (2014): \<https://doi.org/10.7771/1481-4374.2516\> ,

From the beginning, Glissant has written from both a \"local\" and a
\"global\" perspective. A poet and writer of Martinique, he has mapped
his homeland in poetry and prose, describing also the greater arc of the
Caribbean islands. These islands open onto the flux of the sea and its
terrifying history --- as well as its unpredictable changes and unknown
encounters of the future. But the islands and the sea have metaphorical
reach well beyond their local context. In his theoretical writing,
Glissant associates modes of thinking and of history with sorts of
geographical setting. Continental thinking, more systematic, linear, and
interested in filiation and genesis, would tend to be organized and
characterized by \"slow and imperceptible repercussions between
languages\" (Glissant, \"Introduction to a Poetics of the Diverse\"
119). Although this characterizes the European continent and
particularly the Mediterranean basin, it fails to account for many other
cultures of the world interacting today in energetic and sometimes
violent ways. [Opposed to]{.underline} this [continental thinking
Glissant juxtaposes an \"archipelagan\" viewpoint.]{.underline} Such
thought is non-systematic, changeful, open to the unexpected. Like the
islands themselves, set within the restless movement of the sea, this
viewpoint welcomes encounter, innovation, unpredictable change. It also
focuses on a history that is both discontinuous and in many cases,
tragic (Poetics of Relation 33-34, Caribbean Discourse 130-43). From his
Caribbean standpoint, Glissant thus looks backward in time and outward
toward the sea to relate the complicated, non-linear histories of the
island of Martinique. What he describes is not the official French
history of discovery, but the complex interwoven histories of the
island\'s settling, the eradication of its indigenous population, the
development of the slave trade, and the multiple immigrations that
ensued. Such a history does not have lines of filiation reaching back to
a single source. It is from the start a mixture. According to Glissant,
such a tragic history must be faced and accepted, in the same way as the
potential for mixture and encounter it now provides. In poetic texts
such as Les Indes (The Indies), Le Sang rivé (Riveted Blood), Le Sel
noir (Black Salt), and Boises (Yokes), Glissant evokes the tragic
history as well as the present beauty and hopes of the islands through a
language that powerfully draws upon the imagery of the natural world.
For Glissant, \"the poetic word is flesh,\" as he writes in Riveted
Blood (Black Salt 32, The Collected Poems 14). From his island home,
poetry comes as a cry more than a celebration, in contact with the sea
of the Middle Passage, and with the memory of all who have suffered.
Trees, birds, the shore- lines stud the sea with an accumulating imagery
that reveals the working and re-workings of history. This poetry uses
innovative prosodic forms, rather than the traditional Alexandrine ---
including the prose poem, and experiments with aphoristic short verse,
to create a poetry open to new intersections, new ways of reading, new
interpretive relations. The poetic word is, above all, a creolized word,
a complex juncture of oral and written language. Such novelty, such
resistance to the systematic and conventional, is appropriate to the
history and promise of the islands, the archipelago. Through imagery,
syntax and rhythmic form, his poetry evokes a thought process he
describes theoretically in his Introduction to a Poetics of the Diverse:
\"Another form of thought is developing, more intuitive, more fragile,
threatened ... This thought I call \"[archipelagic thought,\" a
nonsystematic, inductive thought that explores the unforeseen of the
world]{.underline}-totality and attunes the written to the oral and the
oral to the written. What I see is that today [the continents are being
\"archipelagized]{.underline},\" at least as perceived from the outside.
[The Americas are archipelagizing themselves]{.underline}, are
constituting themselves into regions beyond national borders. And I
believe that this term of \"region\" needs to be given some dignity.
[Europe is archipelagizing]{.underline}. Linguistic regions, [cultural
regions, beyond the barriers of nationhood, are islands --- but open
islands]{.underline}, this being their main condition for survival\"
(119-20). Here, center and periphery give way to extension,
transformation, and encounter. What emerges is not a unity, but a
diverse totality. [Creolization is for Glissant a central
concept]{.underline}. It is language as métissage, (both a cultural and
a linguistic mixing.) Creole language is both a specific local and
historical phenomenon --- and also [organically linked for Glissant to
the cross-cultural phenomenon]{.underline} described as typical of our
times and [of archipelagan thinking]{.underline}. On the local level,
the Creole language is the language used in Martinique and elsewhere. As
such, it [as a language without a unified, single root; it
is]{.underline} not derived from an original African language, but a
[creation born of]{.underline} many --- [the languages of indigenous
peoples, African slaves and European colonists]{.underline}. A language
tied to the land, it is imbued with specific local histories and
community cultures. According to Glissant, cultures and languages must
be preserved. They must be left their dignity and \"opacity,\" to use
one of his favorite terms. He means by this their depth and distinctness
--- although not exclusivity, isolation, or hegemony. [Such
languages]{.underline}, of which there are many in the world, [must
resist universalization into a single language or group of hegemonic
languages]{.underline}. Glissant thus firmly rejects the universalizing
hopes of the Tower of Babel as well as the tragic view of linguistic
plurality described at the beginning of this article. In Glissant\'s
view, \"vast and dizzying possibilities are opening up, transcending
fierce struggles against economic domination. This is not the
pre-apocalyptic dizziness which precedes the fall of the Tower of Babel,
but rather the tremor of creativity confronted with these boundless
possibilities\" (Glissant, \"Beyond Babel\" 562). And I Submit that
authors should write today with the world\'s multiple languages in mind
--- as possibilities to be protected and nurtured (on this, see, e.g.,
Dagnino; Sturm-Trigonakis). Language and Creolization are the subject of
some of Glissant\'s most compelling essays and theoretical works. His
Discours Antillais (Caribbean Discourse) discusses not only the role of
Creole language in the Caribbean, but its complex and problematic
political situation. For it is not simply the inadequacy of either
French or Creole to express Martiniquan culture that poses problems to
writer and ordinary citizen alike; it is also the unequal weight and
importance of the two languages. \"The official language, French, is not
the people\'s language. This is why we, the elite, speak it so
correctly. The language of the people, Creole, is not the language of
the nation\" (Caribbean Discourse 166). Such a situation clearly creates
major political and literary obstacles. According to Glissant, the
writer can respond to this by transcending both languages to create a
new idiom (what he calls langage as opposed to langue). Amalgamating
both oral and written discourse, Glissant produces a distinctive written
idiom that transforms the official French through the Creole language
(see Britton, 141-43). Specifically, he employs Creole words and
syntactical structures that invade and \"foreignize\" his French text.
At the same time, he finds inspiration in the Caribbean arts of painting
and sculpture --- the painting of Wilfredo Lam and Matta as well as the
sculpture of Cardenas --- as he pursues his own poetics. In Glissant\'s
resulting langage --- a translation in its own right --- the Caribbean
landscape often provides images of mutation and Creolization. Throughout
many of Glissant\'s later texts, [Creolization suggests a]{.underline}
far more general, indeed \"[global\" principle]{.underline}, referring
to the increasing contact between cultures of the world. In our current
era the cultures of the world are intersecting more often and becoming
more conscious of one another. They are changing and exchanging across
shocks, wars, but also the advances of consciousness. The idea of
Creolization in this more general context is rhizomatic --- extending
outward to new encounters: \"If we speak of creolized cultures (like
that of the Caribbean for example), it is not to define a self-contained
category which by its very nature would be opposed to other categories
(pure cultures), but to assert that today the infinite vistas of
interrelating are open to the human mind\" (Glissant qtd. in Dash 148).
While based in local histories, Creolization expressed as a global
principle subverts attempts to glorify any single or \"unique\" origin
that a language, nation or group wishes to claim. It highlights
métissage, encounter and synthesis. Creating the new and unforeseen,
Creolization is a cultural expression of unending metamorphosis, a
métissage without limits. Creolization is also the linguistic term for
the \"poetics of relation\" to which Glissant devoted his 1990
theoretical book Poétique de la relation (published in English
translation in 1997). Glissant takes the term \"relation\" in its usual
sense, meaning rapport, connection, the tie associating things --- be
they phenomena, sizes, peoples etc. It suggests the act of telling or
narrating as well. But he also explores it philosophically and
politically. In his essays, \"relation\" remains anti-essentialist and
strongly anti-imperialist. He uses the term to illustrate a way of
thinking that does not attempt appropriation of one element or language
or culture by another, but that underscores only the tie, the
connection, while leaving to each entity its individual thickness, its
\'opacity.\' Only this way, as equals in respect and independence, do
they maintain the opportunity for free dialogue and exchange. Relation
for Glissant is the positive result of what he calls more generally
\"chaos.\" Referring to chaos theory in mathematics, he emphasizes the
unpredictable and the accidental. Here, new sorts of identity ---
\"relation-identities\" or \"rhizome-identities\" --- are formed. Such
identities do not depend on the downward-reaching root, characteristic
of what he names \"root-identity,\" but extend outward, through multiple
branching networks of roots. Such identity is not fixed but shifting and
questioning, changing through the relations with the many particular
Others that constitute it (Poetics of Relation 141-57; see also Deleuze
and Guattari). For Glissant, the modern epoch constitutes a time of
growing dialogue between cultures of different sensibilities and an
increasing awareness of the importance of identity as multiple and
rhizomatic. A keen sense of the world\'s multilingualism is essential to
this conception: \"I write in the presence of all the world\'s languages
... But to write in the presence of all the world\'s languages does not
mean to know all the world\'s languages. It means that in the present
context of multiple literatures and of the relation of poetics with the
chaos--world, I can no longer write in a monolingual manner\"
(\"Introduction,\" A Poetics of the Diverse 119). This is to say, among
other things, that we must leave behind a sense of language or knowledge
that attempts to dominate or comprehend (in the sense of \"grasping\"
that which is Other) and adopt one that is shared. Ideally, this rapport
with Others permits everyone to speak the world in his/her own created
language --- and to act in the world as well. It also demands an ongoing
awareness and respect for the great number of languages and literatures
in our world, many of which are currently being absorbed. Relation is,
then, above all, an encounter of the languages and cultures of the world
as well as a creation of a new sort of identity that arises from an
awareness of this. It is an encounter that is open, unforeseeable and
creative. It entails exchanges --- but has no system at hand to explain
all in advance, only a keen understanding that there are a multitude of
systems, and that they interact in always new and intriguing ways.
According to Glissant, no communities --- certainly not imperialist ones
--- derive legitimacy from a mythological, ontological or genetic order,
but rather from a \"relational\" one --- that is, from their connection
and openness to others. He notes that wandering and encounter have
always been recurrent themes, essential even to the great
\"foundational\" epics: from the Old Testament, to the Iliad, the
Eqyptian Book of the Dead, the Indian Bhagavad-Gita, the Icelandic sagas
and the Chanson de Roland, the Aeneid to the Popul Vuh or the Chilam
Balam of the Native Americans, to the Finnish Kalevala.
(\"Introduction,\" Poetics of the Diverse 120). In the course of such
mythic journeys, different modes of relation, examples of becoming, are
as important as definitions of being. Emphasizing the journeys ---
rather than the foundational moments --- would provide challenging
themes for study, while subverting the root-identities they usually
suggest Glissant does not lavish many words on translation. But he is
clear about its role. He understands translation as relation par
excellence. Why? For one, because in the exchange fostered by
translation, two texts retain their thickness and opacity. Each is
respected and works within its own cultural and linguistic community.
The act of translation provides the connectivity and does so through its
creative \"detour\" into another language, the wanderer\'s journey into
a new language and culture. Translation\'s role is both real and
symbolic, implicating all of the terms so far discussed. It works in a
nonessentialist, relational way: \"The language of the translator
operates like Creolization and like Relation in the world. That is, this
language produces the unforeseeable. Translation is a veritable
operation of Creolization, from now on a new practice of that invaluable
cultural métissage ... Translation inscribes itself in the multiplicity
of our world, Translation is consequently only the most important type
of the new archipelagic thinking. Art of the flight \[\"fugue\"\] from
one language to another, without the first being effaced, without the
second refusing to appear. But also art of the fugue because each
translation accompanies the network of all possible translations of all
languages into all\" (Introduction à un poetique du divers 45; unless
indicated otherwise, all translations are mine). For Glissant, all
languages reach beyond themselves to intersect with other languages and
the cultures from which they emerge. So there is much room for
translation. But translation will always remain only relative, never
scientifically equivalent. It does not want to be. The translator, like
the writer, creates relations by forging a new language (langage) based
on a respect for Otherness, and in dialogue with it. It is a language
whose novelty and future course cannot be foreseen. This is also the
sort of translation that \"translation as relation\" would describe.
Although Glissant\'s work often suggests poetic vision rather than
argument, it nonetheless illuminates what translation as relation might
include. And although clearly utopian, as well as deeply political, its
visions of [archipelagan remapping]{.underline}, of Creolization, of a
new rhizome identity and of creative translation have both practical and
literary appeal. For one, [they underscore the role of imagination in
envisioning the future.]{.underline} They also suggest fruitful
directions for answering the particular questions introduced earlier: 1)
What might we then mean by an ethics of translation? Translation as
relation would operate within an anti-essentialist philosophical
framework. Its ethics would accept the \"opacity\" of the source text,
while not overwhelming it or pretending to fully comprehend and
transparently restate it in an equivalent semantic and syntactic
structure. Aspects of the source text would always remain unspoken in
the new words of translation. Translation as relation would, moreover,
clearly extend to all the languages of the world. It would intend never
to eradicate the source language but rather to draw attention to it and
to its cultural community; 2) What might we mean by \"language\" in a
broad global context? Is there in fact ever \"a language,\" or is
language itself a sort of \"and zone\" where multiple languages
encounter and overlap? As we have seen, Glissant makes language issues
central to his work and presents them in a variety of ways. His
discussions of Creolization underscore the complexity of every language,
while focusing our attention on the particular linguistic métissage of
post-colonial situations. Glissant\'s explanation of language as in fact
multi-linguistic and in constant transformation suggests new ways to
consider the very language of translation. Indeed, it would seem that
just as the poet creates a langage, a special idiom, for her use, so
does the translator. In the creolized zone that Glissant explores, the
two run parallel, each creative, each transforming language through
dialogues with other texts, languages and arts; and 3) Glissant\'s
writing also advances our understanding of world literature and
translation\'s role within it. The emphasis on multilingualism promotes
respectful consideration of the countless works of literature written in
the many languages of the world. Moreover, while world literature risks
being impoverished when reduced to a simple \"tree-like\" archaeology of
texts and their cultural roots, Glissant offers a new direction of epic
analysis. It builds on the wanderings rather than the \"foundational\"
character of world literature\'s epic texts. This brings us back to that
other journey through language, time, and space entailed in the
production, translation and re-translation of texts, classic and
otherwise. Finally, [Glissant\'s very discussions of archipelagan
thinking]{.underline}, with its potential re-mapping according to flows
of languages, translations, literatures, and peoples [rather than
institutionalized geo-political borders, itself offers an important
humanistic counterpoint to ideas of]{.underline} commercial, financial
or military globalization and to legal and [political structures fixed
within the nation-state]{.underline}. They suggest new ways to think
about literary transmission across the globe, perhaps even new ways to
map world literature.

### Block - Progress Possible

#### Ethno-essentialism DA \-- Epistemic alternatives in decolonial theory risk enabling ethno-essentialism, which fuels nationalist appropriation, and weakens solidarity.

In the preceding sections, I have examined [Mignolo's]{.underline}
framework for decoloniality, particularly his emphasis on epistemic
decolonisation, and discussed critiques that focus on its political and
material implications. This section goes further into the troubling
potential of his [notion of delinking from the West --]{.underline} a
concept which, while intended to challenge Eurocentric frameworks, also
[appeals to certain forms of **right-wing nationalism** that manipulate
its principles for exclusionary agendas]{.underline}. [The appeal lies
in Mignolo's conceptualisation of delinking as a severance from Western
modes of thought, which right-wing nationalist movements interpret as
legitimising their own calls for a 'return' to selectively idealised,
often ethno-nationalist, traditions.]{.underline}

This selective adoption of decolonial concepts underscores an important
critique: [when severance from the West is framed as an absolute goal,
it risks reinforcing exclusivist ideologies that reject global
solidarity and ignore historical interdependencies]{.underline} (Hull
2021). By situating knowledge production outside of an interconnected
historical context[, Mignolo's framework can unintentionally reinforce
nationalist appropriations that reject valuable cross-cultural
influences in favour of insular ideologies.]{.underline} [This
highlights the need for more **nuanced** approaches on
decolonisation]{.underline} in education that address epistemic critique
alongside careful consideration of diverse political landscapes and the
ethical imperatives they raise. My analysis begins with Hull's (2021,
2022) critique of decolonial theory, particularly his examination of
what he terms 'epistemic ethno-nationalism', which he associates with
Mignolo and other decolonial thinkers. Hull's argument focuses on [the
metaphysical interpretation of colonial difference]{.underline} that
[underpins this form of nationalism within decolonial
thought.]{.underline} By revisiting this critique, I aim to explore the
political implications of this perspective for understanding
decoloniality. According to Hull,

[Epistemic ethnonationalism denies that there are universal epistemic
standards by which the truth, coherence or well-foundedness of beliefs
can be assessed]{.underline} . . . \[E\]pistemic ethnonationalism
associates with each 'ethnos' or 'ethnie' a set of beliefs, concepts or
theoretical frames proper to it, such that a member of E1 who embraces
concepts, theories or methods proper to E2, E3 or E4 ipso facto reveals
themselves to be at best confused or brainwashed, at worst a
collaborator or fifth-columnist[. Epistemic
ethnonationalism]{.underline} therefore [denies that achieving advances
in knowledge and in ethical and political values can be a shared global
endeavour.]{.underline} Instead, it insists that each ethnos/-ie must
develop its own truth or knowledge, its own values. (Hull 2022, 135,
original emphasis)

In his analysis, Hull raises important concerns regarding the
intersection of far-right critiques of the 'oppressive' West, as
exemplified by the neo-Traditionalism emerging in Russia, and the
[epistemic decolonisation]{.underline} critique of Western hegemony that
[is grounded in epistemic ethnonationalism.]{.underline} According to
Hull (2022), there are notable similarities between these theoretical
frameworks that pose significant challenges for anticolonial struggles.
By identifying these convergences, Hull highlights the potential risks
of [aligning decoloniality too closely with ethnonationalist and
authoritarian discours]{.underline}es that [may]{.underline} ultimately
[undermine]{.underline} the [broader goals of liberation and
justice.]{.underline} Hull's critique serves as a crucial reminder of
the complexities and nuances inherent in contemporary decolonial
discourse, urging scholars to critically examine the implications of
their theoretical positions.

For example, let us return to Mignolo, who writes the following about
race and gender:

Race and gender are two concepts of Western modernity that make us
believe they 'represent' something that exists. Behind race there is an
implied logic of classification (the logic of coloniality) assuming that
people belong to different races and the markers are blood and skin
colour. Behind gender there is an implied logic of classification
assuming that there are women and men. The classifications shape and
guide our perception of society. However, decolonial gnoseological
assumptions say that names and classifications do not refer to what
there is but frame what we perceive (Mignolo 2021, 85).

As Hull (2022) explains[, Mignolo]{.underline}'s argument extends beyond
a straightforward rejection of traditional categories of race and
gender. He [asserts that all concepts ultimately fail to genuinely
reflect the commonalities and differences present in the real
world.]{.underline} Unlike critiques based solely on biological
evidence, [Mignolo's approach is metaphysical, arguing that concepts are
incapable of accurately referencing objective realit]{.underline}y (Hull
2022). He contends that beliefs can only be deemed valid within specific
cultural or geographical contexts -- essentially, they are valid for
'Westerners' or others within particular group identities (Mignolo 2011;
Mignolo and Walsh 2018). By condemning the 'universalising' tendencies
of Western thought, [Mignolo firmly rejects any notion of convergence
with 'Western' epistemologies]{.underline}, advocating instead for a
focus on localism (Hull 2022).

In particular, [Hull]{.underline} (2022) [suggests]{.underline} that
[neo-Traditionalism]{.underline} (e.g. Dugin's Eurasianism in Russia)
[and decolonial theory]{.underline}, though originating from different
convictions -- one aiming to revive a timeless Tradition and the other
to expose and halt exploitation and oppression -- [arrive at similar
positions.]{.underline} Both frameworks assert that each cultural group
has its own unique values and knowledge systems that are valid only
within that group; this assertion appears respectful of cultural
diversity but risks enforcing conformity to predetermined cultural
values on individuals within those groups, regardless of their personal
beliefs. Hull further argues that [both neo-Traditionalism and
decoloniality reject the idea of objective, universal truth, holding
instead that truth is only valid relative to specific cultural or
evaluative frameworks.]{.underline} Both neo-Traditionalism and
decoloniality criticise 'the West' for centuries of economic
exploitation and the imposition of Western beliefs, values, and rational
standards onto non-Western societies. [Both argue that the dominance of
Western knowledge systems has convinced some non-Western groups to view
these frameworks as universally valid]{.underline}, thus the proper
response is 'epistemic disobedience' to challenge this enduring
coloniality (Hull 2022).

#### Epistemological Decolonization is a dead end. It repeats Mignolo's mistakes, ignores real struggles like land return and sovereignty, and misrepresents political aims of anti-colonial movements.

In summary[, Mignolo's prioritisation of epistemic decolonisation calls
for a structural transformation of how knowledge is recognised and
valued. By advocating for delinking and promoting pluriversality, he
challenges the Eurocentric dominance of knowledge systems and suggests
that true decoloniality must prioritise diverse epistemic frameworks
rather than political or material aims. Mignolo's]{.underline}
decolonial [framework draws a]{.underline} stark [epistemic]{.underline}
and [cultural divide between the West and the non-West]{.underline},
[establishing]{.underline} a binary that presumes [a fundamental
incompatibility between Western and non-Western frameworks of knowledge
and politics]{.underline} (Harruch 2024; Temin 2024). [By framing
decolonial theory as a necessary break or delinking from the dominance
of Western epistemology]{.underline}, Mignolo suggests that societies in
the Global South require unique theoretical approaches that
authentically reflect their histories, cultures, and experiences of
colonialism. This perspective implies that theories originating in the
West inherently fail to serve emancipatory aims in non-Western contexts,
thus privileging localised, alternative frameworks as essential for
decolonial work.

Critiques of Mignolo's decolonial framework

In this section, I aim to analyse critiques of Mignolo's decolonial
framework by identifying three primary pitfalls. [First, Mignolo's
essentialist conception of modernity and the West oversimplifies Western
epistemologies while romanticising non-Western
perspectives.]{.underline} Critics argue that this binary approach risks
caricaturing the West as a homogenous entity responsible for all
colonial structures, while idealising the Global South as the primary
site of resistance and 'authentic' knowledge production, an approach
that can reinforce stereotypes and ignore diversity within each region[.
Second, Mignolo's emphasis on epistemological decolonisation -- which
prioritises the delinking of knowledge systems from 'the West' -- often
overlooks the material and political dimensions of anticolonial
struggles, which traditionally focus on tangible outcomes such as land
reclamation, political representation, and economic justice. This
emphasis on epistemology]{.underline} at times [misidentifies
or]{.underline} even [sidelines the core objectives of anticolonial
thought and politics, which frequently emphasise political liberation
alongside cognitive liberation. Finally, Mignolo's framework has been
critiqued for failing to sufficiently historicise colonial practices and
to account for the specific needs and goals of Indigenous scholars, who
often call for a recognition of their political (e.g. sovereignty) and
material]{.underline} (e.g. land return) [aims over purely epistemic
concerns.]{.underline} Critics suggest that decolonisation should be
grounded in both the historical realities of colonialism and the lived
experiences of Indigenous and marginalised communities, which cannot be
fully addressed by focusing on knowledge production alone. Each of these
critiques is further discussed below.

One of the central criticisms of [Mignolo's]{.underline} approach to
modernity and the West lies in [his portrayal of Western epistemologies
as a singular, monolithic force]{.underline}, which he considers
inherently complicit in colonial domination[. By consolidating a wide
range of ideological traditions -- e.g. conservatism, Christianity,
liberalism, socialism, and even Enlightenment thought -- into a single
tradition and concept]{.underline} assumed to be Western or modern[,
Mignolo overlooks significant distinctions between these traditions and
their complex internal debates]{.underline} (Harruch 2024). For example,
while elements of liberalism have indeed been used to justify colonial
expansion, others have provided a foundation for civil rights movements
and anti-colonial arguments (Vázquez-Arroyo 2018). Similarly, Marxism
has played a significant role in anti-colonial and liberation struggles,
yet it is also criticised by Mignolo as part of the Western colonial
project (Temin 2024). This unvarying treatment of Western ideologies as
uniformly oppressive 6 M. ZEMBYLAS simplifies the reality of Western
intellectual traditions, ignoring the historical and political tensions
that have, in many cases, fostered resistance against colonial powers
rather than compliance with them.

Moreover, by romanticising non-Western perspectives, Mignolo's framework
risks reinforcing an essentialist view of the Global South, implying
that these societies inherently possess more 'authentic' and liberating
epistemologies (Moosavi 2020; Temin 2024). This framing creates an
idealised dichotomy between the West and non-West, attributing a purity
or innocence to the latter that is historically inaccurate and
politically limiting (Vickers 2020). This binary can obscure the roles
that complex social movements and diverse political ideologies from
within both Western and nonWestern contexts have played in resisting
colonial structures (Harruch 2024). This binary also fails, according to
Harruch, to acknowledge that the Global South has been shaped not only
by resistance to colonialism but also by internal social conflicts and
power dynamics that cannot be explained through a purely anti-Western
lens. Thus, critics argue that [Mignolo's emphasis on the West as the
ultimate locus of coloniality risks perpetuating an uncritical
valorisation of nonWestern epistemologies, rather than fostering a
nuanced understanding of global power dynamics and emancipatory
potential across contexts]{.underline} (Temin 2024).

Another criticism of [Mignolo's]{.underline} framework is that [his
emphasis on epistemological decolonisation often overlooks the material
and political dimensions of anticolonial struggles.]{.underline} As
Temin (2024) writes, 'Mignolo (mis)identifies political decolonisation
exclusively with limited struggles for the political form of national
independence' (5). [In other words, Mignolo critiques anticolonial
struggles for national liberation as having an overly limited conception
of transformation, one focused mainly on the replacement of colonial
rule with native rule by seising control over state
institutions.]{.underline} He suggests that these movements primarily
aim to transfer political power within existing frameworks of state
authority, rather than challenging or dismantling the underlying
structures of coloniality. By framing anticolonialism in this way,
[Mignolo suggests that such struggles often fail to achieve deeper,
epistemic decolonisation,]{.underline} as they continue to rely on
inherited Western notions of statehood, governance, and authority (Temin
2024).

However, as Temin argues, [this perspective is limited, because it fails
to take seriously the complex histories of anticolonialism(s), hence
Mignolo's depiction of 'decolonisation as a narrowly political, entirely
top-down, uncritically Eurocentric,]{.underline} and
modernisation-oriented political telos \[...\] is unpersuasive' (2024,
5). Temin points out further that 'Mignolo's portrayal of the narrow
horizons of anticolonial movements disavows their complexity, conceptual
innovation, and their popular, worldmaking, and critically attuned
dimensions' (2024, 6). [Mignolo's focus on 'the epistemic' diminishes
the contributions of key anticolonial thinkers like Fanon and Césaire,
who view anticolonialism as both an intellectual and political project
that unites diverse practices and experiences of resistance against
colonialism and imperialism worldwide]{.underline} (Zembylas 2024). By
emphasising epistemic decolonisation, Mignolo shifts attention away from
the multifaceted efforts of these thinkers, which involve not only
critique but also concrete, collective action against colonial
structures[. This approach risks sidelining the anticolonial legacies
that have sought to transform oppressive political and social
realities]{.underline} in ways that directly confront imperial power
dynamics across various global contexts.

Finally[, Mignolo's framework has been]{.underline} critiqued [for
insufficiently contextualising colonial practices within their specific
historical timelines and for not adequately addressing the distinct
needs and aims of Indigenous scholars]{.underline} (Temin 2024[). Many
Indigenous scholars]{.underline} (e.g. Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2014;
Tuck and Yang 2012; Wolfe 2006[) emphasise the importance of
acknowledging local cultural and political practices as well as land
rights, which often require tangible political solutions beyond
Mignolo's largely epistemic focus.]{.underline} Critics argue that by
centering the decolonisation of knowledge, [Mignolo's approach risks
overlooking]{.underline} these [concrete priorities that are essential
to Indigenous movements and their visions of self-determination and
sovereignty.]{.underline} In particular, Temin (2024) makes two
important claims regarding Mignolo's approach to colonial power
structures. First, [Temin argues that Mignolo misinterprets forms of
colonial domination that are more accurately understood through
frameworks like settler colonialism and indigeneity, which focus on
ongoing territorial occupation and cultural erasure.]{.underline} Hence,
Temin suggests[, it is misleading to treat these interconnected material
and ideological practices as merely elements or outcomes of the
'coloniality of knowledge'.]{.underline} Second, Mignolo's emphasis on
epistemic decolonisation, rather than a historically situated analysis
of power relations, overlooks how epistemology itself is shaped by
material and ideological power structures (Temin 2024). This lack of
focus on material power relations limits the framework's ability to
fully address the role of colonialism in shaping societal structures and
ideologies. As Temin summarises the political implications of Mignolo's
framework:

**[\[T\]he turn to coloniality as a purely epistemic register of
critique directs significant interpretive attention away from the
crucial fact that settler epistemic and aesthetic disavowal of the
grounds of Indigenous mobilisation and critique are part-and-parcel of
settlers' long-term accumulation of material and intergenerational
wealth through removal and displacement]{.underline}**. (2024, 9)

One potent rubric that draws together these various lines of revision is
**[a shared interest in diagnosing the Eurocentric character of the
field and offering remedies for its overcoming]{.underline}**. This
**[arguably is the most prominent way of articulating what it means to
decolonize political theory. This critical move]{.underline}** is
salutary and compelling, and it **[has initiated probing discussions of
the limitations, blind spots, and exclusions of the purportedly
universal theories, categories, and narratives of Western political
thought. It has motivated calls for more inclusion and recognition of
non-European thought, and generated important political and
philosophical debates about how to chart and address the ongoing
legacies of empire and racial domination today]{.underline}**. **[At the
same time, we worry that the overriding concern with Eurocentrism is
indicative of a problem, a persistent limit of these approaches, namely
that they tend to focus on Western political thought as the sole object
of critique and analysis.]{.underline}**

Such a strategy of internal critique is perhaps understandable in
scholarship on empire and political theory, which has focused on
recontextualizing canonical debates and thinkers by elucidating the
imperial context of the formation and foundation of modern political
thought. But the dominance of this framing is also apparent in studies
of non-Western thinkers. **[When anticolonial and postcolonial thinkers
are incorporated and engaged with, their political and theoretical
insights are very often reduced to the critique of European political
thought and practices. In the process we lose track of what arguably was
the primary context and aspiration of anticolonial argument: an attempt
to reconstruct viable political futures in the aftermath of European
domination. Likewise, even as postcolonial theory's critique of European
thought has come to be more generously cited, the alternative concepts
it proposes for the study of postcolonial politics are rarely taken
up.]{.underline}**

**[While the critique of Eurocentrism is noteworthy and important, it
should not exhaust what it means to decolonize political theory. Our
hope is to advance and pluralize the project of decolonizing political
theory by suggesting ways of generating political theory from and for
the non-European world, that is, by imagining political theory of a
truly global reach. To do so, we begin by returning to some key themes
of anticolonial thought to remind us of some of its theoretical projects
and purposes]{.underline}**. Our contention is that **[there is much to
learn from its methods and arguments to aid the project of decolonizing
theory and, in turn, to offer a path toward the rejuvenation of
political theory writ large. We also hope to correct the onesided
reception of anticolonialism as simply a critique of the
West]{.underline}**. **[Indeed it might be useful to think of
anticolonial thought as having two connected aims---one critical and
another reconstructive]{.underline}**. To highlight these aims across
dif­fering political projects, we read together two classic, if often
opposed, figures, Gandhi and Fanon. **[Much of the critical work of
anticolonialism was]{.underline}**, indeed, **[imbricated in revealing
the false, compromised, or corrupted universalisms of Western
civilization and the hypocrisy of its self-understanding as the beacon
of enlightened humanism.]{.underline}** The record of colonial violence,
exploitation, and domination revealed the limits and fragilities of the
West's commitment to freedom and, especially, its capacity to be the
agent of its universal realizability. **[But it is worth remembering
that this critical project, exposing the complicity of Western
universalism with violence, was not just an argument with and for the
West.]{.underline}** As is the case with Gandhi and Fanon, very often it
was an argument with and for their colonized compatriots; it was a mode
of self-critique meant to diagnose and break the collective enthrallment
with the West.

**[As the field of political theory begins to engage more routinely with
anticolonial thought,]{.underline}** **[we should remember the
importance of the specific context or problemspace of anticolonial
argument, a context that shapes and clarifies the nature and purpose of
its theoretical interventions.6 The attunement to context is all too
rare; more often, the critical insights of anticolonialism are
registered as abstract and isolated conclusions.]{.underline}** But the
structure, location, and audience of critique matters. **[For instance,
the anticolonial critique of Eurocentrism concerned decolonizing the
mind; its aim was to undo the ingrained moral psychology and habituated
practices of colonialism through which the colonized reproduced their
own subordination]{.underline}**. Moreover, this critical gesture was
meant to clear the ground and make possible a reconstructive argument.
This was to make possible an alternative universal, whether that
normative ideal was characterized as a truer humanism, a more liberatory
politics, or forms of freedom that did not require the domination of
others. **[What is also distinctively anticolonial in this form of
utopian politics was its situated method]{.underline}**. Anticolonial
thinkers tried to pinpoint the cultural and institutional
sites---immanent to the experience of the colonized---that could
generate new emancipatory futures. Crucially, this was simultaneously an
analytic and normative endeavor.

After delineating what we take to be the distinctive features of
anticolonialism as a genre of political theory, we contrast this to the
ways in which these insights have been taken up in contemporary
political theory. Here we focus on some of the prominent ways critical
theory has tried to address the philosophical challenges of
Eurocentrism. We explore the seminal contributions of Susan BuckMorss,
Amy Allen, and James Tully in this regard, and consider how they reckon
with the problem of empire as they offer new models of universality. We
argue that **[these attempts, while salutary, remain either too abstract
or too self-referential; they often try to correct the problem within
the terms of Western political thought itself. Decolonizing becomes a
form of intellectual self-critique and self-cleansing, which seems to
proceed at some distance from concrete sites of political praxis,
especially sites beyond the West.]{.underline}**

#### Trump has solidified a capitalist oligarchy that results in [endless war.]{.underline}

**WSWS 25** \-- The World Socialist Web Site Is the online publication
of the world Trotskyist movement, the International Committee of the
Fourth International, and its affiliated sections in the Socialist
Equality Parties around the world. "American degradation: Trump returns
to the White House", 19 January 2025,
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/01/20/uirp-j20.html) ree

Today, the most degraded event in modern American political history is
taking place. [A convicted criminal, con man and pathological liar, a
fascist demagogue in whom ignorance and bigotry vie for control with
greed and vanity,]{.underline} will become "[commander-in-chief" of the
world's most powerful military, armed with enough nuclear weapons to
incinerate all life on the planet.]{.underline}

[Nothing marks so clearly the irredeemable collapse of American
democracy as the return of Donald Trump to the White House, four years
after attempting to overthrow the last election by force]{.underline}
and install himself as president-dictator despite his overwhelming
defeat at the polls. Trump will be inaugurated as the 47th president of
the United States, not by means of a coup d'état, as he sought to carry
out on January 6, 2021[, but thanks to his support in the financial
oligarchy that rules]{.underline} America, along with the prostration
[and bankruptcy of]{.underline} his nominal opponents in [the Democratic
Party]{.underline}.

In March 2003, [at the onset of the US invasion of Iraq,]{.underline}
the World Socialist Web Site wrote that American [imperialism, despite
its vast military apparatus, had embarked on a course that would lead to
a "rendezvous with disaster."]{.underline} It is now possible to give a
date for that rendezvous: January 20, 2025. 

[Karl Marx famously declared that history repeats itself, the first time
as tragedy, the second time as farce.]{.underline} In the [second
inauguration of Donald Trump]{.underline}, this aphorism could be
modified: the first time as farce, the [second time as
catastrophe]{.underline}. In elevating Trump for a second time to the
presidency, the American ruling class has forfeited all political and
moral credibility. It is the beginning of the end for American
capitalism. It has sown the wind, and will now reap the whirlwind.

In 2017, it could have been said---albeit wrongly---that the entry of
Trump into the White House was an aberration, a political accident, or
merely the byproduct of Democratic Party incompetence and arrogance. No
such claim can be made about the repetition of that event eight years
later. [It is now clear that Trump represents the quintessence of the
American ruling class.]{.underline} His personal characteristics are a
[hideous expression of]{.underline} the main features of [the oligarchy
of billionaires whose wealth and power have swelled to unprecedented
dimensions over the past four decades.]{.underline}

When Trump was first sworn in as president, on January 20, 2017, the
Socialist Equality Party (US) issued a statement headlined, "The
inauguration of Donald Trump: An event that will live in infamy." This
is what we wrote eight years ago:

The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president is among the most
ignominious events in the history of the United States. [More than \$100
million is being spent on the celebrations of the new president's
installation. In vain! No amount of money can dispel the nauseating
stink that pervades every aspect of this inauguration.]{.underline} Nor
can the fraudulent orchestration of public festivities conceal the
widespread sense that the country, with the installation of the new
administration, has embarked on a path that will lead to a disaster of
unimaginable dimensions.

History has caught up with American capitalism. The protracted process
of economic and social decay has been covered over for decades with
democratic phrases that served to disguise the gap between the official
political myths and the underlying reality. But the mask has now come
off. [Donald Trump personifies the corruption, ruthlessness, parasitism
and essentially fascistic mindset of the capitalist oligarchs who
control the United States.]{.underline} **[Trump will lead a government
of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. ]{.underline}**

The SEP noted the sharp divisions within the US ruling elite, primarily
over **[foreign policy,]{.underline}** and [**whether US preparations
for economic and military warfare** should be **directed** first
**towards Russia, or China, or against its European imperialist rivals**
like Germany. **We warned:**]{.underline}

However bitter the disputes, all sections of the ruling class are united
in their conviction that **[1)]{.underline}** American **[imperialism
must pursue its global interests even at the risk of war;]{.underline}**
and **[2) the attack on the social interests and political rights of the
working class must be intensified]{.underline}**. That
**[Trump]{.underline}** speaks and **[tweets]{.underline}** not only for
himself but **[on behalf of the ruling class is proven by]{.underline}**
the fact that **[his cabinet selections of billionaires and generals are
sailing through the Senate confirmation proceedings with negligible
opposition.]{.underline}** As for Obama, he devoted his final press
conference Wednesday to vouching for the political legitimacy of the
incoming administration and declaring that, having won, "it is
appropriate for \[Trump\] to go forward with his visions and his
values."

Not only was this assessment vindicated by events; it applies to the
political situation today, only exponentially. [The outgoing President
Joe Biden personifies the decrepit state of the Democratic Party and
American liberalism. Despite acknowledging]{.underline}, briefly, that
[Trump is a fascist, he has pledged the "smoothest transition"
possible]{.underline}. And indeed, much of Trump's fascist program will
only extend and intensify the measures already undertaken by the
Biden-Harris administration: [mass deportations of immigrants; attacks
on democratic rights, particularly against those who oppose the policies
of]{.underline} American [**imperialism at home or abroad; economic
warfare, political subversion and outright military aggression against
countries** targeted by Washington.]{.underline}

As the SEP declared eight years ago, **[the alternative to Trump will
come only from the]{.underline}** American and international **[working
class.]{.underline}** The record of the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [is an unanswerable confirmation of this
assessment.]{.underline} History will condemn his four years in the
White House in much the same way as it has judged Germany's Weimar
regime: as an interlude during which the fascist forces were allowed to
overcome their initial failures and reemerge as an even greater danger
to the democratic and social rights of working people, both in America
and around the world.

Moreover, with its focus on the [escalation]{.underline} of the [US-NATO
war against Russia in Ukraine,]{.underline} its unshakeable commitment
[to enabling Israeli genocide in Gaza]{.underline}, and its
[preparations]{.underline} for e[ven wider wars against Iran and
ultimately China,]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration
has already [begun the first stages of a world war]{.underline} which it
[now hands off to the crazed militarists of the Trump
administration,]{.underline} including figures such as the advocate and
defender of war crimes Pete Hegseth, nominated to head the Pentagon.

There are many others who share responsibility for the resurrection of
Trump. The socioeconomic processes that have given rise to the
billionaire oligarchy operate not just through individuals, but through
institutions like the corporate media and the political organizations of
the affluent middle class, including the pseudo-left.

#### Political action without a proper [telos]{.underline} will get crushed by the Trump administration -- mass organizing is the only way out.

The new year on the Gregorian calendar has just begun, and many can feel
a building crescendo of new, old and further abuses from the ruling
class. Some on **[the left are approaching 2025 with trepidation due to
Project 2025]{.underline}**, a manifesto by the Heritage Foundation for
the returning Trump administration. **[Project 2025 is a racist,
misogynistic, transphobic and anti-worker agenda that promises mass
arrests of immigrant and transgender workers. With intentions of
intensifying legal harassment and repression against the entire left, it
also promises to increase the militancy of the ruling
classes.]{.underline}**

 **[Militant demonstration against Trump, Los Angeles, Nov.
2024.]{.underline}**

**[It's not president-elect Donald Trump alone, but rather the ruling
class]{.underline}** as represented by the entire U.S. political
apparatus, which **[has brought us to this point of reaction to
working-class expressions of power.]{.underline}**

**[After the George Floyd uprising in 2020, the bourgeoisie was reminded
of its own vulnerability in the face of millions of workers and
oppressed people united.]{.underline}** This reminder **[grew more
intense as the new wave of powerful labor organizing, from Starbucks
Workers United to the Amazon Labor Union, began to win battles against
seemingly-untouchable giants of capitalism. ]{.underline}**

The U.S. ruling class struck back in many ways. These included further
**[attempts to divide the working class by doubling down on reactionary
racist, transphobic and anti-immigrant talking points]{.underline}**.
Many industries, having already used [pandemic quarantines as an excuse
to unjustly cut jobs, pay and benefits, further doubled down on these
vicious attempts to make workers redundant through the use of AI
tools.]{.underline}

**[Imperialist wars intensify]{.underline}**

The Biden administration not only assisted the **[ruling class in
attacks on U.S. workers time and time again, as with the smashing of the
rail workers' strike in 2022, but also supported --- and continues to
support --- the ongoing imperialist genocide in Gaza]{.underline}** by
shipping exorbitant amounts of arms and material supplies to Israel. 

**[Again we see the pendulum swing over a wider and wider gap between
the capitalist class and the working class, as the last year brought
millions upon millions of people across the globe to speak out against
the genocide and against every single imperialist government that
enables it.]{.underline}**

So once again, **[the ruling classes are scared.]{.underline}** Once
again, they strike back with further repression. With **[further laws
against protests.]{.underline}** With further **[commands for workers to
shut up, know their place, sit down and let thousands of innocents be
slaughtered just to deepen the pockets of defense
contractors.]{.underline}**

What this **[widening gap tells us is clear.]{.underline}** **[The
bourgeoisie is growing more reactionary and dangerous, because it is
reacting to our movements.]{.underline}** **[We are making real progress
in organizing the working class, and the owning classes want to do
everything they can to stop this.]{.underline}** We are making real
progress in **[standing up to exploitation and oppression. We are making
real progress in waking up, after decades asleep, as a class to our
position, to where we have been and where we are going.]{.underline}**

**[And where are we going?]{.underline}**

**[It is up to us.]{.underline}** **[What 2025 means to our class is up
to all of us, to every corner of the movement, every workers' party,
every labor union, every organization for the rights of oppressed
peoples' self-determination.]{.underline}** **[Things look so dire
because we have made the biggest strides in decades and are facing the
biggest pushback in as long. ]{.underline}**

**[When we unite to fight, we win!]{.underline}**

The nature of the contradiction that is [class society is that our enemy
class will counterattack with all its might. Contradiction is inherent
in capitalist society]{.underline}. The bourgeoisie owns the levers of
power, but the **[workers are the power.]{.underline}**  **[Nothing in
society functions without us. We have the real power in our hands, but
we only have it as a class]{.underline}**. We only have it together.

**[Nobody is going to do the work of organizing for us. Nobody is going
to save us. We shouldn't depend on adventurous individuals like Luigi
Mangione to save the day]{.underline}**. **[Random individual acts of
violence will not change the class character of our society, but will
rather provoke a further reaction of repression from the ruling classes
without any structural benefit whatsoever. ]{.underline}**

**[The same is true of unguided, unprincipled political
action]{.underline}**. Without an understanding of political theory of
where our movement comes from, [we are blindly fumbling in the
dark.]{.underline} Again, we will get the reaction of repression without
any benefit.

There has been an excess of modesty in the feminist agendas of recent
decades. Carol A. [Stabile is amongst those who have been critical of an
absence of systemic thinking within postmodern feminisms, remarking upon
a "growing emphasis on fragmentations and single-issue
politics."]{.underline}1 [Stabile dismisses this kind of thinking which,
in "so resolutely avoiding 'totalizing']{.underline}---the bête noire of
contemporary critical theory---\[...\] [ignores or jettisons a
structural analysis of capitalism."]{.underline}2 [The difference in
scope and scale between that which is being opposed and the strategies
being used to oppose it is generative of a sense of
disempowerment.]{.underline} On the one hand, Stabile argues,
[postmodern social theorists "accept the systemic nature of capitalism,
as made visible in its consolidation of power and its global
expansion]{.underline} \[...\] [Capitalism's power as a system is
therefore identified and named as a totality"; on the other hand, these
theorists "celebrate local, fragmented, or partial forms of knowledge as
the only forms of knowledge available" and criticize big-picture
speculative thinking for its potentially oppressive tendencies or
applications.]{.underline}3 Nancy Fraser, too, has addressed this
apparent "shrinking of emancipatory vision at the fin de siècle,"
linking this with "a major shift in the feminist imaginary" during the
1980s and 1990s---that is, with a move away from attempting to remake
political economy (redistribution) and towards an effort at transforming
culture (recognition).4 [The legacies of this kind of political
theorizing]{.underline}---legacies some might describe as "folk
political"---[are still being felt today, and continue to shape the
perceived horizons of possibility for progressive
projects.]{.underline}5 Yet [these projects]{.underline}, which are
frequently valuable, necessary, and effective on their own terms, [are
not sufficient as ends in themselves.]{.underline} To the extent that
they are conceptualized in detachment from an ecology of other
interventions, [operating via a diversity of means and across a variety
of scales, they cannot serve as a suitable basis for any politics
seeking to contest the imaginaries of the right or to contend with the
expansive hegemonic project of neoliberal capitalism.]{.underline} It is
for this reason that Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams's work positions
itself as somewhat skeptical about fragmentations and single-issue
politics, pointing out that problems such as "global exploitation,
planetary climate change, rising surplus populations, \[and\] the
repeated crises of capitalism are abstract in appearance, complex in
structure, and non-localized."6 As such, a [politics based around the
ideas that "the local is ethical, simpler is better, the organic is
healthy, permanence is oppressive, and progress is over" is not always
the best weapon in an attempt to contend with the complex technomaterial
conditions of the world as it stands.]{.underline}7 [There is a
persistent kind of abstraction anxiety hanging over progressive
politics; an anxiety that haunts a contemporary leftist feminism still
unwilling or unable to critically reappraise the tendencies]{.underline}
that Stabile identified in the 90s. Recently, however, [a renewed
appetite for ambitious and future-oriented emancipatory politics has
begun to make itself felt at the fringes of the left---and indeed, to
gather momentum and popular support more broadly]{.underline}.8 Perhaps
[the most remarkable example of this tendency within
philosophically-inflected political theory circles has been
accelerationism, with its calls to build an "intellectual
infrastructure" capable of "creating a new ideology, economic and social
models, and a vision of the good to replace and surpass the emaciated
ideals that rule our world today."]{.underline}9 These so-called
"Promethean" ideas have generated widespread interest, arguably both
reflecting and contributing to the changing tenor of activist discourse.
Interestingly, this term has to some extent emerged in opposition to the
pejorative "folk political," acting as a shorthand for a very different
set of values and perspectives. In a recent critical piece, Alexander
Galloway suggests that "Prometheanism" could be defined as "technology
for humans to overcome natural limit."10 Peter [Wolfendale, meanwhile,
sees it as a "politics of intervention"---one that starts from the
insistence that nothing be exempted in advance from the enactment of
re/visionary processes.]{.underline}11

#### The 1AC advocates for study without an end-goal -- that treats studying as "political" which means state crackdown strategies always win. 

**Ford 17**\
(Derek R. Ford, assistant professor of education studies, Depauw
University. He received his PhD in cultural foundations of education
from Syracuse University. "Studying like a communist: Affect, the Party,
and the educational limits to capitalism" Educational Philosophy and
Theory 49(5))

[Studying is]{.underline}, like the crowd event, a beautiful moment of
encounter, [the opening up of the possible]{.underline}, the breeding
ground of the new. While studying one is disindivuated, swaying between
subjectification and desubjectification, between being this and being
that. The studier resists classification, preferring not to actualize
any predicate. And like the crowd event, I contend, [studying isn't
politics, it is only the occasion for politics, a necessary but
insufficient educational logic for the struggle against capitalist
production relations and for the common. Without something more,
studying can retreat from impotentiality into impotence, and, on the
other hand, **it can be actualized into something
reactionary.**]{.underline} To illustrate these possibilities, I will
turn to two examples. The first example is of studying as hacking, when
one takes some thing or process, enters into and disrupts it. [Hacking
is an intervention that directs something toward other ends and uses,
detaching it from its attachments to other objects and processes,
potentially opening it up to the unforeseen and
unforeseeable.]{.underline} In this way, hacking is a transgression and
the hacker is an outlaw, one who literally lives by transgressing the
lawful order that dictates propriety (who can do what with what). Lewis
and Friedrich (2016) bring up the Anonymous collective, which has
'repurposed websites and servers to expose particular contradictions and
injustices in the capitalist system' (p. 244). Not only their actions,
but [Anonymous' very mode of organization is subversive in that anyone
can join.]{.underline} Membership in the collective is not predicated
upon any particular identity or a commitment to a specific end.
Anonymous are 'pirates who steal back private code for common use, and
in this sense open up the world of code to unanticipated mutations'
(ibid). One of Anonymous' first major actions was a swarm attack on the
Church of Scientology for their efforts to censor online criticism of
the Church. In addition to sending all-black faxes to their fax machines
(to use up ink), Anonymous members coordinated a Google bomb attack by
linking 'scientology' to a host of other words, like 'dangerous' and
'cult,' to influence (redirect) any Google searches for scientology.
Through distributed denial-of-service attacks, in which multiple
computers attack the infrastructure of root nameservers, Anonymous
hackers have shut down a host of websites, from the Department of
Justice (in response to the DoJ's takedown of a file-sharing network) to
the International Association of Chiefs of Police (as part of a national
day of action against police brutality). [While hacking is indeed a
reappropriation of code and a repurposing of the networked
infrastructure of contemporary capitalism, there is nothing inherently
revolutionary about hacking. For as many Anonymous actions that have
supported revolutionary political movements, there have been others that
have arguably hindered such movements.]{.underline} Consider Anonymous'
intervention in the 'Arab Spring' uprisings as a case in point.
Anonymous sought to support the uprisings by attacking government
websites and publicizing the private information of government officials
who were opposing or repressing the protests. Yet in addition to
attacking the governments of Egypt and Tunisia, which were indeed
repressing popular revolts, Anonymous also attacked the government of
Syria, which was battling a range of forces, including those associated
with al-Qaeda and its splinter group, Daesh, or the Islamic State in
Syria. The situation in Syria was much different than in Egypt or
Tunisia, as the government retained popular support and immediately
engaged in a series of serious reforms, including the drafting of an
entirely new constitution (see Glazebrook, 2013). Indeed, it could be
said that in Syria, the government was the progressive force. Or
consider a spin-off of Anonymous, [Ghost Squad]{.underline}, which [shut
down the official website of th]{.underline}e Loyal White Knights of the
[Ku Klux Klan and the next week attacked the website of Black Lives
Matter]{.underline} (before tweeting, 'All lives matter!'). Regardless
of one's position on these issues, conflicts, nation-states, and so on,
it is clear from these few examples that [hacking doesn't have a
politics and that, as an act of studying, it is not inherently against
capitalist production relations.]{.underline} The second example that I
turn to here is meant to illustrate the potential apolitical impotence
of studying, and it brings us more directly into conversation with Dean.
In the last chapter of Lewis' (2013) On Study, he turns to the early
stages of the Occupy Wall Street movement to articulate the
'im-potential political dimension to studying' (p. 150). [Lewis
celebrates the beginning stage of Occupy Wall Street as a form of
collective, public studying, especially in its absence of concrete
demands.]{.underline} While the mainstream press and politicians were
anxious to hear what the protesters were demanding so they could issue a
response accordingly, the occupation 'spent most of its time preferring
not to commit to any one demand over and above any other' (p. 152).
[Rather than actualize political polemics and demands]{.underline},
articulating them into proposals that could then be evaluated, occupiers
produced a rupture within the received order of political struggle. The
[occupation actively resisted the drive to achieve results and instead
conducted an ongoing study of politics, suspending the pursuit of
measureable outcomes; engaging in protest as not protest.]{.underline}
As a result, [efforts to grade Occupy falter, for there were no
pre-established criteria with which to evaluate it.]{.underline} Occupy
celebrated horizontalism, leaderlessness, inclusivity, and the absence
of hierarchical structures. Neither an undifferentiated mass nor an
agglomeration of individuals, the occupiers formed a state of exception
where dichotomies and divisions were left idle, the homeless the middle
class, and a host of other intermediary grounds (including students) met
in an atopic space and time to study the sublime art of discussing
across differences and living across class divisions. What emerged was
precisely the question (and not the answer) of inclusion and exclusion
facing not only OWS but the contemporary learning society as such. (p.
159) This state of exception was exemplified in the slogan, 'We are the
99%!' The 99% was a kind of nonidentity, 'a totally generic yet
absolutely irreducible singularity' (p. 157), as Lewis puts it. 'We are
the 99%!' took a quantity and transformed it into an indefinable
quality, a way of grouping people without resorting to predicates and
already-established identities. Just precisely who the 99% were (or
are), was never fully delineated, couldn't quite be accounted for. The
question was left open for collective study. [A major problem with this
ongoing collective study]{.underline}, however, [is that there was
nothing to defend it or to sustain it. Capital and its state weren't
studying, but were rather gearing up to unleash a wave of repression
that would eventually undo the occupation.]{.underline} The Partnership
for Civil Justice Fund has released several sets of documents obtained
through Freedom of Information Act requests that detail [the dense
network of surveillance and repressive efforts that included offices of
the F]{.underline}ederal [B]{.underline}ureau of
[I]{.underline}nvestigation, the Department of [Homeland Security,
the]{.underline} New York [Stock Exchange, the Federal Reserve,
universities and colleges, major corporations, local police forces, and
local governments,]{.underline} as well as the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms and the US Marshals Service (Partnership for Civil
Justice Fund, 2012, 2016). In this case, [**repression opened the door
to reabsorption**, as many Occupiers entered the non-profit industrial
complex, or even started their own business ventures to profit from
their activism. Occupying and hacking represent study as embryonic
political praxis, the enactment of educational logics that are
potentially antagonistic to capitalist production relations and
capital's logic of learning.]{.underline} Whereas capitalism demands
that everything---even that which opposes it---be actualized so that it
can be subsumed within its circuits of productivity, occupying and
hacking interrupt this seemingly ceaseless process, opening up the world
and subjectivity to the possibility of being otherwise than. [Studying
is therefore]{.underline}, I proffer, [the educational activity of the
crowd]{.underline}, a way to pedagogically bring forth the beautiful
moment. [This is a crucial element of struggle but]{.underline}, as Dean
insists, [it isn't properly a politics; it is merely an opening for
politics.]{.underline} Writing again explicitly about political
movements, Dean (2016) contends: [The beautiful in-between of infinite
potentiality can't last forever. People get tired. Some want a little
predictability, reliable food sources, shelter, and medical care. Others
realize they're doing all the work... The crowd isn't an alternative
political arrangement; it's the opening to a process of
re-arrangement.]{.underline} (p. 142) [The question, then, is how to
seize upon this opening and carry it forward into a real revolutionary
movement.]{.underline} How, in other words, to make the encounter take
hold, how to make it take off in a desirable direction? [These are
questions that, while they should always be open to study, have to be
answered, at least provisionally and contingently. Or else the market
and its advertising agencies will come knocking with an endless list of
glossy, high-definition answers. Or, alternatively, the state will come
knocking down doors, guns drawn and handcuffs aplenty. The encounter
won't take hold and the possibility of the new will be foreclosed as the
crowd is dispersed through redirection, exhaustion, or
repression.]{.underline}

**The alternative is to affirm Communist Party organizing. That requires
formal structures with membership commitments, and militant cadres to
build bases of support for dual power against the state. That's key for
international liberation.**

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing, and that party organizing can allow this
emerging movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that [the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. A century of anticommunist propaganda has been
extremely effective in convincing even the most oppressed and
marginalized that communism has nothing to offer them. [The base
building emphasis on dual power responds directly to this insight. By
building institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to
concretely demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief
from the horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building
strategy recognizes that actually doing the work to serve the people
does infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular support than
electing democratic socialist candidates or holding endless political
education classes can ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that
we have something to offer the oppressed. The question, of course,
remains: once we have built a base of popular support, what do we do
next? [If it turns out that establishing socialist institutions to meet
people's needs does in fact create sympathy towards the cause of
communism, how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply: **[in
order to mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we need
to have already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.underline}** [It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs.
Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in the name of
communism.]{.underline} [We must refuse covert front organizing and
instead have a public face as a communist party.]{.underline} When we
build tenants unions, serve the people programs, and other dual power
projects, we must make it clear that we are organizing as communists,
unified around a party, and are not content simply with establishing
endless dual power organizations. [We must be clear that our strategy is
revolutionary and in order to make this clear we must adopt party
organizing. By "party organizing" I mean an organizational strategy
which adopts the party model. Such organizing focuses on building a
party whose membership is formally unified around a party line
determined by democratic centralist decision making.]{.underline} [The
party model creates internal methods for **holding party members
accountable**, unifying party member action around democratically
determined goals, and for educating party members in communist theory
and praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization utilizing the party
model works to build dual power institutions while simultaneously
educating the communities they hope to serve. [Organizations which adopt
the party model focus on propagandizing around the need for
revolutionary socialism. They function as the forefront of political
organizing, empowering local communities to theorize their liberation
through communist theory while organizing communities to literally fight
for their liberation.]{.underline} A party is not simply a group of
individuals doing work together, but is a formal organization unified in
its fight against capitalism. Party organizing has much to offer the
base building movement. By working in a unified party, base builders can
ensure that local struggles are tied to and informed by a unified
national and international strategy. While the most horrific
manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique form at the
local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is against a
material base which functions not only at the national but at the
international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[party organizing allows for
local organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for
their actions.]{.underline}** [It allows criticism to function not as
one independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather
as comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to
sharpen each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [accountability is crucial.]{.underline} [As a
movement which operates within a settler colonial society, imperialist
and colonial ideal frequently infect leftist organizing. Creating formal
unity and party procedure for dealing with and correcting these ideas
allows us to address these consistent problems within American socialist
organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies the various
dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also allows for
base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into
the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The party model
creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in
a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with
newer organizers. It also allows community members who have been served
by dual power projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming
party members and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy. It ensures that there are formal processes for educating
communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act
and organize in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must
recognize that the current state of the base building movement precludes
the possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [individual
base building organizations ought to adopt party models for their local
organizing. Local organizations ought to be building dual power
alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of community
members in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment of armed
and **militant party cadres** capable of defending dual power
institutions from state terror.]{.underline} Dual power institutions
must be unified openly and transparently around these organizations in
order for them to operate as more than "red charities." Serving the
people means meeting their material needs while also educating and
propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The
party model remains the most useful method for achieving these
ends.]{.underline} The use of the party model by local organizations
allows base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to
mobilize their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not
simply towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an
end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we will see future unification
of the various local base building organizations into a national
party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we must push for party
organizing at the local level. If local organizations adopt party
organizing, [it ought to become clear that]{.underline} **[a unified
national party will have to be the long term goal of the base building
movement.]{.underline}** Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. [I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have demonstrated
the need for party organizing in order to ensure that the base building
tendency maintains a revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer
details of revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are
not a good subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party
organizing offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will
succeed. My goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward
but to open a conversation about how the base building movement will
organize as it transitions from a loose network of individual
organizations into a unified socialist tendency. These discussions and
debates will be crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement
can succeed.

#### That is the only way to challenge capitalism at a same global scale. 

**Escalante, 19** \[Alyson, you should totally read her work for
non-debate reasons, Marxist-Leninist, Materialist Feminist and

Approach,\" Failing That, Invent,
https://failingthatinvent.home.blog/2019/02/15/communism-and-climate-change-a-dual-power-approach/\]//AD

I have previously argued that a crucial advantage to [**dual power**
**strategy**]{.underline} is that it [gives the masses an infrastructure
of socialist **institutions** which can directly provide for **material
needs** in times of **capitalist crisis.** **Socialist agricultural**
and **food distribution programs** can take ground that the **capitalist
state** cedes by simultaneously meeting the needs of the masses while
proving that socialist **self-management** and **political**
**institutions** can function **independently** of
capitalism]{.underline}. This approach is [not only capable of
**literally saving lives** in]{.underline} the case of [crisis,
but]{.underline} of [demonstrating the **possibility of a revolutionary
project** which seeks to **destroy rather than reform** capitalism. One
of the most pressing]{.underline} of the various [crises]{.underline}
which humanity faces today [is climate change]{.underline}. Capitalist
production has devastated the planet, and everyday we discover that the
small window of time for avoiding its most disastrous effects is shorter
than previously understood. [The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change predicts that we have **12 years** to limit]{.underline}
([not]{.underline} even [prevent]{.underline}) the more
[catastrophic]{.underline} effects of [climate change. The]{.underline}
simple, and [horrific, fact that we all must face is that climate change
has reached a point where many]{.underline} of its [effects are
**inevitable**, and we are]{.underline} now [in a **post-brink
world**]{.underline}, [where damage control is the primary concern.
**The question is not whether we can escape**]{.underline} a future of
[**climate change, but whether we can survive it**. Socialist strategy
must adapt accordingly]{.underline}. In the face of this crisis, the
[democratic socialists]{.underline} and social democrats in the United
States have [largely settled on market]{.underline} based [reforms. The
Green New Deal,]{.underline} championed by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and
the left wing of the Democratic Party, remains a thoroughly capitalist
solution to a capitalist problem. The proposal [does nothing to
challenge capitalism]{.underline} itself, [but]{.underline} rather
[seeks to subsidize market solutions to reorient]{.underline} the [US
energy infrastructure towards renewable energy]{.underline} production,
to develop less energy consuming transportation, [and]{.underline} the
[development of public investment towards these ends.]{.underline}
**[The plan does nothing to call into question the profit incentives and
endless resource consumption of capitalism which led us to this
point]{.underline}**. Rather, it [seeks to reorient]{.underline} the
[relentless market forces of capitalism towards slightly less
destructive technological developments. While the plan would lead to a
massive investment in the manufacturing and deployment of solar energy
infrastructure]{.underline}, National Geographic reports that,
"[Fabricating \[solar\] panels **requires caustic chemicals** such as
sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid, and **the process uses water as
well as electricity**, the production of which **emits greenhouse
gases**]{.underline}." [Technology alone cannot sufficiently combat this
crisis, as the production]{.underline} of such technology [through
capitalist manufacturing infrastructure **only perpetuates environmental
harm**.]{.underline} Furthermore, [subsidizing and incentivizing
renewable energy stops far short of actually combating the fossil fuel
industry]{.underline} driving the current climate crisis. The
technocratic market solutions offered in the Green New Deal fail to
adequately combat the driving factors of climate change. What is worse,
they rely on a violent imperialist global system in order to produce
their technological solutions. The [development of high-tech energy
infrastructure and]{.underline} the development of [low]{.underline} or
zero [emission transportation requires]{.underline} the import of [raw
material and rare earth minerals which the United States can only access
because of the imperial division of the Global South.]{.underline} This
imperial division of the world [requires constant **militarism**
from]{.underline} the [imperial core nations]{.underline}, and as Lenin
demonstrates in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism,
[facilitates **constant warfare** as imperial states compete for
**spheres of influence** in order to facilitate cheap resource
extraction]{.underline}. [The US military]{.underline}, one of many
imperialist forces, [is the single largest user of
petroleum]{.underline}, and [one of its main functions is to ensure oil
access for the United States.]{.underline} Without challenging this
imperialist division of the world and the role of the United States
military in upholding it, the Green New Deal fails even further to
challenge the underlying causes of climate change. Even with the failed
promises of the Green New Deal itself, it is unlikely that this tepid
market proposal will pass at all. Nancy Pelosi and other lead Democrats
have largely condemned it and consider it "impractical" and
"unfeasible." This dismissal is crucial because it reveals the total
inability of capitalism to resolve this crisis. If the center-left party
in the heart of the imperial core sees even milquetoast capitalist
reforms as a step too far, we ought to have very little hope that a
reformist solution will present itself within the ever shrinking 12 year
time frame. There are times for delicacy and there are times for
bluntness, and we are in the latter. To put things bluntly: the
[capitalists are not going to save us, and **if we don't find a way to
save ourselves, the collapse of human civilization is a real
possibility.**]{.underline} The pressing question we now face is: **[how
are we going to save ourselves?]{.underline}** Revolution and Dual Power
If capitalism will not be able to resolve the current encroaching
climate crisis, [we must find a way to organize outside the confines of
capitalist institutions, towards the end of overthrowing
capitalism]{.underline}. If the Democratic Socialists of America backed
candidates cannot offer real anti-capitalist solutions through the
capitalist state, we should be skeptical of the possibility for any
socialist organization doing so. [The DSA is far larger and]{.underline}
far more [well funded than any]{.underline} of the [other socialist
organizations]{.underline} in the United States, [and]{.underline} they
have [failed to produce anything more revolutionary than the Green New
Deal]{.underline}. [We have to abandon the idea that electoral strategy
will be sufficient to resolve the underlying causes of this crisis
within 12 years.]{.underline} While many radicals call for revolution
instead of reform, the [reformists]{.underline} often [raise the same
response]{.underline}: revolution is well and good, but [what are you
going to do in the mean time?]{.underline} In many ways this question is
fair. The socialist left in the United States today is not ready for
revolutionary action, and a mass base does not exist to back the various
organizations which might undertake such a struggle. Revolutionaries
must concede that [we have much work to be done before a revolutionary
strategy can be enacted.]{.underline} This is a hard truth, but it is
true. Much of [the left has sought to ignore this truth by embracing
adventurism and violent protest theatrics, in the]{.underline} vain
[hope of sparking]{.underline} revolutionary [momentum]{.underline}
which does not currently exist. [If this is the core strategy of the
socialist left, **we will accomplish nothing in the next 12
years**]{.underline}. Such approaches are as useless as the opportunist
reforms pushed by the social democrats. Our task in these 12 years is
not simply to arm ourselves and hope that magically the masses will wake
up prepared for revolution and willing to put their trust in our small
ideological cadres. [We must]{.underline} instead, [build a
movement]{.underline}, and [with]{.underline} it we must build
[infrastructure which can survive revolution and provide a framework for
socialist development]{.underline}. [Dual power is tooled towards this
project best. **The Marxist Center** network has done an impressive
amount of work developing socialist institutions across the
US]{.underline}, largely [through **tenants organizing** and **serve the
people programs**]{.underline}. The [left wing factions within the
DSA]{.underline} itself have also begun to [develop **mutual aid
programs** that could be useful for dual power strategy]{.underline}.
[At the same time, **mutual aid is not enough**. We cannot simply build
these institutions as a reform to make capitalism more
survivable.]{.underline} Rather, [we must make these institutions part
of a **broader revolutionary movement** and]{.underline} [they ought to
function as a material prefiguration to a socialist society and
economy]{.underline}. The institutions we build as [dual power outside
the capitalist state today ought to be structured towards revolutionary
ends, such that they will someday function as the early institutions of
a revolutionary socialist society.]{.underline} To accomplish this goal,
[we cannot simply declare these institutions to be
revolutionary]{.underline}. Rather **[they have to be linked together
through an actual revolutionary movement working towards revolutionary
ends]{.underline}**. [This means that dual power institutions cannot
exist as ends in and of themselves, nor can abstract notions of mutual
aid cannot be conceptualized as an end in itself]{.underline}. [The
explicit purpose of these institutions has to be to **radicalize** the
masses through meeting their needs, and providing an infrastructure for
a socialist movement to meet **the needs of** its members and the
**communities** in which it operates. **Revolutionary institutions**
that **can provide food, housing**, and other needs for a revolutionary
movement will be crucial for **build**ing **a base**]{.underline} among
the masses [and]{.underline} for [constructing]{.underline} the
[beginnings of a socialist infrastructure for when we]{.underline}
eventually [engage in revolutionary struggle.]{.underline}

### Block -- AT: Perm

Library of Philadelphia), "Base-Building: Activist Networking or

**[The dominant left-wing political forms of our present moment are
either amorphous "movements" without formal structures,
or]{.underline}** nongovernmental organizations (also known as
**[nonprofits or NGOs).]{.underline}** [**Radicals should reject both of
these options and form explicitly political** organizations (anarchist,
Marxist, socialist, communist, whatever).]{.underline} Socialists should
not be afraid to take on organizing work which overlaps with organizing
currently being undertaken by the NGOs. But instead of "tailing" the
activity of liberal NGOs by providing volunteers for their efforts, we
should carry out this work under our own banner: the banner of
socialism. [Instead of "subsuming" or "liquidating" our work into the
amorphous "movement", we should found political centers which engage in
community and workplace organizing, while simultaneously participating
in standard leftist activities such as protests and political education.
**The task of radicals, at present must be digging in deep to the class,
going "to the masses," building long-term relationships with layers of
oppressed and working class people, and organizing in our neighborhoods
and workplaces**]{.underline}. This is the punishing, demoralizing grind
work that activists prefer to avoid, but it constitutes the only way
forward. **[One major strategic error of the Left]{.underline}** in the
past several decades **[has been]{.underline}** using a method of
analysis which we might refer to as **["issue-ism."]{.underline}**
**[The idea here is that among struggles]{.underline}** against
imperialist foreign policy, against police brutality, in support of
LBGTQ rights or workers rights, etc[**. we can choose to embrace one
while rejecting another**. Deeply-rooted social contradictions are
treated as though they were consumer choices]{.underline}, which might
be mixed and matched based on our personal preferences, as one might put
different items from a grocery store into a grocery cart. [Most
activists who have engaged in single-issue work come to understand the
limitations of this sort of politics**. The majority of activists either
repudiate active political struggle entirely, or break toward
reformism**]{.underline}. Among more experienced political actors, there
is another path which we also regard as an error: that is to imagine
that combining some or all of the issues into a giant progressive
coalition will lead to liberation. **[Many look to a "movement of
movements" strategy]{.underline}**, [holding out hope that uniting all
progressive struggles together will somehow add up to more than the sum
of its parts]{.underline}. However, despite its long-standing and
generally untheorized popularity on the left, **[this strategy has
produced little in the way of material gains for the working
class.]{.underline}** The "movement of movements" strategy has
historically been prone to rightist and leftist deviations. **[The
rightist error]{.underline}** (and the most common outcome) of a
"Rainbow Coalition**[" is]{.underline}** overtly or covertly
**[corralling the social movements into the quagmire of the Democratic
Party]{.underline}**. **[The leftist deviation can be called "activist
networking." Activist networking is what might be called lifestyle
activism]{.underline}**, in the sense of individuals who form their
identity around being an activist and derive the majority of their
social life from activism. These are the type of people who do not
engage with, are not comfortable around and are not friends with
non-activists or non-theory types, and [**whose weekly and monthly
schedules are a busybody itinerary of meetings, discussion groups,
protests, and conferences.** These individuals are not particularly
concerned with effectiveness, because for then it is more of a hobby, an
identity, or a "safe space" for like-minded people to discuss common
interests without having to engage with working class people with their
warts and all. **In terms of practice, the "activist networking" model
is one wherein activists from one organization agree to attend the
events put on by activists from another group with the expectation that
the latter will reciprocate by attending in return the favor. This often
creates a comical scenario 20 different organizations "endorse" an event
at which only 40 people show up. The final outcome of this model is to
create an "activist circuit" where the same dozen or so single-issue
activists attend each others protests in a round-robin of stagnant or
diminishing numbers**]{.underline}. Even when political pressure turns
up the volume (i.e. an issue is newsworthy or politically salient and
therefore drives larger attendance at the events organized by the
activists) the lifeless cycle of activist networking eventually brings
down the numbers of attendees back to pre-crisis levels. **[Both of
these are poor substitutes for a genuinely intersectional
politics.]{.underline}** HK1.jpg An example of the two contrasting
approaches would be as follows: A political group employing an
activist-networking approach is looking for a new campaign. They read
the news to find "hot issues" that are being reported on in the media.
**[Once they've determined the issue they want to agitate around, they
look for an NGO they can "partner" with, providing warm bodies to show
up at the NGO's events and to help actuate the already-existing strategy
of the NGO]{.underline}**. [Often this looks like showing up to City
Hall or the state capitol, as part of a coalition of "the usual
suspects," to lobby legislators to support or oppose a particular bill,
or showing up at a rally put on by the NGO in command of the
campaign]{.underline}. [Usually the passage of a law is the primary goal
of these campaigns.]{.underline} Maybe the group might try to recruit
one or two participants from the action, but since most of these people
are already organized and are members of one of the larger groups, only
a handful of people are brought into the organization. **[As enthusiasm
inevitably drains from the campaign in the face of setbacks,
participation bleeds away, so the group ends up back at square one, or
worse, end up with fewer people involved than they started
with.]{.underline}** At this point, groups usually cut their losses and
look for the new "hot issue" of the day, thus repeating the cycle. **[A
political group which takes a "base-building" approach toward organizing
a constituency approaches "issue" work a bit differently.]{.underline}**
[The first step involves a canvassing the "base" where the group is
attempting to organize: talking to coworkers, knocking on doors in a
neighborhood, or chatting with commuters on the train or at the bus
stop.]{.underline} Since the vast majority of individuals in our society
are not members of a particular political group or even a union, we say
that recruiting someone from a working class constituency into a mass
organization **[is an act of "organizing the
unorganized."]{.underline}** Simultaneous to this, research is
undertaken to get a sense of where the constituency is situated in the
process of capital accumulation and in the "big picture" of the
capitalist system. **[Through conversations and research, several
possible demands or campaigns are sketched out, based around criteria
such as winnability, the likelihood that the campaign will build
capacity of the organization, help cohere working class
forces]{.underline}** (rather than promote temporary cross-class
alliances), **[and whether the campaign has the potential to encourage
grassroots militancy]{.underline}** (rather than transporting the arena
of struggle to specialist-only spaces such as the courts through, for
instance, pursuing lawsuits as a primary tactic). [When several possible
ideas for campaigns are produced, organizers return to the constituency
and sound out these ideas in various conversations to find out what
demands (if any) attract support and gain interest of the constituency,
then tweak and modify these as needed]{.underline}. **[Around that time,
a mass meeting is called, contacts made during the conversation phase
are invited in, and a democratic process unfolds where the most active
elements of the constituency choose a campaign and begin
working]{.underline}** **[on it. This is sometimes referred to as the
"mass line" method]{.underline}**: from the masses, to the masses.
**[While engaging in the campaign, smart organizers always keep in mind
that the most important end product of the campaign is new and more
experienced militants, rather than reforms, laws, or material
gains.]{.underline}** The latter are welcome and while ostensibly the
temporary goal of the group, they serve as fuel for the organization to
reach the long-term goal: the production of working class militants,
trained to fight and think critically about the capitalist system and
their place in it. This may mean taking more time and effort on
leadership development and political education than appears immediately
practical for the purposes of winning a demand. To use the Marxist
jargon, a common fight is how working people from wildly different
backgrounds can cohere around a shared **[vision. What is needed at the
present moment is a politics that is rooted in the working class, forged
where disparate elements of the class can find common political ground
against a common enemy.]{.underline}**
