[Danger signs are flashing at the degree to which the US has allowed
itself to **fall behind in shipbuilding**]{.underline}. It has fallen
from global shipbuilding leadership in 1975 to 19th place today. The
United Nations reports that only 0.13% of the world's shipbuilding
capacity resides in North America. In contrast, [China is by far the
**top global shipbuilder**]{.underline}, [responsible for "more than
**half of the world's commercial shipbuilding output**]{.underline}"
last year.

Unless it changes current trajectories, [the US risks the hazardous
possibility of **trailing revisionist powers** in the size of fleets it
can field in **key theaters**]{.underline}. [The US should do **all it
can to expand its domestic shipbuilding capacity**]{.underline}. [The
lead time required to expand capacity and then build more ships risks
extending beyond the deadlines when a greater fleet size is
required.]{.underline} That is why [it is vital to for the US to embrace
collaborations]{.underline} such as the recent ICE Pact (with Canada and
Finland) to build icebreakers, along with AUKUS (with Australia and the
UK) to build more submarines. Joint effort can speed progress. Deepening
these collaborations and adding others are vital to America's maritime
security.

The Arctic is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) front
receiving insufficient attention. It is rich in resources and emerging
sea-lanes. It is also strategically important militarily, particularly
as defense preparations in Alaska, Canada, and Nordic nations trail
Russian threats. China threw its weight into the Arctic by declaring
itself a Near-Arctic power. It joined Russia in sailing a naval force of
11 ships close to America's Aleutian Islands last August. Its Polar Silk
Road will be cleared with Chinese icebreakers.

**[The US alone has only two aging diesel icebreakers in the
Arctic]{.underline}** [compared to Russia's "seven nuclear-powered
icebreakers and around 30 diesel-powered ones,"]{.underline} [with more
being built. Collectively, **NATO trails Russia and China in
icebreakers**]{.underline}. Adding to the imbalance, [Russia has
launched a new class of combat icebreakers with high-speed guns and
launchers for anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles. These risks,
coupled with the US Coast Guard's new Polar Security Cutter program
being **years behind schedule** and billions of dollars over
budget,]{.underline} underlie the logic of the ICE Pact.

The Pentagon estimates that the People's Liberation Army Navy has more
than 370 ships, compared with America's combat-ready fleet of 290
(though America has more carriers and destroyers and superior
submarines). The gap is expected to widen. China's fleet is expected to
grow 21 percent by 2030, while the US Navy's latest budget submission
projects that the US fleet will remain largely unchanged. Staying ahead
with submarines highlights the need for AUKUS.

These collaborations allow allies to share expertise, build supplier
networks, develop programs for training a skilled workforce, and ensure
interoperability. Maximizing the benefits of collaboration requires
pushing past resistance points. Following China, Japan and South Korea
are the largest shipbuilding nations. Some have suggested Japan, South
Korea, and the US should mirror the AUKUS framework or the F-35
Lightning supplier network to create a multinational guided-missile
destroyer construction program. Continued partnering with allies for
ship maintenance also adds capacity and strengthens alliances.

[Not only must America grow its shipbuilding capacity to stay
ahead,]{.underline} but [it will also need to foster a network of
**allied capacity**]{.underline} [to ensure it can meet]{.underline}
**[urgent needs]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} rapidly [resupply to
cover **losses in the event of conflict**]{.underline}. [For all this,
the US must embrace the ICE Pact, AUKUS, and more]{.underline}.

#### The ICE PACT, a collaboration effort was signed between the US, Canda, and Finland to strengthen shipbuilding, but the pact isn't sufficient and sidesteps the true problems behind US shipbuilding. Only the plan ensures [predictability]{.underline} that strengthens the industry.

[The recently announced]{.underline} Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
([ICE-PACT]{.underline}) by the US, Canada, and Finland, [is a
collaboration intended to strengthen shipbuilding]{.underline} and
maritime industrial capacity through closer cooperation on polar
icebreakers.

[Icebreakers are **highly specialized platforms**]{.underline}, built to
withstand some of the most punishing conditions on earth. They sail
directly into ice that can crush ships and pierce hulls, and into storms
that can ice over superstructures until ships become so top-heavy they
capsize. [The engineering requirements for polar icebreakers are
daunting]{.underline}.

[In the US]{.underline}, the [specialized expertise]{.underline}
required to build polar icebreakers [has **largely
vanished**]{.underline} in the decades since the last such ship was
built. [The US Coast Guard's current acquisition program, the Polar
Security Cutter, has experienced **significant challenges**, including
time **delays** and **cost overruns**.]{.underline}

[The Coast Guard's challenges echo similar problems **bedeviling US Navy
shipbuilding**]{.underline}. Navy Secretary Del Toro has championed
efforts to spur competition from foreign shipbuilders, including calling
for coproduction with foreign shipyards and increasing reliance on
overseas repair and maintenance. [These efforts are constrained by
limits on Coast Guard and Navy ability to contract with foreign
shipyards.]{.underline}

In contrast to Del Toro's emphasis on increasing competition, [US
shipbuilding interests usually call for more **predictability in
orders**]{.underline}, more [subsidies to industry]{.underline}, and
[more investment in labor programs.]{.underline}

**[ICE-PACT sidesteps these questions]{.underline}** in favor of three
objectives: information sharing, collaboration on workforce development,
and an invitation to allies and partners to purchase icebreakers built
in American, Canadian, and Finnish shipyards. Here the ICE-PACT
announcement echoes another trilateral effort---AUKUS---which similarly
emphasized information sharing and strengthening of all parties'
industrial bases.

[The ICE-PACT agreement is a **first step**]{.underline}: the US,
Canada, and Finland [will engage in trilateral negotiations this year on
a framework for implementation]{.underline}. In the meantime,
[icebreaker construction programs are ongoing in both the US and
Canada]{.underline}. [These are likely to be **little impacted by the
new agreement**]{.underline}.

[The primary impact of ICE-PACT]{.underline} at this point [is the
demonstration of **high-level attention** to the]{.underline} [issue by
the White House]{.underline}, [and the credence this lends efforts to
find **creative solutions** to the broader set of US shipbuilding
woes]{.underline}. While unlikely to reach the scale and scope of AUKUS,
[the ICE-PACT agreement]{.underline} [signifies **sustained interest**
from the Biden administration in partnering with key allies on
**critical naval technology.**]{.underline}

#### The plan is key to solve\-\--only domestic icebreakers spur shipbuilding independence. Allied over-reliance ensures coercion.

[One of the **biggest challenges** facing the United States'
**capability** and capacity to]{.underline} [**defend** its
**interests** in the far north is the **dearth of
icebreakers**]{.underline}. [Icebreakers]{.underline} are imperative to
the national security of the United States and its Arctic territories.
Their [importance is]{.underline} also [growing due to the continued
**melting** of the **polar ice caps**]{.underline}, [the encroachment of
non-Arctic nations to the region]{.underline}, including China, [and
heightened tensions over]{.underline} pre-existing [territorial
disputes]{.underline} [and new economic opportunities in
the]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline}. However, [**despite** their
**importance**, the United States' **fleet** of icebreakers has been
**severely neglected**.]{.underline}

**[Icebreakers are indispensable]{.underline}** [to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [for a **multitude** of
**reasons**]{.underline}. Not only do they keep trade routes free from
winter sea ice and escort shipping vessels safely through ice-covered
passages, but they also help supply winter bases, oil rigs, drill sites,
and scientific missions with the necessary equipment and cargo
year-round. With the retreating northern ice caps, global shipping is
increasingly using northern routes for Asia to European trade bypassing
the Panama and Suez canal. These shifts can drastically cut shipping
times but also allow nations with a significant arctic fleet to hold
global trade at risk.

[The icebreakers also serve the vitally important role of protecting
**energy claims** and **keeping fisheries** from **foreign
exploitation**]{.underline}. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that
the Arctic holds over 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,669 trillion cubic
feet of gas, the majority of which is commercially viable. Additionally,
Arctic fisheries offer a vast, and growing, source of wealth for Arctic
nations --- the average annual catch value is estimated at over \$500
million, another incentive for non-arctic states to encroach on the
region. Just last year a massive Chinese fishing fleet encroached on
U.S. territorial waters with no regard for international law or
sustainable fishing regulations.

**[Icebreakers]{.underline}** often [serve as moving research
institutions]{.underline} and [platforms]{.underline} with teams
[conducting **scientific research** in the Arctic, including vital
**climate change-focused**]{.underline} **[research]{.underline}**
[helping to tackle one of the **region's largest threats**]{.underline}.
The simple presence of icebreakers in the Arctic also sends an important
message to potential adversarial nations showcasing the United States'
readiness and willingness to defend its interests in the region.

[Despite these growing needs, the U.S. Coast Guard currently **only
operates two** **icebreakers**]{.underline}, the Polar Star (already 10
years over its 30-year life expectancy) and Healy (which suffered an
electrical fire in 2020 and was only recently repaired), both
diesel-powered. The only other two U.S.-based icebreakers are privately
owned or operated by the University of Alaska.

In comparison, China operates two (and is developing a third), while
Russia's armed forces operate at least 46 --- including three that are
nuclear-powered, extending both their power and durability. These
numbers do not take into account those currently under construction or
planned, and both nations are investing heavily in expanding their
fleets. Russia has also re-militarized a dozen Cold War-era arctic bases
to expand its naval presence in the region and to use as berths for its
numerous active icebreakers.

**[NATO allies]{.underline}** in the region, [such as **Norway and
Canada**]{.underline}, [also own icebreaker fleets.]{.underline}
However, **[none of them are nuclear-powered]{.underline}**. [Norway's
fleet is focused on]{.underline} [territorial defense]{.underline}
against increasingly aggressive Russian incursions while Canada's fleet
is currently comprised of smaller vessels focusing on scientific
research and search and rescue efforts. Thus, [the U.S. cannot rely on
its **Northern** or **European**]{.underline} [**allies** for **defense
posturing** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [This lack of a substantial U.S.
fleet of]{.underline} [icebreakers, the absence of **nuclear-powered**
**vessels**, and **reliance** on allied]{.underline}
**[icebreaker]{.underline}** [posturing in the region is a **major
flaw** in the US national security strategy]{.underline} and defensive
umbrella, [which needs to be addressed as **quickly as
possible**]{.underline} and is an important strategic investment the
United States needs to make immediately.

Currently, the two Coast Guard icebreakers fall under the jurisdiction
of the Department of Homeland Security whose budget is anemic compared
to the Department of Defense. [The Coast Guard does not have the budget
to obtain enough]{.underline} [icebreakers to **contest Russian** or
**Chinese** presence in the Arctic]{.underline} --- [each heavy
icebreaker has an **average cost** of approximately \$800
million]{.underline}. While, accumulating the same number of icebreakers
as Russia is unnecessary, moving forward all potential solutions to
securing America's North requires the purchase of icebreakers,
regardless of their status: new or used. Coast Guard Commandant Karl
Schultz has stated that "a fleet of nine U.S.-flagged icebreakers" would
be sufficient to meet our economic and security needs in the far north.

Thankfully, Congress has already initiated expanding America's arctic
security program by authorizing the construction of six new Polar
Security Cutters (PSCs), three heavy and three medium icebreakers.
However, it is only actively funding the first four.

The next vital step to securing the North is to fully fund and expedite
the construction of these six PSCs, especially given the fact that the
first PSC is currently planned to be delivered only in late 2024 if it
stays on schedule. This is extremely important as expanding the current
fleet's missions comes with opportunity costs, thus necessitating a
larger fleet to be able to cover all possible icebreaker missions in the
region.

[Another longer-term option]{.underline}, which can also be done
simultaneously to the PSC program, [is to increase the available funding
for the **Coast Guard**]{.underline}, [specifically focused on **Arctic
security**]{.underline}, [to **establish** **partnerships** with
**private corporations** to]{.underline} [**design** and **construct**
the United States' first **nuclear-powered icebreaking
vessel**.]{.underline} While more expensive, [**nuclear icebreakers**
come with many benefits over diesel-powered vessels]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} [both]{.underline} **[longevity]{.underline}**,
[**range**, and **power**]{.underline}, [including increasingly vital,
**soft power**. With the additional range and longevity of nuclear
icebreakers]{.underline} [comes a reduced need for the United States to
build **expensive** and **difficult** to **maintain arctic
bases**]{.underline} [--- the icebreakers become de facto **mobile
bases**.]{.underline} Additionally, [the nuclear-powered ships can
conduct **longer** and **more missions**, **cementing U.S. positioning
in the region**.]{.underline}

A different and swifter approach would involve working with the
Department of the Navy to authorize the purchase of an icebreaker under
the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. This would not only expand the Navy's
mission to include patrolling of the far North but could also lead to
involving NATO forces in the region. This would also be a welcome step
to counteract Russia's recent decision to establish a new Arctic fleet
within their navy, acting as a strong signal of America's willingness
and readiness to defend its northern territories and those of its
allies.

Regardless which option is given the go-ahead, it would also be
beneficial to simultaneously encourage the development or purchase of
private icebreakers, whether by corporations or public institutions. For
example, there is also an existing U.S. icebreaker available for
purchase, the Aiviq, currently owned by Edison Chouest Offshore, valued
at only \$150 million. There are also ships in Finland available for
lease that could fill gaps until the PSCs come online. The private
purchase and leasing options would maximize the United States' presence
in the region.

[For the United States to remain economically]{.underline} and
militarily [competitive]{.underline} **[in the Arctic]{.underline}** and
maintain its territorial integrity in the region[, it requires a
substantial fleet of new, **advanced**, and **durable icebreakers**, as
**soon as possible**.]{.underline} The first vital step is to fully fund
and expedite the construction of the currently authorized six PSCs.
These will enable the United States to continue to secure the freedom of
the seas, ensure its national security, and expand economic and academic
opportunities to its institutions in the region and beyond.

#### New ships are particularly important. They generate advanced manufacturing which is key to a sustainable shipbuilding industry.

The **[Biden]{.underline}** administration previously [identified
**icebreaker ships** as a **promising**]{.underline} **[starting
point]{.underline}**, [and I would **expect continuity
here**]{.underline}. [In addition to the geopolitical]{.underline}
[**importance** of the **Arctic**]{.underline}, [it may be easier for
the US to compete in markets for **relatively specialised
vessels**]{.underline} [--- such as **icebreakers** --- where **price**
and **quantity** are not the only factors that buyers typically
consider.]{.underline}

Moreover, [there are]{.underline} some [benefits to starting from
**virtually zero**]{.underline}. [The need to construct new facilities
is an opportunity to **deploy** at scale the most **advanced
manufacturing technologies**]{.underline}. [It should also be easier to
optimise the co-location of new **commercial** and **defence production
facilities**, rather than deal with **stranded** legacy **assets**. This
presents an **opportunity** to build a **larger manufacturing
ecosystem** that includes the **adjacent technologies**, supply chains
and applications required for any shipyard to operate
effectively.]{.underline}

Ultimately, however, the shipbuilding industry is a game of competitive
subsidisation. The major shipbuilding nations provide considerable
support to their industries, and Michael Lind has recently shown how the
elimination of subsidies under the Reagan administration resulted in the
precipitous decline of US shipyards despite the Jones Act.

With that in mind, [US policymakers will need to **consider** more
**robust forms of** **investment support**,]{.underline} [in addition to
the **measures** **already announced** by the Trump
**administration**]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline}
**[shipyards]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the vessels they produce
[provide]{.underline} ample [opportunities for]{.underline}
[creative]{.underline} public-private financing structures as well [as
**procurement** and **contracting mechanisms**]{.underline}. [America
has somehow managed to financially engineer seemingly everything except
**critical national security** **supply chains** and **technologies**;
**shipbuilding** offers a **chance to rectify that**.]{.underline}

#### Shipbuilding solves [extinction]{.underline}\-\--shortage of overall capacity causes [every existential risk]{.underline} and [eviscerates deterrence]{.underline}.

"[He who commands the sea has command of everything]{.underline}," the
ancient Athenian general Themistocles said. By that standard, the United
States has command of very little.

[America **depends on ocean shipping**]{.underline}. About [80 percent
of its international trade by weight traverses the seas]{.underline}.
[The U.S. needs ships to deliver nearly 90 percent of its armed forces'
supplies and equipment, including **fuel**, **ammunition**, and
**food**. Commercial shipyard capacity is **essential** for **surge
construction of warships and sealift-support ships that transport
equipment and troops in times of national emergency**.]{.underline}

Yet [the U.S. has an **astonishing lack** of **maritime
capacity**]{.underline}. Of the tens of thousands of large vessels that
dot the oceans, a mere 0.13 percent are built in the United States.
**[China]{.underline}**, by contrast, [fulfills roughly **60 percent of
all new shipbuilding orders**]{.underline} and has amassed more than 200
times America's shipbuilding capacity.

Not only do most U.S. imports and exports travel on foreign-built ships,
but those ships are owned and crewed almost exclusively by nine giant
carriers based in Europe and Asia. By the end of 2024, these carriers
had organized into three cartels that controlled about 90 percent of the
U.S. containerized-shipping trade.

From the July 1870 issue: The shipping of the United States

After a ship arrives at a U.S. port, the crane that lifts containers
from its cargo hold will probably have been made by a single Chinese
corporation that produces 80 percent of all ship-to-shore cranes in the
United States. China also makes 86 percent of the truck chassis onto
which containers are loaded. Some 95 percent of the containers
themselves are built in China.

In the early days of the pandemic, some consequences of America's loss
of control over ocean shipping were suddenly thrown into relief. Foreign
cartels raised the cost of spot contracts on certain shipping lanes by
up to 1,000 percent while making a record \$190 billion in windfall
profits. They also rejected hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of
U.S. agricultural exports, preferring to race back to China with empty
containers to fill with more profitable Chinese imports while
American-grown food rotted on the docks.

[The **national-security implications** of]{.underline} [America's lack
of shipbuilding and shipping capacity are also **becoming
dire**]{.underline}. Because so few commercial ships fly the American
flag and employ American mariners, [the U.S. faces a critical **shortage
of civilian sailors** needed to crew Navy support vessels]{.underline}.
In November 2024, [the Navy confirmed that it would lay up 17 support
vessels, some delivered as recently as January 2024, because of crew
shortages. More alarming are shortages of support ships themselves. The
U.S. would need more than 100 fuel tankers **in the event of a conflict
in the Pacific**.]{.underline} It has access to about 15.

#### Allowing China to continue to keep its lead in shipbuilding ensures [escalation]{.underline} and invasion of [Taiwan]{.underline}.

[China's preeminence in shipbuilding should be **concerning** in face of
the looming threat of a **Chinese invasion of Taiwan**]{.underline}.
[The PLAN currently has **400 ships**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[contrast to the U.S. Navy's 295]{.underline}. While China is projected
to reach 425 military vessels by the year 2030, [the U.S. fleet is
projected to **grow by just five ships**]{.underline}---if it is [even
able to achieve that given the **lackluster performance**]{.underline}
of past efforts to grow the fleet. [Though U.S. ships have superior
technology]{.underline}, [this advantage only goes so far to compete
against a larger navy in a prolonged conflict]{.underline}. [The
**D**]{.underline}epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense's [shipbuilding plan for fiscal year 2025
projects]{.underline} [a fleet of 390 ships by 2054]{.underline};
[however]{.underline}, [this projection is **wildly insufficient** to
match the pace at which China is producing ships and their **increasing
aggression towards Taiwan**]{.underline}.

The [commercial shipbuilding front is **no better**]{.underline}. [China
produces more ships than]{.underline} **[the rest of the world
combined]{.underline}**, [while the United States accounts for only 0.1
percent of global shipbuilding]{.underline}. Of the commercial ships
China produces, over 75 percent are sold to other countries including
U.S. military allies. This revenue from Chinese commercial ships
effectively subsidizes their military ship production given the close
ties between the two industries, further fueling Beijing's growing naval
advantage over the United States. China's own commercial fleet now
numbers nearly 5,500 ships, while [the United States has fewer than 100
in international trade. In short, China's shipbuilding industry has a
**competitive advantage** over that of the United States with **dire
consequences**]{.underline}.

Containing trade wars is a start, but [Beijing and Washington
should]{.underline} also work to end or at least [**contain hot wars**
that could trigger]{.underline} a **[much wider
conflagration]{.underline}**. During intense great-power competition,
[even **small conflicts** could easily have **disastrous consequences**,
as]{.underline} the lead-up to [World War I showed]{.underline}. Take,
for instance, Russia's current war of aggression against Ukraine. Last
year's offensives and counteroffensives did not change the frontlines a
great deal; Western countries hope to work toward a cease-fire in
Ukraine under the best conditions that Ukrainian valor and Western
weapons can achieve. For now, a Ukrainian victory would consist of the
repulsion of the initial all-out 2022 Russian offensive as well as terms
that end the killing of Ukrainians, fast-track the country's accession
into the EU, and obtain Kyiv security guarantees from the West in case
of Russian cease-fire violations. Many in the Western camp hope that
China could play a constructive role in such negotiations, since Beijing
has stressed "respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
all countries." China should remember that one of Germany's major
mistakes before World War I was to stand by as Austria-Hungary harassed
its neighbors in the Balkans even as German leaders appealed to the high
principles of international justice. This hypocrisy helped produce war
in 1914. Right now, China is repeating that mistake with its treatment
of Russia.

Although the war in Ukraine is now causing the most tension, it is
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** that [could be the **Balkans** of the
20**20s**. Both **China** and]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [seem to be **sleepwalking**
toward]{.underline} a [cross-strait **confrontation**]{.underline} at
some point [within the **next decade**. An **increasing** number of
China's foreign policy experts]{.underline} now [think]{.underline} that
[war over Taiwan is]{.underline} more **[likely]{.underline}** than not,
and [U.S. policymakers are preoccupied with]{.underline} the [question
of how]{.underline} best [to **support the island**]{.underline}. What
is remarkable about the Taiwan situation is that it is clear to all
involved---except, perhaps, to the Taiwanese most fixed on achieving
formal independence---that only one possible compromise can likely help
avoid disaster. In the Shanghai Communique of 1972, the United States
acknowledged that there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of
China. Beijing has repeatedly stated that it seeks an eventual peaceful
unification with Taiwan. A restatement of these principles today would
help prevent a conflict: Washington could say that it will under no
circumstances support Taiwan's independence, and Beijing could declare
that it will not use force unless Taiwan formally takes steps toward
becoming independent. Such a compromise would not make all the problems
related to Taiwan go away. But it would make a great-power war over
Taiwan much less likely.

Reining in economic confrontation and [dampening potential **regional
flash points** are **essential** for avoiding]{.underline} a [repeat
of]{.underline} the [British-German scenario]{.underline}, but [the rise
of]{.underline} hostility between China and the United States has also
made many other issues urgent. There is a desperate need for arms
control initiatives and for dealing with other conflicts, such as that
between the Israelis and the Palestinians. There is a demand for signs
of mutual respect. When, in 1972, Soviet and U.S. leaders agreed to a
set of "Basic Principles of Relations Between the United States of
America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," the joint
declaration achieved almost nothing concrete. But it built a modicum of
trust between both sides and helped convince Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev that the Americans were not out to get him. If Xi, like
Brezhnev, intends to remain leader for life, that is an investment worth
making.

The [rise of **great-power tensions**]{.underline} also
[creates]{.underline} the [need to maintain **believable deterrence**.
There is a]{.underline} persistent **[myth]{.underline}** that
[**alliance systems** led to war in 1914 and]{.underline} that a [web of
mutual **defense treaties** ensnared governments]{.underline} in a
conflict [that became impossible to contain]{.underline}. In fact, [what
made war]{.underline} almost [a **certainty** after]{.underline} the
[European powers started mobilizing]{.underline} against one another in
July 1914 [was Germany's **ill-considered hope**]{.underline} that
[Britain **might not**]{.underline}, after all, [come to]{.underline}
the [**assistance** of its friends and **allies**. For the

US President Donald [Trump]{.underline} has [announced **big plans** for
a powerful air and missile defence shield across North
America]{.underline}. [But he can't build it **without
Canada**]{.underline}, and [it's still not clear if Canada wants to be
part of it,]{.underline} reports Politico.

The massive initiative is dubbed [the "Golden Dome]{.underline}" and [is
estimated to cost at least \$175 billion]{.underline}. The [system
relies **heavily on Canada's cooperation**]{.underline}. [At the heart
of the project is the use of **Canadian Arctic** **territory** to host
**radar stations** and **tracking systems** vital for intercepting
missiles from countries like **Russia** and **China**.]{.underline}

"Would it be helpful? Probably, but it's not vital or existential," said
US Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, downplaying Canada's role. But many
defence experts and officials have argued otherwise.

'What Canada really brings Is terrain'

[The United States faces a **serious gap**]{.underline} [in its missile
defences in its northern flank.]{.underline} [Missiles fired from across
the North Pole could **evade detection**]{.underline} unless
early-warning systems are placed deep into Canada's Arctic. That makes
Canadian cooperation critical.

"[What Canada really brings **is terrain,"**]{.underline} said retired
US Air Force General Glen VanHerck, former head of US Northern Command.

"If we can position, or Canada positions, over-the-horizon radars
further north in the Arctic, that dramatically increases the United
States and Canada's ability to see over the pole into Russia, into China
and other places."

Despite this, **[Trump seemed to dismiss Canada's role]{.underline}**
[when he announced the project on Tuesday]{.underline}. "They want to
have protection also, so as usual, we help Canada," he said.

But [Canadian leaders are **not rushing to join the
effort**.]{.underline} Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has shown
hesitation, urging the US to be careful and warning that **[Canada
should not be taken for granted]{.underline}**. "[It's something that we
are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high
level]{.underline}," he said on Wednesday. "[But not --- sure, one
negotiates on this]{.underline}."

#### That forces the US to fall behind on critical missile competition in the arctic because of the lack of access to key routes and infrastructure. Falling behind in icebreakers is [terminal]{.underline}.

[The Wall Street Journal has published a report detailing how Russia is
expanding its **military and economic presence in the
Arctic**]{.underline}, [working closely with China while **outpacing the
U.S.** in the region]{.underline}. With NATO increasing its own military
exercises, the Arctic has become a key geopolitical battleground. [As
climate change opens new shipping routes and access to resources, Russia
and China are **strengthening their positions**]{.underline} [while the
U.S. **struggles to catch up.**]{.underline}

Russia and China strengthen Arctic presence

[Russia has resumed large-scale **Arctic military
exercises**]{.underline}, including [nuclear submarine **missile
drills** near NATO territories.]{.underline} [Joint
Russian-Chinese]{.underline} **[bomber flights]{.underline}** [near
Alaska and naval patrols in Arctic waters highlight increasing military
cooperation between the two countries.]{.underline}

The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the
planet, reducing sea ice and making new shipping lanes accessible.
Russia's Northern Sea Route cuts transit times between Asia and Europe
by two weeks compared to the Suez Canal. Canada is exploring Arctic
deepwater ports to compete.

[Russia has reopened and modernized Soviet-era Arctic bases, including
the heavily fortified Nagurskoye Base]{.underline}, [which can house
strategic bombers and missile defense systems. **With over 36
icebreakers, many nuclear-powered, Russia vastly outnumbers the U.S.,
which has only three.**]{.underline}

[U.S.]{.underline} and NATO **[struggle to keep up]{.underline}**

[The U.S. and Canada are modernizing NORAD,]{.underline} [but aging
radar and new Russian-Chinese hypersonic missiles **pose
challenges**]{.underline}. The U.S. is acquiring more F-35 fighter jets
and icebreakers to close the gap. NATO has held Arctic wargames, but
infrastructure limitations remain a concern.

Russia's Arctic contributes around 10% of its GDP, including significant
oil, gas, and fishing resources. China is a major investor in Russian
Arctic energy projects, securing preferential access to resources.
Meanwhile, the Arctic seabed may hold vast untapped oil, gas, and
critical minerals, sparking territorial disputes.

Declaring itself a "near-Arctic" state, China has expanded its
scientific research stations, shipping routes, and Arctic military
cooperation with Russia. Their first joint Arctic patrol in 2024
signaled a new level of strategic partnership.

Infrastructure challenges in North America

[The U.S. lacks **deepwater Arctic ports**]{.underline} and [sufficient
**roads and rail infrastructure**]{.underline} [in Alaska]{.underline}.
[Canada]{.underline}, despite its vast Arctic territory, [has only one
deepwater Arctic port, located 500 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
This limits North America's **ability to project power in the

counter enemy missiles as well as counter measures fitted on missiles as

<https://archive.ph/SBu4w#selection-3419.3-3419.19> HDCSW-Packet

Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
directing the Defense Department to build an "Iron Dome" missile defense
shield over the United States. Almost immediately, some experts
expressed skepticism, comparing it to former President Ronald Reagan's
unrealized "Star Wars" plans in the 1980s and questioning whether it
would be possible to design a perfect missile shield over such a large
country.

But **[Trump is right]{.underline}**. [A U.S. **homeland missile defense
system** is both technically possible and **necessary** to **defend**
the country from **21st-century threats**.]{.underline}

The bipartisan consensus on U.S. homeland missile defense policy for the
past several decades has been focused on a system that can defend
against limited threats from North Korea and, in the future as the
ranges of its missiles increase, possibly Iran. As such, the United
States has deployed 44 ground-based interceptors (GBIs) in California
and Alaska. The interceptors are designed to crash directly into enemy
offensive missiles in a technological feat that has been likened to
hitting a bullet with a bullet.

Forty-four interceptors may be sufficient for dealing with small salvos
from rogue states, but they would be easily overwhelmed by a larger
attack. Moreover, [the current system is]{.underline} [designed for
**ballistic missiles** and not a wider range of 21st-century threats,
which now includes **conventional** and **nuclear**-armed **cruise** and
**hypersonic missiles**.]{.underline}

Washington has long ruled out missile defenses against great powers like
China and Russia, arguing that it should instead rely only on nuclear
deterrence to prevent attacks from these peer adversaries. [Proponents
of this view argue that accepting mutual vulnerability
creates]{.underline} [**"**strategic stability**"**]{.underline} as both
sides understand they have too much to lose from a major war. They
contend that deploying strategic missile defenses could be
"destabilizing."

Adversaries fearing that U.S. missile defenses could stop their nuclear
deterrent might race to build enough missiles to overwhelm U.S.
defenses. Worse, they might fear that a strong defense gives America a
first-strike option, tempting adversaries to actually launch a
preemptive attack first in a crisis or war before their missiles are
wiped out.

[Unfortunately]{.underline}, [this approach of simply leaving the U.S.
homeland vulnerable to adversary strategic attack has **not led to
stability**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [backed by **nuclear
coercion**,]{.underline} [Russia has launched the biggest **land war**
in **Europe**]{.underline} [since **World War II.**]{.underline}
Meanwhile, [China has embarked on the **biggest nuclear arms
buildup**]{.underline} [since the height of the Cold War, harasses U.S.
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific daily, and **continues** to
**threaten** **military force** to **take over Taiwan**.]{.underline}

In addition, [Moscow and Beijing]{.underline} apparently did not get the
memo that building missile defense systems is destabilizing; they [have
both built and are now modernizing air and missile]{.underline}
**[defense systems]{.underline}** to protect their homelands from
attack, including from the United States.

At the same time, [both powers are building a **range** of **advanced
offensive** missiles that pose]{.underline} **[a vital
threat]{.underline}** to the United States. In sum, the [current
approach is not working, and]{.underline} [Washington needs to **take
action** to protect itself and to **restore strategic deterrence**
globally.]{.underline}

[The need for **missile defense** becomes clearer if one **imagines** a
**great-power war over** **Taiwan**.]{.underline} Take this scenario:
[China invades Taiwan]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the United States
mobilizes forces to come to the defense of the island. [China then
launches two dozen conventional hypersonic]{.underline} and cruise
**[missiles]{.underline}** **[at U.S. bases and cities]{.underline}** in
Guam, Hawaii, California, and Texas.

Given that the current U.S. system was designed for limited ballistic
missile threats, most, if not all, of these missiles would get through
and hit their intended target. [Washington's ability to **project
power** forward in the **defense** of its allies **would be
degraded**]{.underline}, [and a U.S. president might decide to simply
**back down** rather than risk **any further loss** of American
life.]{.underline}

But it does not make sense to leave the homeland vulnerable to this kind
of attack as a matter of policy. After all, the first and most important
vital interest of any U.S. president is to defend the homeland.

Developing **[an Iron Dome]{.underline}** for the United States [could
**defeat** this kind of **attack**]{.underline}.

Building a perfect system that could stop a large-scale attack with
hundreds or thousands of Russian or Chinese nuclear-armed missiles may
be impossible---for now---but Washington should still design a more
limited system to protect key sites, such as military bases, critical
infrastructure, and the national capital region. Such a system would
take America's juiciest targets off the table for an enemy attack.

[Such a defense would also help **deter** an **enemy attack** in the
first place]{.underline}. [If China and Russia know that a **limited
attack**]{.underline} would likely be shot down, then they would face a
choice between going big or going home. [Going big]{.underline}, by
launching a massive attack on the United States, [could escalate into a
**major nuclear war**]{.underline}---one that would threaten their
leaders, nuclear forces, militaries, and war-supporting industries,
giving U.S. adversaries good reason not to attack at all.

In addition to defense and deterrence, an Iron Dome for the United
States would contribute to the assurance of allies. [South Korean
officials]{.underline} and experts, for example, [have asked me whether
the **U**nited **S**tates---as it becomes more **vulnerable** to
**missile threats**---may be less **willing** to defend **Seoul** in a
**crisis**.]{.underline}

[Lacking assurance]{.underline} from the United States, [South Korean
leaders could choose to take]{.underline} [matters into their **own
hands**]{.underline}, including doing things that would be contrary to
U.S. interests, such as [building their own **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} [and sparking a **nuclear arms race** in
Asia]{.underline}. [A U.S. Iron Dome system, on the other hand, would
**assure allies** that **Washington** can help in their **defense** and
**protect** its homeland at the **same time**.]{.underline}

[The logic for a U.S. Iron Dome is so strong, it is becoming the new
bipartisan consensus]{.underline}. The 2023 final report of
[the]{.underline} 12-person, bipartisan [Congressional Commission on the
Strategic Posture]{.underline} of the United States (a commission on
which I served) [**unanimously** recommended]{.underline} [that "\[t\]he
United States should develop and field **homeland**]{.underline} IAMD
\[integrated air and [missile defense]{.underline}\] [**capabilities**
that can]{.underline} **[deter]{.underline}** [and **defeat coercive
attacks** by **Russia** and **China**."]{.underline}

For decades, **[critics]{.underline}** [have argued that **missile
defenses** do not **work**]{.underline}, [but the facts have
changed]{.underline}. Missile defense technology has greatly improved in
recent years. The world has witnessed the remarkable success of Israel's
Iron Dome system, which successfully defended Israel against massive
Iranian salvos of missiles and drones in two attacks in April and
October of last year.

In tests, the United States' current GBIs have a roughly 50 percent
success rate. Moreover, it is possible to shoot multiple interceptors at
each incoming missile, bringing the chance of a successful interception
closer to 100 percent.

A [homeland missile defense system does **not need** to be **perfect**
to be **effective**]{.underline}. If there were a missile headed for my
house, I would take a 50 percent chance of a successful defense over the
0 percent chance without a missile shield. And again, [even an uncertain
chance of success would **contribute** to the **deterrence** of
**adversaries** and the **assurance** of **allies**.]{.underline}

Designers of the new U.S. Iron Dome architecture should pursue a layered
defense to maximize its effectiveness. As my colleague Rob Soofer writes
in a new Atlantic Council report, this should include an expanded set of
interceptors, perhaps to 100 or so. They can be reinforced by an
underlayer of SM-3s (a missile currently used in U.S. Aegis theater
missile defenses), Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense missiles, and
cruise missile defenses.

Finally, U.S. missile defenses should move to space. Trump's new order
directs the Pentagon to develop and deploy "proliferated space-based
interceptors." The laws of geometry and physics mean that it is easier
to intercept an incoming missile from space than from the ground.

A ground-based interceptor must attempt to hit an incoming missile in
its midcourse or descent phase, when the missile is moving fastest and
where it can potentially maneuver and release decoys to confuse the
defender. A space-based interceptor, on the other hand, can target a
missile in its most vulnerable boost phase as it struggles slowly upward
on a predictable trajectory to escape Earth's gravitational pull.

Reagan and his advisors understood this in the 1980s, prompting them to
envision the original Star Wars system. They were ahead of their time,
but technology has caught up. Elon Musk's SpaceX has drastically slashed
the cost of space launch, rendering a proliferated system of space-based
sensors and interceptors feasible and affordable. You cannot hit what
you cannot see, and a space-based sensor layer, along with ground-,
sea-, and air-based radars, would provide the best chance to detect
incoming enemy missiles.

It was Soviet fears that Moscow could not keep pace with Washington's
planned Star Wars system that helped lead to the peaceful conclusion of
the first Cold War, and the United States is positioned to outmatch
China or Russia in a missile defense competition in the second Cold War.

[Critics will argue that an Iron Dome for the United States will risk
kicking off a new **destabilizing arms race** with China and Russia. The
truth is China and Russia are already racing---producing new
**offensive** and **defensive missiles**---as Washington sits on the
sidelines.]{.underline}

[Yes, building an American Iron Dome will be costly, but]{.underline}
[it will be less expensive than a future **Chinese** or **Russian
strategic attack** on the U.S. homeland.]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates Navy currently operates 11
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, nine cruisers, and around 75
guided-missile destroyers -- but it [lacks a **type** of **vessel** that
could be **increasingly important** should it be required to operate in
the Arctic]{.underline}.

Since 2022, [the Pentagon has been warning that the U.S. needs more
icebreaker ships]{.underline}. The ice may be melting in the great white
North, but **[icebreakers]{.underline}** [are **still** **required** for
the U.S. to have **year-round access** to what is **likely** to be an
increasingly **contested region**.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} United States [Coast Guard]{.underline} -- which is
part of the Department of Homeland Security not the Department of
Defense -- [currently operates just two aging icebreakers.]{.underline}

[The problem was made **worse this past summer**]{.underline},
[when]{.underline} USCGC [Healy]{.underline} (WAGB-20), the largest and
most technologically advanced icebreaker, [was **taken** out of
**service due** to an **electrical fire.**]{.underline} [That forced the
**cancelation** of **two scientific missions** to the]{.underline}
[Arctic via the **Northwest Passage**]{.underline}. The other
icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10) -- which is like WAGB-20
homeported in Seattle -- is tasked to travel to McMurdo Station,
Antarctica, annually.

[A 2023 study]{.underline} (updated in July 2024) from the Congressional
Research Service [concluded that the U.S. requires at least **eight** or
**nine polar icebreakers**]{.underline}. As a stopgap, the Coast Guard
announced it would acquire a commercial icebreaker and station it in
Juneau, Alaska.

Melting Ice Makes the Problem Worse

This is not entirely a new problem, but it is one that climate change
could make worse. In early 2022, [the Pentagon **warned** that it
**required additional icebreakers**]{.underline}, especially as Russia
has put renewed interest in the Arctic region.

The melting ice has opened up new shipping routes that previously didn't
exist, while the region is rich in resources. To [protect U.S. interests
**may require deploying** **warships** to the **Arctic**]{.underline}
[-- and while the ice is melting, it does return in the winter,
necessitating the **need** for more **icebreakers**.]{.underline}

"[Strategically, icebreakers provide **persistent presence** in a way
that's not met by **anything** else in the **maritime
region**]{.underline}," Randy Kee, who had served as the senior advisor
for arctic security affairs with the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic
Security Studies, explained in a Pentagon report. "[Remember, the Arctic
is a maritime region, and icebreaking provides you **year-round access**
to be able **to go in the region."**]{.underline}

Without the icebreakers, the U.S. may "not be able to participate in the
opportunities opening up or protect its interests," the DoD further
warned.

#### Upgrading research capabilities by procuring [new icebreakers]{.underline} is key.

[A new report from the **National Academies** of
**Sciences**]{.underline}, Engineering, and Medicine [outlines the

Antarctic coast for [**research** on **critical aspects** of **global
ocean** and **climate systems**]{.underline}, [especially related to
**climate change**]{.underline}. [**Aging** **infrastructure** available
to U.S. researchers should be replaced and include a **new icebreaking
research vessel**]{.underline} [and other **equipment** that can support
continued and expanded **U.S. research and technological**
**interests**]{.underline}, says the new report.

[A robust U.S. **research presence** in these regions, which are some of
the harshest and most remote places on Earth, is essential for
**national security** and economic **interests**,]{.underline} the
report says. [It identifies three thematic scientific drivers --- global
**sea-level rise**, the **global carbon cycle**, and **changing
ecosystems**]{.underline} --- and related high-priority research
questions as justification for renewed investment in vital
infrastructure and programs in the near term, especially construction of
a Polar Class 3 Antarctica Research Vessel (ARV).

"[These areas of **scientific research** may be physically far away from
the U.S., but the **effects** of **climate change** on these areas and
their resources are felt close to home,"]{.underline} said Paula
Bontempi, dean of the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University
of Rhode Island, and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report.
"The U.S. is a leader in Antarctic and Southern Ocean research, and we
must make a continued commitment to understanding these large systems
that have national and global impacts."

The urgency of this research is increasing, as Antarctica's ice sheets
may be approaching a dangerous tipping point toward a prolonged period
of ice loss driven by climate change. Antarctica's 58 meters of
sea-level rise potential will have global-scale impacts, yet uncertainty
remains about rates and extent of ice mass loss and the long-term
trajectory of sea-level rise. The Southern Ocean is also where most deep
waters rise to exchange carbon with the atmosphere, and is responsible
for about 40% to 50% of the net removal of fossil fuel derived CO2
emissions. Thus, there is a need for scientists to better understand how
its carbon reservoir may change. The ecosystems in this region are also
uniquely adapted to extreme environments and perform important functions
that regulate the exchange of energy, nutrients, and carbon throughout
the area's food webs. Considerable uncertainty remains about how
ecosystems are responding to a changing climate and may impact important
natural systems that directly or indirectly benefit humans and global
economics.

The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is
charged with supporting Antarctic science and logistical operations.
However, the aging science infrastructure that serves the region will
not be able to support the research necessary to advance U.S. interests.
Without major and immediate investments, including urgent investment in
a new ARV, the U.S. will fall behind other nations in research that is
essential to national security, the report says.

"[The U.S. is already behind schedule in updating our scientific
infrastructure in the region, **especially** for **aging research
vessels**]{.underline}," said committee co-chair Alan Mix, distinguished
professor of earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences at Oregon State
University. "While the committee applauds the tentative commitment of
the U.S. government and NSF toward an ARV, [NSF must urgently move
forward with next steps to make a **new vessel** and other **needed
infrastructure** a reality]{.underline}."

Increased Demand for Icebreakers

The diversity of potential situations in which icebreakers might be
employed must also continue to be considered in acquisition planning. As
of 2020, [the United States' polar icebreakers conduct **primarily two
missions**]{.underline}. [The first is **scientific
research**,]{.underline} [performed together with the National Science
Foundation and other partners: Understanding polar environments is
important in **characterizing global weather** and]{.underline}
**[oceanographic patterns]{.underline}**, [as well as how these **are**
**changing over time**]{.underline}. [The second mission is
resupply]{.underline}, primarily [for **research stations**
in]{.underline} Antarctica but also for [remote **Alaskan
communities**]{.underline}. For example, during the winter of
2011--2012, the medium icebreaker Healy enabled a tanker to deliver
critical fuel supplies to the city of Nome, Alaska. In addition, [these
cutters have **enabled presence** and **readiness** for possible polar
**contingencies**, such as **search-and-rescue events**]{.underline};
the Healy was present for parts of the Crystal Serenity's historic
transit of a large cruise ship from Seward, Alaska, to New York through
the Northwest Passage with 1,700 passengers and crew members aboard
(Rosen, 2016).

[All signs point to an increased demand for the Coast Guard's missions
in the coming decades]{.underline} and potentially expanding roles for
these cutters. [**Scientists** need to **conduct research** on **polar
climate conditions** to increase their understanding of regional
influence on the rest of the world. Foreign and domestic commercial
interests will continue to]{.underline} [explore the polar regions in
search of shorter **transit times** for vessels; **extraction** of
**resources**, such as **minerals**, **oil**, and **fish**; and
**tourism**]{.underline}. Some of this monitoring can be done from the
air or via satellite. For the next several decades, however, [human
beings will still need to **actively** **collect** and **evaluate
samples** from the **polar regions**]{.underline}. In addition, demand
for resupply and even rescue may grow as the poles become more
accessible thanks to reduced summer ice cover, contributing to increased
human activity in the region. As this occurs, U.S. policy requires the
Coast Guard to maintain a capability to oversee national interests by
executing its statutory missions.

Furthermore, U.S. interests and maritime mission demands in the Arctic
and Antarctic will always differ from each other because of immutable
geographic considerations: The Antarctic is a land mass surrounded by
water, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, including the
U.S. state of Alaska. The Arctic contains permanent populations, some of
whom have lived there for millennia, as well as resource extraction that
dates back decades. Although the region has some diplomatically managed
maritime boundary disputes, almost all of its lands are unambiguously
part of specific nations. On the other hand, the Antarctic and its
surrounding oceans have no permanent inhabitants and no commercial
activity except fishing and are subject to unrecognized claims by
various nations. The absence of commercial activity may change because
the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty that forbid resource extraction
in the region (Argentina et al., 1961) are open to revision in 2048,
well within the lifetime of future polar icebreakers. [If **extraction**
of **oil** or **minerals** led to disaster, U.S. **icebreakers** might
be **needed to help respond**.]{.underline}

Searching for \"cold hard\" proof of global warming? Look no further
than the melting ice of the Arctic. Warming twice as fast as the rest of
the planet, the region is recognized as a frontline for climate change.
With potential global implications, the thaw begs the question: Do we
know what pathogens lie in wait underground?

[Imagine the **next pandemic** developing from **harmful microbes
present** within **permafrost**]{.underline}, [part of the long-frozen
Arctic terrain]{.underline}. [This scenario may sound like science
fiction but is an **all-too-real threat**.]{.underline}

[In 2016, for example, 13 people in Siberia became ill from anthrax
spores linked to the thawed carcass of a reindeer that died 75 years
prior.]{.underline} [**Surveillance systems** do exist]{.underline} [to
monitor such incidents as **disease** presents in people]{.underline}.
But [no system exists to **detect pathogens** in the **environment**
before **diseases strike**.]{.underline}

\"Essentially, we know when people get sick, but we don't always know
the locations where people were exposed,\" says MITRE epidemiologist
Alex Wu. He led a MITRE research team in taking the first step toward
developing a more proactive approach to battling diseases that could
emerge from permafrost.

[Our experts reviewed the state of the science of current efforts to
surveil pathogens in the Arctic]{.underline}. [They identified a
**significant gap** in **understanding** where potentially **dangerous**
**microorganisms** may **reside in permafrost**]{.underline}. [And they
demonstrated how **pathogens** could be **mapped to alert public health
officials** to their presence **before people fall ill**.]{.underline}

\"[We need an **integrated system** that combines the information from
permafrost thaw, climate prediction models, human activity, soil
microbial data, and locations of human and animal
remains]{.underline},\" Wu explains. \"[This will be vital to the next
**phase** of **fighting diseases** at their **origin** to **prevent
their spread**.\"]{.underline}

The icy Arctic has long been home to myriad pathogens. While frozen,
these pose no risk to human health. But [increasing human engagement in
the region means as temperatures increase,]{.underline} [so does
**people's risk** of **harmful exposure**]{.underline}. From indigenous
populations and oil pipeline staff to U.S. military personnel, those
living and working in this remote territory may become vulnerable.

Wu, formerly an epidemic intelligence service officer for the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has long held a
fascination with the Arctic area. In his youth, he spent many summers
visiting Alaska with family friends---and became fascinated with its
beauty.

When he came to MITRE in 2021 and learned of our independent R&D
program, it prompted a proposal to explore the question: \"[How can we
prepare for another pandemic-type pathogen that could blindside us from
other regions, such as the far North?\"]{.underline}

[Why icebreakers?]{.underline}

The Wilson Center argues that [**icebreakers** are a **critical starting
point** for reviving U.S. **shipbuilding**.]{.underline} While the U.S.
has only a handful of operational icebreakers, Russia has over 40 in
service, and China continues expanding its polar fleet.

Beyond military needs, [**global demand** for **icebreakers** is
**growing**]{.underline}, [with U.S. allies projected to purchase
between **70 and 90 icebreakers**]{.underline} in the next decade. [If
U.S. shipyards can **scale up production** and **compete
internationally**, they could **break** into a growing **market** and
**re-establish America's reputation** as a **global
shipbuilder**.]{.underline}

The ICE Pact, a trilateral initiative with Finland and Canada, is
designed to help U.S. shipyards enter this market while strengthening
Arctic security. If successful, [it could serve]{.underline} [as a model
for **larger-scale** U.S. **shipbuilding reforms**.]{.underline}

A call to action

The Wilson Center's report presents a stark warning: [Without urgent
reforms, the U.S. will continue to fall further **behind** in
**shipbuilding capacity**]{.underline}, [**industrial competitiveness**
and **Arctic security**.]{.underline}

By developing a national shipbuilding strategy, modernizing acquisition
rules, and implementing stronger trade protections, the U.S. can rebuild
its maritime power and compete with China's state-backed shipbuilding
dominance.

### 2AC\-\--AT: ICE Pact Solves

#### The plan is key\-\--the US has only paid lip service to Ice Breakers now, but the plan is key to ensuring success

[Polar Icebreakers May Be Key to Jumpstarting American Shipbuilding New
Report Finds]{.underline}

The recently-signed ICE Pact, focused on the development of icebreakers,
represents a unique opportunity to revitalize American shipbuilding, a
new report by the Wilson Center, a think tank, finds. [It could
**function** as a **test-bed** for **shipbuilding** and **policy
innovation**.]{.underline}

"If successful, ICE Pact will serve as a model for how government
procurement programs for military vessels can act as an important tool
of industrial policy to help U.S. shipyards sell vessels to a wider
array of customers," the report concludes.

U.S. shipyards face a formidable challenge to revitalize American
shipbuilding and seapower in a world increasingly dominated by Chinese
shipbuilders. Shipyards in China accounted for 75 percent of new
commercial ship orders in 2024.

A key headwind for U.S. builders are the complex acquisition and
contracting rules combined with the lack of long-term funding stability.
The ICE Pact, short for Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, between the
U.S., Canada, and Finland looks to combine the strengths and
capabilities of their respective shipyards.

"[The **ICE Pact** is the **start** of a **procurement-to-production
on-ramp** that will help bend]{.underline} downwards the cost of
building ships in America," says William Henagan, one of the report's
authors and technical advisor at the Wilson Center's Polar Institute.

[**Polar icebreakers** can help **overcome American shipbuilding
inertia**]{.underline}, according to the report. Apart from the fact
that the U.S. is in dire need of a dozen or more heavy and medium
icebreakers, the vessels' high-tech and complex nature represents an
opportunity to rebuilding American shipbuilding competitiveness in high
quality vessels, rather than attempting to compete with China on
low-tech, low-value vessels.

[**Thus** far **procurement** and lead-up to construction]{.underline}
[of the Polar Security Cutter]{.underline}, [as the Coast Guard's **new
heavy icebreaker** is called, has been **anything but
smooth**]{.underline}, with more than half a decade passing from
contract signing to the first steel being cut.

[**But** a **clear signal** from the **U.S. government** for the
**procurement** of a **fleet** of **icebreakers** in the **present can
help put American shipyards**]{.underline} [in a position to participate
in the market for a growing **global demand** of
**icebreakers**]{.underline} -- [estimated between **70-90 -- in the
future**]{.underline}. [And in the medium-term that new expertise
could]{.underline} [translate to **competing** for **international**
military and **commercial dual-purpose vessels.**]{.underline}

President Trump recently stated that the U.S. will be looking to order
40 big icebreakers for the Coast Guard. [**Even** a firm **commitment**
and **funding** for a fraction of this **lofty goal** would send a **key
signal**.]{.underline}

"[**Sustained U.S. government focus** on the **production** of
**vessels** like **icebreakers**]{.underline}, undersea construction
vessels, unmanned underwater vehicles, and undersea cable and repair
ships [remains the **clearest route** to putting near-term '**points
on-the-board**]{.underline}," the Wilson Center report highlights.

"[The **best tool** we have today to **strengthen** the **shipbuilding
industrial base** in America]{.underline} **[is
procurement]{.underline}**, but we also need new government investment,
adjustment to trade policy, and changes in labor policy. We need to
force military service branches to think about industrial policy --- not
just following bureaucratic procedures to put warships on the water,"
Henagan concludes.

#### ICE PACT fails to create American made ships, that's key to solve shipbuilding.

[But as they approach the massive task of **rebuilding** America's
maritime strength, **policymakers** face **uncomfortable choices**. Do
**they prioritise ships**, or **shipbuilding**?]{.underline} [The
fastest way to acquire **new vessels** is to **order** from **allied**
**countries**]{.underline} [such as **South Korea** and
**Japan**]{.underline}, which boast the strongest shipbuilding
industries outside China. [Investing in domestic shipbuilding, by
contrast, would create **far more jobs** and help **restore** the
**country's industrial base**, but would take much **longer** to
**accomplish**.]{.underline}

How the administration resolves this dilemma will have drastic
implications for global trade and geopolitics.

Breaking the ice

[As the US begins the journey towards **reviving its shipbuilding
industry**, **icebreakers are top of the to-do list**.]{.underline}

[In the icebreaker industry, however, it is not China that occupies top
position --- but Finland.]{.underline} The Nordic nation's prowess with
icebreakers is perhaps not surprising, given that its ports freeze solid
each winter. Today, Finland designs 80% of the world's icebreakers and
builds more than 60%.

[The sudden surge in US interest in icebreakers could therefore provide
an enormous boon for Finnish industry.]{.underline}

"I have never seen this level of interest in icebreakers globally," says
Mika Hovilainen, CEO of Aker Arctic, a Finnish company that designs and
tests icebreakers. It is a time of "dramatic change" in the industry, he
explains. Finland's shipyards lost one of their leading customers when
it became unacceptable to deliver vessels to Russia after it invaded
Ukraine. But demand for icebreakers on the other side of the Atlantic
could more than compensate for this loss.

Finland's expertise with icebreakers was one of the arguments used to
justify its admission to Nato in 2023. [Last July, the US and Canada
agreed to establish an Icebreaker Collaboration Effort --- known as the
**ICE Pact** --- with **Finland**, in which the three countries will
co-operate in **sharing expertise** and **resources**.]{.underline}

[**It remains** to be seen if Mr **Trump** will **fully support the ICE
Pact**]{.underline}. [Collaborating with allies may seem to contradict
his '**America First'** **philosophy**]{.underline}. [Indeed, in
announcing]{.underline} [his plan for 48 new US icebreakers]{.underline}
in March, [the president took a potshot against Canada, a **country** he
**hopes to annex**.]{.underline}

"We're going to order 48, and Canada wants to be part of the deal," said
Mr Trump. "I say, 'You got to get your own icebreakers. I mean, if
you're a state, you can be part of the deal, but if you're a separate
country, you've got to get your own icebreakers.'"

Collaboration

Mr [Trump has been **more positive** about the **US relationship** with
**Finland**]{.underline}, however. In late March, he hosted Finnish
president Alexander Stubb for a game of golf, posting on social media
afterwards that the US and Finland would work together on the "purchase
and development" of icebreakers.

[Ordering icebreakers directly from Finland would **require a change to
regulations** that]{.underline} [require US Navy and Coast Guard
**vessels** to be **built domestically**]{.underline}. Finland's ICE
Pact coordinator Reko-Antti Suojanen tells fDi Intelligence that a
"relaxation" in these regulations is "the only way to come to our common
goals."

[There is support in the US Congress for reforms that would allow the US
to work with allies to speed-up naval construction]{.underline}.
Republican senators Mike Lee and John Curtis introduced legislation in
February that would allow the US Navy and Coast Guard to order vessels
from allied countries, if the cost is cheaper than it would be from a US
shipyard.

[But these **proposals** will have to **contend with fears** that
**closer collaboration could** **further weaken** the **US shipbuilding
industry**.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [Canada and Finland have been working collaboratively since
even before]{.underline} [the **ICE Pact** was **signed**]{.underline}.
Helsinki Shipyard, a world leader in icebreaker construction, was
acquired by Canada-based Group Davie in 2023, having previously been
under Russian ownership. In March, the Canadian government awarded a
C\$3.25bn (\$2.27bn) heavy icebreaker contract to Davie. Construction
will begin at Helsinki Shipyard and be completed at Lévis in Quebec.

The project will be "an excellent showcase of what can be achieved if
there is a well-functioning national co-operation in place", says Kim
Salmi, managing director of Helsinki Shipyard.

He adds that his company has "unique expertise" in icebreaker
construction. "No other shipyard in the world has delivered as many
icebreaking vessels as we have."

"We are also able to build ice-going vessels with the fastest schedule
on the market, in 36 months or quicker depending on requirements."

#### Access to the Arctic is impossible without icebreakers, but America's fleet is [small and unreliable]{.underline}, and the US hasn't built a new icebreaker in decades.

The annual 'Operation Deep Freeze' is one of the world's great feats of

sight** in **icy waters** of the **Arctic**]{.underline} and Antarctic.
[The **Polar Star** is the **only operational heavy icebreaker** that
the United States **Coast Guard possesses**.]{.underline}

"[The US has a **very small fleet** of icebreakers, **one heavy** and
**two medium**, and they're **old** and really spend a **lot of time in
maintenance**]{.underline}," says Cynthia Cook, director of the
Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS). "[We have **relatively few** --- **fewer
than we need."**]{.underline}

Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [agrees]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
[US president plans to order 48 **icebreakers** to help dramatically
**expand** the US **presence** in the increasingly contested **polar
regions.**]{.underline} Russia already has world-leading icebreaker
capabilities, while China is taking a growing interest in the Arctic and
its mineral riches.

[But **no American shipyard** has **built** a **heavy icebreaker in
decades**]{.underline}. [A programme to construct three such vessels,
known as Polar Security Cutters, was approved in Mr Trump's first term,
but is **years behind schedule** and **significantly over
budget**.]{.underline}

[This reflects a **much wider malaise** in **American**
**shipbuilding**]{.underline}. The US built 5% of the world's
ocean-going commercial ships in the 1970s. Today, the figure is 0.1%.
The protectionist Jones Act of 1920, which requires vessels sailing
between US ports to be built domestically, has done little to help US
shipbuilding remain globally significant.

Most importantly, [the US has **failed** to **build up** its **domestic
icebreaker capacity**]{.underline}, nor has it begun developing related
naval capabilities that would allow it to actively contest and contain
the rapid Russian and Chinese buildup along the Arctic sea lanes.

And it has done remarkably little, until lately, to support its friends
in the Arctic with respect to infrastructure investment support. The US,
for example, has no Arctic deepwater ports to host heavy container
ships. Canada has only one, lying 500 miles south of the Arctic Circle.

[Even though Russia now has over 40 icebreakers]{.underline}, **[several
of nuclear-powered]{.underline}**, and an active building program, [the
United States presently lacks even a single heavy or **medium-duty
icebreaker** active in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. US icebreaker
capacity, such as it is, is concentrated entirely in the Great Lakes.

[The]{.underline} July, **[2024 ICE agreement]{.underline}** with Canada
and Finland, concluded at the 2024 Washington NATO summit, [does **begin

fashion**.]{.underline} [Yet the **massive deficiency** in America's own
icebreaker capacity, rooted in the **striking weaknesses** of its own

The Polar Icebreaker Market can be segmented by end-users into five
primary categories: Government Agencies, Research Institutions, Shipping
Companies, Energy and Resource Companies, and Tour Operators. Each of
these segments plays a pivotal role in the utilization and demand for
**[icebreakers]{.underline}**, [which serve as **essential vessels** for
**navigation** through **icy waters**]{.underline}. Government Agencies
include national and regional bodies responsible for icebreaker
operations for strategic maritime purposes, search and rescue missions,
and enforcement of sovereign rights over territorial waters in polar
regions. [These **agencies** often invest in **advanced icebreakers** to
enhance national security and **support scientific
missions**.]{.underline} [Research Institutions **utilize icebreakers**
for **scientific research** in **polar environments**, facilitating
**oceanographic studies**, **climate** change **research**, and
**ecological surveys**.]{.underline}

[These institutions depend on icebreakers to **transport researchers**
and **equipment** to **remote locations**]{.underline}, [where
**access** is **otherwise challenging**]{.underline}. Shipping Companies
have a growing interest in icebreakers for facilitating shipping routes
that are becoming more navigable due to climate change, particularly in
the Arctic. These companies seek to shorten transit times and enhance
safety in icy waters. Energy and Resource Companies leverage icebreakers
to access and transport resources like oil and gas in Arctic regions,
where the reliable deployment of icebreakers is crucial for the
development of offshore resources. Tour Operators increasingly use
icebreakers for eco-tourism endeavors, providing unique travel
experiences in polar regions, which adds a recreational angle to the
market. By addressing the needs of these diverse end-users, the Polar
Icebreaker Market reflects a multifaceted demand that is essential for
navigation, research, and resource extraction in harsh environments.

"The position of the United States upon the two oceans would be either a
source of great weakness or a cause of enormous expense." When Alfred
Thayer Mahan penned these words, Alaska was not yet a state and the
Arctic was still a vast icescape. But now Mahan's predictions must
undergo a twenty-first-century update to account for the arrival of the
third frontier: a blue Arctic. [As ice melts, **new trade routes will
emerge**,]{.underline} [resources **long hidden beneath** the **ice**
will become **accessible**]{.underline}, [and a new strategic
**battleground** will **emerge** at the **top of the

While Earth's climate is changing at a faster pace than ever before,
climatic episodes over the past two thousand years---like the Roman
Climate Optimum (200 BCE--150 CE), the Little Antique Ice Age (300
CE--700 CE), the Medieval warming period (950 CE--1250), and the Little
Ice Age (1350--1850)---offer important perspective. In this era of
human-influenced climate change, these periods tell us that climate
change does not always spell disaster. Indeed, studies of these periods
tell us that climate influences the conduct or outcome of war rather
than determining it. Our modern era of climate change can certainly
exacerbate vulnerabilities for those militaries who ignore it; but for
those who most capture the winds of history into the sails of their
respective war machines, it can provide strategic opportunities.

Climate can influence who you fight, what you fight over, when you fight
and where, and perhaps most importantly, why you fight. Changing Arctic
conditions demand strategists consider those five W's in a
twenty-first-century context. Before 2050, the United States, Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland must assess how the diminishing
North Pole ice wall will transform into blue borders accessible not only
to trade, but also to other strategic competitors, like Russia and
China. **[The importance]{.underline}** [of such considerations could
hardly be overstated]{.underline}: [**Arctic flashpoints** include vast
**mineral resources**, largely untapped **oil and gas reserves**, and
disputes over **sovereignty** within **exclusive economic zones** and
resultant **trade wars**]{.underline}. In the past, such considerations
have only been necessary in the summer months (except for submarine and
long-range air assets), when climate conditions were most hospitable to
both land and sea forces. [Yet melting ice is projected to allow for
year-round naval and **commercial shipping competition** as early as
**2050**]{.underline}---with sea trade via the region expected to double
by 2035. [Compared to the Panama and Suez Canals, the Northern Sea Route
offers significantly **reduced transit times**---and with it, **fuel
costs**---thus rendering it perhaps the most **lucrative alternative**
to traditional **shipping lanes**.]{.underline}

But why reallocate resources from our present strategic footprint?
Simply put, the Arctic is quickly evolving into the new dance floor for
geopolitical competition (including, in its most extreme manifestation,
warfare), replete with all the classic Thucydidean trappings of fear,
honor, and interest. This is not an exaggeration: Russia and China have
already signaled their desire for Arctic dominance. With the world's
largest icebreaker fleet, Russia poses the most dominant and formidable
force in the region. Russia has seized the strategic and operational
advantage, maintaining near-continuous operations in the Arctic,
sharpening firsthand experience in the seascape, and challenging any
foreign militaries who dare transit these frigid waters. Not far behind
Russia, China---the self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---has similarly
declared itself a regional force. China has invested heavily in its
Polar Silk Road, thus expanding its maritime and global spheres of
influence and all but guaranteeing strategic and economic returns in the
region.

US Arctic Strategy

In recent years, DoD's Arctic Strategy has undergone considerable review
and revision. Indeed, current policy is drastically different from the
policies of a decade ago. These new strategic visions no doubt have
heightened our awareness of the Arctic's growing geopolitical
importance, and these policies are not without their strengths. But our
most recent strides leave one wondering: Are we doing enough? The United
States is an Arctic nation, but does our strategic policy fully reflect
this? Current US strategy acknowledges, for example, the Arctic is not
just warming---it's becoming a new arena for strategic competition. In
this light, the strategy's "monitor-and-respond" approach reads as both
too passive and too reactive for the competitive contest likely to
develop in the far north. While we recognize the innate importance of
robust monitoring and other intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities in the region, we also acknowledge that
China and Russia are already conducting combined exercises off the coast
of Alaska. Considered in this light, our monitor-and-respond strategy
resembles the military equivalent of relying on a giant Ring camera:
it's great for observation, but insufficient for deterring adversaries
and projecting power.

More alarming still, the United States lags woefully behind her fellow
great powers in Arctic preparations. By the time the United States
published its first radical transformation of Arctic strategic policy,
it was decades, even centuries, behind Russia's interest in the
region---an interest that transformed into action by the 2000s.
Likewise, China has been honing its Arctic intentions since 2013, when
it gained "observer" status in the Arctic Council. The following year,
Russia created its Arctic Joint Strategic Command, and just three years
after that, declared its plans to "phase NATO out of the Arctic." By
2018, China published its first Arctic policy white paper, and shortly
after launched its first domestically built icebreaker. In 2023, Russia
declared the Arctic its second priority---a priority Moscow is well
positioned to promote with its already robust Arctic presence and
operating bases. Two of the world's most powerful militaries have
signaled their intent to establish strategic, diplomatic, and economic
dominance of the world's smallest ocean. Can the United States really
afford to simply monitor and respond?

We recognize this call to action is not without significant obstacles.
As our most current Arctic Strategy rightly points out, we must "balance
against other DoD global commitments"---and we have to determine how to
do this in an environment replete with fiscal, structural,
environmental, and manpower challenges. We are not suggesting that DoD
abandon our global commitments in favor of Arctic operations. We are
arguing, however, that the department cannot abandon Arctic power
projection in favor of keeping global commitments. It will be hard. It
will stretch our forces and our capabilities. But it is worth
remembering that Russia is doing both. China is doing both. And
increasingly, they are doing both together---including in back-to-back
naval exercises in 2022 and 2023 off the coast of Alaska. Accordingly,
we must do both, and we must start now. US Arctic strategy and policy
must shift from a future-oriented mindset of what we will do when time
and resources allow to an ethos of what we are doing now, lest we look
back in 2030 or 2050 at what we should've, could've, or would've done
differently to prepare for a blue Arctic. In this light, aiming
principally to "manage risk in the region" is not an acceptable
substitute for establishing presence. The United States must take action
now to ensure we are prepared to successfully maintain peace and
prosperity in the blue Arctic.

Policy Recommendations

We do not diminish the immense difficulties the United States faces in
implementing such active---but vital---strategic and operational
postures. Establishing a presence in the Arctic and also maintaining
presence and capability in other global regions with US interests at
stake will stretch our manpower and our assets. But [we argue our stated
objectives can be achieved in the following ways:]{.underline}

1\. Increase year-round air, land, surface, and subsurface operations in
the Arctic now. We can ill afford, as the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy puts
it, to "explore options to improve mobility in all seasons and variable
conditions across the Arctic's diverse geography and weather" when our
adversaries are already past the exploratory and into the operational
phase. The Arctic is a highly dynamic operational environment that
forces even the most seasoned DoD operators to perform familiar tasks in
new ways. We must practice these tasks in adverse conditions now.

2\. Assess manpower and other resource alignment against the full range
of US global interests and ensure the Arctic is appropriately resourced.
Based on the findings, DoD should be prepared to consider an increase in
the size of the US military while simultaneously ramping up sustained
year-round Arctic operations.

3\. [Build or obtain more polar-capable icebreakers now. Russia's
icebreaker fleet far exceeds ours]{.underline}. [Indeed, even our
"**near-Arctic**" peer competitor, China, has more. **Expanding the
icebreaker fleet** will ensure **year-round access** **to** and presence
in **Arctic waters**.]{.underline}

COUNTERING COERCIVE ATTACKS FROM CHINA AND RUSSIA

Even as the United States adapts to the dynamic **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rean ICBM threat, [**China** and **Russia** are
building the **missile**-based **forces** necessary to **threaten the
US** homeland at or **below** the **nuc**lear **threshold** to
**enable** their strategies of **coercion** and theories of military
**victory**]{.underline}. Since the United States has eschewed
developing homeland missile defenses of any kind designed to defeat
Chinese or Russian missile threats (except for a limited cruise missile
defense of the national capital region), [China]{.underline} and Russia
appear to [view this **perceived vulnerability** as an opportunity to
successfully deter, **coerce**, or ultimately **defeat US** efforts to
project **power** overseas]{.underline}.

According to some US experts, "Moscow and Beijing appear now to
calculate that their respective threats to escalate to limited nuclear
war will be sufficient to paralyze direct US opposition to their
regional expansionism."16 This may include dual-use capabilities to
attack the foundation of the US national defense strategy: power
projection from the homeland. The "2022 Nuclear Posture Review"
recognizes this problem, stating that the United States must prepare to
deter large-scale and limited nuclear use from its nuclear-armed
adversaries, especially in light of the increasing reliance on the
coercive threat of limited nuclear use in these states' strategies.17
More recently, Lt. Gen. Gregory Guillot, nominated to be the new
commander of US Northern Command, told Congress in July that the Defense
Department should consider expanding current national missile defense
policy to also counter coercive attacks on the United States by China or
Russia.18 There appears to be growing support for this approach, as the
bipartisan US Strategic Posture Commission reached consensus recently
and recommended that the "United States should develop and field
homeland \[integrated air and missile defense\] capabilities that can
deter and defeat coercive attacks by Russia and China."19

[Deterring **coercive nuc**lear strikes or **conventional strikes** with
strategic effects against the homeland **requires**]{.underline} a
combination of appropriate conventional forces, nuclear forces, and
[**m**issile **d**efenses]{.underline}. The missile defense review (MDR)
of 2022 notes that [**regional** missile **defenses** can help the
**U**nited **S**tates deter or defend against **limited nuc**lear
**use** by effectively making the **risks** and potential **costs**
of]{.underline} smaller-scale nuclear [coercion appear
**unacceptable**]{.underline}; there is no reason this concept cannot
also extend to the defense of the homeland.20 While China or Russia
could, in theory, simply overwhelm a US homeland missile defense system
designed to defend against coercive attacks, [the **larger** the
**attack** size needed]{.underline} to overcome US defenses, [the **more
China** or **Russia** run the risk that the **U**nited **S**tates
**perceives** the motivations behind the **attack** as **unlimited** and
**responds accordingly**]{.underline}. Additionally, the larger the
attack size needed to overcome US homeland missile defenses, the better
the chance the United States could detect attack preparations and take
the appropriate measures to improve its defense posture.

[Given]{.underline} the sheer variety of [Chinese and Russia missile
**delivery systems**]{.underline} ([**cruise**, ballistic,
**hypersonic** glide vehicles, fractional **orbital**
systems]{.underline}, and other potential combinations), [the
question]{.underline} naturally [is: **what** kind of US homeland
**missile defenses** are most **needed** to deter and defeat coercive
threats**?**]{.underline} If one of the US objectives is to be able to
intercept a handful of Chinese or Russian ballistic missiles, then the
[current **homeland defense**]{.underline} architecture [could
**potentially** be **sufficient if** it is **upgraded**]{.underline} to
address their more sophisticated reentry vehicles armed with decoys and
countermeasures. To address these countermeasures, the Department of
Defense must improve the tracking and discriminating of warheads, likely
from space. If the GBI/NGI can sense Russian and Chinese reentry
vehicles and distinguish them from decoys, with the help of space-based
sensors, then it may have a reasonably good chance to complete the
intercept, even against these more sophisticated targets.

\"'Golden Dome for America' rekindles debate over missile defenses.\"
Washington Examiner. 3-14-2025.
<https://archive.ph/pkz3X#selection-1321.0-1321.14> HDCSW-Packet

President Donald Trump has been inspired by Israel's Iron Dome defense
against short-range rockets to build something grander, akin to former
President Ronald Reagan's "Strategic Defense Initiative" --- dubbed
"Star Wars" by 1980s critics for its fanciful concept of shooting down
incoming missiles with space-based lasers.

[In terms of developing a **working missile shield**]{.underline}, [Star
Wars was a flop]{.underline}, [although it did lead to technologies that
helped produce today's **effective battlefield systems**]{.underline}
and spook the Russians enough to contribute to the United States winning
the Cold War.

In the decade between its birth in 1983 and its scrapping by
then-President Bill Clinton in 1993, the SDI program ate up \$30 billion
without any of the systems under development ever coming remotely close
to deployment.

"[Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't
there, not even close,]{.underline}" Trump said in his March 4 address
to Congress. "[But]{.underline} [now we **have the
technology**]{.underline}. It's incredible, actually.

"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile
defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA. This is a
very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected. And
we're going to protect our citizens like never before."

Trump's executive order giving the Pentagon two months to submit an
implementation plan for "the next-generation missile defense shield,"
was titled "The Iron Dome for America." But it has since been rebranded
as "Golden Dome," given that Israel's Iron Dome is an area defense
system effective against rockets, artillery, and mortars, not
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the name "Iron Dome" happens to
be trademarked by Israel's Rafael, which builds the short-range system
in partnership with Raytheon.

[**Trump is correct** that **missile defense technology** has **greatly
advanced** in the three decades since Reagan's Star Wars concept was
jettisoned.]{.underline}

["We can **hit a bullet with a bullet**]{.underline}," says Tom Karako,
who heads up the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "[It's **routine**. It's **not news** anymore. We
just have to pick what part of the bullet we want to hit. It's
first]{.underline} [appreciating and coming to grips with the nature of
the **threat** and **prioritizing** it. And that's why I think this
**Iron Dome initiative** is **quite welcome**."]{.underline}

Roughly \$200 billion later, [the U.S. now has the **most advanced
missile defenses** in the world]{.underline} --- [ranging from the
**ground-based interceptors** based in Alaska]{.underline}, [designed to
counter a]{.underline} nuclear attack from North Korea, to the Aegis
systems and [**SM-3 missiles** on Navy ships, to the Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense system]{.underline}, and to Patriot batteries,
which have proven to be the most effective systems deployed in Ukraine.

[Those systems and other **related missile defense programs** cost about
**\$10 billion annually.**]{.underline}

But Trump's grandiose vision of an impregnable dome protecting the
entire continental U.S. from "any foreign aerial attack" is drawing the
same derisive epithets missile defense skeptics have been voicing for
years --- words like "boondoggle," "pipe dream," and "pie in the sky."

"Trump wants an outline of such a system, including warning satellites,
space-based sensors, and orbiting interceptors, to detect, track, and
destroy any incoming aerial threats by, um, April 1," writes Mark
Thompson, a veteran defense reporter and sharp-tongued blogger for the
Project on Government Oversight. "You don't have to be a rocket
scientist to know such a multi-layered system is beyond the reach of
mere mortals."

"The Iron Dome plan to erect a ballistic missile defense across the
entire country is an impractical boondoggle that could cost as much as
\$100 billion annually, i.e., more than 10% of the entire defense
budget," historian and defense analyst Max Boot writes in the Washington
Post. Even making allowances for Trump's trademark hyperbole, a serious
problem remains: Despite all the technological developments of the past
four decades, building a missile defense shield over our entire country
is no more practical today than it was in 1983, Boot concludes.

"President Trump's vision of an Iron Dome over America is a fantasy,"
argues Laura Grego, a senior scientist for the Global Security Program
at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Invoking Iron Dome is just
marketing, trying to manufacture credibility for something that has
never worked.

"Russia and China already appear to be building new types of weapons
with the purpose of defeating or avoiding missile defenses. Missile
defenses are not a useful or long-term strategy for keeping the U.S.
safe from nuclear weapons."

Still the Defense Department, to the cheers of the defense industry, is
saluting and stepping out smartly.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth included the Golden Dome among the
high-priority programs that he's shielding from budget cuts as he aims
to realign military spending with Trump's priorities.

"Iron Dome, or Golden Dome, whatever you want to call it, we have
embraced the executive order of President Trump," Hegseth said on Fox
News last month. "We're going to ensure it's included in reconciliation
money, in the FY26 \[budget\], all our budgets going forward, to invest
in the ability to get this novel idea to defend our homeland."

"Unsurprisingly, defense contractors like what they're hearing,"
Thompson wrote, noting that the day after Trump's announcement, Chris
Calio, chief executive of RTX, parent of Raytheon, the Pentagon's
second-biggest contractor, was all in.

"Layered integrated air and missile defense systems are core to us,"
Calio said on an earnings call with reporters. "It's the bedrock of
Raytheon, and they are among the best at it. We view this as a
significant opportunity for us, something right in our wheelhouse."

"[**The critics** are **too caught up** in the **hype**]{.underline},
[instead of focusing on the reality that the U.S. is falling behind on
defenses against a **new generation of threats** including **hypersonic
cruise** **missiles**]{.underline}," argued Karako, at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.

"[The beginning of wisdom is to honor the threat and to acknowledge that
you can't defend everything,"]{.underline} Karako told The Cipher Brief
in a March 4 interview. "That's not possible. There's just too much
stuff. The Iron Dome moniker is really just a metaphor. It's not a
reference to the system made in Israel. ... [It's a metaphor for the
**need** to have a **degree of protection against a full suite of
threats."**]{.underline}

"[It's an umbrella concept]{.underline}," Karako points out. "It's not
one thing. It's going out and asking the services, the Missile Defense
Agency, all kinds of folks and saying, 'What can you do? What are the
concepts that you can come up with to contribute to fixing this broad
problem?' So, I think that's all for the good."

[The United States, Canada and Finland have **agreed** to **coordinate**
their development of **new icebreaking vessels**]{.underline}

At the NATO Washington summit in July, Canada, Finland and the United
States announced a collaboration on development of new icebreaking
ships. The Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, a non-binding agreement
colloquially known as the ICE Pact, will enable the three countries to
strengthen their shipbuilding industries through information sharing,
workforce development and procurement alignment. Arctic concerns are
growing in Washington, which published an updated strategy for the
region earlier this year.

What next

A joint memorandum of understanding that outlines a framework for
implementing the arrangement is expected to be signed before 2025, and
the Biden administration may push for this to happen ahead of next
month's US presidential election. The memorandum will also include a
mechanism for admitting other countries into the ICE Pact; Russian and
Chinese interest in the Arctic may encourage others to join.

Subsidiary Impacts

A bipartisan congressional group has asked the White House to prioritise
service to the Great Lakes region within the ICE Pact framework.

Quebec-based Davie, Canada's largest shipbuilder, has announced plans to
open a shipyard in the United States.

Last month, China sent its three vessels into the Arctic and announced
that it would fast track the construction of a fourth icebreaker.

Analysis

[The **ICE Pact sends** an **immediate signal** to **industry partners**
that **Canada**, the **United States** and **Finland** are committed to
**purchasing more icebreakers**.]{.underline} [Shipbuilders are
responding by **investing** in **supply chains** and **shipyards** in
**anticipation** of **these orders**]{.underline}, positioning
themselves to earn procurement contracts when public funding for new
projects is made available.

The arrangement reflects NATO's awareness of the Arctic's growing
importance, particularly as Russia and China seek to assert their
presence in the region with icebreaker fleets of their own. [In the
medium-to-long term, collaborative workforce **development** and
information sharing will shorten the **timeline** for icebreaker design

[The recent announcement of a collaborative agreement between Finland,
Canada and the United States]{.underline} [to build polar
icebreakers]{.underline} comes as China has declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" and Russia is operating the largest fleet of
icebreakers in the world, including the only ones that are
nuclear-powered.

But the pact [is]{.underline} as much [about **bolstering allied
shipbuilding industries** as it is about addressing global
threats]{.underline}, [and all **three nations** have something to
**gain**, experts said.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or **[ICE
Pact]{.underline}**, announced on the sidelines of NATO's 75th
anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., July 11, is a trilateral
agreement between the three nations to collaborate on the production of
polar icebreakers alongside allies and partners, labor and industry.

A statement from the White House announcing the agreement said the
collaboration i[s intended to "strengthen the **shipbuilding industry**
and **industrial capacity** of each nation"]{.underline} and "build
closer security and economic ties among our countries through
information exchange and mutual workforce development focused on
building polar icebreakers, as well as other Arctic and polar
capabilities."

The details of the agreement remain hazy, with a memorandum of
understanding promised "by the end of the year," but the statement said
the three governments intend to utilize shipyards in the United States,
Canada and Finland to "build polar icebreakers for their own use, as
well as to work closely with like-minded allies and partners to build
and export polar icebreakers for their needs at speed and affordable
cost."

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters the day of
the announcement that the pact is about "enhancing the collective
capacity of our three countries to build icebreakers at a time when we
are seeing an increasing need for those icebreakers from partners around
the world who want to operate in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions."

[This "increasing need" puts **added pressure** on a **U.S. shipbuilding
industry** that is already a **weak link** in the **country's**
**defense industrial base**]{.underline}, [suffering from **delayed
programs**, maintenance **backlogs** and **workforce** and supply chain
**shortages**, according to government watchdogs.]{.underline}

The U.S. Coast Guard has only two operational polar icebreakers: the
heavy Polar Star and the medium Healy. Polar Star was commissioned in
1976 and Healy in 2000. Both the fleet's size and age create maintenance
vulnerabilities that could cut the fleet in half if one is out of
commission.

The service has been working to expand its fleet through the Polar
Security Cutter program, which has been "plagued by delays" and more
than doubled in cost, according to a report by the Congressional Budget
Office released in August.

An October Congressional Research Service report noted that the Coast
Guard needs eight or nine polar icebreakers, and the first of the new
ships is not likely to enter service until 2029. That raises questions
about what the United States will be able to deliver under the pact when
it is struggling to meet its own demand.

A letter to the White House signed Oct. 2 by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security,
Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said a
reliable icebreaker fleet is "critical" to achieving strategic
objectives in the Arctic.

[The letter also said that strengthening the shipbuilding industry of
each ICE Pact country and generating "**good jobs at shipyards** and
related businesses all over" is the **aim** of the
**partnership**]{.underline} --- especially for advancing polar
icebreaker recapitalization in the United States that is "far too slow."

[**Finland** and **Canada** can help, bringing to the **agreement** a
**history** of icebreaker design and **shipbuilding
experience**]{.underline}. Canada has the second largest icebreaker
fleet in the world behind Russia. Meanwhile, 60 percent of the world's
icebreakers are produced at Finnish shipyards and 80 percent are
designed by Finnish companies, according to the Finnish government.

A Canadian government release said the country's "world-class expertise
in Arctic and polar capabilities" will be "foundational" to the
agreement's success.

#### That's sufficient. ICE is [designed]{.underline} to generate shipbuilding expertise.

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} [appears]{.underline} [set to
broaden his attack on global economic]{.underline} integration [by
imposing new multimillion-dollar fees on the **Chinese container
ships**]{.underline} that bring many foreign goods to U.S. shores.

The proposed fees are intended to counter what the administration
describes --- echoing its predecessor --- as unfair Chinese trade
practices that have given Beijing a chokehold on the construction of
commercial vessels.

Part of a broader White House strategy to revive U.S. shipbuilding, the
levies threaten the system of oceangoing trade that has developed over
the past quarter-century --- and could result in a repeat of the supply
chain disruptions the nation suffered during the pandemic.

By charging Chinese-owned or -built vessels each time they dock at a
U.S. port, the administration hopes to discourage ocean carriers from
buying more ships from China. [The U.S. government would spend some of
the tens of billions of dollars raised through the fees on subsidizing a
commercial **shipbuilding industry** that has fallen into
disrepair.]{.underline}

[Generous **government support**, including tax incentives, would enable
revitalized U.S. shipyards to fill orders that now go to facilities in

for shipping their goods on U.S.-flagged vessels, rising from almost

require **decades** of **consistent** **federal support**]{.underline}.
[Imposing **hefty fees** on **Chinese** ships now, before American-made
alternatives exist, would only raise **freight costs** and **snarl
global supply chains**]{.underline}, they said.

"It appears to be written by people who have absolutely no idea how the
maritime supply chain works," said Lars Jensen, chief executive of
Vespucci Maritime, a consultancy in Copenhagen. "The container lines
will adjust and cut out the smaller ports. The consequence is going to
be massive port congestion in the larger ports."

[The **shipbuilding initiative**]{.underline}, which includes the
creation of a new White House office, represents another element in
Trump's frontal assault on trade orthodoxy. Coupled with his plans for
the most extensive tariffs in nearly a century, it [would reorient
global commerce in an "America First" direction.]{.underline}

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has proposed a complex menu of
fees targeting Chinese ships, scheduled to be the subject of a public
hearing by his agency on Monday.

One levy applies to each port call by a Chinese ocean carrier; a second
would be assessed based on the percentage of Chinese-built ships in a
carrier's fleet; a third depends upon the percentage of the carrier's
future orders that have been placed with Chinese shipyards.

The measures are needed "to create leverage to obtain the elimination"
of Chinese maritime industry dominance, USTR says, suggesting the
president may be prepared to negotiate with Beijing.

If the new port fees are imposed, the three major ocean carrier
alliances, which collaborate like airline industry partnerships, would
probably try to avoid the extra costs by reassigning Chinese-made
container ships from U.S. routes to serve Europe, analysts said.

Some vessels that would be subject to the fees could dock at Canadian or
Mexican ports rather than unload at American wharves --- costing
American dockworkers and truck drivers.

[Smaller carriers]{.underline} [with long-term leases to operate
Chinese-made ships could face ruin,]{.underline} said Hans Laue,
president of Gisholt Shipping in Weston, Florida. Among those affected
would be regional U.S. carriers that ply the waters between South
Florida and gulf ports or Caribbean ports such as Jamaica, the Cayman
Islands and the Dominican Republic.

"[They have hundreds, if not **thousands**, of people working in the
U.S., and they would be **immediately wiped out**]{.underline}," he
said.

Some vessel operators already are trying to cancel contracts with some
U.S. ports and delaying negotiations on new agreements "due to the
uncertainty of costs associated with trading with the United States,"
Brett Bourgeois, executive director of the New Orleans Board of Trade,
said in written comments on the USTR proposal.

Such upheaval in shipping schedules would have consequences for large
and small ports. Container ships normally operate like waterborne buses,
making scheduled stops at multiple ports along a coastline.

But facing fees that might reach \$3.5 million for each stop, they would
probably choose to unload all of their cargo in just one place, such as
the Port of Los Angeles, executives said.

"[You are absolutely going to disrupt the U.S. economy. You'll create
covid-like congestion at places like L.A., Long Beach and New
York]{.underline}," said Joe Kramek, president of the World Shipping
Council, which represents the major ocean carriers.

Fewer vessels docking at smaller ports such as Oakland, California,
would make it harder and more expensive for major U.S. exporters to ship
their goods to foreign customers, and it would affect imports as well.
Farmers who rely on bulk carriers to move grain and other commodities
would be hit especially hard, forced to send their crops hundreds of
miles overland to Southern California.

The proposed fees "will have catastrophic effects on U.S. exports,"
Kevin LaGraize Jr., president of Southport Agencies in Metairie,
Louisiana, said in written comments submitted to USTR.

The fees are just one element in an eight-page draft executive order,
titled "Make Shipbuilding Great Again" and obtained by The Washington
Post, that the administration is finalizing.

U.S. shipyards in recent years typically delivered only a handful of
commercial vessels each year, while China built hundreds. The draft
executive order cites an "urgent need to reinvigorate the U.S.
shipbuilding and maritime industries" and proposes a comprehensive menu
of government aid, including the shipping fees and tariffs on Chinese
cargo-handling gear.

According to a Feb. 27 draft, the president would ask Congress to
establish a dedicated funding source for new shipbuilding ventures.

"We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much,
but we're going to make them very fast, very soon," Trump said in his
address on March 4 to a joint session of Congress.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the
executive order.

[The focus on shipbuilding has bipartisan support]{.underline} --- a
group of labor unions filed a petition seeking government help for
domestic shipmakers during the Biden administration.

In January, just days before President Joe Biden left office, his
administration's USTR endorsed the unions' complaint, concluding in a
182-page investigative report that the Chinese government had used
generous state financing, forced technology transfer, intellectual
property theft and discrimination against foreign firms to increase its
dominance of global maritime markets.

[China's share of global shipbuilding orders rose from less than 5
percent in 1999 to]{.underline} [more than 50 percent by
2023]{.underline}, [depriving U.S. shipyards of business and creating
dangerous "**vulnerabilities** across the U.S.
**economy**]{.underline}," the report said.

[China's **shipbuilding supremacy** also has **military
implications**]{.underline}. Even as relations with Beijing
deteriorated, the U.S. Navy continued to purchase tankers and dry cargo
carriers from Chinese shipyards, according to a 2023 Congressional
Research Service report.

In a speech Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance cited the nation's
shipbuilding decline as an example of deindustrialization that "poses
risks both to our national security and our workforce." Vance contrasted
the industry's performance during World War II, when shipyards turned
out "three ships every two days," with its current annual output of just
five ships.

"Revitalizing domestic shipbuilding is not only possible but also a
priority," said Michael Wessel, a Washington consultant with ties to the
United Steelworkers union. "The principal contributing factor to reduced
capacity has been China's nonmarket pricing of ships. Order books have
dried up. We have existing yards that can do more today, and we have
facilities that can be brought online."

[An **industry revival**]{.underline}, however, [faces **numerous
hurdles**]{.underline}. U[.S. shipyards today have little **presence**
in the **commercial market**]{.underline}, [concentrating instead on
producing **vessels** for the **Navy**]{.underline}. The only
significant recent contract won by a U.S. shipyard came in 2022, when
Matson, a Hawaii-based carrier, ordered three midsize container ships
from the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia.

[Matson]{.underline}, which serves domestic routes, [needs the vessels
to comply with the Jones Act, which requires that cargo moving between
**two American ports** is carried aboard a **U.S.-built
ship.**]{.underline}

[The protectionist law]{.underline}, dating to 1920, [helps explain why
**U.S. shipyards** are so **uncompetitive**]{.underline}, analysts said.
Matson paid roughly \$330 million per ship, while Chinese shipyards
offer similar vessels for just \$60 million, according to Lloyd's List,
a London-based industry publication.

[**Trump's** widespread **imposition** of **import taxes**]{.underline},
including on materials used in shipbuilding such as steel,
[will]{.underline} only [make the domestic industry less competitive in
**global markets**,]{.underline} said Rob Willmington, a Lloyd's List
analyst.

"China builds what the industry wants," he said. "You can go to them
with your own design, and they'll do it and do it for 20 percent less
than South Korea. [What's missing is the **market** for **U.S.

#### Icebreakers [alone]{.underline} can't rebuild the US shipbuilding industry.

Kantchev, foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal based in

Build Them.\" Wall Street Journal. 2-5-2025.

At 13,000 tons, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star is a mammoth vessel
made to cut through Arctic ice more than 20 feet thick. But it is the
U.S.'s only icebreaker that operates year-round, and it was built nearly
half a century ago.

In the intensifying global race to access the Arctic, icebreakers are
the essential tool to open trade routes, allow resource extraction and
project military power. The U.S. and its allies have fallen far behind
Russia, and China is rapidly gaining ground with the help of the world's
largest shipbuilding industry.

President **[Trump]{.underline}** [has signaled that he wants to put the
Arctic back at the top of the]{.underline} [U.S.'s **priority
list**]{.underline}. He has said the U.S. needs to take ownership of
Greenland for national security and that the Coast Guard will expand its
fleet of icebreakers.

"We're going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers. Big ones,"
Trump said last month.

[That will be a **tall order** to **fill**. The U.S. has been struggling
for years to build a **single icebreaker**---vessels that **clear a
path** through the **ice for other ships**]{.underline}. [Even if
**Trump** is able to **marshal** the **political will** and **money** to
**build more,**]{.underline} [the U.S. **will have** to **breathe life
back** into its **ailing shipbuilding industry**, which has been in
decline for decades.]{.underline}

[Russia]{.underline}, [meanwhile, has around **40
icebreakers**]{.underline}, as well as new giant nuclear-powered ones
under construction. Despite being 900 miles from the Arctic Circle,
China has four such vessels. Its first domestically built
nuclear-powered icebreaker could be unveiled as soon as this year,
experts say.

Russia has faced setbacks in recent years. Sanctions over the Ukraine
war have limited its access to components and technologies needed to
build icebreakers, such as propulsion systems and radar equipment. A
nuclear-powered icebreaker under construction called Rossiya is running
three years behind schedule. But it already has a massive lead and years
of experience operating in the Arctic.

As in other areas, Russia is tapping China's investment and
technological support, potentially fueling Beijing's increased interest
in the polar regions. [It took a Chinese shipyard two years to deliver
one **recent icebreaker**. Though the U.S.'s new icebreaker will be a
heavier ice-breaking class than the Chinese vessel, construction started
only recently, five years after the contract was awarded to build
it.]{.underline}

Cost overruns for 46 ships that the Navy has under construction grew

delays for certain naval vessels have stretched up to three years.

"[Nothing is more important than **addressing** the **critical labor

anywhere is credibility everywhere" --- darkly [warn that rolling back

[The opposite is true]{.underline}. [A **navy tasked to do all** these

short-term thinking has taken priority over managing long-term risk.
It's time to flip the script. [Readiness for **great-power
conflict**]{.underline} [--- peace through strength rather than global
policing --- should once again be America's **primary grand-strategic
aim**.]{.underline}

Too Busy, and Too Small

Few Americans appreciate just how busy their navy is. [At any time, over
one-third of U.S. Navy ships are deployed --- the greatest proportion in
history]{.underline}. Sometimes these ships are training with allies and
partners, buttressing American power. Sometimes they are responding to
crises where legitimate American interests are at stake and force may be
necessary. But many of the Navy's overseas duties are unrelated to
coercion or deterrence, including humanitarian operations, freedom of
navigation transits, "maritime security" patrols in far-flung regions,
or various missions under the nebulous banner of norms enforcement.

As my research has shown, [these **operations** come at a **cost**: They
have **shrunk** and **weakened** the U.S. Navy's **surface fleet** to a
shadow of its former self]{.underline}. The reasons lie in politics,
poor strategic foresight, and bureaucracy. While critics usually
describe the problem as a mismatch between operational "demand" and the
"supply" of ships, this mismatch is itself a symptom of an underlying
national confusion about the purpose of the Navy itself. The hard truth
is that stale ideas about America's proper role in the world have
outlived the geopolitical circumstances in which they germinated.

After the Soviet Union dissolved, U.S. policymakers saw a new world
marked by brush-fire conflicts, civil wars, and economic dislocation due
to globalization. Global policing, albeit under more the palatable terms
like "engagement" or "liberal internationalism," became the dominant
foreign policy consensus. To offer flexibility for these brush fires,
the Navy designed its fleet around carrier strike groups and amphibious
readiness groups. The Navy made this case --- that an uncertain world
required presence, and presence required carriers, amphibious ships, and
supporting multi-mission combatants --- in its own planning documents,
and led a public relations campaign to this effect. The 1993 Bottom-Up
Review (the Department of Defense's seminal assessment of required force
structure for the post-Cold War era), under a section entitled "naval
presence," explicitly stated that naval forward presence would require
more large-deck ships than the Navy would need if it used the same
force-planning metric as the other services (the two "major regional
contingency" standard). In other words, "presence" as an idea was good
for the Navy's bottom line --- at first.

Circumstances soon changed. First, the large, exquisite ships that
carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups required were
expensive. Over time, this drove up customer costs and lifecycle costs,
and inhibited alternative force structures and platform choices, because
the coalition of contractors and policymakers benefiting from the
presence-oriented force structure objected to changes. Accordingly, with
time, the Navy purchased fewer vessels overall, and the fleet began to
shrink.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military's geographic combatant commanders ---
empowered a few years earlier under the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act ---
began demanding surface ships for nearly every crisis that arose in
their theaters. Policymakers, too, grew accustomed to "showing the
flag." Sending a carrier strike group to a hot zone was appealing, as it
avoided the political risk and financial cost of overseas basing and was
an easy way to ratchet diplomatic pressure up and down.

In essence, the Navy did its job too well: It designed a fleet and
promoted a concept for operating it that policymakers and combatant
commanders found addictive. So, throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s,
the surface fleet got busier and busier while becoming smaller and
smaller.

Like a car, a ship can only be run so hard until it becomes too
expensive to maintain. As the Navy overused its ships, they retired
early. Other ships picked up their slack and were then overused
themselves. To support the rising tempo of operations, the Navy
repeatedly delayed maintenance on ships. America's shipyards, which
required predictable contracts to remain economically viable, bled
skilled laborers, driving up costs in an endless cycle.

The result was that the surface fleet shrank from over 400 ships in 1994
to an all-time-low of 272 vessels during the Obama administration
(today, it sits at around 300). Even with an ongoing multi-decade,
multi-billion-dollar investment in the nation's public shipyards, the
U.S. Navy will not clear its maintenance backlogs until at least 2040.
Even the chief of naval operations recently acknowledged that the fleet
will not grow any time soon. [Wargames indicate that,]{.underline} [were
the United States to fight China, the U.S. Navy might eke out a
**nominal win**, but one that **blurs** the **line** between victory and
defeat, setting back **American military power** for a
**generation**.]{.underline}

The Readiness Trade-Off

How was all this allowed to happen?

Everyone, from the combatant commanders to the Navy, lost sight of the
trade-off between operational and structural readiness. "Operational"
readiness refers to the ability of existing military units to fight
tonight. "Structural" readiness refers to a military's ability to
generate sufficient mass for multiple rounds in a prolonged fight,
including factors like the health of the defense-industrial base. In
basic terms, an extremely high level of operational readiness is
required for global policing duties; whereas if the goal is fighting a
long war against a peer competitor, structural readiness is more
important. If resources are finite (which they always are), the two
trade off.

In brief, for three decades, [the U.S. Navy traded its structural
readiness]{.underline} (for great-power conflict) [for **operational
readiness**]{.underline} (to support naval forward presence). It [burned
through its **ships**, and **debilitated its shipyards**]{.underline},
to [make sure it could respond to whatever policymakers wanted, whenever
they wanted it, no matter how irrelevant it was to **deterrence** and
**warfighting**.]{.underline}

This was not a problem in the 1990s, when the same fleet busy with
presence operations could still fight off any foreseeable challenger.
But by 2015, given the rise of China, the Navy, oversight agencies,
contracted research organizations, and think tanks were all sounding
alarms. Navy leaders begged Congress, time and again, to reduce the
frequency with which Navy ships were deployed, so that the force could
recoup its readiness.

Then came the collisions. In 2017, two U.S. Navy destroyers, in separate
incidents, crashed into commercial ships, and 17 American sailors lost
their lives. Two investigations --- Secretary of the Navy Richard V.
Spencer's Strategic Readiness Review and Chief of Naval Operations John
M. Richardson's Comprehensive Review --- offered recommendations to
restore the Navy's readiness. The Navy's highest-level investigation
even recommended "condition\[ing\] congressional and executive branch
leaders to accept that the higher cost and time to achieve established
readiness standards will mean less Navy presence worldwide." This never
happened, because Congress continued to assume the Navy could balance
both operational and structural readiness, as my research delineating
the hearings after the accidents has shown.

Legislation passed after the collisions resolved none of the Navy's
presence-induced headaches. Congress enacted reforms to restore
operational readiness but ignored the Navy's proposed reforms to improve
its structural readiness. The Strategic Readiness Review had proposed
changes to the Navy's readiness commands (such as eliminating the
so-called "Inouye Amendment") and changes to the adjudication of
combatant commanders' requests for forces. Instead, what the Navy got
was a little more officer training here, some sleep requirements for
officers there. After dipping for one year after the collisions, the
Navy's operational tempo continued its inexorable annual rise that began
in the 1990s. Presence was simply too popular an idea.

**[Shipbuilding is Not Enough]{.underline}**

[The U.S. Navy's **readiness** for **sustained combat**]{.underline}
[--- and hence its **ability** to deter China --- is in a **catastrophic
state**]{.underline}. The Trump administration should give the U.S. Navy
a fighting chance to rebuild itself.

It can start with the unfinished business of 2017, reforming the global
force management process (the process by which the Department of Defense
adjudicates combatant commanders' requests for military forces) to
prioritize structural readiness over emergent demands. In this process,
the service chiefs and the joint staff consider combatant commander
needs in their theaters and recommend service assets that can be made
available to them. Should a combatant commander need forces in excess of
this established allocation (an "emergent requirement"), he or she can
submit a "request for forces." The idea that the services should "just
say no" to such requests is aspirational, but difficult. Why? Because
--- as the Strategic Readiness Review noted --- the Navy has developed a
culture of meeting non-stop (presence-driven) operational demands.

As the review also points out, [the multiple overlapping authorities and
the adverse growth of staffs within the Navy has made tracking the
long-term effects of operations]{.underline} [on **structural
readiness** a **nightmare**]{.underline}. In addition, the staff of the
chief of naval operations, located in the Pentagon, appears biased
towards operational demands and can lose sight of long-term readiness.
The problem is not that the Navy lacks input in global force management,
but that the Navy still does not "say no" enough. To resolve this, the
review recommended establishing the initial force availability as the
"maximum supportable peacetime force," such that any further combatant
commander requests for forces can only be met with forces moved from
other theaters. This is, in essence, a hard cap on what the Navy can do,
ensuring that unready units are never sent to meet the latest and
greatest combatant commander request.

[But emergent demands aside]{.underline}, [Navy operational tempo will
still **remain too high** to restore **structural**
**readiness**.]{.underline} The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
[should]{.underline} therefore [reevaluate]{.underline} [the idea of
**naval forward presence** itself]{.underline}: the notion that
America's Navy is foremost a provider of global goods, and a global
policeman, rather than the preeminent warfighting force of a maritime
power whose primary goals ought to be deterring --- and if necessary,
winning --- [a great-power conflict.]{.underline}

[FROM BEFORE THE COMMON ERA until Pearl Harbor, great powers competed at
sea as much as on land.]{.underline} Carthage, Rome, and Troy fought
regularly on the waters of the Mediterranean. Enormous fleets---the 1588
Spanish Armada boasted 130 ships---plied the oceans, fighting other
fleets, seizing prizes, and staking claims to territory. Even in the
days of sail, warships crossed the world: early in the sixteenth
century, the Chinese and Portuguese navies clashed repeatedly near
what\'s now Hong Kong. For millennia, nations sunk into their navies
amounts that might have ended want, only to behold the investments
literally sink. During the modern era, Argentina, Brazil, Britain,
Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States have
expended groaning chests of treasure on warships. Naval rivalries
between Britain and Germany helped ignite both world wars. The Pacific
Theater fighting of World War Il began in part because of America\'s
1940 decision to forward-deploy its fleet from California to Hawaii,
closer to Tokyo, and in part because Japan placed an existential wager
on the maritime theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the society
of famous persons who proved, following their deaths, to have been wrong
about practically everything. [Many centuries of an extravagant naval
arms race culminated]{.underline} in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte
Gulf, where 367 warships and 1,800 aircraft hammered at each other with
cannon, bombs, torpedoes, and battleship shells weighing up to 3,000
pounds apiece. [Then the **naval arms race stopped**. **So did naval
fighting**. The **seas have been quiet** for nearly **seventy- five
years**]{.underline}, perhaps the longest stretch without bloodshed on
the waters since first the sail was hoisted. [Some Argentine and British
ships clashed during the 1982 Falklands conflict]{.underline}, and
Iranian and Iraqi vessels scuffled around oil tankers during the mid-
1980s, [but **big fights at sea have come to a halt**, as has the
**great-power naval competition**.]{.underline} The [last time a major
naval battle occurred, India was not yet an independent
nation]{.underline}, the solid-state transistor had not been invented,
and the Dodgers played in Brooklyn. [Century upon century of great-power
competition at sea ended with a **final score of 10---0**.]{.underline}
That\'s the [number of supercarrier strike groups possessed by the
**U**nited **S**tates (ten) versus the number possessed by **all other**
nation**s** combined (zero).]{.underline} World War Il left the warships

march in Fourth of July parades, and Air Force fighters can perform
Super Bowl flyovers; the Navy\'s boats can be observed only on the

either. There\'s no compelling reason to think about a well-behaved
military force stationed on the opposite side of the globe. Under US
Navy hegemony, [piracy still occurs, but great powers have not seized
merchant ships in three generations.]{.underline} That cargo ships whose
decks are stacked with containers of valuable goods can steam anywhere
without fear of being impounded by a warship is the unseen reason global
trade took off, and global trade benefits almost everyone, while
reducing war. The reality that the [US Navy rules the blue water both
**reduces a historic cause of conflict** and **enables the prosperity of
the contemporary era**.]{.underline} Speaking at West Point as
president, Obama said that the United States does not use its might to
acquire territory or seize resources. Instead, [American might is
employed to pursue what US leaders believe is best for the
world.]{.underline} Such beliefs may be wrong, even tragically so. But
has any other nation that possessed overwhelming military force ever
refrained from using force for conquest or pursuit of riches? That is
the unseen question of the oceans---unseen because fighting on the water
has stopped.

The Consequences of an Icebreaker Gap

Thankfully for Washington, [the consequences of this **icebreaker gap**
for U.S. defense are often **misunderstood** or
**overstated**]{.underline}. First, many of the specific military
challenges that China or Russia might pose in the Arctic are independent
of icebreakers and best dealt with in other ways. These include denying
the United States access to the region, missile strikes against the
homeland, the ability to move forces from the homeland, and
demonstrating U.S. strength against challenges.

[It is not clear how Russia or China would **leverage icebreakers** to
exclude the United **States from the region**]{.underline}, [or how the
United States would utilize icebreakers to **overcome** such
**attempts**]{.underline}. [Take the concern of Russia denying access
along the]{.underline} **[Northern Sea Route]{.underline}** (setting
aside the limited trans-Arctic shipping to date and modest future
projections[). The Russian ability to do this stems primarily from their
growing missile, air, and surveillance **capabilities** deployed
**within their own territory**]{.underline}. As Mathieu Boulègue
observes, the Russian Northern Fleet will likely be able to perform some
sea denial missions "at a limited operational tempo." Yet "the majority
of its assets are not Arctic-specific, operating beyond the region and
in other strategic directions." [Increasing the numbers of **U.S.
icebreakers** would not **overcome** the **Russian** **shore-based
area-denial challenge**]{.underline}. In the event of a crisis, naval
surface vessels operating behind slow-moving icebreakers would be,
Andreas Kuersten notes, "sitting ducks for aerial, undersea, and
shore-based enemy forces."

Like a cursed spell, space-based missile defense keeps getting
resurrected --- no matter how many times it's been banished.

President Trump's Executive Order, [The Iron Dome for
America]{.underline}, released Jan. 27, 2025, [orders]{.underline} the
Department of Defense to develop and deploy [a "next-generation missile
defense shield" --- a system that would include **space-based
interceptors** (**SBI**)]{.underline} [to defend against **ballistic
missiles** in their **boost phase**]{.underline}. Space-based missile
defense was a key part of President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative and has resurfaced intermittently ever since.

Once again, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is dreaming
that it can shield itself from nuclear-armed missiles with an
**impenetrable defense**]{.underline}. [But it didn't work then, and it
won't work]{.underline} [now---and pretending otherwise will only
**fuel** an **arms race**, **weaken strategic stability**, and divert
resources from **more effective defenses**]{.underline}. Instead, [the
U.S. is likely to end up with **little real protection**]{.underline}
[--- while facing a **wave** of **new** **threats.**]{.underline} Unless
this idea is dispelled once and for all, [we will be doomed to repeat
this **dangerous cycle**]{.underline}---at great cost and even greater
risk.

Boost-phase missile defense targets a ballistic missile just after
launch, when it's still moving relatively slowly, is easily tracked by
radar and hasn't yet deployed decoys or countermeasures that complicate
interception. But the window of opportunity is vanishingly short: for
solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), there are mere
minutes to detect the launch, track the target, fire an interceptor and
score a hit. This necessitates the interceptors to be positioned nearby,
which makes low Earth orbit (LEO) appealing.

[On paper, it sounds promising. **In practice**, it **simply doesn't
work**.]{.underline}

As Laura Grego, research director and senior scientist for the Global
Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, has argued, [the
premise of a reliable shield against **ICBMs** is a
**fantasy**]{.underline}. Sixty years and \$350 billion have produced a
system that at best is capable of intercepting a highly contrived test
target 57% of the time, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Advocacy
Alliance. But [the problems of]{.underline} [**SBI** extend beyond
**technical challenges**: they're **baked** into the **laws** of
**physics**.]{.underline}

Ballistic missile interceptors stationed in space constantly circle the
planet. That means thousands of satellites would be required to ensure
that at least one is in position to intercept a missile during its brief
boost phase.

[A 2004 American Physical Society study found that, even under ideal
conditions, **1,600 interceptors** would be needed just to **target a
single** ICBM from North Korea, Iran or Iraq]{.underline}. For context,
[China has an estimated **400 ICBMs**]{.underline}, while Russia has
about 326. And together, they span a landmass more than 12 times larger
than North Korea, Iran and Iraq combined. The sheer scale of the
challenge makes this system impractical at best and absurd at worst.

While proponents of the system cite declining launch costs as evidence
of its feasibility, that's only part of the story: the real cost lies in
operating, maintaining and repairing a system that is inherently
brittle. Not only must it function in a remote and harsh environment,
but it is also vulnerable to being blinded, disabled, overwhelmed,
hacked or circumvented far more easily than its advocates suggest,
offering little protection under real-world conditions.

Conjuring an arms race

Far from enhancing security, [**SBIs** are **likely** to **increase
global instability**]{.underline}. President [Trump]{.underline} [claims
they will provide "peace through strength]{.underline}," echoing
Reagan's rhetoric. But history shows that [chasing invulnerability only
**fuels arms races**]{.underline}. [Rival states won't just **counter**
these **defenses**]{.underline} [--- they will **surpass** them,
investing in cheaper, more **adaptable offensive
technologies**.]{.underline} Worse, [they may feel pressured to **strike
preemptively** before their **nuclear deterrent** is **neutralized**.
Instead of reducing **threats**, **space-based missile defense** creates
**new ones.**]{.underline}

The risks extend beyond security. [Kinetic **interceptions** could
generate **hazardous** **space debris**, threatening **both military**
and **civilian operations**]{.underline}, [not to mention **risks** to
**satellites** in the **line of fire**.]{.underline}

Worse still, the U.S. would be giving up effective diplomatic tools for
a sham capability. This year, the United Nations is launching a
four-year initiative to prevent an arms race in outer space. For
decades, SBIs have been a point of contention in arms control debates,
with China and Russia advocating for a treaty banning space weapons,
while others saw them as a distraction from more immediate threats like
anti-satellite (ASAT) missile tests. [If the specter of SBI moves closer
to reality, there will be renewed **international efforts** to outlaw
**them**]{.underline}. This effort could undermine U.S. leadership in
space security, derail diplomatic initiatives to curb destructive ASAT
missile tests and ultimately weaken efforts to promote responsible space
behavior. The result would be a less secure and more dangerous space
environment.

Beneath the technical, financial and geopolitical flaws of space-based
missile defense lies a deeper issue: [the myth of
invulnerability]{.underline}. [The idea that we can shield ourselves
from catastrophic threats is not just unrealistic --- it is
**dangerous**]{.underline}. [Real security doesn't come from illusions
of invulnerability, but from arms control, diplomacy and shared risk
reduction.]{.underline}

exercise]{.underline}. Even a very small percentage of defense "leakage"
by a first striker who is also supported by next-generation missile
defenses could inflict historically unprecedented and socially
unacceptable damage on the attacker's own society.

Moreover, even the most demanding tests and exercises under artificial
conditions cannot capture the total effects of nuclear war on the armed

The Perils of Unconstrained Missile Defense

The United States has spent more than \$165 billion to experiment and
produce the technological breakthroughs necessary to field an effective,
limited homeland and regional missile defense system.15 Over the last
two decades, the unconstrained experimentation has resulted in a
globally distributed, technologically advanced architecture of missile
defense interceptors, platforms, and sensors. [Although these efforts
have not shifted the advantage to the defense, they potentially can
produce **damaging consequences** for **strategic stability** between
**major nuclear powers**.]{.underline}

The architecture, in principle, portends the ability to realize a
surprise breakthrough in strategic defensive capability against Russia
and China. For instance, reacting to advances in North Korean ballistic
missiles, the fiscal year 2018 NDAA mandated the U.S. Missile Defense
Agency (MDA) to test the technological feasibility of the Standard
Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA interceptor to defeat an ICBM threat.16 These
interceptors initially were designed to defend against medium- and
intermediate-range ballistic missiles. On November 16, 2020, the agency
employed a ballistic missile defense-capable ship to launch an SM-3 IIA
and intercept an ICBM-range missile.17 The use of these interceptors for
homeland defense against North Korean ICBMs may now be de facto policy.
In June 2021, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks reportedly
authorized the transfer of 11 SM-3 IIA interceptors from research to
deployment after the successful flight test.18

The technological evolution in the performance of interceptors is
further reinforced by a separate dedicated effort to advance the
state-of-the-art sensor technologies supporting missile defense
missions. The SPY-6(V)1 radar, performing a variety of missions
including missile defense, originally had a programmatic requirement for
a sensor to be 30 times more sensitive than the current SPY-1 radar
deployed on ballistic missile defense-capable ships.19 Yet, the
SPY-6(V)1 radar has turned out better than expected and is "nearly 100
times more sensitive" than the SPY-1 radar.20 Alternatively measured,
the SPY-6(V)1 could track objects with similar signatures at
approximately three times the range of SPY-1 radar. U.S. advances in
missile defense radars have progressed alongside technological gains in
space-based tracking and cueing.

[Each of these **technological capabilities**,]{.underline} [in its
individual capacity, originated as a]{.underline} [way to defend
**against** **regional threats**]{.underline}, but the summation of
these accumulated technological capabilities has a much larger strategic
impact than their individual parts. A three-fold increase in the
tracking range of the organic radar sensors of ballistic missile
defense-capable ships armed with interceptors capable of homeland
missile defense missions significantly expands the capabilities of these
platforms. Additionally, the MDA has proposed a layered homeland defense
architecture consisting of the GMD system augmented by underlayers of
SM-3 IIA and THAAD interceptors.21

Such a layered **[homeland missile defense]{.underline}** architecture
may rapidly expand the number of interceptors and opportunities for
interception from the tens to the hundreds. It could provide, in
principle, a significant capability for strategic defense against
Russian and Chinese missiles. [A homeland defense shield buttressed
by]{.underline} a shoot-look-shoot GMD system that can pursue two
distinct intercept attempts, followed by the SM-3 Block IIA interceptors
as an underlayer and THAAD interceptors for terminal defense, [cannot
**reasonably** be **claimed to be limited**]{.underline}.22 [Such a
**multilayered missile defense** architecture would be viewed as
**highly destabilizing** and **catalyze an arms race**.]{.underline}

Rethinking Missile Defense

[U.S. missile defense efforts have produced a worst**-of-both-worlds
situation**]{.underline}. [On the one hand, against increasingly
**sophisticated** regional **missile threats**]{.underline}, [the
efforts to deploy a robust regional missile defense shield **appear
improbable**]{.underline}. [At the same]{.underline} time, [the growing
pace of North Korean capabilities]{.underline} and systemic U.S.
technical failures [raises **severe doubts** about the viability of the
GMD homeland missile **defense** **system**.]{.underline}23 On the other
hand, [the accumulation of a range of **technological capabilities** to
support the **missile defense mission** undermines **strategic
stability**.]{.underline}

U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, discussing U.S. fears of a
Soviet technological breakthrough in missile defense systems in 1967,
observed that it did not make "much difference what the evidence
indicates...because I believe we must assume for planning" purposes that
a system with the probable characteristic of a missile defense system
can at some future point emerge as a capable defense.24 Throughout the
1960s, U.S. nuclear war planners espoused a greater-than-expected threat
metric to offset any future Soviet technical breakthroughs in missile
defense. Similarly, prudence requires Russian and Chinese analysts to
assume any limited U.S. system is a stalking horse for a more
substantial defense. If worst-case planning is the baseline to determine
requirements for strategic deterrence, Russia and China could easily
postulate imminent U.S. qualitative and quantitative breakthroughs.

ballistic missile launcher crosses Red Square during the Victory Day
military parade in May 2022. (Photo by Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty
Images)After the end of the Cold War, U.S. policymakers were willing to
suspend the logic of strategic stability in the pursuit of missile
defense. Yet, such a posture is no longer possible. The United States
has declared the reemergence of great-power competition. The 2022
Nuclear Posture Review asserts the emergence of two major nuclear
powers, Russia and China, as U.S. strategic competitors and potential
adversaries. The review acknowledges "new stresses" on stability and
deterrence.25 The pursuit of unconstrained missile defense systems is
one of those stressors. [U.S. efforts to **maintain** a **viable
homeland** and regional **missile defense** have reached the point where
the **vector sum**]{.underline} [of the **emerging capabilities** of the
various interceptors]{.underline} and [sensors **already
surpass**]{.underline}, [in theory, the **requirements** of a highly
capable **homeland defense** that could **function** against **major
nuclear powers.**]{.underline}

A rethinking of the logic and purpose of the U.S. missile defense
enterprise is urgently needed. First, the role of defensive and
offensive forces against regional missile threats has to be reexamined
in light of recent experiences, including the Russian war against
Ukraine. [**Missile defense** in a regional context may play niche
roles, but it cannot be the **essence** of the **U.S. deterrent** and
**war-fighting strategy**]{.underline}. [Second, technology creep
continues to erode the separation between regional and **homeland
systems**]{.underline}. U.S. policymakers must institute clear limits to
highlight the separation between these systems. Finally, policymakers
also must explore arms control measures to constrain regional ballistic
missile arsenals.

Although arms control diplomacy appears infeasible in the prevailing
geopolitical environment, a treaty akin to the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty constraining ballistic missile proliferation and
missile defense systems simultaneously would address the concerns of the
United States, Russia, and China. Such arms control efforts may become
viable in the future, and Washington must be prepared to seize any
opening.

As shown repeatedly over the past 60 years, the only way to eliminate
the threat of nuclear-armed missiles is to negotiate their elimination.
Pretending that there is a magic shield that can be willed into
existence will only make the problem of national missile defense worse.

**[However]{.underline}**, [it is not melting permafrost directly that
**poses** the **most immediate risk**,]{.underline} added Claverie.
"[The danger comes from another global warming impact: the
**disappearance** of **Arctic sea ice**]{.underline}. [That is allowing
increases in **shipping**, **traffic** and **industrial development** in
Siberia]{.underline}. [Huge **mining operations** are being planned, and
are going to **drive** vast **holes** into the **deep permafrost** to
**extract oil and ores**.]{.underline}

"[Those operations will **release vast amounts** of **pathogens** that
still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The
effects could be **calamitous**."]{.underline}

This point was stressed by Koopmans. "[If you look at the history of
epidemic outbreaks, one of the **key drivers** has been **change in land
use**]{.underline}. Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were driven
from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been linked to
the spread of urbanisation in Africa. [And that is what we are about to
**witness** in the **Arctic**: a **complete change in land use**, and
that could be dangerous, as we have seen **elsewhere**."]{.underline}

Scientists believe that **[permafrost]{.underline}** -- at its deepest
levels -- [may contain viruses that are up to a **million years
old**]{.underline} and so will be far older than our own species, which
is thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago.

"[Our immune systems may have never **been** in **contact** with **some
of those microbes**, and that is another worry]{.underline}," said
Claverie. "The scenario of an unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal
coming back at us, although unlikely, has become a real possibility."

CONCLUSIONS

[Currently available data indicate that there is **no increased risk**
of **human viral pathogen**]{.underline} [emergence from **permafrost**
**compared** to **other environmental sources**]{.underline}. We do not
claim that viral pathogens in permafrost pose zero risk or that
surveillance of putative viral pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary.
[However, there is currently **no evidence** that **human** or animal
viral **pathogens** **frozen in permafrost pose** an **imminent disease
outbreak threat**]{.underline}. Though climate change is accelerating
thaw, [the **entry** of microbes from **ancient permafrost** into the
modern environment is not a **new phenomenon**]{.underline}. [Permafrost
is continually and naturally exposed to the modern environment by
**processes** such as **erosion**]{.underline},
[cryoturbation]{.underline}, [frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and
**climate fluctuations**]{.underline} (151--153). [Humans have been in
the Arctic for more than 40,000 years]{.underline} (Alaska up to 25,000
years and Scandinavia \~5,000 to 12,000 years) (154--156). This suggests
that [people are]{.underline} and have been [**regularly exposed** to
**viruses** from **permafrost soils**]{.underline}, with no clear
evidence for large-scale health consequences.

[Framing viral discovery efforts]{.underline} in the cryosphere [as a
search for "zombie viruses]{.underline}" or potentially [pandemic
pathogens]{.underline} [is]{.underline} not particularly useful and
**[perhaps even harmful.]{.underline}** Stoking fears of viruses in
thawing permafrost may inadvertently discourage customary and
traditional cultural practices among subarctic and Arctic residents or
divert attention from the more pressing ways that pathogens in the
warming Arctic pose risk to human health and well-being (157). For
example, wildlife and humans increasingly occupy shared habitats,
providing opportunities for viruses maintained in animals to spillover
into humans (90). Arthropod and rodent disease vector ranges are
expanding and shifting northward (158). Extreme precipitation and
flooding events are increasing, threatening infrastructure such as water
and waste treatment facilities (159--161). Higher temperatures increase
the survival of some water-borne disease agents (91). Furthermore,
wildlife health may be affected as a consequence of climate change,
which further compromises fragile ecosystems and the people that rely
upon them (162).

worried should we be?.\" The Conversation. 12-14-2022.

[Scientists have recently revived several large viruses that had been
buried in the frozen Siberian ground (permafrost) for **tens of
thousands of years**.]{.underline}

The youngest virus to be revived was a sprightly 27,000 years old. And
the oldest -- a Pandoravirus -- was around 48,500 years old. This is the
oldest virus ever to have been revived.

As the world continues to warm, the thawing permafrost is releasing
organic matter that has been frozen for millennia, including bacteria
and viruses -- some that can still reproduce.

This latest work was by a group of scientists from France, Germany and
Russia; they managed to reanimate 13 viruses -- with such exotic names
as Pandoravirus and Pacmanvirus -- drawn from seven samples of Siberian
permafrost.

Assuming that the samples were not contaminated during extraction
(always difficult to guarantee) these would indeed represent viable
viruses that had previously only replicated tens of thousands of years
ago.

[This is not the first time that a viable virus has been detected in
permafrost samples.]{.underline} Earlier studies have reported the
detection of a Pithovirus and a Mollivirus.

In their preprint (a study that is yet to be reviewed by other
scientists), the authors state that it is "legitimate to ponder the risk
of ancient viral particles remaining infectious and getting back into
circulation by the thawing of ancient permafrost layers". So what do we
know so far about the risk of these so-called "zombie viruses"?

[All the viruses cultured so far from such samples are giant DNA viruses
that only affect amoebae. They are far from **viruses** that affect
**mammals**, let alone, humans and would be **very unlikely** to **pose
a danger to humans**.]{.underline}

However, one such large amoebae-infecting virus, called Acanthamoeba
polyphaga mimivirus, has been linked to pneumonia in humans. But this
association is still far from proven. So [it **does not appear** that
the **viruses** **cultured** from **permafrost** samples pose a **threat
to public health**.]{.underline}

A more relevant area of concern is that as the permafrost thaws it could
release the bodies of long-dead people who might have died of an
infectious disease and so release that infection back into the world.

[The only human infection that has been eradicated globally is
smallpox]{.underline} and the reintroduction of smallpox, especially in
hard-to-reach locations, could be a global disaster. Evidence of
smallpox infection has been detected in bodies from permafrost burials
but "only partial gene sequences" so broken bits of virus that could not
infect anyone. [The smallpox virus does]{.underline}, [however, survive
well **when frozen at -20°C**, but still only for a **few decades** and
**not centuries**.]{.underline}

In the last couple of decades, scientists have exhumed the bodies of
people who died from the Spanish flu and were buried in
permafrost-affected ground in Alaska and Svalbard, Norway. The influenza
virus was able to be sequenced but not cultured from the tissues of
these deceased people. Influenza **[viruses]{.underline}** [can survive
frozen for at least a year when frozen but **probably not several
decades**.]{.underline}

[From tackling **black carbon emissions** to mapping **whale**
**migration routes** across the **Arctic Ocean**]{.underline},
[advancing marine protections, and supporting Indigenous-led
conservation, these achievements demonstrate the power of collaboration,
science, and **leadership** in **Arctic conservation**.]{.underline}

Driving conservation through collaborative partnerships

[Collaborative efforts are driving impactful marine conservation across
the Arctic]{.underline}. In Alaska, WWF-US is partnering with the Inuit
communities of Kotlik and Emmonak to better understand beluga whales in
the Yukon River. Through acoustic monitoring, this initiative combines
Indigenous knowledge and science to study how belugas are adapting to a
changing ecosystem, ensuring their protection.

In Greenland, WWF is supporting sustainable tourism development by
helping tour operators learn from Iceland's experiences. This initiative
focuses on expanding tourism in the region while protecting the pristine
environment that makes East Greenland unique. By promoting best
practices, the project aims to balance economic opportunities with
environmental conservation.

In Nunavut, Canada, WWF-Canada is working closely with Inuit leaders to
support community-led conservation projects. These efforts focus on
conserving natural areas and species while simultaneously protecting
livelihoods and enhancing food security. By aligning conservation with
community priorities, the initiative strengthens both ecological and
human well-being.

These projects showcase the power of partnerships that blend Indigenous
leadership, local knowledge, and scientific expertise.

In 2024, WWF celebrated a significant milestone for Arctic marine
conservation with the publication of a scientific paper detailing
ArcNet, a groundbreaking framework for protecting Arctic ecosystems.
Originally introduced in 2021, ArcNet identifies 83 priority areas for
conservation across the Arctic Ocean laying the foundation for a
comprehensive network of marine protected and conserved areas. This
publication advances global understanding of the Arctic's biodiversity
and provides a clear path for conservation action.

The paper showcases ArcNet's methodology, which identifies critical
habitats, such as breeding grounds and feeding areas for Arctic marine
life. By sharing these findings, WWF has equipped policymakers and
stakeholders with a blueprint and the tools needed to meet global
conservation targets, including protecting 30 per cent of the world's
oceans by 2030.

[Protecting the **Central Arctic Ocean** from
**overfishing**]{.underline}

In 2024, a key step was taken to ensure the future protection of the
Central Arctic Ocean through the continued implementation of the Central
Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement (CAOFA). This landmark agreement
prevents unregulated commercial fishing in this sensitive and rapidly
changing region. During a meeting held in June 2024, WWF emphasized two
critical points:

The need to identify and protect sensitive areas where even exploratory
fishing would be harmful.

The importance of delaying adoption of regulations unless they meet the
highest standards of precaution.

The outcome of this meeting reflects this cautious approach, with
parties agreeing to take additional time to refine the rules. This delay
provides an opportunity to ensure the regulations are truly robust and
to strengthen the agreement by carving out areas where fishing will be
prohibited. WWF remains actively engaged, offering concrete proposals to
make CAOFA a model for precautionary governance in the Arctic Ocean.

**[Safeguarding Arctic whales]{.underline}**

In September of 2024, we produced a significant and essential building
block for whale conservation with the release of WWF's Arctic Blue
Corridors online report. This interactive resource highlights the
critical migratory routes of narwhals, bowhead whales, and
belugas---routes that are vital for their survival. The report also
reveals a concerning overlap between these blue corridors and increasing
ship traffic in the Arctic, which has surged by 37 per cent from 2013 to
2023. This growing presence of vessels brings threats, such as fatal
collisions and underwater noise pollution, disrupting the whales'
ability to navigate, feed, and avoid predators.

The report underscores the urgent need for Arctic countries to
incorporate blue corridors into their biodiversity commitments,
including protecting 30 per cent of oceans by 2030. It also calls on the
shipping industry to adapt by rerouting ships away from critical whale
habitats or slowing down in unavoidable migration bottlenecks. These
measures, combined with innovative solutions like quieter ship
technologies, offer a clear path forward. Now is the time to act.

**[Tackling black carbon in the Arctic]{.underline}**

[The ban on heavy fuel oil]{.underline} ([HFO]{.underline}) in the
Arctic, [which came into effect on 1 July 2024, marks a significant
milestone in **protecting** this **fragile ecosystem**]{.underline}. HFO
is not only a highly polluting fuel but also a major source of black
carbon, a short-lived yet potent climate pollutant produced by the
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. When black carbon settles on
Arctic snow and ice, it accelerates melting by reducing reflectivity,
contributing to the region's warming at alarming rates. However, the ban
includes significant loopholes which delay full implementation until
2029, meaning the risk to Arctic biodiversity remains significant.

In October 2024, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) took an
important step by agreeing to advance discussions on regulating black
carbon emissions. During the Marine Environment Protection Committee
meeting (MEPC 82), the IMO committed to exploring the concept of 'polar
fuels', which could dramatically reduce black carbon emissions by
requiring ships to transition from dirty HFO to cleaner alternatives,
such as distillate fuels or low-carbon options.

This progress follows over a decade of inaction, despite clear evidence
of black carbon's devastating impact on Arctic ice and global climate
systems. Member States now have until January 2025 to refine proposals
for mandatory regulations, which could be adopted by 2026. While this is
a positive development, swift action is essential to secure lasting
protection for the Arctic and mitigate global climate change.

**[Pausing deep-sea mining in Norway]{.underline}**

In 2024, Norway's plans for deep-sea mining faced significant pushback,
resulting in a critical pause to reconsider environmental protections.
Deep-sea mining threatens fragile marine ecosystems, many of which
remain unexplored. Despite global calls for caution, Norway aimed to
authorize mining without sufficient environmental impact assessments,
raising concerns about compliance with national and international laws,
including the newly adopted High Seas Treaty designed to protect marine
biodiversity.

WWF Norway and other civil society groups stepped in, filing a lawsuit
against the Norwegian government for failing to apply the precautionary
principle and thoroughly evaluate the environmental risks. The legal
challenge, combined with public opposition, sparked widespread debate
and scrutiny of the government's approach. The turning point came when
the Socialist Left Party intervened in Parliament, demanding a halt to
the mining plans. This led to a pause in the authorization process,
marking a major victory for ocean conservation.

Looking ahead: A shared responsibility

As the Arctic faces ever-increasing challenges, the need for bold,
unified action has never been greater. [These **conservation successes**
show what is possible when countries, communities, and **organizations
come together**]{.underline}. [By continuing to prioritize
**collaboration**,]{.underline} innovation, and Indigenous leadership,
[we can create a future where the Arctic thrives as a

[Climate change demands that we work at a larger scale than

German scientist Dr Nicole Biebow is keenly aware of how important it is
to research and protect the Earth's increasingly fragile polar regions.

The two poles are warming faster than any other area on the planet and
are losing ice through increased melting. The Arctic, for example, is
warming three times as fast as the global average, according to polar
scientists. This affects local communities and wildlife, but also has
broad socio-economic and climate impacts that extend across the globe,
like rising sea levels.

"We always say that the poles are the canary in the coal mine," said
Biebow, the project coordinator of an EU-funded project named
EU-PolarNet 2, which concluded in December 2024.

Biebow is the head of the international cooperation unit at the Alfred
Wegener Institute in Germany and also a former chair of [the **European
Polar Board** (**EPB**]{.underline}). The EPB [is an independent group
of **research institutes**]{.underline}, [funding agencies and
ministries set up to advance the coordination of **European polar
research** both in the **Arctic** and **Antarctic**.]{.underline}

[The EPB and another key polar research body]{.underline}, [the European
Polar Coordination Office]{.underline} ([EPCO]{.underline}), [will be
operating out of Sweden's **far north from 2025**]{.underline}. [This
reflects Europe's determination to be the **leading voice** in
**studying** these high**-latitude regions.**]{.underline}

EU-PolarNet 2 carried out much of the work to establish the EPCO, which
will start work in January 2025, hosted by the Arctic Centre at Umeå
University, Sweden.

A sense of urgency

As global temperatures increase and the polar ice melts ever faster,
unlocking the secrets of the polar regions is becoming increasingly
urgent.

"A lot of work being done nowadays is about understanding, mitigating or
adapting to future changes," Biebow said, noting that "we have EU Member
States that have an Arctic coastline and people living in these areas".

As the EU-PolarNet 2 team prepares to launch **[EPCO]{.underline}**, the
researchers have [put together a list of priorities for **future
research**, including projects on **sea ice**, melting **glaciers** and
**thawing permafrost**.]{.underline}

Biebow voiced hope that **[EPCO]{.underline}** [will considerably help
**research efforts** in the **polar** **regions**.]{.underline}

"The poles, like the deep ocean, are still very, very sparsely
investigated," she said. "It's an area which defines how our future
weather and climate will be, and that's why it is so important."

China's pursuit of great power status is drawing it to the frozen
reaches of the world's polar regions. In both the Arctic and Antarctic,
**[China]{.underline}** [has undertaken ambitious expeditions and
**developed world-class research facilities**.]{.underline} These
investments have elevated China's voice in polar affairs and afforded it
an opportunity to shape the emerging geopolitical landscape.

Its growing physical footprint in the world's most remote frontiers also
serves to advance China's broader strategic and military interests.

In the Arctic, melting ice sheets present a host of significant
challenges for the global community. While leaders in Beijing are
clear-eyed about the threats posed by climate change, Chinese
strategists also see a potential silver lining.

The changing Arctic environment is expected to open new shipping routes
that could reduce transit times for seaborne trade and make it easier
for China to access the region's natural resources.

Yet without sovereign jurisdiction in the Arctic, China leans on
partnerships with other states to further its interests.

[China has two permanent research stations in the region, one located in
Norway's **Svalbard archipelago** and the **other** in
**Iceland**]{.underline}. [Both sites support a diverse range of
**research**, from **marine ecology** to **atmospheric
physics**.]{.underline}

A third facility being utilized by China in northern Sweden is under
scrutiny due to suspected ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
jeopardizing China\'s access to the site.

Beijing faces mounting roadblocks elsewhere. Several Arctic
countries---including the United States---have voiced concerns about
China's presence in the region.

Left with few other options, China is stepping up its investments in
Russia as it looks to Moscow as its strategic partner of choice in the
Arctic.

This may prove to be China's best path forward as both the climate and
geopolitical competition heat up in the Arctic.

Arctic Aspirations

Despite being situated some 1,400 km (nearly 900 miles) south of the
Arctic circle, China has styled itself a "near-Arctic state" and
declared its ambitions to become a "polar great power" (极地强国) by
2030.

A 2018 Arctic policy white paper asserts that developments in the region
have "a vital bearing" on China and lays out Beijing's vision for
utilizing the region's natural resources and shaping Arctic governance.

Beijing has sought to access the region largely through scientific and
commercial ventures, which officials claim give it the "right to speak"
on Arctic affairs.

While [China\'s **Arctic research** is **primarily** focused on
**advancing scientific knowledge**]{.underline}---[contributing to
**significant** discoveries related to **sea ice composition,** space
weather, and **marine life**]{.underline}---these accomplishments also
serve Beijing\'s broader strategic objectives.
