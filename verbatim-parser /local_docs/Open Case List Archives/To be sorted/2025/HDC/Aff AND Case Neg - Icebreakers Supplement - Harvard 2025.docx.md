[China]{.underline} has rapidly [established itself as the world's
dominant shipbuilding power, marginalizing the United States and its
allies in a strategically important industry.]{.underline} In addition
to building massive numbers of commercial ships, many Chinese shipyards
also produce warships for the country's rapidly growing navy. As part of
its "military-civil fusion" strategy, China is tapping into the dual-use
resources of its commercial shipbuilding empire to support its ongoing
naval modernization[. Foreign companies are inadvertently
helping]{.underline} to propel [China's naval buildup by buying
Chinese-made ships and sharing dual-use technologies with Chinese
shipyards.]{.underline}

 

[U.S. policymakers need to act quickly]{.underline} in coordination with
allies and partners [to address the economic and national security
threats posed by China's shipbuilding industry.]{.underline} This report
offers a detailed policy roadmap for how Washington can disrupt China's
military-civil fusion strategy, erode China's market dominance, and
increase shipbuilding capacity within the United States and key partner
countries.

China defined itself as a "Near-Arctic State" in 2019 and claimed itself
as one of the continental states closest to the Arctic Circle despite
its approximate 900-mile distance11 from the Arctic Circle. Despite its
notable geographic distance from the Arctic, the PRC claims it has the
right to address regional and global issues in the Arctic, especially in
areas it considers to directly impact Chinese security and economic
interests[. In short, the PRC possesses no geographic claim but
recognizes the region's current and potential]{.underline} value. Given
the PRC's past actions "across the DIME" with regards to
extraterritorial claims in other parts of the world, [the U.S., its
allies, and its partners should]{.underline} naturally [exercise concern
regarding Chinese ambitions]{.underline}. China's security claims in the
Arctic naturally draw international interest given its aggressive and
legally dubious claims in other parts of the world. Perhaps the most
notable and dubious declaration China's made is the now "Ten-Dash
Line"12 claims in the South China Sea (SCS). However legally
questionable, the PRC SCS claims are loosely based on printed lines
found on an old Republic of China (ROC) map. Without international legal
legitimacy, the PRC employs such map as a basis to exclude concerns and
claims of other South China Sea claimant nations. Fortunately, other
nations do appeal to international law regarding disputed claims. The
2016 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) Arbitral
Ruling ruled in favor of Philippines claim which runs counter to China's
assertions.13 [The U.S., its allies, and partners must anticipate PRC
efforts to construct claims or exert efforts to secure interests in the
polar regions]{.underline}, even with no international legal standing
and at the expense of the international rules-based order. The logic for
China's current legal and diplomatic maneuvering is involves access to
Arctic shipping routes and the energy resources to provide China
geostrategic advantages[. A 6,000-kilometer sea lane through the Arctic
provides a better option rather than the existing principal trade route
passing through the Malacca Strait and Suez Canal to European markets.
Further, the Arctic contains significant gas and oil energy reserves yet
to be fully exploited]{.underline}.14 China, therefore, relies on
shaping existing agreements or laws to justify access to the Arctic
including the use of UNCLOS.

[China's increasing dominance in the global shipbuilding industry is
emerging as one of the most significant developments in the maritime
sector]{.underline} for 2024. According to BRS, a prominent broker,
[China's shipyards have expanded their market]{.underline} share
dramatically**, [accounting for 55% of vessel deliveries, 74.7% of
newbuilding orders, and holding 58.9% of the global
orderbook]{.underline}** [in the first half of this year. This surge in
activity reflects China's growing grip on the shipbuilding market, with
plans to further increase capacity by **up to 80%** from 2024 to 2027,
as 11 shipyards expand operations.]{.underline} Additionally, mothballed
shipyards across the country have been revived to meet the rising demand
for new vessels.

[Sending three icebreakers into Arctic waters for the first time is "a
clear signal" that Beijing is serious about pursuing its great power
ambitions commercially, scientifically, diplomatically and militarily in
the polar regions,]{.underline} the co-author of a study of China's
strategic goals said in an interview with USNI News.

Aidan Powers-Riggs, a research associate for China analysis at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, [said [its
strategists](https://features.csis.org/hiddenreach/china-polar-research-facility/)
"see major shifts underway in the region's physical and geopolitical
landscape and are seeking to position China to be able to capitalize on
them."]{.underline}

[The Chinese added presence this summer when U.S. Arctic research
presence was cut short by three days. An electrical fire in a
transformer caused]{.underline} USCGC *Healy* (WAGB-20) to return to its
homeport in Seattle for repairs.

[China, describing itself as a "near-Arctic power," has steadily been
"building a physical presence through commercial and scientific
activities,"]{.underline} Powers-Riggs added. [Those moves are "key to
maintaining an influence and defending their interests there" which also
include mineral and energy exploration and development.]{.underline}

### Impact - US key to check China -- overfishing

[China\'s history of overfishing its EEZ and its current distant-water
fishing fleet raises concern for fishing]{.underline}  [in the Arctic.
Not only does China have a massive fishing fleet, but the nation is the
consumer of over]{.underline}  [one-third of the world\'s fish (Urbina,
2020).]{.underline} Thus, \"Chinese demand for fish has grown
significantly with  the rapid rise in income of many of the Chinese
population, as well as the collapse of fish stock  resources in its
near-shores" (Chang & Khan, 2021[). Due to decades of unregulated
fishing in its waters,]{.underline}  [China\'s fishing supply is
depleted (Chang & Khan, 2021). At the same time, the demand for more
fish]{.underline}  [continues to rise with China\'s growing population.
Therefore, it could be inferred that one of China\'s]{.underline}
 [goals is to gain fishing rights in the High Seas waters of the Arctic
Ocean (Zoltai, 2021). China has done so]{.underline}  [in the South
China Sea, is operating fishing vessels across the globe, and may
continue to expand fishing]{.underline}  [operations into the
Arctic.]{.underline} 

Simultaneously, as the climate warms, fish are migrating into the
pristine waters of the Arctic Ocean,  making it a prime location to fish
(Pezard, et al., 2022). [Fisheries experts claim the Bering and
Barents]{.underline}  [Seas have the world\'s most plentiful fishing
stock.]{.underline} Today, the Barents Sea is covered in ice most of
the  

year, making it difficult to fish however, climate change is quickly
affecting oceanic weather in this  region. Both seas are inaccessible
for Chinese fishing because they reside inside the Russian, Norwegian, 
and American EEZ (Biedermann, 2020). [Although China does not have
access to these regions, they have]{.underline}  [begun to seek avenues
to gain rights to fisheries in the high seas region of the Arctic
(Zoltai, 2021). ]{.underline}

Arctic fisheries are enforced by the "Arctic Five" (the United States,
Russia, the Kingdom of Denmark,  Canada, and Norway). In 2018, ten
nations with common interests in the Arctic region (including the 
"Arctic Five") collaborated to sign the Central Arctic Ocean Fishing
Agreement (CAOFA), which went into  effect in 2021 (Biedermann, 2020).
The CAOFA is scheduled to remain in effect until 2037 and \"its  purpose
is to prevent any country from fishing in the high seas portion of the
Central Arctic Ocean"  (Pezard, et al., 2022). After the ocean is
adequately assessed by scientific researchers for environmental 
sustainability and enforcement protocols are in place, the CAOFA fishing
ban will be reassessed by the  signatory nations for an extension or
objections to the current agreement (Pezard, et al., 2022).
[China\'s]{.underline}  [involvement on the CAOFA signals interest from
the Chinese government\'s to influence fisheries]{.underline}
 [governance in the Arctic region. ]{.underline}

[As of 2022, China does not have known fishing vessels in the Arctic.
However, based on the Chinese]{.underline}  [fleet\'s presence in the
Antarctic, China may also be capable of fishing in the Arctic. Also
important to]{.underline}  [note, China is heavily invested in
commercial fishing industries in the Arctic from both a monetary
and]{.underline}  [an industry perspective]{.underline}. China is an
importer of Greenlandic fish and a processor for the Alaskan fishing 

industry (Pezard, et al., 2022). Diplomatically, China partnered with
Iceland to create "a trans-shipment  center for Chinese commodities and
raw materials" (Biedermann, 2020). This center will provide China  with
direct access to natural resources and fishery stocks in the Icelandic
EEZ of the Arctic (Biedermann,  

2020). China\'s mounting involvement in the Arctic fisheries ranges from
diplomatic agreements,  environmental research policy and plans, and
involvement in the commercial fishing industry. [These]{.underline}
 [items demonstrate intent from the Chinese government to stake a claim
to the fishing grounds in the]{.underline}  [Arctic region.]{.underline}

[China\'s attempt to conquer Taiwan by force \"could be

said, speaking at the 2025 [[Shangri-la Dialogue defence

How likely is an invasion?

Experts \"disagree about the likelihood and timing of a Chinese
invasion\", said the [[Council on Foreign
Relations]{.underline}](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-china-would-struggle-invade-taiwan)
think tank.

[China has been engaging in \"unprecedented aggression and military
modernisation\", Admiral Samuel Paparo]{.underline}, the [commander of
US Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline}, told the US [[Congressional Armed
Services
Committee]{.underline}](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/4102025fulltranscript.pdf)
in April. Underscoring the seriousness of this escalation, he said
[China\'s drills around [Taiwan](https://theweek.com/tag/taiwan) are
\"not just exercises -- they are rehearsals]{.underline}\".

[While \"alarming]{.underline}\", said the [[Atlantic
Council]{.underline}](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/china-is-carrying-out-dress-rehearsals-to-take-taiwan-heres-how-the-us-should-respond/),
[this \"unfortunately reflects a broader, consistent trend\" of
escalating activities]{.underline} by the People\'s Liberation Army
(PLA), [including persistent crossings of the Taiwan Strait\'s median
line.]{.underline}

[[Data]{.underline}](https://jamestown.org/program/military-implications-of-pla-aircraft-incursions-in-taiwans-airspace-2024/)
from Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defence found [that sorties across
the Taiwanese-declared dividing line]{.underline} between Taiwan and
China have [increased]{.underline} from 953 incidents in 2021 to 3,070
in 2024.

[There are other indications Beijing is preparing to move on
Taiwan.]{.underline} [China has been stockpiling record amounts of gold,
which could be part of a strategy to defend itself from Western
sanctions in the event of an attack on Taiwan. It has also been building
a solid legal ground for a potential invasion, aiming to frame the
attack as a legitimate internal matter.]{.underline}

\"[This will help the country to delay a collective security and
economic response from the West]{.underline},\" said [[The
Sun]{.underline}](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/33858411/china-trumps-new-world-order-taiwan-invasion/).

When could an invasion happen? 

Paparo told members of
[[Congress]{.underline}](https://theweek.com/tag/congress) that the PLA
are \"stretching their legs\" to meet President [[Xi
Jinping](https://theweek.com/tag/xi-jinping)\'s military readiness goal
of being capable of taking Taiwan by force by 2027.]{.underline} That
year is seen as \"magical\" because it marks the centenary of what was
to become the People\'s Liberation Army, said Robert Fox in
[[London]{.underline}](https://theweek.com/tag/london)\'s [[The
Standard]{.underline}](https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/world-war-three-russia-china-roly-walker-army-b1173097.html).

\"Others believe [2049 is a critical date,]{.underline}\" said the CFR,
as [[Xi Jinping](https://theweek.com/tag/xi-jinping) has \"emphasised
that unification with Taiwan is essential to achieving what he calls the
Chinese Dream, which sees China\'s great-power status restored by
2049\".]{.underline}

How could an invasion start?

[Chinese military drills last year surrounded Taiwan\'s main island with
joint exercises by all branches of the PLA and \"for the first time, the
increasingly militarised Coast Guard\", said [The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/the-maps-that-show-how-chinas-military-is-squeezing-taiwan).]{.underline}

[In January, [Naval
News](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/01/china-suddenly-building-fleet-of-special-barges-suitable-for-taiwan-landings)
first reported the construction of new amphibious barges at Guangzhou
Shipyard, in southern China.]{.underline}

These new barge-like Shuiqiao ships are potentially a game-changer for
Beijing and provide \"insight into China\'s integration of its military,
paramilitary and civilian operations -- and its plans for a potential
invasion\", said [[The
Guardian]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/china-landing-barges-shuqiao-ships-what-does-this-mean-for-taiwan).

The barges feature bridges that could be used to transport tanks and
supplies over previously uncrossable land, said [[The
Telegraph]{.underline}](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/12/china-taiwan-d-day-donald-trump-barges-pla-xi-jinping-navy/),
giving them multiple fronts for an invasion and \"thinning out\"
Taiwan\'s line of defence.

[The likely strategy is to overwhelm Taiwan with a [massive attack with
little
warning](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/10/taiwan-china-hellscape-military-plan/).]{.underline}

[That would mean in the early hours of a Chinese invasion, the narrow
strait separating the island from the mainland would likely be
\"transformed into a ferocious battlefield\", said [Business
Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-taiwan-drone-swarms-uav-us-playing-catch-up-production-2024-10).
Aside from deploying more traditional weapons such as missiles or
warships, \"vast fleets of unmanned aerial and naval drones will likely
darken the skies and hide beneath waves, bringing with them a deadly
threat that Taiwan and its allies are ill-prepared to counter\". During
[Joe Biden](https://theweek.com/tag/joe-biden)\'s presidency, the US
strategy to counter this -- dubbed \"Hellscape\" -- hinged on deploying
thousands of new drones that would swarm the Taiwan Strait and keep
China\'s military busy until more help could arrive.]{.underline}

How would it play out?

Chinese action against Taiwan would be an \"[act of war that sparks a
global crisis]{.underline}\", said [[The Wall Street
Journal]{.underline}](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-heres-how-8cffdeb2).
\"[It would provoke a military response by Taiwan, force President Trump
to decide whether the US military should help defend the island, disrupt
global trade and impel European nations to impose punishing sanctions on
Beijing]{.underline}.\"

[If a conflict were to break out it would be \"a catastrophe\", said the
Economist. This is first because of \"the bloodshed in Taiwan\", but
also because of the risk of [\"escalation between two nuclear
powers\"](https://theweek.com/news/world-news/asia-pacific/954137/how-asia-became-home-worlds-most-rapid-arms-race),
namely the US and China.]{.underline}

Beijing massively outguns Taiwan, with estimates from the [[Stockholm
International Peace Research
Institute]{.underline}](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) showing
that China spent about 23 times more on its military in 2021. The PLA
also boasts more than two million active soldiers. The US is bound by
the Taiwan Relations Act to \"provide Taiwan with arms of a [[defensive
character]{.underline}](https://theweek.com/news/world-news/china/958331/how-strong-are-taiwans-military-defences)\"
and discourage China from using force or coercion to achieve its goals
regarding the island. This could see Washington drawn into any conflict
-- although there is growing scepticism in Taipei that Trump would
intervene militarily in the event of a full-blown Chinese attack.

That means any [invasion \"would be one of the most dangerous and
consequential events of the 21st century]{.underline}\", said [[The
Times]{.underline}](https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/how-likely-is-a-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-gvck968pc),
and \"[would make the Russian attack on
[Ukraine](https://theweek.com/tag/ukraine) look like a sideshow by
comparison]{.underline}\".

## Biodiversity 

### Internal link -- Arctic key 

#### Arctic Climate change harms biodiversity

Geography, University of Leeds., **2025**

Consequences", Climate -- Special Issue, 27 April, 2025,

The [Arctic encompasses the Earth's northernmost part
(]{.underline}Figure 1), also known as the [circumpolar
north]{.underline}, and consists of the following eight countries:
Canada, the United States (Alaska), Denmark (via Greenland), Russia,
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland \[62\]. While the Arctic lacks a
universally accepted southern boundary, for the purposes of this study,
we adopt the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)
definition. This definition includes all areas north of the Arctic
Circle (66° 33′N) and extends into sub-Arctic zones based on bioclimatic
and ecological characteristics, particularly the presence of permafrost,
tundra, and boreal forest systems \[39,63\]. This delineation is
consistent with other pan-Arctic ecological studies investigating
vegetation and environmental change (e.g., \[64,65\]). It is
characterised by cold winters and cool summers, with lowest temperatures
between −54 and −46 °C, and monthly average temperature is below +10 °C
\[66,67\]. [The Arctic, which was historically dominated by vast sea
ice, is experiencing rapid environmental change, including significant
ice loss due to climate warming \[68\].]{.underline} [The Arctic is
**ecologically significant**, serving as a habitat for species, such as
polar bears and Arctic foxes, and functioning as a global climate
regulator \[69\]. Rising temperatures are caused by mechanisms including
ice--albedo feedback and shifting atmospheric and oceanic patterns
\[70\]. Since 1979, these changes have resulted in a 13% per decade loss
in Arctic Sea ice, permafrost thaw, and **biodiversity** disruptions,
all of which have cascading consequences on ecosystems and global
climate patterns \[]{.underline}71,72\]. The Arctic is home to four
million people, including about 40 Indigenous groups, such as Alaska
Natives, Inuit, Sámi, Nenets, Métis, Aleut, Yup'ik, Khanty, Evenk, and
Chukchi, among others, constituting about 10% of the Arctic's population
\[37\].

While often considered remote, the [Arctic plays a large role in the
functioning of many global environmental systems]{.underline} (Post et
al. 2019; Timmermans and Marshall 2020). I[n particular, the Arctic is
involved with the regulation of global climate]{.underline} (McGuire et
al. 2006) [with important implications for the ongoing climate
crisis]{.underline} (Díaz et al. 2019). [While the Arctic may hold less
biodiversity than other biomes, **this biome's biodiversity is unique in
that it includes more than 21 000 known species of fungi, plants, and
animals that are highly adapted to life in the cold and in some cases
could not survive without it**]{.underline} (see Fig. 1; Callaghan et
al. 2004; Payer et al. 2013; Ruth et al. 2023). These adaptations come
in many forms. [For example, Arctic plants and microorganisms have
traits that make them tolerant to freezing, and Arctic animals have
developed various mechanisms such as fat storage that allow them to
tolerate frigid temperatures]{.underline} (Callaghan et al. 2004;
Guerrero and Rogers 2019). On a global scale, the Arctic is ome to 27%
of the world's marine mammal species (Payeret al. 2013) and more than
20% of the world's lichenicolous fungi species (i.e., fungi that live on
lichens; Dahlberg andBültmann 2013; Payer et al. 2013). The Arctic also
[provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds that migrate to the
Arctic]{.underline} f[rom around the globe to breed and
forage]{.underline} (Sullender2019). There is [even diversity within
Arctic sea ice where nu-merous bacteria, viruses, algae, and sea ice
infauna]{.underline} (e.g., cil-iates, nematodes, turbellarians,
crustaceans) reside (Bluhmet al. 2011; Patrohay et al.
2022).[Biodiversity is the variation that occurs throughout all life on
Earth]{.underline}. For the context of our work, we deﬁned biodiversity
as having three forms, based on the deﬁnition of the Con-vention of
Biological Diversity (CBD): genetic diversity (the genetic diversity
within species), species diversity (the num-ber of different species and
their abundances), and ecosys-tem diversity (the diversity of habitats
across space and time;CBD 2000). [Biodiversity]{.underline} is
[**essential** for the proper function-ing and productivity of
ecosystems]{.underline} as it [enables ecosystems to withstand change
through building resilience]{.underline} (Tilman 1999;Cardinale et al.
2012)[. Biodiversity also supports the food security, livelihoods,
well-being, and cultures of many peo-ple, in particular communities with
longstanding residence in the Arctic, including Indigenous Peoples
(e.g., the Inuitin Canada, Russia, Alaska, and Greenland, the Sámi in
theSápmi area of northern Europe, and many others;]{.underline}
Mustonenand Ford 2013).

communities, coastal cities, and island nations."]{.underline}

Which brings us to Setiya's second definition of an "existential
threat." Even if humanity does reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to
stave off the worst effects of climate change---and learn to adapt to
some warming that is already inevitable---[Setiya says that climate
change still threatens to **eradicate a host of human cultures,
traditions, and languages.** One example he gives is the Inuit peoples
who are indigenous to Arctic regions, and whose cold-weather culture is
under threat as the amount of ice in polar regions continues to decline.
Residents of low-lying islands face an immediate, existential threat to
their cultures as rising sea levels could submerge their
homelands.]{.underline}

["Their **entire way of life is going to be changed**," Setiya says.
"And that is going to happen whether or not we get close to the kinds of
temperature changes that threaten human extinction. **Ways of life that
have been stable for hundreds of years or longer will start
collapsing**."]{.underline}

To a philosopher like Setiya[, the term "existential" has another
meaning. It refers to big questions about the meaning of life or
humanity's place in the cosmos, which are often the domain of religion
and spirituality.]{.underline} "There\'s a kind of emotional reaction
people have when they think about the totality of human history and our
place in our little corner of the universe," he says[.]{.underline} "And
I think that sense is brought into play in a disturbing way by climate
change." [Already today, human-caused climate change has changed our
relationship with the planet we live and depend on, which Setiya says
will forever alter the way we feel about human existence.]{.underline}

[How the human species responds to this crisis, Setiya says, will not
only guide our future but also reveal much about our nature. Climate
change could worsen worrying trends such as **anti-democracy uprisings
and migrant crises** as people flee areas that are increasingly hit by
natural disasters that will be exacerbated by climate change---rising
sea levels, more frequent powerful hurricanes, and droughts that
threaten freshwater supplies, for example.]{.underline}

["The question of what happens to the human species," he says, "is, do
we make progress toward a more just and egalitarian future? Or do we end
up **descending into conflict and sectarianism and nationalism?** That
is at stake in our reaction to climate change. At stake, in turn, is how
we should feel about our own existence as a species. The answer depends
very much on whether we respond to crises like this with grace and
compassion and justice, or not."]{.underline}

### Impact - Climate change -- erratic weather 

#### Climate change is the biggest impact filter of this round -- it creates the condition for some of the most extreme weather events imaginable.

science reporter, 2024**

[Like other extreme weather events,]{.underline} [episodes of heavy
rainfall are becoming more common and more intense in many places around
the world, driven by climate change.]{.underline}

Here are [four ways]{.underline} that rising temperatures are [affecting
weather extremes.]{.underline}

1\. [More extreme rain]{.underline}

For every [1C rise in average temperature]{.underline}, the
[atmosphere]{.underline} can [hold up to around 7% more
moisture]{.underline}.

[With more moisture available, rainfall can become heavier]{.underline}.

A chart showing how record temperatures cause extreme rainfall. 1) More
heat from sun causes greater evaporation 2) More moisture forms clouds
3) Heavier rain

Scientists use computer models to simulate how individual extreme
weather events unfold in two scenarios:

today\'s world with around 1.2C of human-caused warming

a hypothetical world without human influence on the climate.

That way, they can estimate how much a particular storm, heatwave or
drought was affected by climate change.

Between October 2023 and March 2024, the UK experienced the
second-wettest such period on record.

This level of rainfall was made at least four times as likely by
human-caused warming, according to scientists at the World Weather
Attribution group (WWA).

In September 2024, deadly floods hit much of central Europe, including
Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy.

The intensity of the rainfall over four days in mid-September was made
twice as likely by climate change, the WWA says.

Climate change is also likely to have played a part in the heavy
rainfall seen in Spain in late October and early November.

[Scientists point to the influence of rising temperatures, although a
full study is needed to evaluate exactly how much of an influence
climate change had compared with naturally fluctuating weather
patterns.]{.underline}

[Globally, heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense
over most land regions due to human activity,]{.underline} according to
the UN\'s climate body, [the IPCC.]{.underline}

It says this pattern will continue with further warming.

[2. Hotter, longer heatwaves]{.underline}

[Even a small increase in average temperatures makes a big difference to
heat extremes.]{.underline}

[As the range of daily temperatures shifts to warmer levels, hotter days
become more likely and more intense.]{.underline}

\"A small shift makes a big difference\". A line chart showing how small
changes in the climate increases the probability of more hot weather and
more extreme weather.

In April 2024, temperatures in Mali rose above 48C during an extreme
heatwave across the Sahel region of Africa which was linked to increased
hospitalisations and deaths.

This level of heat would not have been possible without human-caused
climate change, according to the WWA.

Such temperature spikes will become more common in many places as the
world continues to warm.

In the UK, temperatures topped 40C for the first time on record in July
2022, causing extensive disruption. This would have been extremely
unlikely without climate change, the WWA said.

[Heatwaves can happen as a result of heat domes, which are created when
an area of high pressure stays over the same area for days or weeks,
trapping hot air underneath.]{.underline}

A graphic showing how heat domes are formed. 1) A mass of warm air
builds up in still and dry summer conditions 2) High pressure in the
atmosphere pressures the warm air down 3) The air is compressed and gets
even hotter

One theory suggests that higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has
warmed nearly four times faster than the global average - are affecting
the fast band of winds high in the atmosphere known as the jet stream,
which could be making heat domes more likely.

Is the UK getting hotter?

[3. Longer droughts]{.underline}

[Linking climate change with specific individual droughts can be
difficult, because there are lots of different factors that
affect]{.underline} [the availability of water]{.underline}.

Natural weather systems, for example, can play a key role, as was the
case with drought in southern Africa in early 2024.

But [climate change is shifting global rainfall patterns]{.underline}.
[While some of the world is getting wetter, other parts are becoming
drier, which can make them more prone to drought.]{.underline}

[And heatwaves fuelled by climate change can worsen dry conditions when
they do occur, by increasing evaporation from the soil. This makes the
air above warm up more quickly, leading to more intense
heat.]{.underline}

During periods of hot weather, increased demand for water, especially
from farmers, puts even more stress on the water supply.

In parts of East Africa, there were five failed rainy seasons in a row
between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40
years. This displaced 1.2 million people in Somalia alone.

[Climate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more
likely, according to the WWA.]{.underline}

Human-caused warming was also the main driver of drought in the Amazon
rainforest in the second half of 2023. This was the region\'s worst
drought since modern records began.

experienced the most intense levels of drought, marked in oranges and
reds.

[4. More fuel for wildfires]{.underline}

[Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world]{.underline}. [It is
difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened a specific
wildfire because other factors are also relevant, such as changes to the
way land is used.]{.underline}

[But climate change is making the weather conditions needed for
wildfires to spread more likely, the IPCC says.]{.underline}

[Extreme, long-lasting heat draws more moisture out of soils and
vegetation.]{.underline}

These tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at
an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.

Canada experienced by far its its worst wildfire season on record in
2023.

Reuters Flames reach upwards along the edge of a wildfire as seen from a
Canadian Forces helicopter surveying the area near Mistissini, Quebec,
Canada June 12, 2023.Reuters

Canada experienced by far its worst wildfire year on record in 2023

Climate change more than doubled the likelihood of the extreme \"fire
weather\" conditions in eastern Canada in May and June 2023, which
helped fires to spread, the WWA says.

[Rising temperatures may also increase the likelihood of lightning in
the world\'s northernmost forests, which can in turn trigger more
fires.]{.underline}

[The combined effects of shifting land use and climate change mean
extreme wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense
globally]{.underline}, according to the UN Environment Programme
([UNEP).]{.underline}

The number of the most extreme fires may rise by up to 50% by 2100, UNEP
suggests.

### Impact -- climate change causes war 

#### Climate change drives conflicts -- multiple factors 

**UNFCCC, 2022**

\["Conflict and Climate", UNFCCC, July 12 2022,
https://unfccc.int/news/conflict-and-climate accessed July 3 2025
HDCSW -- TW\]

[And while conflict exacerbates the effects of climate change, climate
change, at least indirectly, **drives** conflict.]{.underline} And, as
the climate crisis intensifies in the coming years and decades, more and
more people will be forced to leave their homes, as a result of
everything from desertification to rising sea levels. How will countries
cope with this influx of refugees, from for example, Pacific islands
which are submerged, and will the sharing of already scarce resources
lead to conflict?

[Andrew Harper, was appointed the UNHCR's Special Advisor on Climate
Action in 2019, to help UNHCR address the climate emergency, and better
protect and assist people forcibly displaced by the effects of climate
change and disasters.]{.underline} We spoke to him about the links
between conflict and climate change.

[How does climate change create conflict?]{.underline}

[Climate change does contribute to **increased conflict**, but this
often happens along indirect pathways. It makes the most vulnerable even
more vulnerable.]{.underline} In terms of where UNHCR is engaged, we see
that there is no group more vulnerable than those who have had to flee
their country due to conflict and are now feeling the effects of a
hostile climate. [We are also seeing that people who have been displaced
by a combination of both conflict and the consequences of climate change
and environmental degradation are extremely unlikely to be able to
return home.]{.underline}

How does climate change affect more vulnerable regions?

[We are seeing across fragile regions increased food insecurity,
urbanization (as small farm holdings no-longer remain viable following a
sequence of droughts or disasters) and **competition over resources** --
particularly water. When combined with other planetary crises such as
land degradation and over exploitation of the environment, climate
change can make an already fraught situation untenable]{.underline}. 90
per cent of the world's refugees originate from countries that are
already impacted by the climate emergency and/or have the least capacity
to adapt to an increasingly hostile environment. The latter is
particularly important[; while climate change impacts every single
square meter of this earth, it does not impact everyone equally. And
unfortunately, it is those states who have often contributed the least
to global emissions, who are very much at the forefront of feeling the
impacts of the emergency.]{.underline}

Why is that the case?

They don't have the means to adapt and prepare[. States who are plagued
by poor governance, lethargic development, and a lack of social
investment in key elements such as education, health and the rule of
law, are also unlikely to be able to put in the necessary investment to
protect the environment. \[They are also unlikely to be able to\]
support preparedness and adaptation programmes, particularly for those
on the margins of society. Adapting to, and mitigating, climate change
can also play an important role in addressing many drivers of conflict
and building peace.]{.underline}

As we see resources such as water dwindle, and severe weather-related
events become more common, is a rise in the number of climate-change
related conflicts inevitable?

[The relationship between climate change, conflict and displacement is
complex and context specific -- over-simplification may lead to
inappropriate or ineffective action. That being said, unless we invest
more in supporting those communities that are on the front lines of the
climate emergency, to better adapt and prepare for the unavoidable surge
in extreme weather events, then there is likely to be an **increase in
the pre-conditions for conflict and violence** to take place. In this
regard I am talking about the ongoing droughts in many parts of the
world, unpredictable rainfall patterns (where there is either not enough
or too much rain), the consequent threat to food security, exacerbated
by the current conflict in Ukraine \[Ukraine and Russia are two of the
biggest exporters of agricultural commodities, such as wheat, in the
world\], and the pressure on climate sensitive livelihoods, such as
pastoralists or small farm holdings. The inability of governments to
meet their social contracts/obligations, to provide the most essential
services could, and is in a number of locations, leading to the
emergence of non-state actors \[such as militant groups\]. However, the
lack of human security and wellbeing of those most impacted by climate
change is already wreaking havoc for communities all over the
world.]{.underline}

Is there hope to change this narrative?

Very little is inevitable[. If we can anticipate future risks, and given
sufficient political will, we **can mitigate** some of the foreseen
consequences. However, we are **not working fast enough**.]{.underline}
There are 3.3-3.6 billion people living in hotspots of high
vulnerability to climate change mainly in Africa, South Asia,
South/Central America and Small Island Developing States. There are
increasing gaps between adaptation action taken and what's needed, with
the largest gaps among lower income populations[. Without urgent, at
scale responses that reduce vulnerability in communities and countries
facing the worst impacts, we will see **more conflict, more displacement
and more suffering**.]{.underline}

[Global Crisis and Challenge 11: growing economic inequality, social and
racial injustice, and more poverty. ]{.underline}

As all of the above global challenges and emergencies worsen and climate
change accelerates, [there will be rapidly growing economic inequality,
social and racial injustice, and more poverty. Today, less than 1% of
the world\'s population owns more than 50% of all wealth. Over the last
several decades, this ownership percentage has continued to grow in
favor of the wealthy. Growing economic inequality and poverty often
increase food shortages and cause food prices to soar, leading again to
mass starvation and migrations. This year (2020,) 130 million people are
lacking adequate food and could starve to death.]{.underline}
COVID-19\'s effect on the world economy could double that number in the
next few years. [Over the following decades, global heating consequences
will raise that number into the hundreds of millions, eventually rising
well past a billion.)]{.underline}

### Impact -- melting ice disease 

#### Climate melting ice releases infectious diseases via viruses

Technical Engineering College, 25**

[Health risks affected by climate change include melting polar ice in
addition to elevated ocean levels]{.underline}. [The thawing process of
ice will activate viruses which have been frozen in place for multiple
millennia]{.underline}. [Humanity might encounter a fresh danger because
of these conditions]{.underline}. [Rising sea levels would force coastal
inhabitants to relocate creating more population density inside cities
alongside greater risks of infectious diseases]{.underline} (Patz et
al., 2005).

The Impact of Climate Change on the Spread of Viruses

Changing Distribution of Infectious Diseases

[Temperature and humidity changes due to climate change alter the
distribution of infectious diseases because they create new
conditions]{.underline} for illness transmission in specific areas.
[Mosquitoes which transmit diseases like malaria and dengue fever now
colonize previously unsuitable areas because of temperature
elevation]{.underline} (Rocklöv & Dubrow, 2020). The alteration of
rainfall patterns in flood-prone areas can lead to higher mosquito
numbers in those regions. [Animals now have higher probabilities to
transmit viral infections to human populations]{.underline}. Climate
change raises the risk that viruses will transit from animals to humans
through zoological transmission. [The shifting ecosystems make animals
relocate for food and shelter purposes thus raising their contact
frequency with human populations]{.underline}. Human beings face an
increased risk of viral transfer from animals to their population
because of boosted human-animal interactions,[according to Jones et
al.]{.underline} (2008) [when studying COVID-19 and Ebola virus
cases]{.underline}.

Emergence of New Diseases

[Climate change will create new unknown diseases which may occur.
Changes in environmental conditions enable new viral infections while
existing viruses develop stronger human-transmissible
qualities]{.underline}. [Melted Arctic ice may release old viruses that
remained trapped in ice for thousands of years thereby creating a new
threat for human civilization]{.underline} (Revich & Podolnaya, 2011).

### Impact -- climate causes extinction 

#### Climate change non-linear tipping points and positive feedback loops risks extinction -- action needed in face of uncertainty 

**Spratt**, Research Director Breakthrough National Centre for Climate
Restoration**, 2023**

\[David, "Faster Than Forecast, Climate Impacts Trigger Tipping Points
In The Earth System, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists," Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, April 19^th^,

HDCSW-AH, 07-02-2025\]

"**[Could anthropogenic climate change result in worldwide societal
collapse or even eventual human extinction?]{.underline}** At present,
this is a dangerously underexplored topic ... yet there are **[ample
reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global
catastrophe]{.underline}**," wrote the eminent Australian climate
scientist Will Steffen and his colleagues in August 2022 in "Climate
Endgame: Exploring catastrophic climate change scenarios."

Steffen, who died earlier this year, will be remembered for some of the
big, crucial ideas he contributed to the understanding of the Earth
system, particularly **[planetary boundaries, tipping point
vulnerabilities and cascades, risk and nonlinearity, and the "hothouse
Earth]{.underline}**" scenario---ideas developed with Tim Lenton, Johan
Rockström, Katherine Richardson, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, and others.

In their 2018 "hothouse" paper, Steffen and his colleagues explored the
**[potential for self-reinforcing feedbacks to push the Earth System
toward a planetary threshold that]{.underline}**, if crossed, "could
**[prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature
rises and cause continued warming on a 'Hothouse Earth' pathway even as
human emissions are reduced."]{.underline}**

This **[challenged the notion that climate warming was a predictable,
linear consequence of increasing levels of greenhouse gases, and instead
pointed to critical thresholds, or tipping points, in which a small
change causes a larger, more critical change to be
initiated]{.underline}**, taking the climate system as a whole or
particular systems within it from one state to a discretely different
state. The **[loss of polar glaciers]{.underline}**, or the **[Amazon
rainforest drying]{.underline}** and being replaced by sclerophyll
forest, are examples.

**[The change may be abrupt or non-linear]{.underline}**---characterized
by sudden change rather than smooth progress---**[and irreversible on
relevant time frames.]{.underline}**

It may also lead to **[cascading events in which the mutual interaction
of individual climate tipping points and/or abrupt changes lead to more
profound changes to the entire system]{.underline}**. This is already
happening. The **[loss of sea ice in the Arctic is adding to regional
warming, accelerating ice melt from Greenland, such that an influx of
cold, non-salty water into the North Atlantic is slowing the Gulf
Stream, which in turn is changing the Amazon climate.]{.underline}**

**[Recent research has confirmed that tipping points and cascades are
already occurring]{.underline}**, **[not at 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius of
warming, but right now]{.underline}**. In one of his last published
pieces, a 2022 book chapter, Steffen said, "**[it is clear from
observations of climate change-related impacts in Australia
alone]{.underline}**---the massive bushfires of the 2019-2020 Black
Summer, the **[third mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in only
five years]{.underline}**, and long**[-term cool-season drying of the
country's southeast agricultural zone]{.underline}**---that even a 1.1°C
temperature rise has put us into a dangerous level of climate change."

**[While observed warming has been close to climate model projections,
the impacts have in many instances been faster and even more extreme
than the models forecasted. William Ripple]{.underline}** and his
co-researchers show that **[many positive feedbacks are not fully
accounted for in climate models.]{.underline}**

And prominent climate scientist Michael Mann says that when it comes to
certain important consequences of warming, including ice sheet collapse,
sea level rise, and the rise in extreme weather events, **["the
\[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\] reports in my view
have been overly conservative, in substantial part because of processes
that are imperfectly represented in the models."]{.underline}**

In September 2022, Stockholm University's David Armstrong McKay and his
colleagues **[concluded that even global warming of 1-degree Celsius
risks triggering some tipping points, just one data point in an alarming
mountain of research on tipping points presented in the last year and a
half.]{.underline}**

Denman Glacier, in East Antarctic, was identi fied as susceptible to
collapse of its ice shelf and inundation of the glacier itself, which
sits on a retrograde base below sea level. Scientists announced that the
Thwaites Glacier ice shelf in West Antarctica was fracturing and likely
to result in a speeding up of the glacier's flow and ice discharge,
possibly heralding the collapse of the glacier itself and triggering
similar increases across the Amundsen Sea glaciers. "The final collapse
of Thwaites Glacier's last remaining ice shelf may be initiated ...
within as little as five years," they said.

In November 2022, the State of the Cryosphere report concluded that more
than **[four meters of additional sea level rise was locked
in]{.underline}** "with sections of the West Antarctic ice sheet
potentially collapsing even without any further emissions over the
coming centuries." An ingenious look at the genetic history of Turquet's
octopus and its population movement across Antarctica in past warm
periods led to the conclusion that "**[even under global heating of
1.5°C---the most ambitious goal under the global Paris climate
agreement---the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be consigned to
collapse."]{.underline}**

In August, researchers showed that the **[Arctic has warmed nearly four
times faster than the globe since 1979 and concluded it is likely
climate models systematically tend to underestimate this
amplification]{.underline}**. A few months later, scientists reported
that **[Greenland Ice Sheet glaciers are melting 100 times faster than
previously calculated]{.underline}**. At the end of 2021, Professor
Jason Box said that the **[Greenland Ice Sheet has passed a tipping
point]{.underline}**: "Technically, now \[at 1.2°C\] **[Greenland is
beyond its viability threshold]{.underline}**... 1**[.5°C would mean the
'beyond the threshold' state is enhanced and the loss \[of ice mass\]
becomes a complex, non-linear, amplified response guaranteeing the ice
sheet remains beyond its viability threshold."]{.underline}**

**[Permafrost carbon emissions and the feedback loops they will initiate
are not accounted for in most Earth system models or Integrated
Assessment Models]{.underline}**, **[including those which informed the
IPCC's special report on global warming of 1.5 degrees
Celsius]{.underline}**, **[nor are they fully accounted for in global
emissions budgets]{.underline}**. **[If]{.underline}** **[carbon-cycle
feedbacks such as tipping points in forest ecosystems and abrupt
permafrost thaw are accounted for, the estimated remaining budget for
carbon emissions could disappear altogether.]{.underline}**

In a ground-breaking 2021 paper, Northern Arizona University's Katharyn
Duffy and colleagues mapped the **[relationship between increasing
temperatures and carbon uptake in Amazon forests by analyzing more than
20 years of data on the transfer of carbon dioxide between plants, land,
and the atmosphere; their analysis showed that in recent hot periods the
thermal maximum for photosynthesis had been exceeded.]{.underline}** At
higher temperatures, the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants
(photosynthesis) will decline sharply, whilst carbon dioxide released by
plants (respiration) will continue to rise.

In addition, recent evidence shows **[human fossil fuel emissions are
still rising and will not likely plateau until the end of this
decade,]{.underline}** a far cry from the "carbon law," which
**[requires halving emissions by 2030 to keep warming to under a
2-degree Celsius trajectory]{.underline}**. Current analysis suggests
**[the world is heading to around 3 degrees Celsius of
warming]{.underline}**, or perhaps 3.5 degrees Celsius in a plausible
high-end trajectory.

There are fair and reasonable concerns that focusing on worst-case
scenarios will cause public despair and paralysis. But when risks are
existential, it is precisely those high-end possibilities of system
collapse, rather than the middle-of-the-road linear probabilities, that
must be the focus of concern and should spur the world to action.

Speaking in 2018, Steffen said that the dominant **[linear,
deterministic framework for assessing climate change is flawed,
especially at higher levels of temperature rise]{.underline}**. Model
projections that don't include these feedback and cascading processes
"become less useful at higher temperature levels... or, as my co-author
John Schellnhuber says, we are making a big mistake when we think we can
'park' the Earth System at any given temperature rise -- say 2°C -- and
expect it to stay there."

[Climate change is causing significant environmental changes in the
Arctic, with far-reaching consequences beyond its borders]{.underline}
\[1\]. [The Arctic has become a major area of global climate
research]{.underline} in recent decades, [owing to its increased
sensitivity to warming and crucial role in controlling planetary climate
systems]{.underline} \[2,3,4,5,6,7,8[\]. The Arctic is warming at a rate
nearly four times faster than the global average, a phenomenon known as
Arctic amplification]{.underline} \[9\]. This phenomenon is attributed
to complex feedback mechanisms, such as the ice--albedo effect and
shifts in atmospheric and oceanic dynamics \[10,11,12\]. [These
processes accelerate regional warming and contribute to systemic changes
in Arctic ecosystems, atmospheric circulation, and global climate
regulation]{.underline} \[6,13\].

[The rapid loss of Arctic Sea ice is one of the most prominent
manifestations of environmental changes. Recent studies have documented
unprecedented reductions in sea ice extent, with projections indicating
a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean as early as the mid-21st
century]{.underline} \[5,6,14\]. [This phenomenon has a cascading effect
on **global climate systems**, affecting oceanic circulation, weather

### Impact -- permafrost risk positive feedback loops 

#### Permafrost Contains Methane and Carbon Which would Harm the Environment

atmosphere]{.underline}. [Loss of permafrost may radically change the
water and carbon cycle,]{.underline} significantly [affecting climate
change]{.underline} through feedback.   

[Methane is a]{.underline} much [more potent greenhouse gas than carbon
dioxide]{.underline}, although it does not remain in Earth\'s atmosphere
as long. Once the organic matter within these landscapes decomposes and
releases these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, there is no putting
them back. 

Permafrost also lies beneath the Arctic Ocean, known as submarine or
subsea permafrost, where vast reserves of geological methane are
hibernating in an icy form known as methane clathrates. Scientists are
concerned that, as the subsea permafrost thaws, this geologic methane
could be quickly released to the atmosphere.

[Although permafrost can be thousands of years old, it is sometimes
newly formed or about to thaw, and it often exists close to the melting
point, making it particularly sensitive to even minor increases in
temperature.]{.underline} In the case of subsea permafrost, changes in
ocean temperature can lead to thawing. So despite its name, instability
is a part of permafrost. 

[In some areas, permafrost contains up to 80 percent ice. When this ice
melts, the ground can collapse. This jeopardizes structures, triggers
landslides, and feeds climate change]{.underline} feedbacks. Knowing
where permafrost lies influences how buildings, roads, and other
structures need to be built. For instance, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
System has 676 kilometers (420 miles) of above ground segments, where
permafrost lies. As frozen ground thaws, pipelines, buildings, roads,
airports, and factories are likely to be vulnerable to structural
damage, requiring significant investments in repair and maintenance.
[Understanding permafrost, therefore, is important to civil engineering
and architecture. ]{.underline}

[It also determines the way of life for many communities from building
cool cellars to store perishable food to how resources are delivered to
those living in the Arctic and beyond.]{.underline}

[We are on the brink of an **irreversible** climate disaster. This is a
**global emergency**]{.underline} beyond any doubt. Much of the very
fabric of life on Earth is imperiled. We are stepping into a critical
and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis. For many years,
[scientists]{.underline}, including a group of more than 15,000, [have
sounded the alarm about the impending dangers of climate change driven
by increasing greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem change]{.underline}
(Ripple et al. 2020). For half a century, [global warming has been
correctly predicted even before it was observed]{.underline}---and not
only by independent academic scientists but also by fossil fuel
companies (Supran et al. 2023). [Despite]{.underline} these [warnings,
we are still moving in the wrong direction; fossil fuel emissions have
increased to an all-time high, the 3 hottest days ever occurred in July
of 2024]{.underline} (Guterres 2024), and current policies have us on
track for approximately 2.7 degrees Celsius (°C) peak warming by 2100
(UNEP 2023). Tragically, [we are failing to avoid serious impacts, and
we can now only hope to limit the extent of the damage]{.underline}. We
are witnessing [the grim reality of]{.underline} the [forecasts as
climate impacts escalate]{.underline} [bring]{.underline}ing [forth
scenes of unprecedented disasters around the world and **human and
nonhuman suffering**]{.underline}. [We find ourselves amid]{.underline}
an abrupt climate upheaval, [a dire situation never before encountered
in the **annals of human existence.**]{.underline} We have now brought
the planet into climatic conditions never witnessed by us or our
prehistoric relatives within our genus, Homo (supplemental figure S1;
CenCO2PIP Consortium et al. 2023).

[Last year, we witnessed record-breaking sea surface
temperatures]{.underline} (Cheng et al. 2024), [the hottest Northern
Hemisphere extratropical summer in 2000 years]{.underline} (Esper et al.
2024), and the breaking of many other climate records (Ripple et al.
2023a). Moreover, [we will see much more extreme weather in the coming
years]{.underline} (Masson-Delmotte et al. 20  i@21). Human-caused
carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases are the primary
drivers of climate change. [As of 2022, global fossil fuel combustion
and industrial processes account for approximately 90% of these
emissions, whereas land-use change, primarily deforestation, accounts
for approximately 10%]{.underline} (supplemental figure S2).

remain in feedback mechanisms, such as permafrost--carbon interactions,
the function of short-lived climatic forcers, and the impact of Arctic
changes on mid-latitude weather patterns]{.underline} \[18,41[\]. In
addition, the inadequate inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in research
and governance frameworks impedes the development of effective and
equitable adaptation strategies \[32,42\].]{.underline} [Addressing
these key gaps is important, considering the rapid pace of environmental
change in the Arctic and its global implications.]{.underline} This
review synthesises insights from recent studies on Arctic climate change
and its impacts, providing a comprehensive overview of emerging trends
and challenges. By integrating findings from diverse disciplines, this
paper aims to advance our understanding of Arctic processes, identify
important research priorities, and facilitate the development of
strategies to mitigate and adapt to the rapid transformations that are
occurring. In doing so, this review not only contributes to advancing
Arctic science but also highlights the Arctic's significant role in the

[Understanding the dynamics of these changes is important]{.underline}
not only for forecasting the course of Arctic change, but also [for
assessing their implications for global climate systems, biodiversity,
and communities]{.underline}. [Indigenous communities in the Arctic are
particularly sensitive to these changes \[29,30,31\], facing
**disruptions** to **traditional subsistence practices**,
**infrastructure** **damage** caused by permafrost thaw, and challenges
from shifting ecological and socioeconomic conditions]{.underline}
\[32,33,34,35[\]. The opening of Arctic shipping routes and increased
potential for resource extraction demonstrate its growing geopolitical
importance]{.underline} \[15,36\].

[The Arctic has a population of approximately 4 million people, of whom
approximately 10% are Indigenous, living in Alaska, Canada, Finland,
Greenland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden]{.underline} \[37,38\]. Different
nations refer to Indigenous Peoples in a diversity of ways, including
"native" in Alaska, First Nations, Inuit, and Metis in Canada (and also
"aboriginal"), Sámi in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia, Inuit in
Greenland, and Aleuts and Nenets, among others, in Russia \[39\].
[Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic encompass a heterogeneity of cultures,
worldviews, traditions, ethnicities, and biophysical
environments]{.underline} \[40\]. [This spectrum of identity is often
underpinned by a strong relationship and cultural commitment to the
significance of ancestral lands. In many regions, Indigenous Peoples
continue to live in small, remote settlements with livelihoods and
**cultural identities closely linked to traditional** hunting, fishing,
herding, and trapping activities.]{.underline}

[Indigenous knowledge holders\' observations are important for
understanding the impact of climate change]{.underline} on ecosystems
and societies, and [they have observed unprecedented temperature
increases, altered precipitation patterns, and changed weather patterns
in the Arctic, affecting both terrestrial and marine
environments]{.underline} (Savo et al. 2016; Reyes-García et al. 2024).
Arctic societies have shown resilience to climate change, but
[vulnerabilities are emerging due to changing environmental conditions
and socioeconomic pressures]{.underline} (Ford et al. 2021). [Radon, a
leading cause of lung cancer, has higher death rates in Arctic
communities]{.underline} (Glover and Blouin 2022). [The thawing of
permafrost due to climate change could expose a large Arctic population
to dangerous levels of radon, leading to increased cancer
cases]{.underline}. This would impact health services, building codes,
and ventilation advice (Glover and Blouin 2022). [Livelihoods and
cultural activities linked to subsistence harvesting have been impacted
by changes to wildlife, worsened by long-term land dispossession and
landscape fragmentation]{.underline} (Ford et al. 2021). [Snow cover
duration in the Arctic has shortened by 2 to 4 days per
decade]{.underline}, while [sea ice extent and volume have decreased,
contributing to global sea-level rise]{.underline} (Box et al. 2019).
[Higher temperatures and drier conditions have increased the risk of
wildfires, disrupting the carbon cycle and affecting Arctic
ecosystems]{.underline} (Romanovsky et al. 2017;Vihma et al.
2016).[Arctic communities are experiencing the effects of climate change
due to their dependence on climate sensitive resources and environments
for livelihoods, such as wildlife and sea ice]{.underline}, and the
cultural significance of harvesting, preparation, consumption, and
sharing (Kenny et al. 2018). The increased activities in the Arctic have
[led to a range of environmental consequences impacting the
sustainability and cultural considerations of inhabitants in states of
Norway,Russia, USA/Alaska, Canada, and Greenland/Denmark]{.underline}.
These changes have widespread consequences for local communities,
[affecting their livelihoods, wellbeing, and food security]{.underline}
(Huntington et al. 2023; Osmundsen 2023; Richardet al. 2023). [Arctic
coasts are experiencing rapid change]{.underline}, particularly during
the sea ice-free period. [The erosion of permafrost coasts in Alaska,
Canada, and Siberia has doubled since the early 2000s due to
anthropogenic warming]{.underline} (Irrganget al. 2022). [The
livelihood, health, and cultural identity of Arctic communities are
impacted, as are their access to food availability, herding, hunting,
fishing, foraging, and gathering places]{.underline} (Meredith et al.
2019). Consequently, these communities have encountered compromised food
security, escalating risks linked to traditional practices like hunting,
fishing, and trapping, and constraints on hunting during specific
periods(Ford and Pearce 2010; Harper et al. 2012). [These circumstances
have affected mental health and are linked to the occurrence of
ecological grief due to ecological losses]{.underline} caused by
environmental change (Cunsolo and Ellis 2018).

## Deterrence Scenario 

### Brink -- Great Power competition in Arctic 

#### Arctic's changes increases chance of great power competition-Russia proves

**Brady,** national defense fellow in forward defense at the Atlantic
Center's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security,**25**

\[Aaron, "Greenland's Military Possibilities for the United States", War
on the Rocks, 4/4/25,
https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/greenlands-military-possibilities-for-the-united-states/,HDCSW-KGrid\]

As [great power competition intensifies, geostrategy takes on a renewed
importance]{.underline}. Historically, the [Arctic's harsh geography
blocked most ships, allowing only the smallest, best-equipped vessels to
navigate its waters. Aircraft, missiles, and submarines eventually
operated there, but surface ships remained confined to limited areas
during summer, and land travel remains extremely difficult.]{.underline}

[Today]{.underline}, [shrinking sea ice and expanding icebreaker fleets
(especially Russia's) are opening new shipping routes,]{.underline}
primarily in the Eastern Hemisphere. [Once a restricted space, the
Arctic now provides a growing maritime link between the Pacific and the
Atlantic, expanding strategic maneuverability, particularly for
Russia.]{.underline}

[Moscow aggressively claims vast Arctic territories]{.underline} and
[has heavily invested in building a formidable Arctic military presence.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine proves its willingness to use force in
territorial disputes]{.underline}. Expanding access and growing military
capabilities are making the Arctic increasingly volatile. While [Russia
has not yet destabilized the region, provocative actions, such as
dropping paratroopers near the North Pole, signal its willingness to
escalate]{.underline}. [Competitio]{.underline}n in the high north [will
only intensify.]{.underline}

In a conflict, [Russia's expanding Arctic maneuver space and long-range
missile capabilities pose a major security challenge. Opening seas allow
Russian and Chinese forces to move between the Pacific and Atlantic,
while aircraft and naval vessels can launch long-range missile strikes
on North America]{.underline} or the North Atlantic [from the relative
safety of Russian-controlled waters and airspace.]{.underline}

More concerning, [Russia and China are rapidly developing "precise mass"
--- autonomous air, sea, and undersea forces]{.underline}. [China is
building the first drone aircraft carrier, while Russia already operates
autonomous maritime vehicles.]{.underline} [The Russian Sarma autonomous
undersea vessels can conduct long-endurance missions, enabling a
persistent Russian presence unmatched by occasional American, Canadian,
or Danish patrols.]{.underline}

\<\<PHOTO OMMITTED\>\> [Long-simmering conflicts have exploded into war
in Ukraine and Iran, pushing foreign policy to the top of everyone's
mind.]{.underline} In Alaska, we must also be vigilant to another
brewing geopolitical hotspot, the melting Arctic.

[Arctic competition is exacerbated by climate change. When most
Americans think about climate change, they picture
[rising](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/?intent=121#:~:text=Global%20sea%20levels%20are%20rising,of%20seawater%20as%20it%20warms)
sea levels, extreme heat, and worsening wildfires. But nowhere in the
United States is climate change more pronounced---or more
consequential---than in Alaska. Rapid permafrost melt and coastal
erosion are reshaping the landscape, while retreating sea ice is
exposing our coasts to new vulnerabilities.]{.underline}

 

[For most of Alaska's modern history, our frozen northern waters have
served as a [natural
barrier](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/inside-navy-submarine-arctic.html).
Ice kept adversaries at bay, making the region largely
inaccessible.]{.underline} That is no longer the case. [Melting sea ice
is opening new maritime routes and operational access points for
adversaries, increasing the strategic relevance --- and exposure --- of
Alaska's coast.]{.underline}

 

These threats are not speculative. In recent years, [Russia and China
have increased their military cooperation and presence in Arctic and
Pacific waters, including [joint
patrols](https://news.usni.org/2023/08/06/russian-chinese-warships-operated-near-alaska-say-senators)
near the Aleutian Islands and in the Bering Sea.]{.underline} The
Pentagon has explicitly warned that China seeks to become a polar power,
leveraging Russia's Arctic infrastructure and military coordination. In
parallel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently
[[emphasized]{.underline}](https://www.state.gov/secretary-marco-rubio-with-megyn-kelly-of-the-megyn-kelly-show/)
that the melting Arctic is rapidly becoming a key global shipping
corridor---and a zone of strategic competition.

 

While [Greenland has received significant international attention
lately, Alaska's strategic importance is unmatched and our leaders must
act accordingly. That means upgrading critical infrastructure, investing
in additional polar-capable icebreakers, and expanding radar and missile
defense assets positioned across Alaska.]{.underline} Our current
posture --- centered on [aging platforms and training facilities --- is
no longer sufficient.]{.underline}

 

[Deterring adversaries like China and Russia in the Arctic will require
a sustained, bipartisan commitment to modernize U.S.]{.underline} Arctic
defense capabilities. But addressing the symptoms alone is not enough
--- we must also confront the root causes.

 

Climate change is not only accelerating Arctic instability but also
compounding global threats to U.S. national and economic security.
Mitigating the worst effects of climate change is thus a national
security imperative. 

Further, we need stable, forward-looking federal policies that support
investment in next-gen energy that can slow melting, from carbon capture
to hydrogen to advanced nuclear. It's critical we update, not upend,
energy tax policies so we can accelerate these kinds of job-creating
innovations being developed right here in Alaska.

We also need to hold foreign polluters accountable --- especially China,
which produces nearly a third of global carbon emissions and disregards
modern environmental standards. That's why last year the Alaska Senate
passed [[a
unanimous]{.underline}](https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/u-s-should-hold-russia-china-to-clean-production-standards-alaska-senate-says/)
resolution urging Congress to hold major global polluters responsible.

 

Encouragingly, Alaska's congressional delegation has made Arctic
security a central focus. Sen. [Lisa Murkowski, co-chair of the Senate
Climate Solutions Caucus, continues to advocate for Arctic defense
investments and climate resilience. Sen. Dan Sullivan has rightly
[sounded the
alarm](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-statement-after-us-military-responds-to-russian-chinese-activity-near-alaska)
on foreign military threats along Alaska's coasts. And Rep. Nick Begich
has
[echoed](https://alaskapublic.org/news/politics/washington-d-c/2025-02-20/alaska-has-become-too-federally-dependent-congressman-begich-tells-state-legislature)
support for President Trump's call to expand the U.S. icebreaker
fleet.]{.underline}

 

As a young American and lifelong Alaskan, I'm heartened that our leaders
are stepping up. Defending America's Arctic frontier --- and addressing
the root drivers of insecurity --- requires bipartisan resolve,
climate-conscious policymaking, and bold leadership.

 

[In a rapidly changing world, vigilance is not a luxury. It is a
necessity.]{.underline}

[The Arctic is under stress]{.underline}, that much is known. Between
1979 and 2021, the region [warmed four times faster than the global
average,]{.underline} with effects --- [as yet poorly
understood]{.underline} --- on its ecology and ability to store carbon,
on global sea levels and on wider [ocean-circulation and weather
patterns.]{.underline}

[Add in the effects of biodiversity loss and pollution, and people often
refer to a triple planetary crisis. I think we should actually be
talking about a quadruple crisis]{.underline}. Since starting research
in the Arctic in 1997, I have spent nearly all of my summers there,
monitoring changes in pollution levels, habitats and food webs using a
'One Health' approach that integrates effects on wildlife, humans and
ecosystems. And it's becoming clear that, as the A[rctic warms, its
environment degrades and human activities increase, new health threats
are emerging.]{.underline} In particular, [the Arctic is likely to
become]{.underline} a [hotbed for zoonotic diseases that spill over into
humans from other animals.]{.underline} That threat was brought home to
all of us by the COVID-19 pandemic. [We need to take seriously the
possibility that the next pandemic could come from the
north.]{.underline}

[Some 60% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. Their emergence
and spillover is in general highly interlinked with habitat degradation,
biodiversity loss and food-web changes]{.underline} --- [all of which
are present in the Arctic]{.underline}. But a [warming
Arctic]{.underline} [harbours other risks.]{.underline} [As sea ice
thaws, 'forever chemicals' are increasingly being transported into
Arctic environments]{.underline}. These include mercury, per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances and polychlorinated biphenyls, all [known to
modulate human and animal immune systems and increase vulnerability to
respiratory infections.]{.underline} Invasive fish and whale species are
also bringing in industrial chemicals and their own diseases.

[The pathogens enter an environment in which some native species, such
as polar bears (Ursus maritimus), have not been exposed to them, and so
are at increased risk]{.underline}. T[he release of ancient
microorganisms]{.underline} long [frozen in ice]{.underline} and
sediments as the landscape thaws adds to this [danger: humans and other
wildlife]{.underline} are likely to lack any immune defences against
them.

[These risk factors are set to increase]{.underline}. [The first
ice-free Arctic summers could come as early as the 2030s.]{.underline}
[The Arctic Ocean has huge potential for energy, fishery and tourism
sectors, and is not subject to any global treaty regulating its
exploitation. Further wildlife disturbance, pollution, overfishing and
jurisdictional conflicts are the likely result.]{.underline}

**[Since]{.underline}**
[**[Covid-19]{.underline}**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html)
brought the world to a standstill back in 2020, **[thoughts have turned
to what the next global pandemic could be]{.underline}.** Many
scientists are focusing their research on a hypothetical future
\'Disease X\'. But according to a new study, **[the answer could
actually lie in the Arctic]{.underline}**. **[Scientists have warned
that melting ice at the North Pole could unleash \'zombie\' viruses with
the potential to trigger a new pandemic.]{.underline}** These so-called
**[\'Methuselah microbes\' can remain dormant in the soil and the bodies
of frozen animals for tens of thousands of years.]{.underline}** But
**[as the climate warms and the permafrost thaws]{.underline}**,
**[scientists are]{.underline}** now **[concerned that ancient diseases
might infect humans.]{.underline}** Co-author Dr Khaled Abass, of the
University of Sharjah, says: [\'**[Climate
change](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html)
is not only melting ice---it\'s melting the barriers between ecosystems,
animals, and people.**]{.underline} **[\'Permafrost thawing could even
release ancient bacteria or viruses that have been frozen for thousands
of years.\']{.underline}** For over a decade, scientists known that
bacteria and viruses frozen in the Arctic could still have the potential
to infect living organisms. **[In 2014, scientists isolated viruses from
the Siberian permafrost]{.underline}** [**[and showed they could still
infect living cells despite being frozen for thousands of
years.]{.underline}**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6923367/Thawing-Siberian-permafrost-anthrax-prehistoric-diseases-come-life.html)
Similarly, in 2023, scientists successfully revived an amoeba virus that
had been frozen for 48,500 years. However, the risks are not limited to
permafrost regions, as dormant pathogens can also be found in large
bodies of ice such as glaciers. **[Last year,]{.underline}**
**[[scientists found 1,700 ancient viruses lurking deep inside a
glacier](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13793979/ancient-viruses-discovered-melting-ice.html)
in western China, most of which have never been seen
before.]{.underline}** The viruses date back as far as 41,000 years and
have survived three major shifts from cold to warm climates. While
**[these viruses are safe so long as they remain buried in the
permafrost, the big concern for climate scientists is that they may not
remain that way for long.]{.underline}** **[When ice or permafrost is
disturbed or melts, any microbes inside are released into the
environment - many of which could be dangerous.]{.underline}** For
example, researchers discovered an ancient relative of African swine
fever virus, *Pacmanvirus lupus* was found thawing from the
27,000-year-old intestines of frozen Siberian wolf. Despite having been
frozen since the Middle Stone Age, this virus was still capable of
infecting and killing amoebas in the lab. Scientists estimate that four
sextillion - that\'s four followed by 21 zeros - cells escape permafrost
every year at current rates. While **[researchers estimate that only one
in 100 ancient pathogens could disrupt the ecosystem, the sheer volume
of microbes escaping makes a dangerous incident more
likely.]{.underline}** In 2016, for example, anthrax spores escaped from
an animal carcass that had been frozen in the Siberian permafrost for 75
years, leaving dozens hospitalized and one child dead. **[Yet the bigger
risk is that the disease becomes established in the animal population,
where increasing contact with humans makes it more likely that the
disease will jump into humans as a \'zoonotic\' disease.]{.underline}**
According to the researchers, about three-quarters of all known human
infections are zoonotic, including those found in the Arctic. [If a
zoonotic disease emerged from a dormant state in the frozen Arctic, our
bodies might not have the defences needed to fight an
infection.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} type of infection **[could
lead to a particularly dangerous and hard-to-control
pandemic.]{.underline}** Dr Abbas says: \'Climate change and pollution
are affecting both animal and human health---our research looked into
how these two forces are interconnected. \'As the Arctic warms faster
than most other parts of the world, we\'re seeing changes in the
environment---like melting permafrost and shifting ecosystems---that
could help spread infectious diseases between animals and people.\' The
**[researchers warn that Arctic regions are an especially dangerous
starting point for a pandemic since the region has so little medical
infrastructure.]{.underline}** Health and research services are limited,
meaning a disease may spread widely before the authorities have the
chance to react. Already, [**the researchers point out that zoonotic
diseases** such as Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever and the parasite
Toxoplasma gondii **have spread throughout the Arctic
region.**]{.underline} However, Dr Abbas cautions that **[what is
happening in the Arctic \'doesn\'t stay in the Arctic\'.]{.underline}**
**[\'The environmental stressors we studied have ripple effects that
reach far beyond the polar regions]{.underline}**.\'

###  Impact -- permafrost viruses

who is part of the CLINF Nordic Centre of Excellence, a group that
investigates the effects of climate change on the prevalence of
infectious diseases in humans and animals in northern regions.

["If there is a virus hidden in the permafrost that we have not been in

is not sufficient]{.underline}," she said. "It is correct to have
respect for the situation and be proactive and not just reactive. And
the way to fight fear is to have knowledge."

[In specific Arctic regions, populations residing near glaciers face an
elevated probability of encountering novel viruses]{.underline}. For
instance, [Siberia contains burial grounds dating back to the 18th and
19th centuries situated near the Kolyma River, which potentially harbor
nucleic acids of the smallpox virus]{.underline}. Furthermore, a Stone
Age burial site was discovered in Gorny Altai, a region in close
proximity to southern Siberia (Mahadik et al., 2023). Additionally, [the
remains of individuals who succumbed to the Spanish flu were interred in
the Alaskan tundra]{.underline} (Claxton, 2017). [New viruses trapped in
the polar ice may be released as a result of environmental changes like
global warming]{.underline}. Such [new viruses could appear and cause a
terrible worldwide epidemic]{.underline}. Human-caused changes to the
environment or ecology, such as [fire or deforestation, alter the
nature-host-virus interactome and force animals to migrate to urban
areas, which can lead to interspecies transmission]{.underline} or
spillover, which [can spread or reach a global audience for a pandemic
of newer or recombinant viral pathogens]{.underline}. While locations of
this nature are not expected to harbor eradicated live viruses, [the
accelerating melt of glaciers presents a potential pathway for their
resurgence in a viable and infectious form]{.underline}. The
circumstances surrounding [an anthrax epidemic in Siberia offer a
compelling illustration of this risk]{.underline}. [Beyond hospitalizing
close to a hundred individuals, the virus tragically led to the death of
a young child]{.underline}. Subsequent inquiries determined that [the
anthrax outbreak stemmed from the exposure of lethal anthrax spores,
which were released when the frozen remains of animals infected years
earlier underwent a meltthaw cycle]{.underline} (World Economic Forum,
n.d.). These [spores had remained in a state of inactivity within the
intensely cold environment until they were freed by
meltwater]{.underline}. Despite the fact that anthrax is bacterial in
nature, [a comparable scenario could unfold with viruses that are
currently inactive within glacial ice]{.underline} (Mahadik et al.,
2023).

In recent years, [scientists have **revived** **viruses** **frozen** in
**permafrost** for tens of thousands of years. These
microbes]{.underline}, long thought dormant and harmless, [are showing
**signs** of **activity**]{.underline} in lab experiments. As climate
change accelerates the thawing of Earth\'s oldest ice, some researchers
are asking a startling question: What happens when the microbial past
collides with the modern world?

[Permafrost]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [ground]{.underline} that's
remained frozen for at least two consecutive years --- and in some
regions of the Arctic, it's been frozen for tens of thousands. It
stretches across vast expanses of Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada, and
Greenland, [acting as a **natural** deep **freezer** for **ancient**
**organic** **material**. As global temperatures rise, this permafrost
is **thawing** **faster** and deeper than expected, revealing not just
bones or moss but **biological** matter. And some of it is still
**alive**.]{.underline}

So, what exactly is emerging from the ice, and how far back does it take
us?

[In 2022, researchers in France led by virologist Jean-Michel Claverie
revived **13** **previously** **unknown** **viruses** from Siberian
permafrost. The oldest, **Pandoravirus** **yedoma**, was estimated to be
48,500 years old and still **capable** of **infecting**]{.underline}
amoebas. These findings confirmed what many scientists had long
suspected: [ancient viruses can survive in frozen conditions and remain
infectious.]{.underline}

While these viruses aren't known to infect humans, their survival raises
serious questions. If one virus can endure nearly 50,000 years in the
frozen permafrost, what else might be preserved beneath the surface?
What could happen if those microbes are reintroduced into today's
ecosystems?

### Now key time/Uniqueness -- Russia threat in Arctic 

#### Russian aggression in Arctic proves now key time to increased deterrence -- gray zone incursions prove

[Through full-spectrum means of aggression and contestation, Russia is
an acute threat to Arctic security. In broad strategic terms, Moscow
perceives the impact of climate change as a harbinger for increased
human (and therefore military) presence]{.underline} close to the Arctic
Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF).8 However, [climate change is
simultaneously perceived by Russia as a threat to their national
security as the natural protective ice barrier in Russia's North
melts]{.underline}, allowing additional access for potential adversaries
and altering cover capacities for their submarine fleet. In this, the
accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO vindicates Russia's force
posture and 'fear of encirclement' of its strategic approaches. [Whereas
Russia might have considered itself in a relative position of strength
in the region, the expansion of NATO is likely to alter Moscow's posture
and lead to more assertive actions]{.underline}.9 [Moscow constantly
considers military strategic risks]{.underline} 8 Rumer, Eugene, Richard
Sokolsky, and Paul Stronski. 2021. Russia in the Arctic -- A Critical
Examination. *Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.* 29 March
2021.\

Kendall-Taylor. 2023. How Finnish and Swedish NATO Accession Could Shape
the Future Russian Threat, *Center for a New American Security*, January
2023, 15 Unclassified and opportunities in the region and has never
excluded the possibility of a military conflict in the Arctic.10 While a
full assessment of Russian strategic objectives is beyond the scope of
this report, **[Russian strategy and deterrence objectives were
analyzed.]{.underline}** The updated Maritime Doctrine of 202211 recalls
that the AZRF and the Northern Sea Route (NSR) are 'vital areas of
national interest'. For the Kremlin, the Arctic represents a strategic
continuum stretching from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific, with
North Pole approaches in the middle. Thus, Moscow understands the Arctic
in circumpolar terms, and does not apply a sole focus on the High North.
[**Russia's reinvestment in military capabilities and infrastructure in
the region must be understood through the lens of a 'double dual'
approach: Arctic infrastructure is being used equally for civilian and
military purposes (dual-use),** while Russia's military capabilities are
blurring the lines between offensive and defensive intent
(dual-purpose).12 **Russia is sustaining a network of long-range
sensors, surface-to-air missile systems, coastal defense
systems,**]{.underline} as well as nuclear and EW capabilities aimed at
degrading Allied operations in a contested environment. **[Such
capabilities represent a threat to NATO assets in the North Atlantic and
the High North.13 Innovative approaches to deter Russian activities in
the Arctic are necessary to 1) deter incidents of a bilateral nature in
the Arctic, and 2) globally deterring Russia by putting their primary
escalation control tools]{.underline}** - strategic nuclear weapons and
capability for direct assault through other means - under pressure.
Avoiding miscalculation and tactical errors is key here as well as
avoiding risks linked to horizontal escalation from one theater to
another (especially to and from the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic).
Moreover, deterring Russia also requires Allies to better take into
consideration a combined Atlantic and Pacific approach to the Arctic --
expanding the scope beyond NATO with emphasis on the US and Canada and
other like-minded allies in the Pacific, specifically Japan. Despite
early reports that Russian forces in the Arctic were being deployed en
masse to Ukraine and some Russian naval infantry brigades faced serious
losses there -- it is assessed that few units of consequence in the
Northern Fleet and the Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research (GUGI) have
been impacted.14 In fact, while Russia's land military capabilities have
been impacted by the ongoing conflict in and around Ukraine, their air
and subsurface sea power have been strengthened through experiential
learning. The near-term implications of this are that Allied freedom to
maneuver is limited by the 'Bastionization' of the Russian Arctic.15
Whether or not Russian limitation of the Allied freedom of maneuver is
under threat is a point of disagreement within the Allies as some, such
as the United States, understand this limitation as a more serious
threat and may wish to be more forceful in order to create strategic
dilemmas for the Russians.

Others may be more hesitant and focus on the potential for an increasing
security dilemma in the Arctic if Russia's secondary strike capabilities
and bastion are perceived to be threatened. Such disagreements may not
be overt in nature but are likely to play out in the background and
determine how an Allied consensus on Arctic matters emerges. [3. Allies
anticipate increased threats of Russian hybrid and gray zone activities
to naval forces and critical Allied/national marine infrastructure at
sea and ashore. By conducting gray zone activities, Russia aims to
deter, dissuade, or mitigate Allied competitive advantages and seeks to
pressure the United States, NATO, and its partne]{.underline}**rs.**
[Russia has employed many types of gray zone activities, including
economic coercion and cyber (or disinformation) warfare.]{.underline}
There seems to be a growing pattern in Russian activities regarding the
disruption of sub-sea Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), mostly
unburied data and communication cables and pipelines. [Recent activities
in and outside the Arctic]{.underline} -- sabotage of the Nord Stream 1
and 2 pipelines, cable-cutting close to Svalbard,16damage done to cables
near the Faroe and Shetland islands,17 and drone overflights of energy
facilities in Norway,18 etc. -- [indicate that seabed warfare must
become a concern for Allies given increasing dependency on
infrastructure. Such activities are likely to increase in number and
impact, not least because they are relatively 'cheap' to conduct with a
low risk of attribution, are highly disruptive, may contribute to
strategic confusion, and impose cost on Allies. Deterring threats to
critical underwater infrastructure, Russian undersea intelligence
collection capabilities, malign activity, and securing sea lines of
communication remain a top priority. The Arctic continues to be the
nexus of undersea deterrence]{.underline}.

[Military tensions]{.underline} are [escalating because]{.underline} the
[Russian Federation]{.underline} has strengthened military
[forces]{.underline} in the Arctic [by reopening bases]{.underline} and
[installing advanced weapon systems]{.underline}. [NATO
members]{.underline} are [concerned]{.underline} [about
security]{.underline} because of these changes[, which could lead to a
new arms race in the Arctic. Resource war]{.underline} is [happening
because]{.underline} the [Arctic holds]{.underline} aroun[d 13% of the
world's undiscovered oil and 30% of the world's untapped natural
gas]{.underline}. C[ompetition over resource control is causing
significant concern.]{.underline} Shipping routes have an important role
in the security landscape because [Arctic ice is melting and creating
new sea lanes, such as the Northern Sea Route.]{.underline} The [Russian
Federation's control over the sea lanes creates problems of dependency
concerns and]{.underline} could [create problems for international trade
if the Russian Federation controlled those sea lanes.]{.underline} The
Russian Federation has made a very expansive claim to territory in the
Arctic, which, due to overlap with other countries such as Norway and
Canada, could lead to legal disputes and, perhaps, even diplomatic
battles. [Environmental risks]{.underline} that may be introduced by the
Russian Federation's engagement in the Arctic [include oil spills,
disruption to fragile habitats, and significant blowback to world
environmental leaders because]{.underline} the [Arctic
environment]{.underline} represents [a unique system of great
vulnerabilit]{.underline}y that could be adversely affected [by any
risks created such as these by the Russian Federation.]{.underline}

 The [Russian Federation]{.underline} is positioning itself in the
Arctic and a[cting about global power]{.underline} by [interfering with
established power dynamics]{.underline} and possibly [disrupting the
balance of power that exists]{.underline}, often in joint alliances
[with other members of NATO and the United States]{.underline}. [The
unique nature]{.underline} and the way t[he Russian Federation is
engaging the geography]{.underline} of the Arctic [is likely to impact
and disrupt what is already a vulnerable Indigenous community on the
frontlines of climate change]{.underline}, [which includes potential and
anticipated disruption of fairness, livelihoods, and
opportunities.]{.underline} The Arctic, a resource-rich stronghold, is
becoming the next strategic landscape for jostling global powers. The
rise of global powers such as the Russian Federation and China, and the
presence of new actors such as Beijing, are strong indicators of the
value of the Arctic as a place for global strategic competition. [NATO
has heightened its focus on the Arctic in response to Russia's
increasing military presence. This could lead to the further
militarization of the Arctic as NATO and its]{.underline} member
[states]{.underline} like Norway, Canada, and the U.S. [increase their
defensive capabilities in the region.]{.underline} Joint military
exercises, the establishment of Arctic military units, and the potential
deployment of more surveillance and defence systems could emerge as NATO
counters Russian expansion.

### Brink -- Russia icebreaker threat 

#### Eroding Russian dominance in the Arctic means now key time to make gains 

**Globle**, senior research associate at Eurocollege, **24**

\[Paul, "Russia Facing Loss Of Icebreaker Dominance In Arctic --
Analysis",Eurasia Review,7/27/24,Jesuit Nexis, HDCSW-JCP KGrid 7/1/25\]

[Russia has the longest Arctic coastline]{.underline} of any country in
the world and has viewed the Arctic both as an east-west transit route
via the Northern Sea Route and as a source of natural resources. [Moscow
also sees the region as its own territory from which others should be
excluded]{.underline}.

[Russia has long had the largest icebreaker fleet in the world. The size
of its fleet, while enormous relative to all others, even taken
together, is frequently overstate]{.underline}d. [Most of its 41
icebreakers are small and devoted to keeping ports and adjoining rivers
navigable rather than being able to project Russian power further into
the Arctic]{.underline}. Only seve[n of its ships are nuclear-powered,
and many are aging and now forced to undergo significant repairs that
keep them off-duty for months or even years]{.underline} at a time
(Sudostroenie.info, July 22).

Until recently, [Moscow had sought to compensate for its longstanding
domestic difficulties by relying on shipyards in other countries.
However, in addition to depriving Russia of the much-needed parts it
requires to repair or modernize existing ships, Western sanctions have
largely made that impossible]{.underline} (The Barents Observer,January
19, 2022,June 24). [Having lost those options, Moscow has increasingly
turned to China in hopes that the growing number of Chinese icebreakers
will work with, rather than against, Russian interests.]{.underline}
Some in [Russia, however, fear that China will help now only to turn
against Russia in the future]{.underline}, when Beijing, rather than
Moscow, could become the paramount power in the north (seeEDM, May 6,
2021;The Barents Observer, July 10).

The [deterioration of Russian relations with the West]{.underline} has
not only [cost it access to Western shipyards and spare
parts]{.underline}. It has also prompted Western countries to focus more
on the Arctic as well as other regions and take steps to ensure that
Moscow will not be in a position to threaten Western interests there.
The new US Arctic strategy document released earlier this year
highlights the need for the West to build up its icebreaker fleet to
counter threats from Moscow (seeEDM, April 4).

At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington
earlier this month, [the United States, Canada, and Finland signed an
agreement (ICE Pact)committing themselves to build 70 to 90 new
icebreakers by 2030. If this commitment is met, Russia, even together
with China, will lose its advantages in this sector well before that
time]{.underline} (The Barents Observer, July 12).

[The Arctic may provide a new front in the Cold War, raising the
possibility of military incidents or confrontation]{.underline}. [As
Arctic waters]{.underline} become more [strategically
important,]{.underline} the [United States could deploy more naval and
air force power toward the region]{.underline}, risking friction among
NATO allies, [if there are divisions over how to respond or strategize
regarding the Arctic. The Russian invitation to China for participation
in extracting Arctic natural resources forms a strategic partnership
with mutually reinforcing]{.underline} [positions for both
countries]{.underline}. China's "*Polar Silk Road*" initiative advances
Russian objectives and provides China with access to increasingly
important resources while shortening shipping routes[. The Russia-China
partnership in the Arctic creates an Eastern bloc that could challenge
Western influence, resulting in a bifurcated Arctic direction, where the
East controlled by China and Russia enjoys significant military and
natural resource advantages while the West is trying to defend its
interests. The role of China's partnership with Russia will hinder
Western efforts to economically isolate Russia and reestablish trust,
and sanctions could be partially circumvented if China.]{.underline}
Russia already controls a substantial portion of Europe's energy now,
and enhanced [Russian control of the Arctic means more leverage over
European energy strategies because of the availability of new oil and
gas reserves.]{.underline} An enhanced [Russian presence could result in
Europe's energy dependency becoming more pronounced, further
complicating diplomatic relations]{.underline} and contributing to
Europe's weakened ability to call out or act against Russian actions in
furtive kitchens in Ukraine. [Increased competition for energy in the
Arctic region may exacerbate a European energy transition timeline and
potentially lead to denser renewables as a countermeasure vis-a-vis
Russian Arctic energy control.]{.underline} Additionally, some existing
global environmental movements are already responding to Russia's
expansion, and Russia has a history of oil spills and other
environmental degradation in other parts of the world. [The fragile
ecosystems and Indigenous communities of the Arctic are already most
affected by climate change]{.underline}. Therefore, a more aggressive
economic prioritization of resources could lead to broader global
activism in response to Arctic natural resource economic exploitation
and increased diplomatic pressure.

[The Arctic venture of the Russian Federation carries a lot of
punch]{.underline} than primarily regional significance, President
Vladimir Putin endeavours [to extend The Russian Federation as a global
superpower]{.underline}. [The Russian Federation's exploitation of
massive Arctic reserves in combination with a military push to assert
dominance is not only a matter of managing resources- it is also about
displaying military power and strategic intention.]{.underline} [The
reopening of military installations]{.underline} and the roll-out of
high-tech armaments [show the Russian Federation's aspiration to
overshadow the important region]{.underline}, and in doing [so provide
itself with a strategic advantage over other countries]{.underline}.
[What the Russian Federation is doing has the capability of shifting
power relations globally.]{.underline}

It is clear to me that Vladimir Putin's main priority is to recover the
Russian Federation's former glory and secure a significant role in world
affairs. [In taking command of strategic Arctic Sea routes and
territories with substantial resource reserves, the Russian Federation's
schemes are, in a way, more about securing than economic
benefits.]{.underline} The Russian Federation wants to, with the Arctic,
expand its sphere of geopolitical influence. Based on my understanding,
the Russian Federation's Arctic ambitions contribute to its broader
objective of positioning the country as a premier global power state.
With its actions in the Arctic, it is evident that President Putin
intends to display that the era of the Russian Federation being a major
global power is past and present.

technological and capability gap.]{.underline} On April 11, 2025, the
U.S. Coast Guard issued a request for information to both domestic and

icebreaker known as the Arctic Security Cutter.

The project calls for the delivery of the first vessel within three
years of contract award[. The ship is expected to have advanced
technical features, including the ability to break through three feet of
ice]{.underline} (approximately 90 centimeters), a range of 6,500
nautical miles at 12 knots, an endurance of over 60 days, and a flight
deck with an enclosed hangar to operate an HH-60 helicopter. The program

[Currently, the U.S. Coast Guard operates only two true polar
icebreakers]{.underline}: the USCGC Healy, a research vessel

increased, prompting a \$951.6 million budget adjustment approved in
early 2025. [The long-term plan envisions a fleet of eight to nine heavy
and medium icebreakers, but delays in procurement have become a source
of concern in Washington]{.underline}.

[In contrast, Russia currently operates a vast fleet of 103
icebreakers,]{.underline} encompassing both civilian and military
vessels, including approximately [20 nuclear-powered units]{.underline}.
These ships are mainly operated by Rosatomflot, a subsidiary of the
state-owned nuclear agency Rosatom, which has also been granted
authority over Arctic navigation---previously overseen by the FSB,
Russia's internal security agency. [These nuclear-powered icebreakers
are capable of breaking ice more than 3.5 meters thick]{.underline} and
can escort commercial ships along the entire length of the Northern Sea
Route, now a strategic axis for Russian energy exports and Siberian
connectivity.

#### Uniqueness and brink -- expanding icebreaker capability key given perception of Russia dominance 

**Globle**, senior research associate at Eurocollege, **24**

\[Paul, "Russia Facing Loss Of Icebreaker Dominance In Arctic --
Analysis",Eurasia Review,7/27/24,Jesuit Nexis, HDCSW-JCP KGrid 7/1/25\]

Russian and some Western commentators have expressed skepticism about
the ability of these countries to bring such ships online so quickly, as
icebreakers typically take five or more years to construct. In Russia,
this timeline is even longer (Fond Strategicheskoi Kul\'tury, July 21).
The sharing of expertise among the three countries, however, gives
reason to believe that they---now all NATO allies---will be able to do
so.

A bigger problem is that many in both Ru[ssia and the West believe that
global warming may soon make all such construction irrelevant by leaving
the Arctic free of ice.]{.underline} This [will not be the
case]{.underline}, however, [for at least the next decade or
more]{.underline}. On the one hand, while [global warming has affected
the Arctic]{.underline} profoundly overall, it [has left some regions
and routes more at risk of ice than others]{.underline}. [Warmer winds
have sent icebergs in those directions, requiring cargo ships to be
accompanied by icebreakers. That is especially the case in the eastern
portions of the Northern Sea Route, meaning that icebreakers will be
required for some years to come]{.underline} (Profile.ru, May 31, 2022).

On the other hand, [if global warming does allow others to open
alternative routes or expand mining elsewhere in the northern
ocean]{.underline}, those [countries involved will want the defensive
capacity icebreakers give them to defend against any threats to their
interests in the Arctic]{.underline}. That is certainly the case with
the United States and Canada, but it is also true for other Arctic
states. (On alternative routes that may open up, see the map provided
atThe Barents Observer, July 12.)

Some [Russian commentators are counting on Western countries to find it
technically or politically impossible to construct 70 to 90 new
icebreakers by the end of this decade]{.underline}. They have even
proclaimed that \"[the United States has lost the icebreaker race to
Russia]{.underline},\" [even snidely adding that \"to paraphrase an
ancient author, NATO\'s ice-breaking tortoise will never catch up with
Russia\'s icebreaking Achilles\"]{.underline} (Fond Strategicheskoi
Kul\'tury, July 21). It is true that icebreakers are not the only
military asset in the North, but unless the West backs away from its new
commitments, it will be Russia and not the West that will lose this
race.

#### Unique patterns in the seas require assistance from icebreakers to reduce risks in other sectors of the economy.

**[The analysis of navigational conditions sheds light on the
relationship between sea ice dynamics and ship accessibility. The
observed inverse correlation between travel speed and sea ice depth
underscores the impact of ice conditions on maritime operations.
Ice-strengthened vessels]{.underline}**, particularly those with FS 1A
Super classification, **[demonstrate higher capability in navigating
through ice-infested regions,]{.underline}** while ships with thinner
hulls exhibit reduced flexibility and rely on safer, open-water routes.

In Figure 8, vessels like cargo ships and tankers usually carry a large
volume of goods and travel long distances. To minimize risks and costs,
their travel speed varies closely with the change in sea ice conditions.
Offshore vessels are similar but they typically do not enter the deep
Arctic Ocean (observed by having shorter tails in scatter plots) because
they usually have operational purposes including oil exploration,
construction work or providing supplies on the high seas. However,
fishing vessels do not show the same amount of decline when the FS class
moves down. Fishing vessels are shown to visit regions covered by
first-year ice (sea ice depth smaller than 1.5 metres). This could be
due to the resource richness. **[Some ice-infested regions can be
abundant in marine life, including fish species such as cod, haddock and
halibut. Fishing vessels may venture into these areas to access rich
fishing grounds and maximize their catch.]{.underline}** Finally,
passenger ships with thinner hulls or even without any ice strengthening
can also have unexpected visits to regions with first-year ice or
multi-year ice. Being scenic cruises, these **[cruises may include
excursions into ice-infested areas to provide passengers with a close-up
view of icebergs, glaciers and wildlife.]{.underline}** Although not
optimized for prolonged operation, **[they may still have safety
features and procedures in place to mitigate risks associated with
navigating including close monitoring of ice conditions and cooperation
with icebreaker escorts.]{.underline}**

In Figure 8 last column, FS II ships have been shown to access
ice-infested regions. This could be possible when they are accompanied
by additional ice breakers which are not reflected by this dataset.
Another reason is due to PIOMAS model error since the sea ice depth is a
simulated field, rather than observation. On the other hand, the FS 1A
Super (first column) shows the highest capability in terms of sailing
through ice, showing a large number of points, e.g. from cargo ships and
tankers, from waters deeply covered in multi-year sea ice (sea ice depth
larger than 1.5 metres).

Already, [Russia and China appear intent on making the Arctic a
cornerstone of their global strategy]{.underline}. In a January 2018
white paper, [China declared itself]{.underline} an "important
stakeholder in Arctic affairs" as a ["near-Arctic" state]{.underline},
[signaling its intent to claim partial ownership to the
region]{.underline}. [China cited the region's "strategic" and
"economic" importance]{.underline}, building economic and diplomatic
ties to gain legitimacy in the region. It is now the "[main source of
foreign direct investment in the Arctic]{.underline}."16 [To back its
moves, it launched its second icebreaker]{.underline}, the
20,115-horsepower Xue Long 2, [that same year]{.underline}.17 It has
announced plans for a third, high-powered heavy icebreaker.18 [Russia
has capitalized on its extensive Arctic coastline to justify the
creation of an icebreaker fleet that is now more than 40 vessels
strong]{.underline}, seven of which are nuclear-powered.19 [Russia
boasts the world's largest icebreaker]{.underline}, the Arktika,
75,000-horsepower nuclear-powered vessel, though it has been beset by
technical difficulties. [The U.S.' icebreaker fleet, by comparison, is
outdated and frequently in a state of disrepair.]{.underline}
Historically, the U.S.' icebreakers have operated under the purview of
the USCG. Currently, this fleet consists of two icebreakers, the Polar
Star and the Healy. The Healy, due to a recent onboard fire, is
currently out of commission, leaving the U.S.with one government-owned
operational icebreaker. [This disparity in the condition of America's
icebreaker fleet relative to those of its near-peer competitors has
become a cause for concern within many defense and national security
circles.]{.underline}

[The status of the U.S.' icebreaker fleet is often cited as
representative of what many perceive as a lethargic and reactionary
American strategy in the Arctic]{.underline}. In recent years, the
American national security establishment has tried to remedy this. The
Pentagon has produced two Arctic strategies since 2016, though both lack
specific policy prescriptions.21 President Donald Trump approved an
order appropriating nearly \$2 billion towards the construction of three
heavy icebreakers, the next generation of USCG icebreaking vessels the
organization calls Polar Security Cutters.

[**All** **three** ICE Pact partners have **independently** published

[**However**, these efforts in Canada and the United States have faced

#### Heavy icebreakers solve best -- need newly designed ships

HSCW, JS

[Icebreakers are emblematic of the significant gaps in the Arctic
defenses of NATO member states. U.S. President Donald Trump has
announced an aspirational interest in [acquiring at least 40 new
icebreakers](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2025/04/14/canada-finland-tout-different-paths-of-icebreaker-diplomacy-with-us/),
but the [U.S. Coast
Guard](https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-navy/2025/05/09/us-coast-guard-to-add-heavy-icebreaker-amid-shipbuilding-overhaul/)
only has two.]{.underline} Across NATO, there are thankfully 41, but 65%
of these are past their design life. Absent rapid action to recapitalize
NATO's icebreaker fleets, there could be a dramatic drop in capacity
this and the next decade.

[Recognition of the looming decline has prompted allied countries to
accelerate plans for icebreaker development, but before cutting steel,
nations should ensure that next-generation designs address a wide range
of future demands]{.underline}. [Icebreakers are crucial for safety of
life and constabulary missions in the poles,]{.underline} but their
usefulness in naval warfare has historically been limited.
[If]{.underline}, however, [new icebreakers were designed to deploy and
service uncrewed systems, their mission set would greatly expand,
bolstering a credible Arctic defense posture.]{.underline}

[Heavy icebreakers are effective in areas with dangerous seasonal ice
and hard multiyear ice. In the High North, they can break ice for
convoys of resupply and merchant vessels through the Northwest Passage
and Northern Sea Route, conduct rescue and salvage operations and
provide presence for scientific and strategic purposes.]{.underline}
Overlapping claims to the Arctic Ocean seabed around the North Pole by
Russia, Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark may also encourage patrolling
with icebreakers equipped for coast guard purposes.

To do so, [icebreakers are fitted with powerful engines, sloping bows
and reinforced hulls and propellers, enabling them to break and push
ice.]{.underline} These features set them apart from other ships, but
they also make icebreakers relatively slow, noisy and high in energy
consumption. Additionally, construction of each vessel is expensive (up
to \$3 billion) and time-consuming, lasting 7-10 years.

[Given their high procurement and operational costs, and crewing
limitations, nations will face constraints on the number of icebreakers
they can field.]{.underline} Additionally, [some missions]{.underline},
such as anti-submarine warfare, [require capabilities like sonar domes
or arrays that are not well-suited to traditional icebreaker designs.
But next-generation icebreakers could enable new approaches to these
missions.]{.underline}

For example, to detect and track Russian submarines transiting from the
Barents Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, NATO forces today use a mix of
capabilities, such as satellites, seabed sensors, surface ships with
towed arrays, maritime patrol aircraft and submarines. However, there
are [[two primary limitations with the current
approach]{.underline}](https://www.hudson.org/national-security-defense/sustaining-the-undersea-advantage-transforming-anti-submarine-warfare-using-autonomous-systems).
First, it does not scale well. It requires numerous crewed assets to
cover Russian submarines, and if many Russian submarines simultaneously
surge through the Greenland-Iceland-U.K. (GIUK) gap or other regions,
there may not be enough forces to track and trail them. Second, Russian
submarines can avoid many allied surface ships and aircraft by operating
near and under the ice near Alaska, Canada and Greenland.

New icebreaker designs equipped with uncrewed assets can help solve
these two problems. Fitted with helipads, cranes, moonpools and storage
space, they can launch, recover and maintain airborne, surface and
undersea uncrewed sensors and vehicles. Numerous uncrewed assets can
help cover more area (in support of both civil and defense missions) and
generate other effects, such as deploying sensors, laying mines, or, in
the future, directly attacking submarines. To keep uncrewed assets
operational, mothership icebreakers can refuel and maintain them ---
even in marginal ice zones, thus contesting Russian submarines under the
ice. Additionally, by adopting large payload bays and interfaces,
icebreakers can not only better support traditional missions such as
navigation support, search and rescue and salvage today, but also be
future-proofed to easily integrate with a range of uncrewed systems as
they evolve to flexibly enable new warfighting concepts of operation.

Icebreakers cannot do it all. Allied forces will still need to field
other assets across domains to efficiently operate, and if necessary,
fight effectively in the polar regions. Accordingly, NATO states are
wisely adding undersea sensors, uncrewed aircraft such as MQ-9B and
crewed aircraft such as P-8A, ice-hardened frigates and polar satellites
to their planned portfolios.

Bu[t **icebreakers remain the lynchpin of Arctic presence**. As allied
countries consider new programs, they should look beyond safety of life
and constabulary missions to maximize the value of icebreakers by
adopting designs that also support broader defense demands.]{.underline}
This week's NATO summit is the perfect time to break the ice on adopting
designs that leverage uncrewed systems from the start.

 

### Solvency -- deterrence/great power competition 

#### Icebreakers key protection of US ships in the arctic region and increasing missile range, only way to deter Russia's rapid advancing icebreaking capabilities

**Naval News,** writer for Army Recognition, **25**

\[Navy,"US Seeks to Accelerate Construction of New Arctic Icebreakers",

[Russia is also advancing its next-generation Leader
program]{.underline}, intended to surpass the current Arktika-class
vessels. [These future ships]{.underline}, measuring 209 meters in
length and 48 meters in width with a displacement of nearly 70,000 tons,
will be [powered by two next-generation nuclear reactors]{.underline}
with a combined output of 160,000 horsepower. This will [enable them to
cut through four meters of ice across their full beam]{.underline}. The
program aims to ensure year-round access for large commercial vessels on
the Northern Sea Route. However, the unit cost has doubled, now
exceeding \$3.5 billion per ship, and the first delivery has been
postponed to 2030. The two additional planned vessels may never be
completed due to budget constraints.

[Icebreakers, traditionally designed for civilian, scientific, or
logistical missions, are increasingly being adapted for strategic and
potentially military roles]{.underline} (Picture source: Rosatom)

Ezoic

China, meanwhile, is pursuing a more discreet but steady strategy. It
currently operates three icebreakers, including the Xue Long 2, which
entered service in 2019. Beijing is considering the construction of more
powerful vessels, including a nuclear-powered icebreaker currently under
review---a move that would mark a significant shift in its technological
capabilities. On October 7, 2024, China conducted a coordinated Arctic
mission with all three of its icebreakers, demonstrating its intention
to strengthen its presence in a region that has historically been
peripheral to its strategic concerns. This initiative aligns with
Beijing's broader narrative of positioning itself as a "near-Arctic
state" and securing long-term access to Arctic resources and sea routes.

[These developments raise growing security concerns]{.underline}.
[Icebreakers, traditionally designed for civilian, scientific, or
logistical missions,]{.underline} are increasingly being adapted for
strategic and potentially military roles[. Russia has already integrated
military systems into some of its icebreaker]{.underline}s, including
sensors, tactical communication suites, and even the potential for armed
modules. [Some analysts have suggested that short-range missile systems
could be deployed on these vessels under the justification of convoy
protection in contested areas.]{.underline}

While the [United States maintains a more restrained doctrine, it has
not ruled out equipping future Arctic Security Cutters with modular
weapon system]{.underline}s. Although no armaments are explicitly
mentioned in current technical specifications, the presence of a hangar
and flight deck enables the deployment of drones and other airborne
platforms. These assets could eventually be used for aerial
surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, or the [protection of strategic
infrastructure in the Arctic region.]{.underline}

[Beyond their potential military applications, icebreakers have become
tools of national sovereignt]{.underline}y. As analyst Alexandre Taïthe
notes, \"they are the [clearest indicators of a state\'s interest in the
Arctic.\"]{.underline} These v[essels enable scientific research, secure
access to mineral and energy resources, assert symbolic presence, and
maintain a foothold in increasingly contested maritime
zones]{.underline}. As the retreat of sea ice opens new shipping routes
between Europe and Asia, the absence of a credible icebreaker fleet
increasingly equates to a loss of influence for states seeking to
maintain strategic access to these areas.

The U.S. Coast Guard's international solicitation could mark a pivotal
shift. For the first time, the United States is openly considering
foreign shipyards such as Davie in Canada or Helsinki Shipyard in
Finland to accelerate the modernization of its polar fleet. This
reflects a pressing strategic reality: to prevent Russia and China from
gaining uncontested control over Arctic maritime corridors and the
resources they border. In this context, the [Arctic Security Cutter
represents far more than a service vessel---it is a direct response to a
broader geopolitical realignment at the edge of the world.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- commercial icebreakers 

#### icebreakers are needed for deterrence and US arctic leadership

7/2/25 GDI- JH\] 

Meanwhile, [Russia continues to expand its icebreaker fleet to reinforce
its regional dominance.]{.underline} Through its Project 22220
initiative, [Russia is developing at least six nuclear-powered
icebreakers: three already built, a fourth under construction, and two
more in development. Decades of sustained investment have given Russia a
commanding presence in the Arctic---one that the U.S. is currently
unprepared to counter.]{.underline}

Delays and rising costs have beset efforts to modernize its Arctic
icebreaker fleet. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program won't deliver
its first icebreaker ready until 2029. Unresolved design issues and
rising material and labor costs have increased the price of the first
three ships by 39 percent. As a result, the Coast Guard must spend \$15
million per year to repair the aging Polar Star, which first entered
service in 1976. The U.S. Coast Guard assessed that America needs at
least eight icebreakers -- four heavy and four medium ships -- for its
future polar missions. [Without a shift in Arctic policy, the U.S. and
its allies may struggle to counter Russia's increasing
influence.]{.underline}

Such a shift will require collaboration. Currently, the U.S. ranks 19th
in global shipbuilding. Increased coordination with allies is essential
to reduce costs, accelerate production, and innovate. In July 2024, the
U.S., Canada, and Finland launched the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
(ICE Pact) to pool resources and enhance polar capabilities[. While the
ICE Pact is a key step in strengthening the West\'s Arctic strategy,
further cooperation with NATO allies is needed, especially as a Pentagon
report from July 2024 warned of growing Arctic ties between Russia and
China.]{.underline}

[Long-term icebreaker needs cannot be met without greater shipbuilding
cooperation with allies]{.underline}. Two existing laws prevent the
Coast Guard from building vessels or major components in foreign
shipbuilding ports. The President can authorize an exception if it is in
the national security interest -- and this clearly is. Both Canada and
Finland are close NATO allies with a shared interest in countering
Russian power in the Arctic. [If the President is serious about closing
the force projection gap, exemptions to allow shipbuilding collaboration
with our allies will be necessary.]{.underline}

In addition to icebreaker production, increased military cooperation
with allies is crucial for effective deterrence. Access to Alaska's
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base has enabled
the U.S. and its allies to conduct joint military exercises, such as the
Arctic Defender exercise in July 2024, which involved approximately 500
personnel from the U.S., Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France.
Expanding exercises like Arctic Defender -- particularly among other
Arctic nations -- would further bolster interoperability, improve
operational readiness, and communicate collective resolve to deter
adversaries.

[The Coast Guard should also collaborate with commercial companies to
expedite the design and construction of additional
icebreakers.]{.underline} The U.S. Government Accountability Office
found that delays in the Polar Security Cutter program were caused by
beginning construction before the design was completed. Partnering with
the private sector could streamline the process and accelerate
production. [While the U.S. ordered its first commercial icebreaker last
month, more are needed to close the icebreaker gap. Alaska's
congressional delegation secured \$125 million in funding for this
purchase, but broader congressional support is essential to meet the
full scope of Arctic security needs.]{.underline}

Polar ice may diminish, but tension over the Arctic will only increase
as its strategic value grows. On September 10, 2024, Russia and China
began a massive week-long \"Ocean-24\" joint naval exercise covering the
Arctic Ocean, indicating that their growing alignment may extend to
Arctic interests. Similarly, Russian military aircraft have been more
frequently spotted in Alaska's Air Defense Identification Zone,
including three times in the last week[. If the U.S. fails to make
necessary adjustments, it risks losing its foothold in the Arctic and
falling further behind Russia and China's increasing military presence.
A reinvigorated icebreaker procurement program and partnerships with
allies are indispensable to closing the polar icebreaker gap to deter
American adversaries before it\'s too late.]{.underline}

[It\'s true that ice is melting in the Arctic, but this doesn\'t mean
the U.S. no longer needs icebreaker ships to operate in the region. And
right now, the **U.S. needs more than what it currently has**.  The Navy
doesn\'t operate icebreakers, but the  Coast Guard does. According to
its website, the Coast Guard currently has only two operational
icebreakers in its fleet. ** \"Strategically, icebreakers provide
persistent presence in a way that\'s not met by anything else in the
maritime region,\"** Randy **Kee, who serves as the senior advisor for
arctic security affairs** with the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic
Security Studies, **said.** \"Remember, the Arctic is a maritime region,
and **icebreaking provides you year-round access to be able to go in the
region.\"**  With ice melting in the Arctic --- but not entirely gone
--- routes of passage for shipping are opening up there in ways that
have not existed before. Additionally, there are ample opportunities for
commercial fishing and the mining of minerals. By **some estimates**,
there is as much as **90 billion barrels of oil yet untapped in the
Arctic.**   U.S. access to the region will require that all nations
operating in the Arctic play by internationally established rules. But
unless the U.S. can operate freely there --- which will surely require
the use of icebreakers --- it may not be able to participate in the
opportunities opening up or protect its interests.  \"**You need
icebreaking to be able to project year-round presence and when it\'s
\[of\] your time and choosing**,\" Kee said during a virtual panel
discussion today with the Atlantic Council.  Currently, six new polar
icebreakers capable of operating in the Arctic are authorized for
bolstering the Coast Guard\'s icebreaking fleet, Kee said, adding that
the Coast Guard has said they need all six of them. According to a Coast
Guard spokesperson, there are no plans right now retire to either of the
Coast Guard\'s existing icebreakers.  Kee also addressed concerns about
the Russian Federation\'s own \"vast number of icebreakers.\"  He said
that while the Russians do use some of those **icebreakers** to maintain
a sovereign presence in the Arctic, others **are necessary for running
logistics operations in the region, where Russian communities dot the
coast of the Arctic** Ocean.  \"They also use \[them\] for logistics
support to their northern communities, because they don\'t have any
other way to get the products to those communities,\" he
said.  ]{.underline}

strategic and economic interests in the Arctic region. These ships are
the most efficient and effective tool for conducting research and

[[more

into the Polar Security Cutter program that outlines a plan to construct
six new icebreakers, with the first scheduled to begin sea trials by
2024. Three of these ships---heavy polar icebreakers---have the capacity
to cut through ice that is at least 10-feet thick. The other
three---medium icebreakers---can crack through about 8 feet of ice. The
icebreakers currently operated by the Coast Guard, known as Polar
Security Cutters, do all the same things other Coast Guard cutters do,
including search and rescue, law enforcement, and national security
missions. Spanning at least 65 feet in length, crews can live on these
cutters that patrol areas like the Caribbean where migrant and drug
trafficking issues are prevalent[.]{.underline} Unlike regular cutters,
Polar Security Cutters can also break through thick ice[. This means
they can operate in areas that would otherwise not have a U.S. presence,
aside from aircraft and submarines.]{.underline} The Biden

requests \$170 million for the Polar Security Cutter program to
construct the first two cutters and requests long-lead materials for the
third. [Long-lead materials are components that take the longest to
obtain for a ship's construction.]{.underline} The Biden
administration's budget request prioritizes Polar Security Cutters. This
budget allocates \$1 billion toward investing in vessels, with about 17%
funding Polar Security Cutters alone[. In the meantime, the Coast Guard
must operate its current assets, which is why [\$15
million](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/06/02/coast-guard-gets-pay-raise-bidens-first-budget-request.html)
of this budget will go toward sustaining the aged Polar Star. The sooner
the Coast Guard commissions new ships, the sooner it can halt funding
for repairing aging cutters. Even after the initial acquisition of the
three heavy icebreakers, the Coast Guard really needs all six to meet
the growing demands from China and Russia in the Arctic region.
Supplying the Coast Guard with a larger icebreaking fleet will allow it
to fulfill its mission motto---"semper paratus," Latin for "always
ready"---and confront any challenge that comes its way.]{.underline}

[The core challenge for North America lies in acquiring the knowledge to
scale up icebreaker production and build a sustainable domestic
industry.]{.underline} Beyond simply meeting today's vessel demand, both
countries aim to foster long-term industrial resilience. Finland, a
global leader in icebreaking technology, constructs over half of the
world's ice-capable vessels. Its deep expertise represents a strategic
opportunity for broader collaboration.

The United States and Canada have made no secret of their intention to
expand their icebreaking fleets, with plans to build the new tonnage
domestically. [The U.S. has signaled it could need up to 40 new
icebreaking vessels]{.underline}, in addition to ice-class support ships
for high-north operations. [Canada is likewise seeking to replace and
expand its fleet, with demand projected to exceed 20 new ice-capable
vessels.]{.underline} 

[For both countries, the need is commercial as well as strategic. The
gradual opening of the Northwest Passage is expected to boost merchant
shipping in the coming decades, though navigation will continue to
require icebreaking assistance. Strategically, all Arctic nations --
regardless of current geopolitical tensions -- recognize the polar
region's growing importance for defense and economic
development. ]{.underline}

[While the U.S. and Canada possess domestic shipyard capacity, they must
rely on international partners for specialized technical
expertise]{.underline} -- chiefly from Finland. [The existing Icebreaker
Collaboration Effort (ICE) agreement between the three countries shows a
willingness to cooperate, but currently amounts to little more than a
memorandum of understanding. It lacks the clear commitments needed to
design and build the ships in question.]{.underline}

It's the U.S. Coast Guard's job to patrol these waters as part of an

average, it can still form and move about the ocean unpredictably. A

## China Scenario 

### No Taiwan invasion or escalation 

#### No Escalation--- Chinese invasion of Taiwan will not threaten U.S. interests. 

**Swaine, Senior Fellow specializing in Chinese defense and foreign
policy \-- Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2025**

Michael, "Taiwan: Defending a Non-Vital US Interest", The Washington
Quarterly, Spring 2025,
[[https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2025.2478779]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2025.2478779)
, accessed 07/01/2025 HDCSW- LA

Beyond all this, an arguably growing number of proponents of the "vital
interest" argument believe that the United States needs to jettison its
long-standing stance of strategic ambiguity regarding whether and how
Washington might intervene militarily to defend Taiwan if attacked by
China. In its place, they argue for providing what amounts to an
unambiguous US security guarantee to Taipei, similar to that provided to
US treaty allies.

[There is no doubt that Taiwan has considerable value to the United
States. It is indeed a long-standing democratic friend with close ties
to many American citizens and political leaders]{.underline}, the author
included. [It is a significant economic and technology player on the
world stage.]{.underline} And it stands as an example of a successfully
democratized Han Chinese society, thus presumably serving as an
inspiration to pro-democracy citizens in the PRC. But [although these
factors argue in favor of strong US support for Taiwan's continued
freedom and well-being---as an "important" US interest---they do not
inherently argue for unlimited US support for the island as a "vital" US
interest to the extent of risking a major war with China]{.underline}

Moreover, [in response to China gaining control over Taiwan, it is
almost certain that Washington's defense ties with Japan, South Korea,
and probably the Philippines would become tighter and more
potent]{.underline}. As a result, Washington and its allies would likely
possess the combined air, naval, intelligence, and spacebased
capabilities to strategically counter any military advantages Beijing
might gain from acquiring the island, should the Chinese leadership be
foolish enough to attempt to use Taiwan in a larger effort to attack or
coerce its neighbors. (In fact, experts have observed that Japan-US
combined forces are currently sufficient to deter Chinese aggression
against Japan.)12 Indeed, [regardless of whether Beijing were to control
Taiwan, some observers believe that any attempt by China to subdue the
entire region would prove extremely difficult,]{.underline} especially
considering the inherent geographical advantages Japan and the
Philippines hold along the first island chain. 

[Also, one must ask: What is the credible evidence supporting the
notion, put forth by some advocates of the "vital interest" argument,
that China would actually use Taiwan as a launching pad for
attacking]{.underline} or even decisively coercing Japan or other nearby
Asian nations into submission? Virtually without exception, [those who
argue for Beijing's apparently unquenchable thirst for the military
conquest or subordination of others employ a simplistic "power
maximizing" realpolitik or ideological set of assumptions about Chinese
motives. Some see Beijing as so insecure or belligerently aggressive due
to its supposedly ruthless, suspicious, and predatory Leninist political
system that it would inevitably seek to subjugate other
nations]{.underline}.14 [Others simply assert, as if a uniformly
accepted maxim, that China, like any other great power, would naturally
seek to dominate its neighbors through military and economic coercion or
attack due to a need to protect against the mere possibility that others
might attack]{.underline} it.

[Such views are largely divorced from any understanding of Beijing's
attitude toward the use of force or its historical experience in
employing its military]{.underline}. That [record shows that in the vast
majority of cases occurring since 1979, China has employed military
force only to address **specific** territorial disputes along its
borders or to **protect itself** against what it viewed as a **direct
military threat** to its established territory, **not** to subjugate
other powers for presumably grand geostrategic or ideological
reasons]{.underline}.

[Although China continues to state a preference for unifying with Taiwan
through peaceful methods, it has never renounced using
force]{.underline}. Indeed, for the past two decades its military
modernization has focused on developing capabilities that would enable
it to forcefully conquer Taiwan, ranging from ballistic missiles to
advanced fighter jets and the world's largest navy. China's military,
the People's Liberation Army, has increased the scale and sophistication
of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years, honing its combat
capabilities. As the prospect of gaining control of Taiwan peacefully
becomes more remote, with Taiwanese identity rising and Taiwanese
interest in unifying with the People's Republic of China (PRC)
declining, [China could conclude that using force is the only way to
achieve its political objectives. ]{.underline}

[Like Ukraine, Taiwan is a young democracy bordering a much stronger
authoritarian power that does not believe it should exist as an
independent state.]{.underline} After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many
Taiwanese people have concluded that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan needs
to be taken seriously.

[China is investing]{.underline} huge sums [to develop the capability to
bring Taiwan under its contro]{.underline}l by force, if need be. [At
the same time, invading Taiwan or mounting a successful blockade would
be the most complex military operation in modern history, and China's
military has not fought a major war in more than seven
decades.]{.underline}

[China would need to shift military assets to its eastern coast and
undertake other visible preparations for an invasion, which Taiwan and
the United States would likely be able to detect.]{.underline}

Some [questions remains about whether China has the naval vessels it
would need to invade Taiwan successfully. China's]{.underline}
amphibious [fleet is relatively small,]{.underline} and although
[Beijing will likely turn to civilian ships to sustain]{.underline} and
supplement [an invading force,]{.underline} [those take longer to unload
and would be more vulnerable to Taiwanese missiles.]{.underline}

A third-party [ABS analysis concluded that the USCG requires six,
domestically-produced icebreakers]{.underline} called Polar Security
Cutters, three of which are classified as heavy and three of which are
classified as medium. [Because the full-length analysis is classified,
non-cleared members of the public cannot access this
document.]{.underline} [An additional problem]{.underline} with applying
this document to the focus of this paper [is that ABS' quantity analysis
is performed for USCG icebreaking needs globally, rather than
exclusively in the Alaskan Arctic.]{.underline} Thus, this paper will
perform its own abbreviated analysis with a more focused and appropriate
scope. 

[Several factors must be considered to answer the quantity question. The
question of how many icebreakers the U.S. needs is highly dependent on
its goals in the Arctic]{.underline}, as nearly everyone interviewed for
this project has explained[. How the U.S. is attempting to position
itself in the Arctic influences the number and the specifications of
icebreakers needed.]{.underline} Put simply, "[the challenge with how
many icebreakers is enough icebreakers is how you intend to use
them]{.underline}," according to Kelsey Frazier of the Alaska-based
Arctic Domain Awareness Center. 

U.S. posturing in the Arctic is a matter of debate. One Arctic
researcher in the Washington area argues that [the U.S. should not seek
to dominate the Arctic but]{.underline}, in its current state, s[hould
seek to acquire minimum capabilities to access and operate within the
region without excessively militarizing it. Russia has already invested
heavily in Arctic infrastructure and currently is the dominant power in
the region.]{.underline} To achieve this posturing, this interviewee
argues the U.S. still must expand its icebreaker fleet, but not to the
degree needed to dominate the region. This interviewee argues [the U.S.
should acquire a mixture of military and civilian icebreakers, a mixture
that would maintain icebreakers as a non-militarized
platform. ]{.underline}

Despite support for this idea, [there are several problems with this
proposal]{.underline}. First, legality. Under 10 U.S.C. 7309 and 7310,
[contracts to build ships]{.underline} "[for any of the armed
forces]{.underline}" or "a major component of the hull or superstructure
of a vessel for any of the armed forces" [cannot be awarded to foreign
shipyards.]{.underline} However, there are ways to circumvent this
restriction. Icebreakers that were already constructed under non-U.S.
contracts could theoretically be purchased by the U.S. for use by the
USCG. However, this could present additional pitfalls. 

The Jones Act, part of the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, "requires
merchandise being transported by water between U.S. points, even by way
of foreign ports, to be shipped aboard vessels that are 1) U.S.-built 2)
U.S.-citizen owned and 3) registered in the U.S."76 [In the event a USCG
icebreaker was needed to perform a rescue mission to provide a remote,
Arctic Alaskan community with a needed good, the USCG could encounter
legality problems transporting that good to those
communities]{.underline} due to the Jones Act. There are, however,
waivers that could be acquired to exempt foreign-built icebreakers from
the Jones Act. The Jones Act can be waived under 46 U.S.C. § 501 (a) for
entities under the command of the Secretary of Defense if such a waiver
is "necessary in the interest of national defense." These requests are
submitted to the Secretary of Defense and forwarded for approval to the
Secretary of Homeland Security. It would need to be ensured that such a
waiver would be approved before the purchase of a foreign icebreaker
could proceed. 

[A substantial obstacle to this solution is a general lack of interest
within the USCG.]{.underline} In interviews with multiple USCG sources,
they expressed that **[the USCG was more interested in waiting for a
platform built to their exact specifications rather than acquiring a
platform that is only partially useful immediately]{.underline}**. One
defense acquisition expert argues that **[the process of icebreaker
acquisitions is a long term game and therefore it is worth waiting for a
better product]{.underline}**. Admiral Zukunft has argued that [leasing
an icebreaker would not]{.underline} "[provide us an optimal return on
investment for a platform that quite honestly we've proven that we can
maintain these for 35 or 40-plus years.]{.underline}" Michael Emerson of
the USCG described the new class of icebreakers currently in production
as "warships." If these PSC are indeed intended to be combat-capable,
foreign acquisitions would likely be less useful than domestically
produced icebreakers. 

There are also political reasons why the U.S. does not acquire
icebreakers from foreign actors. [Icebreakers are expensive, and
Congress is less likely to allocate money for their acquisition if the
process does not create American jobs and/or contribute to the American
economy]{.underline}, according to one Arctic researcher in the
Washington area.

Long Term Domestic Production of Icebreakers

There are several downsides to acquiring icebreakers from allies. First,
there is the national security aspect of domestic production capability.
[In the event of a conflict, having the capacity to domestically produce
icebreakers would reduce the U.S.' reliance on foreign entities,
increasing the reliability with which the U.S. could procure an
icebreaker. Dependency on foreign entities for equipment needed to meet
the missions required of national security institutions is
undesirable.]{.underline}

Second, appearances matter. [If the U.S. intends to lead in the Arctic,
having the ability to produce its own icebreakers could be a signal of
intent, responsibility, and capability. China, a non-Arctic state, has
domestically produced two icebreakers. If the U.S. intends to assert
itself as an Arctic state in the international arena, having the
domestic capability to produce icebreakers would be a much-needed signal
of intent, commitment, and responsibility.]{.underline}

## Shipbuilding 

### No solvency shipbuilding 

#### Shipbuilding industry on the brink -- steel tariffs alt causes  

**Hutchens,** writer Defense Security Monitor **2025 **

**[Since the reimposition of 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum
by President Donald Trump in]{.underline}  [early 2025, the U.S.
shipbuilding industry has found itself at a critical
juncture.]{.underline}** Originally introduced  during Donald Trump's
presidency in 2018 and reinstated during his second term, the 25% tariff
on steel  aims to protect American manufacturing and reduce reliance on
foreign materials[. **While the**]{.underline} ** [administration touts
these tariffs as a means to bolster domestic manufacturing and national
security,]{.underline}  [the tariffs will undoubtedly create ripple
effects for the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Steel: The]{.underline}
 [Backbone of Shipbuilding Steel is the foundational material in nearly
every component of a modern]{.underline}  [ship, from the hull and
superstructure to internal support systems.]{.underline}** American
shipbuilders rely on a  steady supply of high-grade steel to build
critical naval vessels like destroyers, aircraft carriers, and 
submarines. While the U.S. does produce significant amounts of steel
domestically, specialty alloys and  certain grades still come from
global partners, including allies like Canada, the United Kingdom, and
the  European Union. Rising Costs and Shifting Supply Chains While
**[the tariffs]{.underline}** incentivize domestic  production, they
also **[increase the cost of imported steel, which would raise overall
material costs for]{.underline}  [shipbuilders unless they adjust their
supply chains. Shipbuilders may also face difficulties in
sourcing]{.underline}  [sufficient quantities of steel
domestically.]{.underline}** Overall**[, the escalation in expenses
could strain the Navy's]{.underline}  [budget, and shifting supply
chains could potentially slow shipbuilding and maintenance
schedules,]{.underline}  [which are already substantially
delayed.]{.underline}** As a result, manufacturers are bracing for the
impact of the  tariffs, which could drive up operational and supply
costs for those relying on steel inputs. **[As prices rise,]{.underline}
 [shipyards are faced with tough decisions: delay projects, absorb
costs, pass them on to buyers, or]{.underline}  [reduce their
workforce.]{.underline}** The latter option would be unlikely but
particularly problematic given the  already-strained [demand for skilled
labor]{.underline} in the shipbuilding industry. Implications for Fleet
Expansion The steel tariffs also come at a time when the Navy plans to
expand its fleet in order to counter growing  maritime threats,
especially in the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S. Navy's shipbuilding
targets have  fluctuated, but the current goal is a fleet of [381 battle
force ships]{.underline} (i.e., the number of commissioned  ships or
other ships that contribute directly to Navy warfighting or support
missions). However, despite  nearly [doubling its shipbuilding
budget]{.underline} over the last two decades, the Navy has not
increased its number  of battle force ships. For decades, private
industry has struggled to meet the Navy's goals for increasing  the size
of its fleet. This has contributed to the Navy's shipbuilding programs
being consistently over  budget and behind schedule. Estimated delays
for some ships, including the [Constellation-class frigate]{.underline}
 [program]{.underline}, are as much as three years. Moreover, the Navy's
Virginia-class submarine program is already  projected to cost [\$17
billion over its initial budget]{.underline} by 2030**[. Higher steel
prices would likely increase]{.underline}  [already elevated
shipbuilding costs and exacerbate existing difficulties]{.underline}**
in meeting the 381-ship goal. Implications for AUKUS The AUKUS pact
between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States  could also
be affected. The pact, aimed at enhancing security in the Indo-Pacific
region, involves the U.S.  supplying nuclear-powered submarines to
Australia. However, the tariffs threaten to derail this initiative  by
increasing production costs and straining relationships with key allies.
Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a  member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, highlighted that [35% of the materials]{.underline} used in
U.S.  shipbuilding come from allies such as the UK, Canada, and European
nations. Senator Kaine also warned  that these tariffs could undermine
the AUKUS partnership by increasing submarine production costs and 
delaying delivery of nuclear-powered submarines promised to Australia as
part of the pact. This could  ultimately strain the trilateral
relationship and complicate a key U.S. foreign policy objective aimed
at  countering China's growing naval presence in the Indo-Pacific.
Conclusion **[The reimposition of steel]{.underline}  [tariffs in 2025
has brought renewed attention to the shifting balance between enhancing
domestic steel production and raising costs for shipyards, both of which
carry implications for international defense
collaborations.]{.underline}** While the long-term impacts remain to be
seen, stakeholders across  government and industry continue to evaluate
how best to align trade policy with broader goals,  including job
creation, industrial competitiveness, and national security concerns.
Ongoing discussions  around targeted exemptions, supply chain
flexibility, and allied cooperation may shape how the  shipbuilding
sector adapts moving forward. The relationship between steel tariffs and
shipbuilding  capacity will most certainly remain a topic of active
policy debate and industry focus.

## Russia

### Russia DA Link -- loss of leadership

#### Uniqueness -- loss of leadership in Artic increases risk of retaliation by Russia, turns case 

**Globle**, senior research associate at Eurocollege, **24**

\[Paul, "Russia Facing Loss Of Icebreaker Dominance In Arctic --
Analysis",Eurasia Review,7/27/24,Jesuit Nexis, HDCSW-JCP KGrid 7/1/25\]

[Moscow has long counted on its large fleet of
icebreakers]{.underline}---containing 41 ships, seven of which are
nuclear---to [ensure its control not only of the Northern Sea Route but
also of access to the natural resources]{.underline} in and under the
Arctic Sea (Russian Transportation Ministry, February 20).

The Kremlin apparently sees this as a reasonable assumption given the
role of such ships in that ice-bound ocean and the much smaller
icebreaker fleets other countries have fielded, as no other country has
more than a handful of icebreakers (Rosbalt, July 15). [However, three
developments now call this dominance into question:]{.underline}

[Global warming has left more, but far from all, of the Arctic ice-free.
This has allowed more ships to transit]{.underline} without icebreaker
support and even creates the [possibility of opening alternative routes
and reducing the importance of Russia\'s current advantage]{.underline}
(seeEDM, October 3, 2017;The Barents Observer, July 12).

[Outside powers have become increasingly active in the Arctic. China,
which now defines itself as \"a near Arctic\" country, has been rapidly
expanding its icebreaker fleet]{.underline}. Earlier this month, the
United States, Canada, and Finland committed themselves to building as
many as 90 icebreakers by 2030 (The White House;CTV News;Reuters, July
11;The Barent Observer, July 12).

[Problems in Russia\'s shipyards and its inability to make use of those
in other countries due to sanctions means that Moscow has little hope of
countering these challeng]{.underline}es and thus will likely lose its
advantages in the north (Window on Eurasia,November 18, 2022,April 4).

As a result, despite continuing Russian claims that Western and even
Chinese efforts to catch and surpass Moscow\'s icebreaker fleet in the
Arctic will not succeed, the Kremlin can clearly see the writing on the
wall (Portnews.ru, March 8). [Moscow may very well decide to take action
in the Arctic before it loses its current advantages over both China and
the West]{.underline}---a decision that would make an expanded conflict
there more likely in the short term (seeEDM, March 30).

By any objective standard, **[U.S.]{.underline}**/NATO
**[military]{.underline}** deployments **[in the Arctic do not currently
represent a threat to Russia]{.underline}**'s Northern Fleet or to its
other military assets there. The region possesses an abundance of
natural resources, especially oil and gas, but these are available
elsewhere in Russia. Exploring and extracting them in the Arctic
requires huge capital investments and modern technology that would
stretch its capacity. Global warming is opening up new commercial
opportunities for shipping and fishing, but there is scant
infrastructure in the region to capitalize on these opportunities, and
rectifying this deficiency will be costly.

**[Russia's evolving Arctic ambitions have engendered growing concerns
among other Arctic nations, yet surprisingly little is known about the
basis for these ambitions.]{.underline}** This paper therefore addresses
the following questions: What are the drivers of Russia's Arctic policy?
How does it define its interests in the region and what tools does it
employ to advance them? Who are the Russian stakeholders that would
benefit from the exploitation of the region? What are the prospects for
Russia realizing its ambitions? What are the implications of its actions
and ambitions for U.S./NATO interests and policy?

For Russia, Arctic Strategy Is Integral to European Strategy

Since Vladimir Putin first became president, the Arctic has evolved into
an increasingly important arena of Russian foreign, military, and
economic policy. The Kremlin's interest in the region became apparent
soon after Russia emerged from its time of troubles in the 1990s and
gradually resumed an active posture on the world stage in the early
2000s.

Long History, Multiple Drivers

Russian involvement in the Arctic dates back several hundred years. Much
of this historical activity was supported and encouraged by successive
governments and aimed at promoting trade and extracting natural
resources. The discovery of oil and gas in Siberia---below and above the
Arctic Circle---in the twentieth century offered wealth and hard
currency, enabled domestic consumption, funded the Soviet military
machine, and provided the economic foundation for the Soviet Union to
pursue its foreign policy objectives.

The exploitation of Arctic riches accelerated in post-Soviet Russia. Oil
and gas played the pivotal role in restoring the country's economic
fortunes in the early 2000s, underwriting domestic stability, fostering
Putin's rise as the country's undisputed leader, and returning Russia to
the world stage as an aspiring great power intent upon recouping its
losses in Europe and reclaiming its rightful place in the international
system.

The role of oil and gas in Russia's Arctic ambitions was highlighted in
2006 as part of the Kremlin's agenda to establish the country as an
"energy superpower" and to justify its inclusion in the G8.^3^ Rising
temperatures would make those riches more accessible and ensure the
Kremlin a steady source of revenues as well as market and geopolitical
influence in Europe and Asia. And without any contenders to challenge
these ambitions, Russia had a shot at securing its place as a major
geopolitical presence in the Arctic.

Even the high projected costs and technological difficulties associated
with exploration and recovery of Arctic offshore resources did not
appear to pose a major obstacle to the Kremlin's ambitions. Projects
would be open to participation by foreign energy companies with their
technology and capital, and their participation would make them powerful
stakeholders that could influence Western governments' policy choices
toward Russia. Moreover, thanks to the warming temperatures in the
Arctic, the development of the NSR along Russia's Arctic coastline would
provide the Kremlin with an opportunity to diversify its energy policy
by eventually linking the Russian Arctic to markets in Asia, thus
reducing the country's reliance on Europe as a critical energy market
and on Ukraine as a critical conduit to that market.^4^

With oil and gas accounting for as much as 60 percent of Russia's export
revenues and upward of 30 percent of its federal budget, the motive
behind its Arctic ambitions is not difficult to discern. The revenue
from these projects would help sustain several critical priorities:
further consolidation of Putin's hold on political power as the leader
who returned Russia from the abyss and restored it to greatness, the
accumulation of funds to hedge against future economic or political
adversity, and the rebuilding of the military, which had long suffered
from neglect and was in need of modernization.

Reversal of Fortunes in Europe

Europe has always been the most important strategic theater for Russia.
Its quest for security, great-power status, and recognition as an equal
by other European countries has long been reflected in its preoccupation
with strategic depth and a difficult relationship with major European
powers. Immediately following the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia
suffered major setbacks to these objectives and was relegated to the
margins of the continent's security, diplomacy, and geopolitics.^5^ The
eastward expansion of NATO dealt a major blow to Russia's historical
ambitions and objectives in Europe, and especially to its quest for
strategic depth as a measure of physical security of the homeland. NATO
claimed responsibility for European security, and from Moscow's
perspective, other major European powers---historic adversaries---would
have a voice and a veto at the NATO table while Russia would be left out
in the cold.

By the end of the 2000s, Russian officials raised with increasing
frequency concerns about the proximity of alliance forces to the Russian
heartland and continued NATO expansion, despite the fact that most of
NATO's military capabilities had been redirected toward non-Russian
threats. Moscow was particularly alarmed by the prospect of any future
membership in the alliance by Georgia and Ukraine---something that the
Kremlin saw as unacceptable and a threat to Russia.

However, it was **[Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014]{.underline}**
that **[led to a]{.underline}** fundamental shift **[in NATO's posture
and Russia's designation as the principal threat to the alliance's
security. These reactions by NATO to Russian aggression against Ukraine
in turn magnified Russian perceptions of threat from the
West]{.underline}**. More recently, the unrest in Belarus has added to
the Kremlin's growing perception of vulnerability, raising doubts about
Minsk's reliability as an ally in the event of a large-scale conflict
with NATO.^6^

Russia's investments in Arctic energy projects are part of its broader
strategy toward Europe and the wider world, but Europe is the most
important arena in the Kremlin's strategic calculations. The revenue
from these investments helps sustain Russia's defense capabilities
needed for balancing against NATO, while Arctic navigation and maritime
access to Asia will enable it to reduce its dependence on Europe, which
it sees as hostile and increasingly intent on constraining Russia
through a military buildup on its border and seemingly endless economic
sanctions.^7^

Russian Military and Economic Interests in the Arctic

Russia has three key military interests in the Arctic. Foremost is
securing the second-strike capability of its ballistic missile submarine
(SSBN) force on the Kola Peninsula---home to seven of the Russian Navy's
eleven ballistic missile submarines---in a conflict with NATO.^8^
Concerns about the security of these assets largely account for Russia's
efforts to improve its anti-access/area-denial systems and monitoring
and surveillance capabilities, the increasing tempo of strategic
exercises and patrols of long-range bombers and anti-submarine warfare
(ASW) aircraft, and the upgrading of military infrastructure to support
these operations.^9^

A second, partly related, interest is protecting Russia's ability to
operate in the North Atlantic and the European Arctic in the event of a
conflict with NATO. Unlike Russia's other fleets, the Northern Fleet has
direct access to the Barents and Norwegian Seas and the Atlantic Ocean.
Its ability to operate there could be critical in determining the
outcome of a conflict on NATO's eastern flank.^10^

A third interest is military protection for Russia's growing economic
development, investments, and commercial interests in the Arctic. The
vastness of the region, the long and open borders whose only protection
is offered by remoteness and inhospitable climate, the poor
communications systems and infrastructure, the overall harsh
environmental conditions, and growing civilian activities there increase
the risk of maritime shipping, nuclear, and environmental
accidents---and thus the need to be able to rapidly deploy
military-response capabilities.

Russia's peacetime military presence in the Arctic and the allocation of
resources to improve its military capabilities and infrastructure there
are aligned with these interests. Maintaining a predominant military
position in the Arctic is seen as a necessary component of Russia's
posture there, given the Kremlin's priorities in Europe and tense
relationship with the West, NATO's enhanced military capabilities near
the Russian border, and Western sanctions targeted to constrain Russian
energy exploration and production activities in the Arctic.

Economics and Energy

Russia's sparsely populated Arctic territories account for 10 percent of
the country's gross domestic product and roughly 20 percent of its
exports. Hydrocarbons comprise the major share, but these also include
nonferrous and precious metals, stones, and other raw materials.^11^
About one-third of all fish harvested in Russia comes from Arctic
waters, making it a key food source. The Russian government hopes to
increase that share by 2030, as warming ocean water pushes fish stocks
northward.^12^

Tapping these resources is Russia's primary economic interest, but doing
so will require developing costly and complicated road, rail, aviation,
and maritime transportation infrastructure to connect the Arctic to
other parts of the country and beyond. It will also require expanding
icebreaking capabilities and developing ports, weather stations, and
emergency response facilities. Building this infrastructure is Moscow's
second economic priority in the region.

Finally, Russia aspires to transform its northern coast into the
Northern Sea Route, a navigable maritime corridor through Arctic waters.
Currently passable without icebreaker escort only in the summer months,
the corridor is used mainly by Russian vessels to transport Arctic
resources to markets in Asia. Russia's 2020 Arctic strategy, however,
envisions transforming it into a competitive Asia-Europe maritime
corridor by 2035.^13^

Russia's Tools

**[Russia has pursued its ambitions in the Arctic with legal,
diplomatic, economic, military, and information tools that it has
wielded with considerable skill and persistence.]{.underline}**

The Law of the Sea

Russia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS), which the United States has never ratified. The Kremlin
has based its claim to a large portion of the Arctic seabed as its
exclusive economic zone under UNCLOS, arguing that the geology of its
continental shelf is consistent with the terms of the convention.^14^
After its initial claim was rejected on technical grounds by the UN in
2001, Moscow submitted another in 2015.^15^ Its claim conflicts with
similar ones submitted by Canada and Denmark, but if successful, it
would grant Russia exclusive rights to exploit offshore resources in a
vast portion of the Arctic Ocean. While it awaits the decision, Russia
is negotiating bilaterally with Canada and Denmark on ways to reconcile
their positions.

Regional Diplomacy

For regional diplomacy, Russia relies on the Arctic Council, which is
the main international forum dealing with matters of governance and
cooperation in the region.^16^ The council brings together the eight
Arctic member states, organizations representing the region's native
peoples, and several observer states and organizations, including China.
The Arctic Council's 1996 founding Ottawa Declaration limits its mandate
to issues of environmental protection, scientific research, and
sustainable development.^17^ Military and security matters were
purposely left out. Russia will take over the Arctic Council's two-year
chairmanship in May 2021 and has pledged to launch regional cooperation
initiatives to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, attract investment, and
improve the condition of Indigenous People.^18^ Always eager to be seen
as influential on the world stage, Russia will use its chairmanship to
promote its soft power image on Arctic issues, even if concrete
follow-through on environmental issues or Indigenous rights is lacking.

Russia also participates in the Arctic Five forum, which groups the
Arctic littoral states---Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United
States---and does not include other international or nongovernmental
actors.^19^ The Arctic Five meets on an ad hoc basis, often on the
sidelines of other international gatherings. The Arctic Five generally
serves as a discussion platform for maritime issues, including fisheries
management and competing claims to the continental shelf. As an informal
body, it is sufficiently flexible to deal with other issues as required.

Economics

**[Despite Russia's limited resources and anemic economy, the Kremlin
has committed nontrivial fiscal and monetary resources to support its
ambitious agenda in the Arctic. The Russian government has offered tax
incentives to large energy, mining, and infrastructure companies to
invest in the region]{.underline}**---especially in the eastern/Siberian
Arctic territories, which to date have seen far less development than
those Arctic regions west of the Urals.^20^

Some of these incentives are clearly intended for companies with close
Kremlin connections. For example, in 2019 the government announced \$41
billion in tax incentives over the next thirty years for Rosneft to
develop the Vostok oil field, with the goal of eventually producing 2
million barrels a day.^21^ Potential Indian and Chinese investors in the
project approached by Rosneft asked for similar incentives as a
precondition for their participation, but reportedly have yet to agree
terms.^22^

In 2020, the government approved an incentive program worth over \$300
billion for Arctic infrastructure, industrial, liquefied natural gas
(LNG), and oil and gas extraction projects.^23^ Other than oil and gas
extraction, the petrochemical, mining, and timber industries will
receive incentives to attract domestic and foreign investors.^24^ These
incentives are intended to stimulate economic activity and the
construction of towns, power plants, ports, and airports, as well as to
stem the outmigration of population from the region.^25^

Hard Power

**[The Northern Fleet is Russia's main military instrument in the
Arctic. It is used to secure the SSBN force and Arctic borders; to
assert great-power status; to support territorial and resource claims,
economic interests, and infrastructure; and to counter and deter the
buildup of military forces by NATO members and partners, and neutral
countries, that the Kremlin considers threatening to Russian interests
in the region.^26^]{.underline}**

The importance attached to the Northern Fleet is reflected in
organizational changes that have elevated its status. In 2014, Russia
created an Arctic joint strategic command for the primary purpose of
providing enhanced protection to existing and planned military
installations along the NSR. As a critical component of this
reorganization, a new Arctic brigade was created. In January, the
Northern Fleet was formally designated as Russia's fifth Military
District---the first time that a fleet has been given equal stature with
one of the land Military Districts.^27^

These important changes are the manifestation of the Kremlin's 2017
announcement that the capabilities of the Northern Fleet were being
upgraded to "phase NATO out of the Arctic."^28^ The fleet's capabilities
are being modernized with the introduction of more capable naval surface
combatants, missile and artillery units; four new brigade combat teams;
a motorized infantry brigade; and more sophisticated air defense
systems, anti-ship cruise missiles, and command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance systems.^29^ In addition, facilities are being
constructed or upgraded to provide increased logistical support for
these assets and a planned fleet of over fifty icebreakers.^30^

Based on the current pace and scope of this force modernization program,
Russia does not appear to be on a trajectory to establish naval
superiority in the region or a true blue-water navy. Most of its
capabilities are not designed for offensive power projection but rather
for close-in perimeter defense and protection of borders. Much of the
growth in infrastructure is intended to conduct nonmilitary missions
such as search and rescue operations or to protect maritime shipping and
energy and economic investments.

However, **[many of Russia's military capabilities and operations in the
Arctic have inherent offensive potential and have been used in
threatening ways.]{.underline}**^31^ **[Its air and naval
forces]{.underline}** have intimidated NATO countries on the northern
and eastern flanks of the alliance with provocative maneuvers; have
increased naval, submarine, and air patrols near Danish and Norwegian
territories; have conducted snap military drills in the region; and
**[have used more aggressive tactics to harass U.S. naval and air
operations off the coast of Alaska.]{.underline}**^32^ Moreover, many
Russian facilities being developed along the NSR are dual-use, and
Russian measures to improve maritime security and safety, such as
improved radar surveillance and communications or new drone bases, have
inherent offensive potential.^33^

Russia's primary operational focus is defense of the territory and seas
surrounding the Kola Peninsula and denial of access to this region by
U.S./NATO forces. But implementing an extended defense-in-depth for its
SSBNs requires deployments through the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap, which
would pose an increased threat to NATO's sea lines of communication and
carrier battle groups.^34^ Perhaps most importantly, **[Russia's
intentions could change if U.S./NATO actions]{.underline}**---for
example, the deployment of more advanced missile defense or ASW assets
in or near the region---**[heighten its threat perceptions. Should this
occur, Moscow will have additional incentives to shift from a
defense-oriented strategy to a more offense-minded posture built on
greater force-projection capabilities.]{.underline}**
