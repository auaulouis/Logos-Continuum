[The Arctic plays a **significant role** in Russia's self-identity as a
**great power** because Russia has historically perceived the Arctic to
largely belong in its **sphere of influence** and because Russia boasts
**regional hegemony** in the area]{.underline}. [Russia's security
posture aims to maintain Russia's sphere of influence to safeguard it
against external threats, particularly in areas of strategic importance
such as the Arctic.]{.underline} While the [U.S.]{.underline} is by far
the most powerful Arctic state, its **[limited presence]{.underline}**
[in the Arctic has granted Russia de-facto hegemony in the
region.]{.underline} In terms of the greatest capabilities deployed in
the region and the fact that [Russia has the **largest Arctic
fleet**]{.underline} [capable of year-round power]{.underline}
[projection]{.underline}, [Russia is the **commanding military
power**]{.underline}. However, [Russia has **increasingly perceived**
the U.S. and NATO as trying to **reduce and replace its influence** in
its **historic sphere of influence.**]{.underline}

Over the last few decades, Russia has sought to increase its military
presence and capabilities in the Arctic to demonstrate and maintain
Russia's power in the region as well as convey it to the U.S. and NATO.
Russia has both re-opened former Soviet military and radar bases on and
around its northern coastline and has built new ones to boast a total of
twenty-seven bases above the Arctic Circle. Additionally, [Russia
intends to add an additional twenty-two icebreakers to its existing
fleet of fifty-five which will significantly increase its already strong
year-round power projection capabilities in the Arctic. Meanwhile, the
U.S. and NATO have responded to Russia's "aggressive" behavior in the
Arctic by building up their own military presences and military
capabilities in the region.]{.underline} [The U.S intends to build six
new icebreakers for the Coast Guard to replace the two in its fleet to
better maintain a persistent presence in the region year-round and has
reopened the Keflavik Naval Air Station in Iceland where it now stations
a bomber task force mission for "strategic deterrence."]{.underline}
NATO has taken similar actions in response to Russia's expanding
military presence by taking steps such as increasing its exercise and
training tempo in the region to "show the world that NATO is relevant,
united, and ready to defend itself".

One implication of Russia's actions in the Arctic involves the
continuation of suspicion and mistrust between Russia and the U.S./NATO
in the future, especially considering Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
[The U.S. and NATO may]{.underline} reasonably [continue to view
Russia's actions in the Arctic with **heightened
suspicion**]{.underline} [and increase their own respective **military
presences** and **capabilities in the Arctic**]{.underline} [to bolster
their own self-defense capacities]{.underline}. The current perspectives
of [each side viewing the other as presenting a potential security
threat leads to **continuing cycles of mutual distrust** and
**uncertainty** between Russia and the U.S./NATO in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [**Geopolitical tensions** and
**suspicions**]{.underline} [will **continue to increase** as this cycle
continues]{.underline}, [which may result in a **destabilizing** and
**increasingly offensive posture in the region**]{.underline}. U.S.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has cited "the importance of
maintaining lines of communication \[with Russia\] amid the ongoing war"
in Ukraine. [Maintaining **open diplomatic**]{.underline} and military
[lines of communication between the U.S. and Moscow on Arctic matters
may be one way to help **minimize misperceptions** by either country in
the Arctic to help reduce tensions or avoid misperceptions that could
lead to **accidental escalation**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the outcome of Russia's war in Ukraine bears the potential
to influence future security and stability in the Arctic regarding
Russia's future on the Arctic Council. Composed of the eight Arctic
states (the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Russia, Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden), the Council is a consensus-based intergovernmental forum
designed to facilitate cooperation and collaboration on Arctic concerns
and which thereby contributes to stability in the region. As a response
to the onset of Russia's invasion to Ukraine, the seven other members of
the Council (the "Arctic 7") suspended political activities and
high-level meetings. While projects that did not involve Russia resumed
as early as the summer of 2022, this decision has pushed back the
progress of inter-Arctic dialogue and cooperation. [Regardless of
whether Russia should win or lose the war in Ukraine, the Arctic 7 may
seek the eventual **re-normalization of Russia into Council activities
to resume full-scale Arctic coordination and cooperation**]{.underline}.
The Arctic 7 may reluctantly prefer this option over the continued
isolation of the largest Arctic state, which would undermine the
fundamental vision of circumpolar cooperation that prompted the
Council's creation in the first place.

[The Arctic remains an evolving arena for **geopolitical
competition**]{.underline} [between Russia and the U.S. and its Arctic
NATO allies, particularly as tensions have **increased** following
**Russia's invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline}. [To help mitigate risks
and preserve stability in the Arctic]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}
[and the U.S.,]{.underline} [along with the rest of the Arctic 7
countries]{.underline}, [must take care to ensure that increased human
activity and military capabilities in the region **do not lead to
accidental or inadvertent escalation**]{.underline} caused by
**[miscommunication]{.underline}** or **[misinterpretation of each
other's actions]{.underline}**. **[Despite the ongoing war in
Ukraine]{.underline}**, [maintaining lines of **diplomatic and military
communication**]{.underline} [with Russia on Arctic matters]{.underline}
[and re-normalizing Russia's participation on the Arctic Council to help
bolster Arctic **cooperation** and **stability may be effective methods
to help do so**]{.underline}.

#### The Arctic may be the key region for US-Russia cooperation which is key to solving Ukraine and risk of nuclear war---joint projects are the stepping stones to overall relations---US can use Arctic cooperation to prevent and check Russia-China cooperation as well as spillover to bigger US-Russia issues such as arms control middle east and global health

[US-Russia talks]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin phone
call [signal a possible negotiation for peace in Ukraine and **new
opportunities** for the countries' relations, **including** in the
**Arctic region**.]{.underline}

[The Arctic]{.underline}, warming four times faster than the rest of the
world, [may be the key region for the **US** and **Russia** to **advance
cooperation**]{.underline}. [**US-Russia rapprochement**
may]{.underline} [broadly benefit the world by **bringing an end** to
the **disastrous war** in **Ukraine** and **reducing** the **risk of
nuclear war**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [**existential**
environmental **issues** still **demand attention**.]{.underline}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, **[Kirill
Dmitriev]{.underline}**, [CEO of the **Russian Direct Investment
Fund**]{.underline}, [named the region as a potential setting for
US-Russia cooperation]{.underline}: "[We need to pursue **joint
projects**]{.underline}, [including, for example, in the]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline}." [The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for
cooperation as the two sides have explicitly expressed interest in
exploring cooperation in energy, investment, and geopolitical issues.
Western sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation
in the Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for
Arctic shipping. US officials now see Arctic cooperation as a potential
means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline}

In my meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is
clear that many [are **interested** in **diverse forms** of **Arctic**
**cooperation**,]{.underline} from cultural diplomacy that celebrates
the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering
Strait, [to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate
hazards faced by both nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however,
are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the]{.underline} [countries' diplomatic missions]{.underline} [will
significantly **reduce** the **current obstacles** to US-**Russia
scientific cooperation** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. By making it
easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries, [Americans
and Russians]{.underline} [will]{.underline} again [be able
to]{.underline} [conduct joint research]{.underline}, expeditions, [and
scientific conferences]{.underline} and build models to better
understand the unfolding climate emergency. [Scientific
cooperation]{.underline} to understand the changes affecting sea ice,
permafrost, ecosystems, and local communities [has been blunted by the
**political fallout** of the **war** in **Ukraine**.]{.underline}

**[Cooperation]{.underline}** [in the Arctic can help **build regional
stability**]{.underline}. More importantly, **[Arctic]{.underline}**
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [will **build trust** between the
**US**]{.underline} [and **Russia** that could]{.underline}
[**complement** or **spill over** into other **crucial fields** of
**cooperation** such as **arms** **control**, **Middle East peace**, and
**global health**.]{.underline}

[The Arctic region]{.underline} [has rapidly emerged as a
**strategically** critical **geopolitical zone,**]{.underline} driven
largely by significant environmental changes that have unveiled new
economic and security opportunities. [With melting ice opening access to
vast reserves of]{.underline} oil, natural gas, and
**[minerals]{.underline}**, alongside emerging maritime routes like the
Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, [the **region** has become
**increasingly contested** by **major global powers**]{.underline}.
[Under the Trump administration, U.S. policy towards the Arctic was
assertively **reshaped**, prioritizing **energy independence**, national
security, and **economic deregulation**]{.underline}. [These shifts
highlight broader strategic ambitions while simultaneously sparking
debates around **environmental sustainability**, diplomatic cooperation,
and **geopolitical stability**.]{.underline}

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration's [policy reflected a **clear
emphasis** on exploiting the **Arctic's** **economic
potential**]{.underline} [through resource extraction and **increased
commercial** **shipping**.]{.underline} However, such a focus drew
significant criticism from environmentalists and indigenous communities,
concerned about the irreversible ecological impacts and acceleration of
climate change due to aggressive development strategies. The
administration's rollback of environmental protections to facilitate
drilling operations underscored its prioritization of short-term
economic benefits over long-term ecological sustainability.

A particularly striking illustration of Trump's Arctic strategy was his
repeated interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark, first expressed
publicly in 2019 and reiterated again more recently in 2025. This highly
controversial proposal highlighted Greenland's strategic importance,
particularly its potential as a base for military and economic
expansion, reflecting Trump's broader ambition to assert American
dominance in the region. Greenland's leadership swiftly and firmly
rejected the proposal, underscoring the significance of national
sovereignty and self-determination. This diplomatic tension illuminated
broader sensitivities and complexities in Arctic geopolitics, including
issues of sovereignty, national identity, and resource nationalism.

[The administration's focus also significantly addressed **national
security concerns** arising from **increased Russian military
activities** and strategic advancements in the Arctic.]{.underline} In
response, [the U.S. **intensified** its **military
presence**]{.underline}, [investing heavily in]{.underline} [**essential
infrastructure** like]{.underline} **[icebreakers]{.underline}** and
surveillance systems. [Trump-era]{.underline} [rhetoric]{.underline}
consistently **[emphasized]{.underline}** the need for American
leadership in safeguarding national interests, framing [the Arctic as a
critical arena for geopolitical competition, particularly **against
Russian**]{.underline} and Chinese **[ambitions]{.underline}**.

However, critics argued that [the **Trump** administration's **largely
unilateral**]{.underline} and [short-**sighted economic**
approach]{.underline} [**risked destabilizing** established multilateral
frameworks such as the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [These
frameworks]{.underline} historically [facilitated]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} among Arctic nations, providing a balanced
mechanism for managing shared resources, mitigating environmental risks,
and **[reducing geopolitical tensions]{.underline}**. [Trump's reduced
**commitment** to such cooperative frameworks risked alienating
traditional allies and **intensifying regional rivalries**,
**potentially undermining long-term stability.**]{.underline}

The economic opportunities presented by the Arctic region are
undoubtedly significant, particularly regarding shorter shipping routes
and abundant natural resources. Nonetheless, the risks posed by rapid
development without robust environmental safeguards are equally
substantial. The potential for ecological disasters, acceleration of
global climate impacts, and disruption of local indigenous communities'
livelihoods remain critical concerns. Additionally, heightened
geopolitical competition absent meaningful diplomatic engagement could
escalate tensions, increasing instability within the region.

Trump-era Arctic policy thus exemplifies a broader geopolitical
challenge: balancing immediate economic and national security interests
with the imperative for sustainable development and cooperative
international relations. As the Arctic continues to evolve due to
climate change and geopolitical pressures, it becomes increasingly
crucial for policymakers to adopt balanced, sustainable strategies.
These should emphasize not only resource management but also meaningful
engagement with indigenous communities, enhanced diplomatic
collaboration, and comprehensive environmental stewardship.

Ultimately, [the growing strategic importance of the Arctic in a new
Trump era underscores critical lessons in **geopolitical
decision-making**]{.underline}. Future policy must reconcile short-term
national ambitions with the long-term demands of ecological
sustainability and international cooperation. An integrated and nuanced
approach is essential to navigating the complex opportunities and
challenges emerging from this dynamically evolving region.

## 1NC Shell---Arctic Cooperation 

#### Uniqueness/Brink\--The Arctic region is becoming a stage for great power wars -- Multilateral cooperation is key to ensure the Arctic remains stable and secure 

**James, author for OTH, and Bodtke, helicopter pilot in the Air Force,

\[Jessie and Rebecca "Uncharted Waters: Shaping the Future of Arctic
Security", Over the Horizon Journal, March 14, 2025 \[Uncharted Waters:
Shaping the Future of Arctic Security - Over The Horizon Journal\]
7/14/2025 HDCSW - EO\]

The ASDC made clear that **[the Arctic's strategic importance is no
longer a distant concern but rather an]{.underline} [immediate
priority]{.underline}.** The U.S. National Security Strategy refers to
the 2020s as the "decisive decade," with the Arctic playing a pivotal
role in shaping global stability. **[As climate change accelerates the
ice]{.underline} [melt and opens new sea routes, the region is becoming
a key stage for great power competition.]{.underline}**

**[Russia and China's increasing Arctic influence poses substantial
challenges to U.S. and allied interests.]{.underline} [The strategic
alignment between Russia and China creates a complex environment where
competition]{.underline} [could escalate into confrontation if left
unchecked. A proactive, multilateral approach is essential]{.underline}
[to ensure the Arctic remains stable and secure.]{.underline}**

The implications of this strategic convergence are profound. Russia,
with its vast Arctic coastline and longstanding regional presence, has
significantly expanded its military infrastructure, including an
enhanced network of Arctic bases and a bolstered Northern Fleet. While
this could be seen as a logical step for a nation with substantial
territorial interests in the region, it raises critical concerns.
**[Russia's]{.underline} [actions]{.underline}** are not limited to
defense; they represent a broader bid **[to assert dominance over
essential]{.underline} [shipping routes, energy reserves, and regional
governance structures. This buildup challenges the]{.underline}
[cooperative norms that have historically governed Arctic relations and
introduces the potential for]{.underline} [heightened tensions among
Arctic states.]{.underline}**

China's Arctic ambitions further complicate the situation. Although not
an Arctic nation, China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," a
self-proclaimed status that challenges the region's established norms of
sovereignty and governance. Through its Polar Silk Road initiative,
China seeks to develop new shipping routes and embed itself in the
Arctic economy with substantial investments in infrastructure and energy
exploration. These moves signal Beijing's intent to become a long-term
stakeholder in the Arctic, leveraging its economic power to shape the
region's future in ways that may conflict with the interests of the U.S.
and its allies.

**[These actions raise the stakes for all Arctic nations, highlighting
the need for vigilance and]{.underline} [cooperation among allies to
deter potential aggression and uphold the norms of peaceful]{.underline}
[collaboration]{.underline}**. The increasing presence and strategic
alignment of **[Russia and China]{.underline}** in the Arctic are not
just regional issues---they are global challenges. **[These developments
could reshape the governance, security, and economic dynamics of the
Arctic, with far-reaching consequences for international
stability.]{.underline}** Understanding and addressing these
implications is critical to ensuring that the Arctic remains a region of
cooperation rather than conflict.

Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} worked cooperatively to reduce the risk of
nuclear conflict and decrease the size of their arsenals. By 2022,
[[cooperation began disintegrating as Russia's botched invasion of
Ukraine]{.mark} [[raised serious concerns about nuclear

Battle of the Atlantic extended into the Arctic and ships carrying
American war supplies to the Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea
Route. Germany invaded Norway, and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in
the Winter War of 1940. As the Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a
major theater for submarine activity.

Today, President [Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland ["one way or
the
other"](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-says-the-us-will-take-greenland-one-way-or-the-other.html) highlights
the growing importance of the Arctic to the security interests of the
United States]{.underline}. Greenland's geographic location, combined
with the U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space Base in the high north,
provides key ["missile warning, missile defense, and space
surveillance"](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341505/greenland-pituffik-space-military-base) capabilities.
The shortest flight paths for nuclear missiles between the U.S. and
Russia exist over the Arctic Ocean, and the loss of this base on account
of a diplomatic blunder could open a key blind spot in America's
strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian
attack aimed at disabling American missile detection infrastructure is
unlikely due to the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.\>

#### Uniqueness/Brink---Russian perception of encirclement---Recent US moves including ICE Pact and Russian sanctions create perception of Russian encirclement increasing the risk of tension\--Icebreakers are considered an escalatory move by the US vs Russia and China

[As the world fixates on the battlefields of Ukraine and the volatile
Middle East, a quieter but no less consequential struggle is unfolding
in the Arctic. Washington's latest maneuver---planning to acquire
icebreakers from Finland amid what some call an "Arctic
crisis"---signals a bold escalation in the polar region in the context
of competition with Beijing and Moscow.]{.underline}

[This move, paired with]{.underline} the Danish Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen's recent trip to Greenland, and President Donald [Trump's
proposed energy sanctions targeting Russia]{.underline}n liquefied
natural gas (LNG) expansion (if he doesn't change his mind), [reveals a
troubling pattern]{.underline}: once again, this has everything to do
with the [US-led NATO's relentless push to encircle Russia, even at the
risk of igniting a new geopolitical flashpoint]{.underline} (even if
Trump seems to be "turning his back" to the Alliance).

[The Arctic]{.underline}, far from being a frozen backwater, [is poised
to become the next major arena of U.S.-Russian contention---a
development that exposes Trump's America imperial ambitions and
undermines claims of "isolationism" or of fostering peace and stability
for that matter]{.underline}. Ironically, we now have an American
president openly threatening (with annexation) the sovereignty of NATO
European "ally", Denmark, over the issue of Greenland.

#### Uniqueness/Brink---Gulf of Finland scenario---NATO expansion and US actions raised tension risk and fracturing cooperation in the Arctic 

Uriel **Araujo, researcher with a focus on international and ethnic
conflicts, April, 5, 2025** ("The Arctic's transformation into a

HDCSW---CX

Additionally (and relatedly), still during Biden's administration,
[tensions have escalated in the Gulf of Finland.]{.underline} It's worth
noting that [NATO's further expansion]{.underline} under Biden,
[incorporating Sweden and Finland, has extended the Alliance's territory
all the way to Russia's eastern Arctic flank (the Bering Strait), thus
leaving Russia as the sole non-NATO country in the Arctic.]{.underline}
This is the context for Trump's Greenland and Arctic "obsession".

NATO's cheerleaders might argue that all of this is a necessary response
to Russian "aggression." After all, they claim, Moscow has militarized
its Arctic frontier, with nuclear-powered icebreakers and new combat
vessels like the Ivan Papanin. But this narrative conveniently ignores
NATO's own history of provocations. [The alliance's eastward
creep---absorbing Finland and Sweden---has turned the Gulf of Finland
into a potential "site of new conflict,"]{.underline} as I've written
before.

[Finland's integration into the ICE Pact and its icebreaker
expertise,]{.underline} means that the Nordic country, once a neutral
asset, [now serves NATO's agenda]{.underline}---even when the incumbent
American President is accused of "abandoning" the transatlantic
alliance. [This shift has strained Arctic cooperation, with Russia
excluded from regional forums like the Arctic Council since 2022. Far
from stabilizing the region, the United States actions are fracturing
it.]{.underline}

#### Uniqueness/Brink/A2---Greenland---Trump's Greenland obsession heightens Russian fears of encirclement---all policies will be filtered through this lens for Russia

[The Greenland obsession epitomizes this overreach. Trump's
fixation]{.underline}, dismissed as eccentric in 2019, [now aligns with
a calculated NATO strategy]{.underline}, even while Trumps go as far as
to threaten a member ally such as the Kingdom of Denmark. One may very
well describe it as ["part of a scramble for the Arctic,"]{.underline}
(as Al-Jazeera called it) [given Greenland's strategic position astride
key shipping routes and its mineral wealth.]{.underline}

Denmark is ramping up its Arctic defenses, yet its sovereignty over
Greenland is increasingly a bargaining chip in Washington's game.
Putin's remarks at an Arctic conference underscore [Moscow's alarm: the
U.S. isn't just eyeing territory---it's projecting power into Russia's
backyard. This isn't deterrence; it's encirclement.]{.underline}

Since 2007 when a Russian submersible planted a ceremonial Russian flag
on the North Pole seabed, Russia has increased its military presence in
the Arctic in various ways, provoking similar responses by the United
States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **[The Arctic has always
been important to Russia because it not only forms a core part of
Russian national identity and serves as an economic resource base, but
it is also perceived by Russia to be a critical area for its defense
capabilities. Russia's increased military presence in the Arctic is
motivated by]{.underline}** security concerns primarily stemming from
two factors. The first factor is Russia's perception of needing to
strengthen its self-defense capabilities. The second factor is
**[maintaining Russia's regional hegemony against what it perceives as
threatening efforts by the U.S. and NATO to contain its influence in a
strategically important region to Russia.]{.underline}** However, the
implications of Russia's actions and the reactions by the U.S. and NATO
have the potential to threaten future Arctic security and stability.

[**The Arctic plays a significant role in Russia's self-identity as a
great power because Russia has historically perceived the Arctic to
largely belong in its sphere of influence and because Russia boasts
regional hegemony in the area**.]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**'s
security posture **[aims to maintain Russia's sphere of
influence]{.underline}** to safeguard it against external threats,
particularly in areas of strategic importance such as the Arctic.
[**While the U.S. is**]{.underline} by far [**the most powerful Arctic
state, its limited presence in the Arctic has granted Russia de-facto
hegemony in the region**.]{.underline} In terms of the greatest
capabilities deployed in the region and the fact that Russia has the
largest Arctic fleet capable of year-round power projection, Russia is
the commanding military power. However, **[Russia has increasingly
perceived the U.S. and NATO as trying to reduce and replace its
influence in its historic sphere of influence.]{.underline}**

Over the last few decades[**, Russia has sought to increase its military
presence and capabilities in the Arctic to demonstrate and maintain
Russia's power in the region as well as convey it to the U.S. and
NATO**. Russia has both re-opened former Soviet military and radar bases
on and around its northern coastline and has built new ones to boast a
total of twenty-seven bases above the Arctic Circle.]{.underline}
Additionally, [Russia intends to add an additional twenty-two
icebreakers to its]{.underline} existing [fleet of
fifty-five]{.underline} which will significantly increase its already
strong year-round power projection capabilities in the Arctic.
Meanwhile, the U.S. and NATO have responded to Russia's "aggressive"
behavior in the Arctic by building up their own military presences and
military capabilities in the region. The U.S intends to build six new
icebreakers for the Coast Guard to replace the two in its fleet to
better maintain a persistent presence in the region year-round and has
reopened the Keflavik Naval Air Station in Iceland where it now stations
a bomber task force mission for "strategic deterrence." NATO has taken
similar actions in response to Russia's expanding military presence by
taking steps such as increasing its exercise and training tempo in the
region to "show the world that NATO is relevant, united, and ready to
defend itself".

[The Arctic]{.underline}, often [associated with serene landscapes and
wildlife,]{.underline} is not just a picturesque region but a
[strategically important area shaped by environmental, political,
economic, and military forces. During the Cold War]{.underline}, it was
a [battleground between]{.underline} the United States
[(US)]{.underline}, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
[(NATO]{.underline}), and the [Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
(USSR). Post-Cold War, Arctic nations sought to preserve it as a zone of
cooperation.1]{.underline}) However, the [strategic competition among
the US, Russia, and]{.underline} the [P]{.underline}eople's Republic of
China [(PRC)]{.underline} has [significantly elevated its geopolitical
importance in the past decade.]{.underline} [The military advancements
of Russia]{.underline} and [PRC, in contrast to slower efforts by the US

gas]{.underline}.2) That [same year]{.underline}, the [US hosted the

unprecedented;]{.underline} in 2007, Russian submarines [planted a
Russian flag on the North Pole, proclaiming, "The Arctic is

[**Russia** and the **U**nited **S**tates **discussed** possible
**cooperation** on energy projects in **the Arctic**]{.underline} at a
meeting in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO.

Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment
Fund (RDIF), said the economic conversations had been about broad
strokes, but that [the two sides had discussed some "specific areas of
cooperation."]{.underline}

"It was more a general discussion --- maybe **[joint projects in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** We specifically discussed the Arctic," [Dmitriev
said]{.underline} by phone as he boarded a flight home after the talks
in Riyadh.

The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst
and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and
Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine's future
without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies.

For his part, **[Trump]{.underline}** [aims to expand **American
influence** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, having repeatedly mused
about acquiring Greenland from Denmark --- and has refused to rule out
using military force or economic coercion to seize control of the
massive island with its vast mineral wealth and key strategic location.

U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian state oil major
Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic, but pulled out
in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in response to
Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Dmitriev was part of [a Russian delegation]{.underline} that included
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri
Ushakov and was in Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine.
Tuesday's talks were the first contact between officials from the two
sides following a call between Trump and Putin last week.

He [commented on the economic **track of the talks**]{.underline},
[which he **described** as **good**]{.underline}, but declined to go
into detail on the political discussions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by National Security Adviser Mike
Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

"[**Positive** after the **Biden administration** destroyed all of the
**communication**, **destroyed** all of the
**discussion**]{.underline}," he said.

In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the
RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around \$300 billion as a result of
leaving Russia following Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022.

"[There is an understanding that bad relations between Russia and the
U.S. actually cost a lot to American business, and there are ways to
have productive cooperation **benefit** both **Russia** and **the
U.S.**"]{.underline} he said.

"I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going
forward, but I think [**joint investments** between Russia]{.underline}
[and the U.S. are **now more likely** after this **meeting than
before**,]{.underline}" he added.

[On next steps, Dmitriev said the two sides had **agreed to set up
working groups** and have **regular high-level contacts**.]{.underline}
No further meetings have yet been scheduled.

The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on
projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign
fund was sidelined following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as
foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia.
Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a
statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

[Trump's recent assertive strategy in]{.underline} relation to [the
Arctic]{.underline} primarily [hinges on undermining Chinese influence
in the region, sending a]{.underline} robust [message to Beijing that
the U.S. will not allow China to expand its Arctic
interests.]{.underline} Increasingly, [the Arctic is becoming a region
critical to great power competition, where the U.S., China, and Russia
compete]{.underline} for access and advantage.

Russia remains the most dominant power in the Arctic from an economic
and military standpoint, with military bases, icebreakers, and nuclear
submarines. [Moscow has also engaged in joint military drills with
Beijing in the Arctic]{.underline} and economically, has expanded its
oil, gas, and shipping routes along the Northern Sea Route. While
climate change is wreaking havoc in many parts of the world, with
coastal flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather events, melting
sea ice is providing opportunities for countries to find new shipping
lanes and begin exploration on access to natural resources that were
previously unavailable.

Trump appears less focused on great power competition than previous U.S.
presidents, as evidenced by his recent isolationist policies and
actions. These include tariff wars with Mexico, Canada, China, and, for
a time, Colombia, as well as his growing relationship with Russia and
his eagerness to end the Russo-Ukrainian war quickly, regardless of the
cost. This shift in priorities is perhaps particularly evident in the
recent and significant realignment of U.S. Arctic policy. On February
18, [at a meeting]{.underline} in Saudi Arabia, R[ussia and the United
States discussed potential collaboration on Arctic energy projects and
explored ideas for joint ventures in the region]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} development suggests a shift away from NATO-led
multilateral frameworks towards U.S.-Russian bilateral cooperation,
challenging the post-2022 Arctic order. Furthermore, it [highlights the
Trump administration's readiness to directly engage with
Russia]{.underline}, departing from previous isolationist stances [and
could]{.underline} indicate a strategy to [drive a wedge between Russia
and China in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Putin made clear before the invasion that he sees the conflict as
righting a historic wrong --- both over Russia's age-old claims to
Ukraine and his wider grievances that date back to the fall of the
Berlin Wall,]{.underline} which [he watched with dismay from his post as
a KGB lieutenant colonel in communist East Germany. Putin talks of the
"root causes" of the war.]{.underline} This is [code for a number of
Russian grievances that include the existence of a democratic government
in Kyiv]{.underline}. It [sometimes refers to Moscow's claims that it is
threatened by NATO expansion after the Cold War and to its desire to see
alliance troops withdrawn from former communist states once in the
Soviet Union's orbit, such as Poland and Romania.]{.underline} From this
[perspective, Putin may not have intended ever to end the war, and the
calculations of Trump and his aides that he could be persuaded to do a
"deal" --- the central assumption of the president's entire worldview
--- was misguided.]{.underline} And [after hundreds of thousands of
Russian casualties, the war may be existential to Putin for his
political survival. Countless US and European observers have tried to
convince Trump of this view for years. In a way, it's stunning that
Trump took so long to reach this point.]{.underline} [The president
[said this
week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-frustration-analysis)
of Putin, "He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be
meaningless." Ukraine hawks hoping for a newly robust US policy on the
war may want to temper their enthusiasm. Trump's frustration with Putin
does seem genuine this time. But several times in recent months, he's
criticized the Russian leader only to later caveat his
anger.]{.underline}

important consideration here. From a Western perspective, the Russian
leader may be guilty of an extraordinary self-inflicted political gaffe.
He could have had a US-backed peace deal that Ukraine's allies in Europe
feared would reward his aggression, that locked in the territorial gains
of the invasion, and that would have set in stone that Ukraine would
never have a path to NATO membership. But imposing Western logic on

to its colossal geo-economic potential as well as a factor of Russia\'s

[The Arctic]{.underline}, often associated with serene landscapes and
wildlife, [is not just a picturesque region but a **strategically
important area** shaped]{.underline} [by **environmental**,
**political**]{.underline}, **[economic]{.underline}**, [and **military
forces**]{.underline}. During the Cold War, [it was a battleground
between the]{.underline} United States (**[US]{.underline}**), the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline}
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (**[USSR]{.underline}**).
Post-Cold War, [Arctic nations sought to preserve it as a zone of
cooperation]{.underline}.1) **[However]{.underline}**, [the **strategic
competition** among the US, Russia, and the People's Republic of
China]{.underline} (PRC) [has **significantly elevated its geopolitical
importance**]{.underline} in the past decade. [The **military
advancements** of Russia and PRC, in contrast to slower efforts by the
US and NATO, have turned the Arctic **into a critical focus for
security**]{.underline}, **[resource access]{.underline}**, and
**[control over emerging shipping routes]{.underline}**.

In 2009, global interest in the Arctic surged when the US Geological
Survey estimated the Arctic held 13 percent of the world's undiscovered
oil and 30 percent of the world's natural gas.2) That same year, the US
hosted the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting to reaffirm cooperation.
When Russia asserted its claims over arctic territory, **[the tone
shifted from collaboration to competition.]{.underline}** **[Russia's

### Links---Deterrence

#### Link/Internal link---provocative military behavior by the US causes escalation to nuclear exchange

**Matthew Wallin, CEO of American Security Project, May 12, 2025** "Is
the Arctic Destined to be the Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear
War?"American Security Project, accessed at
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/

[What is most concerning is that provocative military behavior anywhere
could lead to an unintentional cycle of escalation that ultimately
results in a nuclear exchange. As the Arctic opens to more military and
commercial activity, the frequency of encounters between military forces
is likely to increase. As those encounters increase, so too does the
probability that an accident or unintended attack may
occur.]{.underline} As Russia [routinely flies patrols into the Alaska
Air Defense Identification
Zone](https://www.foxnews.com/us/russian-aircraft-fly-alaskan-air-defense-identification-zone-us-says),
an area of international air space in which the U.S. identifies all
aircraft, aggressive behavior by Russian pilots raises the risk of a
routine encounter evolving into an international incident. But these
aggressive incidents are [much more frequent
elsewhere](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/us-russia-relationship/russian-military-incident-tracker/),
like the Baltic and North Seas. For example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27
fighter jet [fired two missiles against a British RC-135 surveillance
jet](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66798508) over the Black Sea, but
fortunately neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is known
for conducting [frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign
aircraft](https://news.usni.org/2023/10/17/pentagon-officials-provide-data-on-unsafe-chinese-fighter-intercepts-over-western-pacific) in
the East and South China Seas.

[In the end, the likeliness that the Arctic or any other region sees the
confrontation leading to nuclear war is more about the actors involved
and the choices they make rather than the regions themselves. Actors
committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes will find ways to
preserve that peace. Yet in an era of machismo, confrontation, and
conquest, we could all find ourselves walking off a dangerous cliff from
which there is no return.]{.underline}

[For the US, communication lines between the **East** and the **West**
are served by the]{.underline} **[Panama Canal]{.underline}**, [rather
than by the Northwest Passage]{.underline} along the Canadian Arctic
coastline. Not only is the Passage very complicated for navigation, it
is also a matter of a long-term dispute between Washington and Ottawa -
the Canadian government considers the Passage as a part of Canadian
internal waters, while the US claims that this is an international
strait allowing free and unencumbered navigation. In any case, [it is
hard to imagine that either the US]{.underline}, or Canada, or any other

As the world fixates on the battlefields of Ukraine and the volatile
Middle East, a quieter but no less consequential struggle is unfolding
in the Arctic. [Washington's latest maneuver---planning to acquire
**icebreakers**]{.underline} from Finland **[amid]{.underline}** what
some call [an "**Arctic crisis**"---signals a **bold escalation** in the
**polar region** in the context of **competition** with **Beijing** and
**Moscow**.]{.underline}

[This move]{.underline}, paired with the Danish Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen's recent trip to Greenland, and President Donald Trump's
proposed energy sanctions targeting Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG)
expansion (if he doesn't change his mind), reveals a troubling pattern:
once again, this [has everything to do with the US-led NATO's
**relentless** push to **encircle Russia**]{.underline}, [even at the
risk of **igniting a new geopolitical flashpoint**]{.underline} (even if
Trump seems to be "turning his back" to the Alliance).

[The Arctic,]{.underline} far from being a frozen backwater, [is poised
to become the next major arena of **U.S.-Russian contention**---a
development that exposes **Trump's America**]{.underline} **[imperial
ambitions]{.underline}** [and undermines claims of "**isolationism**" or
of **fostering peace** and **stability** for that matter.]{.underline}
Ironically, we now have an American president openly threatening (with
annexation) the sovereignty of NATO European "ally", Denmark, over the
issue of Greenland.

The icebreaker deal with Finland is no mere logistical upgrade. Trump
has framed it as a critical step "amid Arctic security concerns," with
Washington aiming to bolster its polar presence against Russia's
formidable fleet of over 36 icebreakers. One should pay attention also
to the trilateral ICE Pact with Canada and Finland; expert Daniel
McVicar (Research Director at White House Writers Group), predicts Trump
will expand it to counter "Russian influence."

Meanwhile, the Danish Prime Minister's visit to Greenland, underscores
Washington's broader strategy to secure strategic footholds in the
region. Greenland, a Danish territory, has long been a target of Trump's
fixation---he recently reiterated his desire to "get Greenland," ---a
notion Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a "serious" U.S.
intent. These moves are not about defense; they are about dominance.

Trump's proposed energy sanctions, exceeding the scope of the 2019
measures, aim to choke Russia's LNG ambitions, which are deeply tied to
the Arctic. Russia's Northern Sea Route, a thawing shipping lane along
its Arctic coast, promises to redirect energy exports to Asia,
circumventing Western chokeholds like the Suez Canal. By targeting this
lifeline, the U.S. seeks to kneecap Moscow's economic resilience---a
tactic less about security and more about maintaining American hegemony.
[The region's vast untapped resources]{.underline}, from oil and gas to
rare earth minerals, [only **heighten** the **stakes**]{.underline}. One
may recall that the U.S. (then still under President Joe Biden, mind
you) has already claimed a "huge portion of the ocean floor" from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic, a unilateral grab that flouts
international norms and highlights the American expansionist ethos.

Increasingly warm temperatures in the Arctic region, which facilitate
navigation, present a significant opportunity for the liquefied natural
gas industry, among other benefits, hence the strategic importance of
that area. Additionally (and relatedly), still during Biden's
administration, tensions have escalated in the Gulf of Finland. It's
worth noting that NATO's further expansion under Biden, incorporating
Sweden and Finland, has extended the Alliance's territory all the way to
Russia's eastern Arctic flank (the Bering Strait), thus leaving Russia
as the sole non-NATO country in the Arctic. This is the context for
Trump's Greenland and Arctic "obsession".

[NATO's cheerleaders might argue that all of this is a necessary
response to Russian "**aggression**."]{.underline} After all, they
claim, Moscow has militarized its Arctic frontier, with nuclear-powered
icebreakers and new combat vessels like the Ivan Papanin. [But this
narrative conveniently **ignores NATO's** own **history** of
**provocations**]{.underline}. [The alliance's **eastward
creep**---absorbing **Finland** and **Sweden**---has turned the **Gulf
of Finland** into a potential "**site of new conflict**," as I've
written before.]{.underline}

Finland's integration into the ICE Pact and its icebreaker expertise,
means that the Nordic country, once a neutral asset, now serves NATO's
agenda---even when the incumbent American President is accused of
"abandoning" the transatlantic alliance. [This shift has strained
**Arctic cooperation**]{.underline}, [with Russia excluded from regional
forums like the **Arctic Council** since **2022**]{.underline}. [Far
from **stabilizing** the **region**, the **U**nited **S**tates
**actions** are **fracturing it**.]{.underline}

The Greenland obsession epitomizes this overreach. Trump's fixation,
dismissed as eccentric in 2019, now aligns with a calculated NATO
strategy, even while Trumps go as far as to threaten a member ally such
as the Kingdom of Denmark. One may very well describe it as "part of a
scramble for the Arctic," (as Al-Jazeera called it) given Greenland's
strategic position astride key shipping routes and its mineral wealth.

Denmark is ramping up its Arctic defenses, yet its sovereignty over
Greenland is increasingly a bargaining chip in Washington's game.
Putin's remarks at an Arctic conference underscore Moscow's alarm: the
U.S. isn't just eyeing territory---it's projecting power into Russia's
backyard. This isn't deterrence; it's encirclement.

One must ask: who benefits from this Arctic gambit? Certainly not the
global commons. The ICE Pact and sanctions risk escalating tensions in a
region where cooperation---on climate, shipping, and resource
management---once held promise. [Even from an American perspective,
Russia's exclusion from Arctic dialogue pushes Moscow toward
China]{.underline} (the exact opposite of what Trump supposedly is
trying to achieve by means of a so-called "reverse Kissinger" strategy),
in a context of a New Cold War, thereby [forming a counter bloc that
could **destabilize the polar balance further**]{.underline}. China's
"Polar Silk Road" ambitions, paired with Russia's icebreaking prowess,
challenge NATO's aggressive dominance, yet the alliance's
response---more militarization, more sanctions---only deepens the
divide.

The Arctic should not be NATO's next frontier. Its transformation into a
geopolitical chessboard reflects the alliance's Cold War reflexes,
ill-suited to an emerging multipolar world. [Trump's icebreaker
push]{.underline} and energy sanctions **[may]{.underline}** bolster
U.S. leverage, but they also [**invite retaliation**---perhaps in the
Gulf of Finland, or through Russia's LNG pivot to Asia.]{.underline} [To
recap, the **U.S. claims** vast **swathes** of **seabed**, NATO tightens
its grip on Greenland, and Finland's shipyards churn out tools of
confrontation. **This isn't security**---it's a **recipe for
conflict**.]{.underline}

[A saner approach would **prioritize de-escalation**]{.underline}:
[**reintegrating Russia** into Arctic forums, negotiating
resource-sharing pacts, and curbing NATO's northward sprawl. The
**Arctic's future hinges** on **cooperation**, **not
conquest**]{.underline}. [Yet as Washington **doubles down**, dragging
its allies along, the ice grows thinner---both literally and
figuratively]{.underline}. In fact, [the next **U.S.-Russian clash** may
erupt not in Ukraine or Syria, but rather in the **frozen
north,**]{.underline} [where **NATO's hubris** could **spark a fire no
icebreaker can extinguish.**]{.underline}

[The Arctic region]{.underline} [has rapidly emerged as a
**strategically** critical **geopolitical zone,**]{.underline} driven
largely by significant environmental changes that have unveiled new
economic and security opportunities. [With melting ice opening access to
vast reserves of]{.underline} oil, natural gas, and
**[minerals]{.underline}**, alongside emerging maritime routes like the
Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, [the **region** has become
**increasingly contested** by **major global powers**]{.underline}.
[Under the Trump administration, U.S. policy towards the Arctic was
assertively **reshaped**, prioritizing **energy independence**, national
security, and **economic deregulation**]{.underline}. [These shifts
highlight broader strategic ambitions while simultaneously sparking
debates around **environmental sustainability**, diplomatic cooperation,
and **geopolitical stability**.]{.underline}

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration's [policy reflected a **clear
emphasis** on exploiting the **Arctic's** **economic
potential**]{.underline} [through resource extraction and **increased
commercial** **shipping**.]{.underline} However, such a focus drew
significant criticism from environmentalists and indigenous communities,
concerned about the irreversible ecological impacts and acceleration of
climate change due to aggressive development strategies. The
administration's rollback of environmental protections to facilitate
drilling operations underscored its prioritization of short-term
economic benefits over long-term ecological sustainability.

A particularly striking illustration of Trump's Arctic strategy was his
repeated interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark, first expressed
publicly in 2019 and reiterated again more recently in 2025. This highly
controversial proposal highlighted Greenland's strategic importance,
particularly its potential as a base for military and economic
expansion, reflecting Trump's broader ambition to assert American
dominance in the region. Greenland's leadership swiftly and firmly
rejected the proposal, underscoring the significance of national
sovereignty and self-determination. This diplomatic tension illuminated
broader sensitivities and complexities in Arctic geopolitics, including
issues of sovereignty, national identity, and resource nationalism.

[The administration's focus also significantly addressed **national
security concerns** arising from **increased Russian military
activities** and strategic advancements in the Arctic.]{.underline} In
response, [the U.S. **intensified** its **military
presence**]{.underline}, [investing heavily in]{.underline} [**essential
infrastructure** like]{.underline} **[icebreakers]{.underline}** and
surveillance systems. [Trump-era]{.underline} [rhetoric]{.underline}
consistently **[emphasized]{.underline}** the need for American
leadership in safeguarding national interests, framing [the Arctic as a
critical arena for geopolitical competition, particularly **against
Russian**]{.underline} and Chinese **[ambitions]{.underline}**.

However, critics argued that [the **Trump** administration's **largely
unilateral**]{.underline} and [short-**sighted economic**
approach]{.underline} [**risked destabilizing** established multilateral
frameworks such as the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [These
frameworks]{.underline} historically [facilitated]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} among Arctic nations, providing a balanced
mechanism for managing shared resources, mitigating environmental risks,
and **[reducing geopolitical tensions]{.underline}**. [Trump's reduced
**commitment** to such cooperative frameworks risked alienating
traditional allies and **intensifying regional rivalries**,
**potentially undermining long-term stability.**]{.underline}

The economic opportunities presented by the Arctic region are
undoubtedly significant, particularly regarding shorter shipping routes
and abundant natural resources. Nonetheless, the risks posed by rapid
development without robust environmental safeguards are equally
substantial. The potential for ecological disasters, acceleration of
global climate impacts, and disruption of local indigenous communities'
livelihoods remain critical concerns. Additionally, heightened
geopolitical competition absent meaningful diplomatic engagement could
escalate tensions, increasing instability within the region.

Trump-era Arctic policy thus exemplifies a broader geopolitical
challenge: balancing immediate economic and national security interests
with the imperative for sustainable development and cooperative
international relations. As the Arctic continues to evolve due to
climate change and geopolitical pressures, it becomes increasingly
crucial for policymakers to adopt balanced, sustainable strategies.
These should emphasize not only resource management but also meaningful
engagement with indigenous communities, enhanced diplomatic
collaboration, and comprehensive environmental stewardship.

Ultimately, [the growing strategic importance of the Arctic in a new
Trump era underscores critical lessons in **geopolitical
decision-making**]{.underline}. Future policy must reconcile short-term
national ambitions with the long-term demands of ecological
sustainability and international cooperation. An integrated and nuanced
approach is essential to navigating the complex opportunities and
challenges emerging from this dynamically evolving region.

Take 2: With Russia effectively banished from Arctic cooperation, there

statements about nuclear weapons use in the Arctic. Both sides -- NATO

[Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in the region
among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations,]{.underline} such as China.
[Melting sea ice]{.underline} from rising global temperatures h[as
created new military and economic opportunities]{.underline} in the
region. [Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the
rest of the world,]{.underline} according to an August 2022 scientific
study published in Nature.3) [As ice]{.underline} rapidly
[melts]{.underline} in the Arctic, [increased access to critical rare
earth elements]{.underline}, such as platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt,
and nickel [emerge.]{.underline} Moreover, melting ice is opening more
easily traversed Arctic waters, which has led to a surge of both
military and commercial ship activity in the region. These two
developments have increased the potential for conflict in the Arctic.

Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a strategic advantage. [These minerals are required for
developing technologies ranging from renewable energy systems to
electronics used for national defense.]{.underline} According to the
World Bank, [the demand to produce minerals]{.underline}, many of which
are found in the Arctic, [could increase by nearly 500 percent by
2050]{.underline} to meet the growing demand for clean energy
technologies.4) China already dominates the global supply chain for
critical materials. The United States depends on these materials for its
economic competitiveness and national defense.5)

As ice melts, new routes are emerging that are more navigable. This has
resulted in more ship activity in the region. For instance, the Arctic
Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
reports that [there has been a 37 percent increase in ship
numbers]{.underline} and distance sailed [in the Arctic over the past
ten years.]{.underline}6) While much of this activity is commercial,
[Russia and China]{.underline} have also taken advantage of the new sea
routes to project their naval power. They [have carried out numerous
regional deployments and patrols, demonstrating their ability to execute
military operations in the]{.underline} austere [Arctic]{.underline}
climate.7) [The]{.underline} expanded [presence]{.underline} of Russian
and Chinese ships in the region [poses a growing threat to
NATO]{.underline} member states. In October 2023, Finnish investigators
suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor
over the seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one
pipeline. While the international community has not assigned blame
wholly to China, [China]{.underline} later [admitted to accidentally
destroying an important gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia
in]{.underline} the Baltic Sea in [2024]{.underline}. These examples
suggest that [incidents of this nature could become more likely as
military activity increases]{.underline} in the region.8)

deeply tied to the Arctic. Russia's Northern Sea Route, a thawing
shipping lane along its Arctic coast, promises to redirect energy
exports to Asia, circumventing Western chokeholds like the Suez Canal.
By targeting this lifeline, the U.S. seeks to kneecap Moscow's economic
resilience---a tactic less about security and more about maintaining
American hegemony. The region's vast untapped resources, from oil and
gas to rare earth minerals, only heighten the stakes.]{.underline} One
may recall that the [U.S.]{.underline} (then still under President Joe
Biden, mind you) [has already claimed a "huge portion of the ocean
floor" from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic, a unilateral grab that
flouts international norms and highlights the American expansionist
ethos.]{.underline} Increasingly warm temperatures in the Arctic region,
which facilitate navigation, present a significant opportunity for the
liquefied natural gas industry, among other benefits, hence the
strategic importance of that area.

### Link---Shipping

#### Shipping routes in the Arctic are key to make shipping more profitable and China is already taking advantage of them

[Trump's]{.underline} recent [attention to the Arctic is]{.underline}
also connected to, and possibly primarily [focused on, the]{.underline}
growing [accessibility of the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest
Passage]{.underline}. These passages could offer increasingly accessible
and more lucrative Trans-Arctic shipping routes in comparison to the
Suez and Panama canals, especially, as mentioned above, climate change
accelerates. Estimates suggest that [in the future these routes could be
up to 33 percent more profitable than the Suez Canal, through the
reduction of shipping times and the circumvention of traditional
shipping checkpoints.]{.underline}

[Ongoing disruptions in global shipping]{.underline}, such as the Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea, as well as severe drought in Panama [have
highlighted vulnerabilities in traditional maritime chokepoints,
underscoring the impetus to find viable alternatives.]{.underline}
Russia and China are aggressively pursuing their Arctic ambitions.
Despite not being an Arctic nation, [China]{.underline} has stated its
ambitions of becoming a "near-Arctic" state and [is seeking to establish
a foothold in the region through its "Polar Silk Road"]{.underline}
initiative, [comprising an element of its broader Belt and Road
strategy]{.underline}. While in the near to medium term, these routes
remain commercially unviable due to operational challenges, the
long-term potential is significant. [As melting ice transforms global
shipping patterns, the region is rapidly becoming a potential key flash
point for economic confrontation between major powers.]{.underline}

On **[December 19 the United States government officially published maps
revealing expanded]{.underline} [territorial claims to a very large
continental shelf in the Arctic Sea,]{.underline}** the Atlantic, the
Bering Sea, the Pacific Ocean, in addition to two sections in the Gulf
of Mexico, and near the Mariana Islands, **[which]{.underline}
[represented a unilateral claim of sovereignty over approximately 1
million square kilometers of]{.underline} [seabed]{.underline}**. The
most significant implications of this territorial claim were in the
highly disputed and increasingly strategically important Arctic, where
Washington's claims would put it in control of tremendous quantities of
minerals and energy resources. Staking a claim to the Arctic though its
northernmost state of Alaska, the U.S. has been expanding its military
activities in the region for close to a decade, with the accession of
Finland and expected accession of Sweden to NATO ensuring that all
Arctic states other than Russia are part of the American-led alliance.
One of the most conspicuous signs of the prioritization being afforded
the region has been the deployment of over 100 fifth generation F 22 and
F-35 fighters to Alaska - which represents by far the largest
concentration of these still relatively scarce combat aircraft in any
one state or region**[. With tensions between the U.S. and Russia over
the]{.underline} [Arctic already remaining high, Moscow condemned
Washington's new unilateral claims as]{.underline} ["unacceptable," with
the head of the State Duma Committee on the Arctic, Nikolay
Kharitonov,]{.underline} [warning that U.S. attempts to expand the
region under its control risked increasing regional
tensions.]{.underline}**

[The expansion of American territorial claims closely follows a
statement by commander of the Russian]{.underline} [Navy Admiral
Nikolay]{.underline} Yevmenov in the first week of **[December that the
country faced a considerable]{.underline} [threat from the growing NATO
military presence in the region, stressing that "the collective West is
ramping up efforts to impede Russia's economic activities in the
Arctic."]{.underline}** Russia relies on the Arctic for approximately
one fifth of its Gross Domestic Product, and has invested heavily in
securing its expanding North Sea Route which has the potential to serve
as a new centre of maritime trade between East Asia and Europe. It has
received considerable Chinese support in doing so, with Chinese firms
playing important roles in improving regional infrastructure, as Beijing
itself retains a strong interest in the North Sea route as a safer
passageway for its trade than the Malacca Strait and Indian Ocean
dominated by Western navies. In parallel to major investments in
regional infrastructure, mining, oil exploration, and the construction
of by far the world's largest fleet of nuclear icebreakers, Russia from
the 2010s also significantly enhanced its armed forces' ability to
conduct operations in the region.

**[The US is attempting to turn the Arctic into an arena for
geo-political games]{.underline}**. In recent years**[, China
has]{.underline} [spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom and
strength to the development of the Arctic region. In]{.underline}
[contrast, the US has disrupted and sabotaged the peaceful and stable
environment of the Arctic]{.underline}**. On the one hand, the US is
striving to strengthen its \"presence\" in the Arctic region. In
September 2022, the US Department of Defense announced the establishment
of the Arctic Strategy and Global Resilience Office. In February 2023,
US President Joe Biden appointed the first Ambassador at Large for
Arctic Affairs of the US. On the other hand, the US has strengthened its
military deployment and hyped up the so-called \"Great Power
Competition\". The US Army established the 11th Airborne Division in
Alaska in 2022 and planned to establish a Multidomain Task Force (MDTF)
unit in the Arctic region. In 2021, the US Air Force temporarily
deployed four B-1B Lancers at Ørland Main Air Station in Norway. In
2022, it permanently deployed 54 F-35A Joint Strike Fighter jets at
Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. At present, the US has a substantial
capability for \"dynamic force employment\" within the Arctic Circle. In
addition, it has signed defense cooperation agreements with Finland,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and other countries. According to
these agreements, these Arctic states open multiple military bases to
the US, allowing the US forces easier access to the Arctic region.

**[The US is intensifying its presence in the Arctic for its own
interests.]{.underline}** Behind the frequent actions of the US is of
its greed for the growing strategic and economic value of the Arctic.
The continental and insular land territories in the Arctic cover an area
of about 8 million square kilometers, with sovereignty over them
belonging to Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden
and the US, respectively. With global warming in recent years, it has
become easier to develop sea routes, extract energy, and deploy military
forces in the Arctic. Consequently, the strategic value of the region
has become increasingly prominent.

[The looming ice-breaker race is not as spectacular as the
aircraft-carrier race, which is in full swing already]{.underline}. And
yet, [such a race]{.underline} is likely to have significant detrimental
implications for the future of the Arctic. It [might inadvertently lead
to more tensions and **even** to **direct conflicts**]{.underline},
particularly if it overlaps with enhanced military activities in the
region. One can mention, for instance, that in early 2024, NATO
conducted its Nordic Response exercises involving about 50 military
vessels, more than 110 aircraft, 20,000 servicemen from 14 countries.
Later, Canada announced that it was going to purchase 12 modern
submarines specifically designed to operate in the Arctic region.

[The **good news**, however, is that the **West** might have a **deficit
of material resources** and **political will** to **wage** a
**large-scale ice-breaker race** with **Moscow** and
**Beijing**.]{.underline} One can recall that the fuss about the US
lagging behind Russia and China in the Arctic region repeats itself
every couple of years. [The last ice-breaker fever took place
under]{.underline} former US president Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**.
There was much speculation about how Washington could bring its presence

Partly in response to all this activity, the United States is rebuilding
its own military capabilities in the region, which have atrophied since
the end of the Cold War. Besides tracking Russian submarines near the
GIUK gap, Washington has stepped up its strategic air patrols off the
coast of Siberia to probe Russian defense systems and gather other
intelligence. The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration also [plans to
build a **fleet of icebreakers** to **carry out** what it has
**referred** to as "**national** and **economic security**
**missions**"]{.underline} in the **[Arctic]{.underline}**.
[**Additional investments** will likely be necessary down
the]{.underline} line, both [to police **commercial activities** along
the **Alaskan coast** and throughout the U.S. **exclusive economic
zone**]{.underline} and to defend the country's commitment to freedom of
navigation in the polar region.

[Neither side's actions are **necessarily**]{.underline} [**aggressive**
in nature,]{.underline} nor do they portend an impending geopolitical
fight over who controls the region. In fact, Russia's military buildup
has taken place solely in areas where its legal authority is undisputed.
Submarine and aircraft activity near the GIUK gap and off the Alaskan
coast is a part of Russia's global strategy to deter potential military
attacks and not focused on the Arctic per se. Much the same is true of
U.S. actions in and around the region.

[At a time of **deepening distrust** between the United States and
Russia, however, the]{.underline} [danger is that **even actions** taken
for **legitimate security** **reasons** could spark **unnecessary
geopolitical tensions**]{.underline}. [**Hard-liners** in **both
countries**]{.underline}, [intent on **inflating** the **threat**, are
already painting a picture of the **Arctic** as a site of intense
**geopolitical competition**, and because the overall state of
U.S.-Russian relations is]{.underline} **[so dismal]{.underline}**,
[they are **gaining traction**]{.underline}. It is not difficult to
imagine an incident that would further reinforce their views. Russia,
for example, considers the Northern Sea Route to be within its
territorial waters, whereas the United States maintains that the passage
is in international waters. Should Washington insist on carrying out
freedom-of-navigation exercises there (as it did in May in the Barents
Sea, at the western end of the maritime route through Russian waters),
[a **standoff** with **Russia**, even a **military clash**, **might
ensue.**]{.underline}

left Russia [[effectively
"encircled"]{.underline}](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/)
by the alliance's members in the Arctic. This intensified its feelings
of vulnerability, as did the 2022 [[sabotage of the Nord Stream
pipelines]{.underline}](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/nordstream-172.html).
Although Russia [[had already halted gas
deliveries]{.underline}](https://www.rbc.ru/economics/02/09/2022/63122f949a7947dde66915e7)
through the pipelines, the attack exposed its inability to secure
critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. In 2024, a successful

above the Arctic Circle and home to Russia's strategic bomber
aircraft---dealt another blow to Kremlin confidence.

In parallel, [[Western
sanctions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions-against-russia-explained/)
targeting Russia's Arctic projects have intensified since
2022,]{.underline} with the 17th EU package

in May 2025. They have largely focused on a deep insecurity for Russia:
liquefied natural gas (LNG). But the Kremlin has little room for
manoeuvre against these measures. It [[has
promoted]{.underline}](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/07/04/zakryt-vorota)
projects like Arctic LNG 2 as replacements for lost pipeline gas exports
to Europe. But [Western countries [have imposed successive
sanctions](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/western-sanctions-on-icebreakers-stall-russias-arctic-lng-expansion/)
aimed at undermining the project's viability including blacklisting the
operating company, restricting access to LNG ice-class tankers and
targeting tanker operators.]{.underline} As a result, despite [[reported
efforts]{.underline}](https://arctida.io/ru/projects/How-Italian-Companies-Bypass-Sanctions-Against%20Russian-Gas)

the timeline for Arctic LNG 2 [[has repeatedly been

## Internal Link Debate

### Internal Link---Specific Escalation Scenarios

#### Internal Link---gray zone attacks in the Arctic are the most likely scenario for US-Russia nuclear escalation

**Matthew Wallin, CEO of American Security Project, May 12, 2025** ("Is
the Arctic Destined to be the Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear
War?"American Security Project, accessed at
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/HDCSW-AS)

**[Currently, the most likely path to a potential nuclear exchange in
the Arctic would be through a conventional or "gray zone" Russian attack
on a NATO member. Border skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace incursions,
reckless military intercepts, and support to separatist groups
intentionally sit in the "gray zone" between peace and outright war, but
could ultimately lead to open conflict that escalates to nuclear war.
Conceivably, a gray zone or overt attack on other Greelandic
infrastructure, or an [information operations
campaign](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/fact-sheet-russian-social-media-information-operations/) aimed
at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not outside of the
realm of possibility.]{.underline}**

[With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly,
Finland]{.underline}---which shares a [1,343 km border with
Russia](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/09/russia-finland-border-security?lang=en)---[there
is increased opportunity that a NATO Arctic state could be
attacked.]{.underline} Highlighting this risk, American forces in Alaska
recently staged a drill in which [hundreds of troops were flown to
Finland](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/world/europe/prepping-for-war-with-russia-at-36-degrees-below-zero.html?rsrc=flt&smid=em-share) to
defend against a mock Russian invasion. Yet rather than an overt
invasion of a NATO member, [Russia is far more likely test the waters by
conducting provocative and destabilizing small-scale gray zone
activities.]{.underline} The disastrous results of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about its ability to achieve
its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear armed country, let alone
a large NATO ally, making a direct attack unlikely. It is not entirely
clear where the red line on gray zone activities would be for Finland or
what would trigger an Article 5 collective defense declaration short of
a direct attack across the border.

#### Internal Link---Navigation issues in the Arctic could cause nuclear escalation---Russia or the US could disrupt navigation causing miscalculation and escalation---short time frame for war

**Wallin, CEO of American Security Project, May 12, 2025** (Matthew, "Is
the Arctic Destined to be the Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear
War?"American Security Project, accessed at
<https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/7/12/25>
HDCSW\--AS)

[Navigation issues in the Arctic could also lead to military escalations
reaching the nuclear level. The Global Navigation Satellite
System]{.underline} (GNSS), which includes satellite constellations like
the American GPS system or Russian GLONASS, [sees decreased reliability
and accuracy in the Arctic.]{.underline} The reasons for this are
abundant, like the orbital inclination of the satellites themselves and
ionospheric interference. [With [increased incidents of Russian GNSS
jamming in
Europe](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2025/03/12/eu-to-upgrade-gps-systems-as-russian-jamming-efforts-spark-response/),
it's conceivable that Russia may employ similar tactics in the Arctic,
including spoofing, for the purpose of disruption or causing
navigational errors to trigger an exploitable international incident.
Military or civilian vessels straying into Russian territory could be
captured, their cargoes seized, or crews held hostage for the purpose of
conducting hostage diplomacy. Resolving such a confrontation military
could quickly spiral out of control.\>]{.underline}

Some kind of [Russian military adventurism is another real possibility,
for example, in Spitzbergen. The 1920 Svalbard Treaty prohibits the use
of the islands for 'warlike purposes'. Nonetheless, in April 2016
Chechen special forces instructors landed in Svalbard before holding a
parachute exercise over the polar ice cap, and the Russian Zapad 2017
exercise included a simulated amphibious assault]{.underline}. [There
are two ready-made Russian bases: Pyramiden and
Barentsburg]{.underline}. I have visited both, and [Pyramiden in
particular looks very much like any military base]{.underline} --
barrack blocks, a parade square, huge gym and swimming pool, even a
chapel, all around a statue of Lenin. [Troops could move in tomorrow,
perhaps masquerading as 'maintenance troops']{.underline} (akin to the
'scrap metal merchants' who sparked off the Falklands War by occupying
South Georgia). [So Svalbard could well be a fairly obvious military
flashpoint]{.underline}.

[NATO simply cannot continue to ignore the massive and growing Russian
military presence in the Arctic]{.underline} and keep up the forlorn
hope of the Arctic being an area of low tension, of scientific
cooperation, a peaceful wilderness. [The prospect of Russian power being
projected from the High North into the North Atlantic is very real and a
comprehensive strategy is needed to meet the threat.]{.underline}

Putin's territorial interests extend beyond the Ukrainian border as it
also looks northward to secure its geopolitical dominance and future
security. **[The Arctic]{.underline}** Ocean, designated as a "vital"
ocean in Russia's Maritime Doctrine**[, is viewed as an essential
resource base to supplement Russia's dwindling]{.underline} [terrestrial
deposits]{.underline}**. It is believed to hold untapped reserves of
phosphate, bauxite, iron ore, copper, nickel, and diamonds. In December
2023, at a Navy forum, Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov, head of the Russian
Navy, reinforced this new doctrine by emphasizing [Russia's commitment
to the "full-scale]{.underline} [development" of the Arctic beyond its
200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, declaring the Arctic a]{.underline}
["strategic resource base" of significant economic
importance.]{.underline}

threatened. [Putin warns of "strategic competition" in the Arctic and

#### Internal---Arms Racing and militarization by Russia tensions are only accelerated by increased US presence in the Arctic

**Komin et al Hosa, writers for the European Council on Foreign
Relations (ECFR), 25** \[Mikhail et al Joanna, "The bear beneath the
ice: Russia's ambitions in the Arctic", ECFR, 5-27-25,

DOA: 7/14/25, HDCSW - J\$\]

[Russia's relations with Western countries in the Arctic have been
entangled in a "security dilemma" for over a decade: actions taken by
one state to enhance its security often lead to **countermeasures by
others, fuelling a cycle of tension and militarisation.**]{.underline}

[While the EU has focused more on a peaceful agenda related to climate
and Indigenous issues, the US and some NATO member states have been
developing their military capabilities in the Arctic in response to
similar actions by the Kremlin. For example, since 2022, the US expanded
NATO military exercises and infrastructure upgrades in Alaska, while
Norway has undertaken comparable efforts to bolster its Arctic defence
posture using its own military base. Such Western actions have only
increased Russia's perceived military insecurities.]{.underline}

[In particular, Russia's main military insecurity in the Arctic stems
from the Kremlin's nuclear deterrence strategy. A significant share of
Russia's nuclear arsenal is deployed on Arctic-based submarines, which
form the core of its second-strike capability. Russia's ability to
deploy these submarines in the northern seas while remaining undetected
by foreign forces is key to its nuclear deterrence strategy. As a
result, the Kremlin views Western reconnaissance, research and patrols
as potential threats aimed at detecting these assets.]{.underline}

[The alarming rate of Arctic ice melt in recent years has further
fuelled Russia's anxious reactions. The reduction in ice cover along
with the development of modern acoustic and radar methods can help
reveal previously hidden Russian submarines, increasing their
vulnerability. Ice melt also brings broader security concerns for the
Kremlin. As navigation becomes easier, Russia's vast northern coastline
is losing its natural defence barrier. Moscow increasingly fears this
may weaken its Northern Fleet's ability to deter a conventional Western
attack from the north, prompting further militarisation of the
region.]{.underline}

[As Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov told the press in September
2024, "Russia is fully ready for a conflict with NATO in the Arctic. We
see NATO stepping up drills related to possible crises in the
Arctic."]{.underline} [The Russian Northern Fleet spokesman said of
recent military exercises: "Current deployments are to rehearse
repelling military threats and ensure the security of sea lanes and
Russia's areas of maritime economic activity in the northern seas in the
event of a crisis]{.underline}." Or again, Russian defence minister
Sergei Shoygu explained the Northern fleet's strategic submarine base at
Gadzhiyevo which is roughly 100 miles from the Finnish border: "[Given
NATO's desire to build up military potential near Russia's borders as
well as to expand the Northern Atlantic Alliance at the expense of
Sweden and Finland, retaliatory measures are required to create an
appropriate grouping of troops in North West Russia]{.underline}."

Most recently [(in a speech on 27 March 2025 when he was in Murmansk to
launch the latest Yasen-M nuclear-powered submarine Perm]{.underline}),
President [Putin himself said that "the United States will continue to
advance its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in
the Arctic. Geopolitical competition and fighting for positions in this
region are also escalating]{.underline}." He expressed concerns "about
the fact that [NATO countries are increasingly often designating the Far
North as a springboard for possible conflicts]{.underline} and are
practicing the use of troops in these conditions. We will respond to all
this."

\"These countries could potentially field the alliance\'s military
infrastructure, including offensive weapons,\" [Gubin said, adding:
\"The increase of conflict potential in the Arctic, including due to the
intensification of operations of air forces and navies of the US, the UK
and other \[Nato\] members, warrants **a constant increase of the
military capabilities** of Russian Armed Forces formations]{.underline}
in the region.\"

Russia\'s main military asset is the Northern Fleet, headquartered in
Murmansk Region\'s Severomorsk. The fleet is considered to be Russia\'s
largest and most formidable naval force. The Northern Fleet fields both
conventional vessels and a strategic submarine fleet carrying most of
the Russian Navy\'s nuclear warheads.

Alongside its navy, Russia also maintains an array of land and air
forces, largely concentrated in and around the Kola Peninsula. In 2020,
[[Russia

the planet - the \"Arctic Shamrock\" base on the Alexandra Land island
of the Franz Josef Land archipelago. The base hosts up to 150
servicemen, including an air defence unit]{.underline}.

Speaking at the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk in March,
[[Vladimir Putin
promised](https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/b0003m62) that \"the
number of servicemen \[in the Arctic\] will grow]{.underline}\".

Some [officials and pro-Kremlin military figures have even suggested the
possibility of **direct military confrontation in response** to US and

Over the course of his presidency and prime ministership, Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}**---and the Russian elite more broadly---**[has
been guided in foreign policy matters by three principal imperatives.
The first is that]{.underline} [Russia must remain one of the
agenda-setting powers of the international system]{.underline}**. No one
in the Kremlin leadership trusts that an amorphous "international
community" somehow guided by a set of impartial "rules" will
benevolently and altruistically protect core Russian national interests.
As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov observed in a 2007
[speech]{.underline}, Russia's position "is never guaranteed in an
evolving international environment. We can preserve, as well as
increase, our achievements only through our active involvement in
international affairs." This means that Russia must be one of those
states that defines the global agenda.

This creates the second imperative**[: Putin and his team are adamant
that Russia must have the]{.underline} [ability to generate power and
project influence beyond its borders in order to shape an]{.underline}
[international environment favorable to the Kremlin's priorities. This
begins with being able to exercise]{.underline} [preponderant influence
over an extended Eurasian space using all the tools of
statecraft---that]{.underline} [Moscow, not]{.underline}** Brussels,
**[Washington,]{.underline}** or Beijing**[---should set the political,
economic and security agenda]{.underline} [of the region]{.underline}**.
In addition, a consistent demand over the course of Putin's tenure in
office has been that other countries in the region should not become
members of Western institutions of which Russia is also not a member.
**[The Kremlin worries about a future where its neighbors end up fully
integrated]{.underline} [into Euro-Atlantic structures---over which
Moscow has no influence or veto---leading to Russia's own]{.underline}
[marginalization and a direct threat to the maintenance of the Russian
position in Eurasia.]{.underline}**

Finally, the last imperative is to ensure that Russia can obtain the
necessary resources---both technological and financial---for economic
development and modernization. Indeed, as Iikka Korhonen and Heli Simola
argue in a 2022 [essay]{.underline} for Asian Economic Papers, "despite
its aspirations for greater economic self-sufficiency in recent years,
Russia still has substantial economic connections to the global economy
through international trade and financial markets"---especially for
capital goods, electronics, and critical technologies which are vital
both for its domestic industries (including energy extraction) as well
as its military-industrial complex. Thus, as a 2018 Jamestown Foundation
[analysis]{.underline} concluded, **["Russia's strategy pursues both a
global power objective and a domestic economic
objective."]{.underline}**

Germany's early invasion of Norway was driven by the need to secure
Swedish iron ore, transported via Norwegian ports. Coal and Iron ore
compelled the Japan's invasion of Manchuria. In the case of Pearl
Harbor, the immediate trigger for Japan's attack on the United States
was the American oil embargo, which threatened to cripple Japan's
military. The British safeguarded oil fields in Iran and Iraq, which
were essential for maintaining Allied fuel supplies. Similarly, **[oil

## Terminal Impact Debate

### Impact---Arms Racing 

#### Impact\--Increasing regional tensions with Russia in the Arctic would lead to a frantic arms racing 

**Tierokhin, student researcher, 23** \[Bohdan, "Russia\'s Perception of
NATO Enlargement and the Challenges to its Great Power Identity",

accessed July 15, HDCSW - EO\]

It is also necessary to consider **[NATO, which emerged from the
aftermath of World War II primarily]{.underline} [under the leadership
of the United States and the United Kingdom. NATO, initially formed as
a]{.underline} [collective security alliance to counter Soviet
influence, evolved into a key pillar of Western military]{.underline}
[and political power]{.underline}**. Following **[the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Russia's status as a Great Power was]{.underline} [called
into question, even within Russia itself. The dissolution of the Soviet
Union resulted in the loss]{.underline} [of vast territories, spheres of
influence, and geopolitical leverage, leading to an identity crisis
in]{.underline} [Russian foreign policy.]{.underline}** This period of
uncertainty was further exacerbated by rapid advancements in military
technology, particularly in the air domain.

**[The Gulf War of 1991]{.underline}** was a stark demonstration of
Western military superiority. The United States and its allies, using
precision-guided munitions, stealth technology, and advanced air power,
quickly dismantled Iraqi forces in a manner that caught Russian military
strategists by surprise. This technological gap not only highlighted
Russia's lag in modern warfare but also signalled a shifting balance of
power that further marginalized Russia's global standing. The war's
**[outcome reinforced]{.underline} [Russia\'s insecurity about its
declining military and technological capabilities in a world where
the]{.underline} [United States seemed to dominate militarily and
economically.]{.underline}**

**[Adding to this erosion of Russia's influence was the U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq in 2003, which further]{.underline} [deepened Russian
grievances.]{.underline}** The decision to bypass the United Nations
Security Council, where Russia held veto power, was perceived in Moscow
as a blatant disregard for international law and a sign of Western
unilateralism. Russia, which saw itself as a guardian of international
norms through its role in the Security Council, felt sidelined and
disrespected on the global stage. This disregard for Russia's role in
global governance stoked fears that the West, particularly NATO, was
willing to act independently of Russia\'s influence, diminishing its
ability to shape global security dynamics.

**[The eastward expansion of NATO has been a concern for
Russia]{.underline}**, but its deeper grievance lies in the loss of its
empire and Great Power status after the Soviet Union\'s collapse. **[For
Putin, this loss of]{.underline} [influence in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia was seen as a geopolitical disaster, with each
NATO]{.underline} [expansion reminding them of their diminished
standing]{.underline}**. Actions like claiming the Sea of Azov and
annexing Crimea were framed as restoring former imperial territories,
helping to heal the post-Soviet identity crisis. As Putin remarked, 'As
for the results of the special military operation, some of them may
manifest themselves only after a long while. New territories have
appeared. This is a significant result for Russia. These are serious
questions. Take the Sea of Azov, which has become Russia's inland sea.
That's very serious.' This rhetoric underscores the symbolic and
strategic significance of such territorial

gains for Russia, reinforcing its efforts to reclaim its Great Power
identity through the recovery of key geopolitical assets.

**[The 2014 invasion of Ukraine and war in Donbass were not just about
stopping NATO but reasserting]{.underline} [control over a region Russia
sees as vital to its sphere of influence]{.underline}**. Crimea's
annexation was less about NATO missiles and more about restoring
Russia's image as a dominant regional power. The full-scale invasion of
Ukraine in 2022 revealed even more about Russia\'s intentions. While
NATO's eastward expansion had long been a point of tension, the invasion
highlighted Moscow's broader goals of reasserting control over Ukraine
and re-establishing dominance in the post-Soviet space. Russia's
response to Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO further clarified
this dynamic. Putin's statement that Russia has no territorial disputes
with Finland or Sweden, unlike Ukraine, was telling. It underscored the
fact that Russia's aggression towards Ukraine is deeply tied to
historical claims and its desire to keep Ukraine in its orbit, rather
than an inherent fear of NATO's military presence. The redeployment of
80% of Russian troops from the Finnish border to Ukraine, even as
Finland was formally accepted into NATO, also dispels the notion that
Russia's actions are primarily driven by fear of NATO.

**[If NATO posed such a grave threat to Russian security, one would
expect Moscow to reinforce its]{.underline} [borders]{.underline}** with
newly accepted members. Instead, the Kremlin prioritized the war in
Ukraine, further emphasising that the conflict is not about NATO
expansion alone, but about Russia's need to assert control over Ukraine,
restore its influence, and preserve the remnants of its Great Power
identity.

The dangers of arms races are well-established by history. Throughout
**[the late 1950s, American]{.underline} [policymakers began to fear
that the Soviet Union was outpacing the U.S. in deployment of nuclear
capable missiles. This ostensible "missile gap" pushed the U.S. to scale
up its ballistic missile]{.underline} [development to "catch up" to the
Soviets.]{.underline}**

The reality of such a purported "AI gap" is complicated. Beijing does
appear to lead the U.S. in military AI innovation. China also leads the
world in AI academic journal citations and commands a formidable talent
base. However, when it comes to the pursuit of AGI, China seems to be
the laggard. Chinese companies' LLMs are 1-3 years behind their American
counterparts, and OpenAI set the pace for generative models.
Furthermore, the Biden administration's 2022 export controls on advanced
computer chips cut China off from a key hardware prerequisite for
building advanced AI.

The problem with such deployment is that, while humans can program AI to
pursue a chosen ultimate end, it is infeasible that each instrumental,
or intermediate, subgoal that the AI will pursue --- think acquiring
steel before it can make paperclips --- can be defined by humans.

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
nuclear war between the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and **Russia**]{.underline}, despite horrific casualties, [neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the
direct effects of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The
aftermath could be **much worse**]{.underline}: the
[burning]{.underline} of [flammable materials could send massive amounts
of smoke into the atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight
and cause sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural
disruption -- **[a nuclear winter]{.underline}**. According to one model
9 , [an all-out exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to
a drop in global temperatures of around 8°C, making it **impossible to
grow food for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave some
survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but they
would be in a very precarious situation and the **threat of extinction**
from other sources **would be great**. An exchange on this scale is
**only possible**]{.underline} [**between the US and Russia** who have
more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with
stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each, although many are not
operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that even [a small
regional nuclear war involving 100 nuclear weapons would]{.underline}
produce a nuclear winter serious enough to [put two billion]{.underline}
people [at risk]{.underline} of starvation,12 [though this]{.underline}
estimate **[might be pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale
are **unlikely to lead to**]{.underline} outright **[human
extinction]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts which
are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns. [It
is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
**existential risk from nuclear war**]{.underline} over the next
century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence intervals.
According to many experts, [the most likely nuclear war]{.underline} at
present [is between India and Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given
the relatively modest size of their arsenals, the risk of human
extinction is **plausibly greater** from a conflict between the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**Russia**]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have increased
in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the possibility of
them rising further in the future.

### Russia\-\--Impact\-\--Relations Good

#### US-Russia relations solve [nuclear war]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON --- It [has the makings of a new Cold War, or
worse.]{.underline} The [**deep chill in U.S.-Russian relations** is
stirring concern in some quarters that Washington and Moscow are in
danger of stumbling into an **armed confrontation that, by mistake or
miscalculation, could lead to nuclear war**]{.underline}. American and
European analysts and current and former U.S. military officers say the
[nuclear superpowers **need to talk more**]{.underline}. A foundational
[arms control agreement is being
abandoned](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/02/13/nato-is-getting-ready-for-a-russia-with-a-lot-more-missiles/)
and the last major limitation on strategic nuclear weapons could go away
in less than two years. Unlike during the Cold War, when generations
lived under threat of a nuclear Armageddon, the two militaries are
barely on speaking terms. \"[During the Cold War, we understood each
other\'s signals. We talked]{.underline},\" says the top NATO commander
in Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is about to retire.
\"I\'m concerned that we don\'t know them as well today.\" Scaparrotti,
in his role as [Supreme Allied Commander
Europe](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/03/05/top-us-general-seeks-more-troops-warships-in-europe-to-counter-russia/),
has met only twice with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian
general staff, but has spoken to him by phone a number of other times.
\"I personally think [communication is a very **important part of
deterrence**]{.underline},\" Scaparrotti said, referring to the idea
that adversaries who know each other\'s capabilities and intentions are
less likely to fall into conflict. \"So, I think [we should have more
communication with Russia]{.underline}. It [would ensure that we
understand each other and why we are doing what we\'re
doing]{.underline}.\" He added: \"It doesn\'t have to be a lot.\" The
United States and Russia, which together control more than 90 percent of
the world\'s nuclear weapons, say that in August they will leave the
1987 treaty that banned an entire class of nuclear weapons. And there
appears to be little prospect of extending the 2010 New
[Start](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/04/14/the-chill-in-us-russia-relations-has-some-worried-about-stumbling-into-a-military-conflict/)
treaty that limits each side\'s strategic nuclear weapons. After a
period of post-Cold War cooperation on nuclear security and other
defense issues, [the relationship between Washington and Moscow took a
nosedive]{.underline}, particularly [after Russian forces entered the
former Soviet republic of Georgia]{.underline} in 2008. Tensions spiked
with Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and its [military
intervention in eastern
Ukraine](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/26/russias-conflict-with-ukraine-an-explainer/).
In response, Congress in 2016 severely limited military cooperation with
Russia. The law prohibits \"military-to-military cooperation\" until the
secretary of defense certifies that Russia \"has ceased its occupation
of Ukrainian territory\" and \"aggressive activities.\" The law was
amended last year to state that it does not limit military talks aimed
at \"reducing the risk of conflict.\" [Relations frayed even further
amid U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election]{.underline}, although President Donald Trump has
doubted Russian complicity in what U.S. intelligence agencies assert was
an effort by Moscow to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House.
After a [Helsinki summit with
Putin](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/07/18/trump-backs-down-under-fire-clarifies-on-russia-meddling/)
in July, Trump publicly accepted the Kremlin leader's denial of
interference. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said in an interview Friday that Russian behavior is to blame
for the strained relationship. \"It\'s very difficult for us to have
normal relationships with a country that has not behaved normally over
the last few years,\" Dunford said. \"There are [major issues that
affect our bilateral relationship that have to be
addressed]{.underline}, to include where Russia has violated
international laws, norms and standards.\" Dunford said he speaks
regularly with Gerasimov, his Russian counterpart, and the two sides
talk on other levels. \"I\'m [satisfied right now with our
military-to-military communication to **maintain a degree of
transparency** that **mitigates the risk of
miscalculation**]{.underline},\" he said. \"I think we have a framework
within to manage a crisis, should one occur, at the senior
military-to-military level.\" James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral
who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013, says the
West must confront Russia where necessary, including on its
interventions in Ukraine and Syria. But he believes there room for
cooperation on multiple fronts, including [the
Arctic](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/04/04/with-missiles-pointing-out-to-sea-northern-clover-stakes-russian-claim-on-arctic-waters/)
and arms control. \"We are **[in danger of stumbling backward into a
Cold War that is to no one\'s advantage]{.underline}**,\" he said in an
[email](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/04/14/the-chill-in-us-russia-relations-has-some-worried-about-stumbling-into-a-military-conflict/)
exchange. \"Without steady, political-level engagement between the
defense establishments, the risk of a true new Cold War rises
steadily.\" No one is predicting a deliberate Russian act of war in
Europe, but [the decline in regular talks is a worry to
many.]{.underline} Moscow says it is ready to talk. \"[**Russia remains
open** for interaction aimed at de-escalating tension, **restoring
mutual trust**, **preventing any misinterpretations** of one another\'s
intentions, and **reducing the risk of dangerous
incidents**]{.underline},\" the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
in a statement last week in response to NATO\'s 70th anniversary
celebration. Sam Nunn, who served in the Senate as a Democrat from
Georgia from 1972 to 1997, argues that dialogue with Russia is too
important to set aside, even if it carries domestic political risk.
\"You can\'t call time out,\" he said in an interview. \"[The nuclear
issues go on, and they\'re getting more dangerous]{.underline}.\" Nunn
co-wrote an opinion piece with former Secretary of State George Shultz
and former Defense Secretary William Perry arguing that the [U.S. and
its allies and Russia are caught in a \"policy incapacity
~~paralysis~~\" that could lead to a military confrontation and
potentially the first use of nuclear weapons since the U.S. bombed Japan
in August 1945.]{.underline} \"A bold policy shift is needed,\" they
wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, \"to support a strategic
re-engagement with Russia and walk back from this perilous precipice.
Otherwise, our nations may soon be entrenched in a nuclear standoff more
precarious, disorienting and economically costly than the Cold War.\" A
group of U.S., Canadian, European and Russian security experts and
former officials in February issued a call for talks with Russia on
crisis management. \"The [**risks of mutual misunderstanding** and
**unintended signals that stem from an absence of dialogue** relating to
crisis management]{.underline} \... are real,\" the Euro-Atlantic
Security Leadership Group said in a statement. It said this [could lead
to conventional war with Russia or, in a worst-case
scenario]{.underline}, "the **[potential for nuclear threats, or even
nuclear use, where millions could be killed in minutes]{.underline}**."

The bear in the room

[When it comes to dealing with the **potential disease** **dangers**
emanating from a **warming Arctic**]{.underline}, [there is a **giant
bear** in the **room**]{.underline}. Many [researchers are frustrated
because they **cannot get data** or **cooperation out of
Russia**]{.underline}. Romanovsky, a Russian native, was formerly
affiliated with Moscow State University, but he can no longer do
research in Russia, he says ruefully, because he gave an interview to a
radio program considered "undesirable" and could be sentenced to five
years in a Russian prison for it.

[**Knowledge of public health** in the **Russian Arctic has
atrophied**]{.underline}. Russia aims to extract resources, ignoring
economic constraints and disregarding international environmental and
public health codes, Romanovsky says. [It]{.underline} [may be the most
important region to monitor, but also remains the **least likely** to be
**monitored** or share its **data internationally**.]{.underline}
[Russia's willful isolation affects every aspect of climate change in
the Arctic, including its potential role in **pathogens'** **evolution**
and **migration**.]{.underline}

[The lack of plentiful and **robust data** means that it is **almost
impossible** to attach a **realistic probability** of risk to the
**possible emergence** of **Arctic pathogens**]{.underline}. But we know
that human activity---development, shipping, extraction,
hunting---creates favorable conditions for microbial spread and
evolution, and we know the Arctic is entering a phase in which human
activities are expanding. The world can't afford to allow uncertainty,
lack of data, and disciplinary siloes to obscure the range of possible
ways microbes will behave in the altered Arctic that is shaping up. They
are the most resilient entities on our planet, after all.

### Impact---Nuclear War Outweighs Climate Change

#### Nuclear war is a bigger threat to humanity than climate change

**Gayle, environment correspondent for the Guardian, '25**

\[Damien, "Why nuclear war, not the climate crisis, is humanity's
biggest threat, according to one author", The Guardian, 6/15/25,
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/why-nuclear-war-not-the-climate-crisis-is-humanitys-biggest-threat-according-to-one-author>,
7/11/25 HDCSW SG\]

[Climate breakdown is usually held]{.underline} up [as the biggest, most
urgent threat humans pose]{.underline} to the future of the planet
today.

[But]{.underline} what if there was another, greater, human-made threat
that could snuff out not only human civilisation, but practically the
entire biosphere, in the blink of an eye?

As you read this, about 4,000 [nuclear weapons are]{.underline} poised
for a first strike across the northern hemisphere, enough atomic
firepower to kill as many as 700 million people from blasts and burning
alone.

And that is just the start. The explosions and fires -- [like nothing
seen on Earth since the comet strike that led to the Cretaceous mass
extinction]{.underline} [-- would loft enough soot into the stratosphere
to cast an impenetrable shadow over the globe. No light means no
photosynthesis, the basis of planetary foodwebs. No heat means that the
surface of the Earth would plunge into an icy, years-long
winter.]{.underline}

That is the message of Mark Lynas, a British writer who for two decades
has worked to help people understand the science of climate breakdown
while pushing for action on carbon emissions. But after three years of
research for a new book, published last month, he now sees nuclear war
as an even greater threat.

"[There's no adaptation options for nuclear war]{.underline}," Lynas
said. "[Nuclear winter will kill virtually the entire human
population.]{.underline} And there's nothing you can do to prepare, and
[there's nothing you can do to adapt]{.underline} when it happens,
[because it happens over the space of hours.]{.underline}

"[It is a vastly more catastrophic, existential risk than climate
change]{.underline}."

"[The burning of the cities is the mechanism that causes nuclear
winter]{.underline}," Lynas said. "[You get soot that's lofted
through]{.underline} pyrocumulonimbus [clouds]{.underline} -- big,
fire-generated thunder clouds -- [which pump \[it]{.underline}\], like a
chimney, [into the stratosphere]{.underline}.

"[Once it gets]{.underline} above the tropopause, [into the
stratosphere, it can't be rained out.]{.underline} And [because it's
dark coloured, it catches the sun, heats up and gets higher and
higher.]{.underline} It gets probably totally dark at the surface for
weeks, if not months."

A deactivated Titan II nuclear missile in a silo in Arizona.

A new nuclear arms race is beginning. It will be far more dangerous than
the last one.

[The temperature rapidly drops below freezing. And it stays there, for
years]{.underline}. "There's never another harvest for humanity. [The
food will never grow again]{.underline}. Because [by the time the sun
comes back out]{.underline} and temperatures rise again, within a decade
or so, [everyone's dead.]{.underline}"

### A2: No US-Russia Nuclear War

#### Nuclear war is likely and has high potential for error

**Gayle, environment correspondent for the Guardian, '25**

\[Damien, "Why nuclear war, not the climate crisis, is humanity's
biggest threat, according to one author", The Guardian, 6/15/25,
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/why-nuclear-war-not-the-climate-crisis-is-humanitys-biggest-threat-according-to-one-author>,
7/10/25 HDCSW - SG\]

[How likely is this scenario?]{.underline} Surely no one could be so
reckless as to start a nuclear war? Actually, says Lynas, they could.
[After all, the US did use nuclear weapons against civilians in
Japan]{.underline} in 1945, [and]{.underline} since then [there have
been numerous moments when the world stood minutes from
nuc]{.underline}lear [war]{.underline}, whether by accident or
brinkmanship. Today, both [the US and Russia have]{.underline} espoused
[first-strike doctrines that threaten the use of nuclear weapons even
against conventional attacks]{.underline} (China, notably, has a policy
of "no first use").

Meanwhile, [nuclear weapons continue to proliferate. The US and Russia
hold]{.underline} the biggest arsenals, with about [12,000 between
them]{.underline}. [China is racing to catch up]{.underline}, with an
estimated 500 as of 2024. Also armed are Britain, France, Israel, India,
Pakistan and North Korea, with Iran apparently on the cusp developing
its own weapon -- a step that onlookers fear it may be more likely to
take after last week's attacks by Israel.

And [the potential for error is also high. If US early warning systems
went off, its nuclear doctrine would give]{.underline} Donald [Trump six
minutes to decide whether it was a glitch (which has happened) or to
respond in kind. Russia is said to have a "dead hand" system that would
launch ballistic missiles automatically]{.underline} [in the event its
own command and control structures were disabled.]{.underline}

#### Great Power conflict will lead to continuous and brutal war 

**Shapiro, Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton
University, and Collins, PhD in Public and International Affairs, '24**

\[Jacob and Liam, "Great Power Competition Will Drive Irregular
Conflicts", War on the Rocks, 4/8/24,
<https://warontherocks.com/2024/04/great-power-competition-will-drive-irregular-conflicts/>
7/14/25 SG\]

Cold War-era conflicts involving a great power on one or both sides were
vastly more intense. [At least two thirds of battle deaths in the second
half of the Cold War came in conflicts with two or more great powers
involved.]{.underline} If past is prologue, we can anticipate that the
consequences of similar "[small wars" today will be anything but modest
and likely worse]{.underline} because the great-power competition
provides strong incentives for reciprocal interventions.

One way to see how much worse wars with two great powers involved can be
is to notice that while the 26 conflicts with two or more great powers
supporting combatants represent less than one quarter of irregular
conflicts [active from 1975 to 1991, they caused 64 to 70 percent of the
battle deaths during this period]{.underline}. Exceptionally violent
conflicts happened around the world, from Afghanistan and Ethiopia to
Cambodia and El Salvador. But all shared some common traits: they lasted
for more than a decade, one great power supported the government and one
supported at least one rebel faction (often more), and most settled
shortly after the end of the Cold War when support to at least one side
dried up. What this all implies is that [in a world with competing great
powers we should expect there to be multiple extended, brutal conflicts
for which irregular warfare competency will be critical.]{.underline}
This is a world we are sadly already living in.

### A2: Russia will never use Nuclear weapons

#### Russia is willing to use nukes against conventional attacks and attacks by states that are allies with a nuclear state

**Paul, Senior Policy Fellow, '24**

\[Rishi, "Bluff and bluster: Why Putin revised Russia's nuclear
doctrine", European Leadership Network, 11/25/24,
<https://europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/bluff-and-bluster-why-putin-revised-russias-nuclear-doctrine/>,
7/14/25 HDCSW - SG\]

On 24th September 2024, Russian President Vladimir [Putin
announced]{.underline} significant [updates to Russia's nuclear
doctrine]{.underline} in response to what Moscow perceives as increased
Western interference in Ukraine. A few months later, on Tuesday 19th
November, Putin formalised the changes as official policy of the Russian
Federation. [The]{.underline} revised [doctrine]{.underline},
titled "Fundamentals of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the
Field of Nuclear Deterrence", N°991,[ expands Russia's conditions for
nuclear weapon use. Moscow is now prepared to use nuclear weapons in
retaliation to nuclear attacks, as well as conventional attacks that
threaten the sovereignty or territorial integrity of Russia]{.underline}
or Belarus. The policy shift from the 2020 doctrine is evident, as the
previous stance also allowed for a nuclear response to conventional
weapon attacks, but only under circumstances where "the very existence
of the state is threatened." Notably, the policy explicitly extends
Russia's nuclear protection to Belarus, framing this as a commitment
under the Union State agreement between the two nations. In 1999, Moscow
and Minsk signed the Union State treaty, which outlined cooperation
across various areas, including defence, while preserving the
independence of both nations. Moscow's extended deterrence guarantee to
Belarus is logical, given that Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko
had permitted Russian-controlled tactical nuclear weapons to be
stationed in Belarus, a move that was downplayed by some in the West as
"purely a political message". In addition, Paragraph 10 of the revised
doctrine states that: "[The aggression by any state from a military
coalition]{.underline} (bloc, alliance) [against the Russian Federation
and (or) its allies shall be considered as aggression by this
coalition]{.underline} (bloc, alliance) as a whole". This line tacitly
references NATO, emphasising that any aggression against Russia by a
member of a military bloc or coalition is seen as aggression by the
entire bloc. Furthermore, Paragraph 11 specifies that:
"[Aggression]{.underline} against the Russian Federation and (or) its
allies [by any non-nuclear state with the participation or support of a
nuclear state shall be considered as their joint attack]{.underline}".
According to the doctrine, this qualifies as grounds for nuclear
retaliation. However, it remains unclear whom such retaliation would
target.

### A2: Nuclear Weapons deter arctic conflict

#### Ans to Nuclear Weapons deter conflict in the Arctic---Doubts on US deterrence, UK and France nuclear expansion and Chinese presence in the Arctic means no deterrence

**Matthew Wallin, CEO of American Security Project, May 12, 2025** "Is
the Arctic Destined to be the Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear
War?"American Security Project, accessed at
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/

\<Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter
a Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing [doubt about his willingness to defend
a NATO
member](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-nato-alliance-us-security-support) that
comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe about America's
commitment. As a result, France and the UK are considering expanding
their arsenals, signifying an increased reliance on nuclear posturing
for deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic NATO members. France
is [reconsidering whether it wants to decommission its current
warheads](https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/la-france-envisage-d-augmenter-son-arsenal-nucleaire-03-04-2025-2586448_20.php#11) as
it brings replacements online, potentially doubling of the size of its
arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an airbase closer to the German
border to be able to [host nuclear
weapons](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-will-reopen-fourth-nuclear-air-base/).
The UK, which has been historically dependent on the U.S. for its
nuclear arsenal, is recently [questioning that
dependence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/08/us-support-uk-nuclear-arsenal-in-doubt-trident-france),
and may seek other options to assure an effective and reliable
deterrent. This could foretell a new nuclear arms race.

The upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the [last remaining
strategic nuclear arms
treaty](https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-it-is-hard-imagine-talks-with-us-new-nuclear-arms-reduction-treaty-2025-04-08/) between
the U.S. and Russia, portends a period of nuclear proliferation that
could echo the nuclear arms buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, China,
which has been operating in the Arctic, has been engaging in its own
rapid nuclear buildup in an effort to potentially exceed [1,000 warheads
by
2035](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2025-01/news/pentagon-says-chinese-nuclear-arsenal-still-growing).
China has consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral nuclear
arms reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its
comparatively [much smaller nuclear
arsenal](https://apnews.com/article/8bf9a3bf29883a866545c50d94d5f445).\>

stakeholder in the North, but its interests are confined mostly to
potential energy and other resource exploration as well as
transportation and wild-life preservation.

**[Russia]{.underline}** [began reinvesting in **Arctic affairs in the
mid-2000s**]{.underline}.9 [The Kremlin remains adamant in asserting
complete control over the **Arctic Zone** of the **Russian Federation**
(AZRF),]{.underline} extending defense in depth through interdiction
capabilities away from the Russian Arctic, and protecting perceived
vital interests along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Russia has been
rapidly militarizing NSR approaches, especially across critical choke
points,10 and modernizing local infrastructure.11

Under the impact of climate change, more waters and coastlines in and
close to the AZRF and the NSR are becoming accessible. [In Moscow's
calculations, receding sea ice coverage means that the once
"**natural**" border no **longer offers** sufficient **protection**. The
Kremlin consequently **fears** that the **US and NATO**]{.underline}
[will soon **increase**]{.underline} surface, subsurface, and air
**[deployments]{.underline}** [closer to the **AZRF**. This situation is
**fraught** with **miscalculation** and **tactical errors** that could
lead to **dangerous escalation** with **global
consequences**.]{.underline}

[This fear has been **amplified** by **Sweden's** and **Finland's NATO
accession**, fueling a sense of **encirclement**]{.underline}12 and

air base,14 home to strategic aviation assets, in July 2024, raises the
question of how potent Russia's multilayered defense capabilities truly
are.

[The growing **military ambitions** of the **Russian
Federation**]{.underline} -- and, to a degree, China's ambitions as well
-- [have generated **substantial insecurity** regarding future
**developments**, and thus created a **security
dilemma**]{.underline}.¹⁶³ As an example, in its most recent strategy
paper of November 2020, Sweden identified a "new military dynamic in the
Arctic region."¹⁶⁴ Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist explained
that an "armed attack on Sweden \[...\] could not be excluded," thereby
justifying his country's military rearmament. From 2021 to 2025 defence
spending will rise by 40 percent, and even by 85 percent compared to
2014 levels.¹⁶⁵ [Amidst security dilemmas, insecure countries typically
**react** by feeling **obliged** to **strengthen their military
capabilities.**]{.underline} [This creates a **spiral of competition for
power** and ultimately leads to a **reduction**, **rather** than
**increase**,]{.underline} [in the **security** of all **involved
actors**]{.underline}.¹⁶⁶ The US and other NATO members have already
given partial responses to the question of how to react to Russia's
increased engagement in the Arctic-North Atlantic region. However, [the
measures they have applied]{.underline} -- **[namely]{.underline}**
rearmament, exercises, and [redeployment]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
operational **[resources]{.underline}** -- must be embedded in a
well-balanced combination of deterrence, defence, and dialogue.

Conflict Prevention through Dialogue and Cooperation

[As **activities**]{.underline} [and **competition** for **access to**
and **influence** in the **Arctic increase**]{.underline}, [so the need
for mechanisms also grows that can overcome tensions, maintain dialogue,
and **improve cooperation**]{.underline}. [Without such a framework,
there is a risk that a **misunderstanding** or **misperception**
following an **accident** could **escalate** into an **unintended armed
conflict**. It is therefore essential for **Arctic countries** to
conduct a **dialogue** on **issues** of **military
security**.]{.underline} If this exchange is then institutionalised, it
is more likely that the intentions behind individual states' Arctic
security policy become more transparent. [Ideally, this would defuse the
security dilemma for all those involved, slow down the build-up of
military capacities, and create the foundations for a future security
architecture.]{.underline}

### China Not Arctic Threat

#### China not a threat---Arctic resource boon is overestimated and melting ice expose China vulnerabilities.

**Hopwood-Phillips, a writer focused on China and founder of a political
consultancy, '24**

\[Henry, "Don't overestimate China's ambitions in the Arctic", The

Many [western analysts have failed to accurately calibrate the scale of
the Arctic's economic opportunities, another reason for their
overestimation of China's growing power in the region.]{.underline}
[They depict the Arctic as providing a shorter shipping route than Suez
and a treasure chest of resources]{.underline}, including oil, natural
gas, fisheries and critical minerals.

[In reality]{.underline}, developing [a reliable route to rival the Suez
Canal remains implausible due to safety concerns, environmental
uncertainties, lack of infrastructure and shortness of]{.underline} the
[navigation]{.underline} season. Currently, [less than 10 percent of
global shipping movement is in the Arctic and]{.underline} that [looks
[unlikely to increase in the near
term](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920923001281).]{.underline}

The idea that there will be a scramble for the Arctic's natural
resources in which China plays a major part is also overblown.
Ostensibly, the opportunities in the region look promising: according to
a US Geological Survey, the Arctic
[holds](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1169467) an
estimated 13 percent of the world's undiscovered conventional oil
resources and 30 percent of its undiscovered conventional natural gas
resources. But most is in exclusive economic zones. In fact, under the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, [[six]{.underline}
littoral
[states]{.underline}](https://www.cna.org/archive/CNA_Files/pdf/cop-2017-u-015944-1rev.pdf)
[control]{.underline} roughly [85 percent of the water]{.underline}
space, [which includes the resources]{.underline} in the seabed.
Moreover, [Beijing cannot challenge the sovereign rights of Arctic
states]{.underline} over maritime jurisdictions without contradicting
its own efforts to nationalise the East and South China Seas, where its
stakes are much higher.

Finally, [a thaw in the Arctic will pose new challenges for
China]{.underline} and other nations. The instability of [softening
terrain will make it difficult to build the infrastructure necessary for
extracting resources]{.underline}. The changing landscape [may also
undermine the role of existing military structures such as roads,
runways, naval bases and communications systems]{.underline}. It may
even destabilise military strategies, as thinning ice and increased
satellite coverage make submarines more exposed.

#### China's threat and in the Arctic is overestimated---there are many factors that limit the efficiency/danger of China's increased presence in the region

[The idea that there will be a scramble for the Arctic's natural
resources in which China plays a major part is also
overblown.]{.underline} Ostensibly[, the opportunities in the region
look promising: according to a US Geological Survey, the Arctic
[holds](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1169467) an

existing military structures such as roads, runways, naval bases and
communications systems. It may even destabilise military strategies, as
thinning ice and increased satellite coverage make submarines more
exposed.]{.underline}

In sum[, China's potential in the Arctic is limited by Russia's concerns
of rivalry in the sole region where it remains a first-rank power,
especially as the power gap between the two countries widens in other
fields. Beijing has decided to respect Russia's sensitivities and
prioritise the pursuit of a shared revisionist world order, resulting in
an adjustment of its ambitions in the Arctic. Western analysts should
take heed or risk wasting resources in the Far North that might be
better deployed elsewhere.]{.underline}

"[States from outside the Arctic region do not have territorial

#### China arctic threat is overstated\--Russia-China collaboration in the Arctic is overhyped

**Hopwood-Phillips, a writer focused on China and founder of a political
consultanty, '24**

\[Henry, "Don't overestimate China's ambitions in the Arctic", The
Strategist, 5/9/24,
<https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/dont-overestimate-chinas-ambitions-in-the-arctic/>,
7/15/25 HDCSW - SG\]

Western analysts risk overestimating China's emergence as an Arctic
power, spurred by fears that they initially neglected the reappearance
of the Arctic as a theatre for strategic competition. Contrary to such
alarmist views, [Beijing is in fact far more constrained in the
region]{.underline}, mainly because of Russia's ability to resist
encroachment and China's ability to accept limited resource and transit
opportunities there.

In assessing China's influence over Russia in the Arctic, there is a
tendency to portray Russia as little more than a springboard for Chinese
interests. In this flawed perception, President Vladimir Putin has
invited Beijing into his Arctic larder as a way of buying goodwill for
his invasion of Ukraine. But this underestimates Moscow, which assumes
its alliance with China will hold without such bargaining.
[Russia]{.underline} also [jealously guards its backyard and signals
that regional advances made by China would injure their alignment
elsewhere in locations with far greater strategic
importance]{.underline} for Beijing.

To this end, Putin has stalled projects that fail to further his
strategic agenda or give him a controlling stake. Russian law stipulates
that, while private Russian energy firms can develop in the Arctic zone,
they may not cede controlling stakes to foreign firms. Furthermore,
[Russia has not given China]{.underline} privileged [use of the North
Sea Route or its six major port]{.underline}s---Pevek, Tiksi, Dikson,
Sabetta, Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. Chinese ships have either been
refused entry or have abided by Russian transit laws that force them to
pay tolls, provide ample notice about journeys and accept Russian
pilots.

#### No shunning of China\--The U.S. has been undermining the rules based order as well and Trump will only make it worse

**Drysdale, et al, Head of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research
and East Asia Forum, '25**

\[Peter, "Time to revise our idea of who the revisionist powers are?",
East Asia Forum, 3/24/25,
<https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/03/24/time-to-revise-our-idea-of-who-the-revisionist-powers-are/>,
7/15/25 HDCSW - SG\]

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [spoke the language of the
'rules-based order' while quietly undermining it.]{.underline} Under
Donald [Trump]{.underline}, Washington [comes to bury the postwar order,
not to praise it. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
decided that the WTO and GATT are]{.underline} impediments
[to]{.underline} its [achieve]{.underline}ment of [the fantasy of
reindustrialisation behind a tariff barrier, so they can be ignored with
impunity just like China has ignored the parts of UNCLOS or its free
trade agreements that get in the way of how it wishes to exercise its
military and political power.]{.underline} The new [US]{.underline}
alliance [policy has been to muse about whether its allies are worth
protecting; its climate policy is to deny the problem
exists.]{.underline}

It wouldn't take a lot of skill to step into the global leadership void
--- and even a country with the diplomatic skills of Xi Jinping's China
can readily move to fill it. [China is positioned to exploit post-2016
scepticism about US leadership to present itself as the responsible
stakeholder in globalisation, climate action and multilateral
cooperation.]{.underline}

But even as Trump offers an opening for China to pose as the status quo
power within the US--China dyad, Beijing faces tensions between its
ambitions to project itself as a responsible leader and the imperatives
of the geopolitical competition it faces.

[In this week's lead article](https://eastasiaforum.org/?p=2343339),
Kerry Brown reviews the outcomes of the recent Two Sessions of the
National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Congress, which although broadly demure in their outputs
nonetheless highlighted how the Chinese elites see steeling the economy
for a prolonged period of an economic cold war --- and maybe an actual
war --- as a primary national goal. 'With the United States retreating
into isolationism', Brown writes, the leadership feels that 'China is
being pushed into action', with 'the accelerated weaning off US and
other foreign technology ... now a national priority'.

That is where China's opportunity to position itself as a responsible
custodian of the international economic system is in tension with
politics.

## Russia/China Arctic Cooperation

### Uniqueness---Russia/China Cooperation-Axis

#### Uniqueness\--China and Russia are increasing their presence in the Arctic, and Arctic cooperation between the two has been growing

China, as a non-Arctic actor, focuses on scientific and commercial
initiatives to establish a foothold in the region. Its 2018 Arctic
Strategy outlines three primary objectives: expanding commercial
opportunities, enhancing scientific presence, and building operational
capabilities. However, China's growing maritime activities, including
the involvement of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and its
interest in the Polar Silk Road, suggest potential security ambitions.
Governance challenges in the Arctic add complexity to China's efforts to
expand its influence. [Beijing has bolstered its regional presence
through icebreakers]{.underline}, research platforms, COSCO-operated
commercial vessels, and potentially submarine deployments. Notably[,
China has invested in deep-water port infrastructure in the Russian
Arctic and attempted to acquire a decommissioned naval
facility]{.underline} in Greenland in 2016, sparking geopolitical
concerns. Furthermore, [China maintains extensive economic ties with
Arctic nations and their regional entities, reinforcing its strategic
interests in the region]{.underline}. Interest in the Arctic is expected
to grow steadily, as its reputation as a remote and isolated region
diminishes. The Arctic is poised to assume a more prominent role in the
global economy and will increasingly draw geopolitical attention, driven
by both economic opportunities and security considerations. Russia is
expected to uphold its dominance in the Arctic, which will remain
politically, economically, and strategically significant for the
country, irrespective of its leadership. [Moscow will aim to preserve
its regional superiority, safeguard against external interference, and
capitalize on both commercial and strategic opportunities in the
region.]{.underline} On the other hand, the USA has an Arctic Strategy
which has four pillars and they are: A.Security B.Climate Change and
Environmental Protection C.Sustainable Economic Development
D.International Cooperation and Governance This strategy is intended to
serve as a framework to guide the U.S. Government's approach to
confronting the new challenges and opportunities in the Arctic.4
According to Deputy Defence Secretary Kathleen Hicks, "The Arctic region
of the United States is critical to the defence of our homeland, the
protection of U.S. national sovereignty and the preservation of our
defence treaty commitments". [The Pentagon views Russia and China as
threats due to Beijing's growing presence in the Arctic. China currently
operates three icebreakers in the region and maintains a military
presence there.]{.underline} Additionally, the [Chinese military has
showcased its Arctic capabilities by conducting joint operations with
the Russian navy. China, despite its claim of being a near-Arctic state,
is actively seeking greater influence, access, and involvement in the
region's governance. Simultaneously, Russia has been expanding its
Arctic presence by reopening Soviet-era military bases]{.underline} and
remains a significant threat to regional security and stability. [Russia
has also strengthened its military infrastructure in the Arctic while
asserting extensive claims over Arctic waters.]{.underline} Moreover,
[cooperation between China and Russia in the region has been increasing,
with China playing a key role in funding Russian energy projects and
both nations conducting joint military exercises, including off the
coast of Alaska]{.underline}.6 The exercise "Oceans-24" had more than
400 warships, submarines and support vessels, over 120 naval aircraft
and more than 90,000 personnel.7 The Department of Defense's 2024 Arctic
Strategy outlines three key priorities to address challenges in the
region. These include strengthening the capabilities of U.S. joint
forces to operate effectively in the Arctic, fostering deeper
collaboration with allies and partners, and maintaining a robust U.S.
presence through regular exercises and operations. Additionally, the
strategy emphasizes improving domain awareness by deploying advanced
monitoring and surveillance systems. In close partnership with Canada,
the U.S. aims to enhance its ability to detect and respond to potential
threats, ensuring the protection of its homeland and regional stability.

"In the decade [since gaining observer status on the Arctic Council in
2013 China has massively expanded its Arctic footprint and has begun to
work closely with Russia]{.underline} in its attempt to be seen as an
Arctic power.

"[The PRC's expanding Arctic engagement has created new opportunities
for engagement between the PRC and Russia and has resulted in
unprecedented styles of collaboration]{.underline}."

The DoD report lists a number of joint Russian-Chinese military
activities in the Arctic. [The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) sent
a small naval flotilla into the Bering Sea between Russia and Alaska for
the first time in 2015, and made visits to Denmark, Finland and Sweden
around the same time]{.underline}. [In September 2022 they conducted a
combined naval patrol in the Bering Sea. China's coastguard entered the
Arctic for the first time in 2023 in a joint patrol with
Russia]{.underline}, and [in Summer 2024 several month-long combined
operations including bomber, naval, and coast guard patrols in the
Alaskan 'Air Defence Identification Zone' jointly with Russian
assets]{.underline}. In themselves, these are not enormously
significant, but [they do point to an increasing interest in the Arctic

[A major turning point was the]{.underline} 2017 joint [announcement by
China and Russia to build the Polar Silk Road]{.underline} as part of
the BRI, a development that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
[Since then, both countries have moved fast]{.underline} to realise this
outcome. In May 2024, following Putin's state visit to Beijing, a joint
statement pledged to "jointly promote the implementation of large-scale
energy
projects."[^[\[43\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn43)
A month later, in June 2024, Rosatom and China's Hainan Yangpu NewNew
Shipping Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a
year-round container service via the NSR by using five Arctic-Class
container
ships.[^[\[44\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn44)
Further strengthening this collaboration, [in]{.underline} August
[2024]{.underline}, [Chinese Premier]{.underline} Li Qiang [and Russian
Prime Minister]{.underline} Mikhail Mishustin [signed a joint communique
agreeing to develop Arctic shipping routes and polar ship technology and
construction]{.underline}.[^[\[45\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn45)
[These]{.underline} developments [indicate that China-Russia
collaboration on the NSR is accelerating]{.underline} rapidly.

The Arctic holds considerable security implications for China. This was
underscored by Xie Peng, Vice Director of Sun Yat-sen University, who
stated in February 2023, during an event associated to the sea trials of
the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di, "[Polar capability is also listed as one of
the main fields in national security]{.underline} together with homeland
security, deep sea security, and outer space
security."[^[\[46\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn46)

[Security collaboration between Russia and China in the Arctic has
increased]{.underline} over the last year. In July 2024, the two
countries conducted joint air patrols off Alaska, an event that possibly
required Chinese H-6K bombers to refuel at Russian airbases. In
September 2024, naval ships from both countries participated in
North-Joint 2024, a Sino-Russian joint naval exercise held in the Sea of
Japan and the Sea of
Okhotsk.[^[\[47\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn47)

Russia]{.underline}.[^[\[48\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn48)
This was followed by a meeting on 21 October 2024, where Chinese Coast

[The growing partnership between Russia and China provides early warning
signs that the region could become a site of future conflict. In 2021
Russia and China renewed their 20-year-old Sino-Russian]{.underline}
Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a move
[described as "an act of friendship against America.]{.underline}"9)
Moreover, [both Russia and China have deep historic and economic ties to
the Arctic. NATO's expansion]{.underline} to include Finland and Sweden
have [increased tensions in the region,]{.underline} while both [Russia
and China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing presence
in the Arctic.]{.underline}10) However, despite feeling antagonized by
NATO's actions, Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and
military capacities to reshape the current international rules-based
order in the Arctic in the near term.

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not new.
[Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back]{.underline} to
the sixteenth century, [beginning with its conquest of
Siberia]{.underline}, which was [part of a larger initiative to search
for resources and trade routes.]{.underline}12) As the nation matured,
its Arctic ambitions did as well. [During the Cold War, the Soviets
established both a nuclear and naval presence]{.underline} on the Kola
Peninsula [to project power against the U.S]{.underline}. With the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of the
Soviet nuclear arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic
power.

As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
Putin, Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
Moreover, [in]{.underline} August [2022, Moscow announced that it would
refocus its military power on the Arctic]{.underline} and Nordic
region.14) According to Colin Wall, a research associate at Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, "[The military
balance in the Arctic is heavily weighted towards Russia.]{.underline}"
Furthermore, the International Institute for Strategic Studies and
Reuters cite that Russia's bases inside the Arctic Circle outnumber
NATO's by roughly a third.15) [Russia's remilitarization of the Arctic
and its revitalized strategic partnership with China, provides both
countries with the means to challenge the current Western rules-based
international order.]{.underline}

Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north, Beijing's desire for Arctic supremacy has rapidly
evolved over the past century. China's involvement in the Arctic began
in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard Treaty, providing a legal basis
for China to conduct non-military activity, such as scientific
exploration, resource extraction, and fishing in the Arctic.16) However,
China's rationale to operate in the region extends beyond scientific
exploration.

In 2018 China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State."17) [China]{.underline} employs a dual
narrative to explain its aims in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals
to foreign audiences by advocating for the safeguarding of international
interests and promoting sustainable Arctic development. However, this is
juxtaposed against the narrative it promotes for domestic audiences,
which [emphasizes competition for resources and]{.underline} China's
[desire to become a "polar great power."]{.underline}18) The Svalbard
Treaty has currently enabled China to shroud its military activity and
influence in the Arctic as scientific exploration and global
cooperation. But it is becoming clear from its growing partnership with
Russia and increasingly aggressive military action in the Arctic that
China's intentions to reshape the international system extend well
beyond the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. and NATO would be wise to recognize
China's aims in the Arctic.

[The historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal
that the Arctic is likely to be an arena for future strategic
competition.]{.underline} Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has
temporarily bolstered the West's position in the Arctic, as previously
neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. [Finland's accession into
NATO]{.underline} not only [increased]{.underline} the NATO-Russia land
border by over 650 percent and moved the defense alliance a mere 250
miles from St. Petersburg, but it also contributed [to creating a
divided Arctic, where nearly half belongs to NATO while the remaining
half is Russian territory.]{.underline}

[Threatened by the growing alliance,]{.underline} in June 2022, [Putin
warned that if U.S.-NATO military]{.underline} contingents or military
infrastructure [appears in]{.underline} either [Sweden or Finland,
Russia will respond]{.underline} "symmetrically" [by deploying nuclear
weapons to the Baltic Sea region]{.underline} to restore military
balance and strengthen its defenses.19) In February 2023, Putin made
good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed with tactical
nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway, this was the
first time in 30 years that this has happened.20) Then [in]{.underline}
June [2024, Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy
tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline} in Leningrad, a military district
bordering NATO members Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania.21) As evidenced by these actions, while Putin is not afraid
to rattle the nuclear saber, it is not likely that Russia has the
military or economic capacity to engage in a direct conventional
conflict with NATO.

NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window of time to prepare
for conflict against Russia. [In 2024 the head of the
Norwegian]{.underline} armed [forces warned that NATO countries only
have two to three years to prepare for a Russian attack.]{.underline}
Norwegian General Eirik Kristoffersen claims that Moscow is building up
its military stockpile faster than previously predicted, while Western
nations have depleted their own weapons by supplying them to Ukraine.22)
[Several other European leaders have echoed these concerns,]{.underline}
citing that they have between three and eight years to prepare for a
Russian attack against NATO.23) Despite Russia's aggressive rhetoric,
Moscow understands that because of its war against Ukraine it likely
will not have the capability to attack NATO in the near future. For
instance, Russia removed nearly all its ground forces from the Finnish
border to Ukraine in June 2024.24) [Russia's timeframe to launch a
successful attack is dependent]{.underline} not only on its economy but
also [on its partnership with the PRC.]{.underline}

#### Russia-China relations are strengthening. This poses a threat to rules based international law specifically in the South China sea and expanding the Arctic.

[Western policymakers sometimes comfort themselves with the idea that
the Russia-China partnership is fragile.]{.underline} Perhaps China will
lose patience with Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Perhaps Russia will
resist becoming China's junior partner.

According to Professor Aaron Danis of the Institute of World Politics
(IWP), [however, these hopes aren't realistic]{.underline}. In an
extended conversation, Danis told me that [the strategic alignment
between Moscow and Beijing may not only be enduring, but it is
apparently deepening.]{.underline}

"They don't love each other," he said, "but they agree on this: [they
want to change the West's rules-based order]{.underline}." He goes on to
say that they're not truly against a rules-based order[, but they want
the order to be based on their rules, not ours.]{.underline}

[Their shared rejection of the West in general and the United States in
particular has resulted in a partnership that is evolving from cautious
coordination to growing military and economic collaboration. Just a
decade ago, their militaries held just a few joint exercises. In 2024,
that number was 14.]{.underline} "The tempo and scope of these drills
show us [they're preparing together---for contingencies that involve
us]{.underline}," Danis warned.

[Beijing's ambitions are on full display in the South China Sea, where
it has transformed dozens of rocky outcrops into fortified islands,
complete with runways, radars, and missile systems]{.underline}. "They
start with a rock and a dredger, and they end up with what they refer to
as 'an unsinkable aircraft carrier,'" Danis said. "These new artificial
islands are a way to project power far beyond their shores and to
establish control over the South China Sea." [These actions are a threat
to the US allies in the area.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline}'s expansionist vision extends beyond the Pacific. It
[now claims to be a "near-Arctic power" and is eyeing rare earth
resources and shipping routes in the thawing North. Though Russia has
long regarded the Arctic as its domain, the two countries seem to be
carefully managing any friction this is causing.]{.underline} "There's
overlap and even rivalry in the Central Asia and the Arctic," Danis
said, "but their larger strategic goal, opposing the West, takes
precedence."

#### Russia and China are increasing their military cooperation in the Arctic---representing a threat to Arctic security. More human presence in the Arctic leads to an increased risk of miscalculations that could lead to military escalation.

[Russia and China have been displaying]{.underline}, at least on the
surface, [increased cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}, and
[especially in the military security realm]{.underline}. This includes
joint military drills at the fringe of the Arctic as well as a
willingness to conduct subthreshold activities against critical undersea
infrastructure. [There are, however, many friction points that limit a
deepening of the bilateral relationship in the Arctic. In the meantime,
the US must now navigate a more complex regional security landscape
fraught with geopolitical competition and mounting pressure from Russia
and China.]{.underline}

Arctic Military Security Cooperation

Individually, [Russia and China represent a threat to Arctic
security]{.underline}. While Moscow has been increasing its military
footprint in the region,​​ Beijing is seeking to expand its presence and
reshape regional norms to its
advantage.[^[1]{.underline}^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/sino-russian-cooperation-in-the-arctic/#footnote_0_41131)
[The threat is compounded by the impact of climate change on circumpolar
security: A more accessible Arctic will undeniably bring more human
presence, and therefore an increased risk of accidents, incidents, and
miscalculations that could lead to military
escalation.[^2^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/sino-russian-cooperation-in-the-arctic/#footnote_1_41131)]{.underline}

Circumpolar military security is an area where [Russian-Sino relations
are a threat multiplier against US and NATO interests.]{.underline}
Closer bilateral relations in Arctic security affairs have materialized
through military posturing and demonstrations of joint presence and
operations. In terms of posturing and showcasing collaboration, the
Russian Federal Security Service Border Service (Coast Guard and Border
Guard) and the Chinese Coast Guard signed a memorandum of understanding
(MoU) in April 2023 to strengthen soft security cooperation in maritime
law
enforcement.[^[3]{.underline}^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/sino-russian-cooperation-in-the-arctic/#footnote_2_41131)
Although not Arctic-specific, the document aims to fight illegal
migration, smuggling, and fishing as well as combat terrorism.

The MoU led to the organization of the first joint coast guard patrol
and drill in the Russian Arctic in September 2024 with the presence of
Chinese Coast Guard
assets.[^[4]{.underline}^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/sino-russian-cooperation-in-the-arctic/#footnote_3_41131)
Such an agreement could represent a blueprint for future cooperation in
military affairs between the Russian Pacific Fleet and China's People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).

Indeed, it is likely that the countries will seek to organize a military
exercise in the Bering Sea and/or the Chukchi Sea in the near future.
Such a drill would draw much international attention and represent a
major symbolic win for both countries. It would not necessarily mean a
genuine deepening of bilateral military relations in the Arctic but
would signal that Beijing can deploy and sustain naval force in the
region.[^[5]{.underline}^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/sino-russian-cooperation-in-the-arctic/#footnote_4_41131)

[What could follow in terms of the next steps toward greater military
linkages is the signature of a joint servicing or resupplying agreement
for Chinese assets navigating across the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federation or joint missile defense in the Sea of Okhotsk and along the
Kuril Islands/Northern Territories at the fringe of the Arctic as part
of joint ballistic missile early warning
systems.[^6^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/sino-russian-cooperation-in-the-arctic/#footnote_5_41131)]{.underline}

**[The Arctic is insufficiently prioritized amidst the United
State]{.underline}**s' competing global interests. The future
battlefield is melting and demands US attention, as **[a partnership
between Russia and the People's Republic of China fuels strategic
competition in the Arctic.]{.underline}** Thus, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **m[ust adopt a proactive
Arctic strategy]{.underline}**[,]{.underline} working with its NATO
Allies to ensure that the Arctic remains stable and free from conflict.
The US's 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United
States "seeks a stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to
internationally agreed upon rules and norms."1) To achieve a secure
Arctic, the 2024 Arctic Strategy, produced by the U.S. Department of
Defense, follows a "monitor-and-respond" approach. However, this
reactive strategy is inadequate.2)

[**Russia's**]{.underline} 2022 **[invasion of Ukraine provides evidence
that Moscow will not adhere to the current global order and
will]{.underline}** continue to **[challenge Western international norms
wherever possible, including in the Arctic.]{.underline}** NATO's
growing appeal among European states suggests that NATO may also be
called upon to guarantee the future of Arctic stability. Instead of
dividing Europe, isolating Ukraine, and expanding its influence,
**[Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a closer alliance
between the United States and its Arctic NATO allies]{.underline}**.
Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden, has expanded,,
and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO members. **[The
alliance offers an opportunity for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **t[o strengthen its position in the Arctic
region]{.underline}** while not having to go it alone.

The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions, though the makings of a more
effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024 Arctic
Strategy. Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its mindset
towards the Arctic. A proactive Arctic Strategy is needed, in which the
United States and its NATO partners are not afraid to define the rules
and laws governing the north. [**Critics**]{.underline} of this approach
will [c**laim that taking a more assertive position in the Arctic will
further antagonize Russia**]{.underline} and divert important resources
from the Indo-Pacific region and China. **[This is]{.underline}** simply
**[not the case. Russia and China have already taken steps to claim and
militarize the Arctic. By acting now, the US]{.underline}** and its NATO
allies **[will be better positioned to counter the threat
posed]{.underline}** by Russia and China **[in the Arctic]{.underline}**
and beyond.

In fact, while Trump criticizes his predecessors for mishandling Russia,
he risks overlooking the lessons of previous U.S. administrations.
[Those who believed that]{.underline} **[normalizing
relations]{.underline}** and engaging constructively [with **Moscow**
would lead to peace were **proven wrong**.]{.underline} From George W.
**[Bush]{.underline}** to Barack **[Obama]{.underline}**, [each

inadvertently **enable Russia** to achieve its strategic goals,
**undermining** the **security of Europe** and the **broader
international order**.]{.underline}

Putin's desire to speak directly to his U.S. counterparts reflects his
desire to return to a model of great-power politics, where the United
States and Russia can negotiate as equals and agree on spheres of
influence. [Putin sees Russia as a global power with a **legitimate
right** to **dominate the post-Soviet space**, which he **views** as
part of **Russia's rightful** **sphere** of **influence**.]{.underline}

Similarly, Trump has shown signs of an expansionist mindset, aiming to
assert U.S. dominance through both military and economic power. He has
suggested using military force to secure control over the Panama Canal
and Greenland, as well as using economic coercion to gain control of
Canada. While the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration [risks

NSR=North Sea Route

[Moscow seeks to **appropriate** the **NSR** as a **body** of **internal
waters regulated by Russian law,**]{.underline} [and no longer linked to
**UNCLOS** under the **principles of freedom** of **navigation** and
**innocent passage**]{.underline}. [This obsession for control responds
to the fear of '**encirclement'** in the **Arctic** and the
**unwarranted belief** that **NATO** will soon **contest** the
self-appropriation of the NSR.]{.underline}

Russian fears have crystallized in the belief that NATO or the United

through the NSR to 'test' innocent passage in contested waters. [Most of
**these fears** **remain unfounded**, **especially** since there is
**little value** in **arranging** such an **operation** as well as high
operational risk]{.underline}.22)

[The fact remains that the Kremlin's]{.underline} [rhetoric]{.underline}
around a potential Western-led FONOP [has grown **aggressive in recent
months**]{.underline}, [with NATO arguably seeking to
'snatch]{.underline}'23) [the **NSR** from under **Russia's
control**]{.underline}. Furthermore, the Russian armed forces and the

Finally, [with its attacks on **Ukraine**, Russia has **officially
debunked** the]{.underline} oft-repeated [narrative]{.underline} that
[its]{.underline} economic [interests guarantee its participation in
preserving regional **peace** and **stability**. Moscow has **long
harbored grand designs** of developing its vast **Arctic coastline** and
extracting **more** of the resources found off them]{.underline}. As a
result, many believed it would have an interest in maintaining peace and
stability in the Arctic, so that it could attract foreign investment to
these projects and increase cargo traffic in the Northern Sea Route. But
[it's **hard**]{.underline} to believe in this logic, or [to take
**comfort** in reports of Russia's relatively **restrained conduct** in
the Arctic]{.underline}, at a time [when its government has
**substantially increased** its **military assets** in the region
and]{.underline} when Russian President Vladimir [Putin is **openly
threatening war**]{.underline} if other states cross his red lines.

The West's unease on these points can be seen clearly in its
surprisingly robust and united effort to pull the plug on the Russian
economy by imposing coordinated sanctions on its key sectors. However,
Western leaders will also need to grapple with another dimension of
great-power politics as they attempt to isolate Moscow: the
inevitability of greater Chinese presence in the Arctic, and, more
broadly, the presence of other non-Arctic states.

As Western capital and technologies depart from Russia's energy sector,
[Moscow will be **more prone** to cooperate with **Beijing**
on]{.underline} developing [its Arctic resources, an outcome that would
further complicate Arctic governance]{.underline} by directly exposing
it to the dynamics of the U.S.-China great-power rivalry. And if Beijing
increases its commercial stakes in the Arctic, that would also make it
harder for the U.S. to denounce China's once-ridiculed narrative that it
is a "near-Arctic" state that should be included in any regional
agenda-setting initiatives.

Winter is coming early this year in the Arctic. Last month, a Chinese
and Russian joint surface action group came within 75 nautical miles of
Kiska Island, Alaska. In response, the Coast Guard mobilized a patrol to
monitor the ships as they approached American home waters. A year prior,
several Chinese warships had entered the U.S. exclusive economic zone
off Alaska.

[These **repeated tests** of **American resolve** so close to our
**shores** should **set off alarm** **bells** in
**Washington**]{.underline}. Our two greatest adversaries, **[China and
Russia]{.underline}**, [are now cooperating on the **high seas** to
**challenge** our **presence** in the **region**.]{.underline}

[Chinese and Russian attempts to gain superiority in the Arctic are not
new]{.underline}. In 2015, five Chinese vessels marked President Barack
Obama's visit to the Bering Sea with battle drills off the Alaskan
coast. [Russia has long maintained a strong military presence in the
**Arctic**, even after the **end** of the **Cold War**.]{.underline}

[What is different now, however, is that our **rivals' power
projection** in the polar regions is **outpacing our own**]{.underline}.
As a self-described "near-Arctic power," China has been working to build
a "Polar Silk Road" of economic and military infrastructure across the
Arctic. Meanwhile, [**Russia** is developing its **already-formidable
capabilities** to disrupt freedom of **navigation** and **U.S.
operations.**]{.underline}

[If China and Russia reach their goals, the Arctic will emerge as a
central theater in our **respective** **competitions**]{.underline}.
[Alaska]{.underline} [is]{.underline} a [vital]{.underline} location
[for monitoring Chinese and Russian **missile forces**]{.underline}.
[The Arctic's natural characteristics also make it ripe for **space
launch**, **reconnaissance**, and energy resource capture]{.underline}.
[Losing **the upper hand** in the]{.underline} [Arctic could result in
our **exclusion** from the **region militarily** and
economically]{.underline} --- an ominous prospect, given the trajectory
of American relations with Russia and China.

The United States has already been caught flat-footed, as we have
invested relatively little in our Arctic forces. For example, [the
combined **icebreaker fleets** of our adversaries **outpace** ours by
more than **25 to 1.**]{.underline}

[U.S. leaders simply have not met the Arctic challenge,]{.underline} and
we are only beginning to confront this reality now. In recent months,
the Biden Administration has created new posts at the Pentagon and State
Department to address Arctic security. And more recently, the White
House rolled out a comprehensive political-military strategy for the
Arctic, which includes a call for a greater military presence in the
region.

[Our core challenge, however, is that the U.S. defense industrial base
will essentially be starting from scratch to field these
capabilities]{.underline}. Decades of low investment in icebreakers from
the federal government has left U.S. shipbuilders unprepared to service
even the best defense strategy. Today, only one shipyard in the United
States is building polar icebreakers, and we are set to add just three
of these crucial ships by 2030. [Without **sustained investment** in
these **capabilities**, there is little hope of maintaining **long-term
U.S. power** in the **region**.]{.underline}

Congress has worked to authorize funding for a twelfth national security
cutter in this year's defense bill, but much more needs to be done. [We
need to **expand** the **icebreaker program** and substantially increase
the budget for U.S. Northern Command]{.underline}, which would give
planners the tools they need to navigate this unstable strategic
environment.

Russia and China's latest target, Kiska Island, became known during
World War II as one of few U.S. territories ever to be occupied by a
foreign nation. Japanese control of the island came to an end in 1943
when Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and his cruisers expelled the Japanese.
Since then, U.S. forces have continued a proud tradition of Arctic
operations, including the first deployment of a nuclear submarine in
1954.

It appears Kiska --- and indeed the United States --- is once again
coming under threat from a Pacific power. [The **moment** demands that
we **unleash the full might** of our **defense industrial base** to
**secure our foothold** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [As the proverbial
winter with **China** and **Russia comes**, we should **prepare
ourselves to weather it**.]{.underline}

#### IB specific\--Russia [exploits]{.underline} a lack of American presence. The plan is necessary to increase deterrence.

[The **Arctic** is no longer just a **frozen expanse**---it is **quickly
becoming a geopolitical hotspot**]{.underline}. As its ice diminishes,
its economic potential has increased. Arctic shipping routes between the
Atlantic and Pacific offer the potential to reduce travel times by up to
40%, and the area is estimated to contain 13% of the world's
undiscovered oil and 30% of its untapped natural gas reserves. However,
[far less attention has been given to what is required for successful
**U.S. deterrence** in the Arctic, **particularly in countering Russia's
assertiveness.**]{.underline}

[The Arctic is **particularly valuable** for **America's
competitors**]{.underline}. [Russia has used the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} (NSR) [to bypass the West\'s \$60-per-barrel oil
price cap]{.underline}. In 2023, a record 80% of Russian oil exports
were shipped via non-G7 tankers, avoiding the cap, with exports to China
rising by 23% since the invasion of Ukraine. Oil shipments along the NSR
have also surged, growing from zero before the war to over ten in 2023.
[Given the Arctic\'s strategic]{.underline} economic and **[military
importance]{.underline}**, the U[.S. must bolster its **infrastructure**
and military **capabilities** for **successful deterrence**, which it
currently lacks.]{.underline}

During his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier
this year, General Gregory M. Guillot, the Commander of the U.S.
Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), warned that "we're severely outnumbered"
and have limited "freedom of maneuver" in the Arctic. [The numbers
**concerning icebreakers**, which are crucial for **enabling naval
forces** to **navigate ice-covered waters**, are **particularly
stark**]{.underline}. [Compared to Russia's seven **nuclear-powered**
and thirty diesel-powered icebreakers]{.underline}, [the **U.S.
operates** only **two diesel-powered icebreakers**]{.underline}. Since
the Polar Sea, one of the U.S.'s two heavy polar icebreakers, suffered
an engine casualty in 2010, the Coast Guard has relied on the Polar Star
as its sole operational heavy icebreaker.

Meanwhile, **[Russia]{.underline}** [continues to **expand its
icebreaker** **fleet** to reinforce its regional
**dominance**]{.underline}. Through its Project 22220 initiative,
[Russia is developing at least six **nuclear-powered
icebreakers**]{.underline}: three already built, a fourth under
construction, and two more in development. [Decades of sustained
investment have given Russia a **commanding** **presence** in the
Arctic---one that the **U.S. is currently unprepared to
counter.**]{.underline}

Delays and rising costs have beset efforts to modernize its Arctic
icebreaker fleet. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program won't deliver
its first icebreaker ready until 2029. Unresolved design issues and
rising material and labor costs have increased the price of the first
three ships by 39 percent. As a result, the Coast Guard must spend \$15
million per year to repair the aging Polar Star, which first entered
service in 1976. The U.S. Coast Guard assessed that America needs at
least eight icebreakers -- four heavy and four medium ships -- for its
future polar missions. Without a shift in Arctic policy, the U.S. and
its allies may struggle to counter Russia's increasing influence.

Such a shift will require collaboration. Currently, the U.S. ranks 19th
in global shipbuilding. Increased coordination with allies is essential
to reduce costs, accelerate production, and innovate. In July 2024, the
U.S., Canada, and Finland launched the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
(ICE Pact) to pool resources and enhance polar capabilities. While the
ICE Pact is a key step in strengthening the West\'s Arctic strategy,
further cooperation with NATO allies is needed, especially as a Pentagon
report from July 2024 warned of growing Arctic ties between Russia and
China.

[Long-term icebreaker needs cannot be met without greater shipbuilding
cooperation with allies]{.underline}. Two existing laws prevent the
Coast Guard from building vessels or major components in foreign
shipbuilding ports. The President can authorize an exception if it is in
the national security interest -- and this clearly is. Both Canada and
Finland are close NATO allies with a shared interest in countering
Russian power in the Arctic. If the President is serious about closing
the force projection gap, exemptions to allow shipbuilding collaboration
with our allies will be necessary.

[In addition to icebreaker production, increased **military
cooperation** with allies is crucial for **effective
deterrence**]{.underline}. Access to Alaska's Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base has enabled the U.S. and
its allies to conduct joint military exercises, such as the Arctic
Defender exercise in July 2024, which involved approximately 500
personnel from the U.S., Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France.
Expanding exercises like Arctic Defender -- particularly among other
Arctic nations -- would further bolster interoperability, improve
operational readiness, and communicate collective resolve to deter
adversaries.

The Coast Guard should also collaborate with commercial companies to
expedite the design and construction of additional icebreakers. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office found that delays in the Polar Security
Cutter program were caused by beginning construction before the design
was completed. Partnering with the private sector could streamline the
process and accelerate production. While the U.S. ordered its first
commercial icebreaker last month, more are needed to close the
icebreaker gap. Alaska's congressional delegation secured \$125 million
in funding for this purchase, but broader congressional support is
essential to meet the full scope of Arctic security needs.

[Polar ice may diminish, but tension over the Arctic will only increase
as its strategic value grows]{.underline}. On September 10, 2024, Russia
and China began a massive week-long \"Ocean-24\" joint naval exercise
covering the Arctic Ocean, indicating that their growing alignment may
extend to Arctic interests. Similarly, [Russian military aircraft have
been more frequently spotted in Alaska's Air Defense Identification
Zone]{.underline}, including three times in the last week. If the U.S.
fails to make necessary adjustments, it risks losing its foothold in the
Arctic and falling further behind Russia and China's increasing military
presence. [A reinvigorated **icebreaker procurement program** and
partnerships with allies are indispensable to closing the **polar
icebreaker** **gap** to **deter American adversaries** **before** it\'s
**too late**.]{.underline}

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [**Failing** to **establish** a surface presence in the
Arctic with icebreakers could yield an "**asymmetric equalizer**" for
**adversaries**,]{.underline} [a risk that becomes **more imminent** as
**polar ice melts** and access to the **Arctic increases**.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, "the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it, however serendipitously." [**Russia** and **China**
are actively moving the Great Power Competition to the
Arctic]{.underline}: [**Russia** is arming its icebreakers with
**anti-ship weapons** and **cruise missiles**]{.underline}, [both
nations are regularly patrolling the **Arctic** seas **with
icebreakers**]{.underline}, [and heavily investing in **nuclear
technology** for these **vessels**]{.underline}. While icebreakers are
certainly necessary for the Coast Guard's missions---including search
and rescue, navigation, environmental protection, interdiction, and ice
operations---[**Russia and China** have **embraced icebreakers** as
dual-use assets that **squarely address** the **Navy's
purpose**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the Navy and Air Force's existing
**submarine** and **aircraft presence** in the Arctic is inadequate for
the Great Power Competition]{.underline}. [Submarines and aircraft alone
cannot]{.underline} "clear a path for critical shipping, respond to oil
spills, or conduct maritime safety and security boardings in the U.S.

control** and **power projection** in the region.]{.underline}

[Continued investments in **Arctic-specific**]{.underline} hardware and
[**equipment** are **paramount** for **successfully deterring Russia's
contestation efforts** and Chinese regional
**encroachments**]{.underline}. More than ever, Arctic capabilities must
respond to specific missions.

[NATO and allies must define what **capabilities** they **will require
to operate** in the **region**.]{.underline} As noted above, across the
NATO 7 nations critical capabilities gaps abound, in cold weather
hardware, ice-strengthened assets, ice-capable ships with anti-aircraft
and anti-submarine capabilities,129 infrastructure suited for effective
early warning threat detection systems and air defense,130 radar
coverage and aerial domain awareness, subsea sensing, and Arctic-related
logistics and resupplies, among others.

An essential part of the US DoD Arctic strategy's "monitor-and-respond"
approach is to enhance US Arctic capabilities in critical areas such as
domain awareness and dedicated cold weather equipment.50 [Yet the US and
the Arctic 7 as a whole have a low **starting point** in terms of cold
weather and **ice-strengthened capabilities.**]{.underline}

[Regarding **conventional capabilities**]{.underline}, [the current
**environment** has **shown the need** to increase **physical access**

### China Arctic Threat

#### China is using the Arctic to become a maritime great power

**Khanna, Assistant Military Adviser at the National Security Council
Secretariat in New Delhi, '25**

China categorises the Arctic as an important interest, best articulated
in a research paper written by Patrick Anderson where he quotes a
Chinese scholar as saying: "The Arctic is certainly not China's core
interest \[...\] China's surrounding areas are China's core interest
areas. The Arctic ... can be classified as a "critical" or "strategic"
area. It is strategically important. That's it. It is not a core
interest, but an important interest \[...\] \[China\] has core
interests, important interests and, if you divide further, peripheral
interests. The salience of China's engagement with the poles has even
found mention at the highest levels when Xi Jinping stated in 2014 that
"[The polar regions have a unique role in \[China's\] maritime
development strategy, and the process of becoming a polar great power is
an important component of China's process of becoming a maritime great
power]{.underline}"

#### U.S. deterrence is essential to reduce Chinese military presence in the Arctic

[Security collaboration between Russia and China in the Arctic has
increased]{.underline} over the last year. In July 2024, the two
countries conducted joint air patrols off Alaska, an event that possibly
required Chinese H-6K bombers to refuel at Russian airbases.
[In]{.underline} September [2024, naval ships from both countries
participated in]{.underline} North-Joint 2024, [a]{.underline}
Sino-Russian [joint naval exercise]{.underline} held in the Sea of Japan
and the Sea of
Okhotsk.[^[\[47\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn47)
[In]{.underline} October [*2024*, the Chinese Coast Guard]{.underline}
[conducted its first Arctic patrol in a joint exercise with
Russia]{.underline}.[^[\[48\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn48)
This was followed by a meeting on 21 October 2024, where Chinese Coast
Guard Chief Major General Yu Zhong and Admiral Roman Tolok called for
deeper "pragmatic maritime
cooperation".[^[\[49\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn49)

[As China's military presence in the Arctic grows, one of the strategic
goals would be to conduct]{.underline} [SSBN deterrence
patrols]{.underline} in the region. This would enhance China's
second-strike capability by shortening ranges and expanding delivery
options for nuclear weapons. However, a major obstacle to such
operations is the shallow waters in the Bering Strait, which would make
fully submerged transit hazardous. One potential solution could be the
semi-permanent basing of Chinese boomers in Russian Arctic ports.
However, achieving such a level of trust and cooperation between the two
nations would require deeper consensus on their overlapping security
interests.

China's engagement with the Arctic has grown exponentially in the last
decade, and it is on track to surpass most Arctic littoral nations in
capacity, with the notable exception of Russia. Several key factors have
contributed to this shift.

[China has made considerable institutional investments in Arctic science
and research.]{.underline} This has been [assisted by a rapidly
increasing fleet of icebreaking research vessels]{.underline}, which
provide the necessary platforms and logistical capability for these
activities. Additionally, the erosion of Arctic exceptionalism has made
the Arctic Eight more accommodating of other nations interests in the
area.[^[\[50\]]{.underline}^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/china-and-the-arctic-an-overview#_edn50)

[The war in Ukraine]{.underline} and the consequent isolation of Russia
[have resulted in Russia greatly facilitating China's ingress in the
Arctic]{.underline}. China's booming shipping sector also positions the
country to meet the increasing demand for commercial icebreakers and
ice-class vessels.

Additionally, [the growing]{.underline} great power [rivalry between the
US and China has provided the strategic motivation for China to secure
access to Arctic resources and shipping lanes]{.underline}. The rapid
ice melt associated with climate change has also provided an opportunity
that China has moved fast to capitalise on, positioning itself as a key
player in the evolving Arctic landscape.

#### Turn\--Ship building necessary to deter US-China war\-\--likely resulting in nuclear war. The US must increase its manufacturing capacity with the help of other like-minded countries to deter China.

[War between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China
would be devastating for]{.underline} both states and [the world. Such a
conflict could include a nuclear exchange and the likelihood of that
exchange spiraling out of control is high. Avoiding war between the U.S.
and China must be the highest priority of the incoming
administration.]{.underline}

[China is a rising, revisionist great power, while the U.S. is a
declining, status quo great power]{.underline}. In such a situation,
variables lean toward war. [To avoid war, the costs must clearly
outweigh the benefits for the revisionist state -- China -- and foster
deterrence.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [because the U.S. has denuded itself of manufacturing,
internal balancing has reduced impact on China. But external balancing
-- cooperating or allying with like-minded states -- may impact China's
cost-benefit calculation.]{.underline} In the Indo-Pacific, this means
cooperating with states that have deterrent-inducing characteristics.
These characteristics include industrial capacity, operational benefits,
strategic depth, and countervailing strengths.

[Because China has such a massive manufacturing advantage, it would
probably win a long conventional war with the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. As the U.S. out-manufactured
past opponents in the 20^th^ century, so too [China could replace lost
military capacity more quickly and in far greater amounts than the U.S.
could]{.underline}. It has been widely noted that the Office of Naval
Intelligence estimates [that China's shipbuilding capacity is 232 times
greater than America's.]{.underline} China's overall manufacturing
capacity is 31 percent of global output while the U.S. accounts for only
16 percent.

[The U.S. must bolster manufacturing capacity by cooperating with
like-minded states.]{.underline} Regional allies Japan and South Korea
both have significant manufacturing capacity and some of it in key areas
such as shipbuilding. The U.S. should begin using that capacity for
maintenance work and eventually for production of certain U.S. assets.
Formal agreements on cooperative manufacturing should be reached with
both countries.

### More Revisionism Cards

#### Russian revisionism sets a precedent

**Zhang, Department of Criminal Justice and Security Studies, '25**

\[Weidong, "Why States Become Revisionists: A Literature Review", IASR,
2025, <https://iasr.or.kr/xml/45426/45426.pdf>, HDCSW 7/14/25 - SG\]

[The rise of countries such as China and India]{.underline} triggers a
fierce debate on whether they will maintain the status quo or [challenge
the existing international order with revisionist
intentions]{.underline} (Turner & Nymalm, 2019). [The
international]{.underline} community's [concern for state revisionism
has been especially intense since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. If not
punished, Russia's encroachment on Ukraine's territories may set a
precedent and encourage]{.underline} assertive foreign policies toward
their neighbors by [countries with similar territorial
ambitions]{.underline} (Hensel et al., 2022). Territorial disputes,
among all issues that may cause conflict among states, are most likely
to escalate to war (Vasquez & Henehan, 2023). State [revisionism is
highly destabilizing to the international order.]{.underline} The stakes
are very high here. To deal with it, we need to understand state
revisionism better first. The central theme of this paper is to
investigate why states become revisionists.

#### Russia is revisionist--its use of illicit finance proves.

**Lewis, Professor of Global Politics, and Prelec, Research Fellow at
the Department of Politics at the University of Oxford, 25**

\[David and Tena, "Corruption and Revisionism: The Role of Illicit
Finance in Russian Foreign Policy", Public Integrity, 6/18/25,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10999922.2025.2512497#abstract>,
7/12/25 HDCSW - AS\]

Third, [illicit finance is an appropriate tool for a revisionist
power]{.underline} (Popovic, 2024). Some Russian foreign policy analysts
argue that Russia is now a revolutionary power, "for the first time
since the Bolshevik Revolution." According to Dmitry Trenin, "[The last
two years have produced nothing less than a revolution in Moscow's
foreign policy,]{.underline} more radical and far-reaching than anything
anticipated on the eve of the Ukraine intervention." Consequently,
"[Russia's international role, its position in the world, its goals and
methods of reaching them, its basic world-view -- all are
changing]{.underline}" (Trenin, 2024). The extent of this shift in
strategy can be disputed, but the evidence suggests that [Russia is no
longer primarily concerned with maintaining or enhancing its role in the
existing global financial and trading system but would prefer to promote
systemic change]{.underline}. Its position is partly driven by strategic
and ideological goals -- [Russia wishes to challenge the U.S.-led
financial system and the hegemony of the U.S. dollar as part of its
wider campaign against U.S. geopolitical dominance]{.underline} -- and
partly by necessity -- [economic sanctions have forced Russia to resort
to off-the-books financial transactions, shadow logistics and supply
chains, and covert business deals to source both conventional imports
and military technology]{.underline} and armaments. In this context,
[Russia views illicit finance as both a legitimate means to achieve
strategic and political outcomes and, in some cases, preferable
precisely because it does help to undermine existing rules-based
international systems]{.underline}.

#### China and Russia are revisionist powers

**Stent, Nonresident Senior Fellow - Foreign policy, '20**

\[Angela, "Russia and China: Axis of revisionists?", Brookings, February
2020,
<https://www.brookings.edu/articles/russia-and-china-axis-of-revisionists/>,
7/14/25 HDCSW - SG\] The China-Russia relationship has become an
increasingly robust, pragmatic strategic partnership since 2014, in part
because the United States is pursuing policies that have driven the two
countries closer together. Presidents Vladimir [Putin and Xi Jinping are
both authoritarian leaders whose primary preoccupation is regime
survival]{.underline} and who are allergic to Western criticisms of
their domestic systems and the repressive policies of their respective
governments. [China and Russia are revisionist powers in as much as they
share a commitment to creating a "post-West" global order]{.underline}
which takes their interests into account and is conducive to
authoritarian rule.

MOSCOW, June 11 (Reuters) - [Talks between Russia and the United States
aimed at improving ties and removing \"irritants\" in their relationship
are **not expected to yield quick results**]{.underline}, the Kremlin
said on Wednesday.

\"Well, let\'s say that [there are **a lot of blockages** in bilateral

results,]{.underline} but this is precisely the kind of complex
step-by-step work that has begun and will continue,\" Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Peskov told reporters, denying that dialogue had stalled.

Since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, the two
countries have launched a series of contacts aimed at improving
relations which the Kremlin had described as \"below zero\" under the
previous administration of Joe Biden.

Both sides say there is huge potential for business and investment deals
if relations improve. But **[Trump]{.underline}**, [despite holding four
phone calls with President Vladimir Putin]{.underline}, [has **voiced
frustration**]{.underline} [about]{.underline} [Russia\'s war **actions

deal**]{.underline}.

Russia\'s new ambassador to Washington said earlier on Wednesday that
U.S.-Russia bilateral talks would soon move to Moscow from Istanbul.

\"**[The recovery of Russian-American relations is still a long way
off]{.underline}**,\" ambassador Alexander Darchiev told TASS news
agency, adding that the rapprochement was [being slowed by the so-called

It means, literally, American Hills. How appropriate. After all,
[with]{.underline} President Donald [Trump now operating the
ride,]{.underline} [and Vladimir Putin pressing some of the
buttons]{.underline}, **[US-Russian relations have become one of late,
with highs and lows and twists and turns]{.underline}**. [You never know
quite where you are now]{.underline}. Analysing geopolitical trends is
hard enough at the best of times. It\'s even harder careering along on
the American Hills of the 47th US president. When Trump returned to the
White House in January, his direction of travel was clear: he set out to
repair relations with Russia. There were Trump/Putin phone calls,
high-level US-Russia negotiations. At one point Washington voted with
Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the
\"aggressor\" in Russia\'s war against Ukraine. Whenever the Trump
administration exerted pressure, it was always on Kyiv, never on the
Kremlin. But a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.
[After]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin had proposed replacing]{.underline}
President Volodymyr [Zelensky\'s administration with \"external
governance]{.underline}\" in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN,
President [Trump made it known that **he was \"angry\" with
Putin**.]{.underline} \"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the
things that were said over the last day or two having to do with
Zelensky,\" Trump commented on 30 March. \"Because when \[Putin\]
considers Zelensky not credible, he\'s supposed to be making a deal with
him. Whether you like him or you don\'t like him.\" After a day playing
golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, told the
Guardian newspaper: \"I think America, and my sense is also the
president of the United States, is running out of patience with
Russia.\" **[Trump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of up to 50%
on Russian oil exports]{.underline}** [if]{.underline} [Russia was found
to be dragging its heels on a Ukraine peace deal. A bi-partisan group of
US senators has gone even further]{.underline}. [They\'ve drawn up a
bill that would impose **500% secondary tariffs** on countries that
purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.]{.underline} Up to this
point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in relations between
Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper last month ran
a headline stating that US and Russian officials had \"started speaking
the same language\". This week things changed. On Wednesday, Moskovsky
Komso[molets newspaper accused the Trump administration of
\"administrative **insanity**... **inexperience**...
**immaturity**]{.underline}\". [It **criticised the administration\'s
\"bragging and arrogance\"**]{.underline} [and \"its desire to declare
\'huge breakthroughs\' when the first steps have barely been
taken]{.underline}\". The same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On
Ukraine talks, **[Donald\'s mood changes as often as the
wind]{.underline}**.\" Signs, perhaps, of a cold wind blowing between
Moscow and Washington? And yet when Trump announced his sweeping tariffs
this week, Russia wasn\'t on the list. Instead, US authorities had
organised a sanctions waiver for a key Kremlin official: Putin\'s
foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Dmitriev flew into Washington
for talks with the Trump administration. A sign, perhaps, of Russia and
America getting on with the business of... getting along? But on Friday,
another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a meeting of
Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. \"President Trump\'s not going to
fall into the trap of endless negotiations about negotiations,\" said US
Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"We will know soon enough, in a matter
of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not.\"

### Non-Unique---Ukraine Thumps

#### 2AC\--Non Unique---Ukraine Thumps\--The U.S. established a partnership with Ukraine, sending a major message to Russia that the U.S. is committed to Ukraine

From start to finish, [this]{.underline} agreement is [a fully
collaborative partnership]{.underline} between our nations,
[that]{.underline} both the United States and Ukraine will benefit from.

This partnership [represents the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [taking a]{.underline}n economic [stake in securing
a free, peaceful, and sovereign future for Ukraine.]{.underline}

[This agreement will also strengthen]{.underline} the strategic
partnership between the United States and Ukraine for [long-term
reconstruction and modernization, in response to the]{.underline}
large-scale [destruction caused by Russia's full-scale
invasion.]{.underline}

The Treasury Department and the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation (DFC) will work together with the Government of Ukraine to
finalize governance and advance this important partnership.

The United States' DFC will work together with Ukraine's State
Organization Agency on Support Public-Private Partnership, both of which
are backed by the full faith and credit of their respective nations.

President [Trump envisioned]{.underline} this partnership between the
Americans and the Ukrainians to show both sides' [commitment to lasting
peace and prosperity in Ukraine]{.underline}

This partnership between the United States and Ukraine establishes a
fund that will receive 50% of royalties, license fees, and other similar
payments from natural resource projects in Ukraine.

That money will be invested in new projects in Ukraine, which will
generate long term returns for both the American and Ukrainian peoples.

As new projects are identified, resources in the fund can be quickly
allocated towards economic growth, job creation, and other key Ukrainian
development priorities.

Indirect benefits will include a stronger private sector and more
robust, lasting infrastructure for Ukraine's long-term success.

The partnership will be controlled by a company with equal
representation of three Ukrainian and three American board members, who
will work together through a collaborative process to make decisions for
allocation of fund resources, such as investment and distributions.

The partnership will also bring the highest levels of transparency and
accountability to ensure that the people of Ukraine and the United
States are able to enjoy the benefits of Ukraine's reconstruction.

[Natural resource projects will include minerals, hydrocarbons, and
related infrastructure development.]{.underline}

If the United States decides to acquire these resources for ourselves,
we will given first choice to either acquire them or designate the
purchaser of our choice.

Economic security is national security, and this important safeguard
prevents critical resources from falling into the wrong hands.

[Importantly, this partnership sends a strong message to Russia -- the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has skin in the game and [is
committed to Ukraine's long-term success.]{.underline}

[No state, company, or person who financed or supplied the Russian war
machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of
Ukraine]{.underline}, including participation in projects supported by
fund resources.

HDCSW-Packet

MOSCOW (AP) --- [Russia-U.S. **relations** are in a state of
**"unprecedented crisis"** without]{.underline} any [**sign** of
**improvement**]{.underline}, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov argued that [the White House's
emphasis on increasing]{.underline} weapons [supplies to
**Ukraine**]{.underline} to ensure Russia's defeat [leaves no room for
**diplomacy**]{.underline}.

"[I don't see any prospect for a productive **political** and
**diplomatic process**]{.underline}," Ryabkov said at a briefing. "We
have a very deep and unprecedented crisis in Russia-U.S. relations. The
[Biden]{.underline} administration [has driven them into a
**deadlock**]{.underline}."

Ryabkov warned that the U.S. and its allies must carefully assess the
risks stemming from supplying increasingly powerful Western weapons to
Ukraine.

"The Americans need to thoroughly and deeply weigh the risks linked to
their unabashedly cavalier course," he said.

Ryabkov noted that [Moscow doesn't **trust** Western **statements**
about self-imposed **restrictions**]{.underline} on a range of weapons
supplied to Ukraine [in order to avoid **escalation**]{.underline},
adding that [such assurances in the past have served as **cover** for a
**steady expansion**]{.underline} of the assortment of arms deliveries.

"We don't see any sign of reason in any of the NATO and EU members'
capitals," Ryabkov said. "What they are doing isn't going to strengthen
their security."

He rejected the U.S. argument that Russia's refusal to allow the
resumption of inspections of its nuclear facilities represents a breach
of the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact
between the two countries.

The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than
1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.
The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify
compliance.

Just days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia
and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.

Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START
since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused
to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact's future.
Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations
under the treaty.

The U.S. State Department last week said that Russia's refusal to allow
the inspections "prevents the United States from exercising important
rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian
nuclear arms control." It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors
from conducting inspections of the U.S. facilities.

Ryabkov on Thursday insisted that Russia has continued to comply with
the treaty and exchange information in accordance with it. "We adhere to
the treaty and observe its provisions," he said.

At the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow's view that resuming inspections
wasn't possible in the current environment.

Ryabkov's comments followed a Russian Foreign Ministry's statement
declaring that [it was **impossible** to **maintain "business as
usual"** with Washington at a time when "the U.S. has]{.underline}
effectively [unleashed a]{.underline} total [**hybrid war** against
**Russia**]{.underline}, which is fraught with a real danger of a direct
military confrontation between the two nuclear powers."

which Putin indicated a desire to reach a peace agreement. Trump said he
has come to the conclusion that **"the talk doesn't mean

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at which [Trump announced the

7/9/24 HDCSW - SG\]

President **[Trump said]{.underline}** on Monday that **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would send more
weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}** to help it fend off Russia's invasion,
arguing that Moscow's recent assault on Ukrainian cities left him with
little choice.

Mr. Trump's comments appeared to signal a reversal from the president
after his administration paused some arms transfers to the country just
last week, raising fears that the United States was retrenching its
support. Instead, Mr. **[Trump said]{.underline}** on Monday that **[he
had grown unhappy with]{.underline}** President Vladimir V.
**[Putin]{.underline}** of Russia, **[who has frustrated Mr. Trump's
hopes to broker a cease-fire.]{.underline}**

"We're going to send some more weapons," Mr. Trump told reporters at the
White House. "We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves.
They're getting hit very hard. Now they're getting hit very hard. We're
going to have to send more weapons, defensive weapons, primarily, but
they're getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in that
mess."

Those statements were a remarkable turnaround for Mr. Trump, who has
often expressed skepticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Just months ago, he
dressed down President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office,
claiming he had been insufficiently grateful for America's support.

After Mr. Trump's remarks, the Pentagon confirmed late Monday that the
flow of munitions to Ukraine was resuming.

"At President Trump's direction, **[the D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense **[is sending additional
defensive weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}** to ensure the Ukrainians can
defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the
killing stops," Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in a
statement.

Broaden our focus. [One **common** cause of **failure** in dealing with

[cause that can be resolved through a focused]{.underline} and

expansionism, believing resolute counter-pressure will quell Russian
appetites for aggression. [We have attempted to seek progress through

**headway** on such issues as counter-terrorism can build **momentum**

compartmentalized approach makes]{.underline} abundant [sense
intuitively]{.underline}. Why complicate things, when one can break the
problem down into its component parts and focus on what is most salient
or easily achievable? It is also driven by the bureaucratic silo effect,
which encourages narrow specialization while discouraging
cross-organizational integration. [But **it has not worked** in

relationship has **spiraled** ever deeper into **dysfunction and
distrust**]{.underline} [from admin]{.underline}istration [to

expert Russell Ackoff has observed about "messes," his term for wicked

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the U.S.
and Russian militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[been]{.underline} **[very careful]{.underline}** [to avoid directly
shooting at one another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might
end.]{.underline}** Q: [Are we close to full-scale world
war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No. The U.S. has **not
attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not attacked** the
U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely likely at this
point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of Russian military strikes
on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is there a more likely course of Russian
retaliation against the U.S.? D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be
regarded as **extremely unlikely**]{.underline}. [If such an attack were
to take place, the U.S. would]{.underline} **[likely seek to
respond]{.underline}** [in a way that is **proportional**]{.underline}
[but **not escalatory.**]{.underline} [**Uncertainty** about what would
lead to]{.underline} **[escalation]{.underline}** [explains why the U.S.
and Russia take]{.underline} **[such care]{.underline}** [to avoid
direct combat]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [Russians understand that they **too are
vulnerable**]{.underline}. It is also quite likely that [with Russian
forces already **overextended** fighting against **Ukraine**, Russian
leaders realize that a **second major conflict** is not in their
interest.]{.underline} Q: Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the
cost of war for Russia, in terms of the human toll and economics? Has
Russia made resource and allocation adjustments in the past months that
will allow it to sustain these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war
efforts appear to be unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of
soldiers and expended significant amounts of ammunition, such that
commanders in the field are complaining about shortages and are
suggesting that they may soon have to switch from offense to defense,
which is less costly in terms of people and materiel. Overall, the
Russian economy is holding up. Growth is very slow, and shortages of
various imported goods are mounting, but there are no signs that
economic factors will severely constrain the war effort any time soon.
However, it would appear that [before the Russian military could
undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline}, [a significant
**program of recruitment**,]{.underline} **[training]{.underline}**,
[and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need to take place]{.underline}.
[It appears that Russia **cannot retake**]{.underline} [the offensive in

"[The likelihood of Russia choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin choosing --
[to use nuclear weapons directly against the West is **astronomically
low**. **It should not even be seriously considered at this stage**,"
says Katherine Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent
Institute for the Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously
tracked Russia's military movements since it first invaded Ukraine.
"[Putin would love it if Western leaders believed that he might. He is
many things, but **he is not suicidal**]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She
adds that Putin ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly
given the current state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a
conventional war in Ukraine]{.underline}." [Putin's references to
potential nuclear war serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's
limited economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's a
tactic the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline} since first
invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the former core
of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power." The method
has worked to some degree, most visibly by [isolating Germany from its
traditional ironclad allies in the
West](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-09-13/ukraine-chides-germany-for-inaction-as-it-routs-russian-forces)
due to Berlin's protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid
to Ukraine's military. And it has effectively raised concern among
experts who specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be
dangerous to assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says
Jon Wolfsthal, a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group
Global Zero and a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which
annually publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of
nuclear war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United
States Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in
deterrence does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the
lessons of history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is
fragile and can fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on
Putin grow, the concern is that he will not think clearly or may put
more emphasis on survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on
alliances or friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to [90
seconds to
midnight](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-01-24/doomsday-clock-moves-to-90-seconds-to-midnight-as-nuclear-threat-rises)
in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical annihilation,
than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear war from
Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease and climate
volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds that the
primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia -- chiefly
economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin takes
seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war crimes and
is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with a number
of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says. "If there
is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's possible use
of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not been visibly
communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates." Others believe
that [Putin's most ferocious nuclear rhetoric]{.underline} mostly
[exposes the extent to which the embattled Russian leader feels
**desperate** for new sources of **leverage**]{.underline}. They suggest
that leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden
announcement that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START
treaty, the last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and
Russia. "What [this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says
John Erath, a former top National Security Council official for European
affairs, now senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, Russia's
other sources of influence are **rapidly dwindling**]{.underline} or,
more surprisingly, are now exposed as ineffectual. European countries
that previously relied heavily on flows of Russian energy --
particularly natural gas -- have defied expectations and survived winter
so far without supplies from Moscow. The [endemic rot of
corruption](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-08-31/how-russian-corruption-is-foiling-putins-army-in-ukraine)
within its Ministry of Defense has become widely exposed. Its
conventional military has suffered a string of [embarrassing defeats on
the
battlefield](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/putin-forced-to-address-embarrassing-failures-in-russias-conscription-process),
including during [the beginning of an ongoing
offensive](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2023-02-16/russian-offensive-in-ukraine-begins-with-series-of-failures)
that Russia believed would shift momentum in its favor. The Institute
for the Study of War, like several other private intelligence firms,
believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more as an information
operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's partners in Europe
from providing additional military aid that could be considered
escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated tanks. He has
had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy to provide
Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to remain off the
table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly zone, which
Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit Russia's
ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from the skies.
And while American officials publicly say the course of the war is up to
the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the suggestion that
Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Russia in
2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of providing
weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What Putin also has
in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of some key figures
in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed their perspective
on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent years. With Moscow
once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and more recently
viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an empire by force
at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of Trump finds itself
with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army engaged in a ground
war and being routed by a foreign army without the loss of a single
American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of the commitment.
What that means in the course of a presidential campaign that
prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, [where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons
use](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2022-06-27/pentagon-blasts-putins-cavalier-nuclear-saber-rattling-as-russia-seeks-new-advantages-in-ukraine).
[Within Russia, the **war is not popular**]{.underline}, though polling
suggests Putin has not yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary
Russians. Still, [reports emerge regularly about the lack of confidence
Russian troops have in their leaders up the chain of
command]{.underline} -- leading some analysts to even speculate whether
generals charged with executing nuclear launch orders would [comply with
their
directives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-putin-orders-a-nuke-will-his-generals-obey/2022/10/19/b5ecd7f4-4f6b-11ed-ada8-04e6e6bf8b19_story.html).
[Using nuclear weapons also **wouldn't achieve Putin's battlefield
aims**. Russian military doctrine calls for the use of low-yield nuclear
warheads as a last-ditch tactic]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
Russian forces are **utterly degraded**, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then factor in NATO retaliation for violating the nuclear
taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile strikes on
Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage facilities within
Ukraine," she says. "[You've just **lost** the operational advantage you
might have gained by using low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} --
even if you use 10 or 15." This scenario, however, exists within Russian
offensive operations. Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if
Russia feels it is squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent
"all-out disaster." "[You have to think about the human response to
nuclear use]{.underline}," she says, describing the effect on a
Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a rising mushroom cloud several miles
away toward the front lines. "[The symbolism is really important in that
the Russians may assume it would have a devastating effect on the
morale]{.underline} of the surviving Ukrainian forces," Lawlor says.
["At this stage in the war, though, it's not even under consideration
because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations]{.underline}." At least some of those who have engaged with
Putin directly agree. Former Prime Minister [Boris Johnson]{.underline}
revealed earlier this month that he had received direct warnings from
Putin of nuclear war. "He threatened me at one point, and he said,
\'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only
take a minute,\' or something like that. Jolly," the conservative
politician [told](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64397745) the BBC.
[Johnson]{.underline} later explained to Fox News that he believed that
what Putin was "trying to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to
a story about a nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [argued
that **Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if
it were to launch nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

[The downturn in relations between the West and Russia]{.underline} in
recent years, which some describe as a new Cold War (Legvold, 2016),
[has led to]{.underline} **[renewed concern]{.underline}** [about the
possibility of major war]{.underline} in Europe. Since the conflict over
Ukraine in 2014, most of the institutional ties between the West and
Russia that were put in place in the 1990s and 2000s have been frozen or
abandoned, the United States and the European Union (EU) have imposed
financial and other sanctions on Russia, and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Russia have intensified military deployments and
planning for a possible war with one another. [Russian and Western
military activities have resulted in a significant increase in close
military encounters]{.underline} in the air and at sea, which analysts
fear could trigger an unintended conflict (Frear et al., 2014; Raynova
and Kulesa, 2018). Some observers have warned of scenarios involving war
between Russia and NATO which could escalate to the use of nuclear
weapons (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2016; Shirreff, 2016).
[Drawing on the **growing literature**]{.underline} [on the conditions
of peace between states]{.underline}, as well as Gaddis' Cold War long
peace thesis (Gaddis, 1986, 1991), [this article assesses the prospects
for war and peace]{.underline} between Russia and the West in Europe in
the 2020s and beyond. The first section of the article reviews the
literature on the sources of peace between states, identifying those
factors most relevant to contemporary Western-Russian relations in
Europe. The next section shows how the contested nature of Europe's
post-Cold War order has created an enduring source of tensions and
potential conflict between the West and Russia. The following sections
examine three factors that I argue make [war between the West and Russia
in Europe unlikely:]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[contemporary
European balance of power]{.underline}**, [which is best characterised
as]{.underline} [modified bipolarity]{.underline} and [has]{.underline}
important **[stabilising consequences]{.underline}**; [the
continuing]{.underline} **[pacifying impact]{.underline}** [of nuclear
weapons; and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[energy
relationship]{.underline}** [between Russia and the West,
which]{.underline} [is best understood as one of
**interdependence**]{.underline} (rather than simple Western dependence
on Russia). Combined with two things that have not changed --
[the]{.underline} **[deterrent impact]{.underline}** [of the
likely]{.underline} [consequences of **any extended conventional
war**]{.underline} [and the **reduced risk**]{.underline} [of surprise
or pre-emptive attack arising from the development of **reconnaissance
satellites**]{.underline} -- [these factors are **significant forces**
likely to **impose caution** on Russian and Western leaders and thus act
as]{.underline} [important]{.underline} **[bulwarks against the
risk]{.underline}** [of war between Russia and the West.]{.underline}
This article also examines Western and Russian behaviour in crises
involving the use of force since the end of the Cold War, showing that,
[**despite** divergent positions]{.underline} [and resulting
tensions]{.underline}, [there have also been]{.underline} **[important
elements of restraint]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[mutual
communication]{.underline}** [by both the West and Russia in such
crises]{.underline} -- [suggesting that both sides are **aware of the
risks**]{.underline} [of escalation and have **taken steps to avoid
war**]{.underline}. The possibility of war between Russia and the West
in Europe should not be entirely discounted and governments should work
to maintain channels of communication and establish confidence-building
measures (European Leadership Network, 2020). Nonetheless, [despite the
serious downturn in Russo-Western relations]{.underline} in recent
years, [one can be]{.underline} cautiously **[optimistic]{.underline}**
[that the long peace between Russia and the West in Europe **will
continue.**]{.underline}

### China War

#### China war [is on the brink]{.underline}---nations are preparing now

**Smith, writer for The Daily Express, 25**

\[Daniel, "WW3 on horizon after Trump orders Australia and Japan to get
ready for war with China", The Daily Express, 7-15-25, WW3 on horizon
after Trump orders Australia and Japan to get ready for war with China,
DOA: 7-15-25, HDCSW - J\$\]

[The US has reportedly urged Pacific allies to prepare for **potential
conflict with China over Taiwan**, as Japan signals the dawn of a \'new
crisis era\' and **Beijing appears to be ramping up its military
technology investments.**]{.underline}

Taiwan is viewed by China as a breakaway province, claiming sovereignty
over the island despite its independent democratic government, which is
recognized globally.

[Tensions have escalated since late 2020 due to China\'s \'grey zone
tactics\', including intensified military drills near Taiwan and an
increase in Chinese military aircraft and naval presence in the
area.]{.underline}

While the US has historically pledged support for Taiwan through
military, economic, and diplomatic means, this stance wavered under
President Donald Trump.

A recent Financial Times report suggests that the US remains committed
to defending Taiwan but expects regional allies like Japan and Australia
to be prepared to share the burden in the event of war, reports the
Mirror US.

[The US is pushing]{.underline} these [nations to boost defense spending
as a countermeasure against any aggressive actions from
China.]{.underline}

An unnamed US official emphasized: \"We do not seek war. Nor do we seek
to dominate China itself. What we are doing is ensuring the United
States and its allies have the military strength to underwrite diplomacy
and guarantee peace.

\"We are coming to our allies in the Indo-Pacific, very similar to what
the president did in Europe, and saying this is the threat environment.

\"Obviously, some of these are tough conversations, including on defense
spending. But we think it will leave us all in a better place.\"

[Japan this week issued stern warnings regarding China\'s rapid
escalation of military operations across vast territories stretching
from its southwestern shores to the Pacific]{.underline}, characterizing
these actions as the most significant strategic challenge.

[Beijing\'s expanding collaborative efforts with Russia also present
grave security risks]{.underline} to Japan, alongside mounting tensions
surrounding Taiwan and dangers emanating from North Korea, according to
the Defense Ministry\'s annual military assessment delivered to the
Cabinet on Tuesday.

#### Impact---China-Taiwan war could escalate to US-China nuclear confrontation

**Matthew Wallin, CEO of American Security Project, May 12, 2025** "Is
the Arctic Destined to be the Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear
War?"American Security Project, accessed at
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/

\<Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising.

[The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power.]{.underline} Though he has not signaled any specific intent to
attack, [President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be [capable of
invading

2027]{.underline}. While President Biden [indicated his intention to
directly aid
Taiwan](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-us-forces-would-defend-taiwan-event-chinese-invasion-2022-09-18/) if
this occurred, President [Trump appears to defer to the
traditional [American position of strategic
ambiguity](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-china-taiwan-us-defense-2056293)]{.underline} over
the island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to
defend Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a
nuclear weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S.
mainland or a NATO ally. On the other hand, [a subsequent attack on
Chinese mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.\>]{.underline}
