**[[Benefit sharing agreements and funds]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if
well-designed, can **[[support Indigenous well-being and self
determination.]{.underline}]{.mark}** They can [[set Indigenous
communities on]{.mark} a [path of sustainable
development]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[help]{.mark} [reduce the regional
inequalities]{.mark} that are all [too often apparent among Indigenous
and non-Indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But the extent
to which benefit sharing agreements and funds deliver robust results for
Indigenous peoples differs considerably. Much comes down to the nature
of the benefits and ownership regimes and how they are implemented.

Agreements and funds are often established at the onset of a resource
development or extraction process and set-out a financial or working
relationship that spans across its lifetime. [Benefits may include
payments, profit sharing, local hiring, skills development, education,
cultural support and environmental protection and
remediation.]{.underline}

From the perspective of Indigenous communities[, **[benefit sharing
agreements can establish a clear process for engagement between the
community and development proponents]{.underline}**]{.mark} wherein
development proceeds in line with informed community consent and rights
and interests are respected including environmental and cultural rights
and protections.5 From the perspective of a development proponent,
[[benefit sharing agreements establish]{.underline}]{.mark} a social
license to operate; they outline [[clear processes]{.mark} of engagement
and as such, [reduce]{.mark} project [risk through economic
certainty]{.mark}, [predictable timelines,]{.mark} [reputational
protection]{.mark} and cost management guarantees]{.underline}. Beyond
this, many companies increasingly understand the importance of
supporting regional development more broadly. While benefit sharing
agreements can lead to positive outcomes, they also have drawbacks.
Indigenous communities may feel pressured to sign agreements because
they have no actual control or veto over developments on their
traditional territories and the benefits that they receive may
compensate little for the negative impacts of resource developments.
This section outlines different types of benefit sharing agreements and
funds and the ways in which **[[they can contribute to community
economic development and strengthen Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Benefit sharing is a mechanism that will strengthen indigenous finances

**[[Indigenous entrepreneurs commonly report a lack of access to
finance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The reasons for this may differ. In some
cases, businesses may face barriers due to a lack of
knowledge/understanding of their businesses and the markets they serve,
limited collateral and credit history, and lack of expertise with
regards to business planning and producing financial statements; in
others cases lenders may view the inclusion of broader social and
economic development goals as overly complex.

Collateral [for business loans can be more challenging to access because
in some jurisdictions [Indigenous]{.mark} [peoples]{.mark} living in
traditional settlement areas [do not i]{.mark}ndividually [own their
land or home]{.mark}.]{.underline}35 Historical dependency on government
transfers for housing and income has also resulted in a weak credit
history, which makes it difficult for institutions to make an assessment
of risks related to investment or finance. [[This makes it harder to
secure funding]{.mark} but can also lead to a higher rate of interest on
loans to offset the perceived higher ris]{.underline}k. Discrimination
and cultural bias can result in lenders or investors being unwilling to
even consider funding Indigenous communities or individuals.

[Businesses in [remote areas]{.mark} can [face]{.mark} additional
[challenges because]{.mark} there may be [a lack of]{.mark} similar
[proposals or investments]{.mark} for institutions [to benchmark
against]{.mark}, returns tend to be smaller than in urban
places,]{.underline} and there may be a lack of local financial
institutions that have the local knowledge to effectively assess a
proposal. With the exception of tourism (where a market is brought to a
place), remote rural entrepreneurship tends to focus on natural
resources including forestry, minerals, hydrocarbons, renewable energy,
fishing and aquaculture. Many of these industries are capital intensive
and require large long-term investments before gains are realised.

While the private sector banking is showing growing interest in serving
Indigenous banking needs, lending gaps remain, particularly for small
rural Indigenous businesses.36 **[Ongoing [efforts are needed to
strengthen access to finance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Governments can
address these market imperfections by [**[providing targeted financial
instruments for Indigenous businesses at different sizes]{.mark}** and
at different points in the business growth lifecycle]{.underline}
(start-up phase, a period of growth and financing, succession, and
disposal). Governments in Australia, Canada and the United States all
provide different financial instruments, mainly loan facilities, [[**to
address needs at different points of this cycle**]{.underline}
(]{.mark}OECD, 2019\[4\]). This support may entail a mix of grants and
loans, and loan guarantees where the loans are provided by mainstream
banks and backed by government guarantees[. **[These facilitate more
affordable borrowing rates and enable entrepreneurs to build their
equity share, and if the business is successful, enables them to access
further finance]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Loan provision may further
include flexible repayment schedules (e.g. accounting for seasonal
conditions), no interest loan periods, lower requirements for capital
contributions, and the direct provision of public capital.

#### Australia proves that benefit sharing allows for community empowerment in resource decision making

Hill et al.'s (2012\[38\]) typology of Indigenous engagement in
**[[Australian environmental management]{.mark} usefully [outlines
power, sharing, participation and intercultural purpose]{.mark} across
[a range of governance types]{.mark}---[from Indigenous-governed
collaborations]{.mark} [and Indigenous-driven co-governance]{.mark} to
[agency-driven cogovernance and agency
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}.** Control over decision making may rest
with a high degree of Indigenous control on the one hand, or relegate it
to a form of consultation (input) where power rests with a government
agency. While [this typology is derived from a particular analysis of
Australia's environmental management system, [it bears relevance
to]{.mark} many other elements of [public
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} such as social care or education.
A key point is that community empowerment over decision-making is shaped
by these institutional contexts. **[In recent years[, benefit sharing
agreements]{.mark} have [increasingly embraced community
decision-making]{.mark} by, for example, [establishing an environmental
committee]{.mark} constituted [by local community members]{.mark} whose
function is to assess the environmental impact of a development and
recommend action]{.underline}** (Loutit, Mandelbaum and Szoke-Burke,
2016\[39\]).

among]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[energy companies, government, and
Indigenous communitie]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[s]{.mark}**[. In theory,
the partnership mode is **better** positioned for promoting
**development and self-reliance in the Indigenous
communitie**]{.underline}**s**. Such [partnerships have been a
characteristic of oil extraction on the Sakhalin Island.]{.underline}
Sakhalin Energy and Exxon Neftegaz Limited operating in the region
developed partnerships with the regional state and Indigenous peoples
through tripartite agreements, which set up procedures for distributing
funds to Indigenous communities, organizations, and family enterprises
\[29[\]. The success of benefit sharing practices in the two cases in
highly dependent on the corporate policies and on whether loans from
global investment institutions were received \[]{.underline}15\].

[**[Sakhalin Energy]{.underline}**,]{.mark} through loans and
investments[, **[is influenced by]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[standards
of international financial institutions]{.mark} (such as the **World
Bank and the International Finance Corporation)**]{.underline} in
respect to dealing with the environment and Indigenous people.
[[Sakhalin Energy adopted]{.underline}]{.mark} global standards,
including [[free prior and informed consent]{.underline},]{.mark} and
annual third party evaluations \[15[**\]. [The company's Indigenous
Minorities Development Plan includes]{.mark}** [the participation of
**Indigenous people** in decisions]{.mark} about [allocating]{.mark}
grant [funding to NGOs]{.mark} [and indigenous family
enterprises]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Although this approach was
initially popular, [it generated tensions and conflicts among community
members around the distribution of funds.]{.underline}

[**[Exxon]{.mark}** Neftegaz Limited **[was not significantly
influenced]{.mark}** by international financial institutions. [The
**benefit sharing** arrangement i**ncorporated grant funding**]{.mark}
**available to communities where drilling occurred, [but not for]{.mark}
other [island communities.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Implementing benefit
sharing programs at a smaller scale than Sakhalin Energy \[29\],
**[Exxon distributed funds only to organizations, not individual
households]{.underline}.** [Indigenous residents also receive occasional
employment from oil companies**. B**]{.underline}**oth** benefit sharing
**policies** utilized the investment mechanism (e.g., Sakhalin Energy's
"development plan"), that is **not designed to directly address or
compensate the damages (environmental degradation and cultural losses)
suffered because of oil extraction.** [More so, the partnerships exclude
non-Indigenous local stakeholders, who remain outside of the current
benefit sharing arrangements.]{.underline}

#### Benefit sharing regimes are already [extremely]{.underline} successful in the Arctic.

https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/3/155?utm_source) //ishi *3.1. Benefit
Sharing Regimes*

[A benefit sharing regime can be defined as a system of relationships,
principles, procedures and actions, formal and informal, that describe
benefit sharing arrangements and processes in a given region, community
or specific extractive project]{.underline}. [Each benefit sharing
regime is]{.underline} complex and embedded in national and local
practices, traditions, legacies, power relations, [degrees of
indigenous, and local people's empowerment, as well as in company
management, ownership, level of internationalization, etc.]{.underline}
We propose to consider benefit sharing regimes by examining their key
components (**Table 1**), which together describe prevalent benefit
sharing arrangements and processes.

\[TABLE OMITTED\]

*3.2. Benefit Sharing Principles*

Benefit sharing principles are the foundational principles of benefit
sharing that define the nature of the benefits (**Table 2**). In other
words, a principle formulates the logic under which the benefits exist.
The [principle of compensation implies that the benefits are distributed
to compensate for a past or future damage or loss of value resulting
from extractive activity]{.underline}. [This could be a compensation for
land, pollution, loss of access to resources, etc. In either case, the
benefit is a compensation by an extractive company designed to "pay for"
the negative consequences of their operation]{.underline}. This
principle most often entails environmental and socio-economic assessment
of impacts, which are then monetized. The targets and mechanisms of
benefit sharing under this principle vary, but most typically once the
assessment is completed[, a compensation is a one-way process, where a
company dispenses the payment and, to an extent, absolves itself from
further responsibilities, while a community (or a household) is left to
identify the best use of the received benefit to alleviate the
damage.]{.underline}

In contrast, [investment as a benefit sharing principle aims to support
or stimulate current and future activities, capacities and opportunities
in a community affected by extractive activities.]{.underline} It
targets the priorities identified by the receiving party or negotiated
with the company (and sometimes the government[). It may include
payments, but also investment in training and education, developing
infrastructure, providing employment opportunities for the residents,
contracting local businesses, etc.]{.underline} Metaphorically speaking,
this principle [of benefit sharing focuses on giving "a fishing rod
instead of a fish".]{.underline} This principle thus empowers local
communities and possesses considerable procedural equity. However, it
also can take paternalistic forms when a company substitutes the state
by investing in infrastructure and local services.

Another principle of benefit sharing is charity. The charity principle
is based on the assumption that an extractive company has no fundamental
obligation to provide any benefits, but it chooses to share some profits
as a matter of philanthropy and good will. This principle implies little
procedural or distributional equity and may serve as a self-promotion
mechanism for a developer to earn the SLO.

\[TABLE OMITTED\]

*3.3. Modes of Benefit Sharing*

Modes of [benefit sharing characterize the types of interaction between
an extractive industry and indigenous/local communities that result in
institutionalized benefit distribution arrangements and
practices.]{.underline} Each mode gives particular roles to certain
actors (e.g., state, company, community) and employs various mechanisms
to accomplish benefit sharing. Modes can be built on single or multiple
benefit sharing principles. Modes are also mixed and can change over
time. In practice, however, one mode typically dominates. Previous
studies developed a classification of benefit sharing modes existing in
the Arctic \[**5**,**31**,**32**\] and identified paternalistic,
[company centered social responsibility (CCSR) partnership, beneficiary,
and shareholder modes.]{.underline}

Under the paternalistic mode the state takes [the dominating role in
defining and distributing the benefits. It dictates, monitors, and
intervenes in companies' policies and practices towards
communities.]{.underline} Frequently, an extractive company takes the
role of the state or contributes significantly to some elements of state
support to local communities and indigenous peoples. Paternalism,
especially prevalent in the Russian Arctic, results partly from the
failure of the state to provide sufficient services to remote
communities and strong pressure on both private and public corporations
to support local infrastructure and welfare. In these cases, the state
identifies and negotiates with companies the community needs, and by
doing so, closes the gaps in its own budget. In Russia, negotiations
between governments and companies represent a long-standing practice,
partly rooted in Soviet type of interactions
\[**3**,**16**,**17**,**30**\]. In other contexts, e.g., [in Alaska's
North Slope, a municipal government takes a paternalistic stance
fulfilling its role in welfare provision implemented in a top-down
manner. Therefore, the paternalistic mode of benefit sharing eschews
stakeholder engagement, disembowels both local communities, and
indigenous peoples]{.underline} \[**29**\].

CCSR represents a mode where a company plays the central role in setting
benefit sharing arrangements by adopting globally developed standards,
standards of various international organizations, funding agencies or
legislation. It is primarily designed to please the investors and
shareholders and to earn the SLO. A company's contributions to local
communities under this mode often take the form of compensation or
targeted investments. However, [the leading role in benefit sharing (and
thus, the power) is retained by the company, and in many ways the
interest of the company prevails over community needs and
desires.]{.underline}

The partnership mode is often based on a tripartite partnership among
the extractive companies, government, and indigenous communities.
Partnership implies a mutually empowering process with relatively high
procedural equity. The partnership mode is found in the Sakhalin Island,
Russia \[**3**,**12**,**33**\] and in Alaska, among others; where state,
companies, and local rights-holders (indigenous organizations/Native
corporations) make joint decisions and coordinate activities on both the
business (e.g., subcontracting to Native corporations) and community
side (e.g., coordinate hunting, gathering, fishing). The partnership
mode is well positioned to generate a targeted and concerted investment
in local capacities, infrastructure and businesses and thus promote
development and self-reliance in the indigenous/local communities.

The beneficiary mode of benefit sharing establishes community-oriented
beneficiary organizations that act as non-profit corporations to run
community services, businesses, and civic institutions. These
corporations negotiate and receive benefits from extractive companies
and then invest in local or extraterritorial businesses, ventures, and
financial markets. Revenues are usually administered through community
funds, but distribution payments are possible on an equal basis to all
beneficiaries. This mode is dominant in the Canadian Arctic.

[The shareholder mode involves dividend funds and shares from for-profit
regional and village indigenous corporations. Indigenous shareholders
receive dividend payments. Native corporations contract with extractive
companies and receive royalties from extraction on the indigenous-owned
land or subsoil rights to resources and distribute them between
indigenous shareholders]{.underline}. [This mode is unique to Alaska;
where, for example, the indigenous residents of the North Slope are
almost always shareholders of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and
usually hold shares in one of the village corporations, thus receiving
shares (and dividends) from both.]{.underline}

### No Inherency\-\--Natives say no

#### Indigenous peoples are against resource and mineral extraction, environmental consequences

**Kehoe 25**\[Aisha Kehoe, Based in Beirut, Aisha Kehoe Down joined the
Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) in 2018 and is
an investigative reporter who has covered stories around the world,
including in Africa and the Middle East, 16 Apr 2025, "'Protect our
future': Alaskan Indigenous town fights 'destructive' uranium mine
project", The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/uranium-mine-elim-alaska-trump?\]//sax

For generations, the people of Elim have subsisted off the forests and
waters of north-west Alaska: hunting caribou and bearded seals in the
late winter, gathering bird eggs and wild greens from the tundra in
early spring, and fishing the salmon run in the late summer. The Iñupiat
community of 350 people lives on one of the state's most productive and
biodiverse fisheries, an inlet of the Bering Sea called the Norton
Sound. They refer to their land as Munaaquestevut, or "the one who cares
for us". "[We depend on the land to put food on the table, to keep our
tribe healthy. We have a subsistence economy with a cash overlay," said
Emily Murray, a resident of Elim and vice-president of Norton Bay
Watershed Council, a non-profit tribal organization focused on regional
water quality."We've been doing this for generations upon generations."
Now, an intensifying global competition for critical minerals and the
priorities of a new administration threaten to put their land, their
fishery and their lives at risk, members of the community
say.]{.underline} This summer, the Canadian mining company Panther
Minerals is set to start exploration for a uranium mine at the
headwaters of the Tubuktulik river, adjacent to Elim's land. David
Hedderly-Smith, a consultant to Panther and the owner of mining claims
for the property, has said the site could become the "uranium capital of
America". The people of Elim have opposed the mine since last May, when
Panther Minerals announced its intention to apply for exploration
permits. In interviews, they said they feared for their health, and
spoke of the cancer and contamination that followed uranium mining on
Navajo land in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. "[If \[the river\] becomes
contaminated, it will have an impact on the whole Bering
Sea]{.underline}. That's the way I see it," said Johnny Jemewouk, a
resident of Elim. [Last summer, the Bureau of Land Management, which
manages a small portion of the claim, verified and accepted Panther
Minerals' exploration notice and signed off on the bonding process to
proceed]{.underline}. In December, a regional tribal consortium passed a
resolution "categorically" opposing the mine. However, Alaska's
department of natural resources (DNR), which manages most of the land,
has so far refused Elim's requests for a consultation -- and brushed
aside over a hundred comments from the community over plans for the
mine. In October, they granted Panther Minerals a four-year exploration
permit, which will allow the company to start drilling wells and taking
uranium core samples this June. Elim has appealed against the permit.
But with time running out, the community has gone one step further,
protesting against the mine using the largest international forum
available to them: the Iditarod, Alaska's grueling annual sled dog race,
which passes through their village on its way to Nome. As musher Jesse
Holmes approached Elim's checkpoint and the 1,008th mile of the race,
more than 70 students and community members waited for him in the Arctic
night. They [held signs saying "Protect our future", and "Keep the
uranium in the ground." It was their chance to tell the world what their
way of life means to them]{.underline}. "I want to protect our future,"
said Paige Keith, an eighth-grader from Elim. "If they go through with
this, it's going to affect our animals and our water. I want to help try
to stop the mine."As global competition for critical minerals
intensifies, the Trump administration is eyeing Alaska. An executive
order issued on Trump's first day in office calls on the US to "fully
avail itself of Alaska's vast lands and resources". [The order was
applauded by the state's mining industry.The order reversed a number of
Biden-era protections for Alaskan land, opening oil and gas drilling in
the Arctic national wildlife refuge and ending restrictions on
logging.]{.underline} Several of these reversals put the administration
at cross purposes with the Native communities that subsist off Alaska's
land. For example, one of them enables plans for a mining access road in
Alaska's Brooks Range, which a tribal network has called "one of the
biggest and most destructive" projects in the state's dhistory. "We're
in an age of green transition. We're looking for other forms of energy.
And, with the new administration, there is this push to mine
domestically," said Jasmine Jemewouk, an activist from Elim. "It's a
race for resources and they're looking at Alaska."The coming years are
likely to see continued conflicts between Alaska's powerful mining
industry and Native communities -- especially as the US seeks to onshore
its critical mineral supply chain. And while Panther Minerals'
exploration permit is up to the state of Alaska, and not the federal
government, advocates and community members said the Trump
administration may further embolden Alaska's DNR to brush aside Elim's
concerns. [Alaska's governor, Mike Dunleavy, has welcomed Trump's
executive orders, saying: "Happy days are here again." "The current
administration in Alaska is very industrial extraction driven," said Hal
Shepherd, an attorney and water rights advocate based in Homer, Alaska.
"Trump and Dunleavy basically are partners in developing
Alaska.]{.underline}

#### Mining and extraction goes against Indigenous views, they say no to the plan. 

**Bowe & Manning 25**\[Rebecca Bowe & Elizabeth Manning, Public Affairs
and Communications Officer, June 4, 2025, Mining Makes No Sense to the
Southwest Alaska Tribes Challenging the Donlin Gold Mine, EarthJustice,
https://earthjustice.org/feature/donlin-gold-mine-alaska-tribes?utm_source=chatgpt.com\]//sax

In late February, three Alaska Native leaders traveled thousands of
miles from snowy Southwest Alaska to Eugene, Oregon, to present
alongside Earthjustice attorneys at the Public Interest Environmental
Law Conference (PIELC). [There, they spoke out against the proposed
Donlin Gold Mine, a massive project planned in their region near the
Kuskokwim River]{.underline}.If built, Donlin Mine would reportedly be
the largest gold mine in the world, producing about 30 million ounces of
gold over the 27-year-life of the mine. [It would also, Alaska Native
leaders say, pose an existential threat to their Tribes' food security
and cultural traditions.]{.underline} The trip down to the conference
took two full days and four flights for William Igkurak, Council
President of the Native Village of Kwigillingok. His village, home to
fewer than 500 people, is located on the Bering Sea coast near the mouth
of the Kuskokwim River. The trip for the other two Alaska Native
leaders, Walter Jim, Jr., Chair of the Orutsararmiut Native Council
(ONC), and Ray Watson, an ONC Council Member, also involved multiple
flights. Bethel, a village hub with a population of about 6,000 people,
is similarly remote, located along the Kuskokwim River about 400 miles
west of Anchorage with no roads connecting it to other parts of Alaska.
All three leaders said it was important for them to make the long trip
from their villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta to talk to a packed
room of lawyers, law students, and others because they want people
outside of Alaska to understand what their communities stand to lose if
the mine project moves forward. "[You can't eat gold," Igkurak said
during an interview following the presentation.The tribal leaders say
that long after the mine closes, it would pose grave risks to the
region's lands, waters, fish, wildlife and birds --- and to tribal
members' subsistence ways of life that have persisted thousands of years
and are central to their continued wellbeing.]{.underline} "Anything
manmade is not guaranteed to last," Igkurak said. [All three tribal
leaders talked about how, over time, the mine's infrastructure would
require repairs and could fail. The mine would operate for less than 30
years, a blink of time, while what matters most to them is preserving
the lands, waters, and natural resources for future generations. Also of
concern is the tripling of barge traffic expected if the mine is
built.]{.underline} Already, the Kuskokwim River's banks are eroding due
to permafrost melting and other changes caused by climate change. More
barges on the river will cause even more damage to the river's banks,
threats to fish they depend on, like rainbow smelt, and would make
fishing more difficult, they said. ["It's driven by greed," said Jim,
ONC's Chair. "Short-term gratification, money. But in the end, it's the
livelihood of our people that is really at the forefront of what we're
doing here" to fight this mine.]{.underline} It sounds like Igkurak is
making a joke, but he's not. As tribal leaders for their communities,
protecting subsistence is one of their most serious responsibilities.
The three leaders explained that hunting, fishing and gathering wild
food means food security and that these subsistence practices form the
basis for the whole life and culture of their communities. [Gold mining,
on the other hand, even if it makes a profit for some, makes no sense in
their world view. "Mining is not even in our culture," added Watson, a
council member of the Bethel tribe Orutsararmiut Native Council (ONC),
who over the years has held many different tribal leadership roles.
"You're not supposed to disturb what is there... that makes the
ancestors mad." Most tribes in the region oppose the project, arguing
its long-term risks far outweigh any short-term gains like jobs for some
people in the region.The tribal leaders say that long after the mine
closes, it would pose grave risks to the region's lands, waters, fish,
wildlife and birds --- and to tribal members' subsistence ways of life
that have persisted thousands of years and are central to their
continued wellbeing.]{.underline} "Anything manmade is not guaranteed to
last," Igkurak said. All three tribal leaders talked about how, over
time, the mine's infrastructure would require repairs and could fail.
The mine would operate for less than 30 years, a blink of time, while
what matters most to them is preserving the lands, waters, and natural
resources for future generations. Also of concern is the tripling of

River's banks are eroding due to permafrost melting and other changes
caused by climate change. More barges on the river will cause even more
damage to the river's banks, threats to fish they depend on, like
rainbow smelt, and would make fishing more difficult, they said. "It's
driven by greed," said Jim, ONC's Chair. "Short-term gratification,
money. But in the end, it's the livelihood of our people that is really
at the forefront of what we're doing here" to fight this mine.

Coastal areas of the Arctic and Subarctic are vulnerable to accidental
oil spills, impacting the ecosystem, society, and economy. This article
provides a comprehensive overview of [oil spill pollution issues in cold
regions, focusing on environmental impacts, oil transport and fate,
coastal/shoreline response measures, and the state of current
international policies and regulations]{.underline}. [Numerous studies
have described the potential effects of oil pollution (crude oil and
refined products) on wildlife (invertebrates, fish, birds, and marine
mammals) and coastal communities within the Arctic and Subarctic
regions]{.underline}. The observed detrimental effects are influenced by
the oil fate and transport processes, including physiochemical
attenuation and biodegradation, natural dissolution/dispersion following
point-source release (surface and subsurface), entrainment by sea ice,
and stranding onto shorelines (in which the residual oil may be
translocated). Measures such as natural attenuation, bioremediation,
manual removal, in situ burning, and washing/flooding are available for
spill response in coastal regions. Case studies in cold regions are
illustrated for a better analysis of practical response methods,
implying that [shoreline cleanup operations in the Arctic and Subarctic
are more challenging than those in more temperate and populated regions
because of **environmental and logistical challenges**.]{.underline}
Regarding preparedness, a number of national and international policies,
regulations, and guidelines have been established to advance oil spill
prevention and response measures within the Arctic and Subarctic
regions. Based on the state of knowledge presented in this review,
recommendations are made for future research on oil spill pollution in
coastal regions of the Arctic and Subarctic.

[Oil spill response operations in Arctic and Subarctic regions are
**considerably more challenging** with the constraints linked to harsh
weather conditions]{.underline}, infrastructure inaccessibility, and
remote locations (API, 2012; National Research Council et al., 2014).
Therefore, the spilled oil may eventually be deposited on shorelines
(Feng et al., 2022; Góngora et al., 2022), which may have long-term
impacts on wildlife and coastal communities\' health and socioeconomic
conditions. To improve oil spill response preparedness, particular
consideration has been given to the modification of existing or the
development of new cleanup strategies for some sensitive shorelines
(e.g., tundra and peat shores) and oily snow and ice waste (Owens,
2014). Many countries, including the United States, Canada, Norway, and
Russia, have territories within the Arctic, and international
coordination in these regions has proven beneficial in numerous
instances for ensuring efficient and effective containment and cleanup
efforts to minimize the impact of oil spills. Thus, international
organizations, such as the Arctic Council and International Maritime
Organization, have established agreements, regulations, and operational
guidelines to enhance global capability and capacity to respond to oil
spills within the Arctic and Subarctic regions (Koivurova et al., 2020).

[Spilled oil in Arctic or Subarctic waters does not remain stationary
but is carried by wind and currents (horizontally and vertically), often
covering considerably large areas.]{.underline} Oil will likely reach
shoreline regions or become trapped within sea ice, affecting coastal
wildlife and local communities (Fig. 2), which are highly dependent on
the sustenance and habitat of a healthy ocean.

The Arctic region presents unique challenges for understanding the fate
and transport of spilled oil due to its harsh environmental conditions
and the presence of sea ice. With changes in seasonal meteorological
conditions, [the Arctic can have substantial sea ice on its surface and
shoreline, leading to significant differences in the fate and transport
of oil spills]{.underline}. Differences in geomorphology must also be
considered, such as permafrost. [The transport and fate of oil spills in
the Arctic coastal environment are highly dependent on the nature of the
oil, environmental conditions, and the physicochemical and biological
processes]{.underline} (Fig. 3).

#### Oil spill mitigation techniques are costly and can harm the environment

After thousands of gallons of oil poured into the Pacific Ocean
following the October 2nd spill, agencies and volunteers have worked
around the clock to mitigate the damage and stop the spread. To do this,
crews have employed booms, physical floating barriers that help contain
the oil from extending outward. Skimmers are then used within the
perimeter of the boom to remove the oil from the water before soaking it
up with a sand-like mixture. The current spill is just one of many over
the past 30 years, and its estimated 24 to 131 thousand gallons is
relatively small compared to the nearly 134 million gallons that
affected the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in
2010. [While booms have been effective in this most recent spill,
[previous]{.mark} larger [spills]{.mark} have [called for additional
mitigation techniques]{.mark} such as the use of dispersants or in situ
burning.]{.underline} After the Deepwater Horizon spill, Carnegie Mellon
Chemical Engineering Professors Shelley Anna and Lynn Walker joined the
Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative's (GoMRI) effort to better
[understand the impact of both the spill and the techniques used to
limit the devastation on wildlife and wetlands]{.underline}. At the
time, Anna and Walker were already developing a tool called a
microtensiometer to measure the interfacial and transport behavior of
surfactants, chemical substances used to create dispersants. When
applied to a liquid, the properties of surfactants reduce surface
tension, enabling them to disperse large oil collections into smaller
droplets. A common household example of this is dish detergent, which
helps break up the grease collected on pots and pan during cooking.
"Dish detergent, like Dawn, is an example of a surfactant that isn't
harmful to skin or feathers, so it's often used to clean the oil off
birds and other wildlife following a spill," said Walker. Not only can
the use of surfactants help prevent oil slicks from forming, but
according to Anna, they also allow oil droplets to be pushed down into
the water column so that natural oil-eating microbes can begin breaking
down the contaminant. As the oil droplets become smaller, their surfaces
become more accessible to these microbes. [[However,]{.mark} even though
the process seems to be a more natural alternative to burning the oil
off the water's surface, Anna says all [mitigation techniques come with
drawbacks and can **significantly impact the ecosystem and
environment**]{.mark}.]{.underline} "When you disperse oil in the ocean,
you also promote the growth of the bacteria that eat it," said Anna.
"For example, if you eat unhealthy food, you change the makeup of your
gut microbiome, and it can have many different long-term direct and
indirect effects. In the case of an oil spill, we have a huge complex
system where you might think it's a good thing that bacteria are eating
the oil, but is it? It is also upsetting the bacterial ecosystem." Anna
and Walker's research also considered more sustainably sourced
surfactants. Their early work characterized rhamnolipids, a surfactant
produced by oil-eating bacteria, and the water-resistant properties of
hydrophobin, a protein found on the surface of mushrooms.
[[While]{.mark} the [alternatives have less environmental impact]{.mark}
than their synthetic counterparts, the [**economic feasibility**
will]{.mark} likely [hinder adoption]{.mark} for this
application.]{.underline} Walker and others are now working on more
efficient ways to incorporate sustainably sourced surfactants in
different applications. According to Allen Robinson, department head of
Carnegie Mellon's Mechanical Engineering department[, the environmental
damage of an oil spill goes far beyond just affecting the ocean's
water.]{.underline} While many people don't realize its massive impact
on air quality and pollution, the oil evaporated following a spill
directly contributes to particulate matter. When oil is burned off the
water's surface, the effects on the atmosphere become even more
significant, as the thick black smoke is evidence of very low-quality
combustion. "[[The solutions]{.mark} that are out there [are]{.mark}
generally [complicated]{.mark}, in the sense that [they have]{.mark} an
[impact in]{.mark} both [negative and positive
ways]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Anna. "[The best solution is to try and
prevent these spills from happening in the first place,]{.underline} so
we don't have to grapple with these types of decisions."

### No Solvency\-\--TK Fails

#### Traditional knowledge [paired with Western science]{.underline} can't solve

into contemporary resource management,\" No Publication,

There is growing recognition of the importance of indigenous peoples\'
knowledge in ensuring the ecological and socio-economic sustainability
of natural resources. This paper will focus on the problems associated
with attempting to integrate indigenous peoples\' knowledge into
dominant State management systems. Within the context of Canadian
resource management, these problems with \'integration\' are in part a
product of how traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is understood by
researchers who attempt to collect and subsequently use this knowledge.
[Problems with how TEK is conceptualized include: 1) TEK research does
not represent all components of indigenous knowledge; 2) TEK is
understood as mere \'data\' which is at risk of being \'lost\'; and 3)
TEK is only considered relevant when validated by Western
science.]{.underline} As a result of these factors, there are also
critical problems that arise when researchers attempt to integrate TEK
into Western resource management. For example, there are problems with:
[1) how TEK is collected and represented; 2) attempts to harmonize
disparate worldviews and incompatible notions; and 3) how TEK is
incorporated into an unchanged Western resource management
system.]{.underline} This paper concludes that there is a much greater
potential to meaningfully incorporate indigenous knowledge into
sustainable resource management when TEK holders have direct involvement
in management processes through community-based, adaptive resource
decision-making institutions.

A decade of research in Canada has attempted to document Aboriginal
peoples\' ecological knowledge to determine how this knowledge has or
could contribute to contemporary sustainable resource management
practices. [This paper will describe the problems associated with how
TEK is currently defined and also with how it is **integrated into
State** resource management systems. TEK research does not represent all
components of indigenous knowledge but rather TEK is understood as mere
\`data\' which is at risk of being \`lost\'.]{.underline} Likewise, TEK
is only considered relevant when validated by Western science. [As a
result of these factors there are also critical problems which arise
when researchers attempt to integrate TEK into Western resource
management]{.underline}. For example, there are problems with how TEK is
collected and represented. [Attempts to harmonize disparate worldviews
and incompatible notions are also problematic.]{.underline} Finally,
there is the fundamental problem of attempting to integrate TEK into an
unchanged Western resource management system. These problems are in part
a product of how traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) 2 is understood
by most non-Aboriginal researchers who attempt to collect and
subsequently use this knowledge. TEK is more than just information; its
transfer into knowledge happens within a different context, informed by
a fundamentally different world view and therefore consists not only of
\`ecological data\' but also of spirituality, values, normative rules
and cultural practices.

Significant operational problems with the way TEK research is conducted
and how Aboriginal knowledge is collected, represented and controlled
are also evident. Stevenson (2000) aptly describes several problems with
the process of TEK research, summarized below:

1\) [problems which TEK is meant to help **\`solve\'** are usually
identified by non-aboriginal people such as biologists, government
employees, resource managers and others trained in the **Western
scientific paradigm;**]{.underline}

2[) the methods or research designs developed to address these problems
almost never originate in the aboriginal communities;]{.underline}

[3) non-aboriginal researchers are often the interpreters, collectors
and managers of TEK owing to a lack of \`capacity\' in aboriginal
communities;]{.underline}

[4) TEK, which exists and is given meaning in an oral context is
translated from its original language into that of the dominant culture
and then transferred into text or map format, which then becomes the
authoritative source or reference, **excluding the people who hold this
knowledge from decision-making**.]{.underline}

Likewise, TEK research presents other important questions such as: who
can use this knowledge?; what use will this knowledge be put to?; and
whom will this knowledge benefit? TEK researchers have noted that these
issues can be addressed by ensuring that the wishes of knowledge
holders, about where and how TEK should be used are protected. In
practice it is difficult to reconcile the underlying issues of authority
and spiritual aspects of knowledge. TEK research which asks knowledge
holders to give their knowledge to outsiders who will then publish this
information in documents or on cartographic maps has the potential
dangerous outcome of shifting the authority over knowledge from elders
to outsiders and documents.

TEK is also created and transferred in a language and cultural context
different from the context which most TEK researchers hold. There are
two main problems with this[. First, transferring information from one
language to another inevitably affects its meaning. Second, the way
knowledge is transferred may vary culturally and much TEK research
requires that knowledge holders breach cultural codes about how and to
whom new knowledge is given.]{.underline} For example, in one community
\"elders were very concerned abut giving away information \...\[and\]
also identified a need to redefine certain words such as
\`management\'\" (Michel 2002:4). TEK holders and elders have
participated in TEK research despite these concerns because they want to
pass on their knowledge to the next generation but opportunities for
knowledge to be passed on traditionally may be decreasing or because
they hope to demonstrate the impact of resource development on their
lands or to secure a place for their communities and knowledge in
decision-making.

TEK researchers are attempting to reconcile these desires with the
problems described by using participatory research methodologies and
trying to [find new ways to document TEK which preserves its oral and
cultural context]{.underline} (for example, video). [It is important to
recognize that even if the research process looks participatory when the
framework used to approach the research is **based on the supremacy of
Western ways of knowing**]{.underline} and systems it can be very
\`disempowering\' and not at all \"useful in contracting the invading
industrial culture that devalues and suppresses the traditional ways of
the community life as ignorance, backwardness, superstition, and
inefficiency\" (Park 1993).

The challenges for both TEK researchers and TEK holders are great and
require that both are committed to creating new methods for research to
ensure that indigenous knowledge, in its entirety, is maintained,
respected and afforded a suitable position.

Climate Change,"Outside,
https://www.outsideonline.com/culture/opinion/indigenous-knowledge-climate-change?scope=anon)

In the past few years, I've become skeptical that academia and
institutions like the IPCC will truly embrace Indigenous peoples, much
less the knowledge that we carry about the natural world. I left a
tenured professor track role because of the inability of academia and
western institutions to meaningfully incorporate Indigenous knowledge.
**[Within academia, Indigenous knowledge is largely only valued when it
confirms the conclusions of western science. When it conflicts or
disagrees with western science it is often discarded or
ignored.]{.underline}**

The Indigenous knowledge that's accepted by academics is often published
in peer reviewed journals, which might as well lock this information in
a vault for the communities providing the information. It is largely
written in inaccessible academic jargon and hidden behind expensive
paywalls. I know because I've published a number of open access journal
articles and sent thousands of dollars to publishers to make
perspectives from my own community accessible.

[**[Indigenous knowledge tends to be localized]{.mark} and holistic,
while [western science's]{.mark} approach [is]{.mark} highly
[specialized]{.mark}, and seeks universal truths.** In many respects
these different orientations can make **[threading these knowledge
systems together is]{.mark} fundamentally
[impossible]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's not surprising that
the global focus on reducing carbon emissions has been characterized by
some academics as "carbon tunnel vision." Responses to climate change
tend to neglect the other elements of this equation, like addressing
biodiversity challenges, environmental toxicity, and the broader
socio-political and cultural changes needed to make solutions feasible.
The most recent IPCC report acknowledges that Indigenous knowledge
systems could help provide the critical framework to bridge these
interconnected challenges. But using the phrase of Kimaren ole Riamit, a
Maasai scholar, these are just "pretty words" on a piece of paper. They
don't mean much without action.

[**[The trust needed]{.mark} to meaningfully incorporate Indigenous
knowledge into policy [doesn't exist]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Building equal
relationships on the heels of hundred years of colonization is not a
quick process, and time is running out. It will take longer to implement
a fully justice-informed approach to the climate crisis than the time we
have to address the worst impacts of climate change**. [We have]{.mark}
already [crossed]{.mark} thresholds of [irreversible impacts for]{.mark}
some [Indigenous peoples.]{.mark} I have seen how the [warming
of]{.mark} the [Arctic has]{.mark} permanently [displaced]{.mark} entire
[villages]{.mark} and [disrupted]{.mark} thousands of years of [cultural
traditions]{.mark} and ways of knowing.**]{.underline} In my home
community, I have witnessed large swaths of rangeland turn to sand dunes
and medicinal plants I once collected move to higher latitudes and
elevations due to warming temperatures and two decades of drought.

A decade ago, these solutions had been categorized emergency measures.
But each year that we fail to address carbon emissions at a meaningful
scale, they become closer to reality.

Take, for example, the U.S. Department of the Interior's list of
minerals critical to economic and national security, which it released
in February. One fundamental piece of a transition to a lower carbon
economy globally will mean a greater level of mining for these critical
minerals and increased pressures to develop supply chains within the
United States and globally. The list includes familiar materials like
lithium, which the U.S. imports 50 percent of its supply from abroad.
But other materials on the list are less familiar: Tin, which we import
75 percent of, is used for electronic soldering. Cobalt, 76 percent of
which the U.S. must import, is used in rechargeable batteries. Gallium
and manganese, which both have 100 percent reliance on imports, are used
in electronic circuits and batteries, respectively. In fact, the U.S. is
a net exporter of only one of these minerals: hafnium, which is used in
nuclear control rods and alloying of metals. [We don't have to look far
to see the impacts on Indigenous communities: uranium mining on the
Navajo Nation in the name of national security during the Cold War,
proposed copper mines within Oak Flat and Boundary Waters, lithium
mining in Bolivia and northern Chile, gold and silver mining impacting
indigenous communities in northern Mexico, and the current cobalt mining
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.]{.underline}

Stumbles and Evolutions

[But it hasn't been all smooth sailing: there have been plenty of bumps
in the road over the last fifty years. Some village ANCs didn't make it,
a 13th regional corporation was created and subsequently failed, and
ANCSA has been updated multiple times.]{.underline}

"Hindsight is always 20/20. There have been a number of amendments to
ANCSA over the past fifty years that have improved the Act," Murkowski
says.

She also points out that there are many more amendments that still need
to be made.

"As we approach the fifty-year anniversary of the Act, this is a
discussion I would like to help facilitate with leaders and stakeholders
in Alaska to help improve the Act for the next fifty years," Murkowski
says.

Rock explains that the "beauty of ANCSA" is that it continues to evolve.

["Initially, ANCSA **failed to adequately address the relationships
amongst and between ANCs and Tribes regarding the US Federal
Government**. The **separation of economic accountability and land title
from inherently governmental functions and sovereignty** **caused a
rift** between Alaska Native corporations and Alaska Native Tribes for
decades. Only now are we seeing an effort to minimize discord and focus
on a more united Alaska Native community]{.underline}," Rock says.

Some of the most significant amendments to ANCSA came in 1988, though
they didn't take effect until 1991, leading to them commonly being
called the 1991 Amendments. These changes, among other things, afforded
ANCs the ability to expand shareholder eligibility through a process
known as open enrollment.

The amendment was necessary for the "preservation and perpetuation of
birth-right assets, cultural identity, and the sheer opportunity to
survive as Alaska Native peoples," Rock says.

"Consistent with our Iñupiaq values, ASRC was the first corporation to
exercise its option to enroll those born after December 18, 1971 and
provide those enrollees with the same rights and benefits as the
original enrollees," Rock says.

"Without these amendments, there would be generations of Alaska Natives
disenfranchised from their region, assets, and the contemporary bond
shareholder status provides Alaska Natives. Although not all the regions
have exercised this option, that is one more upside to ANCSA's
potential: self-determination."

The 1991 amendments also prevented the sale of ANC shares. When ANCSA
passed, it stipulated that shares can only be passed on to certain
relatives as gifts or through wills, and this remains true today.
However, it was originally intended that, starting in 1991, shareholders
would be able to sell their shares. But the overall profitability and
success of the ANCs was not where Congress had anticipated it to be
after two decades, leading to the continued ban on the selling of stocks
and ANC exemptions from some federal securities laws.

While 1991 marked significant amendments taking effect, smaller changes
to the legislation have happened somewhat regularly.

"It was a negotiation made between Alaska Native leaders and the federal
government fifty years ago," Metrokin says. "There's potential that
future amendments can be made."

One issue that Ahtna's Johns is fighting to address is that Alaska
Natives don't have sovereignty over their subsistence lifestyle on their
lands.

["We weren't given the authority to manage our own lands in regard to
hunting and fishing," John says, noting that the original Ahtna board
had selected lands based on their people's subsistence
needs.]{.underline} "That's one of the high priorities for Ahtna."

["This was a contentious issue at the time that could not be adequately
resolved prior to passage. It was meant to be resolved after passage,
but fifty years later Alaska Native people are still fighting for the
right to practice their traditional subsistence ways of
life,"]{.underline} Murkowski says.

[nullify]{.mark}ing Alaska [Native **land claims**]{.mark},
[especially]{.mark} those [claims that stood in the way of oil]{.mark}
and pipeline [development]{.mark}.]{.underline}

After being declared a state in 1958, Alaska selected for oil
development tracts of land on the North Slope, in an area called Prudhoe
Bay.1 Without consultation and consent of the local Inupiat village, but
with approval of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, these lands were
transferred to the state.2

[In 1964, the state leased some of these tracts to oil companies and in
1968, oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay.3 The [oil boom]{.mark} forever
[altered]{.mark} the [ecosystem and]{.mark} the [life of the Inupiat
people]{.mark}, including by **[contributing to climate change

building of the 800-mile [Trans-Alaska pipeline]{.mark} across the state
[that]{.mark} further **[trampled]{.mark} over the rights** of Inupiat
peoples and [Alaska Native land rights]{.mark} at large.4]{.underline}

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was passed in 1971, over
opposition from the Inupiat.5 ANCSA took land from jurisdictional
control of Alaska Natives, allowing the petroleum industry and State of
Alaska to gain access to oil reserves.6

[[Native Alaskans are once again confronted with **oil** and gas
**expansion**]{.mark} under the Trump administration]{.underline}, with
potential oil drilling in the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and
opening of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas
development.7

In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order lifting a ban on oil
exploration in the coastal seas of Alaska. The U.S. government is now
proposing 19 offshore lease sales in the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea,
Cook Inlet, and other areas.8 [Any [oil spills]{.mark} in these Arctic
waters **[would be catastrophic]{.mark}** for bowhead whales, seals,
polar bears and other marine mammals, [and would]{.mark} directly
[affect]{.mark} the Alaska [Natives']{.mark} subsistence
[culture]{.mark} and way of life.]{.underline}9 Spills or drilling
disasters would mean high-risk cleanup challenged by ice cover, subzero
temperatures, and harsh weather conditions. There is no proven way to
clean sea ice of oil from potential spills.10

The U.S. Republican tax overhaul law passed in December 2017 included a
provision requiring two oil and gas lease sales in the coastal plains
area of the ANWR over the next 10 years.11

ANWR is one of the world's most pristine and beautiful ecosystems, with
landscapes and wildlife that demand the strongest protection. The Refuge
is home to porcupine caribou, muskoxen, moose, Arctic fox, lynx, wolves,
and polar bears, brown bears and black bears, and is a stopping point
for nearly 200 species of migratory birds.12

For Alaska Natives, such as the Gwich'in Athabascan peoples, protecting
the Refuge and the caribou they depend on is a matter of human rights
and the collective right of Indigenous peoples -- as well as a critical
matter of survival.13 [[In opposing Arctic]{.mark} oil
[drilling]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} are **[fight]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark}

calving grounds are within the coastal plain of the Refuge. The Gwich'in
call these caribou calving grounds Iizhik Gwats'an Gwnadaii Goodlit:
"the sacred place where life begins." The Gwich'in have followed the

Alaska Native Peoples and the fragile Arctic ecosystem have yet to fully
recover from the disastrous 1989 Exxon Valdez terminal oil spill. It
killed thousands of animals, severely affecting the local food chain, as

#### Extractive projects cause irreversible harm to Indigenous communities.

**United Nations**, 4/28/**2022**, \"Extractive projects cause
irreparable harm to Indigenous Cultures, languages, lives,\" No
Publication,

accessed 7-24-2025

**[The explosive growth of extractive operations]{.underline}** around
the world often plays out on Indigenous Peoples\' lands without their
consent, **[causing irreparable harm to their livelihoods, cultures,
languages and lives,]{.underline}** speakers told the Permanent Forum on
Indigenous Issues on Monday, as it opened its 2022 session amid calls to
respect their free, prior and informed consent on the existential
decisions uprooting their communities.

Gathered in the UN General Assembly Hall for the first time in three
years, **[Indigenous representatives were welcomed in a traditional
ceremony led by Katsenhaienton Lazare of the Bear Clan, Mohawk of the
Haudenosaunee,]{.underline}** who acknowledged nature in its great
diversity -- the winds, thunders, lightening, sun and other life forces
-- which give purpose and protection to humankind, and summoned
generations of traditional ancestors who still have much to offer
today's societies.

The invocation dovetailed with the theme of the Forum's twenty-first
session -- 'Indigenous peoples, business, autonomy and the human rights
principles of due diligence including free, prior and informed consent'
-- and start of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages,
2022-2032.

An infinity of sacred histories

In opening remarks, Chair Darío José Mejía Montalvo of Colombia said the
2022 theme touches upon the cosmos visions through which Indigenous
Peoples have developed their systems for food, culture and coexistence
with nature on their territories.

"We share a holistic relationship with nature, where rights are not
anthropocentric," he explained.  "An infinity of sacred histories and
stories underpin our visions of the world."

**[Ancestors too have rights -- including to exist -- because their task
is enduring in the preservation of life.  These ancestral practices
maintain life in all its forms, with dignity.]{.underline}**

Therefore, he said the question of whether Indigenous knowledge is
scientific is "meaningless":  concepts of life, energy and spirituality
are synonymous.  Separating them from an economic, religious or other
point of view leads to confusion, disputes and unnecessary clashes.

Trampling over informed consent

He said that while Indigenous Peoples' rights to self-determination,
land, resources and -- importantly -- free, prior and informed consent
are guaranteed under international norms, these rights are often not
applied, even in countries where they are legally recognized.  They are
instead violated routinely in the granting of lumber, timber, mining and
mega-dam contracts.

The pillaging of their resources, loss of their ways of life, cultures
and languages, and the disappearing and killing of their leaders are the
results of harmful business activities.

A binding treaty for business

Mr. Mejía Montalvo said that without a change to the current energy
matrix, **[the extermination of Indigenous Peoples will continue, along
with expropriation of their lands and the sweeping aside of their
rights.]{.underline}**

He pressed States to help devise a legally binding instrument to
regulate transnational business activities -- one that adheres to
international human rights and includes explicit provisions for
Indigenous Peoples' rights to their lands, territory and resources, and
for their free, prior and informed consent on decisions affecting them.

He described the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples and International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No.
169 as "fundamental loadstars" in this regard, and warned that
industries from fashion and media to textiles, food and pharmaceutical
production, are perpetuating "enclave economy models" that expropriate
knowledge and practices from Indigenous Peoples.  "All of these efforts
must be interlinked and stepped up," he said.

WFP Bolivia/Ananí Chavez

Traditional models lead the way

UN General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid said that for
generations, Indigenous communities have prioritized a relationship with
nature -- grounded in kinship, centered around reciprocity and infused
with reverence.  "By emulating their example on a broader scale, we can
preserve the Earth's rich biodiversity and diverse landscapes."  

**[He pointed out that Indigenous Peoples comprise less than five per
cent of the global population yet protect 80 per cent of global
biodiversity]{.underline}**, stressing that high linguistic diversity
occurs where conditions for biological diversity thrive.  "It's the
richness of one that sustains the other," he explained.

Mr. Shahid said there is growing scientific evidence that Indigenous
languages that are rich in oral traditions offer evidence for events
that happened thousands of years ago.

"By preserving and promoting these languages, we preserve and promote an
important part of our human heritage, identity and belonging," he said.
 "We have an obligation to ensure that they can participate in and
benefit from the work of the United Nations." 

Also addressing participants, UN Economic and Social Council President
Collen Vixen Kelapile said the Forum's expert advice -- as an advisory
body to the Council -- is crucial to highlighting the key issues
affecting Indigenous Peoples.

He said the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development-- to
be held in July and feature the national reviews of 45 Member States --
will offer a significant opportunity for Indigenous Peoples to showcase
their traditional knowledge on biodiversity, climate change and
environmental stewardship.

Mr. Kelapile urged Member States to seek their participation, adding: "I
look forward to your recommendations which should be built into the
Council's different platforms".

Manage the most, own the least

UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Liu Zhenmin
-- in a message delivered by Assistant Secretary-General for Policy
Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs Maria-Francesca Spatolisano --
stressed that Indigenous Peoples customarily claim and manage more than
50 per cent of the world's land, yet only legally own 10 per cent of it.

As a result, 40 per cent of the land surface -- five billion hectares --
remain vulnerable to land grabbing and environmental destruction.  When
Indigenous communities resist these actions, they often face extreme
reprisals.

A pledge to do better

**[He cited a 2020 analysis revealing that 331 human rights defenders
were killed -- 26 per cent of them while defending Indigenous Peoples\'
rights --]{.underline}** describing these figures as "startling". UN
entities are working together to improve their response, he said,
strengthening their engagement with country teams and seeking ways to
enhance Indigenous Peoples\' participation in the Organization's
processes.

### AT: Erasure

#### Thinking through apocalypse does not [erase]{.underline} slow violence, it enables us to [challenge it]{.underline}.

[To think through]{.underline} '[our]{.underline}' [present
condition]{.underline} with Anders, [we must widen the scene of
catastrophic threats from]{.underline} the event of [the nuclear strike
to]{.underline} the "slowly unfolding environmental catastrophes" of
[ecological devastation]{.underline}.47 Here we are especially
interested in the apocalyptic passions and stretching exercises that
Anders wanted to convince his contemporaries of, in the awareness of a
humanity at the abyss. [Apocalyptic passions]{.underline}, Anders
teaches us, [are]{.underline} not only **[obsessions with the
end]{.underline}**, but exercises in awareness, [calls to embrace last
chances, and a]{.underline} general scene of a [nervous attempt to
figure things out]{.underline}.

Some of this "[apocalyptic mindfulness]{.underline}"48 [is deeply
engrained in **present-day activism** in the face of an ecological
emergency]{.underline} in the Anthropocene; [in]{.underline} the many
[public acts of grieving, accusing, or warning]{.underline}, e. g.
through die-ins, street blockades, or acts of sabotage (from pipe-lines
to oil paintings). These "[affective workouts]{.underline}"49 in the
face of climate apocalypse [do not only emanate from places most hit by
the climate crises]{.underline}; they do not solely happen in the
islands that are drowning, the sacred territories through which
pipelines are built, the cities with the worst air quality or the
communities suffering health risks because of toxic products in their
waters. [Countless others in Europe, North America and Australia
have]{.underline} "**[woken up]{.underline}**" [to the broken promise of
their]{.underline} '[good life]{.underline}' [and]{.underline} they [are
trying to relate their **dire outlooks** to the ubiquity of **slow
violence** and]{.underline} to [the **ordinariness of catastrophe** in
places long brutalized through slavery, colonialization, and ongoing
exploitation]{.underline}. This [awakening is not necessarily the result
of witnessing and experiencing]{.underline} the [consequences themselves
but of **imagining how bad things might become**]{.underline}, also,
[but **not only, for them**]{.underline}. Often [it is in this intense
work with and via the end]{.underline} vis-à-vis ecological ruination
[that the idea of humans without world is connected to that of world
without humans when activists do such work]{.underline}, which we, with
Anders, describe as "stretching exercises."

### AT: Extinction Happened

#### Asserting that apocalypse is already here [normalizes]{.underline} black and indigenous suffering. 

Delf **Rothe 20**, Senior Researcher in the Institute for Peace Research
and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg, Ph.D. from the
University of Hamburg, "Governing the End Times? Planet Politics and the
Secular Eschatology of the Anthropocene," Millennium: Journal of
International Studies, Vol. 48, No. 2, 2020,
https://doi.org/10.1177/0305829819889138, DG

[Planetary realism, with its acknowledgment that the final time of the
Earth has]{.underline} in fact [already begun, puts an end to
**any**]{.underline} form of messianic or apocalyptic
**[speculation]{.underline}** about the future. The recourse to
Augustine of Hippo, one of the crucial Christian eschatological
thinkers, helps further unpack the political project of planetary
realism, and in particular its [ambivalence between letting
go]{.underline} ([embracing uncertainty]{.underline} and adapting to the
new reality of the Anthropocene) [and the will to control
time]{.underline} ([by turning resilience into a policy
model]{.underline} of polycentric governance and self-management).106

St Augustine developed his eschatological thinking in the 4th century AD
107 -- at a time when Christians were experiencing increased violence
and bodily suffering. 108 Against the backdrop of the resulting
spiritual turbulences, St Augustine opposed '\[t\]he twin "Gnostic"
temptations of either purist retreat from a denigrated world or an
eschatological outbreak of political messianism'. 109 For him, the
incarnation of Jesus Christ marked the crucial eschatological moment and
the advent of the senectus mundi -- the last period of history.110 Yet,
contrary to millennialists, who held that the period of the end times
would last a thousand years, he understood the senectus mundi as a
period of indefinite length.111 St Augustine challenged the assumption
that the end times could be calculated, anticipated or deduced from
earthly signs (such as natural disasters).112 This interpretation of the
end times as a radically open and uncertain period deprived Christian
eschatology of its utopian potential, as '\[s\]uch a view frees from any
speculation regarding the end of the world'. 113

St Augustine is often described as the first political realist, who
inspired many later ones such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Hans Morgenthau or
Reinhold Niebuhr. 114 According to this reading, [the common
denominator]{.underline} of these thinkers [is]{.underline} their
**[anti-utopianism]{.underline}**. We also find this anti-utopianism
[in]{.underline} the [planetary realist discourse]{.underline} of the
Anthropocene. In this discourse [the Anthropocene]{.underline} '[is not
something than can be repaired or transformed, **only
endured**]{.underline}'.115 Furthermore, just like St Augustine rejected
any human speculation about the duration or unfolding of the senectus
mundi, planetary realism rejects any belief in the final revelation of
Gaia's secrets to humans. 116

[Resilience]{.underline} then [turns]{.underline} this [fundamental
uncertainty and insecurity into a resource for]{.underline} a policy
model of [**self-management** and **adaptation**]{.underline}. To
understand how this translation works, we need to come back for a moment
to St Augustine and his writing on human sin and salvation. Here, St
Augustine addressed the fundamental question of why devout Christians
who had not personally committed any wrongdoings had to experience
increased suffering.117 St Augustine's answer was that [meaningless
suffering was]{.underline} in fact [proof of]{.underline} the [original
sin]{.underline} of men, which in his reading was not based on the
individual deeds of Christian subjects but instead the literal
inheritance of humans as the children of Adam.118 As Vassilios Paipais
notes: 'In its Augustinian formulation, original sin was linked to a
soteriological perspective; that is, a defence of its status as a
corollary of the doctrine that all human beings are equally in need of
salvation in Christ'.119 However, with original sin as the literal
inheritance of all human beings, even faithful members of the Church
could never be certain about their inclusion in the 'City of God' --
that is, salvation after the return of Christ.120
[Salvation]{.underline}, thus, [was not]{.underline} so much [a promise
of an open future but]{.underline} rather [required a **continuous
process** of self-reflection and inner change]{.underline} -- albeit
[with an **uncertain ending**]{.underline}. This re-articulation allowed
the Church to establish an entire 'economy of salvation',121 based on
the practice of confession, in which the [uncertainty]{.underline} faced
by Christian subjects [was turned into a **governance
model**]{.underline} of pastoral conduct.

[The realpolitik of resilience]{.underline}, then, [updates]{.underline}
the pastoral model of [self-government for the]{.underline} secular era
of the [Anthropocene]{.underline} and replaces the 'soteriological
finitude' of the Christian subject with the 'factical finitude' of all
living beings. 122 Here, [human suffering is neither considered a
necessary evil that has to be endured]{.underline} until the completion
of salvation (as in eco-modernism) [nor a sign that dramatic actions is
needed]{.underline} (as in eco- catastrophism). In planetary realism and
resilience thinking, [suffering]{.underline} is not considered an evil
in the first place. Rather, it [becomes an **essential feature
of**]{.underline} (finite) **[life]{.underline}** in the Anthropocene
[and a driver of learning, adaptation and renewal]{.underline}. Just as
Christian eschatology made the Christian subject accept their original
sin as the basis of a 'political economy of salvation', the secular
eschatology of planetary realism forces homo adaptivus to accept their
vulnerability as the basis of a political economy of resilience, in
which [adaptability becomes the core value]{.underline}. 123 [As
lifeforms at risk from environmental change can neither turn to an
omniscient god nor to modern science]{.underline} in the hope of
salvation, [resilient life becomes itself the key]{.underline}
katechontic power in the struggle with the eschaton. [The everyday lives
of racialised communities and marginalised people]{.underline} in the
Majority World [**become the primary battleground** of this
struggle]{.underline}. In this way, [planetary realism
links]{.underline} the Augustinian interpretation of meaningless
[suffering to the **normalisation of black and indigenous suffering
through discourses and practices of resilience**]{.underline}. 124

#### This logic is essentializing and bad.

Delf **Rothe 20**, Senior Researcher in the Institute for Peace Research
and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg, Ph.D. from the
University of Hamburg, "Governing the End Times? Planet Politics and the
Secular Eschatology of the Anthropocene," Millennium: Journal of

https://doi.org/10.1177/0305829819889138, DG

In this imaginary, [indigenous resilience]{.underline} is [inherently
tied to local, traditional forms of knowledge]{.underline} and the
ability of indigenous people to detect signs of change from their
environment.74 Planetary realism [frames indigenous populations as
**perfectly adapted** to local ecosystems]{.underline} and their various
rhythms, patterns and cycles.75 Given the difficulties of modern
scientific methods to anticipate and predict environmental changes at
the local level, planetary realism discourse turns to indigenous forms
of knowledge and related cosmologies. As indigenous cosmologies are
perceived as being established through interaction with nature's own
rhythms, they are considered more appropriate for local practices of
adaptation.76 [Politics of resilience]{.underline}, thus, [transvalue
indigenous forms of knowledge **only insofar** as they can be
appropriated by white people to **guarantee their own
survival**]{.underline} in the turmoil of the Anthropocene. 77
[Such]{.underline} apparently benevolent [practices and
discourses]{.underline} of the UN and other global governance actors in
fact [**essentialise indigeneity** and **romanticise black suffering as
a resource of survival**]{.underline}.7

[Indigenous and black scholars]{.underline} have thus [**criticised**
planetary realism and its affirmation of indigenous forms of
knowledge]{.underline}. Scholars such Kyle Whyte, Zoe Todd, Heather
Davis, and Axelle Karera have argued that for many indigenous and black
people, the world has in fact already ended.79 However, unlike Morton
and other Western thinkers, they base these arguments on the concrete
historical experience of marginalised people with colonialism and the
violent destruction of their lifeworlds. As Christina Sharpe argues, the
repercussions of chattel slavery and European colonialism are felt until
today and are reinforced through the effects of unfolding climate
change.80 [By claiming that the world]{.underline} (**[in
singular]{.underline}**) [has]{.underline} already [ended, planetary
realists **universalise** the experience of black and indigenous people
and]{.underline} thus **[dramatise]{.underline}** '**[white people
living under the conditions they have forced upon
others]{.underline}**'.81

As illustrated in Figure 3, in loop B---Corporate Procedural
Solution---[the problem symptom is identified and a symptomatic solution
is quickly applied, often with the "easiest, most available, previously
used, \[or\] organizationally accepted... fix" \[23\]. The problem
symptom appears to be resolved in the short term; however, the
symptomatic solution creates a side effect]{.underline} (i.e., tangible
results are prioritized over relationships), as seen in Figure 3[. As a
result, the problem is either worsened or remains the same as it was
before the symptomatic solution was applied. Each time the symptomatic
solution is applied, and the side effect occurs, the resources available
to implement the fundamental solution dwindle, resulting in a positive
or reinforcing feedback loop. Given this positive feedback, eventually
the problem symptom occurs once again, leaving change agents with the
decision to apply a symptomatic solution or address the issue
holistically by confronting the problematic underlying structures of the
system.]{.underline} The fundamental solution, however, depicted as the
"B---Relationship-Based Solution" loop in Figure 3, requires more
resources to implement and often longer timelines than the solutions
offered in the B---Corporate Procedural Solution loop. The fundamental
solution, while perceptibly unattractive due to resource and time
investment, solves not only the problem symptoms but, more importantly,
addresses the root cause of the problem, thereby breaking the feedback
loop altogether \[1\]. This archetype illustrates how addressing the
symptoms rather than the fundamental underlying problems can lead to
reliance on symptomatic solutions and even contribute to the problem
\[1\]. While merely solving the visible symptomatic concerns is an
attractive option[, it fails to address the underlying structures that
cause these visible concerns and will result in the continuation of a
system that lacks resilience and produces problems.]{.underline} Braun
\[20\] highlights that the desirability of this approach is logical, as
the investment of time and resources differs greatly between short-term
(symptomatic) and long-term (fundamental) solutions. However, in failing
to implement long-term fundamental solutions, the system will face
concerns in perpetuity and likely result in a greater investment of time
resources in the long run. As demonstrated in Figure 3, the blue
connections represent the superficial approach, [which begins with
corporations attempting to address the need to develop relationships
with Indigenous communities to manage the regulatory requirements of
their projects. Understandably, this kind of approach results in an
increasing pressure for the relationship to produce "results" while
ensuring low-risk and politically correct outcomes and consequently can
be seen to prioritize results over relationships.This approach to
ensuring that corporations' projects meet regulatory requirements and
are profitable results in increasingly "safe" attempts to work with
Indigenous communities. This, in many ways, as far as the corporation
and government regulatory bodies are concerned, meets the original need
to develop relationships with Indigenous communities the cost of
meaningfully engaging with local Indigenous communities on mine closure
and reclamation is insignificant relative to mine operations and mine
closure expenditures.]{.underline} The actual cost of executing
reclamation is different than including Indigenous Peoples in planning
for reclamation. The average cost to reclaim an oil sands mine ranges
from CAD 10,000 to CAD 320,000 per hectare depending on the materials
being reclaimed (e.g., treated or untreated fine tailings, coarse
tailings, overburden, process water, etc.) and the ecosystem types
(e.g., lake, forest, wetland) \[61,63\]. Experimental wetland
reclamation costs have been cited as high as CAD 926,000 per hectare
\[63\]. In contrast, a multistakeholder group costs less to operate
annually than the cheapest average reclamation cost per hectare (i.e.,
\<CAD 10 k). For example, it cost the CEMA approximately CAD 5 M per
year to operate five working groups with industry, government,
Indigenous community, and NGO representation, which included over one
hundred participants, and to co-create reclamation and other cumulative
effects guidance documents \[64\]. Beyond the cost of engagement, the
inclusion of contributed IK and recommendations into future mine closure
and reclamation plans is unlikely to translate into significantly
increased reclamation operational costs. [Mine waste will still need to
be treated, landforms graded, soils moved and placed, and vegetation,
wildlife habitats, and traditional land uses established as per
provincial regulatory requirements. The inclusion and participation of
Indigenous communities means there will be more local and relevant
information to inform future plan iterations to increase the likelihood
of achieving post-closure traditional land use capability, trust, and
reclamation certification.]{.underline} Discussion points and
recommended changes by Indigenous communities have typically included
the following: holistic or landscape-level perspectives; cultural
reconnection (e.g., community monitoring metrics); different ecosystem
or ecosite and landform configurations (e.g., orientations that support
natural wildlife migrations); different wildlife and revegetation
strategies (e.g., more of different culturally significant species); and
the renewal of special places and features (e.g., traditional trails,
camps, traplines, etc.), which are currently lacking in the oil sands
industry's life of mine closure plans \[50\]. [Thus, the cost of doing
this work in a "good way" with Indigenous communities is unlikely to
significantly increase the average operational cost. The first, and
perhaps most important, practical implication of this work would be to
use the Shifting the Burden Archetype to diagnose, interrupt, and
practice discernment around typical or conventional corporate and
government responses to relations with Indigenous
communities/Nations.]{.underline} Even just by doing this, it may open
new suites of potential approaches to building relationships with
Indigenous communities/Nations. Second, and realistically, based on this
analysis, what can a company do to avoid the pitfalls associated with
this systemic archetype? The authors defer to the work of Machado de
Oliveira and Stein, where Machado de Oliveira quotes Stein's Four Hs of
relationship building---honesty, humility, humour, and hyper-reflexivity
\[74\]. The Four Hs will be necessary in undertaking a kind of corporate
psychotherapy to interrupt behaviour and practice discernment \[74\].
[Once a company acknowledges the implications of the dynamic illustrated
above, the best they can aspire to is to be completely honest about
their position. Mining companies will negotiate impact benefit
agreements with affected Indigenous communities, but these are only
interested in economic negotiations and not necessarily economic and
sustainability benefits.]{.underline} These mines will invest in
consultation and engagement, but will not work through the more
fundamental resolution to apply the gathered IK, perspectives, and other
ways of learning towards reclaiming traditional land use capability,
cultural landscapes, and homelands. [That is, to be honest about the
fact that they are a company, whose sole purpose is to make money for
their shareholders, in a neo-liberal economy where government regulation
is constantly being pulled back in order to let the market make key
decisions, and that as a result, any attempt, however modest, to do
anything that will not contribute to the profitability of the company
will be seen as a detriment to leadership, even if that means that there
is a risk that the cost of inadequately addressing Indigenous, Treaty,
and land use rights in post-closure landscape outcomes may fall to
Canadian taxpayers in the future. Therefore, companies should be humbler
and more honest about what they, as a company can do in terms of
relationship building and making claims to "indigenize", "decolonize",
or contribute to "reconciliation".]{.underline} There is no
reconciliation with the "Wendigo"---so do not claim otherwise. This kind
of honesty, openness, and humility must come with a sense of humour
about the situation, to acknowledge that the situation is, in many ways,
ludicrous. And finally, this requires a level of depth work on behalf of
individuals involved, especially within companies and at the level of
company leadership. This hyper-reflexivity involves an acknowledgement
of assumptions, privilege, biases, archetypes, and as Jung would have
described them, complexes---a form of individual and corporate depth
therapy that may, as of yet, not exist. Kegan and Lahey's work on
"immunity to change" may gesture towards this, as does Machado de
Oliveira's "hospicing modernity" \[62\]. A discussion of these is beyond
the scope of this paper and constitutes a clear avenue for fruitful
future research. This paper has broad implications within corporate and
government Indigenous relations beyond this particular policy context,
as these dynamics can be seen almost anywhere around the world with the
continued use of fossil fuels and mineral and metal extraction for the
energy transition.

#### Benefit sharing breeds uncertainty

**Sustainability Directory, 25** \[Sustainability Directory (No specific
author), 05-17-25, Sustainability Directory, "Equitable Benefit
Sharing,"
https://prism.sustainability-directory.com/term/equitable-benefit-sharing
accessed 7-24 DG\]

Despite the existence of international frameworks, [implementing
Equitable Benefit Sharing in practice faces numerous
challenges.]{.underline} [One significant hurdle is the **lack of
comprehensive and clear national ABS legislation** in many countries.
This can create **legal uncertainty** for both providers and users,
hindering the establishment of ABS agreements.]{.underline} The
complexity of navigating different national legal systems also poses a
challenge for users operating in multiple countries.

[Power **imbalances** between resource providers and users can also
**undermine equitable negotiations.** Indigenous peoples and local
communities may **lack the legal expertise** or resources to effectively
negotiate with large corporations or research institutions. Building the
capacity of these communities to engage in ABS processes is therefore
crucial.]{.underline}

[Another challenge lies in **monitoring** and **enforcing** compliance
with ABS agreements. Tracking the **utilization of genetic** resources
and ensuring that **benefits are shared** throughout the value chain,
**especially in cases of commercialization**, can be difficult. The lack
of effective compliance mechanisms at the international level
exacerbates this challenge.]{.underline}

[Translating the principles of equitable sharing into tangible outcomes
requires **overcoming significant legal**, **capacity**, and
**enforcement hurdles.**]{.underline}

Furthermore, the increasing use of digital sequence information (DSI)
from genetic resources presents new complexities for ABS. Determining
how to apply ABS principles to the utilization of digital data, which

Academic

[Equitable Benefit Sharing]{.underline}, within the academic and expert
discourse, [transcends a mere transactional]{.underline} exchange; it
represents a dynamic and evolving socio-legal construct fundamentally
intertwined with concepts of environmental justice, intellectual
property rights, and the decolonization of knowledge. It operates as a
critical mechanism for operationalizing the third objective of the
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) → the fair and equitable
sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources
→ and extends its purview to associated traditional knowledge. This
intricate concept grapples with inherent power asymmetries between
knowledge holders, often indigenous and local communities in
biodiversity-rich regions, and users, frequently research institutions
and corporations in technologically advanced nations. [The challenge
lies not only in **establishing clear legal pathways** for access and
benefit sharing (ABS) but also in fostering relationships built on
genuine reciprocity, recognition of diverse knowledge systems, and a
commitment to **addressing historical inequities.**]{.underline}

The academic exploration of Equitable Benefit Sharing delves into its
theoretical underpinnings, examining its roots in international
environmental law, human rights law, and property theory. It scrutinizes
the effectiveness of existing legal instruments, such as the Nagoya
Protocol, in achieving their stated objectives, often highlighting the
gap between normative aspirations and practical implementation. A
critical perspective reveals that while the Nagoya Protocol provides a
framework for prior informed consent (PIC) and mutually agreed terms
(MAT), its effectiveness is contingent upon robust national legislation,
effective enforcement mechanisms, and the capacity of provider
communities to engage in complex negotiations. The protocol's reliance
on bilateral agreements, while intended to provide flexibility, can
inadvertently exacerbate power imbalances, leaving communities
vulnerable in the absence of strong legal support and negotiating
expertise.

Theoretical Underpinnings and Legal Complexities

The legal foundation of Equitable Benefit Sharing rests significantly on
the principle of state sovereignty over natural resources, as affirmed
by the CBD. This marked a significant departure from the historical
notion of genetic resources as the common heritage of humankind. The
shift empowered states to regulate access to their genetic resources and
negotiate terms for benefit sharing.

However, the implementation of this sovereign right is complicated by
the transboundary nature of genetic resources and the globalized nature
of research and development. The utilization of digital sequence
information (DSI), for instance, poses a profound challenge to the
territorial basis of traditional ABS frameworks, as genetic information
can be readily accessed and utilized anywhere in the world without
physical access to the biological resource itself.

The interplay between ABS and intellectual property rights (IPR)
constitutes a particularly complex and often contentious area of
academic inquiry. IPR systems, primarily designed to protect individual
or corporate innovations, can sometimes conflict with the collective and
intergenerational nature of traditional knowledge.

Disclosure of Origin → One proposed mechanism to link IPR with ABS is
requiring the disclosure of the source of genetic resources and
associated traditional knowledge in patent applications. This aims to
enhance transparency and facilitate the tracing of benefits back to the
providers.

Sui Generis Systems → The development of

sui generis legal systems, tailored specifically to the characteristics
of traditional knowledge, is another avenue explored to provide
effective protection and facilitate benefit sharing. India's Biological
Diversity Act, for example, is considered a sui generis law that
includes provisions for consulting local communities and ensuring
equitable benefit sharing for the use of traditional knowledge.

Joint Ownership → Negotiating joint ownership of intellectual property
rights arising from the utilization of genetic resources and traditional
knowledge is a way to ensure that providers have a direct stake in the
outcomes.

The ethical dimensions of Equitable Benefit Sharing are also a
significant focus of academic discussion. This includes exploring
concepts of distributive justice, fairness, and reciprocity in the
context of resource utilization and knowledge sharing. The historical
context of colonialism and the exploitation of resources and knowledge
from developing countries informs much of this ethical analysis,
highlighting the need for remedial justice in contemporary ABS
frameworks.

The academic lens reveals Equitable Benefit Sharing as a complex
interplay of legal frameworks, power dynamics, and ethical
considerations, striving for justice in the utilization of biological
resources and traditional knowledge.

formations that suggest a link between future AI and nature. The glass

Analytical Frameworks and Methodologies

Academics employ a range of analytical frameworks and methodologies to
assess the effectiveness and equity of benefit-sharing arrangements.
These often draw from disciplines such as law, economics, anthropology,
sociology, and environmental studies.

Legal Analysis → This involves examining the provisions of international
and national ABS laws and regulations, analyzing their coherence,
effectiveness, and alignment with the principles of fairness and equity.
It also includes case law analysis to understand how ABS principles are
being interpreted and applied in practice.

Economic Modeling → Economists develop models to assess the potential
monetary benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and
to explore different mechanisms for their distribution. This can involve
valuing biodiversity and traditional knowledge, although this remains a
challenging task.

Socio-cultural Analysis → Anthropologists and sociologists study the
social and cultural contexts of resource provider communities, examining
their customary laws, governance structures, and perceptions of fairness
and value. This helps to ensure that benefit-sharing arrangements are
culturally appropriate and responsive to the needs and priorities of the
communities.

Stakeholder Analysis → This involves identifying and analyzing the
interests, power dynamics, and relationships among various stakeholders
involved in ABS processes, including governments, corporations, research
institutions, indigenous peoples, and local communities. Understanding
these dynamics is crucial for designing effective and equitable
benefit-sharing mechanisms.

Case Studies → In-depth case studies of specific ABS agreements or
initiatives provide valuable empirical data on the challenges and
successes of implementing Equitable Benefit Sharing in different
contexts. These studies can highlight best practices and lessons
learned.

Applying these analytical approaches reveals that the success of
Equitable Benefit Sharing is not solely dependent on the existence of
legal frameworks but also on the capacity of institutions, the level of
awareness and participation of stakeholders, and the political will to
address power imbalances and prioritize equity.

of AI artificial intelligence. Glossy and matte elements suggest
material considerations for design promoting sustainability, with
technology. A spherical accent piece, an elegant oval vase, and a
textured dark gray egg highlight sustainable resources and waste
reduction.

The Power Dynamic Angle → A Critical Insight

A particularly potent, albeit sometimes controversial, angle in the
academic analysis of Equitable Benefit Sharing centers on the inherent
power dynamics that shape interactions between resource providers and
users. This perspective argues that despite the legal frameworks
established by the CBD and the Nagoya Protocol, the playing field
remains significantly uneven. Multinational corporations and well-funded
research institutions often possess superior legal expertise, financial
resources, and access to information compared to many indigenous and
local communities. This disparity can influence the negotiation process,
potentially leading to agreements that, while legally compliant, may not
be truly equitable.

[This critical view suggests that the current ABS framework, heavily
reliant on bilateral negotiations and contractual agreements, may
inadvertently perpetuate existing power imbalances. Communities,
particularly those with limited access to legal counsel or experience in
international negotiations, may feel pressured to accept terms that do
not fully reflect the value of their resources or knowledge, or that do
not adequately address their long-term development needs. The focus on
monetary benefits, while important, can sometimes overshadow the need
for non-monetary benefits that may be more impactful for community
well-being and cultural preservation, such as capacity building,
technology transfer, or the recognition of traditional resource
management practices.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the increasing privatization of biodiversity research and
the commodification of genetic resources can intensify these power
imbalances. As genetic resources and associated knowledge become
valuable assets in the global bio-economy, the economic incentives for
rapid access and utilization can sometimes override the principles of
equity and respect for traditional custodians. This critical perspective
calls for a more fundamental rethinking of the power dynamics within the
ABS system, advocating for mechanisms that strengthen the bargaining
position of provider communities, ensure greater transparency in
negotiations, and establish independent oversight mechanisms to review
and potentially challenge agreements that are deemed inequitable. [It
suggests that achieving true equitable benefit sharing requires not just
legal frameworks, but also a conscious effort to dismantle systemic
power imbalances and foster genuine partnerships based on mutual respect
and shared decision-making.]{.underline}

#### Companies don't want to drill in an uncertain environment

**Hite '25** Ryan Hite, 4-18-2025, Ryan Hite is an American author,

Crisis: From Black Gold to Economic Uncertainty,\" Ryan J. Hite,
https://www.ryanjhite.com/2025/04/18/alaskas-oil-crisis-the-resource-that-built-a-state-and-what-happens-after-it-ends/

Driving through Alaska feels like traveling back in time. Miles of
untouched wilderness, snow-draped peaks, and skies so vast they make you
feel small. It's raw, beautiful, and untamed. But don't let the
stillness fool you---beneath this remote exterior lies a state built on
energy, and now caught in the middle of a looming economic crisis. Oil
made Alaska what it is today. It paid for its schools, hospitals, roads,
and even puts cash into the hands of every Alaskan annually through the
state's Permanent Fund dividend. But today, [Alaska's oil industry is in
decline.]{.underline} Not because reserves are running out---but because
[extracting and transporting this oil is no longer as attractive as it
once was]{.underline}. This is the real story of Alaska's rise through
resource extraction---and the uncertainty ahead. How Resources Made
Alaska Matter Alaska was first inhabited over 15,000 years ago, when
hunter-gatherers crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia. In modern
history, Alaska's growth has always been tied to natural
resources---first gold, then oil. The Gold That Started It All In the
1880s, gold prospectors traveled north from the American West, drawn by
rumors of wealth in the icy wilds. A major discovery near what is now
Juneau sparked the Alaska Gold Rush. Towns like Nome and Fairbanks
quickly sprang to life. By the early 20th century, Alaska was generating
millions in gold revenue each year. This wealth fueled the push for
infrastructure, including the construction of a major railway from
Fairbanks to Seward---a crucial project that led to the founding of
Anchorage. The Oil That Secured Statehood The biggest transformation
came with oil. In 1957, a significant oil discovery on the Kenai
Peninsula gave Alaska the economic credentials it needed to argue for
statehood. Two years later, Alaska became the 49th U.S. state. But the
discovery that truly changed everything came a decade later: Prudhoe
Bay. Prudhoe Bay: America's Oil Jackpot Prudhoe Bay was a gamble.
Remote, frozen, and logistically nightmarish, the region was initially
dismissed. [But when geologists drilled deeper, they struck a field
containing 25 billion barrels of oil---the largest oil discovery in
North American history. Suddenly, Alaska went from fringe territory to
vital energy hub.]{.underline} The Trans-Alaska Pipeline To move this
oil, the state built a pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez on the Gulf
of Alaska. Completed in 1977, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline spanned over 800
miles and became one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in
American history. With oil flowing, Alaska's economy exploded. By 1988,
the state was the top oil producer in the U.S. Oil revenues made up 90%
of Alaska's general fund, funding nearly all public services. The
Decline: Why Alaska's Oil Industry Is Fading Despite still holding tens
of billions of barrels in reserves, production has steadily declined
since the late 1980s. 1[. Complex **Regulatory Hurdles** Extracting oil
in Alaska means dealing with 11 federal and state agencies to get over
60 permits---a process that can take years. For private companies, this
makes Alaska less attractive compared to streamlined projects in places
like Texas or North Dakota. 2. **High Costs and Harsh Conditions** It
costs twice the national average to extract oil in Alaska. Permafrost
melting during warmer summers damages infrastructure. Much of the
easy-to-reach oil is already gone. What's left is harder and more
expensive to extract. 3. **Political Uncertainty** Much of Alaska's
remaining reserves lie on federally managed land. That means any project
is vulnerable to changing administrations. A project greenlit by one
president can be halted by the next. This instability keeps investors
wary.]{.underline} 4. Shifting Priorities in the U.S. Energy Landscape
With the rise of shale oil and the renewable energy transition, Alaska's
remote oil fields no longer carry the strategic weight they once did.
Economic Fallout: The Cost of Dependency Alaska's economy is still
deeply tied to oil: Half of all jobs in Alaska are directly or
indirectly tied to petroleum. The Permanent Fund---a sovereign wealth
fund now worth over \$80 billion---relies on oil revenue to pay yearly
dividends to every resident. As production falls, budgets tighten.
Roads, schools, and services suffer. Alternate industries like seafood,
timber, and tourism can't close the gap. The Environmental Paradox
Alaska faces a difficult balance: it wants to protect its natural beauty
while maintaining economic independence. Two case studies highlight this
tension: The Pebble Mine One of the largest untapped gold deposits in
the world. Project was blocked due to concerns over polluting Bristol
Bay, one of Earth's richest salmon habitats. The Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) Home to vital caribou calving grounds and
Indigenous communities. Opened for drilling under Trump---but most oil
companies declined to participate. Constant political back-and-forth
prevents long-term planning. What the Future Holds for Alaska [Alaska
isn't out of oil---it's out of time. Unless investment processes are
streamlined and new value-added industries are developed, the state's
economic model may collapse under its own weight]{.underline}. But the
state also has unique strengths: Massive remaining oil and mineral
reserves A strategic location in both the Arctic and Pacific A history
of resilience and resourcefulness Alaskans have always walked a
tightrope between progress and preservation. Whether the future holds
economic reinvention or prolonged decline depends on the decisions made
in the next few years.

**Martinson '15** Erica Martinson, 9-28-2015, Erica Martinson is a

\"Shell calls off its multibillion-dollar mission in Alaska\'s Arctic,\"
Anchorage Daily News,
https://www.adn.com/energy/article/shell-drops-arctic-drilling-plans/2015/09/28/

[Royal Dutch Shell is walking away from dreams of offshore oil in
Alaska\'s Arctic after coming up dry on its \$7 billion test well in the
Chukchi Sea. Citing high costs, disappointing results and an
**\"unpredictable\" regulatory environment,**]{.underline} Shell
announced Monday that it\'s giving up and leaving Alaska for the
\"foreseeable future.\" Politicians quickly cast blame on the federal
government and the Obama administration for sandbagging the regulatory
process, slowing progress until it was no longer worth the trouble for
Shell. The company\'s ambitious plans for Alaska may not be completely
dead, but [it\'s unlikely that any Shell drilling will happen in the
state\'s Arctic waters anytime soon]{.underline}. \"Shell continues to
see important exploration potential in the basin, and the area is likely
to ultimately be of strategic importance to Alaska and the U.S.,\" said
Marvin Odum, director of Shell Upstream Americas, while acknowledging a
\"clearly disappointing\" outcome to exploration. The global outlook for
oil exploration has changed dramatically in the years since Shell
launched its plan to drill in the Chukchi \-- the price of a barrel of
oil has fallen from more than \$90 to less than \$50. But Shell
spokesman Curtis Smith said Monday that current oil prices were not a
significant driver in the decision. \"At any given time we have a suite
of investment options in our portfolio and not all of them can be
funded,\" he said. [The company based the long-term feasibility of the
project on expectations of prices 10 to 15 years from now, \"not the
price environment we are experiencing today,\" Smith said.]{.underline}
The company will seal its Burger J well, west of Barrow, and has no
plans to drill at its Burger V well, Smith said. The company\'s two rigs
\-- the Polar Pioneer and the Noble Discoverer \-- will head south,
along with dozens of support vessels. \"I\'m not surprised,\" Cindy
Giglio, a senior analyst with IHS Energy, said of the announcement,
citing low commodity prices and Shell\'s ongoing merger with U.K. energy
company BG. Prices have dropped \"\$75 or so since they committed\" to
the project, Giglio said. And given Alaska\'s financial troubles[, the
environment may not be as friendly as Shell would like]{.underline},
particularly with the merger taking up much of the company\'s focus,
Giglio said. Alaska also can\'t offer much in terms of a financial break
as an incentive for further exploration \-- the state has no authority
to tax offshore oil in federal waters, and no rights to royalties from
the drilling there. Exploration over \'for the foreseeable future\'
Alaska Gov. Bill Walker said Monday he contacted the White House to set
up meetings to discuss the impact of Shell\'s decision and to renew his
push for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \"While the
company\'s recent announcement is disappointing, it is a reminder that
underscores the need for Alaska to drive its own destiny through
development of known gas resources, as well as rich oil reserves in a
small area of ANWR,\" Walker said. But [for Shell, further exploration
is over \"for the foreseeable future,]{.underline}\" the company said,
noting an \"unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore
Alaska.\" The chances for success weren\'t great from the start, Giglio
said. \"To drill one well and expect one well to be fantastic,\" the
odds aren\'t good. \"That\'s not how exploration works,\" she said.
[Alaska is already an expensive place to drill, and \"the Arctic\'s a
lot harder to justify, financially,\" Giglio said.]{.underline} Shell\'s
most recent annual capital expenditure budget, revised for the second
quarter, is \$30 billion, down 10 to 15 percent from recent years, when
the budget hovered around \$37 billion. So spending billions on one test
well takes up a large portion of that budget, Giglio said. The drilling
efforts offered some much-needed hope for filling the quarter-full
trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Recent resource evaluations by the federal
government estimated total recoverable oil in the Chukchi to be 15.38
billion barrels and total recoverable oil in the Beaufort to be 8.22
billion barrels. Shell, in its approved exploration plan, had proposed
to continue Chukchi exploration for at least another year. If
exploration proved successful, development to bring the prospect into
production would be sanctioned no earlier than 2020, the company\'s
chief executive said earlier this month. After years of halting efforts,
this summer Shell drilled 6,800 feet into the basin, located in about
150 feet of water 80 miles off Alaska\'s northwest coast, with great
expectations for discovering massive, untapped oil reserves. The company
noted that the basin, which is about half the size of the Gulf of
Mexico, \"remains substantially under-explored.\"

#### Corporate withdrawal in the Arctic leads to an overreliance on underdeveloped federal resources 

**Conley and Melino '19** Heather A. Conley and Matthew Melino,

Arctic Region,\" CSIS,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/implications-us-policy-stagnation-toward-arctic-region

U.S. policy toward the Arctic is driven by these factors as well as
Alaska's important domestic economic role providing vital energy,
mineral, and fishery resources[. The Alaskan North Slope contains some
of the country's largest oils fields and natural gas fields; the 2016
value of its mineral industry was \$2.83 billion3; and fisherman landed
\$5.4 billion of fish and shellfish in 2017.4 Alaska's economic activity
has been subdued for the past several years due to lower global energy
prices.]{.underline} The state must respond to increased coastal erosion
necessitating village relocation, permafrost thaw, and fresh water
scarcity which is dramatically altering traditional livelihoods.

Despite the relentless pace of the three major drivers, U.S. policy
toward the Arctic has remained largely stagnant over the past decade
with a continued emphasis on science and international collaboration. In
other words, the United States "makes do" by "making it work." This has
been particularly true for the U.S. Coast Guard, the lead U.S. agency
with responsibilities for protecting the American Arctic and securing
maritime waterways. Despite over a decade of studies and assessments,
the U.S. Coast Guard continues to rely on outdated capabilities and
thinly resourced budgets, which equates to a seasonal U.S. Coast Guard
presence (July-October) in the American Arctic. Should an incident occur
in the American Arctic, it is hoped that it happens during this season
and preferably near a pre-positioned U.S. maritime asset. Years of
underinvestment now leaves the United States ill-prepared as other
nations prioritize the region as one of future geostrategic value.

The Trump administration concluded the U.S. Arctic Council chairmanship
without significant change, but [the administration began to disassemble
the Obama administration's Arctic-specific administrative structures,
emphasized economic development, and dismissed climate impacts in the
region.]{.underline} The U.S. budget dedicated to Arctic science and
research has remained largely intact due to bipartisan congressional
support, and U.S. secretaries of state continue to attend Arctic Council
ministerial meetings. The Trump administration has re-opened onshore and
offshore areas in the American Arctic for development such as the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas drilling with expedited
environmental review although judicial review has slowed this process.
New offshore leases in the Chukchi Sea have been made available, and the
administration is working to promote oil exploration beneath ANWR's
coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea in what is thought to be the
largest untapped onshore oil deposit in North America. In 2017, the
governor of Alaska signed a Joint Development Agreement with China worth
an estimated \$43 billion to develop Alaskan liquified natural gas (LNG)
for export to China.

[Despite this greater desire for and receptivity to Arctic economic
development, U.S. Arctic infrastructure remains very limited and will
inhibit economic development.]{.underline} The closest U.S. deep-water
port is Dutch Harbor in the southern Bering Sea, which is over 800 miles
from the Bering Strait. The lack of icebreaking capabilities is one of
the most glaring of U.S. capability gaps, but the U.S. Coast Guard
recently selected a firm to construct a polar security cutter which
should be in service by 2024.7 As transits through the Bering Strait
have more than doubled over the past decade,8 there is also an urgent
need for greater communications assets and maritime domain awareness
capabilities, particularly through the narrow Bering Strait.

### I/L -- General Uncertainty\-\--2NC

#### Corporations hate uncertainty

**Mauldin '25** John Mauldin, 4-18-2025, \"The Uncertainty World,\"
https://www.mauldineconomics.com/frontlinethoughts/the-uncertainty-world

Markets don't like uncertainty. It is a cliché, but for a very good
reason. It is more than a truism. In fact, [businesses don't like
uncertainty]{.underline}. You and I don't like uncertainty in our
personal lives. When we go to the store, we want to be certain that what
we are looking for is there, and at a reasonable price. We want our food
orders to be certain. We want our relationships to be certain. In fact,
the relationships we value most are the ones in which we feel certain
whether it's personal, business, or investing.

Today we are going to look at some of the uncertainties in our world and
then explore some ways to gain a little certainty.

We talked about The Uncertainty Recession recently, and that certainly
seems to be the case for the first quarter. We looked at the Atlanta
Fed's GDPNow estimate a few weeks ago and it was indicating a
first-quarter recession. The latest update for their projection is worth
quickly revisiting.

Several comments are in order. First, the Atlanta Fed acknowledges the
impact of gold imports on their GDP forecasts. This week I learned (and
now you will) about how the Atlanta Fed tracks gold. Turns out it is not
straightforward. And that it makes a difference going forward.

I should note that my "edge" in writing this letter is I have fabulous
sources of information (and conversations!) that I have developed over
the years. Plus, I am part of several group chats and texts with
seasoned market experts who regularly comment on data and a wide variety
of topics. What I have in addition is my readers who graciously send me
information and ideas.

Reader Robert Merrill actually wrote the caretaker of the Atlanta Fed
GDPNow model, Pat Higgins, who wrote him back. It turns out there are
two sources for importing gold data: the Census Bureau and the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. According to Mr. Higgins, the Census Bureau's numbers
can be quite different because many gold import bars are classified as
finished metal shapes. The BEA classifies them as nonmonetary (for trade
purposes) gold. Higgins said that going forward they will likely make
the switch to the BEA numbers as they are more accurate for their
purpose.

Why does this matter? Right now, you can see that if you use the Census
Bureau numbers for gold they would say that the actual projections would
only show a slight recession. Presumably, the BEA numbers would show a
much deeper downturn.

While the GDPNow can vary widely in the early months, this late in April
with no more data to come in it is highly likely Q1 will show negative
GDP growth. The data could move either way from their projection. If the
final data shows more imports than are currently counted, the downturn
will be deeper. BEA will issue three Q1 GDP estimates over the next
three months, an initial "advance" number later this month, then two
updates. These can change significantly as new data comes in.

I think this recession, if this is the beginning of one, will be
different than the typical business cycle recessions we have experienced
in the past. [Policy uncertainty is causing some businesses to pause
expansion plans, unsure of what tariff and other tax policies will
prevail 6--12--24 months from now.]{.underline}

Not all the data is negative, though. Consumer spending remains solid.
Households and businesses are not overleveraged and still have spending
capacity. However, consumer sentiment is down significantly. Normally
sentiment is reflected in consumer spending. Why the disconnect?

Because consumers and businesses may be spending more to get ahead of
the potential tariffs. Just as high inflation makes consumers spend
today to avoid high prices in the future, potential 25% tariffs (and
much higher for Chinese goods) have the same effect. In essence, if you
know you will need a particular product soon, why not just buy it now?

[The Trump administration certainly knows that uncertainty is creating
negative pressure on the economy.]{.underline} They are clearly trying
to reshape the global trading order, but it is, well, uncertain what it
will look like when they are finished. Will it be a world of more open
and balanced trade? Or a world of trade within silos because tariffs
force businesses all over the world to adjust supply chains?

[The Trump administration seemingly believes it can resolve the tariff
issues in 3 to 6 months, removing the uncertainty currently plaguing the
system]{.underline}. They are clearly willing to suffer a recession if
need be in order to restructure the global trading system. The removal
of uncertainty will certainly spur a great deal of economic activity and
growth. If you combine that with scaling back the regulatory deep state,
it could produce an environment where manufacturing grows significantly.
That seems to be their bet.

HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - [U.S. oil and gas companies are
**unlikely to expand development** in Alaska and the Arctic following
President Donald Trump\'s executive order enabling them to do so,
company officials and industry representatives told Reuters, noting a
future president could easily reverse Trump\'s move.]{.underline} U.S.
oil production is already at record levels due largely to increased
production in more accessible areas like Texas and New Mexico, and
companies have limited spending on new projects to focus on returning
cash to shareholders. [\"Many of these areas have been closed for a good
long while,\"]{.underline} said Dustin Meyers, senior vice president of
policy at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organization that
represents major oil firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp, and
ConocoPhillips. \"There is always the risk that these areas could be
reclosed after the next election cycle,\" he said, adding that is the
key issue that could temper interest from oil companies in the short
term to pursue new drilling projects there. [Drilling in the Arctic and
Alaska is a high-risk endeavor, involving decades of work and billions
of dollars of investment]{.underline}. Exxon (XOM.N), opens new tab,
Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab, Conoco (COP.N), opens new tab, and
Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N), opens new tab did not comment. Conoco is
among the most active oil companies in Alaska's Arctic, and secured a
federal approval from the Biden administration for its \$8 billion
Willow project there in 2023, angering environmental groups. The U.S.
drilling industry trade group AXPC also did not comment. A source at one
major U.S. oil company, who asked not to be named discussing the matter,
said [many companies are unlikely to pursue projects in Alaska based on
Trump\'s executive order alone, seeking long-term certainty like an act
of Congress]{.underline}. Energy consultancy Rystad said Trump's use of
the \"drill, baby, drill\" mantra in his inauguration speech
overestimates the industry\'s willingness to prioritize growth over
generating shareholder returns. [Drilling in Alaska\'s pristine Arctic
refuge has long been a source of friction between Alaska lawmakers and
tribal corporations seeking to open more acres to drilling to spur
economic growth, and Democratic presidential administrations that sought
to preserve the local ecosystem and wildlife.]{.underline} A 2017 tax
law during Trump\'s first term mandated oil and gas lease sales in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a 19 million-acre sanctuary for species
including polar bears and Porcupine caribou. But interest has been
sparse. [The Biden Interior Department received no bids from energy
companies last year when it offered 400,000 acres of the refuge, the
minimum amount required.]{.underline} ANWR's wild landscape lacks roads
and public facilities, but its 1.6 million-acre coastal area along the
Beaufort Sea is estimated to have up to 11.8 billion barrels of
recoverable oil, enough to supply the U.S. for more than a year and a
half at current rates. Before leaving office this month, Biden banned
new offshore oil and gas drilling in federal waters off the East and
West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of the northern
Bering Sea in Alaska. The move was considered mostly symbolic since it
mainly covered zones that have no important prospects. Trump issued an
order seeking to repeal those protections. Still, the energy industry is
\"cautiously optimistic\" that the Trump administration will continue
easing regulations that have hampered oil and gas development, said
API\'s Meyers. \"The administration deserves a lot of credit for at
least doing everything that they can do to send the signal that these
areas are going to be open for development,\" he said.

**NAIP 23** \[Native Americans in Philanthropy, 11-14-2023,
\"Public-Private Partnerships: Unlocking the Potential For Tribal
Communities,\" No Publication,
https://nativephilanthropy.org/blog/public-private-partnerships-unlocking-the-potential-for-tribal-communities,
accessed 7-22-2025\]

This June marks the one-year anniversary of the passage of the
historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested substantial
federal dollars in Tribal Nations, and it was followed by the Inflation
Reduction Act, which passed a couple months later. Through these two
laws, the federal government has dedicated funding directly to
Tribes, providing nearly \$14 billion for various projects, including
critical infrastructure like roads and bridges, access to clean drinking
water, and action on climate change and environmental justice;
prioritizing Tribal communities who have often been left behind. 

This is a good start, [but philanthropy can help catalyze]{.underline}
so much more good **[work that is already happening]{.underline}**. If
philanthropy follows the lead of the federal government and prioritizes
investments in Tribal Nations and Indigenous-led organizations,
particularly opportunities that support Tribes' access to these new
federal resources, the result could be transformational. Public-private
partnerships are the framework we need to not only keep this momentum
going, but accelerate long-term, sustainable Indigenous leadership and
capacity. The framework isn't new, but has been underutilized to support
Tribal-led initiatives and causes. These partnerships, when done right,
allow Tribes to lead and use their knowledge to collectively benefit our
communities.

Coupled with the formation of the [Office of Strategic
Partnerships]{.underline} (OSP) within the Department of the Interior,
**[the federal government is building bridges between government,
philanthropy, and Tribal communities]{.underline}**. OSP and the new
federal spending bills offer **[long-term opportunities to develop
public-private partnerships that support tribal
economies]{.underline}**, environmental stewardship, education, and
more. These were big wins for funding for Tribal communities, but the
work cannot end here. This is the moment for philanthropy to join in and
invest in public-private partnerships. 

The impact speaks for itself. For example, **[the America the Beautiful
Challenge, made possible with new funding from the Inflation Reduction
Act and Infrastructure law]{.underline}**,
**[recently ]{.underline}awarded funds to the United Keetoowah Band of
Cherokee[ in Oklahoma for river ecosystem restoration and promote
connection to Keetoowah traditional practices]{.underline}**, and
the [Igiugig Village Council received a grant]{.underline} to build up
Indigenous-led environmental monitoring in Southwest Alaska.  With
funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the Indian Health
Service within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
allocated [\$700 million to Tribes]{.underline} for the improvement of
water and sanitation systems. This funding, driven by demand from Tribal
leaders, will have vast improvements on health outcomes for Tribes by
increasing Indigenous access to safe water and wastewater disposal. 

As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Confederated Tribes of
the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon [received funding from the US
Department of Agriculture to help with forest restoration**. This put an
explicit emphasis on Indigenous leadership for conservation,
restoration, and co-stewardship of the environment to help fight the
impacts of climate change.**]{.underline} One lane of funding will help
revive Tribal fire practices to address out-of-control fires and tap
into traditional knowledge of forest management -- supporting the growth
and health of several keystone species and plants. Other funding
priorities include Tribal-led initiatives protecting cultural resources,
reducing hazardous fuels and promoting ecosystem and watershed health.
But this \$12 million, specifically for fulfillment of the [Tribal
Forest Protection Act (2004)]{.underline}, will be allocated to over 30
Tribes. While this investment will have a marked impact on the
environment in these areas---and cement the importance and expertise of
Indigenous leadership---this funding will be spread thin. 

T**[he inclusion of extra funds from private organizations could boost
the efficacy of programs]{.underline}** like these from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, **[ensuring Tribal sovereignty and uplifting
Indigenous leadership when it comes to protecting our
planet]{.underline}**. Many **[private organizations have already taken
steps to encourage education for philanthropy]{.underline}** on these
opportunities and how to get involved. The Tribal Nations Conservation
Pledge and Fund, borne from the collaboration of Native Americans in
Philanthropy and Biodiversity Funders Group, is one example of an
organization working to streamline philanthropic funding toward federal
projects, educate funders, and remove barriers to funding for Tribal
Nations like match guarantees. 

**[Tribes have struggled with many forms of capacity and infrastructure
for generations]{.underline}**. We finally have potentially
transformational federal investments on the table, but many tribal
communities don't have the capacity to access them. This is where
philanthropy, government, and the Native-led nonprofits that support
tribal governments and communities need to develop innovative
partnerships like the Tribal Nations Conservation Pledge. **[By aligning
tribal government and nonprofit leadership with the right resources,
philanthropy has a massive opportunity to leverage their
impact.]{.underline}**

Funders need to be proactive and seek out education on how to utilize
their resources to invest in Tribal community leadership and capacity
already in place to support Tribal access to funds. We need new,
innovative mechanisms for philanthropy to move funding that will align
with community and federal priorities.

Investments from the federal government in Indigenous leadership, like
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, can
only be the beginning; **[we must utilize all the funding pathways we
can, including public-private partnerships, to ensure this moment is
impactful and lasting.]{.underline}**   More public-private partnerships
**[will also lead to increased recognition of the positive effects of
our Indigenous leadership]{.underline}**---better education and child
welfare practices, action on climate change and conservation, and
economic benefits nationwide. Indigenous progress leads to progress
nationwide, and there's never been a better time for philanthropy to
invest in Tribal communities and Indigenous knowledge for a brighter
future.

Rio Tinto states the group will respond to accounts of [**racism** and
**sexual** violence]{.underline} [within]{.underline} its workforce by
expanding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in human resources and
corporate leadership \[48\].

[Mining activities]{.underline} directly [contribute]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the [degradation and destruction of the environment and
Indigenous sacred sites]{.underline}. In May 2020, Rio Tinto knowingly
authorized the blast of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site to expand an
iron-ore mine. The sacred area, known as Juukan Gorge, was heralded as a
"very significant" archeological site with "once-in-a-lifetime
discoveries" \[49\]. A leaked tape revealed leadership at Rio Tinto did
not regret the blast itself, [only the public backlash that
ensued]{.underline} \[50\]. In Australia, Rio Tinto has also been
accused of dumping [Aboriginal artifacts in garbage and **waste
streams**]{.underline} without notifying Aboriginal owners for decades
\[51\].

In the United States, Rio Tinto and BHP currently [face opposition from
Native Americans]{.underline} for their desire to turn the sacred site
Oak Flat into a copper mine through a process called block-caving
\[52\]. Block-caving is a cost-efficient method which involves removing
the bottom of an ore body until the surface eventually collapses in on
itself \[53\].

Additionally, tailings dams [contribute to high rates of pollution and
harm]{.underline}. Methods for storing tailings, [the toxic materials
remaining from a mining project]{.underline}, cause [environmental
harm]{.underline} and can lead to [community disaster]{.underline}. In
2019, the Brumadinho Tailings Dam in Brazil collapsed at an [iron ore
mining complex, **killing** over 200 people and causing **severe**
environmental **damage**]{.underline} \[54\]. A 2017 report from Monga
Bay states that, although much of the data around mining spills and
failures is missing, it is estimated that roughly 340 people have been
killed between 2008 and 2017 by tailings dam collapses \[55\].

At least 23 million people are impacted by metal-mining pollution around
the world \[56\]. When a sulfide-ore mine exposes iron sulfide, it
reacts with surface water and air to create sulfuric acid. The runoff
from both active and abandoned mines can suffer from sulfuric acid
pollution, known as acid mine drainage \[57\]. In the United States,
acid mine drainage is a leading cause of polluted water \[58\].

Although Indigenous peoples only make up 6 % of the global population,
Indigenous communities protect 80 % of the world\'s biodiversity \[59\].
[Indigenous communities will be among the first to face the impacts of
climate change, despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} \[60\]. Within the United States, Indigenous land
density and spread has been lost by 99 %. The land in which [Native
Americans have been displaced]{.underline} to has a higher exposure rate
to climate change risk, such as wildfires, extreme heat, and drought
\[61\]. Indigenous communities across North America, however, continue
to lead in climate change adaptation plans to protect local livelihoods
and ecosystems \[62\]. Now, with domestic mining projects increasing in
number, Native Americans are facing [deep-rooted patterns of
**colonialism**]{.underline} in a contemporary setting \[63\].
