and Aarav Tuli for their work on this file.

Some notes---the 1NC shell is specific to environmental managerialism
but there are military links as well. The alternative can remain the
same for either. There are baseline/WIP blocks for framework and
alternative explanations for the reflection alternative in the 1NC shell
that should be personalized. There are also blocks for other
alternatives below.

### 1nc---k---environmental managerialism

#### Managerialism is the [root cause]{.underline} of [environmental destruction]{.underline}. Continued attempts to control nature for materials or infrastructure risk exploitation [beyond reversal]{.underline}.

The recognition that [[resource managerialism is at the **root
of**]{.mark} **many [environmental problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} often
sparks a reaction among some that calls for a return to the status quo
ante. [The [call is,]{.mark} first, [to]{.mark} **[stop exploiting
Nature]{.mark}**\'s endowments, [and]{.mark} then to [move toward
restoring]{.mark} those sites and [systems]{.mark} that have been [most
abused]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ecological restoration is a very tricky
proposition because what is to be restored, how it will be reclaimed,
who must rehabilitate what has been damaged, and which prior state of
existence is to be privileged with a \"restoration\" all add up to a
series of very difficult choices. Most appeals for restoration are made
on aesthetic grounds, but restoration managerialism also has developed
more macrological engagements for maintaining the integrity of the
Earth\'s carrying capacities. In this respect, [restoration
managerialism focuses upon mobilizing the biological, physical and
social sciences to address the major economic and political effects of
current and future anthropogenic environmental problems]{.underline}.
Their [resourcifications allow [ecosystemic managers]{.mark} to
**[infrastructuralize]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} [Earth]{.mark}\'s ecologies
[in the name of]{.mark} complete [restoration]{.mark} for some biomes,
bioregions or biosystems. The **[Earth becomes]{.mark}**, if only in
terms of contemporary technosciences\' operational assumptions,
[a]{.mark}n immense **[terrestrial engine]{.mark}**. [Serving]{.mark} as
[the]{.mark} [human]{.mark} [race]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} \"ecological
life-support system,\" it has \"with only occasional localized
failures\" provided \"services upon which human society depends
consistently and without charge. This complex system of systems is what
must survive and its outputs include: the [**[generation of
soils]{.mark}, [regeneration]{.mark}** of plant nutrients, **[capture of
solar energy]{.mark}**, conversion of solar energy into biomass,
**[accumulation]{.mark}**/purification/distribution [of
**water**]{.mark}, control of pests, provision of a genetic library,
maintenance of breathable air, **[control of]{.mark}** micro and macro
**[climates]{.mark}**, pollination of plants, diversification of animal
species, **[development of buffering mechanisms]{.mark}** [in
catastrophes]{.mark}, and aesthetic enrichment]{.underline}. \"because
it is the true capital stock of transnational enterprise, the planet\'s
ecology requires highly disciplined engineers and continuous adaptive
management, or terrestrial reengineering, to restore its original
capacities and then guide its subsequent sustainable use. Restoring as
many as possible of those ecosystems that have been damaged is
critically significant, so [restoration [managerialism]{.mark}
[may]{.mark} even [try to bring back]{.mark} almost [extinct
ecosystems]{.mark} **in order [to enlarge existing]{.mark} [carrying
capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. C. Risk Managerialism As Beck suggests,
risk managerialism is now an integral part of the self-critical
production and reproduction of globally thinking, but locally acting,
capitalism. Environmental science trains experts to conceptually
contain, actuarially assess, and cautiously calculate the many
dimensions of ecological risk in the disciplines of ecotoxiology,
environmental assessment, or ecoremediation. Yet, the assumptions of
such modeling techniques only constitute a scientized first take for the
sweep of reflexivity. [Combining practical laboratory experiences and
field studies, risk [managerialism]{.mark} [suggests]{.mark} that all
areas of **[ecological]{.mark} [oversight]{.mark}** [must]{.mark}
**[become risk analysis-centered concerns]{.mark}**, like integrated
**[resource management]{.mark}**, **[conservation]{.mark} biology,**
[and]{.mark} **environmental [risk analysis]{.mark}**. This quantitative
approach to surveillance and evaluation [focuses]{.mark} risk analysis
[on **probabilistic models** of most **preferred futures**]{.mark},
outcomes or practices]{.underline}. Risk management presumes its
calculations \"are based on a (spatially, temporally, and socially
circumscribed) accident definition\" or that its analyses truly do
\"estimate and legitimate the potential for catastrophe of modern
large-scale technologies and industries.\" Superfund site after
supertanker spill after superstack bubble, however, indicate that this
degree of scientific knowledge is precisely what risk management studies
fail to adduce, \"and so they are falsifications, and can be criticized
and reformed in accordance with their own claims to rationality.\" This
[trend toward developing a fully self-conscious risk managerialism
grounded in economistic trade-offs also surfaces in adaptive and
collaborative management. [Such visions of]{.mark} [environmental
science]{.mark} **[recapitulate]{.mark} the [logic]{.mark}** of
technical networks [as they **work for the world**]{.mark}**\'s states**
and [markets]{.mark}. [Rather]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the environment
[surrounding]{.mark} [humanity]{.mark}, the friction-free global
**[marketplace]{.mark}** of transnational capital now is what
**[envelops Nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From its metabolisms,
[[humanity]{.mark} [produce]{.mark}s eco**[toxins]{.mark}**,
**[biohazards]{.mark}**, hydro**[contaminants]{.mark}**,
aeroparticulates, and enviro**poisons** [who]{.mark}se impacts
**[generate inexorable risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Such policy
problematics are unfolding now on the global scale, because
[transnational [markets]{.mark} have **[colonize]{.mark}d** so many more
sites on [the planet]{.mark} as part and parcel of global businesses\'
vision **[for sustainable development]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Well-trained environmental professionals must measure, monitor or manage
these risks, leaving the rational operations of fast capitalism wholly
intact as \"risks won\" for their owners and beneficiaries, while risk
analyses performed by environmental practitioners cope with all the
victims of \"risks lost.\"

#### The impact is [extinction]{.underline}

(Caterina Resta--- professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the University

Society & Science, "The Age of the Totalitarian Domination
of Technology," Chapter 1: 17-18)

[[Technology]{.underline}]{.mark}, insofar as it is a challenge
\[Herausforderung\], [[requires]{.mark} from [nature]{.mark} its
resources]{.underline}, in the mode of ordering \[Bestellung\], [[as a
standing-reserve]{.underline}]{.mark} \[Bestand\].
[Ordering]{.underline} \[Be-stellen\] [is done by **computation**, by
virtue of which the earth is commanded to present]{.underline}
\[dar-stellen\] [itself. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} mandatory
'presentation' [[forces the earth]{.mark} [to make itself]{.mark}
[available for]{.mark} our [unlimited
exploitatio]{.mark}n]{.underline}**.** This is why Heidegger would call
the non-technological essence of technology Ge-stell, in the sense of
the meeting \[Versammlung\] of the different ways of placing
\[stellen\], through which man requests and provokes the real. **[The
fact that the real now presents itself as a standing reserve \[Bestand\]
involves [the transformation of beings from objects to reserves]{.mark}
of materials and energies that are available to us, usable, and [ready
for]{.mark} use and [consumption]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Technology is
this imperious command that [**violently attacks the earth** in]{.mark}
its **[totality]{.mark}**, for the sole purpose of enhancing its
power]{.underline}, and therefore is [[**completely indifferent** to
the]{.mark} **catastrophic** and **[destructive outcomes]{.mark}** of
its devastating work]{.underline}. All [this does not concern the fate
of a people or a continent alone]{.underline}: as already Jünger had
noted, in addition to its total nature, technology also has a
**planetary** nature -- today we would say global -- that goes
**beyond** geo-historical boundaries, **unifying** the earth in a
single, universal language. While technological power unveiled its
destructive character in the wars of matériel \[Materialkriege\] of the
first half of the twentieth century, then conversely [[the violence of
an **unconditional will to power**]{.underline} **[has become the truth
of technology]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, even in
peacetime.]{.underline}**

#### The alternative is to step back from calculative thinking and reground meditative thinking as foundational connection betwixt being and nature -- the intrinsic value of the environment is prior to the instrumental value of the bodies within it

E. **[[The 'Step Back']{.underline}]{.mark}** as a 'Step Towards'
Confronting Global Warming Heidegger directly speaks to this notion of a
'step back' in many of his works, but particularly in his 1957 essay
entitled "The Onto-Theo-Logical Constitution of Metaphysics". He says,
"**[The step back points to the realm which until now has been skipped
over, and from which the essence of truth becomes first of all worthy of
thought"]{.underline}** (1969 \[1957\], 49). [Stepping back out of
positionality, out of solely calculative thinking, out of the plans and
schedules of our daily lives, provides an entirely new perspective on
how we relate to the world, on how we live in this world, that will
enable us to see certain aspects of our world in an altogether new
dimension.]{.underline} This step back allows us to pull out of the
systematically rigid, planned, and positioned world that consumes us.
**[Through this step back and meditative thinking, we can begin to live
resonantly through releasement, escaping the shackles of technology that
currently overpower and define our being]{.underline}**. [Even if we
learn to have this comportment towards things engendered through
releasement and become capable of living with technology rather than as
slaves to it, will this be sufficient; **will global warming cease being
a danger?**]{.underline} Many people would argue that **[[technology
must be reformed and transformed altogether]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for
**[[even if we learn to live with technology, the levels of greenhouse
gases emitted]{.mark} by the technological devices we use [on a daily
basis is]{.mark} simply [unsustainable.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As
mentioned earlier, though, Heidegger 42 accepts the technological
direction of history and realizes that [we cannot simply eliminate
technological devices from our daily lives;]{.underline} **[we cannot
instantaneously revert to a preIndustrial, agrarian
society]{.underline}**. However, **[failure to revive our meditative
thinking means that calculative thinking would continue to
dominate]{.underline}** the way we think, **[thereby only
exacerbating]{.underline}** the levels of **[consumption, utility,
application, and positionality]{.underline}** that define the modern
technological world. **[[Failure to 'step back'
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[persistence of calculative thinking
would]{.underline}]{.mark}** only **[[keep us on the same path]{.mark};
[global warming would]{.mark}]{.underline}** only [[increase]{.mark} and
we would stand little hope of preserving our environment.]{.underline}
[[Releasement]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[while it represents a
non-willing]{.underline}, **[does not mean that the will ceases to exist
altogether]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [While one can be open to the mystery
of the world, one can also live his or her life but take that which
presences and ascribe meaning to it through a meditative
thinking]{.underline}. **[[This means]{.mark} that [in letting being
be,]{.mark} [the true essence of being]{.mark} breathes freely and
[reveals itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In the context of the modern
technological world, we release ourselves to the world by letting the
technical devices and phenomena---cell phones, automobiles, power
plants, the motorized food industry etc.---enter our lives so that we
can understand exactly how they fit into our world.]{.underline} Through
such an understanding, we may begin to see those technical devices and
phenomena from a new perspective, one that may inspire us to modify them
in such a way that we can more essentially guard being. Indeed[, global
warming fundamentally threatens being; if our roles as shepherds of
being means protecting being from that which threatens it, then we must
address this culture of modernity overrun by calculative thinking and
rooted in global warming]{.underline}. **[[Releasement towards things
enables us to live with technology]{.underline}]{.mark}** because 43
**[[it enlightens us on the very dangers inherent in modern technology
but separate from its essence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Heid[egger does
not intend to suggest that we can provide a quick and easy solution to
global warming merely through changing the way we think. He recognizes
the scope and force of technology, and feels this danger in all its
power]{.underline}. H[**owever, [adjusting the way we live]{.mark} our
lives [represents a necessary step towards preventing global
warming]{.mark} [from destroying our earth]{.mark}.** [We cannot solve
this problem through]{.mark} continually [applying]{.mark} metaphysical
methods involving [calculation]{.mark}s, statistics, and numbers [to the
objectified]{.mark} and alienated [environment]{.mark} around
us[.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Such thinking]{.mark} still [resides in
the]{.mark} calculative and positioned [culture of modernity that
prevents]{.mark} us from [coexisting]{.mark} meditatively [with
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This 'step towards' hampering global
warming]{.underline} and 'step back' to the realm of meditative thinking
that has been skipped over will lead to careful activity in the spirit
of guarding being and our nature. Heidegger says in his Letter on
Humanism[, "Thinking comes to an end when it slips out of its
element...Said plainly, thinking is the thinking of Being]{.underline}"
(1993 \[1947\], 220). He proceeds to say at the end of his letter,
"[[Thus thinking is a deed]{.mark}.]{.underline} But **[[a deed
that]{.mark} also [surpasses all praxis]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Thinking towers above action and production,]{.underline}** not
through the grandeur of its achievement and not as a consequence of its
effect, but **[through the humbleness of its inconsequential
accomplishment"]{.underline}** (262). **[[Thus, thinking is an action,
the highest action]{.underline}]{.mark}**, insofar **[[as it is a
thinking of Being]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has been forgotten in
our current age. But **[[this]{.mark} thinking]{.underline}** of Being
**[[does not mean that 'deeds' or everyday praxis cease to]{.mark} exist
or cease to [have]{.mark} any [significance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
our daily lives. [[Rather, deeds are now enriched due to]{.mark} the
deed, [thinking, which allows one to access 44
Being]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Deeds undertake]{.mark} a more careful
role in our lives and have [more meaning]{.mark} behind them since they
have [been thought in relation]{.mark} [to
Being]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [**[Does this mean that through
meditative]{.underline}** **[thinking we will all arrive at the same
solution]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** the same relation to
being **[and adopt universal deeds that everyone supports? [Presumably
not.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Some people may be inspired to become
hermits and radically limit or virtually eliminate the role of
technology in their lives altogether; others may adopt certain habits
that they believe frees them from technology's authority; and others may
devote themselves to developing new technical devices that do not
deplete so many resources and do not distance us from Being. However one
changes his or her deeds, what remains consistent is that the person has
now adopted an ethic of care, has now freed himself from technology's
dominion, has recognized the danger in positionality and the largely
calculative culture of modernity, and has transformed his or her
activity so that it resides closer to the human's essential nature.
**[[This way of being grants us the opportunity to save our
environment]{.mark}, if and only if the distress is felt widely and
profoundly, and may be what Heidegger had in mind when he called for us
to say 'yes and no' to technology.]{.underline}** F. How **[to Say 'Yes'
and 'No' to Technology]{.underline}** **[[Heidegger's]{.mark} thoughts
on technology may seem utterly abstract and impractical, in that he
[never provides any specific plans t]{.mark}owards confronting
particular devices or processes[--- e.g. reduce carbon emissions to 'x'
level per year, only use public transportation, etc.--- because such
suggestions still reside in the metaphysical
realm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Heidegger recognizes a deeper and more
prevalent issue]{.mark};]{.underline}** **[[our way of relating to the
world as]{.mark} measurable, as [standing
reserve]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as not yet applied, **[and as not yet
consumed]{.underline}**. **[[Solutions, then, cannot]{.mark} 45 solely
[focus on specific device]{.mark}s because [these devices are only
objectified symptoms and reflections of a larger, cultural
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Our efforts must also be
directed towards attending to]{.underline}** this culture of [modernity
that threatens both man's essence and our environment]{.underline}. So
[what does Heidegger's philosophy offer us?]{.underline} It offers a
view of the world that has been overlooked by many due to the speed and
lack of thought that pervades society. **[[It shows]{.mark} the
ubiquitous positionality and [treatment of things as standing
reserve]{.mark} that [has been unthought]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [And it
highlights the danger in this way of relating to the world---
particularly to man's essence]{.underline}, **[but also to 'the thing'
itself]{.underline}**. Heidegger calls us to meditatively think on this
culture---think on our constant application and consumption and
'release' ourselves to being ---before it is too late. [Global warming
cannot be prevented if we continue allowing technological devices to
dominate our lives and remain trapped in this positioned
world]{.underline}. **[[Everyone must step back and reflect on the
technological culture of modernity]{.mark}, including politicians, CEOs,
and world leaders]{.underline}**. [Through meditative thinking we will
find ways to say yes and, at the same time, no to technology---**coexist
with it---and appreciate the natural materials and environment from
which our devices originated**]{.underline}. Through meditative thinking
people will find ways to balance the technology that we have today with
our roles as shepherds, guardians, and thoughtful creatures inhabiting
this earth. [Part of this lies in preparing the site for the clearing of
Being]{.underline}. [Saying yes and no to technology means that our
activity within such a technological world cannot be focused on the
application of things as standing reserve; rather, our essential
activity of thinking will help allow us to clear the cluttered,
positioned world and let Being shine into our lives]{.underline}. While
some of us immersed in this 46 fast-paced, technological world may view
this as a sacrifice[, such changes will actually bring us nearer to the
thing, closer to our essential space, and will preserve our
environment.]{.underline} **[[Without appreciating Heidegger's call for
meditative thinking]{.mark} and stepping back out of our current
culture, [we will remain slaves to positionality and]{.mark} all that
comes with it, namely [global warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** III.
Pragmatism: The Necessity for Green Policy and Education [If you care
enough for a result, you will most certainly attain it]{.underline}.15
-William James (1842-1910) A. Reconciling Pluralistic Attitudes and
Scientific Opinion Up to this point we have explored existential
theories of responsibility, social ontology, and Heidegger's philosophy
of technology as each relates to global warming. But **[what about
public policy;]{.underline}** [what about the formal laws that often
dictate the norms and behavior of citizens within a
society?]{.underline} As we discussed in the first chapter, a green
revolution is in order. A green revolution will demand action that
alters the state of our current nation and reevaluates our laws towards
sustainability. According to Thomas Friedman, the green revolution will
hopefully transform laws, thereby causing a dramatic change in the
social consciousness of this country. Friedman said, in comparing the
civil rights movement to a potential green movement, "Ultimately, it was
about changing laws, so that no one had an option to discriminate, and
it was those laws that ultimately changed the behavior and consciousness
of tens of millions of people. But the civil rights movement started
with citizen activism" (398). In order for such a green revolution to
occur, as was the case with the civil rights movement, citizen activism
in the form of a strong social ensemble resembling Sartre's group must
emerge. 15 James, William. Talks to Teachers on Psychology: And to
Students on Some of Life's Ideals. New York: Henry Holt and Company,
1921 \[1899\], p. 137. 48 But, alas, we are forgetting an important part
of this story: What, exactly, will these green laws entail; how will the
government legislate sustainability? [It is beyond the scope of this
paper to speculate on the efficacy and economics of potential policies
like a **carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system**.]{.underline} While
**[[new legislation]{.mark} certainly [will not resolve Heidegger's
concerns about our loss of meditative thinking and]{.mark} treatment of
[things as standing reserve]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[it
may]{.underline}**]{.mark} still contribute significantly towards
[[minimiz]{.underline}]{.mark}ing our [[greenhouse gas emissions]{.mark}
and fighting global warming.]{.underline} **[[However, before any law
can ever realistically be pushed through Congress, a change in the
attitude and beliefs towards our environment must
occur.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Pragmatism, a largely American philosophy,
promotes the belief that we should seek to bring our diverse values,
experiences, and perspectives into a harmonious pluralism. For
pragmatists, policy serves as a powerful tool for meeting the challenges
we experience in society. As Dr. John Stuhr, a scholar in American
pragmatism, says regarding the pragmatist's view towards philosophy:
\[I\]t must be practical, critical, and reconstructive; it must aim at
the successful transformation or amelioration of the experienced
problems which call it forth and intrinsically situate it, and its
success must be measured in terms of this goal. Thus, for the classical
American philosophers, philosophy is primarily an instrument for the
ongoing critical reconstruction of daily practice. (3) Philosophy must
reside close to our experience and serve to change our environment in
such a way that the problems plaguing society can be overcome through
constructive activity. Thus, pragmatism is very much a "doer's"
philosophy and does not promote the traditional image of an intellectual
lost in theory, detached from the world that surrounds him; rather,
pragmatists wish to shake the very norms and rules of society if such a
change is called for. 49 But how can a pragmatic, policy-oriented
approach to global warming that also accepts the plurality of attitudes,
beliefs, and values in this country ever result in any action without
undermining the very diversity of opinion on global warming? In other
words, what sort of compromise, or harmonious pluralism, could possibly
exist between people with fundamentally conflicting ideologies: those
who adamantly believe in global warming and those who just as vigorously
reject it? To make this question even more difficult to answer, research
suggests that within the last decade a growing disparity between
partisan ideologies over global warming has occurred. The trends
indicate that Republicans are becoming increasingly skeptical of global
warming while Democrats are becoming increasingly convinced of its
reality. 16 This trend was just recently epitomized in a bill (H.R. 910)
authored by Republican Ed Whitfield, chairman of the Subcommittee on
Energy and Power, that was approved and sent to the House of
Representatives. The bill intends to prevent the Environmental
Protection Agency from managing greenhouse gas emissions. According to
an editorial in a major journal entitled "Into Ignorance", during a
recent subcommittee hearing on March 14, "Misinformation was presented
as fact, truth was twisted and nobody showed any inclination to listen
to scientists, let alone learn from them."17 The article proceeds to
say: "That this legislation is unlikely to become law doesn\'t make it
any less dangerous. It is the attitude and ideas behind the bill that
are troublesome, and they seem to be spreading" (266). **[These growing
[anti global-warming bills]{.mark} only [exacerbate the political
stalemate that continues to block progress and
change.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The 16 See: Dunlap, Riley E. "Partisan
Gap on Global Warming Grows," Gallup, Inc., posted on their website in
May, 2009. See bibliography for more details. 17 Editorial, "Into
Ignorance," Nature. 471: 265-266. 50 "attitude" behind this
bill---namely, that global warming either is not real or that it does
not pose any sort of threat to us or our environment---exemplifies the
very lack of distress felt in our society over this pressing issue. [We
again come back to this same question: how can we foster a plurality of
beliefs and find a harmonious pluralism when political ideologies clash
so fundamentally; **[how can government representatives]{.mark}
[make]{.mark} any sort of [progress when such a blatant partisan divide
exists?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Unfortunately **[there is no easy
solution to this problem.]{.underline}** Many **[citizens feel
demoralized]{.underline}** and pessimistic [precisely because of this
very clear dissension within our government]{.underline}. Ironically,
though, the scientific community is virtually unanimous on global
warming; 97-98% of active climate researchers believe that climate
change has resulted from human activities.18 Similarly, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading
international body for the assessment of climate change, argued in a
2001 report that anthropogenic behavior has caused the rise in global
temperatures. The IPCC, to which thousands of scientists contribute,
stated in the report: "Anthropogenic factors do provide an explanation
of 20th century temperature change...\[and\] it is unlikely that
detection studies have mistaken a natural signal for an anthropogenic
signal."19 Some scientists, in fact, believe that the IPCC's report
erred on 18 See: Anderegg, W. and Prall, J. "Expert Credibility in
Climate Change" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America, published online June 21, 2010. 19 IPCC Third
Assessment Report, "Climate Change 2001," co-ordinating lead authors:

chapter 12, section 6 for these quotes. More details in bibliography. 51
the moderate side and underestimated the effects that may occur from
warming the planet.20 So, what will it take for the virtually unanimous
scientific opinion to translate into political belief and action? In
other words, what will it take to persuade Republican officials that
global warming is real and caused by us? We have already mentioned the
need for us to unite through a green revolution, but the strength of
this movement is lacking right now due to this tension in public and
political opinion about climate change. [Ultimately, the pluralistic
attitudes towards global warming must collapse into a more unified
belief in its reality]{.underline}. As Trevors and Saier Jr. state in a
journal article entitled "A Vaccine Against Ignorance," lies against
global warming continue to be disseminated even though the scientific
evidence is "unequivocal."21 **[[The solution]{.mark} they propose:
[education]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} They say,
"**[Humanity]{.underline}** certainly **[needs to be immunized with a
vaccine for ignorance,]{.underline}** and we propose that **[the vaccine
is education."]{.underline}** Thus, the last two sections of this
chapter will investigate two necessary areas of education on global
warming. The first area of education must be in public awareness;
ensuring that the public has been exposed to the large body of
scientific data that shows the anthropogenic cause of global warming[.
[Once public awareness increases]{.mark} and people become better
informed, [a more unified societal attitude towards global warming
**that resembles a Sartrean group**]{.mark} (]{.underline}rather than
our current Sartrean collective) **[[is more likely to emerge and
politicians]{.mark} may [then be swayed by public pressure]{.mark} and
opinion.]{.underline}** The other area of **[education must
stress]{.underline}** the need for **[a greater appreciation of our
natural environment]{.underline}**---it must remind us of our humble 20

within this earth's dynamic whole, and call attention to the positioned,
technological world that impairs an ethic of care towards our
environment. B. Ignorance is bliss? Concern for the environment has only
recently taken on serious form in the United States. Certainly early
American philosophers such as Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman wrote
beautiful and flowery prose that revered nature, helping us garner a
more profound appreciation for our natural environment. Likewise, Aldo
Leopold's influential essay written in the early 20th century entitled
"The Land Ethic" argued for an environmental ethic that preserves the
"integrity, stability, and beauty" of the biotic community.22 However,
the event that really captured the attention of the public and
government was Rachel Carson's 1962 publication of Silent Spring. 23
Many credit this book, which focused on the detrimental effects of the
pesticide DDT in our environment, with launching contemporary
environmentalism and influencing the government to form the
Environmental Protection Agency. So how was this book able to generate
the grassroots environmental movement that led to the environmentalism
many people identify with today? For one, the book brought public
awareness to a practice that had not yet been carefully evaluated. In a
very straightforward way, it educated the public; it enhanced everyone's
knowledge of a pesticide that people knew generally little to nothing
about. This was exactly Al Gore's mission in his campaign against global
warming---to educate 22 We will return to Leopold's ethic in part C of
this chapter. 23 de Steiguer, Edward J. The Origins of Modern
Environmental Thought. Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 2006, p. 1.
53 the general public on a phenomenon of which most people were
ignorant. In the first chapter, I mentioned that the public can be
broken down into two main groups: those who are cognizant of their
actions in how they contribute to global warming and those who either
deny it or are altogether uninformed. [Before Al Gore started his
campaign, the percentage of the public that fit the latter group---those
who deny global warming or are uniformed---was significantly higher than
it is now.]{.underline} [Gore, like Carson, presented a clear argument,
using strong supporting data and leading scientific literature to offer
a compelling case for the reality of climate change, and ultimately
convinced millions that this issue should not be
overlooked.]{.underline} With that said, about a quarter of the
population still remains unconvinced that climate change deserves
careful attention and action.24 Another powerful component of Silent
Spring was the clarity and concreteness of Carson's explanation of the
danger of DDT. We have already spoken at length about the lack of
distress felt across our country regarding climate change. The
difference between the harmful effects of DDT versus climate change,
however, lies in the manifestation of those effects. [People were able
to appreciate the danger of DDT precisely because Carson showed a clear,
visible link between DDT and animal health]{.underline} (particularly in
birds but also in humans). The manifestation of those effects could be
observed quite directly. As William James said regarding the pragmatic
method, "To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then,
we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the
object may involve---what sensations we are to expect from it, and what
reactions we must prepare" (28). For a pragmatist, the conceivable
effects of an action dictate what is considered true according to an
arrangement of facts (and because 24 de Steiguer, Edward J. Origins,
p. 1. 54 scientific inquiry constantly reveals new results, truth is
never absolute). **[In the case of global warming, unlike DDT, the
effects are not as immediately manifested or as obviously linked to our
actions]{.underline}**. [Because DDT operates on such a small scale
relative to global warming, many people find it easier to comprehend the
causal connection between dangerous chemical use in pesticides and
health.]{.underline} **[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
**[[operates on such a massive scale]{.mark} and results from such an
array of activities so deeply embedded in our society that many [people
fail to connect the cause and effect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In other
words, the arrangement of facts for the case of [DDT was much
simpler]{.mark} and more localized than they are with global
warming]{.underline}. **[Even though the data that Gore and the
scientific community have compiled is quite persuasive]{.underline}**,
**[many people still struggle to find truth in his message because of
this indirect cause and effect relation]{.underline}**.25 This poses the
most significant problem for swaying those deniers of climate change
that the phenomenon is real, but through clear communication and a
transparent presentation of the science behind global warming such a
problem may be overcome. Thus, continuing to educate the public and
encouraging people to join organizations, adjust their lifestyles, and
pressure officials for policy change represents a hopeful path[. We
cannot allow for a quarter of the population to be ignorant regarding
climate change; such ignorance only destroys the natural environment
that many of us have taken for granted and also hinders our ability to
fuse **into a solidified group that can influence political
action.**]{.underline} As the public increases its awareness on global
warming--- through formal education in classrooms, dialogue amongst
friends and family, greater 25 Some people also claim that Gore has
ulterior incentives in his campaign against climate change and thus
construe his message as propaganda. This paper, however, will not
address those claims for they lack evidence and appear to be ungrounded.
55 attention in the media, etc.---the lingering, ignorant belief that it
does not pose a real threat to our environment or that it is altogether
fictitious may evaporate. C. Spreading an Environmental Ethic [The
attitude most people hold toward the environment today is one
characterized by exploitation and use. We spoke about this in the second
chapter, as Heidegger highlighted the businessman and technologist's
relabeling land as a "greenspace"---as a supply]{.underline}. **[If any
sort of progress towards global warming is to be realized, this [current
attitude towards the environment must be altered. Such a
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[should not be for the sole
purpose of preventing global warming;]{.underline}]{.mark}** in other
words, **[[teleological considerations should not be the motivating
factor]{.mark} for changing attitudes]{.underline}**. **[[Rather, a
genuine realization]{.mark} that the environment cannot continue to be
exploited and destroyed at current rates should, in and of itself,
motivate people [to abandon this consumption-driven view of our
environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In an essay entitled "Famine,
Affluence, and Morality", Peter Singer, a contemporary utilitarian
philosopher, argues that the moral scheme of affluent countries must be
reconceptualized. According to Singer, people today consider donations
to charities as an act of "generosity"; Singer says, "The charitable man
may be praised, but the man who is not charitable is not condemned.
People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on
new clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief" (234).
Singer believes this "moral conceptual scheme" must be altered; [an
attitudinal shift must occur in which people no longer view the act of
donating as a "good deed," something "above and beyond" or something
only a "good Samaritan" would do]{.underline}. 56 Instead, he challenges
this very assumption and believes that those of us living in affluent
nations are morally required to help fight these evils. Singer arrives
at this point using utilitarian ethics26, a philosophy Heidegger
strongly opposed due to its inherent calculative, metaphysical nature[.
While Heidegger certainly would not have supported Singer's approach for
this very reason, **the point worth underscoring from Singer's article
is in his demand for a change in our moral attitude---a new "moral
conceptual scheme**]{.underline}". This change in our moral attitude
must occur in how we perceive the environment as well. Often when people
recycle, walk instead of drive, or perform other "green" acts, their
behavior is viewed the same way as that of donating to a charity: as
worthy of moral praise rather than moral requirement. [This, I would
argue, is an attitude characterized by collective bad-faith; we are
deceiving ourselves in believing that such behavior deserves moral
praise when, in actuality, we recognize the moral necessity for this
"green", sustainable attitude]{.underline} (assuming we have been
informed on the dangerous effects of global warming). In other words,
**[we are devaluing our responsibility to preserve the environment and
are deceiving ourselves about the morality of our behavior with regard
to its contribution towards global warming]{.underline}**. So what makes
a "green" attitude and overall care for the environment a moral
requirement? Certainly, as just mentioned, failure to adopt this
attitude will result in increased global warming and more widespread
exploitation of the earth, but, as indicated earlier, **[an ethic of
care should not be adopted solely for these teleological
reasons]{.underline}**. As 26 Singer argues that people in affluent
nations would sacrifice nothing of comparable moral importance were they
to give money to desperate nations such as Bengal that suffer from a
severe lack of food, shelter, and medical care. He believes the consumer
society in America has distorted people's values and that fighting
poverty and hunger far outweigh the consumerism towards which much of
our money has been directed. 57 Tom Regan argues, the environment has an
inherent worth that gives it moral standing, and for this reason we must
adopt a stronger environmental ethic that cares for its value. Regan
claims that in order for a "genuine environmental ethic" to be possible
(as opposed to an ethic for the use of the environment---a distinction
that Regan makes quite clear in his paper) two conditions must be met:
(1) An environmental ethic must hold that there are nonhuman beings
which have moral standing. (2) An environmental ethic must hold that the
class of those beings which have moral standing includes but is larger
than the class of conscious beings. (19-20) This approach to an
environmental ethic clashes with anthropocentric or sentient approaches
that claim only humans or sentient beings (i.e. animals that can feel
pleasure or pain) possess direct moral standin**[g]{.underline}**. Regan
further claims that **[[utilitarian and deontological moral approaches
to the environment fail]{.mark}]{.underline}** because [**[they
exclusively concern sentient beings]{.underline}** (**[utilitarianism)
or humans (deontological]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[)]{.underline}**. He
concludes his essay by saying, "**[the development of what can properly
be called an [environmental ethic requires]{.mark} that we postulate
[inherent value in nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (34). While Regan's
environmental ethic certainly positions us closer to appreciating and
caring for our environment, ultimately Regan falls prey to the very
anthropocentric stances he had criticized. Bruce Foltz, a Heideggerean
scholar, says of Regan's approach, "[Regan undermines and betrays his
own intentions through the employment of concepts such as 'object' and
'value'"]{.underline} (171). [Foltz goes on to say that Regan, along
with many other environmental ethics philosophers, fails to examine the
actual concept of an environment, which he believes involves a "rich set
of interrelations---more than can be comprehended by human ecology or by
geography, literature, politics, theology, philosophy, or any other
science or discipline" (173]{.underline}). **[This sort of environmental
ethic 58 that recognizes the direct moral standing of ecosystems from
their interrelated, functional integrity is often considered an
'ecocentric' ethical approach, and this perspective resides much closer
to Heidegger's thought]{.underline}**. As discussed in the last chapter,
[Heidegger believes we must regain our essence as shepherds of Being and
must dwell poetically with nature, **as opposed to against
it**]{.underline} or for our sole use. [The very Being of all that is
around us involves both living and nonliving things, and each is
mediated through its very interrelations that collectively constitute
the dynamic system that is this earth.]{.underline} As shepherds of
being, Heidegger believes that we must preserve these essential
relations and prepare for the site of the clearing of being rather than
clutter it with excessive technological devices. **[[It cannot be
reiterated enough that saying yes and no to technology does not mean
destroying technology, eliminating calculative thinking altogether, or
disregarding science, but rather it calls for a more appreciative,
essential relation to technology that does not render us its
slaves]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[This]{.underline}** sort of [humble
environmental ethic---one that recognizes the web of beings that
together constitute this earth---has been generally lost in our
contemporary age]{.underline} due to our detachment from nature.
[Heidegger was aware of this]{.underline}; the distress he felt over the
positioned world stemmed from this very change in our relation to the
earth. [However, meditative thinking should remind us of our role within
this dynamic whole and should cause a change in our attitude toward the
environment]{.underline}. As Aldo Leopold, the father of ecocentrism,
said in his essay The Land Ethic: "By and large, our present problem is
one 59 of attitudes and implements."[27 Respect for this earth and an
ethic of care that preserves its integrity and stability must be
instilled in our moral consciousnesses if we wish to poetically dwell
here, and **environmentally conscious actions must be viewed as moral
requirement** rather than as mere preferences]{.underline}. So how can
this sort of attitudinal change occur; how can we encourage people to
meditatively think on their place within this complex, interrelated
earth? In an everincreasing positioned, industrialized world, children
must be encouraged to venture out into the wilderness and explore the
natural habitats that remain generally untouched by technology. As John
Dewey said in his essay Education as Growth, "In directing the
activities of the young, society determines its own future in
determining that of the young."28 This statement states nothing novel,
but it underscores the attention we must pay to our youth so that they
gain exposure to the natural beauty that all too often remains veiled
behind technology and industry. Our education system must not overlook
the importance of this and should encourage school field trips to
national parks and other activities that engage students with natural
ecosystems. Adults, too, have the capacity to occasionally step back
from their busy lives and reconnect with nature. Through experiencing
the world beyond its technological realm, we are more inclined to adopt
an ethic of care for the environment[. **[This ethical approach, coupled
with a more informed]{.underline}**]{.mark} 27 Reprinted in: Timmons,

2 Towards a [**Freudo-Marxist** Theory of Geoengineering]{.underline}

There is now a budding -- to call it rich would be to underrate the
subject matter it has yet to deal with -- [psychoanalytical literature
on the **climate crisis**]{.underline}.43 Its foundational insight,
somewhat like the equivalent of the greenhouse effect in the physical
sciences, [concerns denial. [The **progression** of this crisis is
constituted by **denial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It originated in and is
perpetuated and aggravated by denial in multifarious forms.44 In a
powerful meditation on how it can work, Lee Zimmerman draws on the case
of a dream reported by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams: a father
was watching his child's sick-bed for days and nights on end, until the
child died. The father then moved into the next room, to a bed from
which he could see the corpse laid out. After a few hours of sleep, he
had a 'dream that his child was standing beside his bed, caught him by
the arm and whispered to him reproachfully, "Father, don't you see I'm
burning?".'45 In Zimmerman's reading, the child's question captures the
essence of the denial of the ongoing catastrophe. 'Don't you see that I
am burning?', the red-hot child asks the father, entreating him to open
his eyes and intervene before the body is consumed, but despairing about
his willingness to do so. Is he even mentally present, there at the
bedside? Or has he turned away from the trauma in front of him?

[The essence of denial, on this view, is the shutting out of a [reality
too painful to take in: the climate catastrophe is a **trauma in
motion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and like the father in the eyes of his
dying child, people in capitalist society respond by turning away from
it. They develop a myriad of strategies for knowing what is going on and
at the same time not knowing.46 They keep on living as normal, as though
nothing deeply troubling was happening in front of their eyes, no child
set on fire; and only because they behave in this fashion can the
burning progress towards its end. Had they intervened in time, they
could have doused the flames. [Such [denial is a **psychic** process at
the level of the **individual**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but above all --
on this the literature is in resounding agreement -- it is organised or
produced, by material and ideological processes distinctive to a
capitalist society based on fossil fuels. Denial is not an idiosyncrasy
or private pathology, but a certificate of membership in this particular
society, a kind of credit card, perhaps, necessary for moving around in
it and accessing its commodities and living without going crazy.47

Importantly, this denial is protean enough to embrace all classes. It
can be exercised by the most villainous personifications of fossil
capital as well as the most innocent subalterns at the base of the
pyramid. It can cloak crime and failure. As for the former, a sense of
omnipotence [breeds a [**refusal** to acknowledge an **external
world**]{.mark} that belies it]{.underline}. Sally Weintrobe, a pioneer
of psychoanalytical climate studies, has recently emphasised this
aspect: [[people]{.mark} on top of the pile cannot own up to a crisis
resolvable only by them stepping down, and so 'they [live in a
bubble-like **psychic retreat** from reality]{.mark}]{.underline}.' To
those who feel entitled to the gifts of the fossil economy, the full
reality of climate breakdown is 'anathema'.48 There is a photograph less
famous than it should be, of three golfers -- with calm composure, to
all appearances -- putting while the hillside behind them is aglow with
fire. Taken during the 2017 wildfire season in the Pacific Northwest,
the shot unsubtly captures the bubble as it approaches bursting point:
should we pack away our golf clubs, just because the world around us is
on fire?49 A talk show host at a Canadian golf programme chose these
words to accompany the picture: 'So many natural disasters, poor people
in Houston, poor people in Florida, it also continues in Oregon and the
west coast of Canada, the wildfires -- and look at these guys, they are
finishing their round, maybe 600 or 700 yards away from this fire. They
have to be ... absolutely ... insane', but it is an insanity that rarely
raises eyebrows, a psychopathology at one with life as such for dominant
classes.50 It became spectacular in the golf photo because it was caught
in a moment at once overly typical and untypical

By far the more common case is that the fire rages at a distance. The
burning child can normally be regarded from a safe room, noticed,
ignored, forgotten without risk. In this type of denial, there is a
salient callousness or, as Adorno would have it, 'coldness, the basic
principle of bourgeois subjectivity' -- the father as cold onlooker.51
Dominant classes have a renowned capacity to turn on the 'blindness of
the seeing eye' (Freud) when faced with the suffering that they
themselves cause.52 Here the trauma against which denial protects would
be the loss of fossilised privilege.53

On the other hand, those most utterly deprived of any such privilege
have their own reason to slump into denial. For them, it is the
powerlessness that is so agonising. They, or 'we find ourselves
overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crisis, and by the enormity of the
power and money arrayed against those who want to turn a corner to keep
our planet liveable for all', Donna Orange observes.54 Here the trauma,
prototypical for psychoanalysis, is helplessness -- the father genuinely
incapable of helping his burning child, in possession of no means for
intervention and unable to bear the pain of recognising it. Between
these opposite class positions of denial, as it were, there are all
sorts of intermediate locations and articulations, coming together in a
society-wide psychopathology of everyday life. The ideas of this epoch
as of every other are the ruling ideas -- the ideas, that is, of the
class that rules and plays golf as the world burns. 'In the minds of the
subjects, too, [a bourgeois society will choose **total destruction**,
its objective potential, rather than rise to reflections that would
threaten its basic stratum]{.underline}' (Adorno).55

[[Denial, then, is a **structural condition** in]{.mark} a capitalist
[society making its way towards]{.mark} unmitigated out-and-out [climate
emergency]{.mark}]{.underline}. It encompasses a much wider set of
practices than the literal, organised denialism now predominantly found
on the far right. More prevalent may be the interpretive form of denial:
climate change exists, but it isn't much of a problem. More universal
still is the implicatory version.56 Here the father does not say
anything to deny or downplay the fact that the child is burning -- he
merely acts as if it were not the case, standing there next to the bed,
his attention focused elsewhere. He might just be going about his day.
He might be finishing his round. In the circumstances, that, too, counts
as a flight from reality.

And flight from reality is the hallmark of the irrational. Conversely,
rationality can be defined, with Adorno, 'as the organ of adjustment to
reality -- or, as contemporary psychoanalysis calls it, testing
reality'.57 It is the faculty by which the subject recognises and tests
reality and adjusts her actions to what she finds there -- limits,
demands, opportunities -- or, the part of the mind that manoeuvres
through the reality principle, not ignoring it, not repudiating it. The
innumerable antithetical ways of being are the professional
preoccupations of psychoanalysis. 'Every neurosis has the effect, and so
probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of
alienating him from reality', Freud remarks. The flight spans the gamut
of disorders, from the neurotic who 'turns away from reality because he
finds either the whole or parts of it unbearable' to the hallucinatory
psychotic who 'attempts to deny the event that has triggered his
insanity'. In either case, and in all cases in between, 'we are
presented with the task of studying the developments of the relationship
of neurotics -- and mankind in general -- to reality': psychoanalysis as
the study of the fate of the rational in humanity.58

That faculty has not fared well recently. Weintrobe quite adequately
dates a turning-point to the 1980s, the decade when the climate crisis
(and other aspects of the ecological crisis) entered the consciousness
of capitalist society, never again to leave it in peace, insisting on
real limits coming closer: and precisely in this moment, neoliberalism
opened up venues for fleeing. Through deregulation and privatisation,
organised denialism and the cult of egoism, it encouraged aggressive
escape from reality. Nearly half a century later, the cumulative result,
Weintrobe goes so far as saying, is a 'collective psychosis'.59 [It
follows that the [climate crisis is determined by irrational
forces]{.mark} through and through -- and into this forcefield, the
**rationalist-optimists** throw their project]{.underline}, with hopes
that amount to giving a hallucinatory psychotic the keys to a nuclear
power-plant, or even the codes to an atomic bomb, and expecting that it
will work out just fine. A more promising approach might be to [[analyse
**geoengineering** as a spin-off of those forces]{.mark}
themselves]{.underline}.

2.1 [From **Denial** to **Repression**]{.underline}

To see geoengineering in this light, we might use a little help from the
second, political generation of psychoanalysts. Based in Berlin during
the Weimar years, they were animated by a belief in the self-evident
affinity between psychoanalysis and Marxism, moved in Communist circles,
offered therapy to the proletariat and fought the onrushing catastrophe.
If they had a credo, it was that psychic processes are subject to the
vagaries of history.60 One of their most brilliant minds was Edith
Jacobson -- anti-fascist activist, feminist, sex therapist counselling
working-class youth in Berlin, stubborn enough to stay after the
Machtergreifung. The Gestapo nabbed her in 1936, but she became so ill
in prison that the Nazi authorities let her out, at which point her
friends whisked her away to the US; like the rest of her generation, she
is all but forgotten today.61 She is also the author of perhaps the
clearest attempt to parse the relation between denial and repression.

[There comes a point when [denial shades into
repression]{.mark}.]{.underline} The two processes are functionally
related, but not identical. For Jacobson, denial targets outside
reality. Repression specialises in internal drives. The former works on
a broad, 'global' canvass, whereas the latter has more of a laser-focus.
More significantly, however, there is a chronological and causal
relation between the two: 'Clinical observations leave no doubt that
[[denial is a]{.underline}]{.mark} more archaic, [[more
**primitive**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and historically earlier [[mechanism
than repression]{.mark} -- in fact, its **forerunner**'. Denial will
'normally prepare and assist repression', which [supersedes the former
in the struggle against reality and lends it **finer
precision**]{.mark}]{.underline}.62 It is because denial has ruptured
the relation between ego and reality that repression comes into play, as
a successor, a more diligent executioner of the task bequeathed.

While these distinctions have not made it into the psychoanalytical
canon, the basics of repression are not in much dispute.63 Here we might
return to the founding father. 'The essence of repression lies simply in
turning something away, and keeping it at a distance, from the
conscious', writes Freud, immediately pointing to the overlap with
denial.64 [[Repression is all about keeping something unpleasant
**tucked away**]{.mark}, out of sight, under the lid]{.underline}. It
entails that the subject simultaneously will know about this thing and
not know about it. She does not want to know and so pushes the material
down into the unconscious, in yet another version of flight from
reality: there is some trauma, some painful stimuli that cannot be borne
out in the open.65 We can then move on and hazard the proposition that
[[geoengineering would represent a **materialised** and
**institutionalised** repression of the climate
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}.

It all begins with a moment of danger. 'The Ego guards against this
danger by repression.'66 Called forth by a drive internal to the ego, a
real external menace is breathing down its neck. There has arisen a
clash between reality and drive that is dangerous to the ego, which
reacts by 'freeing itself from the contradiction' through an act of
flying away: repression, Freud stresses again and again, is 'an attempt
at flight'.67 (The English words fusing the aerial and the elusive, one
is here tempted to see the aviation technology of geoengineering
literally fulfilling the scenario.) In his characteristic blend of
psychology and thermodynamics, he conceives of the drive as a quantum of
psychic energy pushing against the surrounding world; and when the
energy reaches 'a certain level of intensity', the conflict 'becomes
active, and precisely this activation elicits repression.'68 We
recognise here the emergency and the decision to deploy. This is the
moment when the flames from the child have leapt onto the clothes of the
father; or, when the wildfire has entered the lawn and the grass itself
starts burning. Now something else has to be done. To endure, denial
must make the leap into repression.

But the energy repressed does not thereby go out of existence. Rather it
stays active down below, bubbling, simmering, exerting pressure on the
forces above, seeking to break through the lid and discharge itself.
Repression cannot be like a volcano that erupts in one moment and goes
quiet the next. 'We should not think of the process of repression as a
single event with permanent results, as when, say, a living thing is
killed and from then on remains dead; repression demands, rather, a
constant expenditure of energy and would be undermined if this were
relaxed'. [Maintaining the equilibrium requires an equally
'**unrelenting counterpressure**' in an 'unending conflict': the
injections must not cease; [repression is a long-term
commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}.69

Meanwhile, in this overheated cauldron, the energy -- indestructible by
definition -- must find other outlets. They can appear far removed from
the original source. The negated energy succeeds in getting its way 'by
certain roundabout paths', but not without 'submitting to some
distortions'.70 Here come the side effects: the fractured regional
climates, the lacking rainfall, the diffuse sunlight, the white sky, the
blistering sunsets and all the far-fetched rest. The repressed material
'proliferates in the dark, so to speak, and finds extreme forms of
expression', remote derivatives that can take the subject and those
around her by surprise.71 They too must be dammed up, through new rounds
of repression (feedback, cocktail geoengineering).72 But in the end, all
of this, of course, is in vain. 'A ceaseless struggle is being waged
against the repressed, in which the repressing forces steadily lose
ground' (the law of the tendency of side effects to rise).73 Ultimately
the defences fail. The more heavily the dam is reinforced, the greater
the pressure, until there is the inevitable 'return of the repressed':
and of this, science knows no better picture than the termination
shock.74 'The "return of the repressed" takes place at the fearful
turning points of history', notes Herbert Marcuse.75 The research has
described in some detail what it would look like.

[This correspondence between the [structure of **geoengineering** and
that of **repression** seems nearly uncanny]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it
is not, needless to say, perfect. In Freud, the secondary output from
the repressed material chiefly consists in fantasies, not exactly
analogous to side effects in the climate system.76 On the other hand,
[geoengineering almost realises other elements of his
model]{.underline}. He famously compartmentalises the mind and likens it
to a building with two rooms, a large entrance hall and a drawing-room,
with a threshold in between. Facing the entrance hall into which
impulses stream, positioned on the threshold, 'a watchman performs his
function: he examines the different mental impulses, acts as a censor,
and will not admit them into the drawing-room if they displease him.'77
This metaphor has given rise to heated dispute between psychoanalysts
and them and their critics, as it seems to imply that the mind is
inhabited by an extra agent. The 'watchman' or 'censor' appears to be a
subject in his own right, a homunculus inside the human, who can monitor
prospective infiltrating forces, evaluate them and block the door if he
judges it for the best. In a coherent theory of the mind, this kind of
presence and activity are difficult to integrate.78 In our case,
however, it is exactly how things are supposed to work: the geoengineer
would be the Instanz endowed with intelligence, its extended arms
stationed on the threshold to select among the radiation seeking
entrance. Something similar goes for another problem in the Freudian
theory, namely that of initial knowledge. [[Repression appears to
require a '**traumatic moment**]{.mark}', in which the mind knows
perfectly well the danger it will pretend does not exist]{.underline}.
Lucidity must supervene on at least one occasion for the flight to get
underway.79 [And, again, [this is precisely how geoengineering would
present itself]{.mark}. To these two outstanding problems in the theory
of repression, an **empirical solution** has now been
drafted]{.underline}.

[[Geoengineering does not address the **causes** of global warming: it
represses it]{.mark}, **exclusively** and **literally**. [It maps nearly
perfectly onto the **Freudian model** of
repression]{.mark}]{.underline}. The point, however, is not merely the
formal resemblance or isomorphism between geoengineering and Freudian
repression; rather, [the former should be seen as a substantive instance
of the latter, by dint of its functional relation to
denial]{.underline}. Capitalist society will have moved all the way into
the emergency on the psychic fuel of denial, which, beyond that point,
must enter into the engines of the sulphate planes. The sole way for it
to persist henceforth is to flip into repression: [[geoengineering is
the **single** available measure by which this society can convince
itself that the fire is not happening]{.underline}]{.mark}, even after
it has become unignorable. There is no other practical proposition for
the long-term survival of denial. [And [denial resists its own
end]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Or, following Jacobson's temporal schema, we can say that if
geoengineering follows next, it will happen only because the prior phase
has laid down the tracks for it. So strong as to drive society into the
emergency, denial will also determine the technology for treating its
symptoms (unlike a technology for attacking the root causes). Denial is
the 'forerunner', preparing and assisting and initiating the higher
phase of repression.80 Precisely because it is this fuel that has taken
society so deep into the conflagration, we should expect its energies to
flow over into the emergency response and upgrade themselves into an
unrelenting effort to keep the heating at a distance. [If we accept that
denial is constitutive of the **climate crisis**, we should expect it to
infuse geoengineering, which would be merely a **continuation**, a
transmutation of the processes that have brought the **catastrophe**
about]{.underline}. If the emergency is an eye of a needle for denial,
it -- and the rich man -- can enter only by actually suppressing climate
change, through technologies that constitute means of repression.81

The genius of David Keith might lie in his personal prefiguration of
this upgrading. He is on record as making the following statement, in a
book published in 2010:

I'm not sure that global warming is such a threat to human civilization.
I think we have to be honest with ourselves -- there will be winners and
losers. Some places will experience more productivity. Some people will
enjoy warmer weather. This is not to deny or minimize the suffering and
hardship that others will experience, especially in poor countries. But
the fact is, human beings are a remarkably adaptive species. And I
believe that, by and large, people will adapt to the changing climate.
If it's just the human race you're worried about, I'm not sure global
warming is such a big problem.82

Along with the blatant racism and classism on display here -- the
distinction between the fate of non-white others in poor countries and
that of the human race -- one could hardly find a more perfect example
of interpretive denial. The same book has Keith talking down solar and
wind power.83 Today, however, he would be careful to avoid any such
vulgar errors and instead consistently refers to the urgency of saving
human civilisation -- poor people in particular -- from global heating,
by means of solar and wind, yes, but first of all some rational
geoengineering. He has made the volte-face for which he and his cohort
are grooming others.84 If, or when, it happens en masse, it might well
sweep up the most obdurate far-right denialists too; this has not
transpired yet, precisely because the moment of emergency, as we have
defined it here, still lies in the future. [Denialism will remain a
**viable project** for some time more.85 So will the 'bubble-like
psychic retreat from reality' in which [**dominant classes** are
engaged]{.mark}]{.underline} -- until reality pierces the bubble, and
the retreat must continue in another form. After that traumatic moment,
[[geoengineering alone would allow these classes to protect their
**fossilised privilege**]{.underline}]{.mark} (finishing another round,
as it were).86

[[If repression sublates denial]{.mark} and takes it to a higher, more
refined stage, [it also blends with **symptom
formation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, these two can be all but
indistinguishable. Jamieson Webster points out that repression needs the
symptom, in which psychic contradictions are converted into corporeal
acts. She brings out the materialist character of the Freudian theory:
the ego removes itself from danger by inventing a somatic symptom, as in
a lady compulsively washing her hands. [Likewise, geoengineering would
activate a symptom through the mobilisation of substances around the
body of the planet]{.underline}. It is through these conversions into
physical symptoms that the ego runs away from the conflict, and in the
process, she becomes dependent on them -- obsessively so. Fidelity to
the symptom is her persistent flight. 'The force of repression creates a
new relationship to the way the hysteric relates to knowledge, namely,
that she does not know, and this not-knowing -- far from being a problem
-- becomes her virtue.'87 Or, in Freud's own words, apparently inspired
by Macbeth, symptom formation is about 'undoing what has been done'.88
Through such undoing, the subject can divest herself of knowledge of the
real events. This, of course, is precisely the script Lady Macbeth tries
to follow, but the brilliance of her creator lies in the repeated
disclosures of its futility.

Macbeth himself is the first to doubt that the washing really will have
the desired effect. 'Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood /
Clean from my hand? No -- this my hand will rather / The multitudinous
seas incarnadine, / Making the green one red.' The repression exercised
through the symptom will merely spread the blood to all corners of the
system. But his wife insists, and drifts ever further from reality: 'You
see her eyes are open', says a doctor; 'Ay but their sense is shut',
answers a gentlewoman. She suffers the blindness of the seeing eye, but
eventually gives up too, when forced to realise that no amount of
washing will in fact remove the deed: 'Here's the smell of the blood
still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. O,
O, O!', and more acutely: 'What's done, cannot be undone.'89 All that
then remains is the couple's bloody downfall.

Geoengineering is about undoing what has been done -- the recipe, in
Macbeth, for going off the rails. A Freudo-Marxist theory would not only
give a more realistic picture of what this enterprise would mean and
what psychic energies it would run on than roseate premisses of
rationality. It would also imply that a geoengineered world would be
less governed by rationality than one that simply warms up. Repression
marks one step not closer to reality, but away from it. Otto Fenichel --
spiritual leader of the second generation, close comrade of Jacobson --
intimated as much: 'Anyone who must keep repressed material in a state
of repression has to act inappropriately and is handicapped in his
judgement and his sense of reality.'90 If that sounds like an abstract
theorem, we can fill it only with speculative concretion.

2.2 Under the Blood-Red Sunsets

What would actual living people feel and think in a geoengineered world?
It is impossible to know in advance, of course, but this factor warrants
speculation as much as any other. One thing we know for a certainty:
fossil capital will not die a natural death, not go into the night
without defending itself, either before or after the onset of
geoengineering. The miracle would require a massive thrust from below.
Whether as the Children of Kali or some other incarnation of popular
agency, there would have to be a force pulling off disruption on a scale
never yet seen, inflicting material costs on fossil capital so injurious
that it -- presumably under the guidance of some states -- would have to
be conclusively liquidated. The question then becomes: would a
geoengineered world be conducive to the formation of such subjectivity?
Or would it be detrimental to it, thereby reducing not only the first
incentive for mitigation worthy of the name (climate impacts) but the
second (climate revolt) too?

[If [geoengineering works reasonably well, it will keep the reality of
global heating away from the conscious]{.mark}, at a distance. But
because this [**veil of repression** would be wrapped around the entire
planet]{.mark}, it would be visible to the naked eye]{.underline}.
Sunsets would be reminders. Merely by turning the gaze skyward, at least
outside conurbations, one would acquire proof of the procedure. How
might people react to such atmospheric enclosure? One eminent scholar of
geoengineering, Alan Robock, had the sagacity to raise that question in
his classic catalogue of 20 side effects: '[Both the **disappearance**
of blue skies and the appearance of red sunsets could have [strong
**psychological impacts** on humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}.'91 It is not
a theme that has been further explored. Psychological approaches are
conspicuous by their absence in research on geoengineering, and the
rationalist-optimists have no idea how to treat parameters of this
stripe, except by bracketing them out; in his attempt to allay concerns
about all of the 20 side effects, Wagner skips over this particular
warning from Robock and leaves it 'as an open question'.92 No
rationalist-optimist could ponder it for long and stay true to his
axioms.

But since a counterforce to take the place of the reduced first
incentive -- and hence any post-deployment future for mitigation --
hinges on popular reactions and actions, the question should at least be
elaborated. One possibility is awakening. One could imagine outpourings
of revulsion and fury at this ultimate act of dispossession: not even
the sky and the stars available for common appreciation any more. People
might rise up against the tyrannical classes that first stabbed the
climate so insistently that it collapsed and then sought to cover up the
deed by this disgusting pollution. They might be provoked to mobilise
all available force behind demands for expropriation of fossil fuel
property and restoration of a liveable climate. Perhaps they might even
win.

Or, things could go the other way around: [geoengineering could hone the
skill of **blindness** in the seeing eye]{.underline}. Flagrant
manifestations of wrongness are evidently not a sufficient condition for
indignant protest. If people have opted for an 'ostrich-like policy'
(Freud) towards climate impacts raining down all around them, surely
they would be capable of habituating themselves to an engineered
atmosphere and accept it as one more token of contemporary life.93 (By
the same token, the visibility of geoengineering-as-repression would not
reduce its effectiveness as such -- just as denial can be entirely
open-eyed.) Catriona McKinnon has speculated that the generation growing
up in the decades spanning intense research, launch and early deployment
might decry the losses, but maybe not so their children. Acclimatisation
could ensue. Several decades into geoengineering, 'perhaps only
nostalgic "old fools" with "lighted rooms" inside their heads would
mourn for lost blue skies and starry nights.'94 Resignation should be
expected to deepen over time.

But [[a scenario where geoengineering has no psychic effects on those
below is **improbable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Robock is onto something:
merely the altered make-up of the sky (leaving other effects aside for
the moment) may well induce inner turmoil. Anxiety could follow. Robock
nods toward 'The Scream' by Edward Munch, the visual locus classicus for
-- not to say clichéd image of -- that particular emotion, the vibrating
blood-red sunset enhancing the anguish of the wailing figure: a
composition possibly inspired by the effects of the eruption of the
Krakatoa volcano in 1883 (the blast of sulphate from which cut average
temperatures on Earth by 1.2 degrees for a year).95 Of what does the
feeling speak? 'Angst', Adorno lays down, 'is the claustrophobia of a
systematized society', a gut response to 'the closed system'.96
[Geoengineering might [take **closure** and **claustrophobia** to new
heights]{.mark}. Capitalist society is like a 'brick wall', into which
people bang their heads: and it expands, 'leaving less and less
outside]{.underline}'.97 The diagnosis fits: the wall enwrapping the sky
itself, there to intensify the experience of powerlessness. It is
through technology introduced from above that society integrates its
populations ever more tightly and confines them in inferiority. 'The
individual is wholly devalued in relation to the economic powers, which
at the same time press the control of society over nature to hitherto
unsuspected heights.'98 Is geoengineering likely to herald empowerment?
A season of confidence in the self-activity of the masses? Nothing less
would be prerequisite to mitigation.

But white sky and red sunsets would be an index of epochal failure: the
utter inadequacy of the forces taking on fossil capital; the stupefying
power of this enemy, certified through a seal in heaven. The reminders
would be of repression (perhaps in the dual sense) and defeat. An
individual, a subaltern class might feel diminished to the point of
nullity under this vault of stratospheric brick -- psychologically, a
strong deterrence to activism. In this scenario, [a geoengineered world
is 'one that secretly everyone finds deeply **dubious**, but it is also
one that is [so **overpowering** that people feel they can do nothing
about it]{.mark}'; one where the 'incredible **disproportion** between
all individuals]{.underline}, every individual, wherever they might be,
and the concentrated power of society' [has increased even further, so
that 'the notion of [resisting this **agglomerated power** seems
illusory]{.mark}]{.underline}.'99 This would indeed be something like
The Scream.

Effects of such nature could have their own temporal arc. The sigh of
relief when the emergency is palliated might usher in positive
acquiescence, as the first popular science book on the topic intuited:
'The illusion of control -- "[Everything's okay, the scientists have
fixed the problem" -- could engender **apathy** at a time when we
desperately need to stop pouring carbon dioxide into the
sky]{.underline}.'100 Deeper into the operation, the risk of termination
shock might generate late submission. Who would dare to rise up against
the powers in the sky, if their coming down to Earth would spell doom?
People would be forced 'to turn the realities that have been foisted on
them into their own business simply in order to survive.'101 Needless to
say, there would also be plenty of potential for bourgeois coldness
towards victims of side effects. If things go this way, [the repression
above would be **internalised** below, shading back into the original
denial]{.underline}; and to the same degree, the return of the repressed
would become more inevitable, more frightful.

On the other hand, again, there is a [distinct potential for
**politicisation** of the weather]{.underline}. For the first time in
history, some human giant would have his hands on clouds and rains,
atmospheric rivers and air currents. Extreme weather events could no
longer be dismissed as flukes, accepted as acts of God or, indeed,
deplored as outcomes of global heating. A suspicion might take hold that
they stem from the deliberate manipulation -- this parching of our
fields is your fault!102 Because weather would be subjected to
intentions -- the defining attribute of human agency -- it would also
enter the realm of political contestation; but as we have seen,
satisfactory attribution would require painstaking scientific work. One
scholar aligned with the rationalist-optimist position has thus
identified a potential for mayhem: if bad weather happens under
stratospheric aerosol injection, 'the response is likely to be angry and
irrational'.103 [One can imagine people traumatised by suffering in the
emergency carrying their rage into the geoengineered world and lashing
out against presumed offenders. All sorts of dominant **class
interests** could gain from **scapegoating**]{.underline} -- say, an
Indian government deflecting blame for an agricultural crisis onto the
Chinese state spearheading injections.104 The crux of the matter is that
an entire sphere of tellurian existence -- weather -- would be
incorporated into the struggle between nations, classes, left and far
right and scores of other contenders: and the result might be, rather
than anxious lethargy, an immense volatility.

#### Turns case\-\--Marine cloud brightening in technocratic governance means we will never address the climate 

**Scott \'18** (Dane -- Professor of Ethics @ University of Montana,
\"Philosophy of technology and geoengineering\", 2018, Geoengineering
our Climate?, DOI: 10.4324/9780203485262-3//phs-maubu)

[The [failure of politics is]{.mark} most often cited for [justifying
geoengineering research]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, to a significant
degree, [the [lack of engagement]{.mark} by citizens in democratic
societies [contributes to]{.mark} the [lack of political
success]{.mark}.]{.underline} The inability of politics to deal with an
issue is a classic justification for a technological fix. This
justification may be convincing; dangerous climate change seems
imminent. At present, politics do not seem up to the task of acting in
time to avoid very serious consequences for the Earth's poor and the
tremendous loss of the Earth's biodiversity. However, [[no]{.mark}
geoengineering [proposal can]{.mark} ultimately [save us from]{.mark}
this political [failure]{.mark}]{.underline}: [at best geoengineering
proposals are technological fixes capable of buying time until effective
action can be taken]{.underline}. Moving economies away from fossil
fuels while allowing developing economies to grow will involve hard
social and political work. If we were to research geoengineering, it
would be wise to put our effort towards technologies that do not worsen
the problem of disengagement. To repeat the question: all things being
equal, which of these two technologies, [**[marine cloud
brightening]{.mark}**]{.underline} or the brightening of urban surfaces,
would increase people's engagement with the issue?

On the one hand, the unmanned ships that would implement marine cloud
brightening would do their work far from people's consciousness. The
fleets of cloud brightening machines would be invisible to all but a few
technicians. While implementation would be controversial and generate
discussion for a time, once implemented it would require no engagement
by a great majority of people. Moreover, [marine cloud brightening would
be far from politically neutral.]{.underline} Arguably, [it would [lend
itself to centralised, technocratic governance]{.mark}. It is likely
that initiating [this technology would create]{.mark} [a political
fight]{.mark} that could have the positive result of engaging more
people in the climate issues]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, [once
implemented]{.mark}, for all intents and purposes, the [public could
ignore it]{.mark} unless things went wrong.]{.underline} On the other
hand, the brightening of urban surfaces could lend itself to more
consistent immediate engagement by people. The activity of lightening
roofs and roads would require a high degree of public engagement at the
personal and local levels. On a personal level, one could imagine some
people willingly buying more reflective roofing material while others
complain bitterly. Either way, people would be directly engaged in the
issue. On a civic level, one could imagine a contentious city council
meeting as citizens debated brightening public surfaces. These changes
would be no doubt highly contentious, generating numerous discussions
between citizens on the climate issue. Moreover, brightened surfaces
would serve as a more immediate reminder of the climate issue than
marine cloud brightening could. Many questions could be raised from this
terse illustration. However, [it is clear that [marine cloud brightening
would]{.mark} more closely [follow **the device
paradigm**]{.mark}]{.underline} than would the brightening of urban
surfaces.

In sum, when viewed from the device paradigm, [[research into proposals
that]{.mark} strongly [reinforce this paradigm **should be
avoided**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [[they would]{.mark} likely [make it
harder to create]{.mark} the necessary [moral resolve that will]{.mark}
ultimately [be required to power the political will to address the
climate]{.mark} problem]{.underline}. Those that do more to increase
engagement and understanding of the issue would be better choices for
research. Furthermore, [[proposals that]{.mark} naturally [favour
**technocratic**,]{.mark} [centralised **governance** should be
avoided]{.mark},]{.underline} while those that favour more democratic,
decentralised governance would be better choices for investigation. One
could easily imagine taking the simple illustration above as a model for
discussing other geoengineering proposals. In particular, it would be
interesting to contrast various proposals that remove carbon from the
atmosphere with those that attempt to block or reflect solar radiation.

Ironically, as Pickering would have it, one could argue that [[the
history of industrialization]{.underline}]{.mark} already has ridden
"the flows of becoming" as "the detached dualism between men and nature"
has been first thrown askew and then next [[knit again]{.mark} together
[as]{.mark} [rising]{.mark} levels of greenhouse [gases **spew**]{.mark}
forth [from humans]{.mark}, animals, plants, [and
machines]{.mark}]{.underline} without "any Mondrianesque superstructure"
(Pickering and Guzik, 2008: 10). Hence, is [[humanity]{.mark}
in]{.underline} some sense [already]{.underline} "being de Kooning" [in
a [decentered]{.mark}, diffuse, and dispersed [manner that
accelerates]{.mark} global [warming in **one dance of
agency**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now, and with perhaps more irony,
however, this anarchic effort to dominate Nature through
[[burning]{.mark} fossil [fuel]{.mark}s]{.underline} behind decentered
ontologies [for becoming richer with more carbon-intensive energy
systems is now prompting fresh [calls for]{.mark} more rational
planning, [**technological innovation, and big science** to be used in a
**dominating**]{.mark}, detached, and disciplining [mobilization of
geoengineers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Until now, these efforts probably
have mistaken, as Heidegger puts it, "the correct for the true"
(Pickering and Guzik, 2008: 9), but these trends are deeply embedded in
social practices. One can wonder about Pickering‟s slightly contorted
rhetorical offerings. At times, they might not seem to be worth the
effort, but he still does have a point.

The [dilemmas here are many]{.underline}. Neither Mondrian nor de
Kooning has been truly hegemonic as allegorical markers of
technics-in-action, but devotees in the technosciences of both of them
have united various counter-hegemonic alliances intent upon producing
ecological disaster. Even though today‟s complex petroleum-powered
technologies are all co-producing their powers and plans together, they
show that the [tactics we have for "being in the world"]{.underline} as
greenhouse gassers mostly [are failing]{.underline}. Certainly, at
times, "it can indeed be better to go with the flow" (Pickering and
Guzik, 2008: 11), but the past six or seven decades of energy use call
this position into question. Even so, [the [history]{.mark} of fossil
fuel combustion]{.underline}, which is being done with more and more
Mondrianesque detachment and domination, also apparently [[is a failed
one]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now, at times, it might indeed be worse to
impose on the Earth‟s unstable atmosphere with its [rising levels of
greenhouse gases]{.underline} "a dualist Mondrian-style impulse" [for
[geoengineering some]{.mark} grand "detached and timeless human
[conception of **how it should be**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Pickering and
Guzik, 2008: 6).

Abstract expressionism in both its nomadic vernaculars and royal
formalisms perhaps is spinning up too many double binds when the dance
of agency needs to find quickly other answers in the mangle of
practices. Pickering urges us to break "the spell of Mondrian" and
embrace "a politics of experiment" (Pickering and Guzik, 2008: 13), but
industrial civilization actually has been in such a mode for nearly
three centuries as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to
accumulate at dangerously high levels with many adverse ecological
effects. More problematically, [to correct this situation]{.underline},
would-be expert [[geoengineers invite us]{.mark} to return to recast the
spell]{.underline} of Mondrian **[[in a bid to control the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which is]{.underline} might
[not]{.underline}, in fact, be [easily controllable due to]{.underline}
its [intrinsically complex qualities]{.underline}.

**Geoengineering fails --- by treating the Earth as a system to be
optimized, it finalizing the shift from world-as-context to
world-as-picture making future ecological violence inevitable.**

**Zlotky \'19** (Reid -- BA in Philosophy @ Princeton University,
\"Heidegger and Geoengineering: Technology and Being in the
Anthropocene\", 2019, Princeton University, phs-maubu)

First, it is important at this point to address the essence of
technology. [[Heidegger defines]{.mark} technology]{.underline}, as
opposed to its common understanding, not as simply the utilization of
something as a means to a certain end, but [[technology as itself a
human activity]{.underline}]{.mark} (Heidegger 1). For example,
Heidegger notes that we use tools to build technology like airplanes,
but that flying in an airplane in its essence is technology or
technological insofar as flying is an activity for some teleological
purpose, such as to arrive at some destination (Heidegger 2). With that
in mind, it is clear that the totality of the metaphysics of the
Anthropocene is characterized by the technological condition. [The
defining feature of the epoch is that of [humans]{.mark} using their
energy as well as [harvest]{.mark}ing [energy from the earth]{.mark}
with the intention of [supplanting the natural order]{.mark} of things
[through the domination of time and space]{.mark} that defines the high
quality of living of our era.]{.underline} For example, commercial
flight made it possible to traverse the Atlantic Ocean in no more than a
couple of hours. I can become aware of what happened halfway across the
globe instantaneously, and I can have almost any object that I desire
show up on my doorstep in about one day. Clearly, this change in
societal technological use had immense changes in culture and ideas of
what it means to be human in addition to material prowess.

However, as [[humans utilize]{.mark} this gift of [technological]{.mark}
capacity [to conscientize their understanding of human stewardship over
the earth]{.mark}]{.underline}, as seen through the photographing of The
Blue Marble, humankind has now understood the essence of the earth as a
closed system with themselves as a part of as well as separate from it.
Heidegger calls this the creation of the "world-as-picture" as opposed
to the "world-asmeaning" or the "world-as-context" (Hamilton 10).
[Heidegger means by this that [there is a change in]{.mark} the [essence
of nature when it becomes an object that can be]{.mark} completely
[represented and imagined within our minds]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
opposed to an idea that be only understood in fragmented parts or
imaginations. In addition to the [new profound revelation of
[humankind's earthly omniscience]{.mark}, humankind, in recognition of
its unity, also [assumes a position of omnipotence in the
earth]{.mark},]{.underline} where the growing environmental
consciousness movement understands that every mundane act that any
person does from water use to method of trash disposal can affect the
ecosystem halfway around the planet (Clark 30). [[Humans]{.mark} thus
[become more like **Gods** than like any other creature on the
earth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[To]{.mark} finally [complete]{.mark} the trinity of [Godlike
qualities]{.mark} with omniscience and omnipresence]{.underline},
[[**geoengineering** presents itself as]{.mark} a strategy
representative of [human omnipotence]{.mark}: [that humanity has the
power to control the earth]{.mark} in accordance with its will after
human affairs have been so efficiently orchestrated.]{.underline}
[[Geoengineering is the]{.mark} natural [continuation of humankind's
destiny of dominion]{.mark} over the earth via the fulfillment of this
trinity]{.underline}. So, Dasein will also change to reflect this
alteration in human capacity to order the world. In geoengineering,
[[humanity now has the power to alter the]{.mark} physical constitution
of the entire [earth and control]{.mark} the means by which [it]{.mark}
happens]{.underline}. This general idea is reflected in the Heideggerian
concept of Enframing, [whereby [the earth itself]{.mark} now
[exists]{.mark} as an agglomeration of resources [for **human disposal
and exploitation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hamilton 10). This new
understanding of the earth as exploitable represents a change in
metaphysics as well as a way of viewing the world given the new reality
of resource exploitation.

**Geoengineering forces us to perceive nature as a tool to be optimized,
not a phenomenon to be experienced---this locks in dominating
relationships to nature which blocks us from connecting to nature**

**Zlotky \'19** (Reid -- BA in Philosophy @ Princeton University,
\"Heidegger and Geoengineering: Technology and Being in the
Anthropocene\", 2019, Princeton University, phs-maubu)

[Humans, through [geoengineering]{.mark}, [transform]{.mark} the human
experience of [nature]{.mark}]{.underline} as something that can only
exist [[as]{.mark} Bestand, or "[standing reserve]{.mark}," as
[the]{.mark} entire natural **[world via the climate becomes a certain
means to an end]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as [the [nature is only
valuable]{.mark} or useful [to humanity if it exists within certain
parameters]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Standing reserve [manifests when we
value nature only]{.mark} insofar [as it has a certain temperature
range]{.mark}, contains a certain [level of precipitation or cloud
condensatio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n,]{.mark} and so forth. As nature
exists as standing reserve, [[humans lose]{.mark} the ability to create
an [authentic relationship with nature]{.mark} [or find meaning in
nature's existence]{.mark} other than as a means for something other
than itself]{.underline}, occupying the metaphysical idea of Zuhanden,
or "readiness-to-hand." This possibility of [[finding meaning]{.mark} in
nature [is]{.mark} also [foreclosed when the earth becomes something
calculatable, modellable, finite]{.mark}]{.underline}, and thus
representable in the sense that there is no longer the ability to
self-interpret what lies before oneself in nature and find significance
in that. The answer to why the modern metaphysics represented by
[[geoengineering]{.mark} necessarily [limit authentic connections with
nature]{.mark} is that there are a limited number of ways for people to
conceptualize their relationship with the world and its
objects]{.underline}, and one [[choosing]{.mark} to take [a modern
approach **trades off** with]{.mark} one's ability to **[authentically
connect with nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, a film editor
may understand a film as a series of clips that must be mechanically put
together, which it is, which means a film editor may find it much more
difficult to simply watch a movie and enjoy it for its amusing content
and convincing production qualities, although a movie editor is still
capable of enjoying movies. Thus, evidently, film students and the
average movie watching public understand movies in very different ways.
This analogy could also be applied to our era's understanding of the
environment. Even in modern metaphysics, it is clear that people can
relate to nature in pre-modern ways, but the ability to do so is
overdetermined by the strength of modern metaphysics in dictating
people's relationships with the world. The relationship the pre-modern
and modern conceptions of metaphysics have in relation to each other
might fruitfully be understood in Hegelian terms as the former as
thesis, latter as antithesis, and the synthesis forming with the modern
form as dominant. For example, [[the scientist who is]{.mark} concerned
with [modelling]{.mark} how [geoengineering]{.mark} will impact weather
patterns [will]{.mark}, more likely than not, [relate to nature]{.mark}
more [as a tool]{.mark} than authentically, [and that that will define
the relationship as opposed to a wondrous phenomenon]{.mark} with
unlimited aesthetic value]{.underline}. The argument is that modern
metaphysics in a vacuum supposes the non-existence of the authentic
possibilities of the pre-modern, and that [[the farther we
accelerate]{.mark} into this [technocratic]{.mark} modern [age]{.mark},
[the less]{.mark} likely [people will have]{.mark} the rational
[capacity to form authentic relationships with nature]{.mark} or
otherwise.]{.underline}

Over the last decade the claims made for the importance of literary
understanding, environmental humanities and imaginative reflection have
received a (perhaps tragic) reinforcement from the inverse relation
between the threats facing humans and other species, and the capacity
for action. It is almost as **[if [the prospect of calamity]{.mark} and
unprecedented change [is so intense that]{.mark} the practical, rational
and imaginative [resources we have for thinking]{.mark} about the future
[are]{.mark} simply and woefully [inadequate]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[If reason, [calculation,]{.mark} practice and day-to-day thinking
have [led to a tragic inability]{.mark} [to think beyond the]{.mark}
expediency of the [present]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} then perhaps
[it is the task of literature and the humanities to address our
sentimenta]{.underline}l, affective, habitual and non-cognitive
comportment towards the world. **[[Scientific knowledge]{.mark} and the
dissemination of facts, warnings and already-incurred losses have not
only made little impact on effective policy and lifestyle change; the
intensity and enormity of the problem may [have generated]{.mark} a
sense of practical impossibility. Here is where one might turn to the
problem of the sublime and deconstruction]{.underline}**. [Is it
possible to accept the [inhuman intensity of the problem]{.mark} of the
future]{.underline} -- **[[its necessary capacity to outstrip
calculation and imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- without abandoning
the task or problem of survival altogether? Rather than engineering
Nature, the humanities or the imagination in order to ensure 'our'
survival, one might ask whether there has been an excess of
comprehension in the face of a time and history that has not been
paralysing enough. [That is, in the face of the failure of scientific
know-how to have [significant impact on]{.mark} the [ways]{.mark} in
which '[we' manage]{.mark} [our future]{.mark}, perhaps it is not
literary know-how, expertise and cognitive expansion (and certainly not
the environmental humanities) that [we ought to embrace]{.mark} in order
[to sustain ourselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} What I would suggest,
perhaps counter-intuitively, is the importance of thinking in terms of a
deconstructive or material sublime. As Bruno Latour (2011) has noted,
there was a time when Nature performed the role of the inconceivably
infinite and therefore sublime force, against which the inconstancy of
human life and history seemed insignificant. Now, he argues, it is human
history that appears immutable -- as though capitalism and the logic of
the market were beyond our power -- while Nature is changing rapidly.
This reversal, he insists, needs to be reversed yet again in order that
what appears immutable and beyond our measure returns to the domain of
what can be made, and unmade; there is nothing natural, immutable or
sublime about capital. Perhaps, then, [we need to deconstruct
sublimity]{.underline}. In its Romantic mode (as Latour reminds us), one
could appeal to the infinite, immutable vastness of Nature's 'ample
power / To chasten and subdue' (to deploy Wordsworth's language (1985 :
37)). But, just as Latour led the way in the notion [that Nature does
not exist but is always composed, so Wordsworth also posited another
presence, 'a sense sublime / Of something far more deeply
interfused']{.underline} (Wordsworth 1936). [That is to say, [what is
sublime is]{.mark} [neither nature nor humanity but]{.mark} their
[impossible]{.mark} and unthinkable [imbrication]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[This what I would refer to as [the material]{.mark} or deconstructive
[sublime]{.mark}]{.underline}. Before there is a Nature that is
infinite, immutable, eternal and that offers 'us' either solace,
recompense or moral grandeur, there is inscription: the coming into
distinction of living beings, the orientation and inflections that
eventually constitute 'a' Nature and a humanity. One could not, then,
simply deploy literary culture to change the way we think, as if there
were a 'we' or mindset that could be refashioned or engineered; nor
would Nature, with the Anthropocene, finally make itself felt as bound
up with our history and therefore worthy of the rights and care we grant
to humans. What appears as Nature is, to deploy Latour's terminology, an
effect of composition. Who or what composes Nature, Gaia or life is an
effect of composition. **[[To confront]{.mark} composition, inscription
or [materiality is not]{.mark} [only to abandon the lure]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the 'we' of the [new managerialism of]{.mark} the
[environmental humanities and geoengineering, it is also]{.mark} an
[acceptance]{.mark} [that sustaining literature is not something]{.mark}
that [we can choose to do]{.mark} or not do.]{.underline}** What
sustains itself, what is sustained, is the effect of forces of
inscription that are also forces of destruction, erasure and occlusion.
[This may seem both abstract and irresponsible, but it is perhaps the
only form of material responsibility possible.]{.underline} If, today,
[there is a 'we' who confronts Nature with a sense of loss it is because
of an ongoing history of inscription, including all the technologies
that have enabled human social assemblage, technology and literature in
the narrow sense]{.underline}. Any 'we' who seeks to sustain itself does
so by way of inscription. Literary sustainability is not some luxurious
or privileged add-on that 'we' might choose to maintain, in addition to
technology: [everything that appears as a 'we', as 'techne,' as
engineering, as Nature, as past and as future is the outcome of
inscriptive processes that select and erase, generating what will
survive and be sustained]{.underline}.

[A key premise for this book is that it is not just despite but because
of its difficulties that a literary engagement with
**[sustainability]{.mark} can prove variously productive. Some of these
[difficulties revolve around]{.mark} its [adoption as a mainstream
response]{.mark}** to environmental concerns.]{.underline} While
sustainability might be variously historicised (see the first two essays
in this collection -- by Jayne Elisabeth Archer, Howard Thomas and
Richard Marggraf Turley, and by John Parham[), it is of course strongly
influenced in current parlance by its most prolific definition, as
derived from the Brundtland Report.]{.underline} This report places
emphasis on humanity's long-term survival through a notion of
'sustainable development', which it describes as development 'that meets
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs' (World Commission 1987: 43)[. Such
a]{.underline} definition, in across setting a concrete goal applicable
domains, has given rise [not just to sustainability's widespread
implementation but also to the extensive body of work that continues to
redefine sustainability today.]{.underline} Since ecocritics have often
been most interested in approaches that strive, in literary and
philosophical terms, to reach beyond a reductive human-centrism,
sustainability's emphasis on the human sphere has led to concerns that
it fails to consider the nonhuman world sufficiently, its agencies and
our kinship with it (Alaimo 2012; O'Grady 2003). Its instrumentalist
demeanour can bring it into conflict with the deeper green standing of
many ecocritics (Bergthaller 2010; O'Grady 2003[). A **[further
difficulty is]{.mark} that, [due]{.mark} in part [to sustainability ' s
slipperiness as a term, it is vulnerable to
co-option]{.mark}**]{.underline} ( Alaimo 2012 ; Bloomfield 2015 ;
LeMenager and Foote 2012 ; Nardizzi 2013 ; Squire and Jarvis 2015 ),
[[whereby]{.mark} it is [appropriated]{.mark} [to legitimise]{.mark}
[corporate]{.mark} or political [endeavour]{.mark}]{.underline} -- to
include, as Stephanie LeMenager and Stephanie Foote put it, that which
'got us into trouble in the first place' ( 2012 : 572; see also Nardizzi
2013 ). Such problems, as Lynn Keller observes, may come down to a
question of 'sustainability of what and for whom?' ( 2012 : 579).
Sustainability also raises a number of conceptual difficulties. One
worry is that it erroneously strives for some kind of stasis whereby the
ecological present or past is extended into the ecological future
(Bloomfield 2015 ; O'Grady 2003 ; Mentz 2012 ). [John P. O'Grady, for
example, sees an 'obvious [flaw in reasoning']{.mark} in sustainability
' s 'privileging of duration or permanence as a value', which '[runs
counter to']{.mark} the '[fundamental]{.mark} [principle']{.mark} [that
nature 'is in flux']{.mark}]{.underline} ( 2003 : 3, emphasis in
original). [Mandy Bloomfield similarly views sustainability as a
'comforting narrative' in need of 'unsettling', and points out that the
[sciences of ecology]{.mark} '[have generally moved]{.mark}
[away]{.mark} from equilibrium-seeking ecosystems [towards]{.mark}
[disequilibrium models']{.mark}]{.underline} ( 2015 : 4--5). On this
note, Gillen D'Arcy Wood emphasises the need for ecocritics to recognise
the 'emergent biocomplexity paradigm driving sustainability science' (
2012 : 8), observing that sustainability studies 'begins from the
principle that all systems, human and natural, are characterised by
complexity and nonlinear change' (6). [[Other conceptual difficulties
include]{.mark} its various [internal conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Adeline Johns-Putra, in this collection, remarks for example on the way
[sustainability appears as an exhortation to both preserve and
transform]{.underline}. That is, the project of safeguarding our own
future by sustaining planetary wellbeing [[is reliant upon]{.mark} our
[capacity]{.mark} and willingness [to enact effective]{.mark}
[change]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, as she remarks elsewhere, while 'our
construction of "sustainability" is driven by a notion of care' for the
nonhuman world, care is itself a variously contingent concept that lacks
'ontological scrutiny' ( 2013 : 125[). In engaging with futural notions
of our own and other species, sustainability infuses the present with
that which is yet to emerge, and the subject of the present with that
which necessarily exceeds it. **[Effects]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[this]{.mark} difficulty [include]{.mark} the [way objectives]{.mark}
such as sustaining species diversity [take on]{.mark} [a managerial
approach]{.mark} [to]{.mark} that [which managerialism also]{.mark}
[undermines; sustainability's]{.mark}** [vulnerability to
co-option]{.mark} is perhaps another outcome.]{.underline} Yet, as
essays in this collection also indicate, such conceptual challenges are
themselves some of the grounds upon which sustainability might be
explored from a literary and ecocritical perspective.

"The Framework of [Resources and Techno-Managerialism"
continues]{.underline} investigating the connection between
[[human]{.mark} [supremacy and the **ecological
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, focusing on how it [[manifests in]{.mark}
our [time]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With the]{.underline} modern [[turn
in]{.mark}to a]{.underline} secular and [[industrial period,
**domination** over nature]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[deepened]{.mark}
and biodiversity destruction is foreshadowing]{.underline} a mass
extinction. Today, [[human supremacy]{.mark} is [no longer grounded
in]{.mark}]{.underline} metaphysical narratives of [[God-sanctioned
access to the nonhuman]{.mark} realm]{.underline}. Instead, [the
historical legacy of **[anthropocentrism]{.mark}** is [entrenched
by]{.mark}]{.underline} means of two prominent [[framings of the
human-nature relation]{.mark}ship:]{.underline} the frameworks of
[[resources and]{.mark} [techno-managerialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
most [conventional [way to reference the nonhuman]{.mark} realm
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} through [[the]{.mark} [concept of (**natural)
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and its [sundry spinoffs (such as
[fisheries, livestock, and natural]{.mark} [capital),
which]{.mark}]{.underline} implicitly [[represent the world as
**human-owned**]{.underline}]{.mark} and set it up [as an instrumental
field]{.underline}. In parallel, the framework of [[techno-managerialism
approaches eco]{.mark}logical [problems]{.mark}]{.underline} (that ensue
from treating the world as resources) piecemeal, addressing them [[via
tech]{.mark}nological [innovations]{.mark} and fixes [and]{.mark} via
managerial **[interventions]{.mark}** and adjustments]{.underline}. The
chapter canvases concrete example of techno-managerialism from
[[desalination]{.mark} and [mega-dams to genetic]{.mark} [engineering
and geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. It argues that construing the
natural world as resources and addressing challenges in a
techno-managerial register evade questioning the supremacist worldview.

#### Attempts at managing climate change through further meddling in nature ensures that resources will always be controlled in the most "efficient" way to bolster markets and produce the most, especially within the academy \[rehighlight if want to make academy claim!\]

Resource Managerialism [Resource managerialism]{.underline} can be read
as a [geo‐power]{.underline}/eco‐knowledge [of modernizing
economies.]{.underline} While voices in favour of conservation can be
found in Europe early in the nineteenth century, the real [establishment
of this stance comes in the United States]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the Second Industrial Revolution from the 1880s
through the 1920s and the [closing of the western frontier]{.underline}
in the 1890s. Whether one looks at John Muir\'s preservationist
programmes or Gifford Pinchot\'s conservationist codes, [an awareness of
modern industry\'s power to deplete natural resources, and hence the
need for systems of conserving their exploitation, is well
established]{.underline} by the early 1900s. Over the past nine decades,
the fundamental premises of resource managerialism have not changed
significantly. At best, this code of eco‐knowledge only has become more
formalized in bureaucratic applications and legal interpretations.
Evolving from the managerial logic of the Second Industrial Revolution,
which empowered technical experts (engineers and scientists) on the shop
floor and professional managers (corporate executives and financial
officers) in the main office, [[resource managerialism **imposes
corporate**]{.mark} administrative **[frameworks upon nature]{.mark}**
in order [to supply the economy]{.mark} and provision society through
centralized state guidance]{.underline}. These frameworks assume that
the national economy, like the interacting capitalist firm and
household, must avoid both overproduction (excessive resource use
coupled with inadequate demand) and underproduction (inefficient
resource use coming with excessive demand) on the supply side as well as
overconsumption (excessive resource exploitation coming with excessive
demand) and underconsumption (inefficient resource exploitation coupled
with inadequate demand) on the demand side. Even [[to construct the
managerial problem]{.mark} in this fashion [is to reduce
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}---through the encirclement of space and
matter by national as well as global economies---[[to a system]{.mark}
of geo‐power systems [that can be dismantled]{.mark}, redesigned, [and
assembled anew]{.mark} on demand [to produce 'resources']{.mark}
efficiently [when and where needed in the]{.mark} modern
[marketplace]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a cybernetic system of biophysical
systems, [[nature]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} energies, [materials, and
sites are [redefined]{.mark}]{.underline} by the eco‐knowledges of
resource managerialism [[as manageable]{.mark} resources [for]{.mark}
human beings to realize [great]{.mark} material ['goods' for]{.mark}
sizeable numbers of [some people,]{.mark} even [though greater]{.mark}
material and immaterial '[bads']{.mark}]{.underline} also might be
[[inflicted upon]{.mark} even [larger numbers of other people, who do
not]{.mark}]{.underline} reside in or [[benefit
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the advanced [national [economies]{.mark}
that]{.underline} basically [monopolize]{.underline} the use of [world
resources]{.underline} at a p. 110 comparative handful of highly
developed regional and municipal sites. Echoing California‐Berkeley\'s
declaration that environmental studies boil down to mobilizing the
biological, physical, and social sciences to address the major social
and political effects of current and future anthropogenic environmental
problems, Yale\'s Dean Cohon tells would‐be environmental studies
students that their professional power/knowledge will be crucially
significant in the coming years: 'Your role in helping to protect and
manage the integrity and survival of natural systems and human health
globally could not be more important. Since so much is now in human
hands, people are needed, more than ever, who are focused, informed, and
dedicated to learning' (Yale School of Forestry 1996: 9). Such
environmental beliefs, as they are embraced by eco‐managerialists,
infrastructuralize the earth\'s ecologies. [[The earth
becomes]{.underline}]{.mark}, if only in terms of techno‐science\'s
operational assumptions, [[an immense terrestrial
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the human race\'s 'ecological
life‐support system,' it has 'with only occasional localized failures'
provided 'services upon which human society depends consistently and
without charge' (Cairns 1995: 3). As the environmentalized
infrastructure of techno‐scientific production, [the earth
generates]{.underline} 'ecosystem services,' or those [derivative
products and functions of natural systems that human societies perceive
as valuable]{.underline} (Westmen 1978: 960--4). This complex system of
systems is what must survive; human life will continue only if such
survival‐sustaining services continue. And, as Colorado State\'s,
Yale\'s, Berkeley\'s, or Duke\'s various graduate programmes all record,
these infrastructural outputs include: the generation of soils, the
regeneration of plant nutrients, capture of solar energy, conversion of
solar energy into biomass, accumulation/purification/distribution of
water, control of pests, provision of a genetic library, maintenance of
breathable air, control of micro‐ and macro‐climates, pollination of
plants, diversification of animal species, development of buffering
mechanisms in catastrophes, and aesthetic enrichment. Because it is the
terrestrial infrastructure of transnational enterprise, [[the
planet\']{.mark}s ecology [requires highly disciplined re‐engineering to
guide its sustainable use **in the most performative
fashion**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In turn, academic practices must
monitor, massage, and manage those systems which produce all of these
robust services. Just as the sustained use of any technology 'requires
that it be maintained, updated and changed periodically,' so too does
the 'sustainable use of the planet require that we not destroy our
ecological capital, such as old‐growth forests, streams and rivers (with
their associated biota), and other natural amenities' (Cairns 1995: 6).
This infrastructuralization of the environment can be illustrated in
Colorado State\'s Forest Science recruitment brochure, which casts its
knowledge as being dedicated to 'Valuing our Forests and Natural
Resources' both inside the classroom and outside in the mountains. To
imagine what forests are and do, the Department of Forest Science asks:
p. 111 Have you ever stopped to think how the health of our forests
affects your own life? Without forests, there would be no wood for homes
or fiber for countless paper products we use every day. Forests also
help maintain watersheds and keep our air free of harmful pollutants.
And, for centuries, forests have been a very special place where people
go to see and enjoy nature. Whether you live in a city or small town,
forests impact your life in many ways. (Department of Forest Science
1996: 2) [[Forests]{.underline}]{.mark} here
[[become]{.underline}]{.mark} open infrastructural networks, or
quasi‐subjective agencies whose health, growth, and location are
[quasi‐objective [structures needed]{.mark} by human beings [as building
materials]{.mark}, watershed maintenance mechanisms, air cleaners, [or
human enjoyment zones]{.mark}.]{.underline} The environmental
infrastructure of our forests 'need people who can understand and manage
them' but, as Colorado State claims, 'only with well‐educated
professionals can we ensure that our resources will be available for the
benefit of present and future generations' (Department of Forest Science
1996: 2). To rightly manage this vital green infrastructure, it provides
four concentrations of discursive understanding and applied practice
---forest biology, forest fire science, forest management, and forest
business---to prepare environmental professionals. Learning about
forests 'from actual experience, not just from textbooks', Forest
science pledges comprehensive training as forest biology focuses 'on the
biology of trees and the ecology of forest'; forest fire science
examines 'fire as a forest management tool' as students 'learn how
prescribed fire can be used to enhance wildlife habitat, prepare
seedbeds, control forest insects and disease, and reduce fuel hazards';
forest management concentrates on how state and commercial agencies
exploit 'forest productivity, economics, and conservation, along with
the latest in computer‐based management tools'; and, forest business
teaches business applications 'if you seek employment with a private
timber company, or you wish to develop your own forest business'
(Department of Forest Science 1996: 3--4). Colorado State\'s Forest
Science Programme promises to open doors to jobs that oversee the
techno‐scientific nexus of discipline/sovereignty/territoriality in
managing forest resources as students either are able 'to qualify as a
professional forester and work with traditional national and
international resource organizations' or nd avenues that 'pursue
employment in fields such as land use planning, youth agency
administration, natural resource communications, mining reclamation,
business, law enforcement, or conservation biology' (Department of
Forest Science 1996: 4). Forest science here produces the discursive
truths which environmental professionals need 'to manage forests for
maximum growth; to protect forests from fires and disease; and to
conserve forest, soil, and water resources,' because such mediations of
power do provide 'a truly unique and rewarding opportunity' (Department
of Forest Science 1996: 2) to exercise their professional-- technical
power/knowledge ecologically. Risk Managerialism As Beck (1992)
suggests, [[risk managerialism is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[an integral
part of]{.underline}]{.mark} the self‐critical production and
[[reproduction of]{.underline}]{.mark} globally thinking, but locally
acting, [[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Schools of
enviro]{.mark}nmental [studies]{.mark}]{.underline} train students to
conceptually contain, actuarially assess, and cautiously calculate the
many dimensions of ecological risk in their ecotoxicology, environmental
assessment, or eco‐remediation courses. Yet, the assumptions of such
modelling techniques constitute only a scientized first take for the
sweep of reflexivity. They do not, and indeed [[cannot, capture
the]{.underline}]{.mark} depth, scope, duration, or **[[intensity of the
damage they pretend to measure]{.underline}]{.mark}.** Colorado State\'s
Department of Fishery and Wildlife Biology, for example, casts itself as
an international leader in the areas of risk assessment and analysis.
Combining practical laboratory experiences and field studies, it
suggests that areas of growing emphasis are risk‐analysis centred
concerns, like integrated resource management, conservation biology, and
environmental risk analysis (Department of Fishery 1996: 3). This focus
upon quantitative surveillance and evaluation in risk analysis also can
be found in the other graduate programmes\' curricula. Yale\'s graduate
course, Ecological Resource Risk Assessment and Management, for example,
hints that related course work in statistics, ecotoxicology, and
environmental chemistry will help its students to understand the impact
of pollution, disease, and ecological management practices on the health
of ecosystems. However, 'assessment of risk of an adverse impact on an
ecological resource caused by one or more chemical, biological, or
physical stressors, and monitoring the status and trends of an
ecological resource are priority needs of contemporary environmental
management' (Yale School of Forestry 1996: 31). Likewise, Duke\'s highly
economistic reading of environmental studies stresses the benefits and
costs of policies relating to sustaining resource productivity and
maintaining environmental quality in its risk analyses. Its graduate
course, Survey of Environmental Health and Safety, directs the attention
of students toward 'environmental risks from the perspective of global
ecology, biology, chemistry, and radiation' such that 'the nature and
scope of environmental hazards' might be addressed by its understanding
of 'risk assessment and management strategies' (Duke Nicholas School
1996a: 101), [the [economics]{.mark} and ecologies [of
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[create]{.underline}]{.mark}
[tremendous [new opportunities for]{.mark}]{.underline} cadres of
[educated [professionals to work productively as better resource
managers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Risk management at
[[colleges]{.underline}]{.mark} of natural resources [[presumes its
calculations 'are based on a (spatially]{.underline}]{.mark},
temporally, and socially [[circumscribed) accident
definition']{.underline}]{.mark} or that its analyses truly do 'estimate
and legitimate the potential for catastrophe of modern large‐scale
technologies and industries' (U. Beck 1996: 32). Superfund site after
supertanker spill after superstack bubble, however, indicate that
**[[this degree of managerial knowledge is]{.mark} precisely [what risk
management sciences]{.mark} at schools of environmental studies [fail to
produce]{.mark}]{.underline}**, 'and so they are falsifications, and can
be criticized and reformed in accordance with their own claims to
rationality' (U. Beck 1996: 33). This trend towards developing a fully
self‐conscious risk managerialism grounded in economistic trade‐offs
also surfaces fully in the curriculum of the Yale School of Forestry and
Environmental Studies, whose recent strategic restructuring commits it
fully to risk assessment methods because these techniques are
'redefining forestry to encompass all of the social and political
factors which we know from experience to be fundamental to good forest
management' (Yale School of Forestry 1996: 2). These visions of
environmental science recapitulate the logics of capitalist technics as
they work in the world\'s states and markets. [Rather than the
environment surrounding humanity, [the]{.mark} friction‐free
[global]{.mark} [marketplace of **transnational capital** is
what]{.mark} now **[envelopes nature]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Out of its
metabolisms are produced ecotoxins, biohazards, hydrocontaminants,
aeroparticulates, and enviropoisons whose individual impacts generate
inexorable collective risks. These [policy problematics
unfold]{.underline} now [on the global scale, because fast capitalism
has colonized so many more sites on the planet as part and parcel of its
own unique regime for sustainable development]{.underline}. As Yale\'s
Dean Cohon asserts: The challenge we all face now, as you know, is not
limited to one resource in one nation, but extends to the protection of
the environment worldwide. The fabric of natural and human communities
is currently torn or tattered in many places. There is hardly a place on
earth where human activity does not influence the environment\'s current
condition or its prospects for the future. (Yale School of Forestry
1996: 2) [[Well‐trained]{.mark} environmental [professionals
must]{.mark} measure, monitor, or [manage these risks]{.mark},
[leaving]{.mark} the rational operations of [global fast
capitalism]{.mark} wholly [intact as 'risks won']{.mark} for their
owners and beneficiaries, [while risk analyses]{.mark}]{.underline}
performed by each environmental school\'s practitioners and programmes
[[deal with]{.mark} the **[victims of 'risks

#### The affs techno-fixes normalize ecological collapse which glorifies a supremacist logic that entrenches domination and ensures the biosphere remains colonized in the name of survival

Eileen **Crist**, 20**19**, \[PhD in Sociology, Emerita Associate

[The [prevalent response to ecocatastrophes]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, has not been to confront the worldview driving the blotting out
of innumerable beings in blitzkrieg campaigns or by a thousand cuts.19
Virtually no mainstream politician, media outlet, or organization has
contested the historical legacy of humanity's declaring itself supreme,
displacing nonhumans and wilderness, and reinventing Earth as
civilization's stage set. Rather, the typical response to ecological
problems is a riff on the anthropocentric narrative. Foremost focus
centers on how humanity's impact might affect the fate of humanity
itself. "Human driven changes to the environment," analysts worry, "are
raising concerns about the future of Earth's environment and its ability
to provide services required to maintain viable human civilizations."20
Such concerns are often followed up [with exhortations [about]{.mark}
the unique strengths of the human---our [intelligence, resourcefulness,
and innovat]{.mark}ive esprit--- through which we [might resolve
difficulties]{.mark} on our march]{.underline}.21

Implicitly confirming instead of challenging the human supremacist
worldview, the dominant framework for dealing with environmental fallout
[[is]{.mark} piecemeal and [techno- managerial]{.mark}]{.underline}.22
The piecemeal approach treats each problem in isolated fashion, instead
of viewing mounting problems collectively as symptoms of unrestrained
expansionism. The pragmatic pitch, or enthusiastic push, for techno-
managerial solutions [[rests on]{.mark} the received conviction of human
exceptionalism]{.underline}. Indeed, today's most common spin on the
Differential Imperative---the axiomatic status of human
distinction---[is perdurable [faith in]{.mark} the [**technological and
managerial prowess**]{.mark} of our species [to carry the human
enterprise onward]{.mark} and forward]{.underline}.

[Technoscientific reports and popular media [showcase]{.mark} a host of
[**ostensible** solutions to ecological conundrums]{.mark} framed in a
[compartmentalized]{.mark} and techno- managerial register]{.underline}.
For example, scientific and policy reports aver that shortages of
freshwater for agriculture, industry, or urban uses might be tackled via
desalination, or by other [[mega- engineering
projects]{.underline}]{.mark} like rerouting entire rivers. Diminishing
fossil- fuel reserves will be countered (and are being countered) by
deploying [high- impact [technologies that flush]{.mark} hard-to-access
[deposits from **deep-sea** and land sediments]{.mark}, mountaintops,
boreal forests, and other landscapes]{.underline}. Down the road,
researchers hope to repurpose algae, switchgrass, or other biomass into
fuel and perhaps food. Should climate disruption become ominous,
[humanity might rely on **[geoengineering]{.mark}**
wizardry]{.underline}---a newfangled "Star Wars Initiative"
[[against]{.mark} a [global- warming]{.mark} offensive some tipping
point or other might launch]{.underline}.23 Adequate [[food
production]{.mark} will be secured [by **efficient management** of
land]{.mark}, water, fertilizer, and pesticide inputs, as well as by
corporate rearrangements of crop and animal DNA]{.underline}, so the
former can grow on arid, degraded, or flooded lands and the latter made
to balloon into bigger "protein" portions. [As wild fish are depleted,
industrial aquaculture operations can be (and are being) escalated; and
since the ocean fish needed to feed farmed fi sh are running out, no
doubt someone is working on how to fatten confined fish on soymeal,
corn, or chicken]{.underline}.

[[In framing environmental challenges as]{.mark} piecemeal technical and
[**managerial challenges**, the big picture]{.mark} [within which
problems are]{.mark} swelling [disappears]{.mark} from the terrain of
questioning]{.underline}. Since [humanity's dominance]{.underline} is
not on the table for scrutiny, but on the contrary [remains the
foundation for moving forward, [the mainstream approach is to]{.mark}
frame problems within the established order and [apply single- fi le
inter ven tions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, "[[**innovation**"
is the buzzword of the day]{.mark}. Large- scale [research]{.mark}
efforts [and fi nancial investments are poured into]{.mark}
technological inventions, [techno- fi xes]{.mark}, and effi ciency
gains]{.underline}.

The techno- managerial paradigm is pervasive and its brainchildren are
copious and multifarious: ranging from plans to redirect rivers like the
Ganges and Brahmaputra in order to irrigate agro- industrial landscapes,
to parody- sounding techno- fixes such as "Robochop," a proposed remote-
operated fl eet of robots for mashing up jellyfi sh blooms (caused by
humanity's massive disruption of ocean life).24 To give a third example,
in August 2015, in the midst of a California drought, Los Angeles offi
cials had the city's water reservoir blanketed with ninety- six million
black, four- inch plastic "shade balls" to prevent evaporation. "This is
a blend of how engineering really meets common sense," one of the
decision makers opined. "We saved a lot of money, we did all the right
things."25 Diverting India's holy rivers, engineering jellyfi sh
exterminators, and covering city drinking water with plastic balls:
These are examples of [initiatives through which the mainstream's
techno- managerial approach endeavors to deal with the Pandora's box of
plagues that human expansionism has unleashed]{.underline}. [A planet
inundated with gigantic engineering works such as mega- dams,
desalination plants, and nuclear power facilities, but also gimmicky
techno- fi xes [and **Band- Aid solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline} that
sound like Onion editorials--- this is the new world order coming
online.

[[Techno- managerialism is]{.mark} itself the [legacy of]{.mark} the
secularly established "[empire of mankind]{.mark}"]{.underline} that the
early modern period launched. The contemporary technological and
managerial framework epitomizes this psychohistorical inheritance. Over
the course of time, [[the more the non human domain]{.mark} has come
[under man's disposal]{.mark}, the [more confi-dence]{.mark} have
[humans]{.mark} come to [feel in their power to]{.mark} calculate,
engineer, plan, [mold]{.mark}, [and solve]{.mark}]{.underline}. At a
microlevel, [confidence in the framework [manifests in the way]{.mark}
sundry **[problem]{.mark} set[s]{.mark} [and challenges are taken
up]{.mark}**, serially and diligently]{.underline}. At a macrolevel, the
techno- managerial framework's confidence manifests in the aura of
haughty invincibility that envelops it---undaunted, as it apparently
remains, before the dire specters of rising seas, scorching heat waves,
shrinking fossil- fuel reserves, species extinctions, long- lasting
pollutants, deadly viruses, and the like. [Problem- specific and
[endlessly innovating techno- managerialism broadcasts]{.mark} the
missive that [there]{.mark} [exists no symptom it cannot
solve]{.mark}---a missive most especially loud and clear in its
[refus]{.mark}al [to tackle]{.mark}, or even look at, [the **root
cause**]{.mark} of all banes]{.underline}.

The [techno- managerial framework [sustains human colonialism]{.mark},
while [angling to contain damage]{.mark} and effect some
cleanup]{.underline}. Whether or not it could succeed in solving or
muddling through the immense quandaries humanity faces, the outcome is
bleak: [[If techno- managerial approaches fail]{.mark} in the mission to
address freshwater shortages, "feed the world," or mitigate dangerous
climate change]{.underline} (to mention three looming issues), [the
[result will be unthinkable suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[If]{.mark}]{.underline} technomanagerial approaches [[succeed in
containing]{.mark} dire [side effects]{.mark} for humanity, while
entrenching human planetary domination, the cosmic gem of [Earth will
be]{.mark} turned into [a]{.mark} downgraded [resource base to
serve]{.mark} human users]{.underline}.

Just as [there is an [underlying driver of]{.mark} the [problems]{.mark}
we face (a [human- supremacist worldview]{.mark} that has
[**underwritten** the biosphere's colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}), so
there is an underlying pattern to the mainstream solution framework (a
diligent avoidance of calling out that worldview). The prevalent techno-
managerial framework for civilization endangering problems zooms the
focus on, and even kindles admiration for, the cleverness of Anthropos
in the face of adversity. By the same token, [this approach safeguards
the [belief]{.mark} [that Earth is the Planet of the Humans]{.mark}: by
never allowing that belief to be unveiled for conscious scrutiny and
rejection; and by rehashing already- acclaimed superior human qualities
as those to be marshaled for moving forward]{.underline}. By silently
summoning the supremacist worldview to the rescue[, the dominant
framework bypasses unmasking that worldview as the very source of all
the problems that managers, technocrats, innovators, securitization
experts, and specialists of all sorts will try to solve]{.underline}.

Indeed, [[techno- managerialism seeks to]{.underline}]{.mark} make the
anthropocentric regime sustainable and thereby [[turn]{.mark} [Earth's
occupation into a success story of civilized
humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}. To wit: [that Earth belongs to humanity;
that the planet consists in resources and services for human
advancement; and that human beings are exceptional by comparison to all
other species]{.underline}. The spell of this belief system seems so
soporifi cally potent that [the civilized [establishment will sooner
assume charge of the]{.mark} [planet]{.mark}ary climate system, [or
swallow]{.mark} the pill of [**mass extinction**, than relinquish that
belief system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### 'Sustainable' Arctic development invests in managerial territorialization of the region which frames nature as needing control

Aapo **Lunden,** 20**22**, \[PhD Researcher at the University of Oulu,
specializing in governance in the Arctic and Sociology, 2022/08/22, "The
biopolitics of Arctic tourism development and sustainability", Via
Tourism Review, https://journals.openedition.org/viatourism/8084\]

This article focused on the production of exceptionality and exceptional
spaces in tourism by analysing current and future visions [concerning
the Arctic as a destination.]{.underline} Here, [the
[(re)production]{.mark} [of the Arctic is]{.mark} understood as [an
Arctification process]{.mark} based on spatial simplification and
strategic essentialisation]{.underline}. This process frames Arctic
increasingly as a place for the purposes of touristic consumption
through a spectrum of planetary care, namely sustainability. The article
looked at [Arctification]{.underline} from a biopolitical perspective
from three dimensions: (I) as exogenous tourism development targeting
mainly global visitors, (II) [as [a spatial strategy based on]{.mark}
de- and re-[territorialisation, and]{.mark} (III) as an ethical stance
on [planetary care through consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through
these three dimensions and by using examples from Finnish Lapland, the
article claims that the Arctification of Northern Europe [ultimately
[frames nature]{.mark} and place [as obsolete]{.mark}. Here, **[Arctic
nature]{.mark}**, climate, and seasonalities [are]{.mark} increasingly
[seen as technical challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}, nuisances hindering
the optimisation and growth of the tourism industry.

36Furthermore, the biopolitical perspective used to explain the
implications of homogenisation effects of globalisation (Relph, 1976;
Ritzer, 2003; Eriksen, 2021) and [ethics of [green consumerism]{.mark}
claimed to lead to a type "Dubaisation" of the Arctic that [aims for
total control]{.mark} of destinations]{.underline}. [Here
**[sustainability is]{.mark} handled as [a managerial]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}and place-detached [problem]{.mark} [that can be dealt
with]{.mark} by better destination design (e.g., domed destinations,
locally decarbonised)]{.underline}, trust in progressive consumer
choices (e.g., appealing to the desire for alterity, environmental care,
and the self) and by promises of a symbiotic tourism-nature
relationship.

[37The consumerist ethics of planetary care]{.underline} is based on the
transformative and pedagogical promise of "meeting" nature as a tourist.
Here, [[nature is framed **ontologically as**]{.mark} **a
[singular]{.mark}** entity (global, planetary)]{.underline} (Swyngedouw,
2007). [Its execution of [sustainability is]{.mark} bordered to the
level destinations and therefore [detached from]{.mark} any references
to [systemic and structural ecological impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
other words, [sustainability is [rendered]{.mark} and sorted as
[manageable]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, [consumerist options
are [based]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on]{.mark}]{.underline}
destination-tied, "just-around-the-corner" [solutionism]{.underline}
(Dempsey, 2016), [where the focus is on [better]{.mark} and more
[technology]{.mark} (e.g., decarbonisation) [and
managerialism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hall, 2019), [[producing
"sustainability" through techno-natural nurturing of the
Earth]{.underline}]{.mark} (Swyngedouw, 2018). Here, tourism and its
track-record are thought of as if there existed an alternate history
where its unsustainabilities were solved. Hence, [sustainability
[presents]{.mark} a translation and [operationalisation of]{.mark}
[planetary ethics into]{.mark} a patchwork of **[solutions and
products]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., carbon compensation schemes,
ecotourism). Ultimately, these [sustainable solutions [aim for instant
gratification]{.mark}]{.underline} of touristic experiences in situ, to
elevate and secure the tourism experience [[by disassociating]{.mark}
the experience [from]{.mark} its [environmental
impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, sustainability needs to be
understood as an essential dimension of Arctic marketing and branding in
selling an idea and solutions for environmental fragility. Thus, it
presents a model for transforming the experience of consumption into
compensation, leading to sustenance rather than limiting the sector's
negative impacts.

[38Through Arctification, destinations and [regions are imagined]{.mark}
and promoted as territories of sustainability that [compensate for the
**chronic unsustainabilities**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} modern Western
[societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, sustainability presents a sign
to locate a safe space to consume without questioning tourism itself.
For contemporary large-scale tourism development projects, the aim is to
find ways to sustain tourism and touristic consumption in an
environmentally troublesome reality by stabilising and immunising
destinations (e.g., enclaves) and their environments (e.g., artificial
snowing, domes) from the unstable nature of nature. Alas, [the
[Arctic]{.mark} environment is]{.underline} becoming too needy for the
tourism industry, [too un-optimal and risk-laden. Therefore, it [needs
to become]{.mark}]{.underline} [[disenchanted from]{.mark} on-going
global and local environmental [reality,]{.mark} re-territorialised [and
rationalised through Arctification]{.mark}]{.underline} to secure its
promises as an Arctic destination. Ultimately, the Arctification
[represents a]{.underline} tourism and tourist [[development
mode]{.mark} wrapped in [problematic]{.mark} logics of [green
growth]{.mark} aiming for predictability [through control]{.mark} and
stability [of nature]{.mark}, the consumer, and the self]{.underline}.

#### The desire to [control the climate]{.underline} and [terraform the Earth]{.underline} is managerialist.

The 'three Rs' of [**[environmental studies]{.mark}** now implicitly
[acknowledge how]{.mark} thoroughly most [**human ecologies** on Earth
are 'a **socio‐technical order**]{.mark}]{.underline}'. As Law suggests,
the networks of humans and machines, animals and plants, economies and
ecologies, which now constitute our environment, are mixed media of
power and knowledge: 'what appears to be social is partly technical.
What we usually call technical is partly social. In practice nothing
is purely technical. Neither is anything purely social' (Law 1991: 10).
Approaching the environment as terrestrial infrastructure, at the same
time, admits that the professional--technical graduates of environmental
studies programmes are in many ways trained to operate as 'heterogeneous
engineers.' That is, the eco‐managerialist must work 'not only on
inanimate physical materials, but on and through people, texts, devices,
city councils, architectures, economics, and all the rest,' such that if
his/her designs are to work as a system, then he/she always must travel
effectively 'between these different domains, weaving an emergent web
which constituted and reconstituted bits and pieces that it brought
together' (Law 1991: 9).

[[Few]{.mark} articulations of [environmental studies acknowledge these
basic **operational conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but they form the
socio‐technical terrains upon which eco‐managerialists must negotiate
their professional work lives in order to heterogeneously engineer
Earth\'s ecologies as the infrastructures of anthropogenic environments.
Transforming the raw stuff of nature into natural resources, while
minimizing the associated risks of such processing and maximizing the
aggregate access of recreationists to yet‐to‐be or never‐to‐be
transformed nature, is a constant challenge for heterogeneous engineers
from the environmental science disciplines. Likewise, the **[[green
fixation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of so many environmental activists
[[makes it]{.mark} difficult, if not [impossible, for]{.mark}
environmental s[tudies to recognize all of the]{.mark}
natural/artificial [**networks** that environmental experts must
oversee]{.mark}]{.underline} in their projects of heterogeneous
engineering. Owning up to [these immense tasks, however, leads those who
would be the tenders of nature to the project of '[**terraforming**', or
**reshaping the earth**]{.mark} so completely that [it becomes an
essentially **planetary order** of complex socio‐technical
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [earth **no longer** is allowed to **exist** or **evolve** as
such]{.mark}]{.underline}; instead it has been consigned to
[**terraforming professionals** with graduate training in the
environmental sciences]{.underline}. Duke University asserts 'the
mission of the School of the Environment is education, research and
service to understand basic environmental processes and to protect and
enhance the environment and its natural resources for future
generations' (Duke Nicholas School 1996a: 9). This [[engagement
at]{.mark} 'protecting' and ['enhancing' the environment]{.mark} to
transmit its **natural resources** to future generations]{.underline} is
seconded by California‐Berkeley, whose Ecosystem Sciences mission
statement virtually writes the job description of terraforming
technicians: 'Ecosystem Sciences are concerned with quantitative
understanding of ecosystem properties and processes, and the controls on
these features. Central to this mission is a full partnership between
physical and biological scientists, leading to an integrated
understanding of ecosystem structure and function, and the extension of
these findings in modeling and implementation activities' (Department of
Environmental Science 1996: 2). The labour of [**[ecomanagerialist
professionals]{.mark}** must be [dedicated to]{.mark}
protecting and [enhancing the **performativity** of our
environments]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Use of technology in nature and exploration will always create damage

**DeLuca \'05** (Kevin Michael -- Professor of Environmental Humanities

Heidegger: Rethinking Environmental Theory and Practice\", 2005, Indiana
University Press, Ethics & the Environment, Volume 10, Number 1, pp.

In addition to meditating on media and public relations practices, a
careful reading of Heidegger would compel environmentalism to meditate
on its relations to technology and to images. To address the issue of
technology first, environmental groups often rely on modern technology
while writing off such use as a necessary cost of 'doing business' in a
modern, mass media public sphere. That may be true, but Heidegger's
writings caution us against gliding over the writing off. [What are the
costs of using modern technology]{.underline}? Besides relying on the
technological infrastructure of the communication industry (computers,
telephones, video camcorders, etc. . . .) to appear on TV, issue press
releases, maintain web sites, lobby politicians, and raise money,
environmentalists in the course of working and living rely on cars,
planes, air conditioning, highways, microwaves, electricity, and a
plethora of plastic products. In short, **[[environmentalists are
implicated and imbricated in the technosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Now Heidegger's meditation on the essence of technology and the essence
of humanity's relation to technology serves to displace the conventional
questions concerning technology. Heidegger refuses the question of
whether technology is good or bad or neutral. As he puts it,
"[Everywhere [we]{.mark} [remain]{.mark} unfree and [chained to
technology]{.mark}, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we
are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as
something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we
particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of
technology]{.underline}" (1993, 311--12). Instead, Heidegger is asking
after the essence of technology, which, he famously declares, "is by no
means anything technological" (1993, 311). Rejecting the understanding
of technology as a "mere means" that humans can master, what he terms
the merely correct but not true "instrumental and anthropological
definition of technology" (1993, 312), Heidegger proposes technology as
"a way of revealing" (1993, 318).

Avoiding the romanticism of a return to the Pleistocene or the
utopianism of embracing a Star Trek futurism, from a Heideggerian
perspective the question becomes, "[What sort of revealing does a
particular regime of technology make possible]{.underline}?" More
prosaically, what sort of relationships to the earth and world does a
technology enable? To this question, Heidegger provides a stinging
[critique of modern technology]{.underline} \[albeit, admittedly,
tempered by an ontological hope (see 1993, 333--41)\]. The [way of
revealing of [modern technology]{.mark} is]{.underline} Gestell or
[enframing]{.underline}: "The revealing that rules throughout modern
technology has the character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a
challenging-forth. . . . a challenging, **[which [puts to nature
the]{.mark} unreasonable [demand that it supply energy which can be
extracted]{.mark} and stored as such]{.underline}**" (1993, 321, 320).
[Nature, then, is reduced to a "standing-reserve . . . a calculable
coherence of forces"]{.underline} (1993, 322, 326),6 so that "nature
reports itself in some way or other that is identifiable through
calculation and that it remains orderable as a system of information"
(1993, 328).7 [Heidegger gives examples from the fields of agriculture
and energy that ring even more true today]{.underline} (see 1993,
320--21). Of farming, Heidegger writes:

The work of the peasant does not challenge the soil of the field. In
sowing grain it places seed in the keeping of the forces of growth and
watches over its increase. But meanwhile even the cultivation of the
field has come under the grip of another kind of setting-in-order, which
sets upon nature. It sets upon it in the sense of challenging it.
[[Agriculture is now the mechanized food industry]{.underline}]{.mark}.
(1993, 320)

Of course, the all-too-immediate reaction to such an example is to
charge Heidegger with a dangerous romanticism. With the benefit of a few
decades experience around the world with the products of the mechanized
food industry, from tasteless food, soil erosion, and ubiquitous
pesticides to emptied communities, alienated consumers, and green
imperialism, in retrospect Heidegger's critique seems understated. More
significantly, though, the question is not a moral one of good or bad
but an exploration of what possible ways of relating to nature are
opened and foreclosed with different practices of revealing. Heidegger
himself dismisses the possibility of romanticism in response to the
giganticism and the progress of science, "whose onset can neither be
hindered nor even held up in any way, by any romantic remembering of
what was earlier and different" (1999, 108). Indeed, [Heidegger's
fundamental [critique of]{.mark} modern [tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark}
not [directed at]{.mark} the world it reveals but [the world it
erases]{.mark}]{.underline}:

Where this ordering holds sway, it drives out every other possibility of
revealing. Above all, enframing conceals that revealing which, in the
sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forth into appearance. As
compared with that other revealing, the setting-upon that challenges
forth thrusts man into a relation to whatever is that is at once
antithetical and rigorously ordered. Where enframing holds sway,
regulating and securing of the standing-reserve mark all revealing.
(1993, 332)

[[The problem]{.mark}, then, [is]{.mark} not [that nature is]{.mark}
seen as "standing-reserve," a "calculable coherence of forces," but that
that is all it can be [seen]{.mark} as]{.underline}.

The practice of enframing also has deleterious effects on humanity. In
connection with erasure, it blinkers humanity's vision of the earth.
"[Thus [when]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~man~~ [\[[humanity]{.mark}\],
[investigat]{.mark}ing, [observing]{.mark}, [pursues nature as an area
of]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~his~~ [\[[their]{.mark}\] [own
conceiving]{.mark},]{.underline} ~~he~~ [\[[they]{.mark}\] has already
been claimed by a way of revealing that challenges]{.underline} ~~him~~
[\[them\] to [approach nature as an **object of research**]{.mark},
[until]{.mark} even [the object disappears into the]{.mark}
objectlessness [of standing-reserve]{.mark}]{.underline}" (1993, 324).
Further, enframing [reduces [humanity]{.mark} itself [as the orderer of
the standing-reserve]{.mark}]{.underline}:

As soon as what is unconcealed no longer concerns man even as object,
but exclusively as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of
objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the standing-reserve, then
he comes to the very brink of a precipitous fall; that is, he comes to
the point where he himself will have to be taken as standing-reserve.
Meanwhile, man, precisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself and
postures as lord of the earth. In this way the illusion comes to prevail
that everything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his
construct. This illusion gives rise in turn to one final delusion: it
seems as though man everywhere and always encounters only himself.
(1993, 332)

The ensuing decades have elaborated on Heidegger's insight. The worst
tendencies in postmodern theory can be read as illustrating the illusion
that everything humanity encounters exists only insofar as it is a human
construct. [More significant is how this conceit of [humanity as lord
of]{.mark} the [earth]{.mark} [manifests itself in environmental
discourses]{.mark}, so, in a common example, [humans need to
save]{.mark} the [rainforests because]{.mark} unknown [cures for]{.mark}
human [diseases may be]{.mark} found [in them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

How this dangerous dynamic reduces humans to standing-reserve plays
itself out in the example of the forester:

The forester who measures the felled timber in the woods and who to all
appearances walks the forest path in the same way his grandfather did is
today ordered by the industry that produces commercial woods, whether he
knows it or not. He is made subordinate to the orderability of
cellulose, which for its part is challenged forth by the need for paper,
which is then delivered to newspapers and illustrated magazines. The
latter, in their turn, set public opinion to swallowing what is printed,
so that a set configuration of opinion becomes available on demand.
(1993, 323)

This example is useful in its [exposure of how [modern technology's
ordering of nature is]{.mark} also [an ordering of humanity and a
reduction of both to standing-reserve]{.mark}]{.underline}. The example
is further noteworthy for its illustration of how modern technology is a
system or regime, not a particular device. Modern technology is not the
chainsaw. Rather, it is the chainsaw and forestry science and the
transportation system and the profession of journalism and printing
presses and public relations and mass communication technologies and the
machinery of politics and. . . . It is this system that
enframes/ensnares/produces a particular version of nature and a
particular type of humanity.

[In modern times, [the world-making narrative of human
ascendancy]{.mark} and nonhuman demotion [was secured in collective
consciousness by being submerged into concepts]{.mark} that directly
emerged out of the inherited worldview [that **the natural world is
beneath and for humans**]{.mark}. [The most overarching]{.mark} of
modern-age anthropocentric concepts [is that of natural
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} linguistically
[crystallized the]{.mark}]{.underline} post-Cartesian secular [[view of
nature as purely material]{.mark} , mechanical , [and **lacking inherent
purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} . 4 In the classical and Christian eras,
Western thought championed the belief that animals , plants , minerals ,
and \"savages\" existed , or were created by God , for human use . This
doctrine laid the sturdy foundation for the modern-secular concept of
resources to emerge : [Nature as a whole became a domain for human use
and advancement]{.underline} . Indeed , the very category of \"nature\"
co-emerged with its construction as precisely such a domain . 5

[[The concept of resources not only foregrounds instrumentalism the lens
of viewing things as]{.mark} [useable and profitable]{.mark}-but being
general , content-less , and spiritless , it [enables]{.mark}
instrumentalism [to engulf]{.mark} the entire [reality]{.mark}
field]{.underline} . [[Resources is a label]{.mark} that can be foisted
on anything]{.underline} : soil, water , animals , minerals , rivers ,
forests , grasslands , and even extraterrestrial territories like the
moon and other planetary bodies . [It [casts a blanket of
inertness]{.mark} or gross materiality [over the substance of the
world]{.mark} , [whose aliveness]{.mark} and self-integrity [are
denied]{.mark} or shunted into irrelevancy .]{.underline}
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} master [**[concept legitimates]{.mark}
[taking and using]{.mark}** , because it describes the world in ways
precisely intended to invite taking and using]{.underline} .
[[The]{.mark} instrumental]{.underline} reasoning and [[justification
for domination inherent in \"natural resources\"
attained]{.mark}]{.underline} altogether [[new heights through the
industrial subjugation of soil, land , seas, animals , plants , and
biomes by means of technologies]{.mark} invented and implemented without
ethics]{.underline}. [The amoral modality of industrial technology maps
onto the concept of resources-for \"[resources\" are constituted as
lacking inherent standing]{.mark}]{.underline} . [Amoral
[tech]{.mark}nology conforms to, as well as [reinforces , the idea of
natural resources because setting upon the world in accordance with that
idea]{.mark} concretizes and [legitimates it]{.mark}.]{.underline}
People can thus countenance battery chickens , lopped-off mountains ,
endless monocultures , and industrial fishnets bursting with fish not as
crimes against nature , but as the way things are.

[[The pervasive]{.mark} and customary [use of \"natural resources\"
makes it appear a normal way of talking about the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} , as a language containing no agenda. It is
worth scrutinizing what kind of relationship to the biosphere this
ostensibly neutral concept fosters. [[The term \"resources]{.mark} ,\"
simply put , [designates the world in terms of its **disposability for
human**]{.mark} needs , wants , and desires. \"Natural resources ,\"
[while seemingly]{.mark} an [objective]{.mark} referent to (nonliving
and living) entities , **[tacitly reconfigures the natural world as
human owned]{.mark}**]{.underline} . The concept entirely bypasses , and
via its ceaseless use ends up erasing , the natural world\'s intrinsic
standing . Indeed , [the concept of resources preempts human thought
from even moving in the direction of understanding nonhuman nature in
terms of its intrinsic being . \"[Resources \" prefigures and
**justifies the assault on the natural world**]{.mark} .]{.underline}
Nonstop exploitation is thus codependent with the omnipresent idea of
natural resources-an idea that is beholden to , and a subterraneous
continuation of, the historical legacy that nature\'s very purpose is to
serve humanity . [[The transfiguration of nature into resources **shapes
human thought and action at such an all-encompassing level** that people
end up perceiving the biosphere through this single
framework]{.mark}.]{.underline} An alternative way of relating with the
nonhuman realm and another way of seeing it become erased or profoundly
attenuated .

[[Nature\'s configuration as resources is a]{.mark} supremacy-laden
[concept with the power to abet anything]{.mark}-[decapitating mountains
, stripmining seafloors , damming rivers , fracking land and seabed ,
building roads wherever]{.mark}]{.underline} , or piling domestic
animals into neon-lit , sickening facilities and stuffing them with
unnatural foods and substances . Liquidating others , be they places or
beings , is built into the concept of resources and operationalized in
practice . [[Resources is an umbrella concept that provides a]{.mark}
readymade , unassailable **[rationale for appropriating even that which
has yet to be taken]{.mark}** .]{.underline} For example , [[a panoply
of technologies]{.mark} , planned actions , and legal arrangements are
in place to seize the apple-sized polymetallic]{.underline} (or
manganese) [[nodules]{.mark} , which exist]{.underline} , in apparently
great numbers , [[on the ocean\'s floor]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These
\"resources\" contain]{.underline}]{.mark} manganese , nickel , copper ,
and other [[valuables]{.mark}: the only reason [they have not yet been
mined]{.mark} on a big scale is that they are not low-hanging
fruit-[they are hard to access and]{.mark} their lucrative contents
[require much processing]{.mark} to extract.]{.underline} Mining the
nodules , however , remains one more catastrophe to add to the other
catastrophes visited on the ocean . [[What]{.mark} [makes it
expectable]{.mark} and normal [is that]{.mark}]{.underline} (lo and
behold) [polymetallic [nodules have]{.mark} already [been gifted to
humanity by means of the concept of resources]{.mark} , [which
frames]{.mark} not only what has hitherto been grasped but [anything

when military solutions seem or are necessary, as the defeat of the Nazi
regime during World War II, there was a back story about how a failed
peace encouraged military ascendancy. This failed peace could be seen in
draconian conditions imposed on Germans or through deals arms
contractors in countries like Sweden made with German military
contractors to subvert the Treaty of Versailles.

Case I: Afghanistan as a Test of Military Managerialism's Virtue

Consider the case of Afghanistan where women's rights were undermined by
militarism, not just of the U.S. mujahedeen variety. As Simar Sachar
explains in the Journal of International Affairs, "The overt
politicization of Afghan women, their rights, and their role within
society can be traced back to 1978 when a coup d'état resulted in the
fall of Daud Khan's government, and commenced the bloody militarization
of communist factions and mujahedeen. The subsequent history of
Afghanistan's ongoing war has intensified the exclusion of Afghan women
from the social, political, and economic arenas." The story is more
complicated than the U.S. destabilizing a pro-feminist Soviet Regime as
William Malley explains in an World Development essay, where he writes:
"In early 1980, regime troops fired on a peaceful demonstration by
school-girls protesting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, killing a
number of them including the leader of the protest, Nahid...Women in
rural areas frequently were victims of atrocities by the regime's
forces...Such atrocities attracted not the faintest word of public
protest from official women's groups, confirming their status as mere
mouthpieces of their male party superiors. While \[Valentine M.\]
Moghadam notes that the male death rate exceeded the female..., she
fails to note that according to the most detailed study of causes of
unnatural deaths during the Afghan war, 76.7% of female deaths resulted
from aerial bombings --- that is, from the use of weapons to which only
the regime and its Soviet allies had access." By synthesizing Allen,
Felbab-Brown, Sachar and Malley we can see how militarism of the U.S. or
Soviet-aligned variety ends up limiting women's rights and
possibilities, even if some progress is made at particular times because
of what militarism provides, e.g. even Daud Khan gained power from a
military coup. The underlying conflict among dominant militarisms,
however, clearly undermined women's possibilities. As the Revolutionary
Association of the Women of Afghanistan explained during the first days
of the US occupation of Afghanistan: "The continuation of US attacks and
the increase in the number of innocent civilian victims not only gives
an excuse to the Taliban, but also will cause the empowerment of the
fundamentalist forces in the region and even in the world." In other
words, [opposing militarisms feed one another]{.underline}, just as even
competing soda brands increase the larger market for soda consumption.

Case II: The January 6th Insurrection

In the case of the January 6th insurrection, some of the active elements
were socialized by the U.S. military and some participants were
associated with the military (at least eighty) and police forces.
Moreover, [the [Trump]{.mark} Administration]{.underline} both helped
aggravate the Covid crisis (which helped feed the insurrection) and was
[[**a clear patron** of military **expansionism**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Trump supported various military interests. It is true that elements of
the national security apparatus and top military figures helped
constrain or attacked Trump. Nevertheless, John M. Donnelly in Roll Call
recently explained on January 3, 2022, that "defense contractors
bankrolled campaigns of election objectors." Donnelly referred to a
report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics to explain that
"leading [[defense contractors]{.mark} were [among the most
generous]{.mark}]{.underline} corporate [[contributors
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[campaigns of]{.underline}]{.mark} members
of [[Congress who voted **not to certify** the 2020]{.underline}]{.mark}
presidential election [[results]{.underline}]{.mark} in Arizona or
Pennsylvania." Another report explains "according to the most recent
Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, defense contractors last
month donated to more than one-third of the 147 Republicans who objected
to the Electoral College vote." The delays and constraints on quickly
deploying the National Guard to help remove January 6th protestors
undermines the idea the current configuration and expansion of military
power adequately serves the public's interests. The [[military failed
to]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} the 9-11 and January 6 security
[[crises illustrating]{.mark} the [**limits** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
simply expanding traditional [[military]{.mark} power [as a
mech]{.mark}anism [to **secure defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Technologies of enhancement and optimization treat the human into a
standing reserve to be streamlined and upgraded**

**Kristensen \'22** (Dorthe Brogård -- Professor in consumption studies
@ University of Southern Denmark, \"The Optimised and Enhanced Self:
Experiences of the Self and the Making of Societal Values\", 3-24-2022,
The Palgrave Handbook of the Anthropology of Technology, Ch. 30,
DOI:10.1007/978-981-16-7084-8_30//phs-maubu)

The question---'what is a human being?'---is central to current debates
on enhancement and optimisation. As argued by Van Den Eede (2015),
theorists from a range of different backgrounds have searched for the
human being amid technology: a search that takes multiple forms as
critique, defence, or a mixture of both. From a 'pre-postmodern'
viewpoint, also referred to as instrumentalism, technology was viewed as
a means to an end (Van Den Eede 2015, p. 151). Later, a critical
perspective---the substantivist view---[emerged wherein
[technology]{.mark} was [no longer seen as a neutral object serving to
enhance human]{.mark} purposes and this has, [to]{.mark} a great extent,
[served as a background for]{.mark} scholarly [work on]{.mark} both
[optimisation]{.mark} and enhancement]{.underline}.

[An understanding of the term [optimisation]{.mark} was initially
proposed by Heidegger]{.underline} (Dreyfus 1997), who is regarded by
interpreters as a representative of the substantivist view (Van Den Eede
2015). In his essay, 'The Question Concerning Technology' (1977),
[Heidegger presented a very sceptical account [of technology]{.mark},
one [inspired]{.mark} by industrial growth and **[the horrors caused by
weapons of mass destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To Heidegger,
[technology involves the disclosure of reality; thus, the essence of
technology is a 'mode of revealing' as human beings bring themselves
forth through the use of technology]{.underline}. Consequently, reality
is understood in terms of what is available to, and what can be
controlled by, human beings. Heidegger suggests that the essence of
modern technology is to seek increasingly greater flexibility and
efficiency simply for its own sake: 'expediting is always itself
directed from the beginning \... [towards [driving]{.mark} on
[to]{.mark} the [max]{.mark}imum [yield at]{.mark} the [minimum
expense]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (1977, p. 15). As a result, [[not
only nature but also humanity becomes]{.mark} [standing reserves]{.mark}
of raw material, something that is available [for production and
manipulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we will see later in the chapter,
this view of technologies' potential for dehumanising and alienation
runs through the writings of sociology and the bioethicist debate on
enhancement.

The term technologies of optimisation was introduced by the sociologist
Nikolas Rose (2007) to designate medical technologies that, he argues,
do not seek merely to cure diseases but also to control the vital
processes of the body and mind. In his work Rose (2007) overlaps his use
of the terms enhancement and optimisation and proposes a more nuanced
view of technologies, indicating both their disciplining and empowering
affordances. What is new is not so much the technology, but that human
beings have entered the age of 'biological control' where they shoulder
much greater responsibility in the realms of the biological (Rose 2007,
p. 16). [The key feature of technologies of optimisation is a
forward-looking vision, as they seek to 'reshape the vital future by
action in the vital present']{.underline} (Rose 2007, p. 18). [The [new
processes of the self]{.mark}]{.underline} can also be regarded as
giving rise to an 'entrepreneurial self' (Sennett 1998) [wherein the
bodily self is [perceived as **a personal enterprise** under the
efficiency]{.mark} regime [of **managerialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This goes hand in hand with developments in so- called neoliberal
governance structures, whereby the responsibility for an optimised self
(in terms of age, health, productivity, etc.) is increasingly
transferred from collective systems to the individual (Lupton 1995).
According to the sociologist Emily Martin, this is associated with the
shrinking of social institutions, leading to the individual becoming a
site for investment perceived as 'flexible collections of assets'
(Martin 2000, p. 582). Hence, Martin argues, [[people
increasingly]{.mark} come to [speak of themselves as mini-corporations
and as projects that must]{.mark} continually be invested in, nurtured,
managed, and **[developed]{.mark}**. [Embedded in the urge to **manage**
and improve]{.mark} the performance of the self is the administrative
practice of performance reviews, from corporate organisations to
educational and creative institutions, from managers and employees to
individual entrepreneurs of their own selves.]{.underline}

'[Smart bombs' are neither smart nor moral]{.underline}. The use of
Hellﬁre missiles to carry out the targeted assassination of alleged
terrorists---as in the case of the targeting of the Hussein brothers in
downtown Mosul---is morally and legally problematic. As PW Singer's
Wired for war (2009) underscores, t[he use of stand-off
[technologies]{.mark} and]{.underline} ~~unmanned~~ [\[uncrewed\]
vehicles in such surgical strikes can [create a
**videogame**]{.mark}/voyeur-istic [approach to warfare]{.mark} in which
[military personnel]{.mark} who [control]{.mark} these [drones from
remote locations lose touch with]{.mark} the [realities]{.mark} of the
battleﬁeld]{.underline} (Singer 2009).The use of similar weaponry,
including battle-ready robots, which might [result in the
[killing]{.mark} of [innocent civilians due to technical
malfunction]{.mark} or faulty intelligence-gathering and
communications]{.underline}, is more obviously questionable. In January
2002, former Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz expressed hopes for the
impending US military campaigns: they aimed 'to apply a very small force
on the ground and leverage it in a dramatic way not only through
precision-guided munitions but through precision communications that
would get those munitions accurately to the right target instead of
accurately to the wrong target'. Wolfowitz's comment, unlike Rumsfeld's,
[seems to acknowledge the [danger]{.mark} of [relying]{.mark} too
heavily [on technological precision]{.mark} in the formation of
strategy]{.underline}, by concluding that 'accuracy by itself doesn't do
you any good if your target identiﬁcation is wrong' (cited in Soloman
2007, 82). His comment seems to apply equally to the use of PGM and any
future [developments]{.underline} of battle-ready robots, both of which
could [be used to moral or immoral ends depending on the plans and
purposes of military commanders.]{.underline}

At ﬁrst glance, it seems that Wolfowitz understood at least one of the
moral lessons of precision-guided munitions, namely that 'precision' is
only as good as the intelligence that is used in a given targeting
cycle. Learning this lesson, however, can lead to ethically problematic
conclusions. As Kaag has argued, 'Painting' and destroying speciﬁc enemy
targets with laser-guided accuracy depends on the reliability of
intelligence, and this intelligence is often garnered from the
interrogation and coercion of enemy prisoners. The demands of PGM and
robotic targeting, the need to specify an enemy's exact position and
character, may place undue burden on interrogators who feel responsible
for providing this information (Kaag 2008). Wolfowitz's seemingly
cautious remark concerning PGM must be understood in the wider scope of
the global war on terror. On 27 December2001, a week before Wolfowitz's
comment, Rumsfeld (at that point, Wolfowitz's immediate superior)
announced the establishment of Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for
detainees. The interrogation techniques used at this site, many of which
were previously used to 'break' trainees at the Armed Forces
SERE(Survival Evasion Resistance Escape) School, were sanctioned by DoD
ofﬁcials in the months surrounding Wolfowitz's comments concerning the
use of PGM.

We are not claiming that the [[development of military
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} directly cause abuse or torture; this
would be overstating the point. We are, however, suggesting that the
demand to use precision-guided munitions and military robotics in a
moral way will place unprecedented pressure on interrogators to garner
the intelligence to identify appropriate targets. [This [may have
already resulted in compromising the]{.mark} standards set by the
[Geneva Convention]{.mark} for the treatment of prisoners of
war]{.underline}, or, more likely, the wholesale dismissal of these
standards. Exposing the relationship between military technology and
interrog-ation practices is not meant to shift responsibility away from
the strategists and commanders who enact morally questionable policies.
Instead, we echo writers such as Bauman and Coward by observing that the
[[structures of **technology and bureaucracy**]{.mark} can [contribute
to]{.mark} the articulation of new forms [violence while masking
the]{.mark} unique and deeply [problematic character of this
violence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Coward2009, 45). There is in this case a
complex symbiosis between stand-off and precision weaponry and the
intelligence-gathering techniques that might inform its use. This point
is driven home when we come to recognize that even the initiation of the
Iraq War, undoubtedly the most technologically advanced war ever waged,
was motivated by allegedly savage interrogation procedures. Stephen
Gray, who investigated Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) detention
centres, alleges that the supposed connection between al-Qaeda and
Saddam Hussein was corroborated by intelligence gathered from Iban al
Shakh al Libby, who provided this information only after being tortured
in prisons in Egypt (Agence France Press 2006).

Much more could be said about this topic in light of the history of
philosophy. For example, Friedrich Schiller wrote his Aesthetic letters
in 1794, in the midst of another age of war. He suggests that human
beings forfeit their humanity in two distinct ways. On the one hand,
they could turn to savagery in which one prioritizes feeling and emotion
over reason and science, in his words, 'when feeling predominates over
principle'. On the other, [they could become barbarians and [could
prioritize science and techne at the expense of human feeling and
sentiment]{.mark},]{.underline} in Schiller's words, 'when principle
destroys feeling' (Schiller 2004, 34). Schiller's warning comes home to
us when we examine the relationship between [[advanced military
tech]{.mark}nologies, forms of techne that aim to [remove all human
feeling and sentiment]{.mark} from the battleﬁeld]{.underline}, and
recent methods of intelligence-gathering, methods that appear to break
basic ethical principles. Indeed, such an investigation may expose the
unique way in which barbarism and savagery enable one another in the
course of modern warfare.

Conclusion In the dialogue Protagoras, Plato recounts the myth of
Prometheus bringing technology to humankind. [The gift of techne
threatened to [result in the **destruction of all humans**]{.mark},
since humans lacked any standards for the proper use of these dangerous
powers]{.underline}. Zeus, fearing the possible extermination of humans,
sent Hermes to deliver them the gift of justice (dike) to bring order
and conciliation to men as a necessary supplement to technology.
Moreover, Zeus insisted that the knowledge of justice be distributed
among all people, and not given merely to a small number of experts,
for, he says, 'cities cannot be formed if only a few have a share of
these as of other arts \[technon\]' (Plato 1990, 321-- 323).Plato's
warning about the relation between [techne and ethics is even more valid
[in an age when technology can cause far more
damage]{.mark}]{.underline} far more quickly than was imaginable to the
ancient Greeks. [The seductive power of [technology promises 'war on the
cheap',]{.mark}]{.underline} cheap both in blood and in treasure, and,
even more importantly, it holds out the possibility of a war puriﬁed of
all moral tragedy. [Technology perpetually [threatens to coopt
ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Efﬁcient means tend to become ends in
themselves by means of the 'technological imperative' in which it
becomes perceived as morally permissible to use a tool merely because we
have it (often by means of the fallacious argument that if we don't use
it someone else will). Or the very ease of striking a target becomes the
rationale for doing so; the technology determines what counts as a
legitimate military target rather than vice versa. The allure of the
technocratic ideal reverses Plato's warning by promising that ethics can
be made into a ﬁeld of expert knowledge, circumventing the difﬁcult
process of moral deliberation and judgment. The fantasy of 'robot
soldiers' is but the extreme of all of these trends; here moral choice
is taken out of the hands of human soldiers and indeed of humans
altogether, and the technocratic expert is the technology itself, the
machine making accurate moral choices. [We have argued here that
[tech]{.mark}nology [can never eliminate the challenge of difﬁcult moral
choices]{.mark} and moral dilemmas, [though it]{.mark} is in the very
nature of technology to [**continually tempt** us to think it
can]{.mark} do so.]{.underline} This dangerous illusion results in
inappropriately low thresholds for the decision to go to war, a failure
to engage in moral deliberation on such tricky moral issues as targeted
assassination, and the paradox of pushing us into even greater moral
wrongs such as torture in order to provide the precise intelligence
needed for technology to be successful. [[Techne is]{.mark} even [a
threat to democracy itself]{.mark}, insofar as it permits
[leaders]{.mark} to [manipulate the public with the promise of a
**perfectly just war** due to modern intelligence and '**smart'
weaponry**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But moral judgement will always be
difﬁcult and controversial in all circumstances, and above all in war,
where the cost in human life and welfare is so high and where
'collateral damage' is inevitable. Technology has great potential to
make war less destructive and to avoid harming innocent bystanders. [Yet
[tech]{.mark}nology [can never be a substitute for ethics]{.mark}
itself; the decision to go to war, and the means of ﬁghting war, will
always belong in human hands]{.underline}.

A managerialist and modernistic epistemological predilection

Within organization and management writing it is primarily
[[managerialistic]{.underline}]{.mark} accounts which [make
[reference]{.mark} to [military affairs]{.mark} and
insights]{.underline} (e.g. Popper, 1996; Grattan, 2003; Talbot, 2003;
Bailey, 2005). In so doing, and with respect for the manner in which
modernism constructs linear and delineated representations, these
accounts [suggest that "[things military]{.mark}" [can be represented
and discussed as an identifiable and discrete
realm]{.mark}.]{.underline} Within such applications, [[managerialistic
commentaries]{.underline}]{.mark} have a tendency to focus on particular
themes, [typically [embrac]{.mark}ing [leadership, teambuilding,
strategy and planning]{.mark}]{.underline} (Winsor, 1996; Grattan,
2003). Modernistic-managerialistic oriented literature suggests
potential interfaces, comparisons and complementarity between what
operates as the notional "military" and, for the purposes of the
discussion, "non-military" (deemed as separate and distinct from
"military" -- and often termed "civilian") (Cohen, 2004). Moreover,
modernistic accounts see this as [leading ultimately to a reciprocal
utility for the [purpose of heightening competitive
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the case of the corporate domain,
and, for the military sphere, "[[updating]{.mark}" and improving
"[efficiency]{.mark}" and gleaning "best practice"]{.underline} from the
"non-military" -- corporate and organizational sectors. The overall
implication is that the military is a worthy partner with which to
engage in reciprocal learning. There is little or no mention of a
sociological and political dimension or perspective in these exchanges.

A privileging of militarized discourse and language

[Use of **[militaristic language]{.mark}** is the most commonly
recognised military [characteristic in **managerialistic**]{.mark}
**[lit]{.mark}erature** strands]{.underline}. This is particularly
frequent in practitioner-oriented texts\[2\] where multifarious examples
can be located:

Barclays battles to boost pensions take-up (People Management, 2004, p.
12).

Benefits packages play key role in war for talent (Richards, 2005, p.
17).

President Nixon's war on cancer (Turney, 2005).

Fineman and Gabriel (1996, p. 73) show that wider concerns regarding
this phenomenon are longstanding:

What is different about today's organizations seems to be the sense that
business is only about winning; every day appears to be a fighting day,
in which battles are won and lost, reputations are made and destroyed,
alliances are struck and broken, opponents are out-manoeuvred,
neutralized and defeated. The very vocabulary of business has been
invaded by [[military terminology]{.mark} -- strategy (the art of
generalship), tactics, raids, targets, penetration, outflanking,
ambushes, predators, sieges, flak, piracy.]{.underline}

[Metaphorical military allusions are thus replete in managerialist
commentary]{.underline}. The military perspective has left an indelible
mark on the structure and function of business practice and theory. It
is in many respects a habitual part of the management lexicon (Winsor,
1996, p. 34; Cronin, 2001). Such language seeks, however contestedly, to
authenticate, legitimate and reinforce "non-military" contexts and
discourse and as such it seeks to provide the impression that the
resultant discussion or event is more "effective" due to the use of this
language (Giacalone and Rosenfeld, 1991).

Habitually cited texts

A further prevalent feature of [the modernistic-[managerialistic
engagement is a reliance on]{.mark} a particular set of commonly cited
[military writings]{.mark}]{.underline}. These texts are frequently
invoked and applied to management and organizational issues and
contexts. Repeatedly cited texts include Sun Tzu's (circa 500 BC), The
Art of War, Machiavelli's (1532), The Prince, Clausewitz's (1832), On
War. It is notable that these works in particular seem to represent the
central canon of military and militaristic writings which are applied to
organization and management (e.g. see Krause, 1996; Hou, 1997, Lee et
al. 1998; Lo et al., 1998; The Economist, 2002, p. 20; Wu et al., 2004).
From these seminal works, a range of texts has been generated applying
military principles to business management and organizations.
Grandiose-entitled examples of this militarized genre are plentiful, for
example: Sun Tzu: The Art of War for Executives(Krause, 1996); From
Battlefield to Boardroom: Winning Strategies for Today's Global Business
(Laurie, 2001) and Alexander the Great -- The Art of Strategy (Bose,
2003). Winsor (1996, p. 34) signals this as an increase in
"organizational militarism" which he notes as "exaltation of military
virtues and ideals" that ". . .has experienced an impressive
renaissance". He suggests that such texts "[[tend to cast **senior
managers** in the role of]{.mark} [general]{.mark}, [**middle managers**
as lieutenants]{.mark} and sergeants and [the rest of the **employees**
as foot soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}". He equally observes the
prevalence of the male voice and machismo as the dominant atmospheres.

In contrast to the habitually cited military texts, there have been a
more limited number of interventions that have attempted to analyse
[military/[militarized]{.mark}]{.underline} contexts in a more complex
sociological manner within organization and [[management
studies]{.underline}]{.mark}. A notable example here is Locke's (1998,
pp. 145-156) comparative study of World War II Wehrmacht and Allied
Forces officer training and the lessons this offers for business school
experiences. From a more critical posture, valuable and insightful
interest has been expressed in particular geo-political periods i.e. The
Cold War (Cooke et al., 2005, 2006). Indeed, Cooke et al., vitally
alluded to the indifference of critical approaches to military
dimensions noting that in ignoring the Cold War critical management "has
[[continued to]{.mark} tacitly [represent]{.mark} itself as [developing
and existing in a completely separate realm]{.mark}]{.underline}".
Nevertheless, in spite of these critical moments, the commonly
referenced texts persist as a leitmotiv for the [phenomenon of
militarized managerialism]{.underline}. Military contexts are,
[certainly [within managerialistic commentaries]{.mark}]{.underline},
constructed in a "military + topic" manner. For example, military and
medicine (Cooter, 1999) and thereby perpetuate a modernistic
functionalist delineation of the application of military commentary.
This engenders a further dislocating effect whereby the application of
the military to a specific topic is treated as a form of "bolt on"
approach rather than a rich cultural, social or political synthesis and
appreciation -- a role to which critical approaches would be admirably
suited.

#### '[Expert studies]{.underline}' from '[prestigious universities]{.underline}' worsen the problem because those institutions [never]{.underline} oppose the military managerialist structure.

Rauchhaus favors statist explanations for the expansion, summarizing one
key argument by Charles Kupchan as follows: "One of the key players who
helped advance the policy was Anthony Lake, the national security
adviser during the first Clinton administration. Lake was also joined by
several proponents of the policy, including Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Holbrooke and, later on, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott. Although in the minority, this group of enlargement supporters
was able to overcome widespread bureaucratic opposition by encouraging
the President to issue public statements about the future of NATO and
eastern Europe." [[In reviewing]{.underline}]{.mark} these [key [figures
we see]{.mark} a [strong]{.mark} [overlap to
mainstream]{.mark}]{.underline} academic
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Lake attended
[[Harvard]{.underline}]{.mark} and did further study at
[[Princeton]{.underline}]{.mark} University's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs (which has been renamed the Princeton
School of Public and International Affairs). Holbrooke attended
[[Brown]{.underline}]{.mark} University and was later a fellow at the
Wilson School. Talbott attended [[Yale]{.underline}]{.mark} University
and [[Oxford]{.underline}]{.mark} University (when Bill Clinton was also
in residence there), and later headed the Brookings Institution
(2002-2017). To a certain extent, universities have been incubators for
war planners.

These **[[elite institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** each
[[represent]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[circulation points
for]{.underline}]{.mark} elite [[consensus]{.underline}]{.mark},
although Brown University has recently developed a Costs of War Project
which involves elements of anti-militarism. Wilson School researchers
were even linked to a Nobel Peace Prize to abolish nuclear weapons. Yet,
[**[none]{.mark}** of these institutions [are known for]{.mark}
generating [research that]{.mark}]{.underline} systematically
[[**opposes** the U.S. military]{.mark} industrial
[complex]{.mark}]{.underline}, promoting civilian conversion of defense
industries [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} any program of systemic
[[demilitarization]{.underline}]{.mark}. Opposition to nuclear war does
nothing to prevent the arms sales and interventions that trigger nuclear
expansionism. A recent review by this author of literature on economic
conversion did not identify a single scholar at such institutions (with
the exception to the rule being Seymour Melman at Columbia University
and his colleagues), probably because elite universities like Harvard
have championed a dual use approach which backs defense industrial
policy and support for military technological development. While Wilson
alumnus Ralph Nader clearly qualifies as a leading voice against
militarism and Ivy League institutions like Columbia University once
championed systemic anti-militarization, one can safely conclude that
there are no academic programs based on the core idea of anti-militarism
and demilitarization in the Ivy League universities. **[[There are no
"departments of anti-militarist studies"]{.underline}]{.mark}** anywhere
in the English-speaking world. There are various academic departments
embracing "[[Critical]{.underline}]{.mark} Security
[[Studies]{.underline}]{.mark}," but such institutions [are [not
generating]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[leadership]{.mark} [of U.S.
military]{.mark}]{.underline} and foreign policy bureaucracies. The
deconstruction of militarism does not necessarily lead to strategies
which actual hinder military managerialism. The larger point that is
most relevant has been made by Institute for Policy Studies founders
Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnet: [[Taking a hard, military line]{.mark}
has]{.underline} often [[been]{.mark} most [useful
for]{.mark}]{.underline} advancing the careers of [[fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy [bureaucrats]{.mark}]{.underline}, where advocating
peace and long-term, more peaceful measures has often been detrimental.
Raskin championed a comprehensive treaty for general and complete
disarmament and did not simply deconstruct militarism. His ideas have
not really circulated within critical security studies circles.

While some realists correctly convey the limits to NATO's Ukraine
expansion, they share with some of their left counterparts a limited
interest in discussing economic conversion of defense firms or a larger
reconstructionist program to undermine the Pentagon's capacity to
expand. These [[groups do not specify]{.mark} the design of]{.underline}
strategic [[interventions **against military
managerialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if some correctly critique
the results of such managerialism, the dependent variable. Such a
long-term policy may seem irrelevant in the face of an immediate crisis,
but can be part of a systemic mobilization and contests in key
supporting pillars of the militarist system, like universities.
Universities contain a space that combines ecological activists,
procurement power, and the ability to shift resources to support a
civilian, green economy at the expense of a military, petroleum-based
one. Universities have generated a topical, discursive space key to
antiwar activity, such as the teach-in efforts which were pivotal in the
movement against the U.S. intervention in Vietnam. An on-line discussion
is not a teach-in (in the classic sense) which requires a systemic
mobilization that influences discourse in a university. Such teach-ins
require organizing campaigns that involve diverse faculty, students and
sometimes administrators.

A campaign to delink the supporting pillars of the military can begin on
the periphery of the military procurement system in the activities of
students, peace groups, and labor unions supporting sustainable
conversion. The activities required for greening a university clearly
overlap with the activities for demilitarizing a university as both
interventions depend on expanding green civilian markets and question
the kinds of procurement actors who patronize universities.

In contrast to the state-centered discourse of realists, citizen
diplomacy offers a more coherent basis for military disengagement,
particularly when militarists dominate and organize state foreign
policy. We have a clear model for what can be done in the 1985 efforts
of Chuck Alton and Ted Turner who organized a "Global Town Meeting...a
group of Soviet citizens \[in Moscow\] had gotten up in the middle of
the night to talk with their American buddies." During this broadcast,
"thousands of other Americans were listening in and occasionally
participating from about 30 U.S. cities, which carried the live,
90-minute broadcast."

The program for systemic a campaign [[to oppose]{.underline}]{.mark}
[military [managerialism]{.mark}]{.underline} is clear. The enabling
mechanisms can start in university-based campaigns and involve Global
Town Meetings. Present institutional configurations in the Pentagon,
peace movements, and foreign policy bureaucracies are either hostile (at
worst) or not sufficient (at best) for supporting this agenda. [[Social
amnesia]{.underline}]{.mark} about what works [clearly [defines]{.mark}
the [limits of]{.mark}]{.underline} contemporary [[institutional
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Uniformed professionals have long complained of the unwanted and
counterproductive intrusion of civilian managers into the business of
war. To many observers of American wars -- especially to Vietnam
veterans -- '[[body counts]{.mark}' are [a]{.mark}]{.underline} potent
[[symbol of]{.mark} the [failures]{.mark}]{.underline}, remoteness, and
disrespect [[shown by]{.underline}]{.mark} civilian '[[war managers' as
regards]{.mark} the realities of [combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. General
Tommy Franks repeated this refrain during the Second Gulf War when he
famously claimed 'we don't do body counts'.1 But although professional
[[militaries]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[want to]{.mark}
[establish themselves as]{.mark}]{.underline} the sole shapers and
[[executors of]{.mark} warfighting [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline},
doctrine and conduct (Strachan, 2013: 83), military operations are in
reality always inseparable from broader political strategies and goals
(Bacevich, 2008; Daddis, 2014; Porch, 2013). This is arguably even more
true in the era of 'New' (Kaldor, 2012), 'asymmetric', 'hybrid' or
'irregular' wars, such as [counterinsurgencies,
[counter-]{.mark}terrorism and nation-building [operations, where
objectives]{.mark}]{.underline} and fronts [[are unclear and where war
is 'among]{.mark} the [people']{.mark}]{.underline} (Fitzgerald, 2013;
Strachan, 2013: 83--84; US Army and Marine Corps, 2007). Without
'measurements of progress' how can the political, security, cultural and
economic objectives of a counterinsurgency campaign be politically
framed, let alone met (Boettcher and Cobb, 2006)? In the US campaigns in
the Second Iraq War, in Afghanistan and in the current conflict against
Isil, [[metrics]{.mark} used [to estimate]{.mark} population
[security]{.mark} and]{.underline} the operational [readiness
of]{.underline} host country [security forces]{.underline} have [been
[endlessly created]{.mark} and discussed [as military]{.mark}
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} and civilian politicians [[develop
narratives of progress]{.underline}]{.mark} and success. Despite the
military's public disdain for [[managerial]{.mark} [measures, such as
the]{.mark}]{.underline} infamous [[Vietnam]{.mark} era '[body
count']{.mark}]{.underline}, in the messy and political business of war
the ideology and practices of managerialism have wide currency and
[cannot be so easily sepa- rated from those of
professionalism.]{.underline}

In common with many occupations, the profession of arms has an awkward
and [conflict-ridden [relationship with
'management]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}, especially when managers are
drawn from outside their own ranks. [This relationship
[deepened]{.mark}]{.underline} as [management [as]{.mark} a
[profession]{.mark}]{.underline} in its own right
[[expanded]{.underline}]{.mark} and matured [[during the Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cooke, 1999; McCann, 2015; Waring, 1991).
Hostility between professionals and management reached its apogee after
the Vietnam conflict when a widely popularized explana- tion for
stalemate and failure claimed that the US military was hemmed in by the
'self-imposed restraints' (Moyar, 2006; Sorley, 2007: 354) and
self-delusional metrics of civilian management, and was forced to fight
with 'one arm tied behind its back' (Greiner, 2010: 96). This article
explores the role of managerialism in war by discussing the
historiography of the Vietnam War and the conten- tious recent
discussions around 're-learning' counterinsurgency doctrine for the 'New
Wars' of the globalized, post--Cold War era (Fitzgerald, 2013; Nagl,
2005; Porch, 2013; Strachan, 2013). Focussing on the debates around
civilian mismanagement of the Vietnam conflict, especially as
personified by the arch-manager Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, it
argues that militarism and managerialism are closer in nature, spirit
and aim than they might first appear. Although military forces are
increas- ingly keen to distance themselves from civilian management
(Bacevich, 2008; Johnson, 2004; Strachan, 2013), the article portrays
'[[management' and]{.mark} 'the [military']{.mark}]{.underline} as
[deeply [entwined in]{.mark} their]{.underline} shared [[use of]{.mark}
[managerialist ideology]{.mark}]{.underline} (Klikauer, 2013),
manifested in [[vague and ritualized symbols]{.mark}, metrics and
'toolkits]{.underline}', and [[a]{.mark} [fixation on operational
levels]{.mark}]{.underline} [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} due [[regard
for]{.mark} the [political aims]{.mark} and purposes [of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. This situation has a remarkable persistence
into the so-called 'New Wars' of the 21st century, suggesting that
managerialist artefacts, ideologies and practices (such as body count)
remain vital components of warfare despite their practical inadequacies.
Building on emerging research into the Cold War and management (Cooke,
1999, 2006; Kelley et al., 2006; McCann, 2015; Spector, 2006), the 'dark
side' of management (Hanlon, 2015; Linstead et al., 2014) and critical
career biography (Collin and Young, 1986; Gibson et al., 2013), the
article proposes the concept of 'war managerialism', a version of
general management ideology applied to the 'killing work' or
'businesslike killing' (Greiner, 2010: 222, 221) of warfare. The article
argues that military 'failings' in Vietnam were only partially related
to the unwanted intrusion ofmanagerialist methods, such as body count
and quantitative measurement, over the professional norms of warfare.
Atrocities, strategic confusion, indiscriminate use of force, lack of
public accountability, questionable metrics and assertions of dubious
'progress' remain very much staple features of warfare, in Vietnam, the
recent counterinsurgency conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in
contemporary efforts to 'degrade' Isil (Kaldor, 2012: 179; Porch, 2013).

Military managerialism is a principle described by thinkers like C.
Wright Mills and Seymour Melman, two Columbia University professors who
were among the leading anti-militarist intellectuals in the United
States. The principle of [[military managerialism suggests that
**bureaucracies** are based on]{.mark} the **[control]{.mark}** of
greater and greater numbers of persons and places as part of what
appears to be the natural extension **system of power**]{.underline}.
Various bureaucracies, be they transnational corporations, war
contractors or the Pentagon, seek to expand their base of power. This
principle is not simply evidenced in the [**mega-mergers** producing
large transnational corporate "defense contractors]{.underline}," but
also the extension of the state military enterprise in all walks of
life, [from [militarized **policing**, to use of the military to somehow
extricate us from **ecological challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, to
feminist militarism]{.underline} where militaries are deployed to
advance "women's rights."

It is true that some women's interests were advanced by the U.S.
military engagement's support of the Taliban overthrow (as in
Afghanistan in a limited fashion according to the John R. Allen and
Vanda Felbab-Brown Brookings Institution) and that police power is
needed to remove anti-democratic elements (as in the January 6, 2021
Capitol insurgents or Canadian trucker assault on public space). The
problem, however, is that [[militarist managerialism works by
**harvesting** problems that it **creates**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
Kristina vanden Heuvel recently noted in an interview with Doug Henwood,
[NATO basically solves problems created by itself]{.underline}. To this
one might add, that [[NATO]{.mark} also tries to solve problems that it
does not create, but [creates **new versions** of the same
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In [military managerialism a host of diverse actors including the
**Pentagon**]{.underline}, allied **[militaries]{.underline}** in
Europe, war **[corporations]{.underline}** benefitting from NATO
standardization requirements, the elite mass **[media]{.underline}**,
allied [**politicians**, **think tanks** and **academics**]{.underline}
each [gain by supporting NATO expansion]{.underline}. These groups
represent the nexus of political, economic, media and academic capital
aligned with militarist interests. [Such [expansion raises the
**power**]{.mark} and **status** [of each group]{.mark} and individual
[supporting such **advocacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, those
opposing such expansion rarely if ever gain any such benefits. Through
political economies of scale, the top managers gain more markets (be
they political or economic) for their product or service. A person in a
larger organization gains more power by virtue of the extension of her
or his organization.

Militarism itself can be defined as [the [support of]{.mark} "**hard
power**" and [military solutions that displace **peaceful** economic and
**diplomatic** solutions]{.mark} or the advocacy of military
technology]{.underline}, enterprises and engagements. Militarism
advances without any countervailing concern for general and complete
(mutual) disarmament and disengagement, civilian and sustainable
economic conversion, alternative or defensive security measures, or
mechanism to build trust among adversaries and create new, alternative
budget policies such as a Green New Deal, investment in mass transit
infrastructure, or other forms of pro-active civilian engagement. Even
when military solutions seem or are necessary, as the defeat of the Nazi
regime during World War II, there was a back story about how a failed
peace encouraged military ascendancy. This failed peace could be seen in
draconian conditions imposed on Germans or through deals arms
contractors in countries like Sweden made with German military
contractors to subvert the Treaty of Versailles.

[Military [Managerialism and]{.mark}]{.underline} the

limit]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[expansion after German
unification]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Spiegel International explains,
"According to...documents, the U.S., the UK and Germany signaled to the
Kremlin that a NATO membership of countries like Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic was out of the question. In March 1991, British Prime
Minister John Major promised during a visit to Moscow that 'nothing of
the sort will happen.\'" NATO [[expansionism]{.underline}]{.mark} was
part of [[a]{.mark} military [**managerialist move** backed by **far
right** elements in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}: "The U.S. administration at the time
\[when NATO expansionism was promoted\] included influential hardliners
like Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and his neo-conservative
undersecretary of state, Paul Wolfowitz. These were men who dreamed of
developing the U.S. into the only global superpower, and saw
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily [as [a **tool** to **assert**
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} dominance in Europe. The interest shown by
countries in Eastern Europe in joining the alliance was helpful in that
regard. The Defense Department urged that NATO leave 'the door ajar.\'"

When the dust settles China (and Asia) will still be standing. Where

[cultural attitude to [mining and technology placed]{.mark} them outside
dominant cultural norms]{.underline} because of their nihilistic
cultural effects. [Nineteenth-century capitalism brought
them]{.underline}, as well as markets, in from the cold, [placing them
close [to the centre of things]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} today, now [[joined by]{.mark} the

The German philosopher Martin Heidegger2 (1977) made a famous
observation regarding the [trajectory of modern technological
society]{.underline} in his late work The Question Concerning
Technology. He noted that, rather than being simply made up of an
assemblage of physical equipment, [[modern]{.mark} forms of
[technology]{.mark} are actually a mode of 'revealing'---or interacting
with the world---which [turns our environment into]{.mark} what he
called '[standing-reserve]{.mark}]{.underline} \[Bestand\]'.
[Standing-reserve refers to the abstraction of mere [resources]{.mark}
which are quantified and assessed and [prepared for
**extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Take, for example, his distinction
between modern technology and the older technology of the windmill:

The revealing that rules in [[modern]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} is a challenging \[Herausefordern\],

energy that can be extracted and stored]{.mark} as such]{.underline}.
But does this not hold true for the old windmill as well? No. Its sails
do indeed turn in the wind; they are left entirely to the wind's
blowing. But the windmill does not unlock energy from the air currents
in order to store it.

This [[analysis]{.mark} then [continues in relation to]{.mark} [land use
and cultivation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with 'the [earth now

far as to state that '[[Everywhere everything is ordered to stand
by]{.mark}, to [be immediately at hand]{.mark}, indeed to stand there
just [so that it may be on call for a further
ordering]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}. In the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries, this process even extends to the human being
itself (which he recognised through the rise of such terms as 'human
resources'), a topic to which I will turn my attention in the next
chapter. Here, however, I wish to examine what I propose to be the
increasing conversion of the non-human and 'environment' to effective
standing-reserve, through a variety of processes increasingly actualised
under the rubric of 'sustainable development' once converted in this
manner, [[**technocratic managerialism** comes to the
fore]{.underline}]{.mark}, instantiated in various forms of eco-bean

#### Controlling the environment through '[technology]{.underline}' and '[scientific solutions]{.underline}' serve as a [domineering system]{.underline} wherein the '[conservation]{.underline}' of the environment and management of [natural resources]{.underline} serves to manipulate the world through [ecomanagerialism]{.underline}.

Coined by virginia tech political science professor Timothy Luke,
[[eco-managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} refers to a particular type of
environmental management [[carried out by
"professional]{.mark}-technical [workers]{.mark}"]{.underline} who are
**[[trained in env]{.mark}ironmental [science]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
policy schools [[at Western universities]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
emphasize "[[sound **scientific**]{.mark} and [**technical**"
solutions]{.mark} to environmental crises]{.underline}. Specifically,
Luke argues that specially trained environmental experts define their
managerial goals in [relation ecosystem "goods" and
"services,]{.underline}" which [[necessitate]{.mark} a [treatment of the
physical]{.mark}]{.underline} environment primarily [in terms of natural
resources]{.underline}. This means that [environmental
managers]{.underline}, though charged with the protection and
conservation of the physical environment, also [[**protect** the
dominant]{.mark} economic]{.underline} and political
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark} [that surround those
resources.]{.underline}

This notion of [[ecomanagerialism favors]{.mark} a]{.underline}
capitalistic [and [technocratic approach to env]{.mark}ironmental
[management]{.mark},]{.underline} where efficiency and economic
development are the primary motivations for environmental policy and
management, rather than other potential solutions to environmental
concerns, such as behavioral changes, economic restrictions, or
alternative technologies. In essence, Luke\'s idea of
[ecomanagerialism]{.underline} attempts to acknowledge and [understand
how [modern resource]{.mark} [management]{.mark}]{.underline} has cast
nature primarily as an economic and political "asset" that can only
properly be managed by technical environmental experts. The physical
environment, under a regime of ecomanagerialism, is valued far less for
its preexisting ecological processes, than its function in the modern
capitalist economy. Furthermore, the [[material]{.mark} and discursive
[practices]{.mark} of ecomanagerialism [constitute]{.mark} a form
of]{.underline} power that Luke refers to as
"[[geopower]{.underline}]{.mark}," where [[only ecomanagers are
employed]{.mark}]{.underline} for resource management and [[to solve
impending]{.mark} ecological [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requires
that the goals of environmental management employed by eco-managers are
defined in terms of modernization, where the average citizen is made to
think that he or she cannot fully understand the complexities of the
natural environment.

The basis of [[ecomanagerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} lies in the
discursive transformation of ecological processes and systems into
economic commodities or natural resources. Luke claims that this
[[occurs in]{.mark} the **modern research
[university]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here, students learn to manage,
manipulate, and control nature as "a sanding reserve, a resource supply
center, a waste reception site." This is essential for making nature and
the physical environmental legible and comprehendible to various
policy-makers and engineers, but also makes the physical world
politically relevant (in so far as it has economic and social services).
Drawing on Foucault\'s notions of discourse, power, and knowledge, Luke
claims that these eco-managers, produced by schools such as Berkeley\'s
Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management and the Yale
School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, use nature to
"[[legitimize]{.mark} many political [projects]{.mark}]{.underline}"
aimed at facilitating or sustaining capital accumulation. This is done
through the exercise of disciplinary forms of geo-power in the modern
capitalist economy held by a new class of experts, specialist,
engineers, and planners. Similarly, this practice often disguises the
role of the capitalist economy in creating the very environmental
problems ecomangers are required to solve.

Luke identifies three primary forms of eco-managerialism, including
[[**resource** managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} (where
[[ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark} services are
[[protected]{.underline}]{.mark} and supplied [[for]{.mark} economic
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}), [[**risk**
managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} (which calculates and
[[oversees]{.underline}]{.mark} the amount of [[destruction on natural
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} to sustain a minimum level of economic and
social health), and recreationist managerialism (which manages the
natural environment for recreational consumption as a resource, such as
public parks). Luke\'s critique of ecomanagerialism lies in its
assertion that only "positivistic technical knowledges" can be used as a
means to address environmental concerns. This often excludes socially
and politically based solutions to environmental concerns, which might
not necessarily accelerate and facilitate capitalist accumulation. These
practices not only obscure the complex and uneven power relations
inherent in environmental management, but also the way in which
eco-mangers inevitably reproduce themselves by reproducing the
environmental crisis they are expected to solve. [[Ecomanagerialism
is]{.mark} a [self]{.mark} [reproducing and
expanding]{.mark}]{.underline} form of modern environmental management.

#### Climate science depoliticizes climate discourse by turning complex class and ecological conflict into managerial problems solvable through techno-fixes which perverts critique into compliance.

Moore's critique of the elision of capital from the concept of the
Anthropocene is closely related to Swyngedouw's (2019) charge of the
Anthropocene as a depoliticizing,
[[techno-managerial]{.underline}]{.mark} dispositif that ultimately
[[results in]{.underline}]{.mark} a form of
"[[eco-gentrification]{.underline}]{.mark}". For Stubblefield (2018),
similarly, [the [Anthropocene]{.mark} is]{.underline} a
[flawed]{.underline} concept that [[can only offer]{.mark} "scientific
[management]{.mark}]{.underline}" and large-scale geoengineering [[as a
response to eco]{.mark}logical [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. Huber
(2022, ch. 3) sees [climate [scientists as a]{.mark}]{.underline}
"[[professional class]{.underline}]{.mark}" completely [at the service
of capital]{.underline}. At the institutional level, Selcer (2018) sees
the very idea of a global environment as constituted by functionalist
scientists and bureaucrats around the United Nations. Critique of the
Anthropocene ideology is undoubtedly necessary, but one should keep the
analytical distinction with the underlying science.14 Moore (2021)
refers to Jay Forrester of MIT's business school, who was not even a
climate scientist. Actually, the direct lineage of climate science in
terms of both content and institutional framework is represented by Jule
Charney. Centering more on the internal developments of climate science,
Weart (2008) recognizes in passing the influence of the social movements
of the 1960s, while exaggerating the role of political figures like Al
Gore (66, 90, 110, 138). This essay has shown that politics started much
before Gore's liberal environmentalism, with scientists themselves (see
also Moore 2008). Even the depoliticization of the "Anthropocene" should
not be regarded onesidedly. Paul Crutzen, one of the coiners of the
concept, for example, pioneered research on "nuclear winter" (the
disastrous consequences of a nuclear war) which was continued by Carl
Sagan and others in the US, fostering an anti-nuclear movement in the
1980s. Crutzen considered this research his most important achievement
"from a political point of view" (emphasis mine), and in this, he was a
continuator of the opposition of climate science to the
military-industrial complex (Crutzen & Birks 1982; Crutzen 1995, 218).

Nevertheless, Swyngedouw (2019) recognizes that Earth [scientists
"[overwhelmingly understand the earth as a]{.mark} complex, non-linear"
[system]{.mark} in [which human activities are part
of]{.mark}]{.underline} these "[terraforming activities]{.underline}". I
have already argued that this is the result of conflictual historical
developments that were by no means apolitical. Besides, taking the
underlying science seriously, one can argue that class is embedded into
climate science: by [[conceptualizing]{.mark} the [atmosphere as
a]{.mark} commons]{.underline}, it inherently [undermines
discourses]{.underline} and practices [that treat it as]{.underline} a
sink, private property, or [[commodity]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the fact
that the atmosphere is a commons is taken for granted now, it is a
historical result of climate science. That conceptualization, as already
shown, was made possible by the act of rejecting NATO's ambitions to
centralize the science, which resulted in the planetary commoning of
knowledge and resources (if temporarily) thereafter.15 Interestingly,
while scientists were beginning this work of conceptualization, Krahl
(2008/1971) detected a shift in the theory of class: the scientification
of production resulted in the integration of the "scientific
intelligentsia" into the working class so that the engagement of those
workers of science and technology became a requirement for class
consciousness. Later, Berardi (2009) elaborated on this while scientists
protested against the Iraq war, calling this section of the working
class involved with information technologies the "cognitariat" (a
composition of "cognition" and "proletariat"). As already seen, those
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[conceptualized the atmosphere as
a commons had]{.mark} early [experience with]{.mark}]{.underline}
computers and **[[other information systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Therefore, considering the historical constitution of GARP/IPCC through
a conflict with NATO, Selcer's contention that the global environment
was a creation of functionalist bureaucrats appears unconvincing,
especially because his case is based on the study of some UN environment
projects, but GARP, the major global research program that informed
climate science, instituted by a UN resolution, is not discussed. By the
same token, having in mind the conceptualization of the atmosphere as a
commons, Huber's reduction of scientists to a "professional class"
completely subsumed by capital looks one-sided. Certain [[forms of the
Anthropocene and related]{.mark} [discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} better [[be seen as an attempt to
contain]{.underline}]{.mark} the critical [[content]{.underline}]{.mark}
embedded [in]{.underline} climate [science]{.underline} [[by]{.mark}
[channeling it]{.mark} back [to]{.mark}]{.underline} capitalist forms
([[managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, carbon markets, and the like). If
climate science is an outcome of the revolution of 1968, its "taming" is
a project of the neoliberal counterrevolution. It is not by chance that
capitalist corporations and the State financed disinformation campaigns,
established conservative "think tanks" and even submitted climate
scientists to censorship (Conner 2022, 79-83; Weart 2008, 110).
According to Weart (2008), the institutional framework of the IPCC put
reporting under the control of governments because the US (the Reagan
administration) distrusted independent scientists, who could make
"radical environmental pronouncements" (152-3). All this, however, only
attests to the critical content of climate science.

the Fundão Dam collapse in Brazil, the Doce River basin catastrophe, and

portray [the grim reality of]{.mark} the [prevailing]{.mark}
[managerial]{.mark} [regimes]{.mark} in action (e.g., Kuldova and
Nordric, 2023; Matos et al., 2022; Rotta et al., 2020).]{.underline}
[[These]{.mark} happenings [urge]{.mark} [us]{.mark} [to
consider]{.mark} the **[environmental impact]{.mark}** of businesses
**[beyond managerial mishaps]{.mark}**, to **[challenge]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} dominant [epistemic]{.mark} [regimes]{.mark} circulating

education [beyond profits]{.mark}.]{.underline} [We believe [thinking
along]{.mark} [these lines **involves a commitment to finding different

**[who can shift the responsibility]{.mark}** and the 'locus of

ideate, articulate and [implement]{.mark} [nature-preserving]{.mark}
sustainable [practices]{.mark} throughout their business and stakeholder
networks (e.g., Serafeim, 2022). We invite articles in the special issue
which underscore the **[critical role of business schools]{.mark} [in
driving epistemic change]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [transforming managerial
thought by embodying a duty of care towards their natural
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Adler, 2002; Ferlie et al., 2010;
Gill, 2020; Vos and Page, 2020). Articles will look to advance theory by
[[rethinking]{.mark} prevailing [epistemic]{.mark} [regimes]{.mark} [to
find alternatives to tackle neoliberal logics, rationality, and the
profit-driven psyche of managers]{.mark}, which questionably
**[directs]{.mark} [sustainability]{.mark} [efforts]{.mark} of the

(Augustine et al., 2019; Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010; Luan et al.,

businesses to re-evaluate their practices, lead emphatic change, and
prioritise ecological well-being]{.underline} (see Heuer, 2012; Nyberg
et al., 2018; Wright and Nyberg, 2015). Through this special issue, [[we
call for a radical response]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [managerial]{.mark}
knowledge **[crisis]{.mark}** [that **prioritises capital gains** over
value]{.mark} creation [through]{.mark} environmental

the very [existence]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the

will require new approaches to study business school curricula,
pedagogies, and practices across economic, cultural, social, and
political contexts (Capano, 2020; Kauko and Wermke, 2018; Scherer and

[[Liberating]{.mark} the [managerial]{.mark} [episteme]{.mark}

[[Managerialist]{.mark} [regimes]{.mark} prioritising [capital gains are

can [embrace this]{.mark} duality [and]{.mark} [challenge]{.mark} the

Kaul and Luo, 2018; Nyberg and Murray, 2023; Wright and Nyberg, 2015). A
key feature of epistemic change is reflective practice (see Hibbert et
al., 2022; Raelin, 2007) and the ability to become critical of the
conventional managerialist ideologies which prioritize profitability.
[We encourage contributors to explore pathways to bring about such
epistemic change in business schools by disentangling climate change
from capitalist discourses]{.underline} (see Wittneben et al., 2012).
[These pathways can identify theoretical nuances for embedding
eco-thinking as business schools look to cultivate a new generation of
managers equipped to navigate the complexities of the climate crisis
while upholding ethical and environmentally sustainable
values]{.underline}. Contributors can draw upon multiple perspectives,
variety of methodologies and methods, inter/trans-disciplinary
approaches, and philosophical paradigms in the (de-)construction of
prevalent managerialist epistemologies (e.g., Capano, 2020; Kauko and
Wermke, 2018[). [We]{.mark} [believe]{.mark} **[there is scope]{.mark}**
for business schools **[to learn]{.mark}** also **[from

[In the [Arctic]{.mark}, interest in the [notion of sustainable
development]{.mark} emerged in the 1980s]{.underline} in parallel with
and partly [in response to the global discourses on how to reconcile
economic and social development with environmental
protection]{.underline} \[25\]. As global change research developed,
scientific practices also came under scrutiny, [[lead]{.mark}ing [to
calls for "sustainability science" with]{.mark} more interdisciplinary
approaches and an [emphasis on]{.mark} addressing [societal
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} e.g., \[26\]. Its further
development included attention to system dynamics in resilience
thinking, with focus on the capacity of social-ecological systems to
cope with and recover from disturbances and more recently developed with
added attention to people's capacity to learn in order to adapt to
change or deliberately try to transform the system \[27--30\]. [Partly
linked to the focus on learning as a key social aspect of
social-ecological systems, sustainability science has come to include a
stronger focus on processes for arriving at new development pathways,
[including an emphasis on co-production of
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} \[25,31\]. [[Arctic research features a
growing body of work based on]{.mark} local case studies where
**[co-production of knowledge with communities]{.mark}** has been
central.]{.underline} While the exploratory assessment of the global
SDGs featured in this article is a research-driven effort, our analysis
builds on empirical work that is guided by norms from sustainability
science, including engagement with various stakeholders to co-produce
knowledge. As we return to this in the Discussion, we foresee a need for
further strengthening of such local engagement. However, given that
localities across the world are connected to global processes that both
affect and are affected by local activities, there is also a need to
create participatory processes in which the global-local links can be
explicitly explored \[24\]. The global SDG framework could serve as one
starting point for such processes, but only if it is perceived as
relevant or can be made relevant for learning processes at the
subnational and local levels.

The legitimacy of the SDG framework cannot be taken for granted. One
[concern is that [various actors have used the plasticity of]{.mark} the
concept of [sustainable development to forward their own]{.mark}
specific [perspective]{.mark}, [not seldom with national
interests]{.mark} in mind, as [shown in]{.mark} studies of [Arctic
sustainability discourses]{.mark}]{.underline} \[32\]. A second concern
relates to the fact that [the function of [indicators]{.mark} reaches
far beyond informing policy and they **[become tools of governability
and managerialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[33\]. Lehtonen et al. argue
that instead of focusing on the instrumental functions of indicators (as
guides for better decision making), more attention should be placed on
"the political framework conditions shaping and being shaped by
indicators" \[33\]. [While [recogniz]{.mark}ing the inherent limitations
of indicators and the **criticism of [indicators as tools of
managerialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [we consider it timely [to
scrutinize]{.mark} the SDG framework from an Arctic
perspective]{.underline}, given that the global SDG framework is likely
to figure in assessing development with potential implications of
various policy decisions. However, it is an important argument for an
increasing focus on process and co-production of knowledge in the
further work on Arctic SDGs.

[[Managerialism and]{.mark} modern [tech]{.mark}nology [are closely
connected]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not merely because
[[managerialism arises **in conjunction** with]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark}]{.underline} of accounting, actuarial and audit
practices in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, nor even because of
its frequent deployment of modern systems of surveillance, measurement
and control (though both are important points of connection). Rather,
[managerialism has to be understood as itself a part of modern
technological ordering]{.underline}, as belonging essentially to it and
as unthinkable without it. Indeed, one might even go so far as to say
that not only is managerialism a part of modern technology, part of a
technological system, but that in its modern form,
[[technology]{.underline}]{.mark}, or perhaps we should say,
technologism, **[[is itself managerial]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Understanding how this might be so, however, requires understanding
something of the distinctive character of both managerialism and modern
technology.

It might be said, of course, that neither managerialism nor technology
can be treated of in general, and that there is no single phenomenon
that is 'managerialism' or 'technology' -- merely different types of
managerialism and many different technologies. This seems a rather
complacent response, however, that involves turning one's eyes away from
the [self-evident [commonalities]{.mark} that [unite]{.mark} many
[different forms of]{.mark} contemporary [managerialism]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} many different [technologies]{.mark} as indeed instances of
the managerial and of the technological]{.underline}. It is also to turn
one's eyes away from the, perhaps surprising, degree of convergence
among what might otherwise be thought of as indeed different phenomena
(phenomena that are both very much determining and pervasively present
elements of our contemporary situation). This chapter is both a response
to the fact of such convergence, and to convergence as a phenomenon in
its own right, and an attempt to arrive at some critical grasp of it. My
aim here is to sketch out a framework that allows a synoptic view of the
[[contemporary managerial-technological landscape]{.underline}]{.mark}
([a landscape that [is deeply embedded in]{.mark} the structure of
contemporary [capitalism]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} so is also [fundamentally
economic]{.mark} or economistic]{.underline}), and, while it does not
offer any immediate solution to the ills to which contemporary
managerialism gives rise, it nonetheless aims to provide some insight
into its essential character. The first task, however, is to understand
the character of management, and then also the difference between
management and managerialism -- since the two cannot be simply
identified, and in some respects the latter can even be seen as
antithetical to the former.

#### This discourse of "development" is rooted in colonial and capitalist ideology---appeals to it will only reinscribe its ideological baggage. Only the alternative can solve.

[[A critique of development]{.underline}]{.mark}, however modest, is
expected today to reject the word "development". The introduction to the
first edition of the influential The Development Dictionary (1992) opens
with a startling declaration: "The last 40 years can be called the age
of development. This epoch is coming to an end. The time is ripe to
write its obituary" (2010: xv). Postdevelopment [rejects "development"
[for being a moralized, seductive discourse of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. We must not forget to underline that
"development" is rejected on account of its historical manifestation
within a particular discursive arena, originating with the Truman
doctrine. The credence to this view does have a strong Heideggerian
backing: Being is housed in the precinct of language. Outside our
discursive constructions what are meaningful realities? They are mute,
unmeaning things. With no human being to engage with things, with none
to take issue with them, without something mattering to the human being,
the possibility of meaning and the meaningful reality of a thing are
simply non-existent. The claim is not that things do not exist outside
human consciousness; the claim is that outside human care for Being,
beings do not come forth in their Being. And hence,
["[development]{.mark}" [is **nothing**]{.mark} **really [outside the
discursive space]{.mark}** [that lets it be]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, the line of argument I developed in the second chapter about
historicizing the notion of development acknowledges that outside the
historical trajectory, our realities, especially if they are social and
political phenomena, are not meaningful in any significant sense. If so,
what is the meaning of the claim in this study about the "sense" of
development?

The "[[sense of development]{.underline}]{.mark}" that I am looking for
[[comes close to]{.underline}]{.mark} the Heideggerian notion of the
"[ecstatic projection of possibilities]{.underline}". I want to argue
that the sense of dynamism in the word "development" has a
phenomenological truth to tell about being human.

We live each of our waking moments by way of projecting possibilities of
our past background of meaning, insignificant as well as crucial ones,
made significant in terms of the temporal sense of the future, defined
by the abyssal and utterly finite point of death. [[Existential
projection of possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark} is wedded to the
available possibilities of the historical context of significance.
Whenever possibilities are actualized in a present, the significance of
the available and past possibilities arises out of the future. On rare
occasions in our everyday life, we do tend to specifically own up a
possibility in reference to our own selfhood (authentic existence), but
most of the [time [we follow a mechanical,]{.mark} [socially levelled
manner of projecting possibilities]{.mark} (**[inauthentic
existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}). A sense of dynamic movement concealed
in existence as such rather than in a divinely, materially or culturally
given self-thing is a point of emphasis in existential phenomenologies
of all variety. Heidegger explains the end in death as determining all
human existential projections:

As long as Dasein is there is in every case something still outstanding,
which Dasein can be and will be. But to that which is thus outstanding,
the 'end' itself belongs. The 'end' of Being-in-the-world is death. This
end, which belongs to the potentiality-for-Being--- that is to say, to
existence---limits and determines in every case whatever totality is
possible for Dasein (BT: 276--277).

But the background that gives clarity to human choices is not only
finitude but also the cultural and dialogical context of being human.
"Development" may be reconsidered in the light of the context-sensitive
existential dynamism home to the human condition as we know it today.1

However, Heidegger's ontological characterization cannot be considered
in any way close to or replaceable with the sense of development evinced
by post-war developmentalism. That is, I am not suggesting at all that
the human being is first of all something like the developmental
individual of the post-war development discourse out there to be saved
by the modern market society. The postdevelopment writers reject the
term "development" on account of this very reason. [In [order to be free
of the allusions]{.mark} and significations of an entrenched discursive
space]{.underline} close to one's discursive concerns, postdevelopment
writers advocate that one ought to reject the significant labels
associated with that discursive space. Hence, one ought to overcome
completely the term "development" and all its allusions and so one ought
to fight it to see its defeat. [They insist that on[e should not try to
resuscitate]{.mark} such [terms]{.mark},]{.underline} pregnant with
historical meaning, in any manner, for such attempts are bound to fail;
they will forever draw us like a magnet to their entrenched
significations. Resuscitation of terms cannot be innocent and free of
the term's historical genesis, affiliations and resources.

[[The "sense" of development]{.underline}]{.mark} I am getting at is
much more basic and fundamental than the development of
developmentalism, although this "sense", in Heidegger's terms, [[is
still "ontic]{.mark}".]{.underline} What I mean is: [something like
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}, a desirous dynamism with regard to
new possibilities---call it a qualitatively better and a more human
possibility than the present and the actual one---[[animates the human
condition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Heidegger remarks: "Ontologically,
wishing presupposes care" (BT: 240). Similarly, ["[development]{.mark}"
in the above sense [presupposes the existential structure of
projection]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} to that extent [it is
ontic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Fueled by the financial crisis and growing expenses for the welfare
state, the [[public sector in Wes]{.mark}tern]{.underline}
[societies]{.underline} has [been]{.underline} the [[target for]{.mark}
extensive public [management reforms]{.mark}]{.underline} since the
1980s (Cohen et al., 1999; Hood, 1991; Pollitt, 1990). The claimed
ambition of these reforms has been to reduce government costs and to
improve quality (Hood & Dixon, 2015). They embody the NPM movement and
involve a bundle of major changes, including
[[privatization]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[contracting]{.underline}]{.mark} out, [[marketization of
services]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[inside]{.mark} [the public
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[stronger]{.mark}
performance]{.underline} management and
[[manageralization]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hood, 1991; Pollitt, 2016).

Diefenbach points out that the NPM reform movement has been both radical
and total in its scope and intensity since being introduced into all
public service sectors (Diefenbach, 2009, cf. Kirkpatrick et al., 2005).
The core idea has been that [[business practices and market]{.mark}
[orientation]{.mark}]{.underline} can [[improve]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[performance of]{.mark} public [organizations]{.mark}]{.underline},
which is referred to as [new managerialism]{.underline} (Diefenbach,
2009; Kirkpatrick et al., 2005). Characteristics of "[[new
managerialism" include changing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark} [[from rules to]{.mark}
[results]{.mark}]{.underline} and emphasizing the primacy of management
above all other activities (Frederickson, 2005). Hence, "[new
managerialism]{.underline}" is [associated with]{.underline} new kinds
of imposed [external [accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the
widespread use of [[performance indicators]{.underline}]{.mark} and
league tables, target setting, [[benchmarking]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
performance [[management]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kirkpatrick & Lucio,
1995; Power, 1999). In theory, comprehensively measuring and monitoring
crucial aspects of organizational and individual performance is thought
to lead to increased efficiency, productivity, quality, and higher
performance, and motivation. Because of explicit targets, performance
indicators, measurement, and control systems, management can be grounded
in "facts" and have a rational basis (Diefenbach, 2009; Power, 1999).
[[More "objective]{.mark}" [measures]{.mark} of an organization's
performance]{.underline} will also further [[allow]{.underline}]{.mark}
for greater [[transparency]{.underline}]{.mark} and accountability.

The shift from central regulation and detailed instructions to
decentralization, market solutions, and ex-post controls has increased
the demand for oversight and inspection of the public sector to such an
extent that Power (1999) claimed we were facing an "audit society."
Power argues that [making organizations auditable leads to]{.underline}
the [measurability]{.underline} [of activities becoming more
important]{.underline} than the actual activities carried out in the
organizations. This leads to lower levels of efficiency,
deprofessionalization and mistrust, and resistance among public
employees (Bevan & Hood, 2006; Pentland, 2000; Power, 1999). Yet
extensive procedures for (managerial) quality control not only curb
professional autonomy but also tend to increase overhead costs (Hood &
Peters, 2004). One reason is that top management tends to expand support
functions and systems for management control, which in itself
restructures the balance between core activities and support functions
within an organization (Ahlbäck Öberg & Bringselius, 2015; Boyne &
Meier, 2013). Thus, empirical studies display widespread evidence for
swelling tides of bureaucracy because of new NPM structures and
processes (Hall, 2012; Hood & Dixon, 2015; Kirkpatrick et al., 2005).
Yet, in spite of these extensive critiques by both academics and
practitioners, the seemingly dysfunctional and value-subverting
practices of accounting and auditing persist and continue to expand
(Power, 2019; Pollitt, 2016). It could, however, be added that benefits
from NPM reforms and principles such as transparency--for example,
through increased audit systems--have also been identified, but the
success depends on the administrative, political, and policy context in
which reforms take place (Lapuente & Van de Walle, 2020; Peters &
Pierre, 2020).

In many European states, [[central elements]{.mark} of]{.underline} the
penetration of NPM have been the introduction of performance
[management]{.underline} and the escalation of public policy evaluation
and audit. Power (1999) notes that the audit trail, as a process, not
only produces auditable accounts but is also a logic that is formative
of organizational actors' dispositions to reproduce those accounts. A
fair assumption [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} that these reforms also have had an impact on
[[the structuring of the civil--militar]{.mark}y relationship [within a
state]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[In modern times, [the world-making narrative of human
ascendancy]{.mark} and nonhuman demotion [was secured in collective
consciousness]{.mark} by being submerged [into concepts that directly
emerged out of the **inherited worldview that the natural world is
beneath and for humans**]{.mark}. The most overarching of modern-age
anthropocentric concepts is that of natural resources]{.underline},
[which linguistically crystallized the]{.underline} post-Cartesian
secular [[view of nature as purely material , mechanical , and **lacking
inherent purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} . 4 In the classical and
Christian eras, Western thought championed the belief that animals ,
plants , minerals , and \"savages\" existed , or were created by God ,
for human use . This doctrine laid the sturdy foundation for the
modern-secular concept of resources to emerge : [[Nature]{.mark} as a
whole [became a **domain**]{.mark} **[for human use]{.mark}** and
advancement]{.underline} . Indeed , the very category of \"nature\"
co-emerged with its construction as precisely such a domain . 5

[[The concept of resources not only foregrounds instrumentalism the lens
of viewing things as useable and profitable]{.mark}-but being general ,
content-less , and spiritless , it [enables]{.mark} instrumentalism [to
engulf]{.mark} the entire [reality]{.mark} field]{.underline} .
[[Resources is a label]{.underline}]{.mark} that can be foisted on
anything : soil, water , animals , minerals , rivers , forests ,
grasslands , and even extraterrestrial territories like the moon and
other planetary bodies . [It [casts a blanket of inertness]{.mark} or
gross materiality [over the]{.mark} substance of the [world]{.mark} ,
[whose aliveness]{.mark} and self-integrity [are denied]{.mark} or
shunted into irrelevancy . [This]{.mark} master **[concept legitimates
taking and using]{.mark}** , because [it describes the world in
ways]{.mark} precisely [intended to invite taking and using]{.mark}
.]{.underline} The instrumental reasoning and justification for
domination inherent in \"natural resources\" attained altogether new
heights through the industrial subjugation of soil, land , seas, animals
, plants , and biomes by means of technologies invented and implemented
without ethics. The amoral modality of industrial technology maps onto
the concept of resources-for \"resources\" are constituted as lacking
inherent standing . [[Amoral tech]{.mark}nology conforms to, as well as
[reinforces]{.mark} , [the idea of natural resources]{.mark} because
setting upon the world in accordance with that idea concretizes [and
legitimates it]{.mark}. [People can thus countenance]{.mark} battery
chickens , lopped-off mountains , endless monocultures , and [industrial
fishnets bursting with fish not as crimes against nature , but as the
way things are]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The pervasive and customary use of \"natural resources\" makes it
appear a normal way of talking about the world , as a language
containing no agenda]{.underline}. It is worth scrutinizing what kind of
relationship to the biosphere this ostensibly neutral concept fosters.
The term \"resources ,\" simply put , designates the world in terms of
its disposability for human needs , wants , and desires. \"Natural
resources ,\" while seemingly an objective referent to (nonliving and
living) entities , tacitly reconfigures the natural world as human owned
. The concept entirely bypasses , and via its ceaseless use ends up
erasing , the natural world\'s intrinsic standing . Indeed , the concept
of resources preempts human thought from even moving in the direction of
understanding nonhuman nature in terms of its intrinsic being .
\"Resources \" prefigures and justifies the assault on the natural world
. Nonstop exploitation is thus codependent with the omnipresent idea of
natural resources-an idea that is beholden to , and a subterraneous
continuation of, the historical legacy that nature\'s very purpose is to
serve humanity . The transfiguration of nature into resources shapes
human thought and action at such an all-encompassing level that people
end up perceiving the biosphere through this single framework. An
alternative way of relating with the nonhuman realm and another way of
seeing it become erased or profoundly attenuated .

Nature\'s configuration as resources is a supremacy-laden concept with
the power to abet anything-decapitating mountains , stripmining
seafloors , damming rivers , fracking land and seabed , building roads
wherever , or piling domestic animals into neon-lit , sickening
facilities and stuffing them with unnatural foods and substances .
Liquidating others , be they places or beings , is built into the
concept of resources and operationalized in practice . Resources is an
umbrella concept that provides a readymade , unassailable rationale for
appropriating even that which has yet to be taken . For example , a
panoply of technologies , planned actions , and legal arrangements are
in place to seize the apple-sized polymetallic (or manganese) nodules ,
which exist , in apparently great numbers , on the ocean\'s floor. These
\"resources\" contain manganese , nickel , copper , and other valuables:
the only reason they have not yet been mined on a big scale is that they
are not low-hanging fruit-they are hard to access and their lucrative
contents require much processing to extract. Mining the nodules ,
however , remains one more catastrophe to add to the other catastrophes
visited on the ocean . What makes it expectable and normal is that (lo
and behold) polymetallic nodules have already been gifted to humanity by
means of the concept of resources , which frames not only what has
hitherto been grasped but anything that is graspable. 6

A diverse world infinite in beauty , mystery , interdependencies , sheer
being , past heritage , and future evolution-a world irreducibly
wondrous as a matter-of-fact-is redefined and dissipated into
just-beingfor-using. Such is the upshot of natural resources , a concept
that has its moorings in the human privileging and nonhuman
disenfranchising that the Great Chain of Being guaranteed .

[[The devastation of the ocean]{.mark} , for example , [is a]{.mark}
direct [corollary of conceptualizing wild fish as a resource for
harvesting]{.mark}]{.underline} . [The anthropocentric worldview
[**reclassifies fish as resources by calling them \"fisheries\" and
\"fish stock** ,\"]{.mark} concepts that get the living beings
themselves out of the way and render them instead as protoplasmic
substance for mass consumption]{.underline} . 7 As author Ted Danson
points out , [the fishing industry tracks down its resource with the
exact same mindset that the oil industry tracks down its
resource-\"pushing on in the same fashion , driving their boats farther
out into . . . the deepest waters on Earth]{.underline} ,\"8
continuously moving to new grounds and eventually other species , when
\"fisheries\" and \"fish stocks\" run dry . [Linguistic [categories such
as fisheries , fish stocks , and marine resources **do not refer to real
ontological entities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are fish and other
living creatures in the ocean-there was a huge abundance of them before
industrial fishing decimated them . Human-possessive monikers pretend to
refer to something in the world , while slipping in a confabulated
representation that enables , as merely conventional , colossal
extermination acts .

[By the time a person learns the words \"fisheries\" and \"fish stock
,\" she is already fully versed in the human-supremacist worldview ; she
receives an additional confirmation. \"[Fisheries\" and \"fish stock\"
embed possessiveness-the thing already grasped-without the
grasping]{.mark} , as such , ever crossing the threshold into
self-conscious awareness]{.underline}. The violence this promises to
fish and other marine life has been delivered in spades and continues
briskly , yet is concealed from awareness because [[these]{.mark}
resource-laden [terms inform that fish are for mass consumption and that
harvesting them for that purpose is in line with nature\'s
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. In tune with this construction rides the
convenient fiction that fish are mindless beings (a kind of animated
protein) , who are not subjects of their lives, do not experience
pleasure or suffering , and cannot feel pain . This is how linguistic
constructs and beliefs participate in upholding human supremacy and
concealing its mass violence against sentient beings-right in the open.

[[Similar reasoning applies to \"fisheries collapse]{.mark} ,\" an event
that has befallen species after species. [Such collapses are rarely
comprehended as a problem for the fish]{.mark} or for the biosphere or
for the living ecologies the fish inhabit . [Somehow , the
disaster]{.mark} of \"fisheries collapse ,\" visited by modern humans
most especially , [does not befall the beings
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}-the herring , the groupers , the alewife
, the tuna , the marlin , the swordfish , the totoaba , the sea bass,
the haddock , the cod , the abalone , and so forth-**[[the disaster is
regarded as befalling people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Herein lies the
twisted genius of human supremacy , which accomplishes much of its work
backstage , by means of \"[language surrendering itself to our mere
willing and trafficking as an instrument of domination over
beings]{.underline} .\"9

#### Turns case\-\--technological development leads to more violence and nuclearization

[Nation-[states can be]{.mark} seen as [the most gigantic and organized
machine for]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nological reduction of beings to
their usability]{.underline}. Nationalism is humanism's political
expression. Like religion for the pre-moderns, the political state is
the organizational structure of life for the moderns. Driven by
enframing, humans do not become individuals in a vacuum but in
territorially specific, emotionally bound nation-states. [[The
liberation of the human being]{.mark} from the supersensible order in
modern times [led]{.mark} her [to **technologically aided**]{.mark}
"[conquest and **domination** of the world]{.mark}"]{.underline} and
positioned her at its centre. The new order detached her from the
original order of organically grown nature and natural community and
placed her in definitive affinity with the mechanical understanding of
nature and the new social order. According to Heidegger, the new social
order "receives the character of society, that is, of an association.
Here is the origin of the new concept of the State (social contract)"
(2009: 119). Rising up as a nation and becoming a state is, thus,
humanization itself, which is a way of making phenomena available and
reserved for the sake of the human being, and without the total
organization of the modern nation-state, this reduction would have been
impossible.

Development of nations, as the organized concretion of the hidden
essence of technology, is overtly and covertly warlike in its unfolding.
A nation on the developmental path is either forthrightly combative or
allies with forces big enough for war. [[Development as
modernization]{.mark} reveals itself primarily as [expand]{.mark}ing the
[power]{.mark}, both economic and political, [and influence]{.mark} of
the nation undergoing it [outside its borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
doing so, it entices other nations to undertake modernization primarily
in self-defence before its other possibilities dawn on them.
[[Militarization]{.mark} and determining the militarization of
non-militarized zones [have been modernization]{.mark} at its

[[development as modernization]{.underline}]{.mark} was always set in
motion by the intrusion of a foreign power in a nation's affairs; it did
not originate from a desire to improve the quality of life of people,
but from a sense of "reactive nationalism" [[and wanting to
increase]{.mark} national [power]{.mark}]{.underline} (Arndt 1987: 13).4
[The hidden warlike [essence of technoscientific rationality]{.mark}
[that drives]{.mark} modern culture, discloses [development as
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rabindranath Tagore was a well-known enemy
of warlike nationalism as the epigraph to this chapter says. In his 1917
lecture, Nationalism, Tagore criticized the [nation-machine as a
consequence of the long Western intellectual history of privileging the
"gigantic abstractions of efficiency" and cultivating the professional
human being to the detriment of the personal]{.underline} (1996, Vol. 2:
430).

For sure, Heidegger is speaking about the ontological understanding that
gives rise to the violent ethos of late modernity rather than any
particular instance of modern violence and war. His thesis is the
ontological violence of reductive technological understanding, but his
eyes were not closed to how [[this violent ontology concretized
itself]{.mark} ontically [in terms of]{.mark} the [destruction
of]{.mark} the [earth]{.mark}, [tech]{.mark}nological
[transformation]{.mark} of the human animal [and]{.mark} the terrible
[devastation]{.mark} brought about [by the **atom
bomb**]{.mark}]{.underline}. His remark that the atom bomb is less
deadly as a particular apparatus of death than it is as the sign of the
death of human essence since long propelled by "the absoluteness of his
sheer willing in the sense of his deliberate self-assertion in
everything" (WP: 221), culminating in Nietzsche's metaphysics of the
will-to-power, is also to be seen in ontological light. But, in our
study of the planetary dispersal and [[concretion of the essence of
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the willing national acceptation and
the coercive-persuasive international dissemination of the historical
[form]{.mark} of technological ethos in the name of development in
essentially but subtly [violent ways throughout the global
south]{.mark}]{.underline} is of prime concern. And so, it is to be
affirmed unequivocally that the entrenchment of the violent essence of
technological understanding in modern culture is reflected not only in
the devastation of the earth through technological means but also in the
increasing incidence of violence against humanity, especially powerless
humanity.

What do we, then, make of Kant's influential opinion that democracies
will usually be shy of war? Empirical evidence seems to suggest that
"[there have been no significant differences between democratic or
non-democratic states in terms of the proportional frequency of their
war involvement or the severity of their wars]{.underline}" (Levy 1988:
661). Moreover, [[democracies]{.mark} have the tendency to [look
**selfrighteously at conflicts of interest as moral crusades** aimed at
complete victory and propagate]{.mark} "[their]{.mark} own [vision of
the morally proper international order]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Levy 1988:
659). John Ulric Nef's post-war study, War and Human Progress (1950),
argued that the new regulative ideals for societal transformation,
efficiency and abundance, which replaced the transcendental values of
the Christian civilization, was the underlying reason for the
militaristic environment of his times (Nef 1950). In the next year,
Herbert Marcuse published a largely positive review of Nef's book
without concealing his surprise at Nef's benevolent view of the
Christian civilization. Marcuse agreed that Nef could show "how the very
same process which created the preconditions for a civilization without
scarcity and repression came to refine and perpetuate---eventually by
total war---scarcity and repression" (1951: 98). That is, in the pursuit
of "ever more quantitative production of commodities under the incentive
of profit and toward ever greater efficiency" the industrial society
lost sight of all other goals but the goal of transforming "man as well
as nature into efficient and exploitable material" (Marcuse 1951:
98--99). [The [glorification of military]{.mark} service as the noblest
mission of the citizen and nationalism as the new religion, in effect,
[paid homage to the essence of technology]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[While the [overtly combative]{.mark} angle of [modernization is
problematic]{.mark}, the warlike ethos it creates covertly in the whole
political spectrum is even more troubling.]{.underline} The sense of
inevitability about war cultivated in political rhetoric, carefully
couched in reason, necessity, morals, urgency, and the eschatology of
peace brought about by war alone, has made war a virtue. The fact of war
is unimportant; war in fact may not be waged at all on the frontline.
What peace-by-war aims to create inevitably gets created: [gigantic
military buildup, jubilant battle-readiness, fear of the unknown,
polarization of the allies and the enemy-other, and creation of the
weapons market]{.underline}. The unholy alliance between war and
development is reflected in the dubious relationship that exists between
market and war. Heidegger calls war and peace "the two sticks that
savages rub together to make fire", and finds something disjointed in
the logic of war securing peace and peace eliminating war. "How is peace
to be secured by what it eliminates?" he asks. "Against this
war-peace\...", he observes, "we launch a peace offensive whose attacks
can hardly be called peaceful" (WCT: 83). President Kennedy's inimitable
utterance on the peace-by-war dialectic in 1961 is well-known: "only
when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt
that they will never be employed" (2010: 328)

### Impact---war/terrorism---2NC

#### The link alone turns case---viewing the world and people as standing reserve is the root cause of war and terrorism.

**Mitchell 5**

(Andrew J. Mitchell- -- Philosophy Fellow, Stanford and Research in
Phenomenology. Pittsburgh , Vol.35 pg. 181 , Proquest, "HEIDEGGER AND
TERRORISM", 2005)

[[With everything]{.mark} available [as standing-reserve]{.mark}, troops
included, the exhaustion of resources is no longer
possible.]{.underline} Resources are precisely in themselves
replaceable, to the extent that, in being given over to replacement,
even the idea of an \"in itself\" is already drained of reality ahead of
time. There are no longer any \"losses\" that cannot be replaced. In
other words, there is no longer any friction. All uncertainty is lost,
since it is not recognized in the first place. [Everything is monitored
and controlled. The whole \"battle\" is given over to a planning that is
able to incorporate everything it encounters, since it only ever
encounters what is already planable in essence, the
standing-reserve]{.underline}. Strategy\'s demise is the ascendancy of
planning. What this means is that [**[war can now go on
interminably]{.underline}**,]{.mark} subject to no other logic or
obligation than its own. Nothing can resist it. But without resistance,
war must end. Peace can now go on interminably as well, subject to no
other logic or obligation than its own. The logic in question for both
war and peace is the logic of replacement, the obligation for each is
the obligation to consume. There is no law that would supervene or
subtend consumption; there is no order outside of it that could contain
it. Clausewitz\'s ideal is realized in a manner that collapses the very
distinctions that gave it birth. \"War\" is no longer a duel; it
recognizes no authority outside of itself. The [name for this new
amalgam of war and peace is terrorism]{.underline}. Terrorism is
Clausewitz\'s absolute war in the mirror of technology. **[[War and
peace come to complete agreement and lose their oppositional
identity]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the age of value and the ersatz.
Without concern for resources, consumption continues untroubled, since
war is a kind of \"consumption of beings\" no different from peace:
\"War no longer batties against a state of peace, rather it newly
establishes the essence of peace\" (GA 69: 180). [[The essence of peace
so established is a peace that defines itself in regards to war]{.mark},
which binds itself inseparably to war, and which functions equivalently
to war. In cither case, [it is simply a matter of **resource consumption
and replenishment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In Clausewitzian terms,
there is perhaps too much continuity or \"continuation\" between war and
peace, \"War has become a distortion of the consumption of beings which
is continued in peace\" (GA 7: 89/EP, 104). The peace that technology
brings is nothing restful; instead it is the peace of unhindered
circulation. We cannot even ask when there will be peace or when the war
will end. Such a question, Heidegger specifies, cannot be answered,
\"not because the length of the war cannot be foreseen, but because the
question itself asks for something which no longer is, since already
there is no longer a war that would be able to come to a peace\" (GA 7:
89/EP, 104; tm). The basic oppositions of Clausewitzian warfare are
undone at this point, an undoing that includes the distinction between
ideal and real. [It also includes the distinction between soldier and
civilian.]{.underline} Since such distinctions depend upon a difference
between war and peace, they too can no longer apply. [Everyone is now a
civilian-soldier]{.underline}, or neither a civilian nor a soldier-a
\"worker,\" one might say, [or otherwise put, a target. [With everyone
involved in the same processes of consumption and delivery, everyone is
already enlisted]{.mark} in advance]{.underline}. There are no longer
any \"innocent\" victims or bystanders in this, and the same holds true
of terrorism. Terrorism is not the use of warfare against civilians
(pace Carr), for the simple reason that there no longer are any
civilians.14 It is equally not war against soldiers, and for this reason
we go wrong to even consider it war. Terrorism is the only conflict
available and the only conflict that is in essence available and
applicable. It can have everything as its target. **[[Terrorism follows
from the transformation in beings indicative of the technological age.
This transformation remains important]{.mark} at each point of a
Heideggerian thinking of terrorism [and is the ultimate consequence of
the abolition of war and peace]{.mark}]{.underline};** beings have
become uncommon.

[[The **dystopia at the doorstep** is an emerging world
that]{.underline}]{.mark}-as the Invisible Committee so perfectly nails
it[-\"[holds itself together only through the **infinite management of
its own collapse**]{.mark} .\"]{.underline}5 Moreover , as we are
already seeing , [the constant [exposure in this world to]{.mark} all
manner of [manmade]{.mark}]{.underline} and civilization-driven
[[disasters]{.mark} , hazards , risks, [and dangers will be met with a
demand of \"resilience]{.mark}]{.underline} ,\"6 wherein people are
enjoined to brace themselves and take it, rather than to aspire to build
lives free of unnecessary insecurity and suffering.

[In such a coming world , [private corporate]{.mark} and state
capitalisms [are bound to entrench their reign]{.mark} , [for]{.mark}
the required [technological gigantism]{.mark} [, along with the
**escalation of mass consumption**]{.mark} , [will]{.mark} collude to
[make corporations indispensable]{.mark} .]{.underline} Corporate
expertise , corporate research and development , corporate prospecting
(for energy and mineral sources) , and corporate products will be needed
to keep sundry techno-fixes rolling in , as well as various forms of
\"bread and circuses\" (chicken nuggets and Netflix) for the masses .
[Corporations will generate even more enormous revenues than they do
today]{.underline} , via government subsidies and via catering their
commodities to billions of people . As author Raj Patel puts it,
\"corporations may be the creatures of the modern market economy , but
in order for profits to flow, they need to conscript consumers to the
market .\"7 Indeed , there is a snug fit between consumer-population
size and private-sector opulence , conspicuous in the correlation
between today\'s richest industrial sectors and their burgeoning
middle-class clientele .

The continued growth of the global middle class-the mainstream\'s basic
strategy for creating greater equity among people , or social justice a
la the Economist-will serve to make the financial and corporate giants
of banks , energy , media , entertainment , electronic gadgets , food ,
agricultural commodities , pharmaceuticals , apparel , and real estate
wealthier and more powerful than they already are . Thus , even as the
current trend toward curbing extreme poverty continues into the future ,
the gulf between rich and poor , between the gilded few and the
hand-to-mouth many , will persist-precisely because it is the hoi polloi
in the middle (and their governments) who are filling the coffers of the
(presumed as) privileged \"one percent .\" Additionally , whatever
relatively wild places remain will be slated as the real estate and
vacation destinations of the most affluent-as they are , after all,
already today.

[[In such a world]{.mark}-whatever it augurs for humanity , which seems
sadly bleak-[**biodiversity will suffer a tremendous blow**. Life\'s
richness will not survive]{.mark} a world that is a magnification of the
one we live in-]{.underline}with more industrial agriculture , growing
livestock numbers , more global trade , more industrial infrastructure ,
and greater materials and energy consumption (even with efficiency
gains)-[let alone a world where , in addition , [climate-related
catastrophes]{.mark}]{.underline} and unpleasant surprises [[are
expected]{.underline}]{.mark} . As discussed earlier , while
[[biodiversity is often equated with numbers]{.mark} of species on Earth
, [it is far greater than]{.mark} [a]{.mark} species
[inventory]{.mark}]{.underline} . Life is bewildering in its creative
expressions , its beauty , strangeness , and unexpectedness , its
variety of physical types and kinds of awareness , and its dynamic and
interweaving forms of worldmaking. [[This unfathomable wealth]{.mark}
and infinite source of well-being i[s what humanity is witlessly
forfeiting in exchange for heading toward maximizing its population size
and consumer spending power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Impact---extinction---2NC

#### The impact is [extinction]{.underline}---managerialist thinking skews politics into propaganda obscuring an underlying drive towards annihilation present in technology

(Caterina Resta--- professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the University
of Messina , Heidegger and Contemporary Philosophy: Technology, Living,
Society & Science, "The Age of the Totalitarian Domination
of Technology," Chapter 1: 17-18)

The era of **[total [global tech]{.mark}nological
[domination]{.mark}]{.underline}**, therefore, **[not only [marks the
end of philosophy]{.mark}, [but also the end of
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- as Heidegger understood--, which is
forced to serve the techno-economic interests that nowadays impose their
dominion directly without opposition and without intermediaries,
particularly through the technical and economic command of computation[.
**[Politics]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[now only [serves as
propaganda]{.mark} and apologetics: as a mere 'persuasive' cover and
collector of consensus [for]{.mark} increasingly [obscure
technical-economic interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For its part,
**[[technology is never neutral]{.underline}]{.mark}**, since it is
already constitutively pre-disposed[, [as will to power]{.mark}, to a
violent politics of power and robbery, which will be all the more
effective]{.underline}, the more it pursues objectives and interests
that are not extrinsic to it. The new Lords of the Earth will be the
Lords of Technology, **[those able to put themselves at the service of
this planetary, totalitarian power, [which will then launch its]{.mark}
final attack [on]{.mark} both [the Earth,]{.mark} sacking and
[devastating it,]{.mark} along with its inhabitants.]{.underline}**

The animal rationale is transformed into the technologized animal, while
the being-at-work **[names the new truth that the era of [technology
reveals]{.mark}, also "fixing" [the essence of]{.mark}
man]{.underline}**: "The laboring animal \[das arbeitende Tier\] is left
to the giddy whirl of its products so **[that it may tear itself to
pieces and annihilate itself in [empty
nothingness]{.mark}]{.underline}**".46 What characterizes homo technicus
above all else is therefore self-annihilation, a sinister propensity to
self-destruction.

### Impact\-\--anthroprocentrism\-\--2NC

#### Techno-Managerialism is a [ideology]{.underline} propagated to [advance anthropocentrism]{.underline}.

**Crist \'19** \[Eileen; September 2019; Bachelor's from Haverford
College in sociology, doctoral degree from Boston University; OUP
Academic, Abundant Earth: Toward an Ecological Civilization, "The
Framework of Resources and Techno-Managerialism," Ch. 3\] //wdu

[The [prevalent response to **ecocatastrophes**]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[has not been to **confront** the
worldview]{.underline}]{.mark} driving the blotting out of innumerable
beings in blitzkrieg campaigns or by a thousand cuts.19 Virtually no
mainstream politician, media outlet, or organization has contested the
historical legacy of humanity's declaring itself supreme, displacing
nonhumans and wilderness, and reinventing Earth as civilization's stage
set. Rather, [the [typical response]{.mark} to ecological problems [is a
riff on the **anthropocentric narrative**]{.mark}. Foremost focus
centers on how **humanity's impact** might affect the fate of humanity
itself]{.underline}. "Human driven changes to the environment," analysts
worry, "are raising concerns about the future of Earth's environment and
its ability to provide services required to maintain viable human
civilizations."20 Such concerns are often followed up with exhortations
about the unique strengths of the human---our intelligence,
resourcefulness, and innovative esprit--- through which we might resolve
diffi culties on our march.21

[Implicitly [**confirming** instead of challenging the human supremacist
worldview]{.mark}, the dominant framework for dealing with environmental
fallout is **piecemeal** and **technomanagerial**]{.underline}.22 The
piecemeal approach [[treats each problem in **isolated** fashion,
instead of viewing mounting problems **collectively**]{.mark} as
symptoms of **unrestrained expansionism**]{.underline}. The pragmatic
pitch, or enthusiastic push, for technomanagerial solutions rests on the
[received conviction of **human exceptionalism**]{.underline}. Indeed,
today's most common spin on the Differential Imperative---the axiomatic
status of human distinction---is [perdurable faith in the
**technological** and **managerial** prowess of our species to carry the
**human enterprise** onward and forward]{.underline}.

Technoscientific reports and popular [[media showcase a host of
ostensible solutions]{.mark} to **ecological conundrums** framed [in a
**compartmentalized**]{.mark} and technomanagerial
[register]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, scientifi c and policy
reports aver that shortages of freshwater for agriculture, industry, or
urban uses might be tackled via desalination, or by other
megaengineering projects like rerouting entire rivers. Diminishing
fossilfuel reserves will be countered (and are being countered) by
[deploying high impact technologies that flush hardtoaccess
deposits]{.underline} from deepsea and land sediments, mountaintops,
boreal forests, and other landscapes. Down the road, researchers hope to
repurpose algae, switchgrass, or other biomass into fuel and perhaps
food. [[Should **climate disruption** become ominous, humanity might
rely on **geoengineering**]{.mark} wizardry]{.underline}---a newfangled
"Star Wars Initiative" [against a global warming offensive some tipping
point]{.underline} or other might launch.23 Adequate food production
will be secured by effi cient management of and, water, fertilizer, and
pesticide inputs, as well as by corporate rearrangements of crop and
animal DNA, so the former can grow on arid, degraded, or fl ooded lands
and the latter made to balloon into bigger "protein" portions. As wild
fish are depleted, industrial aquaculture operations can be (and are
being) escalated; and since the ocean fish needed to feed farmed fish
are running out, no doubt someone is working on how to fatten confi ned
fish on soymeal, corn, or chicken.

In framing environmental challenges as piecemeal technical and
managerial challenges, [[the big picture]{.mark} within which problems
are **swelling** [disappears from the **terrain of
questioning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since [humanity's dominance is not
on the table for **scrutiny**, but on the contrary remains the
foundation for moving forward, the mainstream approach is to **frame
problems** within the established order]{.underline} and apply
singlefile interventions. Unsurprisingly, "innovation" is the buzzword
of the day. Largescale research efforts and financial investments are
poured into technological inventions, technofixes, and efficiency gains.

The [**technomanagerial paradigm** is pervasive and its
**brainchildren** are copious and multifarious]{.underline}: ranging
from plans to redirect rivers like the Ganges and Brahmaputra in order
to irrigate agroindustrial landscapes, to parodysounding technofixes
such as "Robochop," a proposed remoteoperated fl eet of robots for
mashing up jellyfish blooms (caused by humanity's massive disruption of
ocean life).24 To give a third example, in August 2015, in the midst of
a California drought, Los Angeles offi cials had the city's water
reservoir blanketed with ninetysix million black, fourinch plastic
"shade balls" to prevent evaporation. "This is a blend of how
engineering really meets common sense," one of the decision makers
opined. "We saved a lot of money, we did all the right things."25
Diverting India's holy rivers, engineering jellyfish exterminators, and
covering city drinking water with plastic balls: These are examples of
initiatives through which [the mainstream's technomanagerial approach
endeavors to deal with the Pandora's box of plagues that **human
expansionism** has unleashed]{.underline}. A planet inundated with
gigantic engineering works such as megadams, desalination plants, and
nuclear power facilities, but also gimmicky technofixes and BandAid
solutions that sound like Onion editorials--- this is the new world
order coming online.

[[Technomanagerialism is itself the legacy of the secularly established
"**empire of mankind**]{.mark}" that the early modern period
launched]{.underline}. The contemporary technological and [managerial
framework epitomizes this **psychohistorical inheritance**]{.underline}.
Over the course of time, [the more the non human domain has come under
man's disposal, the more **confidence**]{.underline} have humans come to
feel in their power to calculate, engineer, plan, mold, and solve. At a
microlevel, confi dence in the framework manifests in the way sundry
problem sets and challenges are taken up, serially and diligently. At a
macrolevel, the technomanagerial framework's confi dence manifests in
the aura of haughty invincibility that envelops it---undaunted, as it
apparently remains, before the dire specters of rising seas, scorching
heat waves, shrinking fossilfuel reserves, species extinctions,
longlasting pollutants, deadly viruses, and the like. Problemspecifi c
and [[**endlessly innovating** technomanagerialism]{.mark} broadcasts
the missive that there exists no symptom it cannot
solve]{.underline}---a missive most especially loud and [[clear in its
refusal to tackle]{.underline}]{.mark}, or even look at, [[the **root
cause** of all banes]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The [technomanagerial framework sustains **human
colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while angling to contain damage and
effect some cleanup. Whether or not it could succeed in solving or
muddling through the immense quandaries humanity faces, the outcome is
bleak: [[If technomanagerial approaches fail]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
mission to address freshwater shortages, "feed the world," or mitigate
dangerous climate change (to mention three looming issues), [[the result
will be **unthinkable suffering**. If technomanagerial approaches
succeed]{.underline}]{.mark} in containing dire side effects for
humanity, while entrenching human planetary domination, the cosmic gem
of [[Earth will be turned into a **downgraded resource base** to serve
human users]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Just as [[there is an **underlying driver** of the problems we
face]{.underline}]{.mark} (a humansupremacist worldview that has
underwritten the biosphere's colonization), so there is an underlying
pattern to the mainstream solution framework (a diligent avoidance of
calling out that worldview). The prevalent technomanagerial framework
for civilizationendangering problems zooms the focus on, and even
kindles admiration for, the cleverness of Anthropos in the face of
adversity. By the same token, [this approach **safeguards** the belief
that Earth is the Planet of the Humans: by **never** allowing that
belief to be **unveiled** for conscious scrutiny and
rejection]{.underline}; and by rehashing alreadyacclaimed superior human
qualities as those to be marshaled for moving forward. By silently
summoning the supremacist worldview to the rescue, the dominant
framework bypasses unmasking that worldview as the very source of all
the problems that managers, technocrats, innovators, securitization
experts, and specialists of all sorts will try to solve.

Indeed, [[technomanagerialism seeks to make the **anthropocentric**
regime **sustainable**]{.mark} and thereby turn Earth's occupation into
a **success story** of civilized humanity]{.underline}. To wit: that
Earth belongs to humanity; that the planet consists in resources and
services for human advancement; and that human beings are exceptional by
comparison to all other species. The spell of this belief system seems
so soporifi cally potent that the [**civilized establishment** will
sooner assume charge of the planetary climate]{.underline} system, or
swallow the pill of mass extinction, than relinquish that belief system.

Ironically, the [steadfast loyalty to **human supremacy** is neither
**conscious decision** nor **deliberate strategy**]{.underline}. Just as
[[the engine of the **anthropocentric worldview**]{.underline}]{.mark}
has swallowed up the world in its compulsive
expansionism---regurgitating impoverished landscapes and ecological
amnesia in its place---so [[has]{.mark} it [swallowed up
humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}.26 Humans shaped the world in accordance
with a worldview that has conditioned their own perception and
constricted their own understanding. Otherwise stated, people are as
much a casualty of that worldview as the biosphere. For while human
beings have indeed wielded jawdropping technological works to unlock
nature's wealth, they have never been in control of the ontology that
nature's domination produces.27 [Plundering the **biosphere** has
transformed much of it---and ultimately will transform **all** of
it---into a realm that reflects the **domination project** back to the
human mind]{.underline}. People experience this biologically degraded
world as the real world, and are inexorably propelled to continue acting
according to its dictates. Thus has the creed of superiority and
entitlement ensnared humans in a feedback loop: it incited them to
conquer and humanize the natural world, and the conquered and humanized
world continually reinforced the supremacist credo. This vicious cycle
is the snare that humanity cannot seem to escape and the box many people
cannot even think outside of.

[Humanity appears locked into an **expansionist** way of
lif]{.underline}e. Even as the natural world is converted and folded
into a humanuser domain, so are [people confined inside an increasingly
narrower **ontological groove** through the erasure of **ecological
dimensions** of the living world]{.underline} through which they would
be set in motion, cultivated, in an alternative way. Superior and
entitled humans end up living banally on the Earth, and the kind of
Earth that might still enjoin them to "dwell poetically"28 is vanishing.
"If nothing succeeds like success," philosopher Hans Jonas astutely
remarked, "nothing also entraps like success." He proceeded to clarify
this statement by observing that "the expansion of \[man's\] power is
accompanied by a contraction of his selfconception and being."29

## Alternative

### ALT\-- Reflection 2NC---Overview 

#### The alternative is a form of releasement that reorients policy-making around ontological reflection rather than instrumental control, rejecting the techno-managerialist impulse to fix problems through calculation and instead affirming a world where nature is valued intrinsically, not merely as a resource.

#### 1\-- Reject Enframing: Reflection halts the logic of enframing that renders the planet disposable; by letting beings "be," we foster an ethic that sees mining, monoculture, and emissions as ontological violations, not just management failures. 

#### 2) Sartrean Obligation to the Commons: Ontological politics grounds civic responsibility in care for being itself which solves our links by implementing a participatory ethics that replace human-centered metrics with nature's own authority over how it is valued.

### Alt\-\--Solves\-\--2NC

#### Reflection reveals hidden interdependences which breaks down eco-anxiety and opens space for new, non-instrumental ontologies of care, inclusion, and ecological belonging.

The special edition opens with articles by two well established thinkers
in the field of climate psychology, Sally Weintrobe, followed by Paul
Hoggett. Weintrobe discusses [the **conflict** between the perverse
nature of living with a [**neoliberal** state of mind]{.mark} that
damages a natural, human **sense of care** for each other, [forcing
people to live in ways that are damaging to]{.mark} each other and [the
environment]{.mark}. To]{.underline} knowingly, even if unconsciously,
[cause damage to one's surroundings, is to enter a world of
trauma]{.underline}. This is what Weintrobe calls a culture of uncare
and omnipotent phantastical thinking: [[the idea that a human being can
overcome]{.mark} and conquer [everything]{.mark} because as an Exception
to all other systems in our shared ecologies, one [can be a warped
version of what it means to be human]{.mark}]{.underline}. In doing so,
Weintrobe speaks directly to the theme of trauma and ecological
interrelatedness (or the lack of it). Drawing on Weintrobe's studies of
the culture of uncare, Hoggett discusses the value and meaning of care
in our society and calls for an [**'ecowelfare'** society where care is
not a **service** that is provided but draws itself closer to something
that can truly be called 'care]{.underline}', and argues that attention
to the feminine is a way of moving from care as service to care as care.
There are in both of these contributions a warning and a [desire to
refine humanity's **definitions** of what it means to relate to each
other and to our **ecosystems**]{.underline}. Behind their erudition
lies a criticism that resonates with revolution. Weintrobe is
'anti-capitalist' and Hoggett is a sort of 'left wing conservative' (may
the authors forgive us for the sin of over-simplification), something
new, something different to any current political and social offering.

The [sense of something new, radical and the [need for a
**re-evaluation** of the very basis for our thoughts continues
in]{.mark}]{.underline} Adlam's study of **[[climate
migration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For Adlam, social inclusion is a key
to creating a different society, as opposed to the all-pervasive society
of exclusion that we live in today. [Using the climate crisis as a means
of reconfiguring perspectives of **social inclusion** and exclusion,
Adlam explores the [tension between climate change and ecological
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, attitudes towards migration and
homelessness and concepts that configure ideas around the nature of the
State and how this is challenged by the impending end of 'fossil
capitalism'.\
In line with Adlam, Bednarek [emphasises the 'death of the familiar',
and with this, the [end of a dependence on **capitalist** structures
that fail to provide]{.mark} humanity with [a **balanced view**]{.mark}
of how humans fit into earth systems]{.underline}. Bednarek further
emphasises Adlam's thesis for inclusivity by discussing how marginalised
aspects of society need to be re-integrated, just as the right and left
hemispheres of the brain need realigning in ways previously suggested by
McGilchrist's (2010) seminal work The Master and His Emissary.

In our work as editors, we have taken different perspectives on the
topic, but [all pointing to the [need for **radical
change**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This change will necessarily
emerge from young people, the adults of tomorrow. Harvey is concerned
with paying attention to the child's view of the world that she is
inheriting. Quoting a children's poem by Michael Rosen, Harvey contrasts
a childish simplicity with a damaging over-burdened adult existence that
is too busy to notice what is happening to the world around us, and
especially [[too busy to 'see' more than the basic utilitarian
nature]{.mark} of the practicality of everyday objects that populate our
world]{.underline}, such as a kitchen knife. Harvey implores the reader
to [[**slow down** and reflect upon ecological and social
**interconnectedness**]{.mark}, in the hope that such a meditation [may
contribute to]{.mark} an [understanding]{.mark} of humanity's place in
the planetary system, [and therefore to a **change of direction** in the
face of the planet's **destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which also
becomes synonymous with humanity's end.

In a similar vein, Hickman provides a data-rich study of
[[**eco-anxiety** and how this is translated]{.mark} by young people
[into radical possibilities]{.mark} for their own future
world.]{.underline} Hickman provides a multi-layered view of
eco-anxiety, and points to the paradox that parents may feel that they
wish to protect children from eco-anxiety but at the same time remain
powerless to respond to the demands from their children to actually do
anything about the source of this anxiety. So, maybe the eco-anxiety in
children is a healthy response to older people's unhealthy inability to
take effective action.

Finally, Manley's article uses the shock of the Coronavirus to ask
whether the time has arrived to radicalise, shake up and change the very
basis of the way society thinks, by [[sweeping away tired approaches of
neoliberal thinking]{.mark} in order to experiment [with mould breaking
**ontologies**]{.mark}, where 'rational' individualism can be radically
**challenged** and **replaced**]{.underline}, or at least reconsidered,
with different ways of thinking and feeling. The article itself, in the
way it is written, aims to confront a normative approach to academic
thinking and asks the reader to think differently. In this process,
social dreaming, along with Deleuzian precepts is postulated as a change
agent of thought.

#### **Climate collapse signals a breakdown in our relationship with nature---the alt reopens the human--nature relation beyond calculation and control, creating the ontological space for change that techno-managerial solutions foreclose.**

**Rentmeester \'15** (Casey -- Professor of Philosophy @ Bellin College,
PhD in Philosophy from University of South Florida, \"Heidegger and the
Environment\", 2015, New Heidegger Research,
DOI:10.5040/9798881813079//phs-maubu)

Among the many legacies that Martin Heidegger's philosophy leaves is an
emphasis on the proper meanings of words. In fact, in his magnum opus,
Being and Time, Heidegger argues that "the ultimate business of
philosophy is to preserve the force of the most elemental words in which
Dasein expresses itself, and to keep the common understanding from
leveling them off to \[an\] unintelligibility."1 For Heidegger, words
have a force or charge that requires respect, and Dasein---the human
being in its openness to being \[Sein\], that is, in its openness to the
significance of beings---has a responsibility not only to defer to the
meanings of words but also to maintain the forceful nature of words.
Above all else, Heidegger stresses the importance of asking the right
questions with the proper words. In fact, Heidegger claims "questioning
is the genuine and the right and the only way of deeming worthy that
which, by its highest rank, holds our Dasein in its power."2 [[It is
fitting for humans to question]{.mark} not only the world around us, but
also **[our relation to the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such
questioning does not happen in a vacuum; rather, Heidegger repeatedly
emphasizes that human beings are fundamentally social in nature. Since
"the world of Dasein is a with-world,"3 i.e., since humans always share
the world with others and thereby question with others, it is important
to be open to the proper questions we face as human beings.

As Fried argues, "the principal challenge of Heidegger \[is\] . . . to
respond to questions that arise from the pressing concerns of the world
within which we live."4 Heidegger's corpus includes an impressive array
of such questions, including novel interpretations of the experience of
technology, science, art, language, and poetry, among others.
Importantly, Heidegger argued that all questions arise historically.
Since human beings have "facticity,"5 that is, since human beings are
situated in a certain place at a certain time in a certain context, and
so forth, the questions that arise are contingent on this place, time,
and context. I argue that the fundamental question that we humans need
to ask is as follows: "[[What is our proper relationship to the natural
world]{.underline}]{.mark}?" Heidegger would say that [deep questions
such as these [emerge in situations of breakdown]{.mark}]{.underline}.6
When things are not going right, fundamental questions arise that there
is no point in asking when things are going smoothly. To use one of
Heidegger's famous examples, [[we don't recognize]{.mark} that [the
hammer]{.mark} we are using [is unfit for the job until a problem
arises]{.mark} as we use it]{.underline}.7 Similarly, for most of human
history, there was no need to question the human relationship with the
natural world since we did not come across breakdowns that initiated
basic questioning. Now, however, climate change is an obvious sign of a
breakdown concerning the human relationship with nature. Consider recent
statements from climatologists and climate philosophers: Lonnie G.
Thompson, a world-renowned climatologist, explains the issue of climate
change in the starkest of terms: "Global warming poses a clear and
present danger to civilization"8; Dale Jamieson, one of the first
professional philosophers to analyze climate change, argues that climate
change requires a paradigm shift in our philosophical approach to the
issue9; indeed, Martin Schönfeld, a contemporary philosopher who
specializes in climate issues, argues that, due to climate change,
"culture as we know it must be reinvented, identity as such must be
redefined, and reality in its entire environmental gestalt must be
reappraised."10 These are not hyperbolic, apocalyptic ramblings; rather,
they reflect the sobering reality of our situation. Put simply, climate
change is a sign of a breakdown regarding the human relationship to
nature.

With any such breakdown, we do right to find the proper words to
understand the situation. The most fitting word that captures our
predicament is the ancient Greek word κρίσις \[krisis\], from which we
derive our English words "crisis" and "critical." The ancient Greeks
understood κρίσις as an unstable pivotal situation that required a
decision.11 For instance, the Greek historian Thucydides speaks of the
κρίσιv ἔχειν \[krisin exein\], i.e., the event to be decided, regarding
the fate of the Peloponnesian War.12 As in pivotal situations like wars,
[[human]{.mark} beings [have come across a critical juncture regarding
our relation to nature]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} such a juncture [requires a
decision as to the]{.mark} appropriate [way
forward]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his late-1930s work, Contributions to
Philosophy, among the "decisions" humans have in modernity that
Heidegger lists is "whether nature is degraded to the realm of
exploitation by means of calculation and ordering"13 or whether we can
embrace a new understanding of the human--nature relationship. If we
update this to our present situation, [we can say that [climate change
forces us to make a decision]{.mark}]{.underline} as to the proper way
forward: do we continue to exploit the natural world in accordance with
the calculative and ordering tendencies of natural science and industry
as we have done since the Industrial Revolution or are we able to open
up a new relation between humans and nature that is not built upon a
conqueror-- conquered model?

Ruth Irwin argues that [[climate change is]{.mark} precisely [the sort
of breakdown that necessitates a reorientation towards
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}. She states, "[[Backed into a
corner]{.mark} by climate change, [it is impossible to retain the same
ways of doing things]{.mark} that have characterized the last
epoch]{.underline}."14 [In [facing]{.mark} the real possibility of a
[collapse]{.mark} of human civilization, Irwin argues that [the proper
response is to **reflect on the finitude of
civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As she puts it, "In the face of the
utter finitude of our world and the concurrent complete loss of meaning,
Heidegger draws ultimate strength."15 Heidegger's philosophy [[provides
us]{.mark} with [a lens]{.mark} from which [to understand the
crisis]{.mark} of climate change insofar [as]{.mark} his thought offers
[an analysis of the]{.mark} conceptual [underpinnings in the]{.mark}
[West]{.mark}ern world [that have sanctioned environmental
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}. His thought also provides the
scaffolding for a new understanding of the proper human--environment
relationship. Before we can understand this analysis and Heideggerian
framework, though, we need to get a sense as to what the crisis entails.

#### 'Alt fails' is [wrong]{.underline} and rooted in [managerial logic]{.underline} to drive away attention

**Klikauer \'13** (Thomas -- Senior Lecturer @ University of Western

Ideology\", 09-05-2013, Palgrave Macmillan, a division of Macmillan

The organisation of managerial matters is at the same time ideological
as well as a practical project. The term 'project' accentuates most
clearly the specific character of [[Managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It results from a determinate choice seizing 'one' among many ways of
comprehending, organising, and transforming managerial reality. [This
choice defines the range of possibilities open on this way and precludes
alternative possibilities [incompatible with]{.mark} what would indicate
[a non-managerial future]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such non-managerial
alternatives have several criteria for truth by differing from truth as
proposed by Managerialism. These criteria must refer to the manner in
which such a non-managerial historical project realises the given
possibilities. They are not merely formal possibilities but those
alternatives involving the mode of human life and environmental
sustainability. Such realisation or actualisation (Hegel) is essentially
under way.

Even established managerial societies are realisations of concrete
versions of Managerialism and anti-Managerialism.
[[Managerialism]{.mark}'s]{.underline} project tends to [**[prejudge the
rationality of alternative]{.mark}** projects in order [to **keep
society within its own framework**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same
time, every managerial society is confronted with the actuality and
possibility of a qualitatively different historical practice which might
destroy Managerialism's existing institutional framework. In other
words, the ideological achievements of Managerialism are never secured.
Managerialism can never rest.

[[Managerial societies]{.mark} have already [demonstrat]{.mark}ed [the
ideological value projected into their own history]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This has succeeded in [converting the human struggle with nature into a
**market-competitive**]{.mark}]{.underline} struggle of Hobbesian
proportions. [[Managerialism seeks]{.underline}]{.mark} a bellum omnium
contra omnes -- [a '[competitive' war]{.mark} of all against all
covering everyone and every society]{.underline}.833 [Its ideology also
[reproduces and protects human existence with the]{.mark} [exception
of]{.mark} those [who have been used as scapegoats to divert
attention]{.mark} away from the pathologies Managerialism has
created]{.underline}. They are declared outcasts, enemies, aliens,
radicals, foreigners, misfits, hippies, delinquents, and so on. [In the
'[blame the victim']{.mark} [version of Managerialism's]{.mark}
ideology, these [are]{.mark} Managerialism's [most severe
victims]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Conclusion: [A Post-Managerial World is **Possible**]{.underline}

[[Managerialism alters the relationship between the **rational** and the
**irrational**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Contrasted with the fantastic and
insane aspects of managerial rationality (means), [the realm of [the
irrational]{.mark}]{.underline} (ends) becomes the home of those who
[[make us believe]{.mark} that they and [the **system** they represent
are]{.mark} utterly [rational]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the [ideas which
Managerialism promotes as 'the' **way of life** become increasingly
irrational. Total **environmental disintegration** may well be the price
for the next supercheap deal]{.underline} on a toaster, a car, a fridge,
or a flat-screen. Today, following the completion of 'the structural
transformation of the public sphere'904 and Managerialism's colonisation
of the lifeworld,905 [[managerial societies]{.mark} manage, shape,
[define]{.mark}, or at least infiltrate [all]{.mark} normal forms of
[human-to-human **interactions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This structure
validates even human communication in accordance with Managerialism's
requirements. [Values alien to Managerialism no longer have other media
of communication]{.underline}.906 They are largely excluded from the
public sphere and banned into the realm of abnormality, obscurity,
utopia, and fiction. But this domain still has space for freedom of
expression enabling nonand anti-managerial writers and artists that do
not conform to the ideology of Managerialism to call things by their
true name. While Managerialism's Orwellian Newspeak governs
communicative interactions and human thinking in managerial societies,
there are still those who name the otherwise unnameable.907

It is no longer human imagination that speaks but Managerialism. It is
[Managerialism's false reality that justifies and supports everything
except those who talk the talk of **resistance**]{.underline} against
the spectre of Managerialism. Imagining this means overtaking managerial
imagination.908 But ugliness, [torture, misery, **[environmental
destruction]{.mark}**, and human **suffering** on epidemic scales still
[haunt many inside managerial societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
the setting in which the great human achievements of management science
and technology -- as announced by the Harvard Business Review on a
monthly scale and in the daily but ordinary business -- take place.
Meanwhile, [[efforts to save]{.mark} and improve [human life have become
a **futuristic** promise]{.mark} in the face of looming environmental
disaster]{.underline}. The wilful play with non-managerial fantasies and
the human ability to act with good conscience contra Managerialism
testify to the extent to which human imagination remains the prime
mechanism of human progress. It is also one that -- like many others in
managerial societies -- is methodically and meticulously abused by
Managerialism.909

Setting [the movement, manner, and appreciation of post-managerial and
**environmentally sustainable** life, the power of [post-managerial
imagination far exceeds]{.mark} the manipulation of
[words]{.mark}]{.underline} that -- necessarily -- remain part of
Managerialism. It shows faked managerial sense-making for what it is:
(managerial) nonsense. But it also turns this nonsense into sense,
leading to previously unimaginable realms of undistorted thinking that
encroach on managerial ideology, mystique, objectified science, false
life, industrial death, simulated joy, and misery.910 [Managerialism
still reveals its terror in its rampant **ideological** fights against
environmental sustainability]{.underline}, in the management of
[destructive **manufacturing** plants, **resource extraction**, and in
**animal laboratories**]{.underline}. The latter remain hidden through
ideological inventions such as the modern 'Business Park' usually set in
pleasing surroundings. Simultaneously, corporate headquarters display
deluxe interiors, mini(and-not-so-mini-)bars, soft wall-to-wall
carpeting, exquisite lounge chairs, sweet background music, television,
internet, and the infamous '\$6,000 shower-curtain'.911

The [paralleling of pleasantry with global horror in such
[realisations]{.mark} does [hardly penetrate into the **consciousness**
of the inhabitants of managerial societies]{.mark} who have been
shielded from **critical awareness**]{.underline} by corporate mass
media. Managerialism takes this for granted, justified by the managerial
achievements of CEOs and top-management 'alone' when business success is
converted into ideological might rather than objective right. Upon these
achievements, Managerialism even flaunts its 'soaring compensation
packages and such perks as corporate jets' as perfectly rational in the
existing order.912 But these are mere tokens of managerial inventiveness
exposing the limits of imagination about what the corporate world is
capable of. The obscene [**segregation** of rampant
[Managerialism]{.mark} from social reality is [designed to destroy those
ideas capable of opposing]{.mark} **managerial
extravagance**]{.underline} and the unsustainable ways in which
managerial capitalism conducts itself. Managerial progress is always
accompanied by progressive and repressive rationalisations even if these
are imaginary figments. But the archetypes of corporate media horror,
silliness, and joy overlay the reality of a looming environmental
disaster. The daily media appearance of them depicts the irrationality
of the entire structure.

In reducing and even cancelling the human space of imagination,
managerial societies have forced critical imagination to prove itself on
new grounds. Critical reflections and critical theory have to produce
counter-managerial images that are translatable into historical
capabilities and projects. These translations will never be as bad but
they will distort those images that have been presented by
Managerialism. Separated from the realm of material production and
managerially invented needs, human imagination is never merely simple
play. [It may be invalid in the realm of managerial necessity but is
committed to [ethics, humanity, and truth of **post-managerial
living**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obviously, Managerialism seeks to cancel
such imaginations, images, and ideas of post-managerial living through
its own logic and its own managerial version of truth.

In the light of the capabilities of managerially guided societies, this
is not all just a play of the imagination tarred with managerial
(im)possibilities. The managerial idea of a 'science of imagination'
assumes an ever increasing ideological image.913 The possibility of a
managerialrational character of imagination has long since been
acknowledged and successfully exploited by Managerialism. It has also
been appropriated by organisational psychology whose task is the
behaviour manipulation of individuals aligned to behaviourism and
manifested in an acceptance of managerial rationality. Behaviourism's
Skinner once noted, 'what a fascinating thing! Total control of a living
organism ...' The underlying assumption \[of behaviourism\], according
to one critic, seems to be that 'the semi-starved rat in the box, with
virtually nothing to do but press on a lever for food, captures the
essence of virtually all human behaviour'.914 For the better part, [this
is the image that Managerialism's **organisational psychology** has in
mind for human beings]{.underline}.

Paradoxically, it is not the creation of post-managerial institutions
that present the greatest difficulty. [[Managerial societies]{.mark}
themselves]{.underline} are changing or -- at least partially -- [[are
beginning to change some of their **basic institutions** in the
direction of **post-managerial** living and **environmental
sustainability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The development of images of
postmanagerial satisfaction of all human needs is the prerequisite of
post-managerial living. This is incompatible with the prevalence of
managerial-corporate interests standing in the way of attaining this
goal. Qualitative change is conditional upon planning for the whole set
against the caprice of the free market. The so-called free market that
is in reality divided up and organised through a handful of
multinational corporations, is no longer unplanned as Managerialism's
own ideology of 'strategic management' insists. Nevertheless, it always
represents the sectarian interests of corporations and Managerialism.
[[A]{.mark} **free**, **rational**, **ethical**, **[environmentally
sustainable]{.mark}**, and [postmanagerial society can emerge only on
the basis of qualitative change]{.mark}]{.underline}. The institutions
within which post-managerial living can be envisaged disobey traditional
classifications of authoritarian, democratic, centralised, and liberal
institutions.

Today, [[**opposition** to the planning of sustainability]{.mark} in the
name of **liberalism**, markets, corporate freedom, competition, and
**corporations** [denies]{.mark}]{.underline} the reality of 21st
century human and [[**environmentally sustainable** living]{.mark}.
Managerialism's opposition serves as **ideological scaffolding** for its
repressive interests]{.underline}. The goal of authentic
self-actualisation by individuals depends on effective social and
environmental controls over the production and distribution of
necessities. This demands the achievement of post-managerial levels of
human culture, ethics, material, as well as environmental and
intellectual capacities. Rationality, once stripped of its exploitative
features and re-merged with ethics to become moral rationality rather
than Managerialism's instrumental rationality, would once again turn
into the guiding standard for developing the sustainable use of
resources for all. As such, [the recent ideology of a faked
contradiction between **rationality** and **ethics** has to be
**overcome**]{.underline}.

In this realm, ethical controls over resources and their use become
rational if established through meaningful [**self-actualisation** that
becomes effective]{.underline} in the realm of human decision-making.
This also [relates to the **production** and **distribution** of surplus
and to an individual's ability to set human and **environmental
goals**]{.underline}. In any case, the combination of ethical authority
and direct democracy is subject to infinite variations according to the
degree of development of the postmanagerial society.917
Self-actualisation will remain real to the extent to which individuals
are not dissolved into a mindless collective as portrayed by the
propaganda machine of Managerialism. [[The ideological 'Megamaschine'
**indoctrinates**]{.mark} and **manipulates** [individuals]{.mark}
rendering them [**incapable** of knowing and comprehending the true
state of **earthly resource depletion** and our ability to evaluate
**alternatives**]{.mark} to Managerialism]{.underline}.918

In other words, [[post-managerial societies would be **rational**,
**ethical**, **environmentally conscious**, and **free**]{.mark} to the
extent to which they are organised]{.underline}, sustained, and
reproduced by an essentially new historical project. Today, the
asphyxiation of managerial societies denies these requirements. The
power and efficiency of Managerialism, the thorough colonisation of the
human mind with managerially invented quasi-facts, the
thought-requirements of conformist behaviour, and engineered aspirations
downgraded to petit-bourgeois greed, still work against the emergence of
ethically and environmentally conscious individuals. They also work
against the notion that the much needed replacement of managerial
control might be termed 'control from below'.

### Alt\-\--Post-Managerialism\-\--Epistemology Real\-\--2NC

American management expert Robert R. Locke defines
[**[Managerialism]{.mark}** as 'what occurs when a special group, called
**management**]{.underline}, ensconces itself systemically in an
organisation and [[deprives owners and employees of their
**decision-making power**]{.underline}]{.mark} (including the
distribution of emolument), and justifies that takeover on the grounds
of the managing group's education and exclusive possession of the
codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient
running of the organisation'.6 Today, Locke's definition can be extended
because [[Managerialism]{.mark} has [extended itself from]{.mark} the
limitations of business [organisations to
**society**]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 Hence, a more appropriate
approximation to a definition might be:

[Managerialism combines **management knowledge** and ideology to
establish itself systemically in **organisations** and **society** while
depriving owners, employees]{.underline} (organisational-economical)
[and civil society]{.underline} (social-political) [of all
**decision-making powers**. Managerialism justifies the application of
managerial techniques to **all areas** of society on the grounds of
superior ideology, expert training, and the **exclusive possession** of
managerial knowledge necessary]{.underline} to efficiently run
corporations and societies.

[[This transition from management to Managerialism has **historic
origins**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After 18th and 19th century's simplicity
of running small workshops, firms, and small companies, factory
administration, i.e. management, grew larger.8 [Management [installed
itself as the **sole institution**]{.mark}]{.underline} with specialised
knowledge -- managerial knowledge -- to administer factories.9 [During
the [early **20th century** factory administration was turned into
management.]{.mark} Subsequently management expanded its
operations]{.underline}. By adopting legitimising ideologies such as
competition, efficiency, free markets, greed is good, etc. [management
mutated into an [**ideological operation** that today has
infected]{.mark} all sections of [human society]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
historical terms, [this occurred at first where '**Scientific
Management**' was invented, i.e. in the **USA**]{.underline}.
Managerialism's chronological trajectory could only ever be from
management to Managerialism. Historically, management and Managerialism
were not paralleling movements nor was the latter an ideology that
formed the practical expression of management. Management entered the
scene before Managerialism appeared.

In terms of an historical chronology, [[Managerialism is a genuine
**US-American** term because the USA has been at the **forefront** of
management techniques]{.underline}]{.mark} (Taylor, Ford, Drucker,
Porter, etc.) with the possible exceptions of French writer Henri Fayol
(1916) and partly German sociologist Max Weber (1864--1920).
Consequently, [it was [in the USA where management **first** became
Managerialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. '[During **Herbert Hoover**'s
years]{.underline} as Secretary of Commerce and then as president,
[Managerialism was further honed, until it became the sword's-point of
reform in the Roosevelt era]{.underline}. Managerialism was credited
with the prosperity of the Eisenhower 1950s.'10 In short, management is
an early 20th century term (Taylor, Fayol, and Ford) while the term
[Managerialism belongs to the late-20th century. Managerialism merges
**management** with **ideology**]{.underline}, thereby assisting an
expansion of something rather simplistic, trivial, mundane, and to be
honest, rather dull: the administration of a company. 'Management, to
put it plainly, is boring' (Scott & Hart 1991:39). But this [boredom
quickly expanded to become something that transcended simple factory
administration. [Subsequently, management mutated into a **full-fledged
ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline} under the following formula:11

Management + Ideology + Expansion = Managerialism

When management mutated into an '-ism', it joined a family of '-isms'.12
Put simply, '-isms' indicate an informal, often derogatory and
unspecified doctrine, system, and practice. In other words, '-isms' are
belief-systems with a cognitive content that is held up as being true.
Hence, an '-ism' is accepted as authoritative by a group or school. In
short, '-isms' represent a doctrine consisting of a shared set of common
ideological beliefs and practices. [To turn management into an ideology,
management first needed to come up with a proper
ideology]{.underline}.13 It has become commonplace to see ideology as a
set of ideas that constitute goals, expectations, and actions. [An
[ideology can be thought of as a **comprehensive vision**]{.mark}, as a
way of looking at things]{.underline}. It provides a worldview phrased
as a set of ideas that are proposed by a dominant class or group.
[[Members]{.mark} of such a group or society [receive the ideology in
order to create a **false consciousness**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Jaeggi outlined, 'ideologies are the means by which the predominant
situation is instilled in the hearts and minds of the individual'.14
[[Ideologies]{.mark} are used to [create **socialisation** and engineer
**compliance** so]{.mark} that the [victims]{.mark} of ideological
socialisation do not rebel but [support a given
ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}. The main purpose behind an ideology is
twofold:

1\. [It adheres to a common set of ideas where **conformity** already
exists]{.underline}. This is done [through normative thought
processes]{.underline}.

2\. It is the [task of ideologies to **cloak** the reality
of]{.underline}, for example, a given institution that is based on
**[contradictions]{.underline}**.

'Managerialism is about playing out ... a cacophony of aberrations and
inconsistencies'.15 [[Ideology]{.mark} seeks to masquerade
**uniformity** and an overall goal [based on a set of easy to digest
principles]{.mark} such as, for example, **competition**,
**deregulation**, **efficiency**, [**free markets**, and
**privatisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 Ideologies are systems of
abstract thought applied to public matters, thereby making ideology
central to politics and society. Implicitly, [a catch-all
**umbrella-ideology** such as [Managerialism seeks to redirect thinking
away from **truth**]{.mark}]{.underline} and into a specific direction
that is invented by a hegemonic and powerful group.17

As with most '-isms', Managerialism is, in the majority of cases, used
pejoratively rather than favourably. [Where [Managerialism]{.mark} is
dominant, its [**ideology** is made to appear as **common
sense**]{.mark} and requires no further explanation]{.underline}, e.g.
competition, the free market, etc. These [assumptions are backed up
through an **ideological legitimacy**]{.underline} delivered by
universities housing management schools that generate thousands of MBAs
and MAs in marketing, finance, operations management, and Human Resource
Management. The university association seeks to level management up to
the realm of science in an attempt to equalise management with science
on par with physics or at least with economics. University generated
management 'science' as a whole serves primarily as a PR exercise to
legitimate management.18

Where Managerialism needs a name (free enterprise, business community,
etc.) the choice is usually one that conceals the profit interests
leading to 'New Public Managerialism', 'Neo-Managerialism', and 'New
Managerial Nonsense' in the public sector and 'shareholder value' in the
private sector.19 'Shareholder value' comes along synonyms for
organisational goals, organisational outcomes, organisations objectives,
adding value, 'Triple Bottom Line' (PPP = people, planet, profit), 'The
Real Bottom Line', and so on. All of them conceal the profit motive.20
As an ideological cloaking device, shareholder-value is of particular
interest in the way it represents managers as mere agents of shareholder
principals. The central doctrine of Managerialism is that the
differences between, for example, universities and car companies are
less important than their similarities and that [the performance of all
organisations can be optimised by the application of **generic
management** skills and knowledge]{.underline}. It follows that the
crucial element of institutional reform and restructuring, to use one of
Managerialism's most favourite buzzwords, is the removal of obstacles to
'the right to manage'.21

Historically, [the [**rise** of Managerialism has gone hand in hand
with]{.mark} that of **reactionary programmes** of **[market-oriented
reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- e.g. Thatcherism -- and economic
rationalism and Neo-Liberalism elsewhere. Nevertheless, Managerialism
and Neo-Liberalism are not the same even though they share certain
affinities. Neo-Liberalism has a definite political programme -- as
outlined by Herrn von Hayek -- in the form of privatisation,
deregulation, annihilating welfare states, aggressive anti-unionism,
restrictive fiscal policy, [redirection of public spending, tax reform,
interest rates]{.underline}, floating exchange rates, trade
liberalisation, liberalisation of capital account of the balance of
payments, promoting market provision, legal security of property rights,
and the financialisation of capital. In contrast, [Managerialism is not
primarily concerned with such political issues.22 Its prime concern is
the management of **capitalism** and **society**]{.underline} in its
image. Both -- capitalism and society -- should mirror the way
corporations are managed. For Managerialism, management and managerial
techniques applied to corporations are the guiding principles, for
Neo-Liberalism it is the free market.23

Neo-Liberalism is about economics and politics, Managerialism primarily
deals with corporations and management and the function of both inside
'managerial economics'.24 [Neo-Liberalism even pretends to serve the
common good, [Managerialism has **no common good**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But perhaps the clearest point of difference between both remains
democracy.25 Managerialism is not a democratic programme. It does not
seek to influence politics to get democratically elected representatives
to further its political ambitions. Managerialism is primarily about
getting its managerial-reactionary programme carried out at company and
societal level.26 For Managerialism politics and democracy are simply a
hindrance on the way to efficiency and competitive advantages.27 In sum,
Neo-Liberalism is about democracy while for [[Managerialism the
**extermination of democracy** is]{.mark} no more than [a]{.mark}n,
albeit [welcomed, sideeffect]{.mark}]{.underline}. Inside the
neo-liberalist project, democracy and politics are important. Inside
Managerialism, none of them exists. For Managerialism, there are no
democratic solutions to problems, only managerial ones. Managerialism is
not about Rousseau's volonté générale (general will) of the people but
about engineering-like approaches to societal problems that have been
converted into technicalities.28

While Neo-Liberalism's background is economics, Managerialism is an
outgrowth of management. At first glance, Managerialism may even appear
inconsistent with traditional free-market thinking that promotes ideals
such as competitive markets supplied by firms. For NeoLiberalism the
free market is one of the key ideologies, for Managerialism it is merely
an obstruction. This has been perfectly expressed by one of
Managerialism's main ideological flagships, the Harvard Business Review,
29 when its former editor Magretta (2002:80--81) made the following
stunning revelation:

Business executives are society's leading champions of free markets and
competition, words that, for them, evoke a worldview and value system
that rewards good ideas and hard work, and that fosters innovation and
meritocracy. Truth be told, the competition every manager longs for is a
lot closer to Microsoft's end of the spectrum than it is to the dairy
farmers. All the talk about the virtues of competition notwithstanding,
the aim of business strategy is to move an enterprise away from perfect
competition and in the direction of monopoly.

Managerialism's ideology, rhetoric, and factual interests are worlds
apart when it comes to advocating 'free markets' while simultaneously
seeking to establish monopolies even though Managerialism may be
consistent with Neo-Liberalism's ideology of 'advocating' free markets.
Neo-Liberalism neglects to mention that this inevitably leads to a
monopolisation of the economy with a handful of corporations occupying a
domineering position. Managerialism actively seeks to establish this.30
Similarly, when Managerialism engineers takeovers of public entities, it
takes corporations as 'the' model. A relentless application of
managerial techniques to public administration paralleled by an
expansion of Managerialism into public policy areas brought the
previously relatively unknown idea that Managerialism entered the public
mind. 'The managerial revolution attracted very little public attention
because Managerialism did not call attention to itself; it was a dull
affair that appealed to the mentality of the accountant, not the
charismatic'.31 This was set to change.

Overall, Managerialism rejects any plea of a fundamental difference
between the operations of a hospital and the manufacturing and marketing
of soft drinks. In both cases, it is claimed, the optimal policy is to
design organisations responding directly to consumer demand, and to
operate such institutions using generic management techniques applicable
to all corporations. The main features of Managerialism at the level of
managerial regimes, for example, are unremitting organisational
restructuring, sharpening of incentives, and expansion in number, power,
and remuneration of senior managers, with a corresponding downgrading of
the role of skilled workers.32 This is accompanied by the trilogy of
'downsizing-rightsizing-suicising'. It extends to outsourcing and the
managerial reduction of employees to a material inventory framed as
human resources, human capital, and human material, lower their income,
and reduce their working conditions. All of these management measures
are supported by Managerialism's ideology.

For the purpose of this book, [ideology may be seen as 'knowledge in the
service of power]{.underline}'.33 This sharply distinguishes ideology
from philosophy or philo-sophia ϕιλοσοϕι ′ α -- the love of wisdom.
Unlike ideology that creates, or even simply invents knowledge for a
specific purpose, philosophy carries connotations to studying general
and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality,
existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. In Hegelian
philosophy, for example, philosophy is seen as serving nobody apart from
itself. It seeks to understand the world by examining its opposites
through analysing two sides of an argument, positives & negatives, pros
& cons, and thesis & anti-thesis. Examining these relationships creates
knowledge.

Being a rather one-dimensional affair, ideology, on the other hand, is
not geared towards examining positives and negatives. It does neither
exist in-itself (Kant) nor for-itself (Hegel. It exists because it
serves a purpose: 'knowledge in the service of power'. Its task is not
knowledge, understanding, and wisdom but covering up, eclipsing, and
distorting. Its telos is that of Hegel's master-slave relationships in
which ideological knowledge serves a master.34 Philosophy, by contrast,
is to a large extent defined by epistemology -- Greek ε πιστη µη
episteme -- meaning knowledge, understanding, and λο ′ γοζ logos as the
'study of'. By contrast, ideology can be seen as a set of ideas
constituted as goals for actions. The main purpose behind an ideology is
to make individuals adhere to certain ideals cementing 'the given' as
factum brutum and status quo. Ideologies create distorted forms of
knowledge and understanding while serving its masters (Hegel).

In short, [[Managerialism is an **ideology** that does not serve truth
but **invents** ]{.mark}**knowledge** in the service of power for [one
of the foremost **powerful institutions** in today's society:
**management**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When manage- ment metamorphosed
into an ideology, it expanded not only ideolo- gically but also
institutionally with setups reaching Managerialism's standard
broadcasting-system of corporate mass media. These special and
[[ideological organisations come]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[in
the shape of]{.mark} busi- ness lobbying [organisations]{.mark},
employer [federations, and institutions like the **OECD**, **GATT**,
**IMF**, **World Bank**]{.mark}]{.underline}, The World Economic Forum
in Davos, etc.35 Not surprising, therefore, is the institutional and
ideolo- gical expansion of Managerialism in corporate public relations,
its adoption by language experts, and the invention of what Don Watson
has described as 'weasel words':36

Managerialism, a name for various doctrines of business organisations,
also comes with a language of its own, and to such unlikely places as
politics and education. Managerialism came to the universities as the
German army came to Poland. Now they talk about achieved learning
outcomes, quality assurance mechanisms, and international benchmarking.
They throw triple bottom line, customer satisfaction and world class
around with the best of them.

Finally, there is also a specific version of capitalism that has
developed since management and subsequently Managerialism has taken the
helm. It is not Adam Smith's 18th and 19th century free market capital-
ism, nor is it 20th century social welfare capitalism.37 Managerial
capi- talism has successfully combined consumer capitalism with the main
ideology of the 21st century: Managerialism. This has been linked to
Managerialism's main transmission system of corporate mass media.
Together, they have infiltrated every eventuality of human existence.
This has created a managerial society based on competition, the free
market, efficiency, corporate growth, deregulation, corporatisation, and
privatisation.38 [[It is Managerialism that **ideologically** shapes our
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today, a child of such a managerial
society can enter a private kindergarten, a private school, a private
university and a private work- place without ever experiencing any
not-for-profit institution.39

Together, management, **[[managerial regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Managerialism, and managerial capitalism [have '[managed' to penetrate
society so effec- tively that it warrants the term **managerial
society**]{.mark}.40 They have pro- duced a managerial system and a
managerial society without **any serious opposition**]{.underline}. But
Managerialism's reach has also extended from managerial regimes deep
into the crypto-academic subject of manage- ment studies. Management
studies have relinquished nearly all forms of critical scholarship in
order to be a functional and ideological auxil- iary.41 [[The exclusion
of an opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} under Managerialism's TINA --
there is no alternative -- [[operates]{.mark} not only in **management
studies**, but also in **managerial regimes**]{.underline}, in
managerial capitalism, and [[in **society**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today,
one might, for example, quite legitimately and perhaps even urgently
ask:42

Does the annihilation of any serious opposition to Managerialism allow,
for example, global warming, climate change, corporate envi- ronmental
vandalism, resource depletion, and the passing of peak oil to wipe out
the human race?43

[Managerialism's effort to eclipse such a possible global
catastrophe]{.underline} overshadows the search for potential causes.
[[Managerialism has **anaes- thetised** society]{.underline}]{.mark} as
the case of global warming demonstrates.44 The causes remain
unidentified, unexposed, and un-attacked because they have receded
before the all too obvious threat of Managerialism. Equally obvious is
the need for being prepared to living on the brink of environmental
destruction, to face the global environmental chal- lenge, and to
prepare for an environmentally sustainable life in a post- managerial
society.45 But guided by Managerialism, we still submit to the
commercial production of the means of global destruction, to perfecting
wasteful goods and services, to being trained 'for' Managerialism in
what had once been 'our' school and 'our' university, and to defend the
offenders and that which they create.

### AT\-- Permutation---2NC 

#### Anything less than an uncompromising rejection fails---maintains libidinal investments in accumulation

I have stressed the important contributions that psychoanalysis can make
to the political economy of development by focusing on the "drive." It
is a concept that helps explain the excess underlying capitalist
development: it sheds light on the relentlessness with which capital
circulates, despite (and because) of blockages, leading to such late
capitalist phenomena as overaccumulation, imperialism and dispossession
in the global South; and it elucidates the unavoidable libidinal
investments people make in global capitalism, helping to better
understand the latter's continued persistence.

But in the face of the capitalist drive's relentlessness and apparent
unstoppability, what are the possibilities for change? [[To what extent
can the **accumulation drive** be resisted]{.mark}?]{.underline} As
evidence of such resistance, Harvey (2005) cites multiple global
struggles, old and new, against dispossession and enclosure of the
commons (a few were alluded to earlier). [He emphasizes the
"traditional" [Left trade-unionist politics]{.mark}]{.underline} centred
on class struggle and anti-capitalism[, [as well as]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the more novel [politics of social movements that responds to
injustice]{.mark}, globalization and dispossession]{.underline} from the
perspective of environment, health, indigeneity, gender, class and so
forth (2005: 176-8). While he endorses both types of politics as
necessary to challenge the power of capital and the state, he also
points out their weaknesses, including that they tend to be too
localized and parochial (especially social movement politics). [[What is
most lacking for the effective confrontation of global capitalist
power,]{.mark} according to him[, is "**connectivity between
struggles**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (2005: 179).

I agree with Harvey, but in keeping with my attempt to complement
political economy with libidinal economy[, I would like to add three
main qualifications to his argument that stem from the consideration of
drive. Firstly, [seriously challenging capitalist development would
require a drive at least as relentless and obdurate as the accumulation
drive]{.mark}. [This would mean **fully inhabiting (the death)
drive**]{.mark}, since it is its excess that enables breaking boundaries
and limits.]{.underline}9 In fact, for Žižek, because the death drive
allows us to defy constraints, [[it is the very source of human]{.mark}
[freedom and autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline} (Žižek and Daly 2004: 135;
Žižek 1999: 248). Following Lacan, he often cites Antigone as an
illustration --- she insists on burying her brother despite the law and
everyone around her stipulating otherwise, to the point of
self-endangerment (1989: 117). The implication is that an
anti-capitalist politics, to be effective, would need to insist on its
enjoyment (of the disruption of accumulation or a post-capitalist
alternative) to the very end; and do everything to achieve it, including
braving risk and peril. In other words, [[an anti-capitalist drive would
need to be nothing less]{.mark} than [uncompromising]{.mark} in the face
of the capitalist drive's dogged persistence.]{.underline}

This is all the more the case given that both labour and new social
movements have a recent history of compromise. he development of a
privileged worker-management class (a "labour aristocracy") has meant
that some, although certainly not all, trade unions in both the global
South and North have cozied up to corporate capital and the state, with
several of their members even voting for conservative and right-wing
nationalist parties (du Toit 2010; Kautsky 2002). Similarly, neoliberal
capitalism has been able to co-opt many social movements, taming them by
culturalizing and commodifying their demands --- for example, by
logoizing "multiculturalism" and niche-marketing products for the likes
of gays and lesbians, young women, "ethnic" and racialized communities,
organic food lovers, etc. A global anti-capitalist movement would need
to learn from these mistakes by daring not to compromise its desires.

[[Secondly]{.mark}, and relatedly[, **it is an anti-capitalist
fervour**]{.mark} (ie drive) [that would help lay the basis of global
connectivity and networking between and among labour/social
movements]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without an obdurate spirit, without
inhabiting drive's derailed excess, it is hard to see how a broad global
coalition could persist energetically or indeed adequately oppose the
power of capital.

[[And finally, challenging the accumulation drive would require
**recognizing capital as a common adversary**]{.underline}]{.mark}. New
social movement politics has been plagued by fragmentation and
parochialism as a result of the absence precisely of such commonality.
[While [accumulation]{.mark} [may not be the only source of
inequality]{.mark} and dispossession, [it certainly is]{.mark} one of
the primary ones (if not [the primary one]{.mark}), invariably
intersecting with gender, racialization, indigeneity, queerness,
environment, health, etc. [Constructing capital as the common adversary
would likely drive disparate radical groups to coalesce]{.mark},
solidify their collective resolve, [and persist in their
struggles]{.mark}.]{.underline} Let me quote Žižek at length on this
final point:

\[The undermining of a radical politics today\] is directly due to the
depoliticization of economics, to the common acceptance of Capital and
market mechanisms as neutral tools/procedures to be exploited \... all
the talk about new forms of politics bursting out all over, focused on
particular issues (gay rights, ecology, ethnic minorities \...) \... has
something inauthentic about it, and ultimately resembles the obsessional
neurotic who talks all the time \... to ensure that something --- what
really matters --- will not be disturbed \... So, instead of celebrating
the new freedoms and responsibilities \... it is much more crucial to
focus on what remains the same in this global fluidity \...: the
inexorable logic of Capital. (1999: 353-4, italics in original)

md

In our \'economy of appearances\' the total web of relationships
embodied in our ways of thinking and acting about the environment is
nearly impossible to discern (Harries-Jones 1995). Thus [[it is]{.mark}
equally difficult to understand how the choices that we make impact on
the material environment and other people\'s lives. As such it is
possible, if not [inevitable, for people to have \'green
sensibilities\']{.mark} and a strong commitment to social justice
[while]{.mark} consistently [doing things that are bad for the
environment]{.mark} [and that **perpetuate inequality**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} **[human suffering]{.mark}** [on a **global
scale**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This reality also [[makes it]{.mark}
nearly **[impossible]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} see and [understand]{.mark}
the connection of our relationships [in ways that]{.mark} would [make it
possible to]{.mark} **[learn from]{.mark} our
[mistakes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [[this
**worldview**]{.mark} also [informs interventions that]{.mark} are
[rapidly]{.mark} **[displac]{.mark}ing other [value systems]{.mark}**
and other ways of knowing and interacting with the world.]{.underline}
These displaced knowledge and value systems are often grounded in more
embodied and reciprocal relationships to the environment. This is not to
say they exist perfect harmony with nature or hold the secret key to
resolving our environmental problems. However, it is certainly the case
that they [are connected to **[ways of knowing]{.mark}** and interacting
with the world that [have]{.mark} largely **[been lost]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the global economy of [appearances]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Should we ever come to understand that
[**[managerial]{.mark}**/market-driven [approaches to
socio-environmental problems]{.mark} often [**paradoxically exacerbate**
the kinds of **problems**]{.mark} **[they are meant to
resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [these [other way of]{.mark}
**[knowing]{.mark} [and valuing]{.mark}** [the world]{.mark} will be
**[essential]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [finding **alternative
approaches**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Creating contexts in which many ways
of knowing and valuing the world can thrive will require much more
democratic approaches to conservation and development than is currently
the case. True democracy and diversity of values presents a level of
uncertainty beyond what most managerial/market-driven world making
projects are able to accommodate. As Charles Besançon, head of the
protected area program for the UN Monitoring Center, recently opined
about user-friendly databases, \"companies are always talking about
wanting certainty. We expect that these tools as they evolve and are
continually updated will become the standard\" (Kanter 2008). [There is
no question that [knowing more about the ecology of our planet]{.mark}
and how it works [is indispensable to finding viable solutions to our
current socio-environmental dilemmas]{.mark}]{.underline}. However we
[must]{.underline} always [[be mindful of]{.mark} the [difference
between **knowing the world**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [seeking to render
it]{.mark} wholly [predictable for the **purpose**]{.mark}**s [of
profit]{.mark}** [and **centralized management**]{.mark}. Worldmaking
[projects informed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the
**[managerial]{.mark}**/market-driven **[worldview]{.mark}**
continuously **[displace and transform]{.mark}** diverse forms of
[human]{.mark}-[environmental **relationships** in the name of
producing]{.mark} [a]{.mark} more predictable, [profitable]{.mark}, and
eco-viable [planet]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the growing movement for
bio-cultural diversity reminds us, [[diverse ways of
knowing]{.underline}]{.mark} and valuing the environment are embedded in
human-environmental relationships and cannot be maintained ex-situ. They
[[are]{.mark} displaced, **[erased]{.mark}**, and transformed along with
local food production systems and other systems of human-environmental
interaction in which they are embedded]{.underline}. Thus [we appear to
be making]{.underline} yet another exchange, though one that is rarely
acknowledged: [perceived certainty]{.underline} for the accumulated
stock of human ways of knowing and interacting with the environment. In
asking ourselves whether this is a fair exchange there are two things
that are important to keep in mind: 1) [[the appearance of certainty is
achieved through]{.mark} techniques and [tech]{.mark}nologies
[that]{.mark} **[commodify culture and nature]{.mark}**, [while]{.mark}
systematically **[concealing]{.mark}** the [considerable
**socio-ecological costs**]{.mark} of these processes]{.underline};
[and]{.underline} 2) [healthy ecosystems are defined by diversity and
**complexity**, and hence **uncertainty**.]{.underline} This applies to
the human systems to which ecosystems are integrally and inextricably
linked. In continuously drawing our attention away from this singularly
important relationship[, [the **managerial**]{.mark}/market-driven
[worldview allows us to believe]{.mark} that [it is possible]{.mark} and
desirable [to save the world through **consumerism**]{.mark} [and
**capitalist expansion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Paying closer attention
to the unstated assumptions of this worldview, and their inherent
paradoxes, will allow us to make more informed and efficacious decisions
about our relationships to the environment, as well as our relationships
to other people and their relationships to the environment. This essay
hopefully represents a small step in that direction.

#### [Perm fails]{.underline}---it is a classic neoliberal reframing tactic that zero's alt solvency.

of governance,\" vol. 48\] //wdu

The [transition between the **[managerial
governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the 1960s associated with PPBS and
[the one that [reemerged in the **neoliberal era**]{.mark}]{.underline}
was played out around the efforts of its proponents to solve two
important problems deemed responsible for the failure of PPBS.

The first stemmed from the [[challenge of reformatting
**decision-making** in managerial terms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Using
optimisation as a framework for policymaking meant that [everything that
one wished to take into account when making a decision would need to be
quantified as an input for **modelling**]{.underline}. Not only was this
computationally difficult, it was logistically impractical. The
**[[statistical infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** of national
bureaucracies [did not measure the kinds of things that needed to be
taken into account for systems]{.underline} analysis.47 Administrative
statistics had traditionally focused on accounting for resource use, but
there was a [[striking lack of data about policy performance and
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was this data [that systems analysts
required for its **cost-benefit models** to evaluate possible courses of
action]{.underline}. The result was a series of attempts to cut corners
and plug overly simplistic proxies to stand in for highly complex
processes. An egregious example was the much criticised use of the
'[**[body count]{.mark}**' during the Vietnam War]{.underline} as the
benchmark of progress [[within McNamara's **managerial war
machine**]{.underline}]{.mark}.48 This case would illustrate a recurrent
problem for managerial governance: many of the aspects it was supposed
to manage were not easily amenable to quantification.

The second problem was related to implementation and would become a
[defining **political fault line** for managerial
governance]{.underline}. Indeed, systems analysts quickly realised that
the [[plans developed]{.mark} centrally were often [**laid to waste**
once they arrived in the hands of]{.mark} professional public [servants
tasked to **implement** them]{.mark}]{.underline}.49 The
[**[distrust]{.mark}** on the ground [towards]{.mark}]{.underline} the
analytical methods of [[managerial planners led to **various forms of
resistance**]{.mark} that were blamed for the failures]{.underline} of
PPBS. Although this was already a problem reflected in the frequent
clashes between the military establishment and systems analysts,50 it
proved particularly [daunting in the sphere of social
policy]{.underline}. The greater decentralisation of policymaking in the
field of education, healthcare, or urban planning,51 and a widespread
lack of experience with the analytical practices of systems analysis,
contributed to spectacular failures.52

Together, [these problems could have led to the full demise of **systems
analysis**]{.underline}. Yet, the vast investments in a new policymaking
infrastructure at the time meant that there was a critical mass of
social forces with vested interests in the success of managerial
planning.53 Particularly important were the investments in social
reporting and performance management to feed the optimising calculations
of managerial governance.54 During the 1970s, the proponents of
managerial governance found new ways to [[**reframe** their
techniques]{.mark} and gradually **realign** their projects with an
[increasingly popular **neoliberal message**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
amorphous notion of market competition, in particular, would provide
them rhetorical cover to recast planning as a form of'market-like'
efficiency.

[Anthropologists know that **economic [personhood and behaviour
vary]{.mark}** [dramatically]{.mark}]{.underline} among different
cultures, and within cultural groups, and are also constantly changing
(Gregory, 1997, 1999, 2015; Sykes, 2007). [This knowledge, generated
mostly through detailed, long-term ethnographic work, has profound
implications for the **appropriate**]{.underline} design and framing of
questions around income expenditure (e.g. how it is consumed,
accumulated or redistributed), labour investment (Curry et al., 2015)
and discounting behaviour in relation to the impact of current
harvesting pressure on the future productivity of a resource (Cohen &
Foale, 2013; Foale et al., 2011). Economic investigations must account
for the intersection of market economies with subsistence and ceremonial
activities (Bainton & Macintyre, 2016) and the cultural and political
context of complex and often dynamic negotiations over tenure, in
addition to individual and collective benefits from both subsistence and
commoditised resources (Macintyre & Foale, 2004, 2007). This canon of
deeply socially informed environmental and economic research appears to
be either unknown or deemed irrelevant by many conservationist
researchers who perform large quantitative social surveys investigating
environmental conservation and resource management questions with little
or no attention to this sort of detail[.]{.underline} In addition to
making ungrounded assumptions about human behaviour, [transnational
conservation biologists and their allies often [perceive humans
as]{.mark} simply [an]{.mark} **[obstacle]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the
ultimate goal of [saving '**globally important'
biodiversity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Biodiversity [conservation]{.mark}
[goals are frequently framed]{.mark} [on a scale that
encompasses]{.mark} a number of very [different cultural groups]{.mark}
of people (e.g. the Coral Triangle); [therefore,]{.mark} we [observe a
common inclination to **disregard**]{.mark} **[inconvenient cultural
complexity]{.mark}** [when constructing]{.mark} research
[studies]{.mark}, [particularly for projects]{.mark} that are funded by
donors [whose worldview is shaped primarily by **Western environmental
ideals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Researchers with a predilection for
quantification and ignorance of (or even contempt for) relevant social
theory will count what is easy to count and simply ignore what is not.
They will opt for an impressive looking sample size that may or may not
have any useful statistical meaning in relation to parameters that
actually matter. Ultimately, such choices are more concerned with the
display of 'doing big science' than producing reliable, relevant and
useful 'truths'. The current academic system makes this approach,
despite extensive published critiques of it (Cannizzo & Osbaldiston,
2019; Ginsberg, 2011; Muller, 2018), easy to get away with and even
easier to sell. Austerity within the academy has also applied
significant pressure on researchers to spend less time in the field;
this applies pressure to generate data in ways other than participant
observation, which requires long periods of getting to know host
communities, learning their language and achieving a level of rapport
that allows many insights into culture, politics and history that would
never be possible with briefer periods of contact. [[**Managerialism**
within the academy]{.mark} [fosters **environmental
managerialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Interdisciplinary
[[journals]{.mark} that concern the environment are predominantly edited
by natural scientists, who [are]{.mark} typically [**ignorant**
of]{.mark} large swathes of social literature relevant to [**human
ecology** and]{.mark} [**cultural institutions** pertaining to
**environmental use and management**]{.mark}.]{.underline} An
increasingly disturbing problem in this rapidly expanding
interdisciplinary arena is that natural science journals tend to have a
much 83 3. The Unequal Place of Anthropology in Cross-Disciplinary
Research higher impact factor than purely anthropological or
sociological journals.1 Most natural scientists, particularly the
younger cohorts, are highly likely to judge the worth of a given
journal, and the work it showcases, based on its impact factor alone.
These same scholars also rarely consult books, including edited books,
which continue to communicate a large proportion of anthropological
research. [**[Global-scale crisis narratives]{.mark}**, panaceas [and
**'silver bullets'**]{.mark} [for environmental management are]{.mark}
[more likely to find favour with]{.mark} the [editors]{.mark} [of
**high-impact journals**]{.mark} such as Nature and Science than
**nuanced, rigorously theorised and painstakingly crafted case studies**
made in one or a small number of locations. They can also be made more
authoritatively with quantitative survey data that not only routinely
**[erases cultural difference]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} historical or
political complexity, but [also **forces**]{.mark} [**homogenising
assumptions** about economic behaviour]{.mark} such as possessive
individualism or homo economicus.]{.underline} Winning the big prize of
a publication in Nature or Science more or less immediately confers
rewards such as large research grants and promotion. Therefore,
regardless of whether a researcher believes a global-scale approach is
one that will be more likely to produce social data that is reliable and
closely represents the truth about questions that are the product of
theoretically solid research, the incentive to take this approach is
significant. The conservation biology worldview is one in which
scientific expertise about a given component of the natural world (be it
particular species, such as turtles or tigers, or entire ecosystems,
such as coral reefs or rainforests) confers not only a mandate but a
right to intervene in the lives of humans anywhere on the planet if they
are seen as presenting a proximate threat to the species or ecosystems
in question (Dowie, 2011; Fairhead & Leach, 2000; Fairhead, Leach &
Scoones, 2012). Therefore, publications on human--environment topics
with global scope (as represented by work that provides analyses of
peoples who are identified primarily in terms of their dependence on or
association with a global conservation target such as coral reefs or
rainforests) will be more likely to attract the attention of editors of
high-impact (and high-prestige) scientific journals. However, the
[global scope of the work necessarily applies pressure to erase
difference and complexity, which means that universalising forms of
social science]{.underline}, 1 At the time of writing, Conservation
Biology and Ecology and Society have impact factors of 5.89 and 4.55,
respectively, and Current Anthropology and American Anthropologist have
impact factors of 2.32 and 2.709, respectively. Unequal Lives 84 such as
behavioural economics or psychology, are more likely to be adopted than
anthropology, with its inconvenient focus on diversity. The one standout
exception that comes to mind is Joseph Henrich and colleagues'
cross-cultural examination of game theory, in which a series of
coordinated experiments were run by a large collaborating group of
anthropologists across 15 small-scale societies, specifically to
demonstrate cross-cultural differences in economic behaviour via the
results of playing games such as Ultimatum. The study ultimately
convincingly debunked the popular homogenising trope of homo economicus
(Henrich et al., 2005).

Trusteeship and managerialism in the development sector

The theory of trusteeship has three main implications for how poverty
and methods of dealing with human security are conceptualized. These
implications are also inherent in [managerial ideas of control and
progress]{.underline}. Firstly, the logic of trusteeship implies an
external locus of control for initiating change and progress.
[[Development]{.underline}]{.mark} is not something, which occurs
internally and during a specific historical moment, [it [is a
transformation]{.mark} of one region [into a superior order as a result
of those who are entrusted with the future of
society]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cowen and Shenton, in Corbridge, 2000, p.
34). Thus, and this is the second point, development is instilled with
an overbearing sense of design. [[Development must be planned]{.mark} in
order for it to be successful]{.underline}, and the rules for planning
and designing development endeavours must be taken on by those who are
thought of as having the capacity to lead such projects. In this way
[western traditions of [managerialism are **grafted on ideas of
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[planning]{.mark},
[bureaucracy]{.mark}, and [systemization]{.mark} [all]{.mark} become
processes that share [logics]{.mark} delineating [from development and
managerialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This leads us to the third and final
point. Through an emphasis on design and control, development has become
synonymous with linear-economic ways for steering such progress.
[[Progress is **endless** as]{.mark} are the [technological advances and

5\. Political struggles in the age of managerialism

This special issue aims to highlight why and how [[managerialism
deserves to be interrogated]{.underline}]{.mark} by IPE theorists as a
multifaceted object of analysis with important political consequences.
We aim for the issue to constitute a stepping stone for a broader
reflection on the ways in which managerialism dovetails or clashes with
other major systems of ideas in the global economy; on how it is
appropriated and mobilized by different social forces and agents for
different ends; on the complex processes of translation as these ideas
circulate from one social field to the next; as well as the diversity in
managerial practices across countries, sectors, and institutional
spaces. It is our belief that many of the key political struggles of our
time are increasingly mediated by managerial institutions and discourses
that help shape what is politically at stake in the global political
economy.

As the articles in this issue show, [[managerialism]{.mark} is
[increasingly]{.mark} [set]{.mark}ting the [parameters for what is
considered]{.mark} to be [a legitimate political intervention]{.mark}
[and has]{.mark} helped [diffuse corporate ways]{.mark} of doing things
[which narrow **the policy agenda**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a
point strongly made by Seabrooke and Sending who examine the ways in
which consultancy houses have fuelled a general trend towards
managerialism in IGOs. As they show, [the generalization of this
abstract [managerialism has curtailed the policy]{.mark} or development
space, narrowing which ideas are considered authoritative and
restricting who has a voice in the processes that govern these
organizations.]{.underline}

Similar to Seabrooke and Sending's interest in managerial cultural
frames, Eagleton-Pierce's study of NGOs in the field of international
development is also concerned with how the turn to managerialism
'reflects a more pervasive anxiety about institutional comportment and
how to appear to others as a "modern" organisation'. He charts how
managerialism rose from being a marginal phenomenon in the 1980s to
something that was increasingly viewed as 'fundamental', or even
'existential', from the early 2000s. Through the particular case of
Oxfam, he argues that the rationale for performance management is
manifested and concretely operationalized through an agenda on
monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL). Eagleton-Pierce explains how
and why the spreading of this form of managerialism unfolded via
attention to both structural tendencies, such as funding policies in
donor governments and IOs, as well as internal debates within Oxfam. He
documents not only the ways in which this normalisation process evolved,
but also the critique and resistance it provoked from NGO workers and
analysts.

In the process of mediating social struggles over the global economy,
[[managerialism]{.mark} has [transformed the nature of political
struggles]{.mark} and how agents conceive of what is at stake in
political struggles over the future of the global economy]{.underline}.
In Nunn's research on active labour market policies (ALMPs) he argues
that performance [[management agendas]{.mark} tend to [lead to
centralised control dynamics within bureaucracies]{.mark} [that have a
stake in]{.mark} such [policy]{.mark} games.]{.underline} He suggests
that the relative distributional form of the welfare state is being
reshaped through justifications derived from a managerial sensibility.
By analysing how consultants and public sector managers vie for the
authority to shape the performance management of labour markets, Nunn
argues that managerialism is implicated in 'significant social harm' for
those precarious workers caught up finding work in the such systems.

One of the big concerns in this [[managerial]{.mark} formatting of
[decision making and political discourse]{.mark} is the way in which it
**[closes off forms of public accountability]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Whiteside, for example, shows how managerialism has helped leverage the
public sector activities on financial markets in ways that conceal the
investments of the public sector and the costs of relying on private
contractors. [She captures how [managerialism has]{.mark} thus
[become]{.mark} a [key]{.mark} vehicle [for]{.mark} the [involvement of
private firms and organisation]{.mark} in the public sector and more
generally [in the process of policy making]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Similarly, concerns with accountability are central to the field of
development which, Sharma and Soederberg argue, is too often neglected
by work on managerialism. As they point out, the global risk management
agendas in the World Economic Forum (WEF) has empowered major
corporations to legitimately participate in the practices of governance
of international development. Their article documents how the rise of
risk management -- with its appearance of progress, order, and
predictability -- offers a vehicle for major firms to downplay their own
historical role in negative socio-economic trends and outcomes. In
short, they argue that the WEF discourse on risk management tends to
reproduce a harmonious and ahistorical view of the subject matter,
without adequate attention to how business seeks to replenish its
particular legitimacy within hierarchical systems of power.

[[Managerialism has]{.mark} also [fuelled]{.mark} the rise of [**a new
managerial class** that has been increasingly
influential]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Knafo, the rise of managerial
governance should be understood as a means to facilitate decision making
at the top of organizations[, for example **[in the making of
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, rather than in reference to those at the
bottom, as was the case with the Taylorist focus on restructuring the
labor process. Understood in these terms, the study of managerialism
places the emphasis squarely on the rise of [[managerial decision
makers]{.mark} and the way they [conceive]{.mark} of strategy and
[policy in managerial terms.]{.mark}]{.underline} In that regard, it is
important to realise that we may be fighting the wrong battle in
assuming that governance is currently focused on extending and
intensifying market rule in all aspects of society (c.f. Peck, 2010). As
our gaze continues to be transfixed on the market pressures that are too
often said to be driving change, we lose sight of the rise of a
managerial class that is profoundly transforming the nature of
governance and capitalist accumulation. In the process, we often
take-for-granted the script according to which managers have no real
alternative to the managerial policies they implement because of growing
market pressures. Turning the spotlight back on decision makers is
therefore key.

Together, management, **[[managerial regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Managerialism, and managerial capitalism [have '[managed' to penetrate
society so effec- tively that it warrants the term **managerial
society**]{.mark}.40 They have pro- duced a managerial system and a
managerial society without **any serious opposition**]{.underline}. But
Managerialism's reach has also extended from managerial regimes deep
into the crypto-academic subject of manage- ment studies. Management
studies have relinquished nearly all forms of critical scholarship in
order to be a functional and ideological auxil- iary.41 [[The exclusion
of an opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} under Managerialism's TINA --
there is no alternative -- [[operates]{.mark} not only in **management
studies**, but also in **managerial regimes**]{.underline}, in
managerial capitalism, and [[in **society**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today,
one might, for example, quite legitimately and perhaps even urgently
ask:42

Does the annihilation of any serious opposition to Managerialism allow,
for example, global warming, climate change, corporate envi- ronmental
vandalism, resource depletion, and the passing of peak oil to wipe out
the human race?43

[Managerialism's effort to eclipse such a possible global
catastrophe]{.underline} overshadows the search for potential causes.
[[Managerialism has **anaes- thetised** society]{.underline}]{.mark} as
the case of global warming demonstrates.44 The causes remain
unidentified, unexposed, and un-attacked because they have receded
before the all too obvious threat of Managerialism. Equally obvious is
the need for being prepared to living on the brink of environmental
destruction, to face the global environmental chal- lenge, and to
prepare for an environmentally sustainable life in a post- managerial
society.[45 But guided by Managerialism, [we still submit to the
commercial production]{.mark}]{.underline} of the means of global
destruction, to perfecting wasteful goods and services, to being trained
'for' Managerialism in what had once been 'our' school and 'our'
university, [[and]{.mark} to **[defend]{.mark} the [offenders]{.mark}**
and that which they create]{.underline}.

We can relate the causes of the danger of global warming to the way in
which Managerialism has organised and continues to organise indi-
viduals into consumers and human resources.46 By doing so, indi- viduals
are immediately confronted with the fact that society -- befallen by
Managerialism -- has become richer and perhaps even 'better' as it
perpetuates environmental devastation. Managerial capitalism makes life
easier for a greater number of people by extending the mastery of
nature. Under these circumstances, corporate mass media have little
difficulty in selling particular interests as those of all. They have
been successful in giving particular managerial interests the aura of
being universal, attaching corporate interests to truly universal
interests of humanity. Managerialism's specific needs have even been
portrayed as universal needs and aspirations. Their satisfaction
promotes business and a commonwealth deprived of any 'common' wealth in
favour of truly corporate wealth. Managerialism appeals to be the very
embodi- ment of reason. But this is no longer Enlightenment's critical
reason as envisioned by Immanuel Kant. It is management's instrumental
reason cleansed of critique.47

And yet societies under Managerialism remain irrational. Their irra-
tional quest for perpetual productivity and growth is destructive to the
development of free human faculties. It squanders human progress by the
violence of constant competition in a Hobbesian business war of bellum
omnium contra omnes. This creates not only social pathologies but also
real human casualties such as the working poor, workplace alcoholism,
mass-unemployment, poverty and misery at local, national, and global
level as found in Davis' Planet of Slums. 48 [[The managerial society's
growth depends on repression of **all options** directed towards
humanised **post-managerial** living]{.underline}]{.mark}.49 This
repression is different from the one characterising preceding and less
developed societal stages. It no longer operates from a position of
ethical and social immaturity but from a position of strength. The
ideological and material capabilities of Managerialism are immeasurably
greater than ever before. Hence, the scope of Managerialism's domination
over indi- viduals is also massively greater than ever before.

[Managerial society distinguishes itself by conquering centrifugal
social forces through technology, consumerism, and ideology]{.underline}
-- rather than terror -- and on a duality of overwhelming efficiency and
ever- increasing living standards. To investigate the roots of these
develop- ments and their historical alternatives is the aim of a
critical theory of Managerialism.50 This is a theory which analyses
Managerialism in the light of its used, unused, and abused capabilities
in order to improve the human condition. In the standards for such a
critique, value judge- ments play a part.51 The way of organising
managerial societies is meas- ured against other possible ways which
offer a better chance for alleviating the struggle of humanity for a
decent, humane, and ecolo- gically sustainable life. In other words, a
specific historical practice is measured against its own historical
alternatives. From the beginning, a critical theory of Managerialism is
confronted with the problem of his- torical objectivity.52 This is a
problem that arises at the two points where the analysis implies value
judgements:

1\. The first is the judgement that human life is worth living, can be,
and ought to be made worth living. This is the very question German
philosopher Theodor Adorno (1903--1969) asked in his mas- terpiece on
ethics, Minima Moralia: 'can there be right living in the false'?53 The
answer to his question underlies all intellectual efforts. It is the
Kantian 'what is' that is inextricably linked to 'what ought to be' as
the philosophical imperative of theory. Its rejection rejects theory
itself.

2\. The second judgement is that, in managerial societies, specific
poss- ibilities exist for the ethical and environmentally sustainable
advancement of human life. And there are specific ways of realising
these possibilities.

An analysis of Managerialism in the spirit of critical theory has to
demonstrate the objective validity of these judgements and such a
demonstration has to proceed on theoretical, ethical, and philosoph-
ical grounds. On the downside, Managerialism has available an ascer-
tainable quantity and quality of ideological and material resources. But
how, for example, has Managerialism used these resources for the optimal
development and satisfaction of human faculties reducing and eliminating
toil, suffering, and misery? Managerialism needs to be examined from the
standpoint of this and from the perspective of theory that also remains
always historical theory. History is always a realm of viable
alternatives. Therefore, among the various possible and actual modes of
organising and utilising the available resources, which ones offer the
best way for human, ethical, and environmentally sus- tainable
development? In order to identify and define possibilities for an
optimal development, critical theory must abstract from the 'actual'
organisation and utilisation of resources found in management. It must
advance to the more abstract and general levels, namely manage- ment's
prime ideology of Managerialism.

Critical abstractions refuse to accept 'the given' managerially engi-
neered universe of manufactured facts claimed to speak for them-
selves.54 In the final context of validation, such a transcending
analysis of these facts occurs in the light of Managerialism's
asphyxiated and denied possibilities. This validates the very structure
of a critical theory of Managerialism. It is opposed to the
philosophical idea of meta- physics by virtue of the rigorously
historical character of such trans- cendence. Post-managerial
possibilities must be within the reach of managerial societies. They
must have definable goals of practice. By the same token, any
abstractions from Managerialism must be expressive of an actual tendency
-- that is, their transformation must reflect non- managerially
determined needs of the underlying population. Critical theory is
concerned with those historical alternatives that haunt Managerialism
with their subversive tendencies and forces set against TINA.55 But the
values attached to such alternatives do become facts when they are
actualised into reality.

Managerialism confronts such a critique with a situation that deprives
society of its very basis. Managerial progress extends its entire system
of domination, coordination, and the treadmill of infinite com- petition
to society, thereby creating forms of existence and of power that appear
to reconcile those forces opposing Managerialism. Managerialism has
almost totally defeated, refuted, and incorporated all protest in the
name of the liberal prospects of freedom from toil. Contemporary
managerial societies and Managerialism seem to be capable of containing
social change. They have rendered obsolete any qualitative change which
would establish different institutions sup- porting a new direction of
post-managerial living and a post-managerial mode of an environmentally
sustainable existence.

[[This **containment** of social change is perhaps the single most
**impor- tant achievement** of Managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark}.56 The
general acceptance of Managerialism has been combined with the decline
of pluralism and the creation of what philosopher Herbert Marcuse
(1898--1979) once called one-dimensionality.57 Managerialism's
one-dimensionality is manifested, for example, in the initial collusion
of big business and weakened labour, however, the subsequent exclusion
of labour by its pacification through improved living standards
eliminated one of Managerialism's most dangerous opponents.58
Simultaneously, it elim- inated the second voice in economics, leaving
one-dimensionality behind. This has also occurred within deregulated
state authorities tes- tifying to the integration of opposites that has
been the result and pre- requisite of Managerialism's achievement.
Managerialism's origins evolved from the establishment of management
that really arrived at the scene during the early years of the 20th
century with two key publi- cations: Frederic Taylor's 'Scientific
Management' and Henri Fayol's 'Administration Industrielle et
Generale'.59 By contrast, Managerialism's origins date back to the
second half of the 20th century, when manage- rial writers first
elaborated on an early concept of Managerialism.60 Managerialism started
to attain concreteness in an historical mediation between ideology and
managerial practice. This historical intervention occurred in
Managerialism's awareness of the two great classes which faced each
other in society: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.61 This dates back
to 19th century liberal-capitalism when both were still two basic
classes. Since then, capitalist developments have altered the struc-
ture and function of these two classes in such a way that they no longer
appear to be agents of historical transformation. As far as still
relevant, an overriding interest in preserving the institutional status
quo unites former antagonists. [To the degree to which [**managerial
progress** assures]{.mark} the consumptive [growth and **ideological
cohesion**]{.mark} of managerial societies, [the very **idea** of
qualitative change recedes]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the absence of
demonstrable agents of qualitative social change, any critique of
Managerialism is thus thrown back. There is almost no ground left on
which critical theory and managerial practice, thought, and actions
meet. Even the most empirical analysis of historical alter- natives is
made to appear to be no more than an unrealistic specula- tion. Any
commitment to such alternatives looks like being a matter of personal
preference and youthful foolishness.

And yet, this absence fails to refute critical theory. In the face of
apparently contradictory facts, [**critical analysis** continues to
insist [that the need for **qualitative change** is as pressing as ever.
It is needed for **managerial societies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, humanity
as a whole, and for every human being. The union of growing productivity
and growing environmental destruction, Managerialism's brinkmanship of
environmental annihila- tion, and [[the **surrender** of thoughts to
managerial commands link global **human survival** to]{.mark} much
needed decision-making inside [the 'empire' of
Managerialism]{.mark}]{.underline}.62 Managerialism remains linked to
the Greek 'emporos' -- emporium -- a store selling a wide variety of
goods. It is a place of a wide variety of ideologies that make up
Managerialism and that has been able to sustain the preservation of
misery in the face of unprecedented wealth. This constitutes the most
impartial indict- ment of Managerialism. Even if this is not
Managerialism's sole raison d'être -- but a by-product -- its sweeping
rationalities of efficiency and infinite growth remain deeply
irrational.

[The fact that [the vast majority of the population has been made to
accept Managerialism]{.mark} does not render it less **irrational** and
less **repre- hensible**]{.underline}. The distinction between true and
false consciousness, real and faked interest remains meaningful. But
this distinction itself must be validated. [Human beings can find their
way from false to **true con- sciousness**, from managerially induced
false to real interest. But they will only do so once [they are in need
of **changing** the present]{.mark} environ- mentally destructive way of
life [and]{.mark} of [denying the **counterfeit positive**]{.mark}
offered by Managerialism. It is [precisely this need which Managerialism
manages to **repress**]{.mark}]{.underline} by 'delivering the goods' on
an increasingly larger irrational global scale. Managerialism and its
entourage of semi-scholarly management academics have been able to use
the scientific conquest of nature for the scientific conquest of human
beings. The mantra of management studies is not critical think- ing or
historical hermeneutics but the control of nature, markets, cor-
porations, and humans now termed human resources. Confronted with the
total character of the achievements of Managerialism, critical theory is
left with a rationale for transcending Managerialism. This vacuum fills
the theoretical structure of critical theory because critical theory was
developed during a period in which the need for refusal and subversion
was embodied in the action of effective social forces.

These categories once were oppositional concepts. They defined the
actual contradictions in 19th century European pre-managerial society.
The categories Managerialism expresses are the acute conflicts between
ethics and Managerialism. Managerialism remains antagonistic to society
and ethics. Similarly, individual, class, private, community, and family
denote spheres and forces not yet fully integrated into the man- agerial
'orbit'. The term 'orbit' best describes Managerialism's asphyxia- tion
of individuals signifying planetary movements guided by invisible forces
(Adam Smith) confined to an externally engineered perpetual treadmill of
orbiting between managerial- and consumptive regimes. Quite like
planetary movements, they too, still remain -- albeit unmen- tioned by
Managerialism -- spheres of tensions and contradictions.63 With
Managerialism's growing 'system-integrative' powers, these cate- gories
are exposed to the real danger of losing their critical connota-
tions.64 They tend to become descriptive, deceptive, and ideological. To
recapture the critical-reflective intent of these categories and to
under- stand how this intent has been cancelled by Managerialism marks a
fight against Managerialism's regressive character. Positioned against
that, critical theory joins the historical practice of a 'critique of an
ideology' as critical thought that moves from critical philosophy to
Managerialism. Jaeggi has identified the key objectives of a 'critique
of ideology':65

1\. [[Critique of ideology always means a critique of
**domination**]{.underline}]{.mark};

2\. [it is a critique of something that is **managerially made** but
made to appear **natural** and **irreducibly given**]{.underline};

3\. it is a critique of legitimising mechanisms;

4\. it sets out to highlight inner inconsistencies of Managerialism and
Managerialism's contradictions between the managerial reality and its
own ideology;

5\. it brings to light distortions in an individual's understanding of
the world and of themselves;

6\. it emphasises deformations in an individual's self-understanding as
a social entity,

7\. it is a critique of the current state of affairs understood not just
as a methodological instrument but also as part of a critical process
directed towards emancipation.

[Such [a **critique**]{.mark} results from the fact that its analysis
[is **forced to proceed** from a position 'outside' the **orbit** of
Managerialism]{.mark}]{.underline} by high- lighting Managerialism's
positive and destructive tendencies. In modern Managerialism, it is 'the
whole' that is in question.66 Just as Hegel once said 'the truth is the
whole'.67 At the same time, the posi- tion of critical theory is never
mere speculation. It must have an histor- ical position in the sense
that it must be grounded on ethical, societal, and economical
capabilities. This puzzlingly moving target still involves one more
ambiguity. The chimera of Managerialism will fluctuate between
contradictory premises:

1\. Managerialism's ideological hegemony remains capable of contain- ing
qualitative change for the foreseeable future; and

2\. there are nevertheless forces and tendencies in existence that may
break this containment, expose Managerialism, and eventually shift
managerial societies towards post-managerial environmentally sus-
tainable living.

The hegemonic ideological domination of Managerialism has made it next
to impossible to give a clear answer on which of these two options will
prevail.68 Both tendencies are there, side by side, but with the first
tendency remaining dominant. Whatever preconditions for a reversal may
exist is being used by Managerialism to prevent it. Perhaps total
environmental destruction, a sudden awareness of the seriousness of
natural resources depletion, a rapidly deteriorating envi- ronmental and
human condition, or conceivably a global weather or harvest catastrophe
may end Managerialism's domineering position.69 But unless the
recognition of what is being done and what is being pre- vented subverts
present day consciousness and the behaviour of indi- viduals, not even
an environmental catastrophe might lead to a qualitative change towards
post-managerial living.70

The findings of the present study also add to the argument that the
[[neoliberal norms are creating **unintended consequences** for]{.mark}
the [academic life]{.mark}]{.underline} such as a shift from scientific
work [to [fabrications of studies]{.mark},]{.underline} from
collegiality to [fierce competition]{.underline}, from quality education
to increasing student enrolments [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} from freedom
to [[increased surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kenny, 2017;
Macfarlane, 2020; Taberner, 2018). These [[changing circumstances are
incrementally]{.underline}]{.mark} becoming
[[embedded]{.underline}]{.mark} in the academic work patterns (Levin &
Aliyeva, 2015) but gradually eroding the crucial aspects of academic
work (Dugas et al., 2020; Lea and Stierer, 2011). In the present
analysis, [[the new]{.mark} context of the [academy seems to
support]{.mark}]{.underline} the enterprising academic who cling to
[[these new norms]{.underline}]{.mark} while creating serious
ambiguities, conundrums, conflicts and feelings of alienation for
another cohort of academics. As such, [while some]{.underline} academics
are either following or feeling pushed to [follow the neoliberal
norms]{.underline} in the academy, often at the expense of scholarly
quest and quality outcomes, [some are]{.underline} seemingly [deprived
of the support they need]{.underline} in their attempt to sustain the
core values of the profession. As some researchers indicate (Acker and
Webber, 2017; Archer, 2008a, 2008b), even [the [younger members of
academy]{.mark}]{.underline} who have directly socialized into the
current academic context expressed the felt need of collegiality,
intellectualism, truth-seeking or autonomy to exercise true academic
work. However, they also expressed how they [[felt powerless to stand
against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}
pushing them to do otherwise as they were all in weaker positions in the
academy. The present inquiry, designed as a meta-synthesis, had some
strengths and limitations. On one hand, the study made a significant
contribution to the literature through identifying and demonstrating
examples of three identity trajectories that are likely to be taken in
light of neoliberal norms. Although the results of one single,
qualitative synthesis could not be generalized for the global academy,
the study presents overarching results from a wide variety of contexts
across the globe, and thus allows for a broader understanding of current
status of academic identity making as well as inviting further debate on
this topic. On the other hand, a meta-synthesis offers cumulative
evidence and insights from the findings of published research, so the
investigation is limited to data supplied in these publications.
Although high-quality articles with rich data on identity were selected
for the present analysis, some questions still remained unanswered as
they were not addressed by these studies. For instance, future research
is needed to illuminate why academics are responding differently to
similar neoliberal institutional demands or whether academics'
agencies/subjectivities or the structural circumstances of the academy
(e.g. tenure, experience and the early socialization with their academic
advisors and communities of practice) contribute to the choice of
identity paths. These investigations would contribute to both practice
and theory in the field.

Conclusion and implications

The recent literature underpins that the [[**neoliberal initiatives**
and policies]{.mark} inevitably and [substantially **influence**]{.mark}
[the values, beliefs and]{.mark} work [patterns of
**academics**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Levin & Aliyeva, 2015). The present
study supports this argument and shows that mainly three [[identity
paths emerge]{.mark} from the juxtaposition of the neoliberalized
context of academy and the agentic endeavours of academics]{.underline}:
the enterprising, ambivalent and authentic academic identity.

As argued by several scholars based on the identity literature,
[**[academic identity is created and]{.mark} constantly
[reshaped]{.mark}** [in the social, political and cultural context of
academy]{.mark} (Fortune et al., 2016; Gardner & Willey, 2018) [but
**academics' individual choices and responses** ]{.mark}**to the
environment [make the difference]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Arasa &
Calvert, 2013; Jawitz, 2009). [Academics, in all likelihood, make these
choices based on their personal commitments and goals, their innate and
learned resources and their capacities to enact the defined
roles]{.underline} (Leisyte, 2007). As Emirbayer and Mische (1998)
contend, [the engagement of academics in making a choice from among
different possibilities of action deserves attention]{.underline}.
Although the present study revealed three identity trajectories existing
in a variety of higher education contexts in different countries, why
academics are inclined to these paths and what personal factors are
penetrating into their choices have not been clearly displayed yet. As
such, there is strong need for further studies to uncover agentic and
personal factors that shape academic identities. Personality traits,
previous learnings and experiences, socialization into the profession,
innate/learned resources, beliefs, expectations and hopes could be
considered, to name a few. Likewise, rigorous qualitative inquiries with
a sample of academics having differential professional socialization
experiences, those having worked with different doctoral advisors and
communities of practice in a variety of university contexts and academic
cultures, might help to unravel the extent to which whether it is the
structure or the personal traits determining academics' choice of
identity paths.

Impact of Managerialism on Educational Practice

[[Managerialism has had a **profound influence** on]{.underline}]{.mark}
the management and orientation of **[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}**
over the last two decades of the twentieth century, and into the
twenty-first. The impact of managerialism has not been even however,
either geographically or across educational sectors. [Its impact is
[greatest in higher education]{.mark} [where there has been a]{.mark}
global [movement to make higher education into a marketable
commodity]{.mark} that can be traded internationally]{.underline}
(Marginson, 2006). The introduction of league tables and rankings for
universities (most rankings are commercially-led by powerful publishing
interests in the media including the Times Higher Ranking and that of
Quacquarelli Symonds) has been an especially powerful tool for
generating control over universities (Marginson, 2006). [The impact of
the [**managerialist culture** is not confined to higher
education]{.mark} however]{.underline}, especially within the
English-speaking world of Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United
Kingdom. Within these countries, [[managerial practices have]{.mark}
also [been invoked at primary and secondary levels]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the introduction of local site-based [school management
and the devolution of budgetary]{.mark} [control]{.mark} to individual
schools]{.underline}. It has also involved the introduction of
performance management pay and appraisal systems and national
standardized testing of children. [[Published ranking]{.mark} of schools
[is]{.mark} also [common]{.mark}, [resulting in]{.mark} the
**[polarization]{.mark} of schools**]{.underline} (primarily on the
basis of social class) as middle class schools become over-subscribed
and 'sink' schools struggle to maintain their numbers. The impact of
these reforms on school personnel, both teaching staff and senior
management, has been substantial, [leading to [changing subjectivities
among]{.mark} both [teachers and principals]{.mark}, [as they]{.mark}
seek to [position themselves within the **new managerialist
order**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Blackmore, 2007, 2010; Lynch, Grummell and
Lyons, 2012).There is a privileging of entrepreneurial activity as
[[school leaders attempt to market their schools in line with
'**consumer' demands and interests**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A Way Forward?

[[Managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} -- at least as the orthodox account
of domination would have it -- [[is a totalizing]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [that subsumes education to its discourse]{.mark}
through what appears to be legitimate practices]{.underline} (including
the language of efficiency and quality, etc.). To find ways of
increasing space for living, rather than living within managerial
definitions of autonomy, [[**a critique is required**]{.mark} that will
not simply fall into the trap of resistance within the definitions
supplied by managerialist discourse.]{.underline} A way forward for
research is outlined in brief below.

Since power is masked as legitimate authority under orthodox accounts of
managerialism, an analysis of power is called for if the new
managerialism is to be understood. A form of power that could be
analyzed is that which Foucault (1978) calls bio-power, which presents
us with a form of bipolar technology that generates political counter
demands. It provides at the very least the possibility of a "strategic
reversibility of power relations" (Foucault 1982, p. 221). That would
provide a technology for [[contesting
managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further analyses could be introduced
from a poststructuralist perspective in which there is [now a
[rethinking of possibilities for education]{.mark}]{.underline} that
illustrates meanings as shifting, receding, fractured, incomplete,
dispersed, and deferred. There is also a Nietzschean approach to a
[[critique of managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} under which the value
of these practices is to be evaluated on the basis of their contribution
to survival and health (as metaphors for life) rather than on their
contribution to abstract notions of truth and rationality. For
Nietzsche, certain redundant metaphors for the philosophical tradition
of "self as truth" have carried over into the present as historical
remnants in the form of reified practices. The particular practices in
question within the new managerialism are those predicated upon its
underpinning assumption of its autonomous, individualistic, transparent,
and self-interested, rational individual.

These types of [[analyses of notions]{.underline}]{.mark} such as power,
life, domination, meaning, rationality, and truth suggest research into
the worth of a project [[that revalues]{.mark} the **actual value of the
new [managerialism]{.mark}** [as the governance of
**education**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Tech]{.mark}nology [conceptualizes human improvement as
limitless]{.mark} and perceives the goal of social perfectibility as
obtainable for every society]{.underline}. What exactly the perfect
society is (or what Utopia is) is determined by the particular
historical, geographical and social context from which such thought
arises. In doing all this, the theory of trusteeship equates
underdevelopment with corruption, disorder, and chaos and mismanagement
with similar negative connotations. By emphasizing these negative
aspects of life in Southern countries, [[development is successful in
legitimating its own projects]{.underline}]{.mark} in external
locations. It is through its own internal assessment criteria that
development and organizations identify the underdeveloped and how best
to tackle the poverty problem. [[A problem that has been **constructed
using its own**]{.mark} **unique [logic]{.mark}**, whilst all along
presenting itself as a thoroughly modern and scientific
project.]{.underline}

[[Modernity]{.mark} itself therefore [remains a distant and **utopian**
goal]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is never truly realized, for if it was
then there would no poverty to alleviate and development practitioners
and managers would be out of a job. But certainly, if poverty
eradication is the fundamental goal of development organizations, then
working towards redundancy is the only strategy that practitioners and
academics should be employing.

Despite Cowen and Shenton's persuasive discussion on how [[**debates
about development** need to be anchored in in-depth
understandings]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} its pre-war colonialist
philosophy, development as a discourse is presented as a homogenous and
unique set of ideas. This is problematic when attempting to incorporate
and highlight local knowledge and practices as compelling, critical, and
valued perspectives. Invariably, local knowledge and culture is
presented as assimilating modernity and all its practices without
resistance, mutations or debate. [[Managerialism]{.mark} is presented
[as totally saturating]{.mark} [every aspect of]{.mark} organizational
[life]{.mark} in the field]{.underline}, regardless of context, space
and time. That is, [[development-management discourse is]{.mark}
represented as a solid and indestructible force that is [absorbed by
every]{.mark} social [structure it touches]{.mark}]{.underline}. But is
the story of development and its colonial history quite so
straightforward?

Too often, in the last two decades, we have seemed remote, disapproving,
even highhanded. Along with many other parts of civil society, we fell
prey to abstraction and bureaucratisation in the 1990s and 2000s;
[[parts]{.mark} of the \'sector\' [were trapped in a **managerial
approach to nature**]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} in retrospect can be seen
to have **[eroded our ability to defend the common
good]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Hundreds of \'action plans\', with
thousands of targets for individual habitats and species, were created
and serviced by conservationists and government officials. The impulse
behind these plans - to make government accountable for specific actions
to protect nature - was a good one. [But when it turned out
(predictably) that [actions that required a sustained challenge to
vested interests were deemed politically unacceptable]{.mark} - and that
[managerialism was]{.mark} often **[a substitute for effective laws and
institutions]{.mark}** rather than a means to achieve them - [we made
compromises from which it was hard to recover]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
results are still visible today - for example, [in the [exploitation
of]{.mark} large parts of the [uplands]{.mark} for grouse shooting - an
activity that for the most part [benefits the very rich]{.mark}, [at
massive cost to the common good]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same moors
that working people fought to walk on a century ago are now often
deserts of eroding peat - drained, burned and keepered to sterility, and
costing all of us a fortune in water pollution and increased flood risk.
Action plans were never the answer to this problem - sustained protests
against a continuing and brazen act of appropriation probably were.

Attempts to accommodate ourselves to a prevailing utilitarian ethos
within government, by focussing on the quantification and monetising of
nature as \'ecosystem services\', also helped debase our wider
relationship with the public and politicians. We came to accept in many
of our dealings with ministers and civil servants that it was pointless
to voice the common concerns of our members and supporters - who believe
overwhelmingly that nature has a value beyond that which can be captured
in financial terms. Since the concerns of our supporters are precisely
what give us legitimacy in our dealings with government, such silences
eroded rather than enhanced our power. A lumpen and dispiriting
materialism stole into the way in which we undertook our work, and this
divided us both from our vocation and the people we claimed to
represent. One of the manifestations of such an approach can perhaps be
seen in the recent creation of a \'Natural Capital Committee\', located
in the Treasury and answering to George Osborne. According to the
government\'s National Ecosystem Assessment, properly managed ecosystem
services could deliver an extra 30 billion pounds a year to the UK
economy, whilst poor management of the same assets could cost 20
billion. Presumably, we must be happy to kiss goodbye to the plant or
animal or park or playground or mountain that doesn\'t hold its value in
this context, or finds itself outbid by the profits which might accrue
from a new office block, road or airport. As a means of deciding the
fate of the land of William Blake, John Clare and Ted Hughes, I admit
that this leaves me speechless.

Of course, [[governments]{.mark} that [are unwilling to protect
communities]{.mark}, traditions, culture [and nature from]{.mark} the
privations of [capital]{.mark}]{.underline} - and that describes most of
those during my lifetime - often find it convenient to place the
responsibility for such privations at the door of individuals. [[The
result is a politics of exhortation]{.mark}, in which we are all asked
to behave better, to make up for capital behaving worse]{.underline}.
Here, too, NGOs have been slow to challenge the underlying political
logic of such an approach - particularly where it has been used to
address the growing danger of climate change.

It is arguable that successive \'behavioural change\' initiatives to
persuade people to reduce their carbon footprint have done more to
alienate people than engage them with the problem - because too often
they have not been set in the context of a mature conversation about the
complementary roles of government and the private sector. There are a
wealth of data showing that the majority of people remain convinced of
the reality of human-induced climate change, and the need to address it;
but that they also know that individual actions on their own are
inadequate to the scale of the problem. Rationally, they expect
governments and businesses to act too. They know that boiling a bit less
water in their kettle is not going to deal with the structural
dependence of the world\'s major economies on fossil fuels.

But it must also be evident to any ordinary citizen that no government
is actually prepared to take on the vested interests that benefit from
that structural dependence. Thus, despite poll after poll showing strong
public support for more renewable and community-owned energy (including
wind and solar power), the UK economy remains largely dependent on six
large power suppliers, at least four of whom make most of their profits
from burning fossil fuels. These same companies - which are hiking their
bills at a time of falling wages and squeezed living standards - are
blaming price rises (inaccurately) on green policies while
simultaneously promoting themselves as environmental champions. It is no
wonder that people feel that current climate change policy is something
of a con.

Careless, insensitive and punitive language from environmentalists has
compounded the problem. By referring to the carbon \'debt\' that UK
citizens owe to those elsewhere in the world who have not benefitted
from fossil-fuelled industrialisation, I believe we have helped nurture
a politics of guilt and resentment, instead of a sense of solidarity in
tackling a shared problem. In the context of international co-operation,
it of course right that countries have different capacities and
responsibilities; does anyone really think that Chad, Bangladesh or
indeed India (many of whose citizens have no access to any form of
energy) should be cutting their carbon emissions at the same rate as the
United States? But as part of a dialogue with citizens in the UK, the
language of carbon debt is alienating, divisive and counter-productive.
Did we stop to think how it would feel to hear about such a debt as
someone struggling with low wages and falling living standards, in a
country where the gap between rich and poor has been growing for
decades? How would you experience such a story if you were dogged by
continual anxiety that your job was going to be outsourced to a country
that you believed had less stringent employment, health and safety and
environmental laws than your own? Looking back, I can see how it must
have felt, to be lectured on the need to tackle climate change by the
Chief Executives of businesses that were simultaneously re-locating
their offices, factories and jobs to markets with lower costs. It\'s a
wonder - and a testament to the genuine and widely held concern of
ordinary people - that the damage done to our national willingness to
reduce carbon pollution was not worse.

Re-imagining environmentalism for the common good

So, now is the time to move on. The environment movement has a vital
role to play in rebuilding the political fabric of Britain, and in
putting at its heart a relationship with land, nature and the future of
our common home. [As an essential part of this project [we must]{.mark}
also begin the work of renewing and refreshing the ways in which we
campaign on climate change]{.underline}. But first, we must remind
ourselves that if we wish to talk about the politics of place, we will
have to engage directly with the economic conditions that create such a
politics; and secondly, that if we wish to work legitimately in the new
democratic space that is opening up in Britain, [we will have to do so
through the [articulat]{.mark}ion of [shared values around the common
good]{.mark}, [not through]{.mark} a reluctant [utilitarianism
or]{.mark} an eager but **ultimately [futile

The kind of issues highlighted by Freidson about professions in general
have been taken up by those writing about the changing role of
academics, the dominant view being that the professional autonomy of
academics has been undermined by the recent changes.
[[Managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, critics argue, [is associated with
a move away from the focus on the individual professional, instead
imposing "a range of subjectivities that [encourage individuals to
behave in]{.mark} the best [interests of the
organisation]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Kolsaker 2008, p. 514). The primacy
of the organisational goals over and [**[above]{.mark}** individual
intellectual interests (ideally serving **[the greater good]{.mark}**)
and the concomitant surveillance and monitoring]{.underline} under
entrepreneurial governance structures have come under attack. Olssen
(2002) castigates managerialist reforms for the erosion of professional
academic autonomy and freedom by turning academics into 'skilled
entrepreneurs' who are expected to compete in the 'academic marketplace'
by deliberately designing courses that attract students away from those
of their colleagues. In the process, he argues, a regard for the
intellectual merits of the programme is pitted against the need to dumb
down standards and the appeal of the course to the requirements of the
market.

The [changes have also been framed in terms of the proletarianisation of
[academics]{.mark}, whose status and freedom is [becoming]{.mark} akin
to a [salaried labourer]{.mark} (]{.underline}see Halsey 1992). Stilwell
(2003) laments the manner in which [academics are increasingly being
**[commodified]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whilst Doring (2002) cautions
that academics [in their altered role are in danger of becoming
'victims' of change rather than change agents,]{.underline} with
detrimental effects on their enthusiasm for engaging with students. In a
similar vein, Morley (2003) has focused on how the language of audit
that has permeated aca- demic work transforms academics into 'hegemonic
tools' (reproducing a dominant ideology) rather than 'counter-hegemonic
agents' (challenging dominant ideolo- gies). Writing of the 'audit
explosion', Power (1997, p. 2) posits that, "[the senseless [allocation
of]{.mark} scarce [resources to surveillance activities]{.mark}" impacts
upon creative knowledge production]{.underline}. [Controlling academics
to engage in]{.underline} the monolingualism of
[managerialism]{.underline}, and keeping them "busy jumping through
artificial hoops", according to Findlow (2008, p. 325), [leaves little
time for them to challenge policy and values, and ultimately "[reduces
the role of]{.mark} the [knowledge producers in defining public
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. 326). The development of such public
knowledge is an important aspect of Freidson's (2001, p. 122) notion of
the "higher goal \[of professions\] which may reach beyond that of those
they are supposed to serve". Others have equated [academic work under
the reforms as an "academic assembly line" or "**[academic production
line]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Parker and Jary 1995). Kolsaker (2008)
spells out the [increasing control over academics' work]{.underline} in
Britain that [began with]{.underline} the requirement to record course
content and define teaching and learning outcomes, and progressed to
include the observation of teaching, explicit student feedback, and a
[research assessment exercise whereupon quantitative indicators are
mapped onto research activity]{.underline}. The most recent development
is a biennial survey requiring faculty to record their time in half-hour
slots (Kolsaker 2008).

An important point made by Musselin (2007) in response to the outcry
about the reduction in the professional power of academics is that the
[increase in control over academics]{.underline} has largely been
exercised from within their own ranks. She cites activities such as
promotional assessments, editorial board decisions, and research
assessment exercises, all of which are academic led. What she argues,
however, is that other [instruments of [regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}
have sprouted up alongside peer control, [[such as]{.mark} institutional
surveillance and **[national requirements]{.mark}** that [allow]{.mark}
others in [the **public sector to monitor** academic
work]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Musselin puts it, "\[t\]here is a great
deal of evidence that professional power often supports institutional
power ... there is a global increase in the level and intensity of
controls which are often enacted through the peer review process" (p.
6). Indeed, as we consider further on, [whilst some researchers have
found resistance to the managerial culture, others have found academics
to be positively disposed to it]{.underline}.

4.3 The Impact of Increased Managerialism on the Nature of Teaching and
Research

Whilst the application of [managerial principles]{.underline} across the
higher education sector [has implications for]{.underline} academic work
practices (as indicated earlier), it also potentially impacts upon
teaching innovation and [the type and status of knowledge developed
within disciplines]{.underline}. Indeed, it has been posited that
differences arise in terms of how knowledge is defined between the
traditional value system within higher education and that of
managerialism. As Findlow (2008, p. 318) notes:

[New [managerialism approaches knowledge as a finished product]{.mark},
packaged, positive, objective, [**externally verifiable** and]{.mark}
therefore located [outside the knower]{.mark}]{.underline}. By contrast,
an 'academic exceptionalist' ... view of knowledge places it in the
minds of knowledgeable individuals, with the holder of the knowledge
also the main agent of its transmission ... This kind of expert or
'professional knowing', closely related to conventionally acquired
'wisdom' ... is produced through an organic process between people in a
culture of nurturing new ideas. The process is allowed to take as long
as it takes, and knowledge is not seen as a finished product.

An example of how innovation in teaching is affected by managerialist
values comes from Findlow (2008) in the case of England. Enhancement of
funds for teaching and learning are made available there to address one
of the national prior- ity areas outlined by the Higher Education
Funding Council for England (HEFCE 2002); however, as Findlow (2008)
argues, the 'innovation' being funded is that deemed to be in keeping
with institutional priorities that are in effect also state priorities.
The language of managerialism ripples through the funding documentation
calls, requiring academics who respond to sell themselves and their
proposals in a similar managerialist light. Thus, Findlow argues,
'innovation' is already framed in the lexicon of efficiency and
standardisation.

In relation to the impact of managerialism on the status of knowledge
developed within disciplines, a key question is whether the application
of a managerial model, with its intensification of surveillance,
increased output control (Smeenk et al. 2009) and links with industry
[impacts upon academic freedom to create knowledge uninhibited by vested
interests]{.underline}. De Vries and Lemmens' (2006) [critical [analysis
of]{.mark} [scientific 'evidence' drew attention to]{.mark} the way in
which [studies funded by industry]{.mark} were more likely to produce
positive results about an intervention]{.underline} (or selectively omit
negative findings) compared with those funded independently of vested
interests. This problematisation of scientific knowledge---claims that
[such [knowledge]{.mark} is [socially mediated rather]{.mark} [than
epistemologically certain]{.mark}]{.underline}---has emanated from a
realm of social science scholarship referred to as the 'Strong
Programme' (see Mc- Donnell et al. 2009, p. 174) within constructivist
approaches to scientific knowl- edge. Advanced by theorists such as
Bloor (1991) and Latour (1987), the Strong Programme proposes that it is
the scientific community that decides which knowledge claims become
universal truths based on their own interests, and sets about 'proving'
whatever wisdoms they wish to reinforce. They argue that the privileged
status of scientific knowledge is culturally derived rather than
emanating from some superior method for discovering truth.

It should be noted that [the [idea of scientific knowledge as]{.mark}
essentially [a closed system consistent with]{.mark} the [dominant
knowledge system]{.mark} of the day within the scientific community is
not new]{.underline}; as far back as 1935, Fleck (\[1935\] 1979) identi-
fied this, and the problematisation of science was carried forward in
the work of Kuhn (1962). Kuhn theorised [closed systems as 'paradigms'
that [offer]{.mark}ed [a]{.mark} particular [worldview "in which
problems are selected, and]{.mark} those educated and socialised within
a [scientific community follow]{.mark} a [standard]{.mark} repertoire of
[methodologies]{.mark} and theories and, [therefore, **particular ways
of**]{.mark} **seeing and [interpreting the natural
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (McDonnell 2009, p. 173).

Thus, although the truth claims of science have for decades occupied the
work of some social scientists, the renewed categorisation of standards
of evidence that often determine success in research bids, privileging
randomised-controlled trials in the recent period, raises new issues
about the status of types of knowledge that academics are producing
under managerialist discourses. [Although evaluations of scientific
quality have remained steadfastly within the scientific community rather
than in the extra-scientific community (Enders et al., in press),
external research- [funding]{.mark} bodies [often prioritise
particular]{.mark} [areas]{.mark} of research. In effect, this
[**directs** what]{.mark} research questions get asked and what
[knowledge gets created]{.mark}]{.underline}, notwithstand- ing the fact
that, as we go on to consider, academics also find creative ways of
following their own research interests. Nonetheless, [prioritising
particular modes of inquiry [marginalises]{.mark} [other realms]{.mark}
of inquiry that are [not deemed]{.mark} to be [priorities according
to]{.mark} [the prevailing political discourses.]{.mark} In addition,
the primacy given to some methodological stances over others in bidding
for external funding [reinforces]{.mark} particular [perspectives on
what **counts as evidence**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The higher education sector has the potential to construct a range of
forms of knowledge, including subjugated knowledge; indeed, arguably the
creation of sub- jugated knowledge forms that challenge conventional
thinking and that impact on dominant societal discourses has been a key
outcome of academic freedom. The proliferation and construction of novel
methodological strategies within some disciplines has come about by a
critical analysis of conventional approaches to science. Moreover,
questions about what counts as sound knowledge or what constitutes
'evidence' have traditionally been both determined and debated in
university circles, notwithstanding that the 'outside' activities of
some academics in the past, as indicated in an earlier section, served
to build socio-technical networks that benefited their own scientific
reputation (see Musselin 2007, p. 3).

Overall, [the [implications of managerialism]{.mark} on the university
sector may be more [far-reaching]{.mark}]{.underline} than simply
regulating the work of what are believed to be work-shy academics; [the
characteristics and the type of [knowledge]{.mark} being created within
the sector may well be [regulated]{.mark}, monitored and prescribed from
outside, with far- reaching consequences for society, **[transforming
scholars into 'knowledge workers']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Musselin 2007,
p. 8).

#### Ecology is [ontological]{.underline}.

warming: present and future traumas," vol. 34\] //wdu

This conference was called Ecology, Psychoanalysis and Global Warming:
Present and Future Traumas. We considered Ecology in recognition of the
simple fact that human beings are part of and utterly dependent on
healthy and complex ecosystems and there is nothing more important than
the ecosystems we depend upon. [[Ecology is]{.mark} not just an **idea**
or a **branch** of biology, it is [a realistic approach to **seeing the
world**]{.mark}. The ecological thinking underpinning the conference
recognised that [humanity]{.mark}, all living **organisms** [and the
**non-human** world, are deeply embedded in interdependent relationships
and that the]{.mark} inter-[connection]{.mark} between living and
non-living systems [is a **fundamental reality**]{.mark}]{.underline}
which cannot be denied (Capra, 1996; Lovelock, 2000). To think
ecologically would be to place these relationships as central to our
understanding of what we mean by 'world'. And yet, such simple truths
are not necessarily obvious to all, or at least they are often ignored
in favour of the short-term gain advantages of the capitalist frame of
mind and its emphasis on financial gain of the individual whatever the
effect on the social and environmental fabric. It may be that the idea
is relatively simple, but the complexity is hard to perceive, which is
Timothy Morton's argument in describing such complexities as
'hyperobjects (Morton, 2013). In this context, therefore, the conference
considered Psychoanalysis, because [the problems that drive [ecological
disaster originate in a **human**]{.mark} **aggression** and
[**hostility** to the idea of being dependent on the ecological systems
of our shared planet]{.mark}]{.underline}, like an attack on the
Kleinian 'good breast'. Psychoanalysis, or rather a psychosocial
approach that brings individual human experience into the realm of the
shared social fabric of human systems, can help us understand the social
defences and unconscious processes at play in the earth's destruction.
[[**Global Warming** is the symptom of this '**disease**', that needs to
be 'cured']{.mark}. The 'body' of **humankind** becomes the 'body' of
the **planet**, so that [illness is interwoven and necessarily shared by
human and non-human]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is James Lovelock who
considered the world as Gaia, as a living entity. He has suggested that
the planet is 'ill' in this way (Lovelock, 2005). Whether this is
literally, figuratively, scientifically, emotionally or psychologically
true is not our direct concern in this special edition. Instead, we are
concerned about the result of whatever this illness is. On the one hand,
the result of this illness is climate change. On the other hand, [[the
result is mental disturbance and **anxiety** of the kind that has given
rise to **Extinction Rebellion**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the phenomena
of children's climate strikes and the joining forces of the very young
and the very old in the iconic figures of Greta Thunberg and David
Attenborough, who are both real and symbolic in their function and
power. [It is [surely our collective mental illness]{.mark} that
[produces the rise of temperature]{.mark} in the 'patient']{.underline}.
In this sense, humankind is mentally sick, and the planet is physically
sick. People are suffering Present Traumas as a result. Like many
others, we at the Tavistock and members of the Climate Psychology
Alliance understand that so many people are suffering today as a result
of climate change, all over the world, but mainly in the Global South.
There, war and displacement and loss are often rooted in conflict over
scare resources, as the changes in the climate challenge everyday life,
and as power takes precedence over justice. Scarce resources are stolen
from those in need and made available for the more fortunate in society,
often in the Global North. Today's refugees are victims of climate
change and these present traumas will have intergenerational resonances
throughout the generations. Future Traumas is perhaps a concern of the
privileged. Those lucky enough to live in the prosperous Global North
have the luxury of being worried about their children and
grandchildren's future. It seemed right to us at the Tavistock and
Climate Psychology Alliance as organisations concerned with the
emotional wellbeing and mental health of our community that we act in
some way, to show solidarity with those who are suffering, and to speak,
to create dialogue around these issues, with the authority, power and
privilege that we hold. Given this definition of the problem, we ask:
what kind of knowledge do we need to cope with the magnitude of the
ecological crisis that is upon us?

### Managerialism Good--- General---2AC

#### Managerialism, in its [ideal form]{.underline}, is best. That means [every push]{.underline} towards it is good.

**Shepherd \'17** \[Sue; February 13; Post-Doctoral Research Associate,
School of Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research, University of
Kent; Taylor & Francis, \"Managerialism: an ideal type,\" vol. 43\]
//wdu

An [ideal-type model of managerialism]{.underline}

[The **[ideal-type]{.mark}**]{.underline}, first developed and used by
Max Weber in relation to capitalism and bureaucracy, [[can serve as a
useful means of **synthesizing**]{.mark} and **organizing** [abstract
ideas]{.mark} in a coherent and accessible way]{.underline}. This
process inevitably necessitates a degree of selection and simplification
that fails to convey the entirety or complexity of a phenomenon.
However, an ideal type is purely an intellectual tool or heuristic
device which cannot, and should not, claim to depict reality. It is
rather an abstraction of reality, expressed in 'purest imaginable form,
almost as a caricature' (Barberis Citation2012, 331) that allows it to
capture the essential elements of a phenomenon[. [Although
**reductionist**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in nature and representing a
fixed state or point in time, [this]{.mark} very [fixity means that it
can serve as an **unchanging marker** against which to compare the
changing **empirical world**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Friedson
Citation2001). When used as a standard of comparison, [an ideal type
enables us to see the world in a clearer and more systematic
way]{.underline}.

With this aim in mind, this section presents an ideal-type theoretical
model of managerialism derived from the literature (Pollitt
Citation1990; Hood Citation1991; Farnham and Horton Citation1996; Clarke
and Newman Citation1997; Clarke, Gerwitz, and McLaughlin Citation2000;
Pollitt Citation2003; Klikauer Citation2015). It comprises five core
ideological tenets, or claims, outlined in turn below. In addition,
there is a sixth claim that applies specifically to managerialism in a
public sector context, that is, a belief in the superiority of private
sector methods. It is important to note that these tenets are normative
rather than descriptive and reflect the way things should be from a
managerial perspective rather than the way they necessarily are. This
ideal type is therefore not intended as an ideological defence of
managerialism. Instead, it is anticipated that it may serve as a focal
point for critique -- which is beyond the scope and purpose of this
article -- and as 'a clear target for criticism and revision' as a
theoretical model (Friedson Citation2001, 5).

\(1\) [Management is important and a good thing: The **fundamental
premise** of managerialism is that [management is]{.mark} both [the
optimal form of organizational governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deem,
Hillyard, and Reed Citation2007) [[and the main vehicle for
**organizational success**]{.mark}. The argument goes that, if only
things were better managed, improved performance would inevitably
follow]{.underline}. By this token, [effective management should lead to
the elimination of]{.underline} red tape and [inefficiency]{.underline},
the establishment of [**clear objectives**, a highly **motivated
workforce** and **demonstrable results**]{.underline}. To proponents of
managerialism, management is thus 'an optimistic, almost a romantic
creed' (Pollitt Citation1990, 1).

Managerialism holds that [[management is]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
important, but also a good thing: [[a progressive social force with the
capacity to solve a range of]{.mark} **economic** and **social
[ills]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More and [better management should provide
the means by which individual organizations can **thrive**]{.underline}
and the UK economy become more globally competitive and successful
(Clarke and Newman Citation1997). It is therefore indispensable to the
achievement of economic, technological and social progress (Deem,
Hillyard, and Reed Citation2007). [[Underpinning]{.underline}]{.mark}
this aspect of [[managerialism is the belief that **economic growth** is
the main route to **social prosperity**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pollitt
Citation1990).

\(2\) Management is a discrete function: In the late nineteenth century,
a new group interposed itself between owners and workers: the
supervisors responsible for the efficient running of the organization
and the maximization of profit for the shareholder owners. From this
group emerged a new cadre of trained professional managers (Ward
Citation2011). Scientific management, from which managerialism derives,
was predicated on the assumption that increased surveillance by these
managers would improve worker productivity. This would be achieved by
reducing tasks to their component parts, measuring work processes and
controlling and rewarding effort. It is an elitist view of management in
that it is based on a philosophy of separating the conception and
execution of tasks, or thinking from doing (Broadbent, Dietrich, and
Roberts Citation1997), with workers defined as unthinking and following
orders. By implication, managers are the management, that is, a group
separate from those doing the work (Flynn Citation2002) and often remote
from the day-to-day functioning of the organization. This very
remoteness supports the notion of a professional management in
possession of a generic body of knowledge sufficiently removed from the
technical specifics that it is transferable from organization to
organization (Entemann Citation1993).

The main purpose of management is seen as undertaking the strategic
decision-making that enables an organization to achieve its stated
purpose (Ranson and Stewart Citation1994). The discretion to plan and
make strategic decisions gives management its distinctive role in
organizations, whilst the requisite processes of analysis and strategic
choice have intellectualized and professionalized it (Entemann
Citation1993). Managers are able to justify themselves on the grounds of
their superior know-how, and their skills and competencies are viewed as
critical to organizational survival and success (Farnham and Horton
Citation1996). This reflects the prioritization of management as a
discrete function and the creation of a management class with real
organizational power (Lynch Citation2014).

\(3\) [[Management is **rational** and **value neutral**]{.mark}: Due to
its origins in scientific management theory, managerialism places great
faith in the management activities of planning and objective setting as
a means of improving performance]{.underline} (Farnham and Horton
Citation1996). The decision-making process that underpins these [[core
management functions is perceived as entirely **logical**]{.mark} and
rational]{.underline}: managers define the problem, gather relevant
data, develop possible solutions, evaluate them and decide on the best
course of action. [The process is also rational in the sense that the
application of]{.underline} what is regarded as superior intelligence
via [[**scientific method** is inevitably deemed to lead to **optimal
decisions**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Taylor Citation1911). By these means,
[managers are able to constantly refine and improve organizational
performance]{.underline}.

From this perspective, [[management]{.mark} practice [is]{.mark}
essentially technical and value neutral, [offering a **non-partisan**
framework within which decisions can be made away from]{.mark} the
[partisan claims]{.mark} of particular **interest groups**]{.underline}
(Clarke and Newman Citation1997). Accordingly, managers are neutral
professionals who can be trusted to manage in an impersonal way and in
the organization's best interests. Managerialism therefore holds that
organizations can only function effectively if decision-making is
centralized in the hands of professional and objective managers (Ward
Citation2011). More broadly, [the whole notion of managerialism is
presented as value neutral]{.underline} and its management principles as
unquestioned, common-sense truths (Klikauer Citation2015).

\(4\) [[Management is generic and **universally
applicable**]{.underline}]{.mark}: Managerialism also echoes scientific
management in its espousal of the systematic nature and universal
applicability of management. Taylor (Citation1911) holds that anything
can and should be managed and that management practice in one arena is
transferable to another. This approach to management theory could be
characterized as management is management regardless of where it is
practised (Kottler Citation1981). It views [management as a generic set
of activities common to all organizations]{.underline}, with managers
performing fundamentally the same tasks whatever sector they are in
(Ranson and Stewart Citation1994). For advocates of managerialism, there
is little difference between the skills required to run an oil rig or a
university (Klikauer Citation2015).

#### Managerialism is a good political strategy---enables coordination between difference which leads to politically effectual action.

**Benthall, 17** Senior research fellow at NYU Law's Information Law
Institute, research scientist at the International Computer Science
Institute (Sebatian, "Why managerialism: it's tolerant and
meritocratic", Digifesto, 11/7/2017,

//genny

In my last post, I argued that we should take managerialism seriously as
a political philosophy. A key idea in
[[managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} (as I'm trying to define it) is
that it [[acknowledges]{.mark} that [sociotech]{.mark}nical
[organizations are]{.mark} relevant [units of political]{.mark}
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, and is concerned with the relationship
between these organizations. These organizations can be functionally
specific. They can have hierarchical, non-democratic control in limited,
not totalitarian ways. They check and balance each other, probably.
Managerialism tends to think that [[organizations can be managed well,
and]{.mark} that [good management matters]{.mark},
politically.]{.underline} This is as opposed to liberalism, which is
grounded in rights of the individual, which then becomes a foundation
for democracy. It's also opposed to communitarianism, which holds the
political unit of interest to be a family unit or other small community.
I'm positioning managerialism as a more cybernetic political idea, as
well as one more adapted to present economic conditions. It may sound
odd to hear somebody argue in favor of managerialism. I'll admit that I
am doing so tentatively, to see what works and what doesn't. Given that
a significant percentage of American political thought now is
considering such baroque alternatives to liberalism as feudalism and
ethnic tribalism, perhaps because liberalism everywhere has been
hijacked by plutocracy, it may not be crazy to discuss alternatives. One
reason why somebody might be attracted to [[managerialism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that it is (I'd argue) [essentially
[**tolerant** and]{.mark} **[meritocratic]{.mark}**. Sociotechnical
[organizations]{.mark} that are organized efficiently to perform their
main function [need not make]{.mark} a lot of [demands of]{.mark} their
[members besides whatever]{.mark} protocols are [necessary for the
functioning of the whole]{.mark}]{.underline}. In many cases,
[[this]{.mark} should [lead to a]{.mark} basic [indifference to race,
gender, and class]{.mark} background]{.underline}, from the internal
perspective of the organization. As there's good research indicating
that diversity leads to greater collective intelligence in
organizations, [there's a good case for tolerant policies in managerial
institutions]{.underline}. Merit, defined relative to the needs of the
particular organization, would be the privileged personal characteristic
here. I'd like to distinguish managerialism from technocracy in the
following sense, which may be a matter of my own terminological
invention. Technocracy is the belief that experts should run the state.
It offers an expansion of centralized power.
[[Managerialism]{.underline}]{.mark} is, I want to argue, not compatible
with centralized state control. Rather, it [[recognizes]{.mark} many
[different spheres of life]{.mark}]{.underline} that nevertheless need
to be organized to be effective. These spheres or sectors will be
individually managed, perhaps by competing organizations, but [[regulate
each other]{.mark} more than they require central
regulation.]{.underline} The way these organizations can regulate each
other is Exit, in Hirschman's sense. While the ideas of Exit, Loyalty,
and Voice are most commonly used to discuss how individuals can affect
the organizations they are a part of, similar ideas can function at
higher scales of analysis, as organizations interact with each other.
Think about international trade agreements, and sanctions.

**[The main reason to support managerialism]{.underline}** is not that
it is particularly just or elegant. **[It's that it is more or less the
case that the political structures in place now are some assemblage of
sociotechnical organizations interacting with each other]{.underline}**.
Those people who have power are those with power within one or more of
these organizations. And to whatever extent there is a shared
ideological commitment among people, it is likely because a
sociotechnical organization has been turned to the effect of spreading
that ideology. This is a somewhat abstract way of saying what lots of
people say in a straightforward way all the time: that certain media
institutions are used to propagate certain ideologies. **[This
[managerialist framing is]{.mark} just intended [to abstract
away]{.mark} [from t]{.mark}he [particulars]{.mark} in order [to]{.mark}
[develop a political theory]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Managerialism Good---Solves Climate---2AC 

#### Techno-managerialism is key to solve for climate change through carbon accounting, biochar carbon offsets, and the voluntary carbon market to sustainable low-carbon pathways. There are no alternatives.

5.4 Techno-managerialism as a solution to market problems

Technocentrism is often linked to a managerial view of sustainability.
[[Managerialism relies on]{.mark} measurable and organizable [solutions
to advance a low-carbon future]{.mark}. [An example]{.mark} of this view
would be [a focus on]{.mark} greenhouse gas emission ([GHG)
calculations]{.mark} and carbon offsets [in 'managing' climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the case of carbon markets and biochar,
[managerialism is evident, for example]{.underline}, 44 [in the idea of
[carbon accounting]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is often compared to
financial accounting. An example of this view is how Puro.earth sees
carbon trading.

[[A central aspect in climate mitigation is calculating a carbon
balance]{.underline}.]{.mark} It should be standardized so that all
companies would know how much they emit and sequester carbon. When you
calculate a carbon balance there are incomes and expenses -- just like
in financial accounting. (Puro.earth, 2021)

In a similar vein, the buyers of carbon credits, such as S Group, view
their climate targets in a managerialist view. The company aims for
carbon negativity in their GHG Protocol Scope 1-2 emissions by 2025.
[[Carbon negativity will be reached with emission reductions]{.mark} and
buying carbon offsets from the voluntary carbon market, an approach
shared by virtually all businesses and organizations that are reaching
for carbon neutrality or carbon negativity.]{.underline}

[[We aim for sustainable growth]{.underline}]{.mark} ... There is a goal
to decrease our own emissions by 90% by 2025 -- this will be done by
increasing the share of renewable energy used and improving energy
efficiency, among other actions. (S Group, 2021)

The Finnish Biochar Association, while critical to the excessive
reliance of carbon offsets, emphasizes the importance of "proper
standardization" as a solution.

Businesses do not understand that the cheap offsets that they buy, they
don't necessarily have any real benefit in reality -- even if the
credits were standardized. The question is, do we want to really
standardize properly or do we just want fancy numbers on a report? (The
Finnish Biochar Association, 2021)

Finnwatch shares the managerial view, although simultaneously stating
the shortcomings of the current system.

Two of the key challenges are the varied quality of Finnish offset
projects and the problem with double counting ... A registry would evade
the latter -- the offset providers who are outside the registry wouldn't
be able to avoid double counting. This way the state would be
incentivized to take good care of \[the registry\], and they would have
an interest to accept only those \[offset providers\] who are in favor
of strict carbon sink accounting rules. (Finnwatch, 2021)

The narrative of biochar-based carbon offsets follows a similar pattern
as the larger discourse on the voluntary carbon market. [Microsoft
emphasizes [the possibilities of carbon capture by biochar and the
importance of life-cycle assessment for carbon]{.mark}. Microsoft is an
example of a buyer of carbon credits that is specifically interested in
biochar as a carbon sequestration]{.underline} technology, among other
NETs. This is linked to the company's carbon negativity claims.

[[Achieving]{.mark} our [carbon negative goal]{.mark} by 2030 [will
require more than carbon reduction]{.mark}---[Microsoft]{.mark} [must
also physically remove carbon from the atmosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}
(Microsoft, 2021)

What makes an ideal biochar project? Net negativity claims include full
life-cycle assessment; Reliable availability of sustainable feedstock
with 10-20% moisture and high lignin content; Safe and appropriate
disposal of biochar to avoid any human health hazard. (Microsoft, 2021)

[[A level of managerialism is evident across]{.mark} almost [all
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}, while it is arguably more pronounced in
some narrative formations of some of the studied actors than others. For
example, Puro.earth's view is strictly managerial -- [[highlighting the
role of the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions]{.mark} in a similar
way and precision that financial accounting is conducted: with
guidelines, frameworks, accountants, and auditors]{.underline}. Not too
dissimilar is S Group's view, although the focus on managerialism is
more implicit. Similarly, Finnwatch sees carbon offsets as measurable,
standardizable objects.

In the most extreme view, [biochar-based [carbon offsets are viewed as a
techno-managerial]{.mark} [panacea]{.mark}]{.underline}, and as
discussed above, Microsoft seems to be an example of an actor that
supports this view. A dimension of this narrative formation is a view
that emphasizes how simple the task of carbon offsetting is. For
example, Puro.earth maintains [a narrative that accentuates [how easy
the transformation towards a low-carbon future is with the help of
carbon accounting and offsets]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Carbon accounting or mathematics -- there are principles according to
which something goes up and something goes down, just like in financial
accounting ... It has been made into a bigger issue than it actually is.
(Puro.earth, 2021)

However, the question of carbon accounting is more nuanced, and it
includes a lot of uncertainties. There are currently no laws or
regulations that would direct the way in which greenhouse gas emissions
are calculated. Hence, whose standards are offset providers using?
Should buyers only acquire offsets from a market that follows certain
regulation, as opposed to buying offsets from the global market? Who is
responsible that the carbon sequestration really happens? The difficulty
of standardization and regulation is evident in Puro.earth's own
activity. Puro.earth's biochar methodology does not account for
additionality, a criterion for carbon offsets that ensures that the
biochar project would not have happened without the offset buyer or
buyers in the market (Puro.earth, n.d.). This goes against the good
offset criteria (World Bank, 2020), a baseline shared by most offset
providers.

[The [techno-managerialist discourse is an undertone in all discourse
related to biochar and the voluntary carbon market]{.mark}. It is the
dominant view that determines the way in which the entire understanding
of the challenge of planetary boundaries forms, [and through which the
humanity's low-carbon goals are framed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although
the level of techno-managerialism differs between the actors -- some are
avid supporters of carbon accounting while others are more careful --
[[there are no]{.mark} clear [counternarratives to
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This emphasizes the strength of the]{.mark}
hegemonic [narrative of a techno-managerial low-carbon pathway]{.mark}:
it seems that [this is a]{.mark} shared [view that has no
alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. The lack of alternative narratives in
this space is surprising because the data I collected in this study
included voices that I anticipated to be more critical of the mainstream
view. Without alternative narratives our view and framing of the entire
problem is restricted and reductionistic. This means that our response
will be restricted and reductionistic as well.

[**[Spotting]{.mark} global [supply chain emissions]{.mark}** [through
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}

Businesses that produce and process oil, gas, minerals, and other raw
materials are responsible for half the world's greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. [[Climate TRACE]{.underline}]{.mark} is a Google.org-funded
nonprofit coalition that [[tracks]{.mark} and analyzes]{.underline}
carbon dioxide [([CO2]{.mark}) [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} power plants, factories, controlled burns, cargo
ships, and other [human [sources using satellite imagery, infrared
imaging, and nitrogen oxide sensors.]{.mark}]{.underline} The nonprofit
intends to analyze that information with machine learning to create a
publicly accessible source of real-time emissions data. Governments and
other groups worldwide could use this independently collected data to
spot illegal polluters, verify compliance with international climate
change agreements, and manage carbon cap-and-trade markets. Climate
TRACE has published a database of 352 million GHG sources.

**[[Measuring digital carbon footprint]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The digitalization of the economy helps the environment by reducing GHG
emission. But its impact must still be measured. The manufacture of
computing devices, the raw materials used, and the energy consumed
comprise the so-called Digital Carbon Footprint, which corresponded to
2% of total global emissions in 2015 and 4% in 2020, according to Enel,
a power company that is now dedicated to green energy. Toward the goal
of measuring an organization's digital carbon footprint, Greenly's app
lets businesses from all industries do just that.

It's [[especially]{.underline}]{.mark} important to monitor carbon
footprint [[as]{.mark} the rise in [AI]{.mark} use [drives massive
increases in the use of electricity and water]{.mark} in the data
centers that power AI.]{.underline} In just a few years, it is
estimated, the power usage associated with AI will rival that of a
country such as Argentina, according to data scientist Alex de Vries,
whose analysis was published in The New York Times.

Stopping further damage

Once you know that something you're doing is creating a problem, the
next step is to do things differently. With regard to climate change,
that means developing lower-carbon energy sources and finding more
efficient ways to use the energy you generate.

Lower-carbon energy is all around us, and researchers are finding
ingenious ways to tap into it:

[[Reducing and repurposing food waste]{.underline}]{.mark}

A staggering one-third of food produced is wasted or lost, according to
United Nations estimates. This is especially tragic given that 800
million people worldwide do not have enough to eat, according to the UN
World Food Program. At the same time, agriculture and food production
are among the top contributors to GHG emission. In fact, rotting food in
landfills contributes 10% to global GHG emission, according to the UN.

New digital [[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} including digital [twins
[can]{.mark} help [rein in food waste by monitoring]{.mark} and modeling
food [freshness, extending shelf life,]{.mark} and selling food priced
more attractively close to expiration through apps]{.underline}. For
example, Freshspire is using cloud computing to reduce food waste at the
point of production, providing order management, vendor management, and
data analytics solutions that connect small and mid-sized farms with
grocery stores, restaurants, nonprofits, and other customers to whom
they can sell food that might otherwise be wasted. And an
academic-high-tech partnership at Princeton University yielded wireless
technology used to sort fruit quality to decrease the number of fruits
that are sent to the landfill.

Composting food waste once it gets to the point of spoilage and
transforming it into plant feed is a fairly simple solution that avoids
sending food to landfills. A host of startups, including Full Harvest,
Hungry Harvest, and Imperfect Produce, are deploying technology aimed at
improving the appearance of produce to meet consumer expectations,
helping to avoid it being wasted for cosmetic reasons alone.

Agricultural waste can be used for other purposes as well. Strawcture
Eco, for example, turns farm byproducts into sustainable construction
materials. (See the story of its founder Shriti Pandey in our Roads to
Renegation series of short documentary films.)

[[Solar-powered fabric]{.underline}]{.mark}

What if you could charge your phone or laptop with the shirt on your
back? A new polymer that collects solar power can be applied to
textiles, creating the possibility of shirts, pants, and other clothing
that double as mobile energy supplies.

Surfing 21st-century waterpower

[[Water droplets]{.underline}]{.mark}

There are many promising developments in harvesting energy from rain
drops. [Researchers]{.underline} from City University of Hong Kong [have
developed [a generator]{.mark} that [can turn rain]{.mark}]{.underline}
(or a leaky faucet) [[into energy at 140 volts a
drop]{.underline}]{.mark} -- enough for a single drop to briefly light
up 100 small LED bulbs. Researchers in China and the UK have developed a
technique for harvesting low-speed wind energy using anchored ionic
droplets. The method -- which taps into winds that are too weak to drive
a turbine -- could be used to power small electronic devices.

Researchers in Florida are testing how well turbines that are anchored
80 feet below the ocean's surface can capture the steady flow of the
Gulf Stream. And a new 4D-printed generator shows the potential to draw
even more power from droplets of water or other liquids.

Tidal energy

[[Tidal energy production]{.mark} has the potential to [provide vast
amounts of clean energy]{.mark},]{.underline} utilizing predictable
tidal currents through methods like tidal streams, barrages, and tidal
lagoons. The technology is in its infancy, with first projects planned
in the U.S., in Washington state and Maine. The City of Liverpool,
England, has announced plans to build the world's largest tidal power
generator on the River Mersey; it could power more than 1 million homes
for 120 years or longer.

Wave energy

[[Wave energy converters could harvest **29,500 terawatt-hours**]{.mark}
of renewable electricity from the ocean [every
year]{.mark}.]{.underline} The **[[technology is making a
comeback]{.underline}]{.mark}** after the failure of a major project in
2008. The rough waters off the coast of Aguçadoura in Northern
[Portugal]{.underline} still provide the perfect proving ground for new
wave energy converters, and the Swedish firm CorPower Ocean has just
finished testing the viability of its new 60-foot-high commercial-scale
C4 buoy generator there. Portugal is the site of another promising wave
energy technology called the Wave Roller. U.S. experiments with wave
power have been limited and cited high costs. [California]{.underline}
leadership has directed state agencies to study the technology and
report back in 2025 as to its feasibility.

[[Using carbon-storing sea creatures]{.underline}]{.mark}

Scientists at Ohio State University are among a research team zeroing in
on the virus species in the world's oceans to identify those most likely
to combat climate change by helping trap carbon dioxide in seawater.

Elevator generators

Power-generating brakes are familiar to anyone who drives an electric or
hybrid car. How about installing them on other things that stop
frequently -- like elevators? A new generation of elevator technology
incorporates regenerative drives, which produce energy when the
elevators are being lowered, particularly when they have a heavy load,
according to Propmodo. Regenerative drives can recover up to 30% of an
elevator's total energy consumption. The Empire State Building in New
York City was an early poster child for this technology, and as of 2022
claimed to host "the largest wireless battery management system in the
world."

As these articles show, one way to engage systematically with these
emerging, uncertain difficulties is through detailed ethnography of
[privileged [knowledge workers]{.mark}]{.underline} who are [[attempting
to sort out]{.mark} the demands of [the present through]{.mark} engaged,
situated [practice]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Rabinów 2008). This kind of
second-order anthropology seeks out field sites in which active work
reformulates critical nodes of existing practice. These articles are not
simply ethnographies of expertise; on the contrary, if [the people
who]{.underline} [are the focus of these studies can be called
\"experts,\" it is]{.underline} not simply because they possess a
specific form of knowledge, but [because they have put themselves in the
position of trying to act on the conditions of the present. Notably,
anyone struggling to come to terms with the specific geoecological or
sociotechnical demands placed upon them is in a privileged position to
re-theorize these conditions. To understand how these people think and
act]{.underline} - particularly [as [some]{.mark} of them [are
developing]{.mark}]{.underline} generalized [[tools such
as]{.underline}]{.mark} forestry [[carbon offsets]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Rojas 2016, this issue), [carbon [sequestration]{.mark}]{.underline}
techniques (Giinel 2016, this issue), [or carbon [accounting
databases]{.mark}]{.underline} (Whitington 2016, this issue) - [is to
investigate the actuality of relationships in which they are
invested]{.underline}.

The carbon problematic, not without risk, is - and will continue to be -
central to the political actuality of the contemporary global dynamic,
and anthropologists can play a key role in resisting what James Fleming
has called \"molecular reductionism\" (2010, 9). Rojas, working with
scientists who are attempting to establish the basis for using carbon
markets to secure forest conservation in the Amazon, argues:

\[[[Such]{.mark} market-based [projects]{.mark}\] [are **not
designed**]{.mark} to]{.underline} preserve Amazonia \"as it is,\" or to
[[transform the region according to a]{.mark} predetermined
[design]{.mark} that is [thought capable of preserving or improving
Nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Rather, this environmental approach can
work without recourse to rational claims of truth and is open to the
emergence of new socionatural worlds in crises shaped by capitalist
operations]{.underline}. (Rojas 2016, 16)

This, he argues, [emerges out of a nonnaturalist frame of reference
undertaken by the scientists themselves - some of whom have been key
protagonists in academic debates about the Anthropocene and its
implications. While some [scholars criticize policy-oriented scientists
for]{.mark} embracing a Western \"mono-naturalist\" framework that leads
them to naively place [hope in far-fetched neoliberal
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Heynen, McCarthy, Prudham, et al.
2007), Rojas points out that [[these scientists are not hopeful]{.mark}
at all]{.underline}, and the critique obscures their own critical
reflexivity. On the contrary, [[central to their non-naturalist
**ontological presuppositions** is]{.mark} the spectre of probable
widespread [human suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}.

So why should these scientists support carbon markets and other forms of
privatized environmental management? For these actors, [privatized
eco-managerialism attempts to establish de-natured, anthropogenic
conservation zones through articulated forms of fi- nance,
territoriality, and care]{.underline}. However, [these [practices do not
desire]{.mark} systems of [mastery in]{.mark} which the rationalist
[pretensions of]{.mark} [human]{.mark} agency are capable of
[redesigning nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, the [[scientists
presume]{.mark} that humanity is enmeshed in transformations it may have
initiated but which now are far outside of its control; because of the
radical transforma- tions in store**, [techno-managerialism does not
hold]{.mark}. [Human actors are simply along for the
ride]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Correlatively, the urgency of the moment
means that ecological actors need alliances with unlikely bedfellows.
Whereas scientists might prefer strong-minded conservationist
regulations, they instead put themselves in the compromised position of
forging working relations with industry, local landowners, the rural
poor, and agricultural capitalists to max- imize ecological possibility.
For example, in Rojas, one scientist argued, \"[I [don\'t think it is
legitimate to criticize]{.mark} \[carbon market forestry\] [because it
does not solve capitalism\'s problems]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (2016, 22).
In this practice of deep compromise, scientists bracket capitalism
(Riles 1998) - but in so doing, following Marilyn Strathern (1992), they
also make capital- ist relations explicit. Far from being caught in a
naive optimism in which market relations will neatly forge an
unproblematic future of green capitalism, these actors are attempting to
maximize ecological potential while coming to terms with a future in
which ecological natures are inherently, but only partly, a function of
anthropogenic atmospheres.

However, Levinas' work does not clearly provide a theme that is
straight-forwardly fit for this position. Nonetheless, I would argue
that such a way to setup the world as 'giftable' is probably best
understood as technology. One finds support for this proposition in
Levinas' (admittedly episodic) reflections on technology. In them,
[[Levinas **rejects** Heidegger's **negativity concerning modern
technology**]{.mark}**63**]{.underline} as he is unwilling to let go of
the two main promises it holds for humanity. First, a wholesale
condemnation of technology is, according to Levinas, "[forgetful of the
responsibilities to which a 'developing' humanity, more and more
numerous, calls and which, without the development of technology, could
not be fed]{.underline}" (Levinas, 1998b p. 9). In other words,
[[through technology]{.mark}, [humanity is]{.mark} supremely [able to
transform the world into nourishment]{.mark}, into matter [that can be
enjoyed]{.mark}]{.underline}64. These products of technology are
separated from the responsibility to a specific Other and can thus be
gifted to those numerous others that need it, thus providing politics
with the 'raw materials' it needs to fulfil its responsibilities.
Secondly, [[technology is secularizing]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[It
teaches us that worship of the world]{.mark},]{.underline} be it in
terms of nature, blood or place, [[only serves to obscure the alterity
and uniqueness of the Other]{.underline}]{.mark}. Technology shows us
that these 'gods' are "of the world, and therefore are things, and being
things they are nothing much" (Levinas, 2000 p. 166). Leaving behind
such idolatries, an opportunity arises by virtue of secularizing
technology: "to perceive men outside the situation in which they are
placed, and let the human face shine in all its nudity" (Levinas, 1990
p. 233). In other words, **[[technology is conducive of a just politics
in which the Other can call both politics and technology into
question65.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The [[**rapid advancement** of]{.mark} digital [tech]{.mark}nology [has
transformed society]{.mark}]{.underline} and undeniably impacted
wellbeing. With the advent of smartphones and social media, a host of
empirical articles, popular press pieces, non-fiction books, and
documentaries have highlighted the potential negative effects of
technology, such as addiction, loneliness, and depression (e.g., Alter,
2017; Twenge et al., 2018; Orlowski, 2020). While it is [[important
to]{.mark} **acknowledge** and [address the potentially detrimental
effects]{.mark} of this increasing **technological
reliance**]{.underline}, we believe that it is [[imperative that]{.mark}
researchers, [developers]{.mark}, and]{.underline} [users [embrace a
more **balanced approach** that also recognizes the **positive
potential**]{.mark} of digital technology to support
wellbeing]{.underline}. This Research Topic demonstrates a variety of
ways in which technological tools can be both designed and used to
maximize wellbeing across a range of domains. These studies collectively
emphasize a critical message: [for the most part [technology itself is
**neither good nor bad**, but how technological affordances are
**harnessed** determines their impact]{.mark} on wellbeing. While we
cannot ignore potential pitfalls, recognizing and **leveraging** the
positive potential of digital technology is a paramount
endeavor]{.underline} as technology becomes further integrated in our
lives. [Technological affordances]{.underline} (i.e., the potential
actions technology affords to its human users), particularly in the
realm of digital technology, [have evolved considerably in the past few
decades]{.underline} (Conole and Dyke, 2004; Parchoma, 2014).
[Leveraging these affordances appropriately may allow us to foster
**greater wellbeing** and more **social connection** in various
contexts]{.underline}. This approach is aligned with the perspectives of
the positive technology movement that seeks to draw on technology and
wellbeing science to optimize psychological and physical health (Riva et
al., 2012; Gaggioli et al., 2019). The articles in this issue advance
this approach by highlighting several areas in which technology may be a
force for good. Rosič et al. unveiled the positive facets of youth
digital interactions through the Digital Flourishing Scale, emphasizing
areas like connectedness and authentic self-presentation. This counters
the narrative that technology always inherently harms youth mental
health. Lee et al. introduced the concept of agentic social media use,
establishing the importance of intentional, meaningful engagement.
During the pandemic\'s enforced isolation, Heyman and Kushlev showed how
smartphones ensured sustained connections and information access.
Similarly, Petersen et al. emphasized how technology may be used to
reduce loneliness, especially in older adults, who are more prone to
isolation. Similarly, Chase et al. revealed that digital technology,
when used for social ties, has minimal negative ramifications and can
actually bolster mental health among emerging adults. Each of these
contributions provide evidence to suggest that purposeful
socially-motivated online behavior is positively associated with
indicators of wellbeing.

Many of the studies in this issue also demonstrate the [[potential
of]{.mark} digital [tech]{.mark}nology [to reach]{.mark} traditionally
**underserved** and [**marginalized** populations]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Schueller et al., 2019) by illustrating how these tools are
particularly well-suited for tailoring [culturally-sensitive
**interventions** that can impact populations across the lifespan and
around the world]{.underline}. Liu et al. explored the positive outcomes
of smartwatch use on user reciprocity through expanding users\' social
relationships and increasing their social engagement in mainland China.
Marciano and Viswanath provided evidence that certain social media
activities can enhance Swiss adolescents\' flourishing by fulfilling
their basic needs. Zhong et al. showed that internet use can be
beneficial for Chinese residents if used appropriately. Wu et al. study
also echoed the positive use of social media when coupled with strong
digital skills on the wellbeing of Chinese residents. Shi and Khoo
demonstrated the positive changes in self-disclosure and social networks
through an online health community for Chinese users with depressive
symptoms. These studies exhibit how [digital technology is a universally
impactful factor around the globe]{.underline}, especially in regard to
how it can address the need for belongingness by building avenues that
supplement social interaction. The [continued [integration of]{.mark}
**cross-cultural [perspectives]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark} and use of technology will enrich our understanding
of the positive potential of these tools]{.underline}.

One challenge with [understanding the **positive potential** of
technologies]{.underline} is that doing so [requires expertise and
content knowledge that draws from **diverse fields**---**psychology**
and **wellbeing** science]{.underline}, technology and human-computer
interaction, evaluation, and clinical methodologies---and coordination
across industry, academia, policymakers, and other invested parties. The
papers in this Research Topic emphasize this need for work that engages
interdisciplinarily and thus create frameworks and models to advance
this space. For example, Villamil and Heshmati propose an Engagement in
the Good with Technology (EGT) Framework with implications for digital
technology research and design. One research implication of the EGT
Framework is to consider not just positive or negative use, but to
understand the ratio of positive to negative interactions with
technology. Such an approach highlights that [[neither positive nor
negative use take place in **isolation**]{.mark} and each individual has
to balance the potential benefits and risks]{.underline}. Also, when
research measures both positives and negatives, it provides the
opportunity for researchers to understand the relative impact on each.
From a design perspective, EGT provides an additional design target. In
their development, [the **functionality** of technologies is considered,
not their impact. [Elevating "good" as a **design feature** may lead
to]{.mark} the development of features that can function **optimally**
with **[positive impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This interdisciplinary perspective is especially important to consider
in light of the evolving regulatory discussions around technologies. The
apparent harms of social media and possible risks of artificial
intelligence implementation present challenges for policy and
regulation. Technologies are constantly changing and regulatory
perspectives, focused on using punishments (or "sticks") to shape
technologies, will likely always lag behind technology development and
fail to motivate companies to develop better products. [A **[positive
framework]{.mark}** for technology development [could]{.mark} identify
ways to [incentivize companies]{.mark}]{.underline} (using "carrots")
[[and provide **actionable insights**]{.mark} to team with companies to
create wellbeing promoting products. Aligned with this thinking, we need
design frameworks that specify how to design for
**wellbeing**]{.underline}, like Liedgren et al. liminal design in this
Research Topic, and evaluation frameworks that help demonstrate the
success of the design.

Industry teams are traditionally not siloed by discipline in the same
way that academic teams are divided by traditional disciplines like
psychology, computer science, and public health. Interdisciplinary
journals, like this one, conferences, and projects are beginning to
create spaces to engage in this dialogue. One major challenge, however,
in deeper interdisciplinary research is ensuring that research teams
from different disciplines can engage on a research level. That is
ensuring that technologists are not merely included to "build the stuff"
that psychologists want to use to deliver their experiences or evaluate
and that psychologists are not merely included to identify clinical
areas of need or evidence-based interventions. [A truly
[**collaborative** and **transdisciplinary** approach will be

[Many [traditional environmentalists]{.mark} feel threatened by any
**critique** of the **wilderness ethic**]{.underline}, which is usually
accompanied by openness to the idea of human management of relatively
natural areas. They quite understandably worry that any dilution of a
hands-off approach to the wild will be the thin edge of a wedge
exploited by powerful economic interests determined to reopen wild areas
to logging, mining, and other forms of exploitation. [They also [argue
that our understanding of ecosystems remains too **primitive** to
support interventions]{.mark} that are likely to be
successful]{.underline}. And of course most environmentalists, myself
included, hold a deep personal attachment to the idea of wild places,
and are loath to embrace anything that might be seen to devalue them.

As global warming has accelerated the pace of observable change in
protected areas, the stewards of our wilderness face difficult choices
in the field. Should those protecting our ancient sequoias be permitted
to water them if necessary for the trees to survive a protracted
drought? Should exotic invasives be left alone to wreak devastation on
\"wilderness\" areas? Does it change our answer if the drought is caused
by man\'s greenhouse gas emissions and the invasive plants escaped from
suburban backyards? The debates over these questions among conservation
biologists have escalated steadily, and often turn on [the question of
whether the wilderness model still provides **appropriate guidance** to
those grappling with these practical questions]{.underline}.26 Although
an increasing number of scientists believe that it does not, the
wilderness model remains deeply embedded in the worldview of many who
have devoted their lives to the protection of our wildest places from
the depredations of man. The reaction of one prominent conservation
biologist is typical: \"Conservationists and citizens alike ought to be
alarmed by a scheme that replaces wild places and national parks with
domesticated landscapes containing only nonthreatening, convenient
plants and animals.\" He went on \[END PAGE 173\] to accuse the critics
of the wilderness model of painting traditional environmentalism as a
\"dysfunctional, antihuman anachronism.\"27

I believe that the defenders of the wilderness model protest too much.
[The \"[**slippery slope**\" argument ignores the ability of **policy
makers**]{.mark} and land stewards [to discriminate between
science-based **interventions**]{.mark}]{.underline} intended to
increase the health and resiliency of relatively wild places, [[and
**exploitation**]{.mark} of resources [for economic
gain]{.mark}]{.underline}. Allowing a forest ranger to save a giant
sequoia by providing supplemental water during a drought hardly opens
the door to the cutting of those trees for timber. [And [the argument
that we simply know **too little**]{.mark} to intervene successfully
[argues not for paralysis, but for **caution**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
When a human being is suffering from a poorly understood disease, the
doctor does her or his best, and [[we would never accept **ignorance**
as an excuse for **inaction**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Most fundamentally, [those who call on the movement to transcend the
wilderness ethic recognize that our most wild places are]{.underline}
physically, ecologically, and spiritually [**precious**, increasingly
**rare**, and worthy of our protection]{.underline}. As Aldo Leopold
pointed out, wilderness \"can shrink but cannot grow.\"28 All
environmentalists should work to thwart any attempt to weaken the
protections on wilderness that has already been saved (and thus were
right to oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and
should work tirelessly to protect our few areas of surviving wild lands
from encroachment and development. But this is not enough. Nature
includes the places where people are, and thus the wilderness ethic does
not tell us what to do with the 83 percent of the planet that is not
wilderness. Howard Zahniser, who campaigned tirelessly for the
Wilderness Act, argued that \"we should be guardians, not gardeners.\"
But fifty years later, the authors of the Wildlife Conservation Society
human-footprint analysis concluded that \"[[\[t\]he **global extent** of
the human footprint suggests that humans are **stewards** of nature,
whether we like it or not]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"29

### Perm---Biomimicry---2AC 

#### [Perm shields the Link]{.underline}\-\--biomimicry retools management into ecological learning rather than domination

[Because of growing [pressures on resources and the environment]{.mark},
it is increasingly [acknowledge]{.mark}d that we have to **look for
[alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the ecosystem destructing
technologies of the industrial age (cf. European Commission 2012).
Consequently, the demand for recyclable and biodegradable materials is
increasing. In the context of the European Union for instance, it is
argued that ''[in a world with growing pressures on resources and the
environment, the EU has no choice but to go for the [**transition** to a
resource-efficient]{.mark} [and ultimately **regenerative
circular**]{.mark} [**economy**'']{.mark}]{.underline} (European
Commission 2012: 1). Over the years, biomimetic approaches to technology
and innovation have increasingly received attention as such an
alternative for the ecosystem destructing technologies of the industrial
age. [Biomimicry]{.underline} or biomimetics is ''a new science that
[[studies nature's models]{.mark} and [then imitates]{.mark} or takes
inspiration from these designs and processes [to solve]{.mark} human
[problems']{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (Benyus 2002: I). Nature is
seen here as an inspiring source of knowledge---a solar cell inspired by
a leaf for instance---which enables nature-based innovations such as
recyclable and biodegradable materials. Other examples include
sustainable buildings inspired by self-cooling mounds of termites or car
design inspired by the way trees and bones optimize their strength and
materials. According to the proponents of
[**[biomimicry]{.mark}**,]{.underline} it [[introduces]{.mark} a new and
[ecosystemfriendly]{.mark} [approach to nature]{.mark}, which is [no
longer characterized by the **domination** and **exploitation** of
nature]{.mark}, [but by **learning** and
exploration.]{.mark}]{.underline} Benyus for instance argues that the
first industrial revolution is characterized by the domination and
exploitation of nature, whereas the second---biomimetical---industrial
revolution is characterized by learning from, and exploring, nature. [By
'doing it the natural way', our [tech]{.mark}nological [innovations
can]{.mark} claim to **[be better]{.mark} embedded in**, and [in harmony
with]{.mark}, the [natural **ecosystems of**]{.mark} **planet
[earth]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Benyus 2002; cf. Hawken et al. 2000). A
similar orientation can be found in McDonough and Braungart's Cradle to
Cradle approach: Rather than asking, ''How do I meet today's
environmental standards?'' designers would begin to ask, ''How do my
design decisions make sense in the overarching context of the natural
world?'' Ironically, this focus on the earth takes the green out of
green design, for following the laws of nature is simply the path to
good, high-quality design. In the natural world, the processes of each
organism in a living system contribute to the health of the whole. One
organism's waste is food for another and nutrients and energy flow
perpetually in closed-loop cycles of growth, decay and rebirth.
Understanding these regenerative qualities empowers us to recognize that
all the materials we use as designers---even highly technical, synthetic
materials---can also be seen as nutrients. [The laws of nature are the
bedrock of good design]{.underline}. And [they inform a cohesive set of
**science-based design practices**, which we call Cradle to Cradle
Design]{.underline} (McDonough & Braungart 2002). According to the
opponents of biomimicry however, the concept is so loose that one might
wonder whether it is more than a slogan forged by chemists in order to
play a role in the field of sustainability (cf. Bensaude-Vincent et al.
2002). They doubt that biomimicry is a real revolution, and wonder
whether it is able to achieve its ambitions and under which conditions.
If the current [discussion about the [potential]{.mark}ity [of
biomimicry]{.mark} as a new way of thinking and acting ecologically
[shows]{.mark}]{.underline} one thing, it is that [the
concept]{.underline} itself [and]{.underline} its [[implications]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} philosophically
**[[underdeveloped]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf. Mathews 2011). This is an
important omission, because it is possible that [[**biomimicry** is
implicitly conceptualized in ambiguous]{.mark}
[ways]{.mark}]{.underline} or in categories---technology versus nature,
discovery versus intervention, (technological) [[exploitation
versus]{.mark} (ecological) [exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so
on---[[that **hinder its own development**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
order to explore the conceptualization of biomimicry as an ecological
form of technological innovation, we critically reflect on the concept
in this article. In ''Introduction'' section, we analyze the elements
that constitute the concept of biomimicry and its philosophical origin:
nature and mimesis. We distinguish a strong and a weaker, but more
sophisticated, concept of biomimicry. In ''Two Concepts of Biomimicry''
section, we compare both concepts of biomimicry by critically reflecting
on four dimensions of the concept of biomimicry: mimesis, technology,
nature, and ethics. Two Concepts of Biomimicry Biomimicry and the
Conceptualization of Nature The first question we would like to address
concerns the way the concept of nature is presupposed in the literature
on biomimicry. During the past decades, several philosophers and
scientists have conceptualized nature in their work on biomimicry.
According to Philip Ball, consultant editor of Nature, biomimetics
''decodes and elucidates the cell's molecular machinery piece by piece''
(Ball 2001: 413); this means that nature is understood here already in a
technological way, i.e., as a machine. This idea is confirmed by the
materials chemist Julian Vincent, who conceptualizes nature as ''4
billion years' worth of R&D'' (Vincent 2001: 321). In a similar vein,
Benyus argues that [[nature ''has **already solved**]{.mark} the
[problems we are **struggling to**]{.mark} **solve''**]{.underline} in a
process of ''3.8 billion years of research and development'' (Benyus
2002. Nature is seen here as a huge R&D lab. In a historical study of
the concept of biomimicry, Bensaude-Vincent et al. even argue that
nature is seen as an engineer in biomimetic practices: ''Biologists,
chemists, physical chemists, and engineers are reunited around a common
problem: how can we create, develop, maintain and, eventually, recycle a
functional structure with optimal properties? They started to consider
nature as an artist, an incomparable engineer from whom we can learn
many lessons'' (Bensaude-Vincent et al. 2002: 2). In the literature on
biomimicry, nature is therefore seen as an engineer who is involved in
an enduring R&D program in order to solve natural problems. It is
striking that [the ambition of [biomimicry is to mimic
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that nature is in fact already
understood in technological terms---i.e., as ''natural technology''
(Vincent and Mann 2002)---[and biomimicry [as technology transfer from
nature to man]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bensaude-Vincent et al. 2002). We
encounter a first ambiguity here regarding the concept of nature. On the
one hand, the concept of nature is rooted in a technological concept of
nature: natural technology or nature as artist, tektoon, techne,
technology. On the other hand, the traditional dichotomy between nature
and technology is ignored in biomimetical approaches, or, as Ball puts
it, in biomimetical methods of technology and innovation, ''this
disparity between the natural and synthetic art of manufacture begins to
diminish'' (Ball 2001: 413). We recognize the Marxist position in this
line of thought, which argues that all human Ecological Innovation:
Biomimicry as a New Way of... 205 123 technology is embedded in nature
and therefore an expression of nature, whether it is sustainable or not.
This first ambiguity raises two questions. On the one hand, it is
questionable whether it is possible to overcome fundamental dichotomies
like the one between nature and technology, which is so deeply rooted in
our culture and reinvigorates public debates about genetic modification
in food production, human enhancement, and so on (Bensaude-Vincent et
al. 2002). On the other hand, and more important for our current
discussion, is the question of what in the end is the difference between
the first and the second industrial revolution if the disparity between
nature and technology begins to diminish? Given the claim of the
proponents of [biomimicry]{.underline} that it [entails a [new approach
to tech]{.mark}nology [and innovation]{.mark} that is [embedded
in]{.mark} [nature]{.mark} and in harmony with the natural ecosystems of
planet earth, it is at least striking that the mimicking of nature is in
fact mimicking a technological model of nature.]{.underline} The
ambiguity between nature and technology in biomimicry is not only at
stake in current research; it is also rooted in the philosophical
tradition. In his Physics, for instance, Aristotle explores the concept
of nature. Here also however, Aristotle is using examples from the
domain of the techne---the vase, the statue---to understand phusis. In
the third chapter of book three for instance, Aristotle introduces four
causes of natural beings as essential constituents of their physical
change (Aristotle 194b20--25). However, in exploring the four causes of
natural beings, he uses technological examples like the bronze of the
statue as an example of the material cause, the interval between two
notes as an example of the formal cause, the craftsman who makes the
statue as an example of the efficient cause, and exercising for the sake
of health as an example of the final cause (Aristotle 1980: 194b25--35).
This means that Aristotle's concept of nature in fact presupposes a
technological understanding of nature. This also becomes clear in
Aristotle's equation of technology with nature in his Physics. According
to Aristotle, both technology (techne) and nature (phusis) are seen as
productive (poiesis). The difference between techne and phusis is that
natural beings have the principle of their productivity in themselves,
whereas artefacts are produced by an external agent such as an artist or
engineer (Aristotle 192b8--34); techne is human production or poiesis by
an external agent and phusis is natural production or self-making
(auto-poiesis). Because both techne and phusis are rooted in poiesis,
both are essentially the same according to Aristotle (cf. Aristotle
199a10--20).1 However, the decision to think of nature in terms of
poiesis already implies that nature is understood in technological
terms, namely, in terms of its productivity or makeability (cf.
Heidegger 1999: 88). The first conclusion we can draw, therefore, is
that the identity of techne and phusis in the Aristotelian tradition can
be seen as the philosophical origin of the technological
conceptualization of nature in the literature on biomimicry. Both the
Aristotelian tradition and current biomimetic research presuppose a
technological concept of nature and are therefore incapable of
conceptualizing nature qua nature (see ''Two Concepts of Biomimicry''
section). 1 In the next section, we explore an additional argument as to
why, according to Aristotle, nature and technology are essentially the
same. 206 V. Blok, B. Gremmen 123 Biomimicry and the Conceptualization
of Mimesis We leave now for a moment the technological concept of nature
which is presupposed in Aristotle's philosophy, and turn to the way he
explicitly conceptualized the relation between techne and phusis. The
reason for this is that in Aristotle's Physics, we can also find the
classical definition of the concept of mimesis. According to Aristotle,
techne and phusis are essentially the same not only because both are
rooted in poiesis (cf. section 1.1), but also because technology mimics
nature (Aristotle 194a20--25). The techne either---on the basis of the
phusis---accomplishes or perfects what phusis is not capable of
effectuating itself, or imitates (mimeitai---mimesis) phusis (Aristotle
199a20--25). There are, therefore, two types of the technological
mimesis of nature according to Aristotle. First of all, there is the
mimetic copy or reproduction of the naturally given, which we could call
the naturalistic concept of mimicry with which we are familiar. It is,
however, important to acknowledge that Aristotle distinguishes also
another type of mimesis, which is based on the deficiency of nature.
Nature is not capable of producing or effectuating everything, and, in
this case, mimicry productively supplements the capabilities of nature
(cf. Lacoue-Labarthe 1998). Which one of both types of mimesis is used
in the literature on biomimicry and which of both types is suitable to
be used in the second---biomimetic---industrial revolution? According to
some proponents of biomimicry, [[mimicry is not the exploitation
of]{.mark} [biomaterials for technological applications, but consists in
**learning from and exploring**]{.mark} nature]{.underline} (cf. Benyus
2002). Biomimetical scientists try to ''elucidate how life creates
complex hierarchical structures, integrating many functions, to
understand chemical and physical strategies employed by living systems
in order to apply them, with suitable modifications, to the field of
technological design'' (Bensaude-Vincent et al. 2002: 2). [[Rather than
inventing]{.mark} new [tech]{.mark}nologies, [biomimicry]{.mark}
[discovers **natural processes**]{.mark} [and **applies these
processes**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} our **[tech]{.mark}**nological
**[design]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Can we claim that Benyus cum suis opt
for biomimicry as a copy or reproduction of natural processes and that
they therefore embrace the naturalistic concept of biomimicry? In fact,
we have to distinguish between a strong and a weaker concept of
biomimicry.

#### That makes more ethical technology that is adaptive and sustainable

The strong concept of biomimicry is represented by Janine Benyus. She
conceptualizes **[[biomimicry]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a naturalistic
way [[as **imitation**]{.mark} **[of nature's models]{.mark}** in order
to solve human problems]{.underline}. The main objective of biomimicry
is to ''echo'' the ideas of nature in our own lives: biomimetic
scientists ''are exploring nature's
masterpieces---[**[photosynthesis]{.mark}**, **[self-assembly]{.mark}**,
natural selection, **[self-sustaining ecosystems]{.mark}**, eyes and
ears and skin and shells, **[talking neurons]{.mark}**,
**[natural]{.mark} [medicines]{.mark}**, and more---and then copying
[these designs]{.mark} and manufacturing processes [to **solve**
]{.mark}**our own [problems]{.mark}**.]{.underline} I call their quest
biomimicry---the conscious emulation of life's genius. Innovation
inspired by nature'' (Benyus 2002: 4--5). Although mimicry is inspired
by nature, this inspiration is primarily understood as discovery and
imitation of nature and represents therefore the naturalistic concept of
mimicry that we find in Aristotle's Physics. This strong concept of
biomimicry is, according to Benyus, partly motivated by the idea that
[[nature]{.mark} is a [measure]{.mark} to judge the [**ethical
rightness** of]{.mark} [our]{.mark} [technological]{.mark} [Ecological
Innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}: Biomimicry as a New Way of... 207 123
innovations (Benyus 2002). Because [[natural
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} are assumed to be principles that
[[conduce]{.mark} to [ecological health]{.mark} and integrity
[of]{.mark} the [ecosystems]{.mark} of planet earth,]{.underline}
[biomimetic technology and innovation can claim to be ethically
right]{.underline}.2 By using the same design principles as natural
entities and systems, and by modelling our technological design on
natural principles, [[biomimicry adheres to]{.mark} a **[bioinclusive
ethics]{.mark}** that [enables us to resituate]{.mark} our technological
[design within the ecological limits]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the
biosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}: ''If we as human beings are to 'act from
within nature', as the ethos of biomimicry implies we ought, then the
requirement of recursiveness applies to us, to our agency. We must allow
our ends as well as our means, our designs, to be shaped by who and what
is out there in our environment'' (Mathews 2011: 373). In this respect,
the strong concept of [[**biomimicry** includes **nature**
as]{.underline}]{.mark} normative principle of the [**[conduciveness to
ecological health]{.mark}** and integrity as design principle, i.e. as a
standard of ecological ethics, contrary to conceptualizations of
biomimicry that exclusively look at these principles of nature in
mechanistic terms]{.underline} (we come back on this conceptualization
of biomimicry in a moment). In order to adhere to natural principles as
a normative standard of technology and design, however, mimicry has to
be understood in the strict sense of an copying or an reproduction of
nature. On the one hand, by copying or echoing the design principles of
nature, our technological innovations can claim to be more 'natural' and
to be more 'adaptive' to the capacities of the biosphere (Benyus 2002).
On the other hand, our [biomimetic [designs]{.mark} [can only claim to
be **ethically advantageous** if they **really** have copied these
natural principles]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, because
biomimicry is understood in the strong sense as copy or reproduction of
natural processes, Benyus cum suis [can [claim]{.mark} [biomimicry to be
**bioinclusive** and **ethically 'right**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3\. A Life-Centered Economics

[[What does a reframing of economics look like]{.mark}?]{.underline} For
one thing, it cannot step into the trap of using the same language as
neoliberalism (though below I will explicitly argue with neoliberalism's
precepts). To do so implicitly, according to George Lakoff, means
adopting the perspective that is being countered \[25\]. Table 1 offers
a framework for an economics paradigm that supports life in all
respects, drawn from a wide range of sources as noted. I believe these
precepts and principles enhance and support Raworth's 'doughnut
economics' \[26\], the life-centered approach advocated by David Korten
\[27\], circular and ecological economics, and many of the other
innovations offered by authors cited (plus, most likely, many more).

It is clear that the realistic memes associated with economics that
supports all of life are inherently more complex than the simplistic
(yet highly resonant) memes associated with neoliberalism. Consistent
with and complimentary to Raworth's doughnut economics, which offers
both a geophysical and social foundation for thinking about who and what
economics needs to accomplish \[26\], [[these reframed economic
assumptions recognize]{.mark} integral [human connectedness with]{.mark}
[the natural]{.mark} environment in community with each
other]{.underline}. Like Raworth's framework, which defines a core set
of social foundations below which wellbeing evaporates for humans, and
like Felber's idea of creating an economy for the common good \[31\],
[this approach [takes a whole system]{.mark}, [complexity-based
perspective on economics]{.mark} rather than the more
linear]{.underline} (albeit mathematically sophisticated) [approach of
neoliberalism]{.underline}. Further, [[this approach recognizes the
inherent 'wickedness']{.underline}]{.mark} \[88--90\] and complexity
\[79\] (and associated unpredictability) [[of the problems humankind is
facing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Neoliberalism fails to take complexity,
with its inherent uncertainty, into account \[1\], never mind the
'wickedness' \[88,91\] of socioecological problems \[92,93\].

[This [reframing adopts ways of seeing the]{.mark} roles, [purposes, and
practices of businesses and economics systemically in the
socio-ecological context]{.mark} in which they are integrally embedded,
[rather than]{.mark} assuming that business is [separate]{.mark} and
apart from societies and from nature]{.underline}. These values imply a
different mindset, which Meadows pointed out in her seminal paper on
leverage points for system change \[6\], is the most powerful change
lever. [The needed mindset shift shapes new, or actually, in some ways
very ancient, ideas based in part on Indigenous wisdom and values of
relationship, responsibility, reciprocity, and
redistribution]{.underline} \[48,51\]. This mindset is more expansive
and based in systems thinking, so understands the nature of complex
adaptive systems, wicked problems, and human nature. It also
incorporates core values common across all societies, hence it is more
realistic in its assumptions about the nature of the real world, how
people actually behave, and what they value (e.g., \[94,95\]).

4\. Systemic Economic Memes, Precepts, and Values: Countering
Neoliberalism

Below I unpack the memes and ideas identified in Table 1, countering
neoliberalism's flawed or problematic memes, precepts, and assumptions,
and articulating key assumptions that guided the development of the
economic framework presented above. Summarized, [[there are six key
economic precepts that support **economies that support life**:
Stewardship of the whole; co-creation of collective value; governance
though cosmopolitan-localism; regenerativity, reciprocity, and
circularity; relationship and connectedness; and equitable markets and
trade]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of course, because all of these elements
exist in complex systems (with wicked problems inherent to them), they
are interrelated and cannot fully be teased apart.

[and species extinction]{.mark} \[123\], [**humanity may not be able to
wait** for the long term]{.mark} to resolve the issues created by
today's dominant paradigm]{.underline}.

The ideas presented above, synthesized from many sources fully support
approaches like Raworth's 'doughnut economics,' Felber's 'economics for
the common good,' and ecological economics, among other descriptors of
life-centered economics. [[This set of six precepts]{.mark}, in a sense,
[models the core]{.mark} or primacy [of an economics that allows humans
to manage our planetary household better]{.mark}]{.underline} (just as
neoliberalism emphasizes the primacy of markets). They demonstrate that
there indeed is an alternative to neoliberalism. [Co-creating [economics
that supports all of life needs to be a **priority sooner rather than
later** to cope with the world's ills]{.mark}]{.underline} (or what John
Ruskin once called 'illth' as opposed to wealth[). [It is time for this
shift to occur---**before it is too late**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Some
might quibble about the details of the economic framework presented
above, but the overall thrust of the six precepts is holistic, grounded
in principles that give life and vibrancy to systems]{.underline}, and
based on the complexly wicked realities of the socioecological world
that we live in, and draws from numerous good thinkers. Yes, these ideas
are a bit more complex than the simplistic memes of neoliberalism---that
is because they rest on realistic assumptions about the nature of human
beings and of nature itself. To deny that reality is to deny the
possibility to affirm life. While [neoliberalism's tenets]{.underline}
are simple and clear, they [are also highly problematic in ignoring the
realities of the world, particularly as they have evolved over the last
decades. It is time for that to change[. It is time for an economics
that affirms life]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Economic precepts that affirm life support the whole system---and all
living beings in that system]{.underline}. While certainly there are
limits---to population growth for one thing and to resource extraction
for another---those limits do not have to mean scarcity. Rather,
[drawing from nature, we can see economics supporting abundance. [Values
well beyond monetary values]{.mark}]{.underline}---values of connection,
care, and interdependence, values of peace and shared prosperity, values
of collaboration not constant competition and war, [[values emphasizing
sufficiency]{.mark} and enough [rather than]{.mark}]{.underline} more of
what the English poet William Wordsworth called [["getting and
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}" in his poem 'The World Is Too Much With
Us.' Economics can support wholeness---integrity in all its multiple
meanings of oneness (with nature and self and even spirit), wholeness
rather than fragmentation, and, indeed, honesty and truthfulness. Will
it be easy to transform the economics paradigm to a life-centered one
like the one offered here? Probably not. Will it be worth it? That is
for the reader to answer.

### Alt fails---degrowth---2AC

Grab cards from the Capitalism K for more on this question.

#### Degrowth fails -- their evidence is theoretical and can't account for how the world actually functions

**Driscoll, 24** Assistant professor in UVA's Department of Sociology
(Daniel, "Four Problems for the Degrowth Movement", Jacobin, 2/23/2024,
https://jacobin.com/2024/02/degrowth-movement-problems-climate-change)
//genny

1\. [[Degrowth]{.mark} often **[confuses correlation for
causation]{.mark} and overextrapolates from the past.**]{.underline}

The strength of the degrowth movement comes from accurately recounting
how wealthy countries developed through the use of fossil fuels. Fossil
fuels and economies coevolved together: coal powered the earliest
factories in the Industrial Revolution. Electricity then lit, connected,
and expanded cities around the world. Oil and gas knit the post--World
War II world economy together.

Economic growth, then, went hand in hand with the growth of emissions.
The degrowth movement argues that while switching to green growth may be
theoretically possible, sufficiently rapid decarbonization requires
degrowth.

[The focus on growth]{.underline}, however, [may lead to confusing
correlation for causation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} at worst
[distorting our policy priorities]{.underline}. Therefore, an elementary
reminder is in order: [[carbon emissions come from burning
carbon]{.mark} --- [they are CO2 emissions, not GDP
emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline} To decarbonize, we need to replace
carbon energy sources with clean energy, and [[**repressing growth will
not solve** the problem of financing electrification]{.mark} and
energy-input replacement.]{.underline}

This point may seem obvious, but many people seem to forget it and focus
too narrowly on economic growth and GDP (which is of course a
controversial indicator of well-being). Growth is contingent upon energy
input, but that energy does not need to come from carbon.
[[Those]{.mark} [who argue]{.mark} that [decoupling]{.mark} emissions
from GDP [cannot happen fast enough are extrapolating]{.mark} from the
historic association of emissions and growth.]{.underline} If historical
trends routinely and straightforwardly predicted our economic future,
then much of the risk that we know to be endemic to the stock market and
the financial sector would not exist, as the past would be a sure guide
to what's coming next.

2\. [[Degrowth doesn't acknowledge that redistribution can drive
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Degrowth requires political suppression of consumption and production.
To offset the massive income reductions this would entail for poorer
populations, many degrowth experts argue that this decrease in
production and consumption should be accompanied by wealth
redistribution.

At first glance, that proposal looks reasonable --- we can decrease
emissions and inequality at the same time. But [[simultaneously]{.mark}
[reducing growth and redistributing]{.mark} resources [is not]{.mark} so
[simple]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Redistribution]{.mark} to lower income
groups or populations]{.underline} who have a higher propensity to spend
[[can]{.mark} actually [increase]{.mark} household [consumption]{.mark},
[which]{.mark}]{.underline} all other things equal [[may]{.mark} in turn
[increase emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Redistribution]{.underline} is a worthy goal, but [on its own it will
not decarbonize the economy]{.underline}. Some nuanced degrowth writing
focuses loss prescriptions on wealthier residents within rich countries
and rich countries overall. This is sensible, but it ignores the
emissions that are likely to come with emerging market economy (EME)
development in countries like India. It also ignores the recoil of
investment in EMEs that would result from reductions in consumption and
growth in wealthy countries, which would tend to bring excess capital
back home to the richer countries.

Degrowth advocates might argue that these problems could be addressed
through national and global planning regimes, which could (e.g.)
restrain households from increasing consumption too much and force
capital to invest more in poorer countries. But [[the kind of
state]{.mark} [planning required]{.mark} to mitigate emissions and
regulate behavior while reducing overall production and consumption
[would need to be]{.mark} a [globally coercive]{.mark} regime, [with
**otherworldly institutional capacities and
knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Imagine the surveillance and
punishment apparatuses needed to constantly monitor people around the
world to enforce production and consumption quotas.]{.underline} Few
would voluntarily agree to this system; governments now are not even
following through on relatively modest climate accords. Maybe a
sacrifice of democratic governance would be worth it, as some have
argued. But even if an authoritarian regime of global planning were
justified, what social forces would have the capacity to institute one?

To be clear, this isn't an objection to planning per se. To address the
climate crisis, we clearly need a big dose of democratic economic
planning that prioritizes ecological goals over profit. But
[[large-scale planning becomes]{.mark} both more [technically and
morally fraught when it involves forcing]{.mark} most of [the
world]{.mark}'s population [to accept lower living
standards.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Historically[, industrial transformations have required growth, and
relatively [lower growth in]{.mark} the context of such [transformations
has led to horrific casualties]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., the Soviet
Union's creation of famine in Ukraine during its industrialization drive
in the early 1930s). [Lower growth means more trade-offs and losses in a
transition, meaning that new capital formation comes at the cost of
greater suppression of consumption and thus of living
standards.]{.underline}

This is because the new capital needed to transition has to come from
somewhere. It can come from reallocating resources from traditional
growth sectors (e.g., from agriculture to industry) or from a rising
tide of growth that can improve the living standards of the majority.
Therefore, [[a **global investment boom is necessary** to pay for
decarb]{.mark}onization --- not a decline in investment]{.underline}, as
many degrowth advocates claim.

3\. [[Degrowth adopts unjustified assumptions from orthodox
economics.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Degrowth has a lot in common with carbon-tax advocacy. Carbon-tax
supporters, like degrowthers, have advocated decreases in consumption as
the way to decarbonization.

This approach has not gone well historically. The French government
imposed carbon taxes without offering adequate substitutes for citizens
(such as affordable electric vehicless or sufficient public
transportation options); as a result, living costs increased for
lower-income households who spent larger shares of their budgets on
energy, and eventually widespread social unrest resulted.

The truth is that [a narrow emphasis on reducing consumption is deeply
rooted in orthodox economics.]{.underline} An orthodox economics
perspective would claim that we must decrease consumption to decrease
emissions. This outlook tries to predict the future by holding variables
in the present constant. It assumes that resources and worker
productivity are always being maximized and also that energy unit costs
will not decrease.

[Those are false assumptions: resource utilization, productivity, and
energy costs change a great deal. Resource utilization can become more
efficient over time]{.underline}; think about how small computers have
become since the 1980s thanks to increasingly powerful microchips.
Productivity and efficiency constantly vary. Why else would firms share
information and techniques with each other in order to improve
themselves on those measures? And energy costs can also decrease ---
look at the recent collapse in the price of solar.

This means that decarbonization through decreased consumption may not be
necessary. In fact, carrots [([economic gains) have had]{.mark}
[more]{.mark} political [success]{.mark} historically
[than]{.mark}]{.underline} sticks (economic [[losses]{.underline}) [when
implementing climate policies.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Decarbonization will likely require massive investment. By the most
sophisticated measures, [global [decarb]{.mark}onization [will
cost]{.mark} roughly [\$4 trillion per annum]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
**[[some version of state-led green growth is probably our best
route.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Such investment on a smaller scale is
already increasing the availability of carbon-free substitutes in the
United States and China. [Degrowthers often focus too much on economic
suppression when we need to acknowledge that [electrification, energy
replacement, and economic justice may require one last]{.mark} economic
[boom]{.mark}.]{.underline}

4\. [[Degrowth doesn't have an adequate theory of]{.mark} political
[transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

From the radical social reorganization of the Paris Commune to the
policy outcomes that followed the civil rights movement, historians and
social scientists have studied the conditions that lead to successful
political transformation. To explain movement strengths or weaknesses
and predict or evaluate movement successes and failures, many scholars
will plug a movement into what they call a "political opportunity
structure." A political opportunity structure has three components: (1)
public consciousness, (2) organizational or mobilizing strength, and (3)
macro political opportunities.

What is the political opportunity structure of the degrowth movement?
Despite academic chatter, [the [degrowth]{.mark} movement [is]{.mark}
[irrelevant]{.mark} to most people in the world]{.underline}. To get a
pulse of public opinion, I [[compare]{.underline}]{.mark}d [[Google
searches of]{.mark} "[degrowth" versus "how to get
rich."]{.mark}]{.underline}

\*IMAGE OMITTED\*

Not only do [most people prioritize growth and prosperity]{.underline}
over addressing climate change (as discussed throughout), but [most
people also do not know or care about degrowth. **The [degrowth]{.mark}
movement [fails in the arena of public consciousness]{.mark}** in both
opinion and salience.]{.underline}

Things look even more dire when examining other aspects of the
movement's political opportunity structure. [[There is no major]{.mark}
social movement organization or [institution centering degrowth]{.mark}
in its platform]{.underline}. If such organizations do exist, they have
feeble resources and networks, which are key ingredients for movement
success. The civil rights movement, for instance, boasted black
colleges, churches, and activist organizations (the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the
Congress of Racial Equality) tied together through strong networks and
alliances. [Degrowth has no natural constituency, and creating it would
require a global-scale transformation of political
consciousness.]{.underline}

Finally, [the [macro]{.mark} political [conditions]{.mark} to support
the movement [are not present]{.mark}.]{.underline} [There are no
political regimes interested in advancing the movement]{.underline}. Not
even the European Union, arguably the international bloc most committed
to decarbonization right now, is interested in degrowth. At the "Beyond
Growth" Conference, European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen
stated, "A growth model centered on fossil fuels is simply obsolete" and
called for "a different growth model that is sustainable far into the
future." She's talking about green growth, not degrowth.

Furthermore, studies find again and again that [[democracies prioritize
economic prosperity]{.mark} over real decarbonization]{.underline}.
[Economic growth can enhance people's quality of life]{.underline}
(barring wars, or the trend of wealth concentration outpacing growth
that Thomas Piketty has documented). [National [governments are
legitimized by growth]{.mark}, [and when they fail]{.mark} to provide
it, [there are]{.mark} political [consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Alt fails---debate space/ballot not key 

#### **The impacts of one, or even multiple, round on the state of military managerialism is negligible, especially within the academy**

**Feldman, 22** Associate professor at Stockholm University's Department
of Economic History and International Relations (Jonathan Michael, The
Prelude to the Ukraine Crisis: Military Managerialism and the Limits to
the Institutional Discourse, The Global Teach-In, 2/22/2022,
https://www.globalteachin.com/uncategorized/the-prelude-to-the-ukraine-crisis-military-managerialism-and-the-limits-to-the-institutional-discourse)
//genny

[The Limits to Institutional Discourse]{.underline}

The problem with the liberal formulation that promotes neutrality as a
solution is that [[the **mere advocacy**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} such [an
idea **is hardly a solution** to military
managerialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Ideas do not]{.underline}]{.mark}
easily [[compete with material realities]{.underline},]{.mark} without
creating alternative material realities. Consider the case of NATO's
expansion during the Clinton Administration. Robert W. Rauchhaus
illustrates that military managerialism was part of the support system
for such expansion, although he downplays the role of
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark} contractors in his essay, "Explaining NATO
Enlargement." Rauchhaus writes, "it is clear that key figures in the
Clinton administration favoured the enlargement of NATO prior to, and
independent of, the pressures brought to bear by key domestic groups."
These groups included "the arms industry" which "did actively lobby the
administration and Congress," but Rauchhaus say "their efforts did not
seem to have much effect." Nevertheless, continues Rauchhaus "while
organized domestic interests may not explain why the policy enjoyed
widespread support, they do help explain why policy-makers who were
otherwise indifferent towards the policy decided not to stand in its
way."

Rauchhaus favors statist explanations for the expansion, summarizing one
key argument by Charles Kupchan as follows: "One of the key players who
helped advance the policy was Anthony Lake, the national security
adviser during the first Clinton administration. Lake was also joined by
several proponents of the policy, including Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Holbrooke and, later on, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott. Although in the minority, this group of enlargement supporters
was able to overcome widespread bureaucratic opposition by encouraging
the President to issue public statements about the future of NATO and
eastern Europe." In reviewing these key [[figures]{.underline}]{.mark}
we see a strong [[overlap]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[mainstream academic
institutions]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Lake attended]{.underline}
[Harvard]{.underline} [and]{.underline} did further study at
[Princeton]{.underline} University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs (which has been renamed the Princeton School of
Public and International Affairs). [Holbrooke attended
Brown]{.underline} University and was later a fellow at the Wilson
School. [Talbott attended Yale University and Oxford]{.underline}
University (when Bill Clinton was also in residence there), and later
headed the Brookings Institution (2002-2017). To a certain extent,
**[[universities have been incubators for war
planners.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

These elite institutions each represent various circulation points for
elite consensus, although Brown University has recently developed a
Costs of War Project which involves elements of anti-militarism. Wilson
School researchers were even linked to a Nobel Peace Prize to abolish
nuclear weapons. Yet, none of these institutions are known for
generating research that systematically opposes the U.S. military
industrial complex, promoting civilian conversion of defense industries
or any program of systemic demilitarization. Opposition to nuclear war
does nothing to prevent the arms sales and interventions that trigger
nuclear expansionism. A recent review by this author of literature on
economic conversion did not identify a single scholar at such
institutions (with the exception to the rule being Seymour Melman at
Columbia University and his colleagues), probably because [[elite
universities]{.underline}]{.mark} like Harvard have championed a dual
use approach which [[back]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[defense industrial
policy and]{.mark} support for [military]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological
[development]{.mark}.]{.underline} While Wilson alumnus Ralph Nader
clearly qualifies as a leading voice against militarism and Ivy League
institutions like Columbia University once championed systemic
anti-militarization, one can safely conclude that **[[there are no
academic programs based on]{.mark} the core idea of anti-militarism and
[demilitarization]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Ivy League universities.
[[There are no "departments of anti-militarist
studies"]{.mark}]{.underline} anywhere in the English-speaking world.
There are various academic departments embracing "Critical Security
Studies," but such institutions are not generating the leadership of
U.S. military and foreign policy bureaucracies. [**[The deconstruction
of militarism does not]{.mark}** necessarily **[lead to strategies which
actual hinder military managerialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The larger
point that is most relevant has been made by Institute for Policy
Studies founders Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnet: Taking a hard,
military line has often been most useful for advancing the careers of
foreign policy bureaucrats, where advocating peace and long-term, more
peaceful measures has often been detrimental. Raskin championed a
comprehensive treaty for general and complete disarmament and did not
simply deconstruct militarism. His ideas have not really circulated
within critical security studies circles.

### Heidegger

#### Heidegger's Nazism is inseparable from his conception of humans in his philosophy

**Rockmore \'92** (Tom -- Professor and former Chairman in the
Department of Philosophy @ Duquesne University, \"On Heidegger\'s Nazism
and Philosophy\", 1992, University of California Press,
https://doi.org/10.2307/2939065//phs-maubu)

Heidegger\'s Nazism and the Limits of His Philosophy

[[Heidegger\'s Nazism and]{.mark} the [failure to confront it
are]{.mark} philosophically [significant for Heidegger\'s
philosophy]{.mark}]{.underline}, for its reception, and for philosophy
itself. At a time when some are still concerned to deny the existence of
the Holocaust, in effect to deny that Nazism was Nazism, and many still
deny that Nazism had a more than tangential appeal to one of the most
significant theories of this century, [merely to assert the
philosophical significance of an abject philosophical failure to seize
the historical moment for the German Volk and Being is not likely to win
the day]{.underline}. Yet there is something absurd, even grotesque
about the conjunction of the statement that Heidegger is an important,
even a great philosopher, perhaps one of the few seminal thinkers in the
history of the tradition, with the realization that he, like many of his
followers, entirely failed, in fact failed in the most dismal manner, to
grasp or even to confront Nazism. If philosophy is its time captured in
thought, and if Heidegger and his epigones have basically failed to
grasp their epoch, can we avoid the conclusion that they have also
failed this test, failed as philosophers?

Since even those thinkers who hold that we need to begin again, to begin
from the beginning, rely on a reading of the history of the
philosophical tradition, **[[philosophy is inseparable from its
past]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If philosophy is a historical discipline,
then it is unavoidably under obligation to come to grips with what has
come before in order to progress. Yet it is significant that after some
twenty-five hundred years of practice, there are no widely accepted
standards as to how to judge prior philosophical views. In the absence
of clear guidelines, [we can measure the failure of Heidegger and some
of his students to come to grips with Nazism in his thought or even with
Nazism as it existed]{.underline}, parenthetically like so many other
philosophers and academics in general, against the idea of the
philosophical pursuit offered by the philosophers themselves.

At the dawn of the Western tradition, a flattering view of philosophy
was formulated as the ultimate source of truth and social goodness, as
the only way to know in an ultimate sense and as indispensable for the
good life. The question of what philosophy can know finds a partial
response in an assessment of what Heidegger in fact knew and what he
claimed to know. He claimed to know how to go about arriving at an
authentic thought of Being, and perhaps how to think Being, as well as
to be able to interpret the present and even the future through
Jünger\'s reading of Nietzsche\'s philosophy. At the end of the Second
World War, he foresaw difficult times ahead; but by then he was scarcely
alone in that perception. He was also hardly isolated in his initial
enthusiasm for Nazism as the express route to German greatness, a
misapprehension widely shared by the literati---among them candidates
for the title of master thinker, heirs to the great German philosophical
tradition in our time---and the illiterati, the uneducated, many of whom
were equally mistaken about the prospects of the Nazi movement. It is
sobering to realize, [[despite Heidegger\'s claims as a philosophical
seer]{.mark}, a prophet of Being, that [his theory was]{.mark} of
[no]{.mark} comparative [advantage when it came time to confront the
present]{.mark} and to foresee its consequences]{.underline}. Although
Heidegger reacted against nihilism as early as the rectoral address, in
the same talk he publicly threw in his lot with a leading example of
nihilism in our troubled century.

There is an old view that the thinker needs to preserve a distance, to
be alienated from reality in order to know it. Supposedly, it is because
one is distant from what one wants to know, not caught up within it,
that objectivity becomes possible; out of the distance one is
paradoxically nearer to what one seeks to know. Similarly, [Heidegger
insists in his own way that the thinker needs to withdraw, to be oneself
alone, in order to be able to know Being]{.underline}. Yet if we
discount bad faith as an explanation, in which case anything is
possible, Heidegger genuinely did not seem to know, never seemed to
recognize, that there was something absolutely new about Nazism, which
made it different in kind from, and for that reason literally
incomparable with, anything else. Here and there one can point to a
word, even a sentence in his wider corpus, that perhaps indicates an
obscure awareness of the problem. But even to allow this kind of
interpretative license, in order retrospectively to isolate in
Heidegger\'s voluminous writings a passage or two in his works that
might charitably be read as showing a minimal sensitivity to the issues,
is in effect to confirm the essential poverty of his understanding of
the entire Nazi phenomenon.

[[The problem posed by Nazism is]{.mark} a human problem in [the most
basic meaning of the term \"human]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} It is widely
known that [[Nazism posed a]{.mark} decisive [threat to values]{.mark},
to human beings, to the democratic form of life, to the idea of human
[and racial equality]{.mark}, to concepts of mutual
tolerance]{.underline}---in short, was a menace to the small advances of
human beings concerned to realize, as Hegel put it, the idea of freedom.
Heidegger either could not understand or was unconcerned with the
problem posed by Nazism to human beings since he consistently offered
the main role to Being. [[Heidegger\'s philosophy is **rooted in his
antihumanistic subordination of human being to Being**]{.mark}, to which
he subordinated his own entire life]{.underline}, and to which his
students on occasion seem willing to subordinate themselves and others
in the increasingly unavailing effort to excuse Heidegger the
philosopher and sometimes even Heidegger the man. Heidegger\'s
understanding of the problem of Being required him to reject values and
anything linked to value as incompatible with thought in the deepest
sense, which is limited to contemplation of the idea of Being. According
to Heidegger, any concept of value is inextricably linked to the
philosophies of the worldview which are philosophy in name only, since
they fall below the genuine thought necessary to think Being.

It is often said by Heidegger\'s supporters that his later thought is a
confrontation with Nazism. Heidegger himself makes this claim more than
once. It is also possible that Heidegger\'s claim expressed his deep
conviction and not merely what it was convenient to state, that it was
not finally a statement of what the many in their unwisdom desired to
hear from him. Heidegger may sincerely have believed that he was
confronting Nazism. But he did not and could not since his thought of
Being, as he understood it, required him to turn away from human values
and human being. Yet Nazism\'s threat to human values and human beings
cannot be usefully understood through the lens provided by technology or
even inauthentic metaphysics. The reason why Heidegger\'s critique of
Nazism is limited precisely and solely to its philosophical status, its
character as a Weltanschauung that falls short of philosophy as he
conceives it, is that this is the only aspect of the problem which falls
within the domain of \"philosophy\" or authentic thought as Heidegger
understood it. In a position that puts Being before human being, and
argues that Being is literally the only question, there is literally no
way to differentiate the extermination of people in gas chambers from
agricultural technology. As his statement of this point makes clear,
Heidegger\'s position simply does not possess the conceptual resources
necessary for this end. If to name reality is the paramount
philosophical task, Heidegger\'s thought suffers from its paradoxical
incapacity, despite its emphasis on concreteness, to do so.

[[Heidegger\'s]{.mark} philosophical [insight is accompanied by]{.mark}
a pervasive **[blindness]{.mark}** to what perhaps is visible to almost
everyone,]{.underline} with the possible exception of those rare
individuals who at this late date continue to deny the existence or the
importance of the Holocaust. A novel philosophical position offers a
perspective that uncovers whole new regions of thought, vast domains
that become salient through the formulation of new ideas that
circumscribe and give meaning to regions they literally render visible.
Heidegger\'s thought, as he repeatedly emphasized, was limited to the
single task of thinking Being. In Heidegger\'s wake, a whole cottage
industry of philosophers has arisen who share his view that Being is the
central question of the discipline. But the same perspective that has
uncovered the problem of Being for our time also conceals while it
reveals, covering up from view what for most of us is so starkly
visible. It is difficult to know what is more important: Heidegger\'s
insight in uncovering Being or his blindness to Nazism which lay
concealed to his ontological gaze.

[[Heidegger\'s embarrassment reflects the limits of his
thought]{.underline}]{.mark}. A painter might reasonably be expected to
focus on painting and all that pertains to it, as would a literary
critic with literary topics. An issue such as Nazism falls outside the
immediate ken of painting or literary criticism. Yet it would be
surprising if either a painter or a literary critic not only did not but
in fact could not find a way to evoke the most significant example of
moral and political evil in this century. If philosophy were peculiarly
handicapped in this regard, we would need to think seriously about what
we could expect from the love of wisdom. Fortunately, this strange
forgetfulness has not afflicted the entire community or even very many
among us. Heidegger objected to the forgetfulness of Being
(Seinsvergessenheit ). [Yet if attention to Nazism is the criterion, [he
is the only major thinker]{.mark} who seems [to suffer]{.mark} in a
serious, incurable way [from]{.mark} an even more important lapse of
memory: [the forgetfulness of human being]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Menschensvergessenheit ). One need not hold that philosophy is as rigid
and unconnected with reality as schizophrenia\[20\] to conclude that
something is basically amiss in philosophy if a major representative
neither notices nor can notice the series of issues raised by Nazism.

Heidegger\'s claim for the significance of his thought is based on the
idea that in Being he has uncovered the forgotten, central question of
philosophy. Yet Heidegger\'s approach to metaphysics is preferable to
others, such as those defended in our time by Kant and Hegel, only if we
accept it as normative. His view of Being is an illustration of the
contemporary thought of Being, more precisely the contemporary reading
of what he regarded as the recapturing of the original insight into
Being. But there is a difficulty in Heidegger\'s inability to engage the
contemporary epoch in a more direct way. The Socratic view of philosophy
is intended to respond to the felt need to examine life. But
Heidegger\'s position fails the Socratic test since, despite its
frequently repeated claims about insight into concrete human being, life
is merely a secondary theme that must inevitably be sacrificed for a
deeper concern.

Heidegger later realized that his thought required him to reject not
only Cartesianism but Platonism in all its forms. But we need to
reaffirm the value of the Socratic stress on critical thought about
human existence. A lesson of the behavior of intellectuals in this
century is that it is too easy to invoke mitigating circumstances in
which intellectuals account for the abandonment of the critical
intellectual role, such as the supposed political incompetence of
philosophers.\[21\] What an intellectual of any kind needs to do,
including a philosopher, even in difficult circumstances, is to
contribute to separating the intellectual wheat from the rhetorical
chaff, to continue, as philosophers have always done, to separate good
arguments from bad ones. In his thought, Heidegger claimed to be
critical with respect to a tradition that covered up and hence served to
obscure genuine insights about Being. [[We]{.mark} in turn [need to be
critical]{.mark} about this claim in order to judge it on its merits
since [not to]{.mark} do so is to [contribute to the consequences of
this thought]{.mark}, albeit unwillingly, [and to abnegate our
intellectual responsibility]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What we can hope for from philosophy depends as much on the way we
exercise our intellectual responsibility as on philosophy itself. It is
becoming ever clearer, if it was not clear already, that philosophy is
not what it seems and seems to be what it is not and cannot be. Despite
the flattering image of their discipline which philosophers have long
presented, it is not in itself a source of perfect knowledge, nor
intrinsically linked with virtue. It is merely one way among others,
with no particular cognitive privilege of any obvious kind, to
contribute to the truth and perhaps to serve the good.\[22\]

Despite the urging of others in the discussion, [[we cannot]{.mark}
simply [turn away from Heidegger\'s]{.mark} turn to
[Nazism]{.mark}---that is, not [if we still desire to understand his
thought]{.mark}]{.underline}. Heidegger obscurely held that his thought
went back behind the distinction of theory and practice,\[23\] although
he continued to insist even in his later position on the political
relevance of his thought[. Yet Heidegger\'s view of thought as retaining
the relevance of pure theory, which satisfies our desire to know,
nonetheless falls below the standard supposedly ingredient in all the
other sciences: the human good]{.underline}. For even if we accept the
idea of a good for the German people, a good that is one only for them
is obviously not the general human good. And how are we to make out the
claim that the question of Being is the central question of human
history?
