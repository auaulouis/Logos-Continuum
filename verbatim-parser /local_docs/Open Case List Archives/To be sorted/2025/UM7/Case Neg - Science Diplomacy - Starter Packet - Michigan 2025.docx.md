she said. "[T[he Russian government does not want Russian scientists to

US-Russia peace talks: What consequences for Arctic research?

While gathered around a table at the University of Washington Arctic
research networking event, I asked one colleague originally from Russia
what they thought the US-Russia "peace" talks ongoing in Saudi Arabia
might spell for Arctic research. They noted that [a resolution
to]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine]{.underline} under the current
circumstances [would prove devastating to freedom of speech, academia,
and civil society in Russia]{.underline}. Trump, they said, was
completely vindicating Putin. Russian news networks now show clips from
Fox TV that exonerate the Russian war criminal. Should the war end, his
grip on domestic society will only tighten. With so many of their young
men dying on the battlefield, Russians badly need and want the fight to
have been a worthy one.

[[US researchers might technically be able to return to Russia if
relations are "normalized."]{.underline}]{.mark} They may even be able
to use their Visa and Mastercards during their travels, because that's
precisely what hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians have
died for. Priceless sacrifices, indeed.

[But]{.underline} my colleague emphasized that [[many American
universities would likely still not permit sponsored travel to
Russia]{.mark}, [making it impossible]{.mark} to go as part of a funded
and insured work trip]{.underline}. [[While Russian archives are open,
it's not safe to access them since the Kremlin has deemed any research
that is even remotely critical a danger to the
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Russian researchers]{.mark}, too, often
[fear any form of communication with foreigners]{.mark}, let alone
collaboration, [lest they be seen as colluding with the
enemy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The environment for academic freedom in Russia is lethal.
Researchers]{.underline}, journalists, and activists [face jail time for
any misstep]{.underline}. Their counterparts in the US do not face these
sort of threats. Yet they are reckoning with loss of livelihood,
meaning, and public acceptance. This means that Arctic research in not
just one major Arctic state, but two, risks annihilation.

[Another issue that was raised was the question of]{.underline}
incentive or [motivation for Russia to "rejoin" the Arctic

Assembly increasingly used the language of "Arctic Seven" and
"like-minded Arctic nations". [[Russia's focus on the economic

[[overshadowed any shared commitments to environmental

[With the current slate of sanctions and mutual hostility, [Russia's

[One of the worrying signs that some academics shared is the exclusion
of Russia and the Russian Arctic from the western research
agenda,]{.underline} [as non-security-related research will likely
diminish in importance and fundability]{.underline}. Identified were the
deeply challenging fieldwork conditions in Russia for [non-Russian
scientists]{.underline}, who [could face dramatic consequences for
relatively insubstantial reasons, and [Russian scientists]{.mark}, who
[face oppressive review and restrictions over publishing results related
to the Russian Arctic, even those evincing low levels of sensitivity at
a national security leve]{.mark}]{.underline}[l]{.mark}. Whether
research on Russia continues to receive support from Western scientific
funding and policy bodies remains to be seen, but [[the
near-impossibility of conducting fieldwork for many may drive a shift in
research]{.mark} and funding priorities]{.underline}.

Though Russia's real approach to the environment may tell a different
story, [[Putin]{.mark} did devote time to climate concerns]{.underline}
in the same speech --- albeit only after blaming the West for the
breakdown in cooperation. He spoke of preserving the Arctic's "unique
natural environment," called for "environmentally friendly
technologies," [and [proposed a new research center to monitor the
effects of climate change --- not to curb them, but to guide

The [Trump]{.underline} administration, meanwhile, for all its talk
about the Arctic's strategic importance, [has slashed funding for NOAA
and other agencies with Arctic research programs --- and made broader
cuts to climate science.]{.underline} That research isn't just about
protecting the environment; it also provides critical information for
operating in it, like sea ice forecasts. "In the shorter term \[the
cuts\] may not have such very clear effects," Moe told Meduza. "But it's
a long-term problem --- [the administration is cutting off the
possibility for long-term involvement and investments."]{.underline}

Indeed, [[while politically the environment might be the easiest
arena]{.mark} for the U.S. and Russia [to revive Arctic cooperation,
it's not clear that either administration actually plans to start

### 1nc -- thaw inevitable

Global temperature rises have led to a rapid increase in permafrost
temperatures around the world, and this has caused fast-expanding
permafrost thawing especially in the Northern Hemisphere (Biskaborn et
al. 2019). [The [degradation of]{.mark} the [permafrost]{.mark} system
[has been dramatic]{.mark} between the 1970s and 2018]{.underline} for
example in the Western Russian Arctic (Vasiliev et al. 2020). [This
[thawing]{.mark} of the permafrost [has **already passed a tipping
point** and will continue **for hundreds of years** even if the emission
of greenhouse gases]{.mark} by humans [were **immediately
halted**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Randers & Goluke 2020). [The
[methane]{.mark} and other greenhouse gases that [the Arctic thawing is
now releasing will further accelerate this]{.mark} process, making
developments in the near decades unstable for an assumed continuation of
extraction]{.underline}. Scientists have warned that this process will
be further increased as there are very few signs of decreasing
emissions; instead the focus has shifted toward net-zero targets in the
distant future and dubious offsetting schemes and other false solutions
to address the climate crisis (e.g.
https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/12/11/10-myths-net-zero-targets-carbonoffsetting-
busted/). The potential of carbon that will be emitted from permafrost
thawing is massive, estimates running from 260 to 360 billion tonnes of
carbon, a considerable part of which will thaw abruptly and not
gradually, these abrupt emissions greatly increasing the release
projections (Merritt et al. 2019). Just a tiny fraction of this emission
potential would have catastrophic impacts (Smith 2011).

### 1nc -- no runaway warming

#### No risk of permafrost tipping points

**National Science Foundation**, 20**20** -- press release "Warming
Climate unlikely to cause major methane release" 2/28,
<https://www.nsf.gov/news/warming-climate-unlikely-cause-major-methane>
//DH

[A long-feared scenario in which global warming causes Arctic permafrost
to melt and release enough methane]{.underline}---a potent greenhouse
gas\--[to]{.underline} accelerate warming and [cause
catastrophe]{.underline} probably **[won\'t happen]{.underline}**.

[That is the conclusion of a study]{.underline} appearing in the journal
Science [that]{.underline} began more than 20 years ago as a query posed
by Jeff Severinghaus, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. A National Science Foundation-funded research team led by
the University of Rochester\'s Vas Petrenko that includes Severinghaus
[analyzed samples of gases trapped in ice during a period of
deglaciation between 18,000 and 8,000 years ago. That period
is]{.underline} considered [a partial analog for]{.underline} the
[current]{.underline} era of [global warming.]{.underline}

The [researchers conclude that even if methane is released]{.underline}
from permafrost and other stores known as methane hydrates, **[very
little]{.underline}** [actually reaches the atmosphere.]{.underline}

\"It is a rare piece of good news about climate change,\" said
Severinghaus, \"so I\'m happy to come to the public and say [this is
something we don\'t have to worry about]{.underline}.\"

Severinghaus said the study is bolstered by its reliance on a definitive
source of data. [Measurements of the carbon-14 isotope are considered a
reliable and unambiguous indicator of permafrost and hydrate
methane]{.underline}. Because carbon-14 has a half-life of some 5,730
years, much older carbon from permafrost and hydrate deposits contains
virtually no carbon-14.

When plants die, they decompose into carbon-based organic matter in the
soil. In extremely cold conditions, the carbon in the organic matter
becomes trapped by permafrost---frozen ground\--instead of being emitted
into the atmosphere. Permafrost is mostly found on land, mainly in
Siberia, Alaska, and Northern Canada.

Along with organic carbon, there is also an abundance of ice in
permafrost. When the permafrost thaws with rising temperatures, the ice
melts and the underlying soil becomes waterlogged, helping to create
low-oxygen conditions. That creates an ideal environment for microbes in
the soil to consume the carbon and produce methane.

### 2nc -- no runaway warming

#### Sea level rise contains the bulk of methane release

M. N. **Dyonisius** et al, 20**20** - Department of Earth and
Environmental Sciences, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY "Old
carbon reservoirs were not important in the deglacial methane budget"
Science, v. 367 N. 6480, 2/21,
<https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax0504> //DH

In contrast to old carbon reservoirs, contemporaneous CH4 sources such
as wetlands and biomass burning emit CH4 with a 14C signature that
reflects the contemporaneous Δ14CO2 at the time (15). Our Δ14CH4
measurements for the OD-B transition are all within 1σ uncertainty of
the contemporaneous atmospheric Δ14CO2 (19) (Fig. 1A), indicating a
dominant role of contemporaneous CH4 sources. We used a one-box model
(see section 4.2 of the materials and methods) (20) to calculate the
amount of 14C-free CH4 emission into the atmosphere (Table 1, fig. S9,
and table S10) (20). Our box model shows that the total 14C-free CH4
emissions during the OD-B transition were small \[on average, \<13
teragrams (Tg) of CH4 per year, 95% CI upper limit\]. Combined with
earlier Δ14CH4 data from the YD-PB transition (15), [our results argue
strongly against the hypothesis regarding old carbon reservoirs being
important contributors to the rapid CH4 increases associated with abrupt
warming events]{.underline} (Dansgaard--Oeschger events) (9). [This
conclusion is consistent with previous studies]{.underline} (13) showing
no major enrichment in the CH4 deuterium/hydrogen ratio (δD-CH4)
concurrent with the abrupt CH4 transitions (CH4 from marine hydrates is
relatively enriched in δD). It has been shown that [even at a relatively
shallow water depth]{.underline} of \~30 m, \~90% of the 14C-free [CH4
released from thawing subsea permafrost was oxidized in the water
column]{.underline} (21). We hypothesize that during the OD-B
transition, relatively **[rapid sea-level rise]{.underline}** associated
with meltwater pulse 1-A (17), [combined with CH4 oxidation in the water
column]{.underline} (22), [may have prevented CH4 emissions from
disintegrating marine hydrates and sub-sea permafrost from reaching the
atmosphere]{.underline}.

Our measurements of 14CH4 during the Bølling--Allerød interstadial
(14.45 to 13 ka BP) and the early Holocene (10 to 8 ka BP) warm period
(Fig. 1A) provide an opportunity to assess the likelihood of delayed CH4
emissions from old carbon reservoirs in response to warming. The onset
of marine hydrate dissociation might lag the initial warming signal on
decadal (23), centennial, or even millennial (18) time scales.
Permafrost degradation could also lag a warming signal on decadal and
centennial time scales (24) depending on local environmental conditions
such as permafrost depth, soil types, and moisture content (4). [During
parts of the early Holocene, Arctic temperatures were likely warmer than
today]{.underline} (25), [providing a good analog for Arctic conditions
in the coming decades]{.underline}. Proxy reconstructions of thermokarst
lake initiation (11) and land permafrost degradation (10, 24) suggested
a potential increase of CH4 emissions from these processes during both
the Bølling--Allerød interstadial and the early Holocene warm period.
However[, our]{.underline} Δ14CH4 [measurements]{.underline} (Fig. 1A
and Table 1) [show **no evidence** of delayed]{.underline} 14C-free [CH4
emissions after warming]{.underline}. [These results are consistent with
present-day observations that carbon from thermokarst lakes and
permafrost is predominantly emitted in the form of CO2 rather than
CH4]{.underline} (4, 26), and that CH4 emissions from permafrost systems
are dominated by relatively contemporaneous carbon (26, 27).

Because carbon stored in permafrost is not expected to be 14C free (28),
we also attempted to use our 14CH4 results to calculate the possible
magnitude of CH4 emissions from thawing old carbon in permafrost
(Section 4.3) (20). This calculation assumed that the 14C activity of
permafrost CH4 emissions follows the predepositional age of terrigenous
biomarkers released from thawing permafrost (7500 ± 2500 years old
relative to our sample age) (10). Resulting CH4 emissions from old
permafrost carbon range from 0 to 53 Tg CH4 per year (table S10) (20)
throughout the last deglaciation and may have contributed up to 27% of
the total CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (95% CI upper limit) at the
end of the OD-B transition (14.42 ka BP). However, we consider this
calculation speculative (see section 4.3 of the materials and methods)
(20).

When the global sea level was lower, exposure of continental shelves may
have resulted in higher CH4 emissions from natural geologic seeps (29).
A recent study also inferred the existence of CH4 hydrate deposits
underneath ice sheets and suggested that the proglacial meltwater
discharge is likely an important source of CH4 to the atmosphere (5).
Ice sheet retreat during the last deglaciation may have destabilized the
subglacial hydrate deposits, which contain old, 14C-depleted CH4.
However, our data, which span most of the deglacial ice retreat and
sea-level rise (Fig. 1F), argue strongly against both hypotheses. The
14C-free [CH4 emissions were small throughout the last
deglaciation]{.underline} (Table 1) [and appear to be insensitive to
both global sea level and ice volume]{.underline}.

#### Arctic zombie viruses won't spread

The unstoppable spread of a zombie virus

In the 2002 film "28 Days Later," it takes less than a month for the
virus responsible for "zombifying" the public to traverse the world. But
[[would a "zombie virus" of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} variety
necessarily [[wreck]{.underline}]{.mark} this
[[havoc]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Simply put, [**[no.]{.underline}** [Viruses have variable
infectiousness, and there are myriad barriers that]{.underline}]{.mark}
[can [stop]{.mark} them from successfully
[spreading.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The most obvious is
geographical]{.mark} -- a virus needs a host to climb a mountain or
cross an ocean,]{.underline} and without one, [[its capacity for spread
is limited]{.underline}]{.mark}. But a pathogen may be unsuccessful in
spreading a disease even when it is able to come into contact with a
host. Disease susceptibility is an elusive concept, a complex
calculation balancing genetics, environment, target demographic of the
disease, medical history, living and working conditions, and more. Most
importantly, [[not all viruses are able to infect
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. In April of last year, [[researchers
isolated strains of defrosted "Methuselah microbes" which are]{.mark}
indeed [virulent]{.mark} -- but [only to amoebae.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The bottom line is that [being exposed to a disease does not
automatically lead to infection]{.underline}. Diseases are
extinguishable in ways that the Hollywood zombie is not.

The inevitable doom of another pandemic

Between its sudden emergence and frenetic spread, the zombie -- much
like the frozen virus -- conjures a sense of doom. Yet [we have reason
to be hopeful about our ability to defeat a "zombie virus."]{.underline}

[[The last century has seen remarkable growth in human
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} against outbreaks.
[Vaccination,]{.underline} for example, [has been]{.underline} nothing
short of [a public health miracle.]{.underline} The World Health
Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization has "saved 154 million
lives over the past 50 years." Between 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19
vaccine is estimated to have prevented at least 19.8 million deaths
globally. That level of [success is particularly remarkable given that
[it took less than a year from the first sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2
genome to the first emergency authorization of its
vaccine.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The world's current capability to address outbreaks of]{.mark}
infectious [disease is historically unprecedented]{.mark}, and we should
not mistake a virus' ability to spread and cause illness as tantamount
to a pandemic]{.underline}. As frightening as zombies may be, their
viral counterparts need not cause the same type of fear.

CONCLUSIONS

Currently available data indicate that there is no increased risk of
human viral pathogen emergence from permafrost compared to other
environmental sources. We do not claim that viral pathogens in
permafrost pose zero risk or that surveillance of putative viral
pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary. However, [[there is]{.mark}
currently **[no evidence]{.mark}** that [human or animal viral pathogens
frozen in permafrost pose an imminent disease outbreak
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Though climate change is accelerating
thaw, [the entry of microbes from ancient permafrost]{.mark} into the
modern environment [is not]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[new]{.underline}]{.mark} phenomenon. [[Permafrost is continually and
naturally exposed to the modern environment]{.mark} by processes such as
erosion, cryoturbation, frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and climate
fluctuations]{.underline} (151--153). [[Humans have been in the Arctic
for more than 40,000 years]{.underline}]{.mark} (Alaska up to 25,000
years and Scandinavia \~5,000 to 12,000 years) (154--156). This suggests
that [[people are and have been regularly exposed to viruses]{.mark}
from permafrost soils, [with no clear evidence for]{.mark} large-scale
health [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### 2nc -- no zombie viruses

#### No unique risk of permafrost viruses -- soil viruses can't spread to humans or animals

[The theoretical risk posed by permafrost viruses]{.underline} [with
microbial hosts]{.underline} to human populations [can be evaluated by
exploring]{.underline} the origin and evolution of pathogenic viruses
and examining [whether there is precedent for microbial viruses spilling
over to humans or animals.]{.underline} Host jumps between closely
related species are common at evolutionary timescales; 61% of human
pathogens and 75% of emerging human pathogens have zoonotic origins
(122). [[The likelihood of successful host jumping decreases as the
phylogenetic distance between hosts increases]{.underline}]{.mark}
(123--125). Viruses bind specifically to molecules on the host cell
surface, rely on the host's cellular machinery for replication, and must
evade the host's immune system (126--128). As a result, they are
typically highly adapted to specific hosts and can only "work" in hosts
with similar molecular pathways (129, 130). [[Given the large
phylogenetic distance between soil microbes and humans, such a shift
would be]{.mark} extraordinarily unlikely, if not
**[impossible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Investigating the origins of human pathogenic viruses shows that
microorganisms are not a source of spillovers. The majority of zoonotic
viruses (\>80%) are from mammals, while the remaining \~20% are
primarily from birds (87, 124, 131, 132). Instances of viruses infecting
both humans and other vertebrates, such as reptiles, are rare (131, 133,
134). Non-zoonotic viruses, such as papillomaviruses and herpesviruses,
which are host specific, offer insights into potential host jumps in the
more distant past. For these viruses, the host phylogenetic tree roughly
mirrors the viral phylogenetic tree (135--137). For example, human
papillomaviruses are most closely related to papillomaviruses with
non-human primate hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between viruses
increases with evolutionary distance between hosts (136, 138, 139).
These evolutionary relationships can largely be attributed to
co-speciation between virus and host and occasional instances of
interspecies virus transfer (135, 137, 140). However, there is no
evidence to support a microbial origin for these viruses (135, 137, 139,
141, 142).

[[The lack of precedent for microbial viruses jumping to human or animal
hosts suggests this]{.mark} scenario [is unlikely to arise from thawing
permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Humans are **constantly**
exposed to an enormous diversity of viruses]{.mark} from the
environment.]{.underline} Viruses are crucial members of all Earth's
ecosystems (143), and soils are perhaps the largest viral reservoir on
Earth (144). In some soils, viral abundance can exceed more than one
billion per gram, and similar counts are found per gram of human
intestinal content (144--146). [[Billions of viruses can be swallowed
during a swim in the sea]{.underline}]{.mark} (147, 148). [Despite this
constant bombardment, [there is no indication that microbe-infecting
viruses represent a major disease risk]{.mark} for humans, wildlife, or
domestic animals]{.underline} (87). Research, surveillance, and
prevention strategies aimed at mitigating the risk and impact of future
pandemics do not identify these viruses as potential threats (90, 149,
150). [[There is no reason to think that viruses from permafrost
represent a greater risk for spillover]{.mark} than viruses maintained
in other environments such as temperate soils and aquatic
systems]{.underline}.

The unexpected rise of an unknown disease

In the 2013 film World War Z, Brad Pitt's character is stuck in traffic
-- a gridlock that seems normal until its cause is revealed to be the
outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. Within the first ten minutes of the
film, the zombies' rise turns the world upside down. Our inability to
predict their resurrection is one of the aspects that makes these
viruses so fearsome. In the words of infectious disease researcher
Jeremy Farrar, "if you don't see \[it\], you will always respond too
late."

But [[we are already learning how to expect these kinds of
viruses.]{.underline} [The International Circumpolar
Surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} (ICS) [[program operates in eight
countries, creating a network of hospitals, laboratories, and public
health officials that monitor health status]{.mark} and report cases of
concern. The program]{.underline}, which started in 1999, [is a
"successful example of collaborative surveillance]{.underline},"
supplemented by national disease tracking units run by individual member
states. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, for example,
[operates the Arctic Investigations Program that coordinates with tribal
communities to "evaluate...infectious threats that may be climate
sensitive]{.underline}." These efforts are also supported by the
International Health Regulations, a recently-amended treaty that
outlines surveillance, notification, and verification steps its 196
member states are bound to follow.

Birgitte Annie **Hansen**, 20**25** -- reporter. "Arctic Council Working
Groups Must Persist Despite Putin and Trump, Says Researcher" High North
News, 5/28,
<https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/arctic-council-working-groups-must-persist-despite-putin-and-trump-says-researcher>
//DH

One of the Arctic Council\'s six Working Groups, the Arctic Monitoring
and Assessment Programme (AMAP), recently released its Arctic Climate
Change Update 2024, summarizing key trends and impacts on the Arctic
climate.

Sadly, [the Arctic]{.underline} region [continues its downward spiral in
terms of climate]{.underline}. The report shows that extreme weather
events, wildfires, melting ice, and ocean acidification have become the
new normal in the Arctic. In fact, the negative developments are
speeding up.

The report presents proposals for action to counteract this development;
however, **[[gaining political traction has become]{.mark} increasingly
[difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the past decade.

\"While [the [Arctic Council Working Groups **do not have**]{.mark}
**much [political influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[today]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is important that they carry out their
work and function as an agenda-setting body,\" says Svein Vigeland
Rottem, Researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, to HNN.

\"There will come a time after Trump and Putin.\"

Enough research, more action

In recent years, many have argued that **[[there is sufficient
research]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the impacts of Arctic climate change;
[[what is]{.mark} really [needed is action]{.mark}]{.underline} by
decision-makers. Yet, [[in the current political landscape,]{.mark} the
multilateral climate [action needed in the Arctic is
**far-fetched**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

After the Ukraine War, all scientific cooperation with Russia was
discontinued. The Arctic Council\'s work was temporarily paused in March
2022. Since February 2024, the council\'s working groups have resumed
official meetings in digital format, while meetings at the diplomatic
and political levels have remained paused.

The council has primarily focused on surviving after Russia\'s
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and has only recently managed to start
looking toward the future.

On the other side of the Atlantic, US President Donald [[Trump]{.mark}
has [launched his own attack on science through mass firings, cuts in
funding, and limitations to research]{.mark}]{.underline} and education.

With this, [[climate]{.mark} action]{.underline}---a highly cooperative
field---**[[has been put on the back burner]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
will likely remain there for some time.

\"The Working Groups are asking themselves why they are doing this and
why they should continue, but it is crucial that they continue their
work, albeit to a lesser degree than before,\" says Rottem and
continues:

\"There might not be any direct political results right now, but it is
important to persist even in the face of geopolitical challenges.\"

\"If the working groups were to disintegrate, it would take a very long
time to rebuild those knowledge networks. We are seeing the start of
this in Trump\'s USA right now.\"

John Holdren: Well, I think it is a factor, but disentangling what
Trump's motivations might be is a fool's errand, if I may say so. It's
undoubtedly partly that, but who knows whether that's simply his
argument to attract corporate support or whether it's really important
to him? I think one of the things that's important to
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, he wants to become the first president in
a very long time to expand US territory. He [[thinks he'll get on Mount
Rushmore if he can take Greenland]{.mark} and make Canada a 51st
state.]{.underline}

But the other thing [[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} seems to want is simply
to have the power to do whatever he wants. And [he's been knocking down
guardrails.]{.underline} He's been knocking down obstacles to his
uninhibited exercise of power in practically every domain he can think
of. And so it's hard to interpret what he's doing to science in the
United States, and worldwide as well, without concluding that [[he's
simply against science]{.mark}, against universities, [because he's
against facts. He's **against use of analysis in
decision-making**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} He's against independent
opinion. That's why he's going after not just the media, he's going
after libraries and museums. He's not just going after the diversity,
equity and inclusion agenda, [[he's going after the climate change
agenda]{.underline},]{.mark} the toxic substances agenda, [every aspect
of environment---]{.underline}he's going after windmills, for heaven's
sakes. And again, it's hard to see that as anything but a violent
reaction against everybody who's had the temerity to disagree with him
about anything.

The choice may now be moot. [[Under Trump,]{.mark} even climate
scientists who would prefer to somehow stay below the political fray
cannot. The administration has made their work by definition political.
[Climate science is seen as "climate fanaticism]{.mark}]{.underline},"
and the temple of worship must be rooted out. Project 2025, the
political initiative promoted by the Heritage Foundation and dozens of
conservative partners across the US and which is serving as a playbook
for the Trump administration, spells out its goals for all to see:

Of course, science has never been neutral, and objectivity is something
of a mirage. Perhaps what is more valuable and reliable is
intersubjectivity, or when personal biases are removed through the
collective process of scientist after scientist coming to the same
observation or finding. When it comes to climate change, a study
published in 2021 found that 98.7% of climate scientists and 100% of
expert-level climate scientists agree that human activities are making
the Earth warmer. At least the "fanatics" can agree.

[Trump seeks to exorcise]{.underline} anyone and [everyone working on
climate change. Though his push has only been in the works for one
month[, it will leave scars for **decades**]{.mark}]{.underline} to
come. [Many [universities]{.mark} that are heavily [dependent on federal
funding]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including some departments at my
own institution, [[have frozen faculty hiring and are rescinding]{.mark}
or stopping [graduate student admissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This
will deal **generational blows**]{.mark}. Institutions can be torn down
overnight, but they cannot be rebuilt in a day.]{.underline}
[[His]{.underline}]{.mark} vitriolic [[efforts will also hasten]{.mark}
the trajectory to [a world]{.mark} that is at least 2°C warmer -- one
[in which the Arctic]{.mark} as we know it **[is totally and utterly
gone.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

US Arctic science and the communities they risk abandoning

[The [cuts to scientific funding are enormous]{.mark}. Government
agencies are collapsing and [institutional knowledge is **disappearing
overnight**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [NOAA may soon be incapable of issuing
warnings about hurricanes, let alone the state of the Arctic ice
cap]{.underline}. In times like these, it is crucial to build and
maintain community with whatever means possible, whether that means
getting together in small groups to maintain a sense of solidarity or
working virtually with international colleagues who might have access to
precious research funding.

US science must take a stand, for its survival depends on it. I hesitate
to say that the world's survival depends on it, for the world will
continue in some form, just as it would if a nuclear war went off. But a
world without US contributions to climate science and polar science,
where it has been a leader for decades, will not be a pretty one.

A paper led by former NASA climate scientist James Hansen published
earlier this February found that [in the past two years alone, global
temperature skyrocketed 0.4°C]{.underline}. The authors observe that
"[polar climate change has the greatest long-term effect on humanity"
due to the potential for polar ice melt to inject huge amounts of
freshwater into the North Atlantic Ocean]{.underline}. This could shut
down the Gulf Stream within the next 20 to 30 years with disastrous
effects on the global environment, from rising sea levels along the US
East Coast to colder winters in Europe and flipped seasons in the
Amazon. Given Trump's policies, this tipping point may come sooner than
ever, though still long after he could face recrimination.

The evisceration of climate change research

During the Cold War, nationally-scaled military, security, and economic
interests motivated a great deal of research in all of the eight Arctic
states, including the US and Russia but also Canada and the Nordic
countries, as an article led by historian Ronald Doel explains. This
trend seems to be rearing its head again.

The difference between science during the Cold War and today is that
[[the US and Russia are willfully ignoring and even attacking work on
climate change]{.mark} despite it being one of the most pressing issues
facing the region]{.underline}. Even the US security establishment
recognizes this fact. In 2014, the Pentagon released a report noting
that climate change posed "immediate risks" to national security." In
2017, Trump's former defense secretary James Mattis acknowledged in
Senate testimony that climate change was real and that it posed a threat
to US overseas interests and Department of Defense assets around the
world. Under Trump 2.0, that threat has somehow simply disappeared -- as
have the people working on the bête noire of the new administration.

In the month since Trump has taken office, over [[10 percent of the US
National Science Foundation has been fired, including "all of its
experts]{.underline}]{.mark}, a class of contract workers who are
specialists [in niche scientific fields,]{.underline}" according to
Politico. Making matters worse, the experts did not have to be let go.
Instead, NSF leaders decided to fire them in the interest of "fairness"
given that probationary workers were required to be made redundant. In a
sudden return of McCarthyism, [[NSF staff meetings are no longer
recorded out of fear of who might get a hold of the
tapes]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[[Entire programs are now gone]{.mark}, too]{.underline}. [The entire
staff at [the Human Environment and Geographic Sciences Program,
which]{.mark} has [funded research into]{.mark} issues such as [climate
change and human-environment relations, has been shown the
door]{.mark}]{.underline}. Millions of dollars in funding that was set
to be awarded by the NSF in the coming weeks to researchers who had
spent countless hours refining their proposals are now likely to never
see the light of day.

#### Trump specifically makes it impossible to cooperate on pandemics

//DH

[Along with the executive order freezing foreign aid]{.underline},
President Donald [[Trump's decision to withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark} the
United States [[from the World Health Organization]{.underline}]{.mark}
(WHO) [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[alarming. No country can
manage a global pandemic on its own]{.underline}]{.mark} or ignore the
risks of one breaking out elsewhere in the world. [Viruses do not
respect national borders]{.underline} or political ideologies. They
spread quickly across the world. [The world needs to work together to
contain them. The WHO plays a vital role]{.underline} in that.

Leaders are failing to act with sufficient urgency and ambition in the
face of current and future threats, partly because they are not learning
the lessons from past crises. As the Spanish-American philosopher George
Santayana wrote over a hundred years ago: "Those who cannot remember the
past are condemned to repeat it."

These words rang in my mind as I helped unveil the Doomsday Clock in
Washington DC this week. The Clock's hands were moved forward to 89
seconds to midnight -- signifying that we are at the closest point to
destroying our world since the Clock's creation in 1947.

The decision to move the Clock's hands forward reflects both the
severity of the existential threats facing humanity, and the weakness of
political leadership on the global stage.

Pandemics are a case in point. Too few leaders have learned the critical
lesson that international cooperation is essential to pandemic
prevention, preparedness, and response. A cycle of panic and neglect has
historically characterized the politics of pandemics. We are back in the
neglect phase.

When the Elders (a group of former world leaders I am honored to chair)
commissioned a global public opinion survey in 2024, we found people all
over the world see the pandemic threat as a lower risk than other
existential threats, with only 34 percent of respondents thinking it
will grow in future. The vast majority of pandemic scientists think
otherwise. The survey also showed most people believe that, after the
experience of COVID, leaders will know what to do next time.
Unfortunately, this may be little more than wishful thinking.

Nations working effectively together is essential to managing the risks
of invisible pathogens that spread around the world freely, but that is
not what appears to be happening.

[[The world is at risk of reducing its support for the WHO, at a time
when its essential role in coordinating global efforts on disease
surveillance,]{.mark} resilience, and emergency response, [is needed
more than ever]{.mark}]{.underline}; countries must defend the
organization's indispensable mandate to promote and safeguard global
health. And other critical global health institutions are also at risk,
including the Pandemic Fund and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief, or PEPFAR.

This all as naturally occurring disease outbreaks are becoming more
prevalent, exacerbated by the climate and environmental crisis.
[Pandemic neglect is inexcusable given the lessons from
COVID]{.underline} and the current spate of infectious disease
outbreaks, including mpox and Marburg. Of grave concern is the
possibility that the devasting H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in birds,
cattle, and other species could turn into a full-blown human pandemic.

## Science Diplomacy advantage

### 1nc -- Arctic Council fails

#### Consensus and funding rules block Arctic Council effectiveness

Rachael Lorna **Johnstone,** 20**25** - professor of law at the
University of Akureyri, Iceland, and at the University of Greenland. She
is a specialist in polar law and international human rights law. "The
Arctic Council: Challenges to the "Science" in Science Diplomacy" 4/23,

//DH

[The Arctic Council is currently facing the biggest challenge to its
existence]{.underline} in its nearly 30-year history -- and things can
still get worse. I want to outline some procedural, practical and
political roadblocks to its success as a forum for science diplomacy and
suggest some alternatives.

The first procedural challenge: [[The Arctic Council works on a
consensus-basis]{.underline}]{.mark}. [All eight Arctic State members
must accept every project]{.underline}. To put it another way, **[[it is
a veto system]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [any Member State can block any
activity]{.underline} or refuse to adopt any report.

The Arctic Council emerged from the Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy (AEPS) and has, from the very beginning, been focused primarily
on environmental science and increasingly on Indigenous wellbeing.
Nearly everything they do is coloured by the reality of anthropogenic
climate change.

However, today, [[one Member State **rejects the established climate
science**]{.underline}]{.mark}; and, moreover, rejects the scientific
method as evidenced in rapid changes to healthcare research and public
policy. Artificial Intelligence ([AI) flagging of trigger words,
including "climate change]{.underline}," "indigenous community,"
"equity," and "gender", [puts at risk many of its central
projects]{.underline}, not just the many ostensibly focused on climate
research, but also sustainable development activities like the keystone,
Icelandic-led, Gender Equality in the Arctic project.

A related practical challenge that is not new but is worsening, is
funding capacity. [[All States have limited funding, but the situation
is particularly acute in Russia and is]{.mark} rapidly [worsening in the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates: the former
because of an expensive war and occupation of Ukraine; the latter owing
to political choices to cut science funding and exclude unfavoured
topics.

This is worsened by a political challenge: a securitisation of
science-funding. Increasing instability in the High North pushes all
Arctic States to pivot funding towards hard security topics. Money is
redirected to military security and corporate security, away from human
and environmental security.

This takes us back to another procedural limitation: [the Arctic Council
cannot replace this funding with external financing,]{.underline} e.g.,
from the EU, China or India. **[[All projects must receive at least half
of their funding from the eight Arctic States]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[This is a policy measure to prevent powerful observers with deep
pockets from dominating decisions]{.underline} about research
priorities. But this means that [[unless the eight Arctic States can
finance a project to at least 50%, it cannot go ahead]{.mark} within the
Arctic Council]{.underline}.

[A more fundamental political challenge]{.underline} [facing the Arctic
Council is]{.underline} that for the first time in its history, [one
Member State is openly calling to annex the territory of another Member
State and refusing to rule out the rule of force]{.underline} to achieve
its ends. The Kingdom of Denmark will take the chair of the Arctic
Council in May 2025. Experienced Greenlandic diplomat Kenneth Høegh will
act as Arctic Ambassador and Chair of the Senior Arctic Officials;
longstanding politician and current Greenlandic Minister for Foreign
Affairs Vivien Motzfeldt will chair the Ministerial meeting. Alongside
Greenlander Sara Olsvig, Chair of Inuit Circumpolar Council, they make a
formidable team. However, it comes at a time when [[the Arctic Council
is under **existential threat**]{.mark}. Holding high-level
meetings]{.underline} between the Senior Arctic Officials and Indigenous
Permanent Participants' leadership, not to mention the Ministerial
meeting, in Greenland or Denmark, [will become increasingly
difficult]{.underline}. In fact, the May ministerial meeting will be
held entirely virtually and not live-streamed. It remains to be seen if
the customary declaration will be agreed at this meeting. The 2019
Rovaniemi precedent of stalemate, at which US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo vetoed any declaration that acknowledged climate change, and the
other States and Permanent Participants refused to sign a declaration
that ignored this reality, does not give cause for hope, at least for a
declaration with any meaningful content.

Arctic Today, 3/3,

<https://www.arctictoday.com/can-the-arctic-council-survive-the-trump-administration-probably-not-heres-why/>
//DH

The havoc caused by the new American administration has been devastating
on a wide range of fronts. [[We are]{.underline}]{.mark} quite possibly
[[witnessing the **end** of the western rules-based international
order]{.mark}]{.underline} that has lasted since the end of World War
II.

[[While Trump's attention hasn't yet shifted to the Arctic
Council]{.mark},]{.underline} it should be apparent to all that [**[this
is just a matter of time]{.underline}**. [When he does, the outcomes
will be devastating. He]{.underline}]{.mark} [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably take three steps that will combine to either [[gut the key
works of the Council, or]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly [[end it
altogether]{.underline}.]{.mark}

First, [Trump's elimination of international aid
demonstrates]{.underline} his policy of selfish isolationism. His
decision to stop much of the assistance provided under the USAID program
shows that [he has no inclination to understand the benefits of a
cooperative multilateral system]{.underline}, or a desire to continue a
policy that every U.S. president since Kennedy has supported.

In addition, he has openly criticized NATO and the ICC, along with many
of the U.S. economic agreements with other nations. [In both his first
term and now his second, Trump has shown a clear lack of support for
international organizations and multilateral agreements.]{.underline}
Specifically, he seems intent on either ending American participation or
upending the agreements solely for American benefit.

[Trump has already demonstrated that even if he doesn't withdraw from
the Arctic Council, he would actively gut some of the most
important]{.underline} achievements in line with his own goals. First,
[[he doesn't "believe" in climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline} During
Trump's first term, the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi
in 2019 failed to produce a final declaration for the first time since
the organization was created. This was because the U.S. delegation --
under the leadership of Secretary of States Mike Pompeo -- objected to
the term "climate change" or any reference to the Paris Accord. There is
nothing to suggest that the American position on climate change will be
altered. If anything, it will probably get more strident.

Reshaping Society

Trump has also moved quickly to end American programs that are in any
way associated with the issues surrounding Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI). [[It is highly unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark} that as
part of this process to reshape American society, [[his administration
would support any]{.underline}]{.mark} of the important [[initiatives
supporting the northern Indigenous Peoples under the Arctic
Counci]{.underline}l. [His administration has had no qualms about ending
the support that the U.S. had provided to the developing
world]{.underline}]{.mark}[, so he will almost certainly be unwilling to
continue to provide any support of the Permanent Participants or any of
the Arctic Council programs that support them]{.underline}.

Third, [[Trump]{.mark} has [directly attacked two of the core state
members of the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since his second
term began, he has repeatedly threatened to "take over" both Greenland
and Canada. While some at first thought he was just joking, Trump has
continued to say that these are his intentions. He has begun to take
active steps, through the threats of a trade war to critically weaken
Canada in order to make it more amendable to "joining" the U.S. Again,
[even if he doesn't move to directly destroy the Arctic Council, how
could Canada and Denmark work with the U.S.,]{.underline} [knowing that
the Americans are actively moving to weaken or even cripple them as a
state?]{.underline}

Fourth, the one Arctic state that Trump has attempted to improve
relations with -- Russia -- remains also problematic for the Arctic
Council. Trump's effort to work with Russia will make the existing
issues that the Arctic Council had with Russia even more difficult.
Trump has already called for the Russians to be readmitted to the G-7.
If he doesn't move to end the Arctic Council, he will undoubtedly call
for any sanctions against Russia to be eliminated and for the country to
be fully integrated.

At the same time he is actively moving to directly be involved in
assisting Russia to complete its conquest of Ukraine. In a move that is
reminiscent of the conquest of Czechoslovakia through the capitulation
of the U.K. and France to Germany in 1938, Trump has begun direct
negotiations with Russia without the involvement of the Ukrainians.
[Putin now knows that it has the support of Trump.]{.underline}

As a result, [there is every reason to believe that Russia will continue
with its acts of aggression against its neighbours.]{.underline} [This
includes both Sweden and Finland]{.underline}, who both chose to join
NATO. Putin has always made it clear that it was the possibility of
Ukraine joining NATO that was one of the reasons for his decision to
launch his war of aggression against Ukraine in 2014.

Scorched Earth Policy

Ultimately, [this means that the Arctic Council now faces two terrible
scenarios]{.underline}. The first is that [in his scorched earth policy
toward multilateralism, Trump will either move to end the Arctic Council
or at least remove the U.S. as a member]{.underline}. He may also carry
out his threat to ensure that both Canada and Denmark also cease to be
meaningful members of the Arctic Council. If he truly does intend to
take over Canada, it won't even be a state. Even if he only means to
weaken and reduce Canada to a vassal state, its ability to participate
will be damaged -- if not eliminated.

Likewise, if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated. Assuming that
somehow the Arctic Council survives an American withdrawal, and the U.S.
follows up its threats to control Greenland and Canada, the Council
would have only the active membership of Finland, Sweden, Norway and
Iceland.

[[Even if the U.S. remains in the Arctic Council, its current actions
means the **gutting of some of its most important
missions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [The U.S. won't support actions to
eliminate the causes of climate change, and it is very unlikely to
support the Permanent Participants.]{.underline} Outside of the Council,
perhaps the Coast Guard forum will continue. But even here Trump is
having an impact. He has already fired Admiral Linda Pagan, the
Commandant of the USCG. American officials have suggested it was because
of her commitment to DEI policies.

Even more dangerously, [this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Council. It would also include a Denmark that has either
lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take action to prevent this.
It will include a Canada that is being continually weakened by American
action,]{.underline} and is either actively trying to stop an American
takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S. [It will also include
a Russia that is being increasingly supported]{.underline} by the U.S.
and has been given the right of conquest over Ukraine. Furthermore, if
Ukraine was conquered for considering joining NATO, the future of both
Finland and Sweden (which did actually join NATO) will undoubtedly be
even more problematic for Russia.

[These are dire times for the Arctic Council. It is hard to think of a
way to maintain its many successes in supporting an understanding of the
impact of climate change on the Arctic.]{.underline} It has also played
an important role in supporting a greater awareness of the northern
Indigenous Peoples in the region. And perhaps most importantly, [it has
served as the principal means of promoting a peaceful and harmonious
international regime of cooperation.]{.underline}

All of [this is now at risk. Perhaps Trump won't think that the Arctic
Council is worth his attention, and it can somehow remain under the
American radar until the next presidential election]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} as many have said in the past, [hope is not a
strategy.]{.underline}

During the two years Norway has led the Arctic Council work, [[a new
enemy of international cooperation has appeared]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Donald [[Trump.]{.underline}]{.mark}

He has also used the past few days to light a fuse under that
cooperation.

The other day, [he [reiterated]{.mark} the message of]{.underline}
considering [using [military power to take
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline} from Denmark. When Denmark takes the
chairship, it also takes the chairship over a nation that directly
threatens its national borders.

Threatens own members

However, Trump is not content with threatening just one of the member
countries. Canada was also told a few days ago that the country should
cease to be an independent nation and be incorporated as a US state

The ambitions, if I can use such a mild expression about Trump\'s absurd
megalomania, are strongly condemned by both Canada and Denmark.

However, [[Trump\'s obstacles to Arctic cooperation extend
further]{.underline}]{.mark} than that. [[Under the Danish chairship,
two policy areas in particular are highlighted: climate and indigenous
peoples.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is emphasized precisely by
Greenland\'s special position in the Danish leadership.

One would have serious problems rubbing sleep out of one\'s eyes to not
have discovered that [[these are two topics that Trump is **intensely
opposed to**]{.underline},]{.mark} in addition to a general opposition
to international organizations.

Therefore, [[the chance that the Arctic Council will collapse in the
next two years is imminent]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Cooperation in the Arctic is under pressure from more than just
Russia.]{.underline}

[[With Trump's revived ambitions to buy Greenland or absorb
Canada]{.underline}]{.mark} into the United States, [[the]{.mark} very
[idea of the Arctic as a region governed by peaceful cooperation is
under threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cold winds are blowing from every
direction.

Storm Clouds from East and West

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shook the foundations of
the Arctic Council. The seven Western member states paused their
participation, while Russia withdrew from the Barents cooperation and
hinted at doing the same in the Arctic Council.

Under Norway's chairship, cooperation slowly resumed. When Norway
assumed the role in May 2023, the message was clear: the primary goal
was the Council's survival. For Denmark, the goal must be to make it
function again.

But the shadows of the Trump era still loom large.

For political, moral, and practical reasons, a full return to business
as usual with Russia remains out of reach. The situation is still
fragile.

Greenland and Trump

The new [Trump]{.underline} administration [casts a long shadow over the
Arctic Council]{.underline}. During his previous term, the US refused to
endorse the Council's declaration because it mentioned climate change.

[Trump has shown little respect for Indigenous peoples and has
repeatedly suggested buying Greenland]{.underline}.

[[As Denmark takes over the chair]{.mark}, with Greenland in the
driver's seat, [the geopolitical backdrop is more volatile than ever.
The US President has openly expressed a willingness to interfere
in]{.mark}]{.underline} what are considered [[internal affairs
within]{.underline}]{.mark} the Kingdom of
[[Denmark.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[This is hardly a recipe for smooth cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It does not help that Trump has also proposed making Canada, another
Arctic Council member, the 51st US state.

[[The case of the U.S. shows the fragility of climate governance

withdrawal from]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[weakened not only Arctic climate governance but also the confidence in
multilateral governance]{.mark} frameworks.]{.underline} On 20 January
2021, Biden\'s administration rejoined the Paris Agreement.95 However,
it will take time to re-build dismantled climate structures in the
Arctic.

Palosaari and Tynkkynen point out that [[climate change' international
discourses are not reflected in national policies]{.underline} [where a
tension exists between reducing]{.underline}]{.mark} [greenhouse gas
[emissions and the possibility to engage in future oil and gas
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}.96 Concerning oil and gas reserves,
"Arctic continental shelves constitute one of the world\'s largest
remaining prospective areas.\"97 In fact, [several Arctic coastal
states]{.underline}, e.g., Canada, Denmark, and Russia, [have either
claimed or have submitted a continental shelf claim]{.underline} to the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.98 For instance, the
[Trump]{.underline}\'s administration [granted offshore oil leases in
the Chukchi Sea]{.underline}.99 In 2018, the IMO\'s Vessel Traffic
Management System for the Bering Strait100 was the product of a Russian

//DH

Certain changes have already occurred even in the treaty-based Arctic
regimes.

The atmosphere of cooperation has been damaged at the International
Maritime Organization, which devised the Polar Code (Koivurova and
Shibata, 2023). Political bias, such as boycotting or avoiding
engagement with Russian representatives, has forced Russia to withdraw
from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which
recommends quotas for fishing in the North Atlantic (The Fishing Daily,
2024). The Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears continues to
operate, and its members even hold video consultations, but some of its
work has been curtailed; for example, data on human-bear conflict is no
longer exchanged. [While the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic
Scientific Cooperation formally survives, cooperation between Russian
and other Arctic states' scientists has largely ended]{.underline} (Rees
and Büntgen, 2024).

[These trends are likely to continue under]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} Administration, especially given its
climate/environmental policy. During his first term, [[in 2019,]{.mark}
[Trump refused to sign the Arctic Council's declaration, since it
mentioned the Paris Agreement,]{.mark} and]{.underline} Mike [Pompeo

In recent months, [[the Danish Presidency of the Arctic Council has been
challenged by the new US position on the Arctic]{.mark}, Greenland and
Europe]{.underline}. President Donald [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}
continued provocative [[statements regarding]{.underline}]{.mark} the
potential transfer of [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} to US control
have [[heightened political tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}. However,
neither the Kingdom of Denmark as a whole nor Greenland itself has
supported these assertions. In April 2025, Danish Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen made an official visit to Nuuk, where she, together with
Greenland's acting head of government Múte Bourup Egede and newly
elected head of government Jens-Frederik Nielsen issued a statement
rejecting any external claims. This joint statement demonstrates unity
within the Danish Realm in the face of external pressure.

The United States views Greenland as a strategically important territory
for its missile defense and Arctic surveillance system, especially in
the context of the development of the Pituffik base. This is related to
the US strategic pressure on the Kingdom. [Denmark's response has been
to strengthen its position in the Arctic while avoiding direct
confrontation with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
supporting Greenland's right to self-determination, and strengthening
its defense to protect its interests in the region. However, [[growing
pressure from the US is undermining the Kingdom's diplomatic control
over the Arctic agenda and is contributing to the **decline of the
Arctic Council's influence as a platform for regional
cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### The Arctic Council can't enforce policies

Zhaklin V. **Yaneva**, 20**25** -- PhD from the Complutense University
of Madrid and this paper is loosely based on her doctoral thesis,
related to the cooperation in the Arctic Region and mainly within the
Arctic Council framework. She is currently employed in the Ministry of

**AC = Arctic Council**

In general terms, Arctic cooperation is characterized by an intrinsic
interaction between hard law instruments, relating to the (in)direct
application of binding international treaties in the Arctic space, and
soft law mechanisms, based on the establishment--- mainly through the
scientific and political role of the AC---of new procedures that apply
specifically to the region, but are not legally binding. The Council has
become an important institution for formulating the Arctic agenda,
issuing detailed guidelines that could be useful for national and
international legislative proposals on the region. Thus, through its
activity, [the Council "shapes the rules that will guide the behaviour
of different actors]{.underline}, even in the absence of hard power or
the threat of legal repercussions" in case of non-compliance11. In that
vein, we can affirm that the creation and existence of the Council
illustrates the importance of soft power: [Although the AC does not have
regulatory powers to compel its members to implement a particular
obligation, cooperation has been increasing under the
auspices]{.underline} and supervision of the circumpolar institution. In
this line of thought, a frequently discussed problem is that [[the
AC]{.mark} remains a decision-shaping rather than a decision-making
institution as it **[lacks a mandate to]{.mark}** formulate, implement,
monitor **or [enforce any policies]{.mark}** or regulations [upon its
Member States]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 1nc -- Arctic Council irrelevant

#### The Arctic Council has minimal impact on Arctic governance -- other agreements matter more

//DH

Cooperation with Russia has remained on single low-level issues for
those countries that share a border or boundary with the country,
namely, Finland, Norway and the USA in particular. In addition, the
Arctic Council has survived and will likely continue to do so. However,
[[Arctic governance does not]{.mark} stand or [fall within the Arctic
Council.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Governance is a term used to describe how to deal with problems, in this
instance in an Arctic context. [[Most governance structures are found at
the national level,]{.mark} which]{.underline} at the end of the day
[sets the rules]{.underline} and regulations [for what can be done in
the various Arctic territories]{.underline}. Some governance problems,
such as the need for a moratorium on fisheries in the Central Arctic
Ocean, are indeed raised to the international level, either because a
joint solution is needed to effectively manage or deal with a problem or
because the countries have a shared interest in collaborating and can
thus reap additional benefits through scale and spillover effects.

In this regard, [[the Arctic Council plays]{.underline}]{.mark} an
important but essentially **[[a minor role]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First
and foremost, it provides scientific advice and reports through its
different working groups, led by experts from the Arctic countries and
the six indigenous representations (and some non-Arctic representatives
too). Second, the Arctic Council and its ministerial meetings every
second year act as a lightning rod for attention to Arctic international
relations. The Arctic states have themselves promoted this forum as the
primary arena for Arctic issues because it helped convey the message of
a peaceful, stable and cooperative Arctic region.

However[, if one examines governance in the Arctic, [institutions like
the]{.mark} UN [Law of the Sea, the Polar Code, the EU, or]{.mark} even
[bilateral agreements]{.mark} between Arctic states [on coast guard
cooperation, fisheries management, and]{.mark}]{.underline} cultural and
educational [[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline} and cooperation [[tend to be
much more **impactful**]{.underline} [and
**far-reaching**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in terms of dealing with
Arctic-specific problems.]{.underline} That does not mean the Arctic
Council is irrelevant, just that it is one---albeit much talked
about---piece in a larger Arctic governance puzzle.

### 1nc -- science diplomacy fails

#### Science diplomacy is exaggerated -- science is easily politicized and subject to conflict

Tim **Flink**, 20**20** -- German Centre of Higher Education and Science
Studies (DZHW) and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Berlin Germany "The
Sensationalist Discourse of Science Diplomacy: A Critical Reflection"
The Hague Journal of Diplomacy, 8/5,
<https://brill.com/view/journals/hjd/15/3/article-p359_7.xml?language=en>
//DH

The narrative of science diplomacy bears on the scenario of a world
deteriorating by numerous grand challenges of planetary dimension which
national governments are unwilling or unable to tackle. In this
Dickensian portrait, science diplomacy promises to (re)install
collaboration of actors and reason in international affairs. Amidst
defective national egoistic policy-making,
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and their advocates are [[portrayed
as]{.underline}]{.mark} competent and altruistic [[saviours that]{.mark}
help the world]{.underline}'s society solve its grand challenges and
[[overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[looming
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}19 The allegedly collaborative attitude of
scientific researchers alludes --- vaguely and affirmatively as is the
entire discourse --- to scientific universalism, a central element of
Robert K. Merton's Normative Structure of Science:20 that scientific
claims must be assessed by the scientists irrespective of the
particulars of those who are claiming, for example, race, gender,
academic status, national provenance. It is important to note that
scientific universalism is supposed to guide the internal social
relations of the science system, and --- as trivial as it may sound ---
that we are dealing with an ought-to norm. However, the discourse on
science diplomacy feigns scientific universalism into a version of
cosmopolitanism, and pretends that both would de facto constitute the
inner life of scientists; that is, those alleged august men that would
but only work in a collaborative manner, sharing knowledge and accepting
to value truth claims regardless wherefrom. Moreover and according to
this discourse, scientists would be brilliant in transferring their
knowledge to avert egoistic, uninformed and irrevocably detrimental
decisions made by politicians.21 Whether it is a rhetoric strategy, a
firm conviction or both, these claims allow for devaluating national
politics for having egoistic interests, which would need to be
surmounted if cross-border challenges were to be tackled.
Correspondingly, the imagined figure of a traditional diplomat is often
implicitly used to substantiate that foreign policy making was incapable
of grasping complex issues and overcoming national interests. Kristin
Lord and Vaughan Turekian, promoters of science diplomacy, even argued
that scientists were better diplomats and should 'maybe even take the
lead' in diplomacy.22 [[Apart from these **sensationalist promises**, it
is the alleged unpolitical nature of science that gets instrumentalised
for political purposes]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The only problem is that [[such an idealised image of science hardly
matches]{.mark} with]{.underline} lifeworld
[[realities,]{.underline}]{.mark} and it does not even need 50 years of
the Social Studies of Science to continuously prove that
[[science]{.underline}]{.mark} --- just as any other social system ---
[[may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[contain chauvinism]{.underline},
[fierce competition, vanity]{.underline}]{.mark} and reputation
[[games]{.mark}, misconduct]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
unsavoury [[entanglements with nefarious business and political
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} To provide only a few examples with
regard to its international dimensions, editors of the scientific
journal Nature23 recently criticised that researchers and especially
reviewers would have increasingly devalued the works of 'others' on the
basis of national-cultural stereotypes.24 The US Department of Health's
Office for Research Integrity (ORI) even openly accuses and warns
against practices of plagiarism that would be common among young
scientists from 'non-Western cultures' (i.e., Central and Eastern
European, Latin American, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian).25 But
also international scientific engagement under the heading of science
diplomacy was held ethically problematic, as it also led to parachute
science.26

That large parts of the discourse on science diplomacy sensationally
portrays scientists as unpolitical, cosmopolitan and truth-seeking
collaborators, however, seems not naive but strategic. And yet, the
question is whether such [[raised expectations]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
provided by promoters of this discourse[, [are]{.underline}]{.mark} not
[[greatly overdrawn]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and what happens, if they
get disappointed?

Based on available data in an open-source environment, [t[here was no

Russian forces in the Arctic between 2022 and 2024. This contrasts the
2015--2021 period]{.underline}]{.mark} [where the two rivals provoked
each other]{.underline} outside the coast of Norway. Why have U.S. and
Russian forces stopped antagonizing each other? Using Brinkmanship as a
theoretical model of explanation, [[this study finds the Ukraine War to
be an **Arctic tranquilizer**.]{.mark} [This is partly due to fear
of]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[escalation but also]{.mark} due to
strategic necessity: [neither U.S. nor Russian forces can afford]{.mark}

The finding, however, must not be interpreted as a claim of Arctic
peacefulness. [[Malign subwater activities with attack submarines,
underwater drones, and special forces preparing for sabotage]{.mark}
against critical infrastructure]{.underline} on the seabed,
[[accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark}.84 [This is also the case with
numerous civilian research and fishing vessels pursuing covert
operations below the threshold of war]{.underline}. Examples are
possible sabotage against fiberoptic cables, mapping of gas pipelines,
hazardous maneuvers with jetfighters against personnel on oil rigs,
reconnaissance on critical objects, electronic jamming of GPS signals,
unexpected flows of refugees across borders, or outright provocations to
map adversaries' response time and readiness. These so-called '[[hybrid
threats' are]{.underline}]{.mark} nevertheless [**[less
dangerous]{.mark}** than nuclear rivals aiming to "manipulate the shared
risk of war"]{.underline}. [[Malign operations below the threshold of
war are **primarily a law enforcement issue**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These challenges belong to the police rather than the military and
should primarily be seen as a perennial phenomenon evolving between
rivals.85 To Russia in particular, this modus operandi -- in crisis
short of war -- has become the most likely course of action due to
Russia's military inferiority vis-à-vis NATO and the United States.
Russia's secret services, like the FSB, GRU and SVR, is therefore a more
useful political instrument than the Northern Fleet or the Leningrad
Military District.

Hence, as U.S. and Russian forces tacitly agree to maintain a subtle
sense of crisis stability in the Norwegian Sea, defined as an absence of
mutual provocations, the rivals nevertheless need to display presence
and agility. But [contrary to the malign 2015--2021 period, post-2022
deployments are more tempered.]{.underline} [Cautiously confined to
mutually exclusive zones of operations, [Russian NOTAMs are absent in
the Norwegian Sea while U.S. maritime task groups are absent in the
Barents Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Abstaining from provocative exercises
also means that [the two adversaries pursue a **stricter rule of
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Careful not to invoke an Arctic
escalatory "tit-for-tat" logic,]{.mark} [this]{.mark}]{.underline}
"gentleman's [[agreement]{.mark}" can be interpreted as]{.underline} a
sort of [tacit cooperation. It [allows state leaders and military
commanders to **buy time** in case of **unintended
accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the post-Ukrainian
environment,]{.underline} technical or human errors close to Russia's
second-strike capabilities on the Kola Peninsula should be avoided. The
[[operative restraints]{.underline}]{.mark} thereby [[provide the two
opponents with more room for maneuver. If tension]{.mark}]{.underline}
inadvertently [[spirals]{.underline}]{.mark} out of control, [[U.S. and
Russian defense officials are allowed to calm down]{.mark},
[communicate, and clarify misperceptions]{.mark}]{.underline} or
misunderstandings. Paradoxically, therefore, Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a sense of Arctic predictability;
a sense of crisis stability where both rivals are tied to a common
interest of war avoidance.

//DH

**Andreas Østhagen = senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute
who studies Arctic geopolitics**

Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic

Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions in the Arctic are]{.underline}]{.mark}
often more **[[stable and transparent]{.underline}]{.mark}** than many
assume.

[[Conflict is not easily triggered, considering the **vast
areas**]{.underline}]{.mark} and diverse countries involved. Østhagen
emphasises the enormity of the Arctic, which encompasses eight
countries, four million people, and extensive ocean areas. The countries
include Russia, the Nordic states, the USA, and Canada.

He notes that the significant Russian presence -- with almost half of
the Arctic landmass under Russian control -- influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North.

Iver B. Neumann, a Russia researcher and director at the FNI, concurs
that [the Arctic is less likely to witness armed conflict than other
global locations.]{.underline}

He believes the primary driver for military conflict in the Arctic is
Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base for nuclear weapons.

"There are three main ways to keep such weapons mobile: in aircraft, on
land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where such submarines exist, as
in Murmansk, there is also significant military attention. And where
there is military attention, there is also the potential for conflict,"
he says.

Neumann advises caution in responding to Russia\'s desire for global
attention and military control, stressing the importance of Norway
maintaining a cool head, enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to
intimidation.

Myth 2: Unresolved borders and a race for resources

[As the Arctic becomes more accessible]{.underline} due to melting sea
ice because of climate change[, **[a common myth]{.underline}**
[suggests a scramble for resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and land in the
North will occur.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} Østhagen clarifies that, unlike in other
parts of the world, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [**[no
disputes]{.underline}** [over Arctic borders]{.underline}.]{.mark}

"**[All the borders are settled]{.underline}**," he says, noting that
the last conflict between Canada and Greenland was resolved in 2022.

[Maritime boundaries are key for resource management and potential
conflict]{.underline}. Law of the sea grants coastal states sovereign
rights for resource exploitation in their economic zones.

In the Arctic, only one maritime boundary remains unresolve. It is
between the USA and Canada -- two close allies.

[[Østhagen]{.underline},]{.mark} who wrote his PhD on maritime disputes,
[[foresees no]{.mark} major [concerns regarding sovereignty or
territorial issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} He believes the myth persists
due to historical reasons but emphasises that, with all the land borders
settled and just one disputed sea border, Arctic resources are already
distributed among the eight Arctic states.

#### Prefer our evidence -- theirs is based upon Arctic [mythmaking]{.underline} about resources, shipping routes and Russian bases -- the reality is that there are clearly defined borders, no resource [disputes]{.underline} and [economics]{.underline} makes shipping and resource races nonviable

//DH

Global dynamics, from climate change to the decline of American hegemony
and technological revolution, are reshaping the Arctic. Unfortunately,
[[**mythmaking** about the Arctic continues to
distort]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}
available to both public and elite audiences. Heather Exner-Pirot
beautifully explains how easy this can be and, as Josh Tallis has
written, the phantom of Arctic misgovernance can be used to raise alarm
about an unusual gap in Arctic security governance. In reality, though,
the Arctic is profoundly normal.

The following is an effort to disassemble the leading myths about the
Arctic Ocean and to underscore nuggets of truth underlying the legends.
The natural tendency, noted above, for people to process their
understanding of the Arctic through the most dramatic filter possible,
is not easy to counteract by listing mundane realities. But [[**falling
for the hype** is not a good way to make policy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Refuting these myths can put the focus back on more mundane, but
ultimately more valuable, solutions.

The Legendary Arctic Scramble

Most of the modern Arctic myths and legends are spicing up mundane
realities with added drama. For example, [it's common to see the Arctic
referred to as a battleground for]{.underline} valuable natural
[resource]{.underline}s. It's the "\$1 Trillion Ocean", holding massive
reserves of oil and gas (or one trillion dollars' worth of critical
minerals, take your pick), with echoes of Dr. Evil. Competition over
resources is framed as a "race" or "battle," although it is often
unclear what winning might mean. Industry and science have long known
that the Arctic holds a significant endowment of natural resources.
Prospecting and [[development in the Arctic lag behind]{.mark} that of
other regions [due to the significant logistical challenges
and]{.mark}]{.underline} resulting [[extra costs]{.underline}]{.mark}
relating to arctic operations. Resource deposits in the Arctic must be
of a higher grade or size to attract investors and overcome the added
risk to capital. In short, [[it has]{.mark} historically [been cheaper
to look elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}. And that largely remains true:
[[There has not been a flood of]{.mark} investment and [new
development]{.mark}]{.underline} into the Arctic.

[Rather than unclaimed, ungoverned space, [the Arctic Ocean and
surrounding landmass are almost entirely sovereign lands and waters of
the eight Arctic states.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yes, there is a small area
of high seas, the central Arctic Ocean. This area is under a fishing
moratorium and can only be accessed through traversing an Arctic state's
waters (plus likely stopping in an Arctic state port). And yet the myth
of an Arctic wild west persists: "As a consequence of the rapidly
disappearing polar ice caps, there has been an increase in unclaimed
ocean and land territory, beyond any nation's control, that countries
are attempting to claim jurisdiction over," proclaims one analysis.
While this is a common argument, it is factually incorrect. It is
linking two separate issues into one misleading causal chain: the
decline in Arctic sea ice due to climate change, and the ongoing process
of defining boundaries and spaces under international law. In fact,
there is no unclaimed land territory in the Arctic. And there is just
one maritime boundary disagreement, between the United States and
Canada, over a tiny slice of the Beaufort Sea.

Perhaps the "Great Arctic Race" is about the overlapping claims to the
central Arctic Ocean seabed. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) permits coastal states to claim areas of the extended
continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone,
if they can prove that these areas are a natural prolongation of their
continental shelf. Russia, Denmark (via Greenland), and Canada have
overlapping claims in the central Arctic. Thus far, they have all
adhered to the process of defining these claims in accordance with
international law. Russia's law-abiding approach to the Arctic shelf
claims is a rare bright spot in the country's foreign policy.

The U.N. convention and seabed claims have been in the spotlight
recently as interest grows in seabed mining for critical minerals.
[Seabed mining is not likely to drive conflict over Arctic shelf
claims]{.underline}. The central Arctic Ocean --- over 200 nautical
miles from any coast --- is also an incredibly inhospitable area for
resource extraction. The Arctic Ocean still freezes in the winter, and
is sunk in the frigid darkness of the polar night. [The seabed mining
industry, like most global industry, is likely to look for less costly
options in warmer latitudes.]{.underline} While it cannot be assumed
that Russia will continue pursuing its shelf claims in accordance with
international law, it is likely to use lower-cost tools like lawfare or
information warfare to complicate central Arctic Ocean claims, rather
than apply high-cost and hard-to-sustain military options.

The Myth of Increasing Accessibility and Arctic Shipping

The idea that climate change is increasing accessibility in the Arctic
is repeated so often that it is taken for granted. There is an element
of truth here --- the thick cap of multiyear Arctic sea ice that has
shaped the region for thousands of years is melting away and will soon
be gone. But that is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, and the net
effect of climate change in the Arctic is making human activity harder,
not easier.

Shrinking sea ice leaves coastlines unprotected from stronger, more
frequent storms. Coastal erosion is higher in the Arctic than anywhere
else, threatening U.S. radar installations. Thawing permafrost causes
subsidence, destroying infrastructure and saddling Arctic states with
massive costs --- highest in Russia. Permafrost thaw will cause many
more disasters in coming years, in Russia and elsewhere. Massive
wildfires further endanger communities and infrastructure in the North.
At sea, increased storminess and stronger waves create hazards, along
with increases in drifting ice. At the heart of it all lies uncertainty
--- a powerful dissuading factor.

Arctic shipping lanes replacing Suez and Panama is another related myth.
When crisis erupts in the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, or the Panama Canal,
it is tempting to point north to emerging Arctic shipping lanes as
alternatives. On paper, Arctic shipping routes appear to offer
considerable savings of distance, time, and fuel between northern ports
in Asia, Europe, and North America. However, in practice, these shipping
routes remain largely notional. Over the last decade, destinational
Arctic maritime activity has ticked up, mostly driven by Russia's Yamal
liquified natural gas project and expansion at Canada's Mary River Mine.
Container ships and roll-on roll-offs are barely present, and this type
of traffic has showed no change in the past decade.

It is clear that [[Canada has no interest in opening the Northwest
Passage to]{.underline}]{.mark} international
[[shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, the complex routes of the
passage have draft limitations, significant remaining ice, and
inadequate charting. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President
Vladimir [[Putin has been]{.underline}]{.mark} personally [[driving
the]{.mark} effort to develop the [Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}]{.underline}, imposing an ambitious timeline for cargo
growth, **[[reality is not keeping pace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The
route is plagued by its own draft limitations and lack of]{.mark}
supporting [infrastructure, as well as unpredictable ice
hazards]{.mark}]{.underline}. International shipping vanished following
the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and while cargo totals have rebounded and
grown in the past two years, the Northern Sea Route is functionally a
route for Russian-flagged ships of all sorts to carry oil and gas to
Asian markets (and bring in construction materials for future
developments, which have been weakened by sanctions).

The Myth of Russian Dominance and American Indifference

[**[A large body of mythmaking]{.mark}** threatens to create a security
crisis in the Arctic by [sketch]{.mark}ing [a 10-foot-tall Russia intent
on conquering]{.mark} the region]{.underline} and controlling the ocean
and casting the United States as an impotent weakling. These outsize
legends are used to justify massive spending increases in the Arctic, as
well as significantly stronger measures against Russia, both of which
could contribute to escalation in the region and also ripple across the
global balance.

Russia's so-called "dominance" of the Arctic has been treated as gospel.
It is true that over half of the Arctic coastline is Russian territory,
and nearly half of the people living in the Arctic live in Russia. And
yet the discourse of Russian dominance in the Arctic goes beyond
geography. It also presents Russia's position as a threat to the United
States and to the entire Arctic Ocean. Of course, Moscow does everything
it can to nourish this sense of threat. Planting a flag at the seabed of
the North Pole --- possibly the most effective Russian public relations
stunt ever --- was a purely symbolic act, but continues to serve as a
reference point. Dropping paratroopers at the North Pole, or unfurling a
giant banner on the ice, are also gestures that feed the legend.

Arguments about Russia's so-called dominance of the Arctic reveal more
about America's own insecurities than the facts on the ground. This
framing creates a sense of unnecessary urgency and relies on a set of
measures that together would badly warp U.S. strategic planning. Part of
this is the legendary icebreaker gap, thoroughly debunked by Paul Avey.
Does Russia dominate the Arctic with its icebreakers? Or does it just
have a reasonable number of icebreakers for its 24,000 kilometer Arctic
coastline, along which Putin is desperately thirsting to build an
international shipping lane that has so far failed to catch on? Sober
analyses of Russia's power and strategy in the Arctic need to be
facts-based, rather than dealing in terms of dominance.

Yes, [[Russian military capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} and capacities
[in the Arctic are substantive.]{.underline} It is widely recognized
that Russian leadership began to rebuild and expand Arctic military
capabilities and capacities as soon as it was able to, starting in the
early 2000s. [Most authoritative analyses note that these installations
and systems [are **primarily defensive**]{.mark}]{.underline} in nature,
intended [[to help]{.mark} control and [protect Russia's economic and
strategic interests]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic, although they
could of course be useful in supporting aggression and, as Katarzyna
Zysk notes, Russian strategic thinking does not clearly differentiate
between offence and defense. [[All great powers have military bases
along their coastlines]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Russia has both
strategic and economic interests to protect in its Arctic territory.

And if fears over Russia are not enough, another myth holds that China
is coming for the Arctic. Or that Chinese-Russian cooperation will open
the door for Chinese dominance in the Arctic. As Marc Lanteigne has
explained, relations between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic are far
more complicated. And others have noted that the myth of China's growing
influence in the Arctic is mostly serving Beijing's interests. It is
important to watch the broader trajectory of Russian-Chinese relations
and not rush to assumptions about China's future in the Arctic.

In parts as a result of fears over Russian dominance, claims that the
U.S. Department of Defense "needs to do more in the Arctic" have also
become commonplace. The United States has identified several critical
gaps in operational capabilities and capacities in the Arctic, including
in the National Strategy for the Arctic Region as well as the Department
of Defense's Arctic strategy. The most significant gap is the North
Warning System, and the ongoing effort to replace this critical system.
Canada has also underscored its commitment to upgrade the key
continental defense architecture, most recently in an Arctic-focused
defense policy update. But it's also important to note that the United
States has significant Arctic military capabilities, including the
highest concentration of fifth-generation aircraft in the world, as well
as an airborne division in Alaska, along with a North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD) region. U.S. Navy submarines operate and train
regularly in the Arctic Ocean.

In the current budget context, in which the Department of Defense faces
flat and tight budgets, there are not free-floating resources to build
up any but the most vital capabilities in the Arctic. Broad calls for
significant spending increases in the Arctic are divorced from the
reality of spending needs in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, and from U.S.
national strategic priorities.

Analysis

Based on the empirical description, how can the slide from malign to
benign operations be explained? Or more precisely, why [have [U.S. and
Russian forces since]{.underline}]{.mark} [[2022]{.underline}]{.mark}
seemingly [[stopped antagonizing each other]{.underline}]{.mark} outside
the coast of Norway? Using Schelling's theory of brinkmanship and
Lebow's warning of inadvertent wars, [the empirical expectation suggests
that [in the post-Ukrainian environment, U.S. and Russian forces are
incentivized to move away from the Arctic brink of war;]{.mark}
[restraints on military activities]{.mark}]{.underline} and respect for
each other's sphere of interest [[is safer]{.mark} than "manipulating
the risk of war"]{.underline}. Analyzing this assumption, two
explanations seem particularly plausible: broader security concerns and
strategic necessity.

On broader security concerns, it can be argued that the Arctic
brinkmanship strategy has become too dangerous. Since the 2022 invasion,
hundreds of thousands of troops across the Euro-Atlantic region have
been mobilized and stand on a higher readiness status. U.S. and Russian
nuclear forces have thus increased their patrolling and attained a key
role in strategic deterrence.78 As the two nuclear powers are forced to
operate under more unpredictable circumstances, the current situation
seems to be characterized by a shorter strategic warning time. A
security environment where transparency, trust and confidence gradually
wither may lead to inadvertent spirals of escalation and war. As
assertive brinkmanship induces tension, and thus lower prospects for
nuclear escalation, the alternative of regaining control over the
situation is probably much safer for both protagonists. The alternative,
where crisis unfolds in ways that neither Russian nor U.S. defense
officials can fully control, is simply too risky after Russia's attempt
to invade Ukraine.

The [post-Ukrainian restraints]{.underline} thereby [signify an
important aspect of Arctic security, namely that U.S. and Russian forces
are intimately tied together by one mutual interest; neither side wants
to see the Arctic become a staging ground for a risky
brink]{.underline}man[ship]{.underline} [strategy]{.underline} that
subsequently leaves everyone worse off. On the contrary, [[by showing
restraints in the Norwegian and Barents Seas]{.mark},]{.underline} state
[[leaders]{.mark} i]{.underline}n Washington D.C. and Moscow [[are
allowed to take active steps away from the brink of
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. A plausible interpretation, therefore, is that
Ukraine is not worth an increased risk for an existential nuclear war,
neither as seen from a U.S. or a Russian perspective. As wars always
unfold in unexpected ways and consequently are hard to predict,
[managing the fear of inadvertent escalation is safer than continuing to
"manipulate the risk" in the Arctic]{.underline}.

#### The US and Russia both prioritize crisis management over escalation

The main finding is that
[[brink]{.underline}]{.mark}man[[ship]{.underline}]{.mark} [[ceased
because Russia's invasion in Eastern-Europe made it too dangerous for
the two rivals to continue a "tit-for-tat" logic]{.mark} outside
Norway.]{.underline} As Europe's largest war since 1945 unfolded, the
United States and Russia could no longer push each other towards the
brink of war. [In the post-Ukrainian security environment, [both nuclear
powers accept that inadvertent crises must be
mitigated]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Fearing the Ukraine war will escalate
beyond its borders, both parties have **tempered their Arctic saber
rattling**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As seen from Moscow and Washington
D.C., an Arctic salami-tactic aiming to install fear, uncertainty and
ultimately coerce the other part to step down in the Norwegian Sea has
become irresponsible. [[The fact that no provocative incidents have been
reported on either side of the Bear Gap signifies]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[tacit cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two protagonists.
U.S. and Russian state leaders stick to a "gentleman's agreement". This
is not out of sympathy for each other but out of fear, anxiety and a
mutual respect for each other's destructive power.

Paradoxically, therefore, [Russia's failed attempt to rapidly seize
Ukraine has led to more Arctic predictability]{.underline}. [[Russia's
failure to win]{.underline}]{.mark} decisively in Eastern Europe has, in
relative terms, led to more crisis stability outside Norway. The General
Staff's military blunder and failed coup d'état in Kyiv [[has become **a
regional tranquilizer**]{.underline}]{.mark} in one of the most
sensitive operational areas on Earth. The finding coincides with
conclusions drawn by Kristian Åtland et al., claiming

> \[...\] the dominant pattern of Russia's sea and air exercises on
> NATO's northern flank has changed significantly in the time that has
> passed since February 2022. Particularly noteworthy is the shift in

The NotPetya case is just one example. Nevertheless, the overall absence
of any meaningful instances of cyber escalation raises questions about
the extent to which the cyber domain is truly escalatory, let alone more
dangerous than other domains of warfare or strategic competition. In
other words, [[there is a significant mismatch between the cyber
escalation views]{.mark} held by many prominent experts [and the
available evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Three factors could
account for this gap.

First, differences between theoretical expectations and empirical
reality may stem from definitional issues---specifically, how those who
assert that the cyber domain is inherently escalatory define what
\"escalation\" means. As we discuss in detail later in this chapter, we
conceptualize escalation as something that changes the nature of a
strategic interaction between parties in a way that makes war more
likely or, if conflict is already taking place, more severe. According
to this definition, neither the sheer volume of cyber incidents in the
international system nor evidence of any type of response to a cyber
incident necessarily constitutes escalation.2, In contrast, some may
point to the observation of a high volume of cyber incidents or any form
of tit-for-tat dynamic (irrespective of the relative level of cost and
risk they may generate) as forms of escalation. However, [[the mere
presence of]{.mark}]{.underline} behavior or [[activity per se is not
sufficient evidence of escalation]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Alternatively, [some may acknowledge that cyber escalation has not yet
occurred, but it could be lurking around the next corner.]{.underline}
This reasoning has some parallels to academic debates about the success
of nuclear deterrence during the Cold War. Deterrence optimists opined
that the absence of nuclear war between the United States and Soviet
Union was due to the success of the strategy, while others have argued
that the world simply got lucky.28 [However, unlike the Cold
War,]{.underline} where neither superpower ultimately chose to unleash
its nuclear arsenal on the other, [the offensive employment of cyber
capabilities is hardly unthinkable]{.underline}. [[States have developed
and employed offensive cyber capabilities since the 1980s]{.underline}
[and their use is]{.underline}]{.mark} only [[becoming more
prevalent]{.underline}]{.mark}.29 [**[The sheer number]{.mark}** [of
cyber incidents that has occurred over the course of multiple decades
raises questions about how likely it is that cyber escalation would take
place in the future]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [given the **multi-decade
track record of cyber incidents not causing that
outcome**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That said, as part of our analysis in
this book we explore plausible hypothetical escalation scenarios, with a
focus on cyber operations that take place during conflict. Finally,
there may simply be a mismatch between the conventional wisdom about
cyber escalation and the empirical reality because the conventional
wisdom is wrong. This is the core contention of our book.

### 2nc -- no cyber impact

#### Cyber attacks won't escalate - empirically

google books, p. 6 //DH

[[Rather than dangerous escalatory spirals that threaten to spill over
into kinetic conflict, even the most heated interactions between rivals
in cyberspace are characterized by **limited**, tit-for-tat
retaliations]{.underline}]{.mark} that are often separated by
significant periods of time and [[that remain far below any
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} or armed attack
[[threshold]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[in a survey of cyber
incidents and responses between 2000 and 2014]{.underline}]{.mark},
Brandon [[Valeriano]{.underline}]{.mark} et al.
[[find]{.underline}]{.mark} that \"[[rivals tend to respond only to
lower-level \[cyber\] incidents and the response tends to check the
intrusion as opposed to seek escalation dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[The majority of cyber escalation episodes are at a low severity
threshold and are nonescalatory]{.underline}.\"20 Similarly, Sarah Kreps
and Jacquelyn Schneider conduct an original experiment to test different
logics of cyber escalation and find that cyber attacks \"create a
threshold that restrains the escalation of conflict.\"21 Specifically,
they find that Americans are less likely to support using kinetic force
to respond to a cyber attack, even when the effects of the latter are
comparable to other types of kinetic attacks.22

[[Even the most destructive cyber attack in
history]{.underline}]{.mark}, NotPetya, launched by Russia in the spring
of 2017 (reportedly using a leaked National Security Agency tool,
EternalBlue), [[did not cause escalation]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[[NotPetya wreaked \$10 billion worth of damage]{.mark} across the
globe]{.underline}, including to large multinational companies such as
Maersk, Merck, and FedEx.23 If cyber operations are likely to cause
escalation, NotPetya would be a prime contender, not only because of the
extent of the damage inflicted, but also because it was carried out by a
longstanding adversary of the nations it affected, which included some
of the most powerful states in cyberspace.

Yet, [[the response]{.underline}]{.mark} on the part of the countries
affected by NotPetya [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} rather
[[restrained]{.underline}]{.mark}. In February 2018---nearly a year
after the attack, seven allied nations (the United States, United
Kingdom, Denmark, Lithuania, Estonia, Canada, and Australia) issued
official statements attributing the NotPetya cyber attack to Russia.24
Concurrent with the coordinated attribution, Rob Joyce, then the White
House cybersecurity czar, threatened other ambiguous consequences in
remarks delivered at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Joyce
warned that the United States would \"work on the international stage to
impose consequences. Russia has to understand that they have to behave
responsibly on the international stage \... So we\'re going to see
levers the U.S. government can do to impose those costs.\"25 However, it
took nearly a year for allied governments to organize a public,
diplomatic attribution effort. [[The only observable costs that were
imposed on Russia were sanctions targeting a limited number of
individuals]{.underline}]{.mark} associated with the NotPetya attack as
well as with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election interference and cyber
penetration of the U.S. power grid.26 Of course, it\'s possible that
there were additional, covert measures taken to impose costs on Russia.
But if so, there was no demonstrable effect on any escalation dynamic
with Russia.

#### Crisis diplomacy and restraint disproves the impact

James **Lewis**, 20**21** -- Senior Vice President and Director,
Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, "Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy" 3/10,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy> //DH

[[The risk of escalation is **grossly
exaggerated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Countless Track II dialogues are
undertaken to reduce the risk of miscalculations that could lead a cyber
incident to escalate]{.underline}]{.mark} into kinetic violence. Yet,
[[in two decades of malicious cyber action, there has never been an
incident that has led to escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. While there
have been a few instances of unintended consequences and collateral
damage, these did not lead to an escalation of conflict. [We
can]{.underline} now [reject the initial hypothesis of miscalculation
and escalation as inaccurate]{.underline}. [The likely reasons there
have been no cyber incidents that resulted in escalation is that [states
maintain careful control of their most dangerous cyber
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and have devoted their own
strategies to reduce risk.]{.underline}]{.mark} We should learn from
their experience of tight leadership and control as we design our own
active policies.

A new strategy must use communications, messaging, and signals with
opponents, allies, and publics. This does not mean that every action
should be accompanied by a press release, but a new cyber strategy will
need to use public and private communications to shape opinion in ways
favorable to the United States and make it clear that our actions are
guided by international law and agreement. Adopting a more assertive
posture in cyberspace is in itself a message that will improve our
position with opponents. [[Diplomatic and public messaging can help
manage escalation risk]{.underline}]{.mark} and strengthen collective
responses with allies while shaping opponents' planning. Decisions on
timing and audience will be determined by the specifics of each action,
but our overall goal should be to end Strangelovian opacity.

32-64, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2022.2040584 //DH

Finally, an essential aspect of cyber operations' strategic effects is
the level of harm to the target. [Most malicious cyber activity to date
has not risen to a threshold of significant harm]{.underline}, violent
effects, or loss of life.44 This is **[especially]{.underline}** the
case **[when compared to other military capabilities]{.underline}**.45
That said, there are different ways to operationalize level of harm. One
potential metric is loss of life. [[To date, **no
one**]{.underline}]{.mark} has reportedly [[died as
a]{.underline}]{.mark} direct [[result of a cyberattack]{.mark},
[despite]{.mark}]{.underline} over [**[thirty years]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} recorded [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}
operations. 46 **[[Even in hypothetical catastrophic
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the cost in terms of [[human
casualties is]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [[low **compared to other
military capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, a common
worst-case scenario is a cyberattack on a power grid.47 However, the
2015 Russian cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid, the first known
example of an offensive cyber operation targeting a state's power grid,
did not lead to any reported casualties.48

It is also possible to measure the harm cyber operations inflict in
treasure rather than blood. According to this metric, the financial or
economic costs of cyberattacks are significant. For example, the total
cost of the most expensive cyberattack in history, the 2017 NotPetya
attack, is estimated at \$10 billion.49 However, governments have
largely avoided characterizing these operations as crossing an "act of
war" or "use of force" threshold.50 While still of strategic
consequence, cyber operations (especially absent physical violence)
appear to be perceived differently than other military operations.51

Given different approaches, we chose to measure level of harm in terms
of the target state's perception of a cyber operation's national
security consequences. Perception may not perfectly align with the
objective human or economic costs. For instance, the SolarWinds supply
chain breach, revealed in December 2020, compromised many US federal
government and private sector networks but did not cause loss of life.52
Nevertheless, the US government chose to activate the response process
outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 41, which applies to cyber
incidents that rise to a certain level of significance.53 This example
illustrates how the perceived level of harm ultimately is a political or
strategic assessment, rather than an objective measure of calculatable
damage.

Taken together, the strategic effects of most cyber operations are
relatively limited when compared to other types of military operations.
That said, different types of cyber operations vary in their level of
effects. These two points have implications for accommodative signaling.
Specifically, in the context of an international crisis, the relative
effects of a cyber operation inform how the adversary perceives the
intent behind the signal.54 In this sense, the key audience for a cyber
operation's effects is the adversary government. [[Because
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} operations [[lack the physical violence and
**permanent destruction**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[associated with other
military capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}---and may even be less
painful than some economic instruments, such as sanctions--- [[they
could **signal restraint** relative to other
options]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the choice of a disruptive cyber
operation that has temporary effects, in comparison to a destructive
cyber operation with longer-term effects, could also send an
accommodative signal. The sequencing of the cyber operation could also
inform its interpretation. For instance, if a cyberattack follows a
kinetic one, it could be perceived as a de-escalatory choice.

#### Cyberattacks are minor and manageable

University and a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute "The
Cyber-Delusion: Digital Threats Are Manageable, Not Existential" Foreign
Affairs, 3/22,

//DH

This contemporary approach to cyberthreats resembles the aftermath of
9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger terrorist attack
would soon take place. Then, as now, the threat is overblown. Although
occasionally dramatic, [[cyberattacks have turned out to be a
comparatively minor and manageable threat]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Far
[too much discussion]{.mark} around the issue [focuses on **worst-case
scenarios**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} fails to contextualize the
problem, and neglects to weigh the costs of cyberattacks against the
enormous value of the Internet and artificial intelligence. [[Most
commentary]{.underline},]{.mark} moreover, [[does not fully appreciate
the ability of the business sector]{.underline}]{.mark}---by far the
most tempting of targets for malevolent hackers---[[to **develop
effective countermeasures**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

CYBERWAR

Over the past decade, the global obsession with digital threats has
taken various forms, with a particular focus on the potential military
implications of emerging cyber-capabilities. To be sure, the military
needs to worry about keeping its communications and command and control
operations secure from hostile attackers. Any
[[disruptions,]{.underline}]{.mark} however, [[are more likely to be
instrumental or tactical than strategic]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Despite statements to the contrary, [[the U.S. military itself seems to
have recognized this]{.underline}]{.mark} reality. When Panetta
proclaimed in 2013 that cyber was "without question, the battlefield for
the future," political scientist Micah Zenko observed at the time that
[[the Pentagon was spending less than one percent]{.mark} of its budget
[on cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and an assessment from
2019 suggests it may be more like one-tenth of one percent. If those
funds prove adequate for the challenge, it would be something of a
bargain.

Americans typically believe that fundamental disagreements can be
overcome through the patient application of logic, reasoning, and common
sense. In international relations, creative [diplomacy is often seen as
the key to solving intractable problems]{.underline}. This applies to
negotiations with adversaries; [it is often assumed]{.underline} that
international tensions and the risk of war, especially [nuclear war, can
be alleviated through arms control]{.underline} agreements. Though a
noble sentiment, [this view is **naïve**, unsupported by history,
ignores contemporary realities, and is unlikely to produce the desired
positive results]{.underline}.

This stark conclusion runs counter to the American cultural belief that
disagreements among opponents can always be overcome with good faith
dialogue and discussion. Such a belief is premised on the notion that
all sides share a common desire to bridge their differences in ways that
lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.

This is a culturally egotistical view that assumes opponents share the
same goals and objectives as the United States and that, with due
diligence, the United States can succeed in concluding agreements that
not only enhance U.S. security but provide outcomes that make the
overall strategic environment more stable and secure.

The central problem with this belief is [that there is a growing body of
evidence supporting the proposition that U.S. adversaries do not share
such goals]{.underline} and objectives. In simple terms, both [China and
Russia]{.underline}---which pose the greatest threat to U.S.
security---[are not interested in "stability"]{.underline} as the United
States defines it. Rather, [their goal is to work against a stability
that preserves the status quo]{.underline}. [These opposing
objectives]{.underline} are what [make meaningful arms control
impossible]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- arms control fails

#### Communication with Russia won't build trust or lead to credible arms control -- Russia's objectives are [irreconcilable]{.underline} with the US

Indeed, [it strains credulity to believe that open lines of
communication will reduce tensions and improve the overall strategic
environment when the parties' goals and objectives are diametrically
opposed]{.underline}. Similarly, [it is unlikely that greater
"transparency" in armaments will lead Moscow or Beijing to accommodate
the U.S. desire to preserve the existing world order]{.underline}, which
they both believe is decidedly unfavorable to them. Tellingly, leading
Russian spokespersons have declared Russia to be already at war with the
United States. For example, [as the director of the Center for Middle
Eastern and Central Asian Studies in Moscow stated]{.underline}, "[The
United States is the enemy.]{.underline} It is our enemy. It is a
hostile state that aims to destroy our country... [We are at
war]{.underline}!"\[24\] [Such views]{.underline}, increasingly spread
by Russian propagandists, [reflect the worldview of]{.underline} a
Russian leadership that believes, as [Putin]{.underline} has stated,
[that Moscow is in an "irreconcilable struggle]{.underline}" with the
United States and the West over the nature of the world order. In this
struggle, [Western notions of arms contro]{.underline}l as a mutually
beneficial endeavor and a stabilizing factor in international relations
[do not align with Russia's strategic objectives and,]{.underline}
therefore, [cannot succeed.]{.underline}

#### Historically, arms control fails, causes cheating, and doesn't induce Russian restraint

The United States has historically deluded itself into believing that
U.S. strategic restraint would be reciprocated by adversaries; that
American accommodation and good will would prompt China and Russia to
become partners with the West rather than adversaries; that neither side
benefits from escalating tensions or instability; and that arms control
agreements would serve as a catalyst for improved political relations.
Each of these expectations, and similar optimistic hopes, have been
dashed by reality. As one trenchant analysis concluded, [the U.S.
government's "systemic delay" in calling out Russia's repeated arms
control violations, the "enduring lack of government openness regarding
the immense Chinese nuclear build-up]{.underline}," and the long-delayed
U.S. nuclear modernization program [have not produced the kind of
reciprocal restraint or improved political relationships that U.S.
decision makers expected]{.underline}. Indeed, [U.S. arms control policy
has been driven by self-deception]{.underline}.\[25\] And in today's
environment, there is little reason to believe the results will be
different. As the statement, often attributed (or misattributed) to
Albert Einstein, goes, "The definition of insanity is doing the same
thing over and over again and expecting different results."\[26\]

There are existing channels for communication that could be resuscitated
in an effort to seek greater insight into Russian posture and programs.
For example, although the Congress severely restricted U.S.-Russian
military-to-military interactions after Russia's illegal invasion of
Crimea in 2014, the legislation did not prevent military-to-military
communication.\[27\] But [even military-to-military discussions are
liable to prove disappointingly inadequate as long as Russian strategic
objectives remain contrary to U.S. national security
interests]{.underline}. Above all, the United States should refrain from
turning dialogue into a negotiation with the expectation that concrete
results can be achieved to the benefit of all parties as though this is
a zero-sum game. It is not. The United States must be prepared to
acknowledge and accept that [certain disputes are unbridgeable, no
matter how creative U.S. diplomacy is]{.underline} and how determined
American diplomats are in seeking common ground. [Even Russian officials
have acknowledged that political realities make meaningful arms control
negotiations with the United States unlikel]{.underline}y. As Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Peskov recently stated, "At the moment, it is very
difficult to imagine the beginning of such negotiations."\[28\]

#### Arms control assumes Russia and China are status quo powers

Institute for Public Policy. Previously, he served as Deputy Under

//DH

This advocacy wrongly assumes a commonality of interests and objectives
among Washington, Moscow and Beijing. For example, [suggesting that arms
control now will reverse China's nuclear ambitions ignores the reality
that Beijing's nuclear buildup underpins its desire to expand its
power]{.underline} and influence [at America's expense---]{.underline}a
goal that China is unlikely to abandon by agreeing to negotiate arms
limitations in the interest of "stability." Similarly, [decades of
Soviet/Russian arms control cheating, coupled with the massive buildup
of Russian nuclear forces]{.underline} and the plethora of nuclear
threats expressed by Russian officials, [show that Moscow has no
interest in "mutual restraint."]{.underline}

There is no reason to believe China or Moscow have any interest in arms
control to facilitate the U.S. definition of "stability." Rather, [they
seek to upset the existing world order with assertive behavior and
extensive military and nuclear capabilities]{.underline}---the
antithesis of stability. Wishful thinking that they share U.S. goals is
more likely to encourage further delays in the necessary and
long-overdue U.S. strategic modernization program, further undermining
the efficacy and credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, including
the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent. At a time when nuclear deterrence
is under significant stress, this would be dangerous folly.

## Brain drain DA

### Reverse brain drain link

#### Trump's Arctic science cuts are fueling brain drain to Europe and China

Birgitte Annie **Hansen**, 20**25** -- reporter, High North News "Nordic
Countries to Benefit From American Brain Drain" High North News, 5/15,
<https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/nordic-countries-benefit-american-brain-drain>
//DH

[The Nordic countries respond to Trump\'s political agenda with funds to
recruit foreign researchers]{.underline}. [The country is now facing a
massive \'brain drain\' after the administration\'s cuts in funding and
restrictions on research, creating opportunities for Europe and China to
**recruit American researchers**.]{.underline}

Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump has carried
out a massive attack on science and education. Mass firings, cuts in
funding, and limitations on language and research fields have led to
serious concern among researchers worldwide.

[Multilateral science cooperation plays an especially significant role
in Arctic research]{.underline} as the region comprises eight states and
is hit disproportionally hard by climate change compared to the rest of
the world.

Taking care of the region and its Indigenous peoples is a joint venture,
but it took a brutal hit when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and was
subsequently sanctioned, also in the research field.

Now, another major player, [the US, is stepping away from Arctic
science,]{.underline} potentially **[paving the way for outsiders to
take its place]{.underline}**.

Recruiting US researchers

In March, [75% of US scientists who answered a Nature poll said they
considered leaving the country after the Trump administration\'s attack
on science.]{.underline}

The [Nordic countries now see this as an opportunity to recruit talented
foreign researchers]{.underline}.

Last month, the Norwegian Research Council announced that it would
allocate NOK 100 million for international researcher recruitment. While
not exclusive to American researchers, the announcement especially
highlighted the dire situation US researchers face.

\"Academic freedom is under pressure in the United States, and it is an
unpredictable situation for many researchers in what has been the
world\'s leading research nation for many decades. We have had close
dialogue with the Norwegian knowledge communities and my Nordic
colleagues about the development,\" said Norwegian Minister of Research
and Higher Education, Sigrun Aasland (Labor), and added:

\"It has been important for me to find good measures that we can put in
place quickly, and therefore I have asked the Research Council to
prioritize grant funding schemes that we can implement rapidly.\"

The Norwegian Research Council is also currently trying to get an
overview of how the changes in the US are affecting research cooperation
between Norway and the US through a survey.

The Swedish Research Council also announced last month that it would
issue a call for grants of 2 million SEK to enable Swedish higher
education institutions and other research organisations to recruit
prominent researchers who are active outside Europe.

"With this call, we want to make it easier for higher education
institutions and other research organisations in Sweden to recruit
prominent research talents who are working outside Europe. We hope that
the researchers will establish themselves here and remain after the
initial grant period," says Katarina Bjelke, Director General of the
Swedish Research Council.

Sweden\'s Minister of Education, Johan Pehrson, also hosted a roundtable
with representatives from nine leading Swedish universities and research
institutions to help invite and attract American researchers and
students amid the political turmoil led by Trump.

\"When other countries close the doors on their researchers, we open
ours. \[\...\] In Sweden, we protect academic freedom. Here, researchers
will think freely, speak freely, and contribute to future solutions
without being limited by a political agenda,\" said Pehrson in a
LinkedIn post after the meeting, pointing to the situation in the US.

Likewise, the Research Council of Finland has launched a funding call to
improve universities' ability to recruit international experts to
Finland. The call has a preliminary total budget of 50 million euros and
will fund university recruitments between 2026 and 2030.

This will enable \"universities to recruit international, high-level
researchers from outside Finland, for example from the United States,\"
the council wrote in a press release.

Denmark is in the race to recruit US researchers as well. Brian
Mikkelsen, chief executive officer at The Danish Chamber of Commerce,
has issued a direct invitation to American researchers in a LinkedIn
post:

"To all the brilliant researchers in the US feeling uncertain right now:
Denmark is open -- and we need you!"

The Danish Chamber of Commerce and the Danish Society of Engineers (IDA)
are proposing a fast-track program aimed at bringing up to 200 US
researchers to Denmark over the next three years.

China sees opportunities

Yet, the Nordics are not the only actors seeing opportunities in the
US\' political havoc. Other European countries, such as France, Belgium,
and the Netherlands, have also launched funds to recruit scientists and
make it easier for them to relocate to Europe.

Last week, European Union commissioners announced €404.3 million in
incentives to lure international academics to the continent at the
Choose Europe for Science conference.

Arctic researchers, however, are worried about China establishing itself
as an irreplaceable actor in polar science. In recent decades, [China
has upped its focus on the Arctic]{.underline}, calling itself a
\'near-Arctic\' state.

Recent reports show that [the country is pursuing recently laid-off US
scientists]{.underline}, particularly those with expertise in artificial
intelligence.

In an interview with HNN last year, researcher Tim Reilly emphasized
that the governance of the Arctic will be influenced from space in the
future.

\"My view is that the existential risk in the Arctic is going to be
increasing governance from space, and the key enabler of that will be
AI.\"

Researcher Mia Bennett also highlighted the threat of China to Arctic
research in an interview with HNN earlier this year:

\"[China has already risen quickly as a scientific powerhouse in the
polar regions]{.underline} since the beginning of the 2000s. **[With
Russia and the US both out of the picture]{.underline}** so to speak,
[China will have ample opportunities to fund and lead Arctic
research]{.underline},\" she said.

### Japan soft power link

#### The current vacuum in US Arctic research is driving Japan and South Korean leadership

Nima **Khorrami**, 20**25** - formerly an Associate Research Fellow at
the OSCE Academy in Bishkek where he researched Iran "U.S. Retreat from
Arctic Research: A Strategic Opening for Japan and South Korea" 4/1,
<https://www.isdp.eu/u-s-retreat-from-arctic-research-a-strategic-opening-for-japan-and-south-korea/>
//DH

[As the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [retreats
from]{.underline} its engagement in [Arctic research, with drastic
funding cuts]{.underline}, mass firings, and a troubling
de-prioritization of climate science, [Japan and South Korea stand at a
critical juncture. This shift is not merely a crisis for American polar
science; it is a transformative opportunity for both countries to assert
themselves as legitimate and influential Arctic actors]{.underline}. [By
stepping into the vacuum left by U.S. retrenchment, Japan and South
Korea can both advance scientific discovery and enhance their
geopolitical stature]{.underline}, [furthering their long-term goals of
technological leadership and global influence]{.underline}.

Vacuum in U.S. Arctic Research

Recent developments in the United States have sent shockwaves through
the global scientific community. The U.S. government's [sweeping cuts
have decimated funding for research into climate change and Arctic
studies,]{.underline} a move that could undermine the very foundations
of American polar science. [With]{.underline} over [10 percent of the
National Science Foundation's staff dismissed]{.underline}, including
numerous experts whose specialized knowledge is critical for monitoring
and understanding the rapidly changing Arctic environment, [the nation
has effectively sidelined one of the most pressing scientific endeavors
of our time]{.underline}. This retreat is particularly concerning given
the existential threats posed by climate change, while the Arctic
occupies center stage in the global dialogue on environmental security.

Strategic Opportunity for Japan and South Korea

In this context, [Japan and South Korea are uniquely positioned to step
forward. Both]{.underline} countries [have advanced research
infrastructures, high levels of investment in science and technology,
and a strong interest in the Arctic's environmental and geopolitical
significance]{.underline}. [Japan, with its long-standing expertise in
polar research, and South Korea, with its state-of-the-art icebreaker
Araon and investment in Arctic logistics]{.underline} and
infrastructure, [have the necessary tools to take on a more prominent
role in Arctic research]{.underline}.

[Scientific initiatives in the Arctic are not just about research---they
are also a means of **exerting geopolitical influence**.]{.underline}
[In an era where technological prowess is a core element of national and
regional security,]{.underline} [Arctic research presents a critical
opportunity to integrate scientific excellence with strategic
imperatives. By expanding their Arctic presence, Japan and South Korea
can strengthen their credentials as key players in the region,
contributing to both scientific discovery **and broader security
dynamics.**]{.underline}

Strengthening Ties with Nordic States

The Nordic countries have long been at the forefront of Arctic affairs.
Their established presence and deep-rooted connections to the region
provide a natural partnership for Japan and South Korea. Collaboration
with Nordic states would allow both countries to leverage their
operational experience, local knowledge, and well-honed scientific
networks. Such cooperation is not only pragmatic but essential. [By
joining forces, Japan, South Korea, and the Nordic states can create a
**formidable consortium dedicated to Arctic research** and, perhaps even
more importantly, digital research infrastructure such as
high-performance computing and climate modelling]{.underline}.

Moreover, [working with Nordic partners can help Japan and South Korea
avoid duplicative efforts and fragmented policies. A unified approach to
Arctic research would promote a more coherent strategy that transcends
national boundaries, **reinforcing their credibility as serious Arctic
stakeholders**.]{.underline} This kind of multilateral engagement aligns
with both countries' broader foreign policy goals, allowing them to act
independently while drawing strength from strategic alliances.

Expanding Global Cooperation

While the immediate focus should be on strengthening ties with Nordic
states, Japan and South Korea should also look beyond. [The current
vacuum in Arctic research presents an opening for other non-Arctic
democracies with significant technological and scientific
capabilities.]{.underline} [Enhanced collaboration with the European
Union and Canada would enrich the scientific output of Arctic research
and contribute to a broader coalition of like-minded democracies
committed to transparency, collaboration, and sustainable
development]{.underline}.

[Such an inclusive approach would transform Arctic research into a truly
global enterprise]{.underline}. By working together, [these nations can
set international standards, share critical data, and jointly develop
technologies that benefit all.]{.underline} Japan and South Korea's
engagement in the Arctic can serve as a model for how non-Arctic states
can contribute meaningfully to the region while advancing their
strategic interests.

Conclusion

The stark reality of [U.S. cuts in Arctic researc]{.underline}h, while
alarming, [presents a unique strategic opportunity]{.underline}. [Japan
and South Korea have the capacity, resources, and institutional
expertise to step into this void and establish themselves as key players
in Arctic affairs]{.underline}. By harnessing their research excellence,
forging deep partnerships with Nordic states, and extending
collaboration to other non-Arctic democracies, they can not only advance
scientific understanding of one of the planet's most critical regions
but also enhance their own geopolitical standing.

[This is a moment for Japan and South Korea to demonstrate that
leadership in the 21st century requires both scientific innovation and
geopolitical foresight]{.underline}. In a world where science and
security are increasingly intertwined, both nations must seize this
opportunity to shape the global dialogue on Arctic research, paving the
way for a more secure, prosperous, and cooperative future for all.

### Congress hates the plan

#### Congress hates research cooperation

Richard L. **Hudson,** 20**22** -- editorial director at Science
Business "US needs to do better in science diplomacy, White House says"
Science Business, 9/29,

<https://sciencebusiness.net/news/us-needs-do-better-science-diplomacy-white-house-says>
//DH

Since World War II, science diplomacy has been a standard tool of
international relations -- and one largely invented by the US as its
economic and geopolitical clout increased. By 1960 the US accounted for
70% of global spending on R&D. Since then, although US public and
private R&D budgets have risen, spending in other countries has risen
faster. By 2019, the report says, the US share had dropped to 27% if
global R&D spending, while China's share had risen to 22%.

But [the main problem]{.underline}, many analysts say, [is]{.underline}
in [Congress]{.underline} itself. [Very few]{.underline} Congressmen
[have]{.underline} any [direct knowledge of science]{.underline} or
technology. And [for almost all, the main concerns in annual budget
negotiations are **domestic priorities** and political
sparring]{.underline}. [Congress has rebuffed repeated attempts over the
years to allocate more money for international research, or give
agencies more authority to form partnerships -- preferring to spend
science money at **home** rather than abroad]{.underline}.

#### Science diplomacy will be securitized and turn into an arena for geopolitical competition

However, international [scientific cooperation in the Arctic has never
been]{.underline} entirely [free from political influence]{.underline}.
The intensity of the [politicisation of Arctic scientific
cooperation]{.underline} has [increased]{.underline} particularly
d[uring]{.underline} periods of change, tension, or [shifts in
international politics]{.underline}, both in cases directly concerning
the Far North and in those occurring in other, often geographically
distant, parts of the world. This is the situation we are currently
facing. The tensions and geopolitical shift caused by the Russian
Federation's aggression against Ukraine and the Sino-American rivalry
are phenomena generating a growing sense of uncertainty and the rapid
bifurcation of international relations. Other factors include
technological advancements, such as in the field of artificial
intelligence, as well as the economic and political consequences of
climate change.

Despite the strong cooperative component of Arctic scientific
cooperation, which is linked to solidarity around research objectives,
[it is not devoid of a competitive dimension, which stems from the
nature of the research sector in every state]{.underline}. [Stakeholders
involved in scientific]{.underline} and innovative [activities compete
for research funding]{.underline}, rankings evaluating scientific
excellence, innovation, and the applicability of research. [This rivalry
extends to the transnational level, where researchers compete for
grants, access to scientific infrastructure, and opportunities to
publish in the most prestigious academic journals]{.underline}.

This is not the only level where competition is observed. Science
policy, including its external dimension, is a significant field of
activity for states, as well as non- state actors such as international
organisations, enterprises, and other non-state entities. There has long
been a consensus that [knowledge is a resource and a source of
both]{.underline}

[advantage and power.]{.underline} This is particularly evident in the
science-technology-innovation sector. [In a context of geopolitical
tensions and security threats]{.underline} at both the international and
national levels, all [these factors acquire new
significance]{.underline} and undergo redefinition, [involving their
politicisation and]{.underline}, in many areas,
s[ecuritisation]{.underline}.

#### The inclusion of threat discourse in the 1ac overwhelms the supposedly cooperative nature

EU institutions, acting as securitising agents, are undertaking a
securitising move by proposing amendments to existing regulations
concerning research security and the protection of scientific outputs,
including technology, know-how, and research data, in order to adapt
them to recent geopolitical developments. [Analysing the speech act
embodied in these]{.underline} normative [acts]{.underline} and their
drafts [reveals a discourse oriented towards the securitisation of
scientific research]{.underline}. [These documents **refer to
existential threats**]{.underline} (in general terms) [such as
international tensions]{.underline}, increasing vulnerability of
researchers to threats affecting research security, the rise of
[strategic competition]{.underline} and power politics, [and hybrid
threats]{.underline}, to which the scientific sector is particularly
exposed due to its openness and emphasis on international cooperation:
"Union-based researchers and innovators may be targeted to obtain
state-of-the-art knowledge and technology, at times using methods that
are deceptive and covert, or through outright theft or coercion, but
more often exploiting seemingly bona fide international academic
cooperation" (Council of the European Union 2024, C 3510).

The Council also highlights significant risks associated with the use of
scientific achievements by undesirable entities (states and their
intelligence services) for military applications. The document further
provides definitions of research security, critical innovation and
technology, and risk appraisal, describing the latter as: "\[...\] a
process in relation to international research and innovation cooperation
in which a combination of main risk factors is taken into consideration"
(Council of the European Union 2024, C 3510).

In 2024, the European Commission also published a White Paper on Options
for Enhancing Support for Research and Development in Dual-Use
Technologies (European Commission 2024b). These technologies, considered
as sectors, are referent objects that require specific actions to
mitigate the effects generated by the aforementioned existential
threats. The objective is to support research and development in
dual-use technologies at the EU level, referring to software and
technologies that can be utilised for both civilian and military
purposes. The document once again underscores efforts to reduce risk and
strengthen the EU's economic security. Among the strategically
significant technologies for which risk assessment procedures have
already been implemented are advanced semiconductors, artificial
intelligence, quantum technologies, and biotechnologies.

A similar narrative is found in the European Commission's document on
foreign interference in the research and innovation process: "Foreign
interference (FI) occurs when activities are carried out by, or on
behalf of, a foreign state- level actor, which are coercive, covert,
deceptive, or corrupting and are contrary to the sovereignty, values,
and interests of the European Union (EU)" (European Commission 2022).

The Commission, acting as a securitising actor, defines existential
threats as those originating externally to the system, in this case the
system being the European Research and Innovation Area, posed by third
states and non-state actors. However, [this document is significant not
only because of its security threat discourse but also due to its
broader aim: to establish a set of recommendations for the scientific
community]{.underline}, [enabling it to]{.underline} appropriately
[adapt to]{.underline} evolving challenges and the [increasing risks to
international security]{.underline}. It can thus be argued that the
referent object in this case is not only individual technological
sectors but also the broader research, innovation, and international
scientific cooperation sector. The latter category plays a dual role, as
[the scientific community]{.underline} also [serves as the]{.underline}
audience, i.e., the **[target of the securitising move]{.underline}**,
intended to prompt specific actions by academic and research
institutions. The document outlines concrete recommendations, such as:
(i) enhancing research data security; (ii) adjusting collaboration
frameworks with foreign researchers to mitigate the risk of undesirable
and high-risk incidents; (iii) developing a Code of Conduct for Foreign
Interference within academic and scientific institutions; (iv)
establishing a Foreign Interference Committee, responsible for managing
research data and intellectual assets in international collaborations;
as well as (v) providing advice and support to research groups involved.

# Russia Disadvantage

### 1nc -- appeasement DA

#### Ukraine's a [stalemate]{.underline} -- that will [exhaust]{.underline} Russia and force a settlement on [Ukraine's]{.underline} terms

Maria **Snegovaya and** Max **Bergmann,** 20**25** -- \*Senior Fellow,
Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at CSIS, and \*\*Director, Europe,
Russia, and Eurasia Program and Stuart Center at CSIS "Beyond
Appeasement: What is Feasible for Ukraine" Center for Strategic and
International Studies,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/beyond-appeasement-what-feasible-ukraine>
//DH

However, [Ukraine's position has not collapsed, nor is its
situation]{.underline} as [helpless]{.underline} as Trump makes it
appear. Ukraine faced a full-scale invasion from the second largest army
in the world and on paper is weaker than Russia in terms of population
size, economic resources, and weapons stockpiles. Still[,
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in the last three years [[has been able to
preserve its sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark} and existence as an
independent state[, [in addition to **militarily exhausting** and
**draining Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and trapping the
Kremlin [in a **military quagmire**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Ukrainian
army has even managed to achieve what was considered as utterly
unthinkable a decade ago---it has occupied Russian territory and
conducted successful intelligence operations inside Russia. Given these
major achievements, accepting Russian conditions highly unfavorable to
Ukraine is not justified by the current situation on the ground.
Instead, sustained [[Western assistance to Ukraine has strong prospects
of **ensuring a stalemate**]{.underline}]{.mark} able to both protect
European security and enable Ukraine to realize its goal of a future
inside the European Union.

Economically, [the war has put a significant strain on Russia's
economy]{.underline}. While Russia has qualitatively altered its
military potential (ramping up production and introducing new weapons),
the adjustment is not sufficient to change the stalemate on the ground.
Not even the assistance of Iran and North Korea has been able to
radically alter the situation. While it is not at risk of immediate
economic crisis, [Russia]{.underline} has reached capacity and [appears
to have reached supply-side constraints that prevent it from
significantly boosting its military and industrial base]{.underline}. As
economist Alexandra Prokopenko pointed out in her December 2024 report:
"The industry, including the military industry, has hit a ceiling in
terms of both production capacity, which is 81 \[percent\] loaded, and
labor resources: 73 \[percent\] of enterprises complain about a shortage
of personnel, the economy is almost at full employment---unemployment is
2.3 \[percent\]." With the record low unemployment rate, labor shortages
are particularly pronounced, limiting Russia's ability to increase
production. These shortages have contributed to accelerating inflation
despite the Central Bank of Russia spiking its key rate at the unusually
high 21 percent per annum. While state-investment driven growth reached
3.6 percent in 2023 and 3.8 percent in 2024, it is now expected to
decelerate to around 1 percent in 2025 and 2026. The combination of
accelerating inflation and slowing growth is threatening the Russian
economy with real risks of stagflation. Along with other factors, such
as depleting rainy funds, in the future these trends could combine to
create a "perfect storm" in the Russian economy. This is one of the
reasons behind Russia's eagerness to get sanctions lifted after signing
a temporary ceasefire deal.

[[Militarily]{.underline}]{.mark}, while having boosted industrial
production and so far maintained the inflow of volunteer recruits
(albeit at a constantly growing price tag[), [Russia
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [still [struggling to operate]{.mark} in the
current environment]{.underline}. By the end of 2024, half as many tanks
were left at Russian storage bases as there were prior to its 2022
invasion of Ukraine (and most of those left are of inferior quality).
[If the war continues, by the end of 2025 Russia is likely to run out of
stocked tanks]{.underline} suitable for restoration and repair, and its
capacity to produce new tanks from scratch remains limited to several
dozen per month. While being able to regenerate forces, the Russian
military has suffered from heavy losses and limitations in combat
capabilities, being unable to break through the front and turn this into
a war of maneuver. Instead, [[it has been]{.mark} [slowly grinding
Ukraine down]{.mark} with constant assaults: [taking several emptied
Ukrainian villages at the]{.mark} sky-high [cost of]{.mark} about
30,000--[45,000 casualties per mont]{.mark}]{.underline}[h]{.mark}. As
military analyst Dara Massicot suggests, the current state of the
Russian military in Ukraine is that "of a car that has blown its
transmission. It cannot get into the higher gears, because of the
damages and the casualties and the losses that it has sustained." [While
a Russian breakthrough remains possible if Ukraine reaches the point of
collapse, it for now remains unlike]{.underline}ly.

Altogether, in view of the existing economic and military constraints,
[Russia's ability to achieve its maximalist goals in Ukraine through
military means alone remains a distant prospect, so long as Western aid
to Ukraine continues and sanctions on Russia remain in
place]{.underline}. Thus, instead of peace negotiations, both Ukraine
and the West should now be focused on sustaining this stalemate.

Ukraine has so far been reluctant to shift to a defensive strategy and
had not constructed the same level of fortifications that Russia did in
the winter of 2022 and 2023 under the leadership of General Sergey
Surovikin. This is in part because Ukraine remained determined to regain
the offensive. As such, it prioritized generating new combat brigades,
as opposed to filling gaps in the brigades holding its defensive line.
Ukraine has recently shifted its approach to using new recruits to plug
holes along the front, which is a welcome shift.

[A key variable for Ukraine is the supply of Western aid]{.underline}.
The lapse of U.S. assistance from October 2023 to April 2024 led to a
withering of Ukraine's combat capacity. This represents the main danger
for Ukraine. While Europe has provided comparable military aid in total
to the United States, the aid from the United States has had greater
impact as it is more coordinated and has fewer disparate systems.
[Europe]{.underline}, however, [has the means to fill a gap left by the
United States]{.underline}. Should the United States end its military
assistance, Europe ought to seek to procure items from the United States
that it cannot immediately provide. For instance, European countries
through a Foreign Military Sale could buy 155 millimeter ammunition from
the U.S. Army, which has dramatically scaled up its production capacity.
Additionally, Europeans could seek to procure more air interceptors and
other vital munitions for Ukraine. There is discussion of the European
Union borrowing up to hundreds of billions of euros for defense, and the
European Union could use a portion of that, roughly \$10--20 billion, to
procure weapons from the United States. Buying what was formerly U.S.
foreign assistance to Ukraine will be a tough pill politically for
Europeans to swallow. Yet it is a necessary short-term step to ensure
Ukraine maintains its robust combat capacity until European production
ramps up. Europe therefore must also ramp up production to be able to
support Ukraine for the long term and refill their own stockpiles. This
means Europe has the capacity to backfill for U.S. security assistance
to Kyiv, assuming the willingness of the United States to sell its
weapons to Europeans that they can then transfer onwards to Ukraine.

Additionally, Russia's frozen central bank assets are largely in Europe.
The EU and European governments should take steps to unfreeze these
assets and transfer them to Ukraine. This will then provide financial
support for its economy and additional resources for its defense
industrial sector or to make additional procurements. These steps by
Europe will at the very least help freeze the conflict and prevent
Ukraine from losing the war through Western negligence.

[[By cutting off Russia's path to win]{.mark} the war]{.underline} on
the battlefield by demonstrating a long-term commitment to Ukraine,
[[Europe will]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[have created]{.mark} clear
[incentives for Russia to **seek a negotiated settlement to the
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than continuing to slam its exhausted
military against Ukrainian lines without the hope of a breakthrough.
Ukraine will know it can hold its position and has the resources to
maintain its defensive position. Furthermore, should Ukraine receive
greater quantities of advanced European weaponry, such as long-range
missiles and advanced fighter aircraft, it may be able to impose even
greater costs on Russia. [[With]{.mark} Russia's economy beginning to
reach constraints, its [military losses building, Russia over time may
be forced to drastically climb down from its maximalist position in
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}. A massive European effort that
forecloses the prospects of Russian victory may also crater Russian
morale on the front. Such swings can happen in war, particularly wars of
attrition. Regardless, a major European effort to support Ukraine and
further degrade the Russian military will also buy Europe time to rearm
itself and engage in the potentially arduous task of replacing U.S.
forces in Europe should there be significant drawdowns.

#### The plan [signals to Russia]{.underline} that cooperation in the Arctic is [more important]{.underline} than supporting Ukraine

Conclusion

[[Resuming cooperation in the Arctic Council, even at the working group
level,]{.underline} **[risks sending an unintended signal to the Russian
leadership]{.underline}** [that it can continue its aggression and war
crimes]{.underline}]{.mark} and still keep its position in the key
regional body, because it is too important a nation to be cast out and
[[because this **cooperation is 'too big to fail'**.
It]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[risks **messaging to Russia**
that]{.mark}, in the Arctic, [western countries are so keen to reassure
Rus]{.mark}sia that they are not a threat [that they are willing
to]{.mark} blur or [overlook]{.mark} the values that the West has so
vocally promised to [support in Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even more
worrying, [[if the continuation of Arctic cooperation with Russia seems
so important]{.mark}, [Arctic 7 countries may continue to **self-limit
their deterrence** and **military posture**]{.mark} in the region out of
fears as to what Russia could do---]{.underline}rather than taking full
advantage of the window of opportunity presented by Finnish and Swedish
accession to NATO and the Russian military\'s distraction and
depletion---at least in the near term---due to the government\'s costly
miscalculation in invading Ukraine.59

Russia is a master in only a few areas, but especially so in making use
of the weaknesses of its opponents, including through coercive and
subversive activities in the 'grey zone' and exploitation of the norms
and structures of international institutions.60 [In the Arctic, Russia
has been able to exploit the increasingly debunked myth of Arctic
exceptionalism and the West\'s willingness to reassure and engage in
diplomacy, seemingly without enduring consequences for Russian
aggression]{.underline}, for a long period. [While NATO and the Western
Arctic states strive to find a careful balance between deterrence,
censure, dialogue and reassurance, Russia has promoted its own mix of
coercion, subversion, ambiguity, deflection and
fear]{.underline}61---[of escalation, of arms races, of a new region of
conflict or of bringing the Chinese more prominently into Arctic
affairs.]{.underline}62 [[Resuming]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic Council
[[cooperation with Russia risks **proving the effectiveness**]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the latter\'s strategy of
[**[blackmail]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Russia is likely to continue to
use the Council as a bargaining tool, as a showcase of its power in the
region, and as fodder for propaganda narratives both at home and for
international audiences. It is likely also to continue to use the
Council to sow discord among its western members.63

Ultimately, while there are legitimate motives for wanting to maintain
the worthy ambitions of the Arctic Council, the price is too high to
pay. The Arctic is no longer exceptional, if it ever was, and neither
should the Council be insulated from the diplomatic fallout of Russia\'s
decision to attack Ukraine. [[**Official contact** with Russia should
remain suspended]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the Arctic 7 could then adopt
the model exemplified by the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, which has
strengthened practical cooperation measures in Russia\'s absence.64
[Projects involving Russia should remain paused [until Moscow is ready
to reverse its aggression against Ukraine]{.mark} and to engage in good
faith in the polar regions]{.underline}, rather than weaponizing Arctic
exceptionalism for its coercive ends.

#### Russia will use the plan to [force concessions]{.underline} on Ukraine as the price of agreement -- that paves the way for a Russian-led international order

[[Moscow is]{.mark} increasingly **[linking its Arctic diplomacy
to]{.mark}**]{.underline} its broader war-and-peace calculus on
[[Ukraine]{.mark}. [Early signs of US attempts to broker a]{.mark}
political [resolution to the war have reignited the Kremlin's hopes for
a "grand bargain", in which symbolic Arctic concessions---such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} downplaying Chinese involvement or
[[**reengaging with Western formats**---could be exchanged for more
substantive gains in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} and beyond.

Europeans must be ready for this tactic and avoid mistaking performative
gestures for real policy shifts. In particular, [[the Kremlin is likely
to court]{.underline}]{.mark} Western---especially
[**[American---interest in selective Arctic
cooperation]{.mark}**,]{.underline} using promises of investment access
to seek sanctions relief. [Even if Washington engages, European leaders
should remain firm and sceptical of such overtures and remind Trump that
[illusions of Russia's flexibility in the Arctic could be used to
obscure continued intransigence elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Even though Europeans have so far had little say in the Ukraine
negotiation process compared to the US, they still hold some sway in
their own right. [Europeans should]{.underline} use this to [distinguish
between genuine strategic threats and the Kremlin's performative signals
intended to pressure the West into restoring cooperation]{.underline}.
Despite its rhetoric, Russia is unlikely to withdraw from multilateral
Arctic frameworks or abandon UNCLOS mechanisms---particularly its shelf
extension claims---unless Western countries move to politicise these
processes, for example by stalling Russia's submissions due to
sanctions.

[[Moscow's]{.mark} underlying [objective is likely to restore pre-2022
formats of Arctic cooperation]{.mark}, particularly within the Arctic
Council, and thus rehabilitate its international standing **[without
altering its behaviour in Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Europeans
must therefore be clear that no return to "business as usual" in Arctic
governance is acceptable without a ceasefire or durable
settlement]{.underline} to the conflict.

On thin ice

The Kremlin is investing heavily in the Arctic and will continue to do
so. [[In the dreams of Russia's leaders, they will sit down
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the West---mostly with [[the US---and
**renegotiate the world order in their favour**.]{.underline} [They
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely try to [**[sell illusory
concessions]{.underline}** [in the Arctic]{.underline},]{.mark} among
others, [while sacrificing nothing]{.underline} of principle in order
[[to gain in Ukraine]{.underline}.]{.mark} Europeans must not
underestimate Russia's continued military build-up in the Arctic,
which---despite pressures elsewhere---remains a long-term Kremlin
priority. Instead, they must track these developments and prepare a
coherent NATO-based response, independent of shifting US leadership and
Moscow's thin veil of concessions.

[[Whenever international rules become meaningless,
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} naturally [[seek safety in
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} and military alliances. Given events in
Ukraine, can anyone blame Poland for almost doubling its army and
military budget, Finland for joining NATO or Saudi Arabia for pursuing a
defence treaty with the United States?

Unfortunately, [the increase in military budgets comes at the expense of
society\'s weakest members, as money is diverted from schools and
clinics to tanks and missiles]{.underline}. Military alliances, too,
tend to widen inequality. Weak states left outside their protective
shield become easy prey. [[As militarised blocs spread around the
world]{.mark}, trade routes become strained and commerce declines, with
the poor paying the highest price]{.underline}. And [as tensions between
the militarised blocs increase, [chances grow that a small spark in a
remote corner of the world will **ignite a global
conflagration**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since alliances rely on
credibility, [[even a minor challenge]{.mark} in an insignificant
location [can become a casus belli for a **third world
war**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Humanity has seen it]{.underline}]{.mark} all
[[before]{.underline}.]{.mark} More than 2,000 years ago Sun Tzu,
Kautilya and Thucydides exposed how in a lawless world the quest for
security makes everyone less secure. And past experiences like the
second world war and the cold war have repeatedly taught us that [in a
global conflict it is the weak who suffer
disproportionately]{.underline}.

[During the second world war]{.underline}, for example, [one of the
highest casualty rates was in]{.underline} the Dutch East
Indies---today\'s [Indonesia]{.underline}. When the war broke out in
eastern Europe in 1939, it seemed a world away from the rice farmers of
Java, but [events in Poland ignited a chain reaction that killed
about]{.underline} 3.5m-[4m Indonesians]{.underline}, mostly [through
starvation or forced labour at the hands of Japanese
occupiers.]{.underline} This constituted 5% of the Indonesian
population, a higher casualty rate than among many major belligerents,
including the United States (0.3%), Britain (0.9%) and Japan (3.9%).
Twenty years later Indonesia again paid a particularly heavy price. The
cold war may have been cold in Berlin, but it was a scorching inferno in
Jakarta. In 1965-66 between 500,000 and 1m Indonesians were killed in
massacres caused by tensions between communists and anti-communists.

[[The situation now is potentially worse than it was in 1939]{.mark} or
1965. It\'s not only that [a **nuclear war** would endanger]{.mark}
hundreds of [millions]{.mark}]{.underline} of people in neutral
countries. [[Humanity also faces the]{.underline}]{.mark} additional
[[existential threats of climate change and]{.underline}]{.mark}
out-of-control artificial intelligence ([[AI).]{.underline}]{.mark}

[As military budgets rise, so money that could have helped solve global
warming fuels a global arms race instead]{.underline}. And [[as military
competition intensifies, so the goodwill necessary for agreements on
climate change evaporate]{.mark}s]{.underline}. [[Rising tensions also
ruin the chance of reaching agreements on limiting an AI arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drone warfare in particular is advancing
rapidly, and the world may soon see swarms of fully autonomous drones
fighting each other in Ukraine\'s sky, and killing thousands of people
on the ground. The killer robots are coming, but humans are paralysed by
disagreement. If peace isn\'t brought to Ukraine soon, everyone is
likely to suffer, even if they live thousands of kilometres from Kyiv
and think the battle there has nothing to do with them.

Breaking the biggest taboo

Making peace is never easy. It has been said that nations march into war
through a barn door, but the only exit is through a mousehole. In the
face of conflicting claims and interests, it is difficult to assign
blame and find a reasonable compromise. Nevertheless, as wars go, the
Russo-Ukrainian war is exceptionally simple.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine\'s independence
and borders were universally recognised. The country felt so secure that
it agreed to give up the nuclear arsenal it had inherited from the
Soviet Union, without demanding that Russia or other powers do the same.
In exchange, in 1994 Russia (as well as the United States and Britain)
signed the Budapest Memorandum, promising to \"refrain from the threat
or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence\" of Ukraine. It was one of the biggest acts of unilateral
disarmament in history. Swapping nuclear bombs for paper promises seemed
to Ukrainians like a wise move in 1994, when trust in international
rules and agreements ran high.

Twenty years later, in 2014, the Russo-Ukrainian war began when Russian
forces occupied Crimea and fomented separatist movements in eastern
Ukraine. The war ebbed and flowed for the following eight years, until
in February 2022 Russia mounted an onslaught aimed at conquering all of
Ukraine.

Russia has given various excuses for its actions, most notably that it
was pre-empting a Western attack on Russia. However, neither in 2014 nor
in 2022 was there any imminent threat of such an armed invasion. [Vague
talk about \"Western imperialism]{.underline}\" or \"cultural
Coca-Colonialism\" [may be good enough to fuel debates in ivory towers,
but it cannot legitimate]{.underline} massacring the inhabitants of
Bucha or [bombing Mariupol to rubble.]{.underline}

For most of history the term \"imperialism\" referred to cases when a
powerful state such as Rome, Britain or tsarist Russia conquered foreign
lands and turned them into provinces. This kind of imperialism gradually
became taboo after 1945. While there has been no shortage of wars in the
late 20th and early 21st centuries---with horrendous conflicts ongoing
in Palestine and Israel, and in Sudan, Myanmar and elsewhere---there
have so far been no cases when an internationally recognised country was
simply wiped off the map owing to annexation by a powerful conqueror.
When Iraq tried to do that to Kuwait in 1990-91, an international
coalition restored Kuwaiti independence and territorial integrity. And
when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, there was never a question
of annexing the country or any part of it.

Russia has already annexed not just Crimea but also all the territories
its armies are currently occupying in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin
is following the imperial principle that any territory conquered by the
Russian army is annexed by the Russian state. Indeed, Russia went as far
as annexing several regions that its armies merely intend to conquer,
such as the unoccupied parts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk
oblasts.

Mr Putin has not bothered to hide his imperial intentions. He has
repeatedly argued since at least 2005 that the collapse of the Soviet
empire was \"the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", and
has promised to rebuild this empire. He has further argued that the
Ukrainian nation doesn\'t really exist, and that Russia has a historical
right to the entire territory of Ukraine.

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr **[[Putin is allowed to
win]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Ukraine, [this kind of [imperialism will
make a comeback all over the world]{.mark}. What will then restrain
Venezuela,]{.underline} for example, [from conquering Guyana, or Iran
from conquering the United Arab Emirates?]{.underline} What will
restrain Russia itself from conquering Estonia or Kazakhstan? No border
and [[no state could find safety in anything except armaments]{.mark}
and alliances. If the taboo on imperial conquests is
broken,]{.underline} then even [states]{.underline} whose independence
and borders won international recognition long ago [will face a growing
risk of invasion, and even of again becoming imperial
provinces.]{.underline}

[This danger is not lost on observers in former imperial
colonies]{.underline}. In a speech in February 2022 [the Kenyan
ambassador]{.underline} to the UN, Martin Kimani, [explained that after
the collapse of the European empires newly liberated people in Africa
and elsewhere treated international borders as sacrosanct, for they
understood that the **alternative was waging endless
wars**]{.underline}. African countries have inherited many potentially
disputed borders from the imperial past, yet, as Mr Kimani explained,
\"we agreed that we would settle for the borders that we
inherited...Rather than form nations that looked ever backward into
history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a
greatness none of our many nations and peoples had ever known.\"
Referring to Mr Putin\'s attempt to rebuild the Soviet empire, Mr Kimani
said that although imperial collapse typically leaves many unfulfilled
yearnings, these should never be pursued by force. \"We must complete
our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not
plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.\"

As Mr Kimani hinted, the driving force behind Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine is imperial nostalgia. Russia\'s territorial demands in Ukraine
have no basis in international law. Of course, like every country,
Russia does have legitimate security concerns, and any peace agreement
must take them into account. During the past century Russia has suffered
repeated invasions that cost the lives of many millions of its citizens.
Russians deserve to feel secure and respected. But no Russian security
concerns can justify destroying Ukrainian nationhood. Nor should they
cause us to forget that Ukraine too has legitimate security concerns.
Given events of the past decade, Ukraine clearly needs guarantees
against future Russian aggression more robust than the Budapest
Memorandum or the Minsk Agreements of 2014-15.

Empires have always justified themselves by prioritising their own
security concerns, but the larger they became the more security concerns
they acquired. Ancient Rome first embarked on its imperial project
because of security concerns in central Italy, and eventually found
itself fighting brutal wars thousands of kilometres from Italy because
of its security concerns on the Danube and Euphrates. If Russia\'s
security concerns are acknowledged as a legitimate basis for making
conquests on the Dnieper, they too may soon be used to justify conquests
on the Danube and Euphrates.

## Uniqueness

### U -- stalemate solves

#### Stalemate isn't sustainable for Russia -- it will be forced to accept a settlement

Thomas **Wright**, 20**25** -- senior fellow on foreign policy at the
Brookings Institution "How can Europe defend Ukraine?" 6/17

<https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-can-europe-defend-ukraine/> //DH

Therefore, Ukraine's military objective in the war cannot be the
expulsion of Russian forces from Ukraine because it is simply not
achievable. [An attainable goal is to change Moscow's strategic
calculus, so it is willing to accept a settlement to end the war on
terms]{.underline} that are also **[acceptable to Kyiv]{.underline}**.
That settlement would not impose restrictions on the size of Ukraine's
military or on Western assistance.

[The only plausible way]{.underline} of achieving this [is]{.underline}
what I call "**[asymmetrical attrition in a stalemate]{.underline}**."
[This means that Russia can only take small slivers of
territory]{.underline} (basically a stalemate[) at an enormous
cost]{.underline} (asymmetrical attrition). [Russia is
suffering]{.underline} approximately [1,500 casualties a
day]{.underline} and over 900,000 in total since the beginning of the
war. [Ukraine's casualty rate is significantly lower]{.underline}, even
weighting for its smaller population. [If this rate of attrition
continues, the war may be unsustainable for Russia without a wider
mobilization, which]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin does not want to
do]{.underline}. In late March, Putin conscripted 160,000 people, the
largest conscription since the beginning of the war, which was a sign of
his manpower shortages.

[To convince Russia that this is the likely alternative to a negotiation
on acceptable terms to Kyiv, Ukraine needs to be able to fight a
prolonged defensive war.]{.underline} It does not need to show that it
can conduct a major offensive, although it should be ready to exploit
real opportunities for small tactical advances if they present
themselves. The key question is: Can Ukraine accomplish this without
additional support from the United States?

First, the good news: Ukraine is not as reliant on the United States as
it was in the first three years of the war. The Biden administration's
decision to surge weapons to it in the final months of the
administration bought Ukraine time. The Biden administration also helped
Ukraine crank up its own defense industrial base, producing vast
quantities of attritable drones and other weapons. European nations are
doing more to support Ukraine's security---for example, the Czech
Republic has played a leading role in providing 155mm munitions to
Ukraine.

#### The current stalemate is destroying Russian political will -- it's likely to lose the war

Michael **Kimmage,** 20**25** - director of the Kennan Institute at the
Wilson Center in Washington. "Russia Has Started Losing the War in
Ukraine" Foreign Policy, 5/19,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/05/19/russia-military-putin-war-ukraine-nato-europe/>
//DH

But for Russia, Ukraine is not Syria, and it is not Georgia. Syria was a
far-away adventure where Russia's retreat can be swept under the carpet.
Georgia is stuck in a holding pattern, vacillating between Russia and
the West, which is no disaster for Moscow---whereas **[Ukraine is a
disaster for Moscow]{.underline}**. In Ukraine, [Russia's military is
stalled while deaths and casualties mount]{.underline}. Putin has no way
out of the war---other than to admit a version of defeat. The Kremlin
can try to hide the war's misery from Russians but only to the extent
that it can tell the war's story. Putin cannot as effectively erase
evidence of a faltering economy. Nor can he offer Russians any coherent
political promise other than endless Putinism. [Slowly and not yet
suddenly, Russia is starting to lose the war.]{.underline}

Long wars demand integrated efforts. [Military aims rest on diplomatic
capacity and economic heft, which in turn rest on political will. Russia
is struggling in each of these domains]{.underline}. The problem for
Putin is that the military and diplomatic challenges of the war compound
one another, as do the economic and political challenges. [Were the war
going well]{.underline} or were it an obviously defensive war, diplomacy
might be peripheral, uncertainty and economic hardship might be
bearable, and **[political discontent could be put on
hold]{.underline}**. This was the Soviet Union in World War II. With his
massive war against Ukraine, Putin is in almost the opposite position.
Nor can he procrastinate by narrating his way out of this strategic
cul-de-sac. With an autocrat's toolkit, he can only postpone the
eventual reckoning.

Russia faces two serious military dilemmas. One is its own inability to
advance. In some technical sense, m[omentum is on Russia's side, as it
takes square miles of Ukrainian territory, but this momentum is **going
nowhere**]{.underline}. [For months, Russia has tried and failed to
take]{.underline} the Ukrainian town of [Pokrovsk. Its failure has been
accompanied by enormous losses]{.underline}: an estimated 790,000 killed
or injured since the beginning of the war (plus 48,000 missing),
including more than 100,000 casualties this year alone. By the end of
2025, at this rate, [Russia will have over a million
casualties]{.underline}, and its strategic situation will not be any
better than it was in 2022. Putin has no easy way to alter a trajectory
that translates (if unaltered) into stalemate. Mostly war zones, the
territories that Russia controls in Ukraine are of no material benefit
to Russia.

Russia's other military dilemma is Ukraine. When Russia failed to
deliver a knock-out blow in 2022 and to split Ukraine down the middle,
Putin had a choice between a reduced war and a war on civilians across
Ukraine. He went with the war against civilians---not to be seen as
backtracking and to compel Ukrainians to surrender. This decision also
backfired. The brutality of the Russian occupation coupled with
countless assaults on civilians and civilian infrastructure convinced
most Ukrainians that they had to fight. [Ukraine is poorer and smaller
than Russia,]{.underline} not ideally suited to a war of attrition, and
on the battlefield Ukraine is acting alone. [These circumstances
matter]{.underline}, of course, [though not as much as]{.underline}
[Ukraine's morale and its formidable ability to innovate]{.underline}
(such as in drone warfare), which among other things is a function of
Ukrainians' morale.

#### Ukraine has enough support to drastically alter Russian morale

Paul **Hockenos,** 20**25** - is a Berlin-based journalist. "Ukraine's
Narrow Path to Victory Without Trump" Foreign Policy, 6/9,

<https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/09/ukraine-victory-intelligence-diplomacy-europe-defense-trump/>
//DH

Ukraine's battlefield prospects against Russia clearly dimmed when the
Trump administration took office. Trump has consistently signaled that,
at the very least, military aid resembling anything close to that the
Biden administration bankrolled would not be forthcoming. Ukraine's
route to a secure and sovereign future thus became much narrower---so
much so that a dark pessimism descended on many European observers.

But the excessive [[gloom is uncalled for]{.underline}]{.mark}---and
counterproductive. [[Ukraine already produces the world's most
advanced]{.mark} front-line [weaponry and innovates]{.mark}]{.underline}
with cunning [[on the battlefield.]{.mark} [It has already routed Russia
in the Black Sea theater and]{.mark}]{.underline}, recently, [[pulled
off another]{.underline}]{.mark} bombastic [[coup in Operation Spider
Web]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[targeting 41 aircraft with drone strikes
deep into Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and likely destroying at least 10
of them. As long as the Ukrainians' determination to fight on is
undiminished, there are strategies available to help them win---even
without U.S. support at the levels to which they have become accustomed.

Many attendees at last week's Black Sea Security Forum in Odesa,
Ukraine, were engaged in the wishful thinking that U.S. President Donald
Trump will eventually come around on Ukraine and embrace the country as
an ally deserving of tens of billions of dollars of continued support
once he grasps that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been playing
him all along, betraying his duplicity in several rounds of cease-fire
talks.

But a far more likely outcome is that Trump blames both Moscow and Kyiv
for failing to do as he instructs and withdraws from active involvement
in diplomacy while also discontinuing U.S. arms supplies to Kyiv.

But crucially, the Trump administration will not abandon Ukraine
completely. U.S. policymakers---among them a majority of
Republicans---realize that there is too much for Washington to lose from
a potential Ukrainian collapse. The United States can, and probably
will, extend offers similar to previous support where it doesn't cost
Washington excessively.

[Washington insiders who deal with the Trump administration on Ukraine
say that it will not suspend Ukraine's access to the U.S. satellite
intelligence]{.underline}, which has been crucial for Ukraine's
battlefield targeting. This advanced satellite imagery is absolutely key
for Ukraine: It is its eyes and ears.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the U.S. National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has lent Ukraine access to a commercial
satellite imagery platform that uses high-resolution radar imagery to
track Russian troop movements, which the Ukrainian military uses to plan
counteroffensives. As the New York Times reported, the Ukrainian
military depends overwhelmingly on coordinates from U.S. intelligence
for most of its operations involving long-range strikes.

Critically, this is one of the few pieces of technology that neither the
Ukrainians nor their European allies can substitute. Without it, as
Ukraine was for about a week in March---when the Trump administration
was roughing up Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky---Kyiv would find
itself at an ominous disadvantage. But this won't happen, because
continued Ukrainian access enables the United States to have a finger in
the war rather than stand on the sidelines as a useless observer---and,
since it's already in place, costs very little.

Intelligence sharing aside, [[Ukraine's victory now hinges on Europe
stepping up]{.mark} as its dominant ally]{.underline} and
benefactor---[[and there is every sign that **it is doing just
that**]{.underline}]{.mark}, if slowly. [[Europe's leading
powers]{.underline}---]{.mark}France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and
Poland---[[are in the process of asserting leadership]{.mark} in the
Russia-Ukraine war, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} to that end, together with
EU institutions, they have [[made prodigious sums available to weaponize
Ukraine and cover its bills]{.underline}]{.mark}. The European Union
already has a package of stiffer sanctions against Russia in progress.

The Europeans' pledges of support are more than just lip service: They
understand the centrality of this war to long-term European security, so
much so that it is now their top priority. There has been a flurry of
diplomatic activity since Friedrich Merz took the Germany chancellery on
May 6, and that activity amounts to more than mere words. [[With an
economy nine times greater than Russia's, the European Union is already
in the process of replacing]{.underline}]{.mark}---and it has the
potential to surpass---[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[as Ukraine's chief
supplier]{.underline}]{.mark} of armaments and financial aid.

From 2021 to 2024, EU members' defense budgets jumped from 218 billion
euros (\$248 billion) to 326 billion euros (\$372 billion), and a
further increase of at least 100 billion euros (\$114 billion) is
projected by 2027. The EU institutions are now involved on an entirely
new level: The European Commission is bolstering the European Defense
Union, which will help build out the bloc's defense industry and
stimulate ammunition production.

In March, the program that was originally titled ReArm Europe was recast
as European Readiness 2030, with the aspiration to leverage 800 billion
euros (\$912 billion) for defense spending over five years. So, too,
have individual countries reached deeply into their pockets, well aware
that they are on their own now.

In March, for example, Merz---then the incoming German
chancellor---created a 500 billion euro (\$570 billion) debt pool for
defense expenditures and German infrastructure. This year, two non-EU
members---the U.K. and Norway, both part of the "coalition of the
willing" that was launched by France and the U.K. after the Munich
Security Conference in February---pledged an additional 450 million
British pounds (about \$600 million) of military support to Kyiv.

Germany's IWF Kiel calculates that in order to offset U.S. aid to
Ukraine---both military and fiscal---Europe needs to double its
expenditures. The recently announced new monies are more than enough to
do this: Since February 2022, U.S. aid has totaled about \$66.9 billion
in military assistance to as well as more than \$50 billion in
nonmilitary financial aid. (Nota bene: The Center for Strategic and
International Studies estimates that 90 percent of that military aid is
paid out within the United States to contractors to build new weapons or
to replenish arms sent to Ukraine from American stockpiles.)

Certainly, Europe will be at pains to replace some of the U.S.
hardware---in particular, air defenses. Currently, Washington provides
the lion's share of rocket launchers such as HIMARS systems and ATACMS
missiles, howitzer ammunition, and long-range anti-aircraft systems such
as Patriots. (Europe already does the heavy lifting in terms of
howitzers and battle tanks.)

"European missile defense systems can help defend Ukraine against
Russian cruise missile strikes," researchers argued in a May Center for
Strategic and International Studies report, "but the U.S. Patriot is the
only NATO system that can defend against Russian ballistic missile
attacks." In addition to the investment in their own arms industries to
manufacture this until-now-donated U.S. hardware, the Europeans can
simply purchase these systems from the United States. That's a deal that
Trump has said interests him. And there are other potential sellers,
too, such as South Korea and Isreal.

[The new ace in the hole is Ukraine's superlative defense
sector]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} has blossomed into one of
Europe's most ingenuous and advanced arms industries---and [produces
much of what its military requires]{.underline} (including roughly 40
percent of all weaponry) at a fraction of the cost and twice as fast.
For every billion that the United States has paid out to its own
industry, the Europeans can get several times as much from the
Ukrainians---and without the same transfer headaches and costs. In
addition to its hailed drone production, Ukraine reports that it
produces more howitzers and artillery systems than all of Europe
combined. The Ukrainians know exactly what they need and are constantly
tweaking their hardware to conditions on the battlefield.

The Danes have paved the way in purchasing weapons for the Armed Forces
of Ukraine directly from Ukrainian manufacturers. The so-called Danish
model appears to be a hit: This year, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Norway,
and Iceland will fork out a combined 1.3 billion euros for Ukrainian
artillery, strike drones, missiles, and anti-tank weapons that were
created in Ukraine. About 830 million euros of this sum stems from the
EU, which is drawing on the windfall profits of frozen Russian
assets---an overdue and highly fortuitous move.

Ukrainians are understandably worn down from the war and eager for a
return to normalcy. [But [Putin's strategy to destroy morale by bombing
civilians is not working. It is the Russians who have to worry about
morale as ever more troops die]{.underline}]{.mark} and sanctions choke
the country's economy. The Ukrainians---and Europe can thank them for
it---are showing a resourcefulness and resilience that earns them the
West's support. If the United States is not going to be there for them,
then Europe must---and it can. In fact, it's in the process of happening
now.

#### Ukraine's superior logistics and defense production means it will win a war of attrition

Alina **Frolova**, 20**25** - is Deputy Chairman the Centre for Defence
Strategies in Kyiv. "Is Ukraine Losing the War?" 1/17, Centre for
European Policy Analysis,

<https://cepa.org/article/is-ukraine-losing-the-war/> //DH

Who Has the Upper Hand?

[In a war of attrition, logistical sustainability is decisive. Russia's
logistics have been weak]{.underline} from the start, [and rely heavily
on railways]{.underline}. While a well-developed railway network in
occupied Ukrainian Donbas has favored a Russian advance, [this will be a
dwindling asset as its forces move further away from the
railheads]{.underline}.

[Supply routes inside Russia have been targeted by long-range strikes on
hubs, munition depots, and production sites]{.underline}. Russia's
inability to protect its territory --- a consequence of its
offensive-oriented military doctrine --- further exacerbates these
vulnerabilities.

In contrast, [defense production for Ukraine is mainly safe from Russian
attacks because most factories are located abroad]{.underline};
[Ukraine's logistics and supply are bolstered by international
partnerships and decentralized domestic production.]{.underline}
[High-tech defense manufacturing has surged]{.underline}, supported by
private initiatives and Western investment. [Ukraine's air defense
generally outperforms Russia's]{.underline}, protecting key assets and
production lines.

Defense Production Trends

Despite numerous statements that [Russia]{.underline} spends about 8% of
GDP on defense, the Kremlin could provide tanks, armored vehicles, and
artillery by withdrawing and restoring equipment manufactured in the
Soviet era. Its [defense production has been hard hit and Russian output
numbers]{.underline}, for example of tanks[, are highly suspect. Its
ability to sustain its military is dwindling.]{.underline}

[Tanks, artillery, and other critical equipment are being depleted
faster than they can be replaced]{.underline}. [OSINT data suggests that
Russia's stockpiles of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles may be
exhausted by 2027, with artillery and rocket launchers running out in
2025-2026]{.underline}. [Sanctions and a lack of innovation hinder
Russia's capacity to modernize its arsenal]{.underline}. Add in the
analytical prognoses on Russia's economic stagflation in the second half
of 2025, and even with supplies from Iran and North Korea, its situation
doesn't look good.

[Ukraine,]{.underline} on the other hand, [has dramatically increased
its defense production]{.underline} (from 1.3 billion hryvnia in 2022 to
20 billion hryvnia (\$474m) in 2024), supported by EU investments.
Moreover, Ukraine's economy, despite severe losses, demonstrates
resilience, with forecasts predicting GDP growth of 2.5%---7% in 2025,
combined with quite a limited inflation, a high level of National Bank
reserves, and stable banking system. Western financial support ensures a
stable fiscal foundation, contrasting sharply with Russia's economic
fragility and declining defense production capacity.

#### US support for Ukraine is increasing -- the longer the stalemate, the greater the chance Russia can't sustain the war economically

Wojciech **Jakóbik,** 20**25** - founder of the Energy Security Center
"Key to Russia's defeat lies in its economy" Kyiv Independent, 6/9,
<https://kyivindependent.com/key-to-russias-potential-defeat-lies-in-its-economy/>
//DH

As the war in Ukraine grinds on, attention remains fixed on the
battlefield. But [Russia's most vulnerable flank is not in the trenches
--- it's in the treasury]{.underline}. The West, and especially the
United States, holds [economic levers]{.underline} that [could
push]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin toward **serious negotiations** or
even **collapse his ability to sustain the war
altogether**]{.underline}.

[Recent developments signal a shift in Washington's posture. Military
aid to Ukraine has resumed, and a landmark U.S.-Ukraine resource
agreement was signed]{.underline} on April 30.

More significantly, [senators]{.underline} --- led by Republican Lindsey
Graham --- [are advocating sanctions that would impose 500% tariffs on
Russian oil]{.underline} and commodity exports. Moscow has reacted with
alarm, calling this initiative a "counteroffensive from the American
deep state." It's no bluff. The Kremlin is right to be worried.

[What truly threatens Putin's war machine is energy revenue ---
or]{.underline} rather, **[the loss of it]{.underline}**. The Russian
economy is deeply dependent on oil and gas exports, with the 2025
federal budget based on an oil price of \$70 per barrel. But Russian
Urals crude is now priced around \$60, and could fall further. Saudi
Arabia, frustrated by non-compliance within OPEC+, is allowing oil
prices to drop, potentially triggering a price war. Riyadh has openly
stated it can withstand a prolonged period of low prices --- a veiled
threat aimed at Moscow and other OPEC+ defectors.

The effects are already visible. [Russia has slashed its oil revenue
forecast]{.underline} for 2025 [by 24%,]{.underline} with the Finance
Ministry predicting a drop from 11 trillion to 8.3 trillion rubles. [The
country's oil production could decline by up to 50% by
2030]{.underline}, largely because newer reserves are technically
difficult and capital-intensive to extract. That's why Moscow is quietly
seeking Western --- specifically U.S. --- expertise to develop these
fields. A coordinated, firm sanctions regime from Washington and
Brussels could shut that door completely.

Simultaneously, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are deepening their energy
partnership, particularly in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Saudi Aramco
has reportedly signed memoranda of understanding with American LNG
exporters like NextDecade and Sempra. The latter already holds a major
supply contract with Poland's Orlen, and the U.S. is now poised to
become a key alternative gas supplier to Central and Eastern Europe.
These investments will expand global LNG capacity and bring prices
closer to the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark --- lowering Europe's dependence
on Russian gas.

Poland and Ukraine are moving to capitalize on this trend.

Warsaw has announced plans for a second floating LNG terminal, which
could eventually supply Slovakia and Hungary --- two nations
historically reliant on Russian gas. Ukraine, meanwhile, is gaining
investor interest now that the U.S. has committed to a joint
Reconstruction and Investment Fund, funded through future resource
extraction projects. For the first time since the full-scale invasion
began, Western business sees a path forward in Ukraine\'s energy sector.

[The implications for Russia are grave. Military spending has ballooned
to 6.3% of GDP]{.underline} --- its highest level since the Cold War ---
[while the budget deficit continues to rise.]{.underline} [To fund its
war]{.underline}, [the Kremlin is raiding reserves, raising taxes, and
cutting social programs.]{.underline} Absent war spending, Russia might
already be in recession. The regime increasingly relies on military
conflict to justify domestic hardship and consolidate power.

But the geopolitical landscape is shifting. The combination of [low oil
prices]{.underline}, [expanding LNG competition, and targeted U.S.
sanctions could inflict sustained economic damage]{.underline} on Russia
without risking American or European lives. [Energy
diplomacy,]{.underline} not just weaponry, [could determine the outcome
of this war]{.underline}.

#### Protracted stalemate will cause Russia to genuinely negotiate -- it's not economically sustainable in the long term

Lawrence D. **Freedman,** 20**25** - is Emeritus Professor of War
Studies at King's College London. "Why Putin Still Fights: The Kremlin
Will End Its War in Ukraine Only When It Knows That Victory Is
Impossible" Foreign Affairs, 6/18,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/why-putin-still-fights> //DH

What might make the difference? [Moscow must be concerned by the
increasing tempo of Ukrainian attacks]{.underline} against an array of
military and economic targets on Russian territory. The most
spectacular---such as the early June Operation Spider's Web, using
low-tech, short-range drones to destroy more than a dozen Russian
strategic bombers at air bases far from the border---were a testament to
Ukrainian audacity, operational ingenuity, and technical prowess. Such
strikes are embarrassing and disruptive to Russia but still unlikely by
themselves to force Moscow to reappraise its war strategy. They also
have not fundamentally changed the basic dynamics on the frontlines,
although attacks on logistic hubs, arms depots, and command centers
certainly help.

Since early in the war, analysts have attempted to work out at what
point one side or the other would run out of vital supplies---armored
vehicles, artillery pieces, shells, missiles, air defenses, and so on.
In some areas, stocks have been seriously depleted. Ammunition is
currently less of a problem for Ukraine, but its air defenses are a
significant concern. Russia now appears to lack the capacity for
maneuver warfare. Yet both sides keep going with help from their
friends, and they have relied increasingly on capabilities, notably
drones, when domestic mass production is possible and relatively
affordable so that expendability is far less of a worry.

The most perplexing issue is manpower. This has been and remains a
serious matter for Ukraine. Although numbers are now up (Zelensky claims
to be mobilizing 27,000 a month), there is still resistance in Kyiv to
conscripting 18-to-24-year-olds. On the Russian side, Moscow accepts
heavy casualties for small gains and continues to find troops to send to
the front despite the high risk of death and injury. Several Western
analyses have concluded that the war has already cost Russia a million
casualties.

Russia appears to have a Soviet-style readiness, which arguably goes
back to imperial times, to throw troops at enemy defenses in the hope
that some will get through. Current Russian strategy, for example,
relies on small groups of troops on buggies, bikes, and foot advancing
in the knowledge that most will not reach Ukrainian lines but that
enough might to occupy some new ground.

Thus far, [the Kremlin has found troops without resorting to a
full-scale mobilization]{.underline}. This is [because of a bounty
system that uses hefty]{.underline}---and
ever-increasing---[payments]{.underline} to recruits. Since recruits
largely come from the poorer parts of the country, the war also has a
redistributive effect. Russia's war machine is a bit like an extractive
industry, in which as long as there is material that can be mined, it is
good business. Still, in the end, the supplies will be limited. [There
are already doubts about how much more]{.underline} manpower [the state
can buy]{.underline} and at what price. The question remains whether at
some point the Kremlin will have to resort to more coercive methods.

[This cost relates to Putin's wider problem of whether the Russian
economy can continue to sustain this level of military
effort]{.underline}. Moscow has confounded Western expectations that
severe sanctions would wreck the country's economy and has instead
enjoyed a couple of years of high growth. This is the result of a
combination of shrewd macroeconomic management, high energy prices, the
support of China and other Russian energy clients in circumventing
sanctions, and the war boom triggered by enormous defense production.
But beginning [in late 2024, there were signs that Russia's militarized
economy was beginning to severely overheat, with labor shortages, high
inflation, and high interest rates]{.underline} discouraging investment.
For the first months of 2025, the Trump-induced downturn in
international trade pushed down oil prices, putting further pressure on
Russian coffers.

BEYOND DEADLOCK

Ukraine began 2023 hoping that it could win the war with a
counteroffensive. When that failed, and with the U.S. Congress refusing
to vote for more assistance to Kyiv, Russia was optimistic that it would
be able to pull ahead in 2024. Moscow now insists that it can prevail
over the long haul. It certainly does not want its enemy to think
otherwise. Putin likely still thinks that Ukraine will buckle first, but
he has always underestimated Ukraine's resilience and determination.
Perhaps **[a tipping point]{.underline}** [will come when Moscow begins
to recognize the utter futility of this war and the long-term economic
damage]{.underline} to Russia starts to outweigh the costs of
acknowledging that the war's political objective cannot be met. Maybe
some future Ukrainian operation will trigger the necessary reappraisal.

The experience of this war, however, underlines the difficulty of
getting political leaders to acknowledge failure when their forces have
yet to be defeated in the field and when there is no obvious compromise
deal waiting to be negotiated. Neither side has a clear-cut route to
victory. That is what it means to be in a forever war. It is not evident
how it will end, or even if an apparent peace will be no more than an
opportunity for Russia to rebuild its forces under the guise of an
uneasy cease-fire. This will depend on decisions yet to be made.
Ukraine's Western allies, therefore, must be realistic about the
potentially long-term demands entailed in keeping Ukraine in the war.
[**Continuing to deny Russia victory is a form of pressure on Putin**,
who has so little to show for such a long and calamitous
campaign]{.underline}. Although it may be hard to imagine a military
defeat for Russia, it is possible to imagine a shift in Ukraine's favor.
[If Moscow becomes convinced]{.underline}, contrary to its current
expectations, [that time is not on its side]{.underline}, perhaps [that
might]{.underline} yet [cause it to wonder whether the moment has come
to cut its losses.]{.underline}

about higher prices and a grim economic horizon for the sake of a
stalemated, counterproductive, and unnecessary war. [The only thing more

By the spring of 2025, [the conflict had reached a relative
stalemate]{.underline}. The current front line runs over six hundred
miles from the Kherson region in southern Ukraine to the Luhansk region,
part of the Donbas, in the east[. Russia controls]{.underline} roughly
[20 percent]{.underline} of Ukraine [and continues to make incremental
gains]{.underline}. Recent analysis indicates that Russia has
accelerated its territorial advances, capturing an average of 5.5 square
miles per day this month---more than double the rate in April, according
to a Ukrainian war monitoring organization. Reports indicate that Russia
has concentrated almost half of its attacks this year in the area around
Pokrovsk, a logistical and supply hub for Ukraine's military in the
east. Russia also continues to inflict heavy damage on Ukraine's
critical infrastructure and major population centers with long-range
missile and drone strikes. However, [Ukrainian forces have proven
remarkably resilient.]{.underline}

Ukraine Maintains Control Over Most of Its Territory

[Since the]{.underline} February 2022 [invasion, Ukrainian forces have
regained over 50 percent of the territory seized by Russia]{.underline},
notably preventing the capture of Kyiv and forcing the withdrawal of
Russian forces from northern Ukraine during the early stages of the war.
Russia launched a series of new offensives that gained ground in 2024,
but [Ukraine's military managed to slow Russia's rate of advance in
recent months]{.underline}.

Despite Russia and Ukraine's various successes, [neither side has
managed a significant territorial breakthrough in recent
months]{.underline}. As a result, the fighting has devolved into a war
of attrition.

Russia maintains the military advantage it held prior to the invasion in
February 2022, though both militaries have incurred heavy losses over
the course of the war. Around [750,000 Russian soldiers have been killed
or wounded in the war]{.underline} thus far, according to a March 2025
U.S. intelligence report. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a
month earlier that [Ukraine's forces had suffered]{.underline} more than
[425,000 casualties]{.underline} during the conflict. Still, Russia is
estimated to have a total of 1.1 million active-duty soldiers, roughly
600,000 of which are deployed in or near Ukraine. In contrast, Ukraine
has roughly 880,000 active-duty personnel, Zelenskyy said earlier this
year, though other estimates vary.

The high casualty rates have strained both militaries. To an extent,
[the Ukrainian military has been able to adapt its tactics to
accommodate the manpower shortage, using high-tech military
drones]{.underline}, for example, [to slow Russian advances and inflict
high casualties. Ukraine reports having built 2.2 million drones last
year and aims to produce 4.5 million this year]{.underline}. Ukraine is
also building ground-based and sea-based drones, which were used last
summer to drive the Russian Black Sea Fleet out of Crimea and open up
the Black Sea to Ukrainian commerce. In a surprise attack on June 1,
Ukraine's intelligence service conducted a coordinated drone operation
that successfully struck five Russian air bases, destroying roughly
forty military aircraft, according to Zelenskyy. [Drones are now
inflicting]{.underline} an estimated [70 percent of the casualties on
both sides]{.underline}. Russia, for its part, has turned to other
recruitment tactics to boost its manpower, such as relying on foreign
fighters. In November, for example, about ten thousand North Korean
troops deployed to help the Russians counter Ukraine's successful
offensive in the Kursk region of Russia.

#### Ukraine's efforts to recruit foreign soldiers are working

manpower"

//DH

Three and a half years into the war, [Ukraine is pivoting to
international recruitment]{.underline} to tackle its manpower crisis.
The call first went out in February 2022, when President Volodymyr
Zelensky appealed for help after Russia launched its full-scale
invasion. But that initial international legion was badly managed: the
overwhelming majority eventually left because of the chaos and harsh
conditions. Now Ukraine needs to do better. [In May a new recruitment
centre opened]{.underline} at an undisclosed location in western
Ukraine. A digital advertising campaign was launched, concentrating
initially on Latin America.

[The push is promising, with a hundred-odd new applications a
day]{.underline}. Recruits generally pay their own way to Ukraine, and
do not get preferential treatment over Ukrainian soldiers. But the
front-line [salaries of \$3,000 a month]{.underline} before bonuses,
perhaps [ten times the average in poorer parts of South America, are a
**strong incentive**]{.underline}. For some, fighting for freedom is
enough. According to Lieutenant Oleksiy Bezhevets, a defence-ministry
official overseeing the programme, [Ukraine hopes to recruit "several
thousands" more a month from abroad]{.underline}. That would be welcome.
Ukraine's recruitment rate is running at 27,000 a month, roughly 15,000
below Russia's. And that does not take into account a worrying number of
desertions during training.

#### Russia's recruiting advantage isn't sustainable -- it will collapse the economy

//DH

According to figures from Ukraine\'s General Staff, Russia has lost
217,440 troops since Jan. 1, 2025.

The discrepancy tallies with Western analysis of Russia\'s staggering
losses.

\"They lose somewhere in the ballpark of 35,000 to 45,000 people per
month, and perhaps they recruit a little bit north of that number,\"
George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War
(ISW), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.

G[iven that Russia is having to pay people to sign up, the losses have
potentially huge ramifications for the country\'s economy.]{.underline}

According to an analysis by economist Janis Kluge, [Russia\'s daily bill
just for sign-up bonuses is \$24 million]{.underline}.

The [ballooning bills come at a time when Russia\'s economy is already
under huge strain]{.underline} from Western sanctions and falling oil
and gas revenues.

\"The implications for Russia are grave,\" energy security analyst
Wojciech Jakobik wrote in an op-ed for the Kyiv Independent this week.

According to Barros, making any predictions about whether or not the
Russian economy is going to collapse is \"supremely difficult to do,\"
but the signs for the Kremlin \"don\'t bode well.\"

\"[If you look at the current Russian economic indicators, for example
their inflation rate, their overnight lending interest rates, Russian
monetary constraints... government spending is out of
control]{.underline} --- it\'s a very loose fiscal policy and so [the
economy is at risk of overheating]{.underline},\" he said.

\"I [don\'t know to what extent the economy can continue to
last]{.underline}.\"

Ukraine's military relies heavily on support from its Western allies.
The United States has led the majority of the effort to arm and equip
Ukraine, providing them with advanced weapons, intelligence, training,
and billions of dollars of other financial and military assistance.
President Donald Trump temporarily paused U.S. support for Ukraine in
March before resuming it, but [the U.S. aid pipeline is running
dry]{.underline}, and Trump has given no indication that he will support
more U.S. aid for Kyiv. Though the United States has committed more
security assistance than any other country, [Europe]{.underline} as a
whole [accounts for]{.underline} roughly [60 percent of all financial
and military aid to Ukraine]{.underline}. Indeed, with the future of
U.S. assistance to Ukraine uncertain under the Trump administration,
[European countries]{.underline} such as France, Germany, and the United
Kingdom [have stepped up their pledged support]{.underline}. For
example, Germany announced it would provide thirty missiles to use on
Patriot missile systems, while the Netherlands indicated its plans to
supply a Hawkeye air defense system, an early warning mechanism.
However, most experts argue that [the current level of support is only
enough to continue the current stalemate]{.underline}; it is not
sufficient for a Ukrainian victory.

This White House and this [Congress are very unlikely to allocate new
funding for aid to Ukraine, but]{.underline} perhaps others could fill
the gap. [European governments are]{.underline} reportedly [warming to
the idea of purchasing weapons from American manufacturers]{.underline}.
So far, these governments have preferred to buy from their own
companies, but there are a number of systems --- such as the
all-important Patriot air-defense missiles --- that only the US can
provide.

[Ukraine's defense industry is also more self-sufficient than it used to
be]{.underline}. [The drones that are now inflicting the majority of the
casualties on the front lines in Ukraine are increasingly produced
in-country by the country's booming autonomous weapons
industry]{.underline}.

It's even possible that [Ukraine may **benefit**]{.underline} somewhat
[from a more hands-off American approach]{.underline}. For all that the
Biden team made clear it would back Ukraine's war effort for as long as
it takes, Ukrainian officials sometimes bristled under what they saw as
micromanagement from a White House concerned about the risks of conflict
escalation with Russia, particularly when it came to long-range strikes
into Russian territory.

But according to an announcement from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz
this week, [allies including the United States have agreed to lift range
restrictions on weapons headed to Ukraine, allowing the Ukrainians more
freedom to strike targets deep within Russia]{.underline}.

### U - at: appeasement now

#### Trump is mostly just [hot air]{.underline} -- actual [policy]{.underline} towards Ukraine hasn't changed much. Intelligence sharing, sanctions, and weapons will last at [least]{.underline} through 2028

Joshua **Keating,** 20**25** - is a senior correspondent at Vox covering
foreign policy and world news with a focus on the future of
international conflict. "Ukraine hasn't won over Trump. But it might not
need to." Vox, 5/30,

//DH

President Donald [Trump's]{.underline} seemingly infinite [patience
with]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin may]{.underline}, in
fact[, have limits.]{.underline}

"Something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!" Trump
wrote on his Truth Social platform this week, citing the massive recent
airstrikes on Ukrainian cities and Putin's desire to conquer "ALL of
Ukraine, not just a piece of it."

Trump also took a vague shot at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
("everything out of his mouth causes problems"), and one could point out
that Russia has been striking civilian targets in Ukraine and expressing
a desire to snuff out Ukraine's political independence since the very
beginning of the war.

[Trump]{.underline} followed up by telling reporters he [is considering
imposing new sanctions on Russia]{.underline} and posted, "if it weren't
for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to
Russia," but told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he is
holding off on new sanctions for now.

So it's not as if Trump has had a full and sudden change of heart
overnight. But consider that, at the end of February, Trump was publicly
dressing down Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, blaming Ukraine for starting
the war, and halting all US assistance to the Ukrainian war effort. By
that standard, [Trump's new tone is]{.underline} still one of several
developments that add up to [a welcome change of pace for
Kyiv]{.underline}.

Even if there are no new measures taken to either support Ukraine or
punish Russia, and [even if the US "walks away" from efforts to
negotiate a ceasefire]{.underline}, as Vice President JD Vance recently
threatened, [the events]{.underline} since February [still amount to a
remarkable diplomatic change of fortune for Ukraine]{.underline} --- and
probably about as good an outcome as Kyiv could reasonably expect from
this administration.

What hasn't changed: Sanctions, intelligence, and (so far) weapons

For Ukraine, where cities are still reeling from some of the largest
airstrikes since the beginning of the war, and where supplies of
much-needed air defense ammunition are running dangerously low, there's
obviously no cause for celebration. Hanna Shelest, a Kyiv-based defense
analyst with the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Vox that
despite Trump's changing tone on Putin, his ongoing attacks on Zelenskyy
(it's unclear exactly what remarks triggered Trump's ire) indicate that
"we are still in a transactional situation. We have still not been able
to dramatically change the approach of the US president."

Trump, for all his current frustration, clearly still views the conflict
in a way that is much more sympathetic to Russia's interests than Joe
Biden or many members of his own party. But in terms of actual material
support, not much has actually changed since Trump took office.

[He has frequently suggested he'd be willing to lift sanctions on
Russia]{.underline} as part of a ceasefire agreement, **[but he has not
done so]{.underline}**, [and in fact, has signed executive orders
**extending the sanctions** that Biden imposed]{.underline}. Many of
these sanctions could not be lifted without congressional approval. As
Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently put it, "When Vladimir Putin
woke up this morning, he had the same set of sanctions on him that he's
always had since the beginning of this conflict."

[Aside from a week-long pause]{.underline} following the contentious
Oval Office meeting, [US weapons shipments to Ukraine have
**continued**]{.underline}. In fact, [the rate of weapons deliveries
actually **increased**]{.underline} in the early weeks of the Trump
administration because of moves the Biden team made to rush aid out the
door before leaving office.

[The intelligence sharing vital to Ukraine's targeting systems has also
continued]{.underline}, as has --- despite Elon Musk's threats --- the
Ukrainian military's access to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network.

Congress has allocated two types of funding for aid to Ukraine: The
first pays for weapons to be transferred to Ukraine for US military
stocks. That aid has been almost exhausted, experts say. The second
provides funds for Ukraine to buy its own weapons from American
manufacturers. Because of the time it takes for those contracts to be
negotiated and fulfilled, [weapons that were ordered in 2022 are only
being delivered now. The last items from contracts signed in 2024 might
not be delivered until 2028]{.underline}.

The upshot, as Mark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, puts it, is that "[the overall military aid
being delivered is **relatively high**]{.underline} [and will stay there
for **quite a while."**]{.underline}

#### The US still backs Ukraine in [intelligence sharing]{.underline} -- which is the vital internal link to maintaining a stalemate

Narrow Path to Victory Without Trump" Foreign Policy, 6/9,

//DH

But crucially, the [Trump]{.underline} administration **[will not
abandon Ukraine completely.]{.underline}** U.S. policymakers---among
them [a majority of Republicans---realize that there is too much for
Washington to lose]{.underline} from a potential Ukrainian collapse.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates can, and probably [will,
extend offers similar to previous support where it doesn't cost
Washington excessively.]{.underline}

[Washington insiders who deal with the Trump administration on Ukraine
say that **it will not suspend Ukraine's access to the U.S. satellite
intelligence**]{.underline}, [which has been crucial for Ukraine's
battlefield targeting]{.underline}. [This advanced satellite imagery is
**absolutely key** for Ukraine: It is its eyes and ears]{.underline}.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the U.S. National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has lent Ukraine access to a commercial
satellite imagery platform that uses high-resolution radar imagery to
track Russian troop movements, which the Ukrainian military uses to plan
counteroffensives. As the New York Times reported, [the Ukrainian
military depends overwhelmingly on coordinates from U.S.
intelligence]{.underline} for most of its operations involving
long-range strikes.

Critically, [this is one of the few pieces of technology that neither
the Ukrainians nor their European allies can substitute]{.underline}.
Without it, as Ukraine was for about a week in March---when the Trump
administration was roughing up Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky---Kyiv would find itself at an ominous disadvantage. But this
won't happen, because [continued Ukrainian access enables the United
States to have a finger in the war rather than stand on the sidelines as
a useless observer---and]{.underline}, since it's already in place,
[costs very little.]{.underline}

#### Appeasement assumes Trump made concessions to Russia in negotiations on Ukraine. Trump walked away without a deal instead

Scott **Neuman,** 20**25** -- reporter "Trump promised peace in Ukraine
within a day. Here\'s what actually happened" NPR, 6/2,
<https://www.npr.org/2025/06/02/nx-s1-5414522/ukraine-peace-talks-russia-trump-putin-istanbul>
//DH

Meanwhile, [Trump,]{.underline} who has been eager to bring Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to
the table, [has been showing signs of frustration over the process,
suggesting that he is prepared to \"just back away\" and allow the
fighting to continue if the two leaders can\'t make
progress]{.underline} soon.

Seth Jones, president of the defense and security department of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), describes the
U.S. role so far in the negotiations as \"relatively weak\" and cautions
that if the administration were to walk away from the talks \"it would
fundamentally shift the balance of power in the war to the Russian
side.\"

He adds that European nations could not easily or quickly replace the
intelligence that the U.S. has provided.

But Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy at
the RAND research institute, says \"[If \'walking away\' just means that
the president is less engaged and leaves it more to working-level
officials \... then that might not be]{.underline} such [a
calamity,\"]{.underline} but if it means cutting off military assistance
and intelligence support to Kyiv, \"that would be a problem.\"

#### The US will [change its position]{.underline} and support Ukraine because Russia isn't making concessions

//DH

Now, [the war in Ukraine has reached an apparent stasis]{.underline}.
[Russia continues to take small parcels of territory]{.underline} along
the eastern front, [but only by incurring unsustainably high casualties.
The two countries have achieved parity when it comes to their long-range
strike capabilities]{.underline}. Both have become fully mobilized war
nations, allowing Russia to bounce back from its initial failures and
allowing Ukraine, a smaller country, to keep fighting on through
grievous losses. In the immediate future, then, [the frontlines are
likely to remain relatively stagnant. There will be no major
breakthroughs.]{.underline}

U.S. President Donald Trump, however, has promised to end the war,
reaching out to Moscow and setting up negotiations between American and
Russian officials. In theory, these talks could turn 2025 into a
decisive year for conflict. But [there is no reason to think that
interventions by Washington]{.underline}'s new sheriff [will prove
transformative]{.underline}, especially given that Kyiv has been frozen
out of the conversation. The Trump administration is already discovering
that the complexities of this conflict will preclude quick solutions.
[Trump has acceded to]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin's
demand that Ukraine be locked out of NATO]{.underline} and Russia
granted a sphere of influence. [But Putin has given nothing in return,
retaining his maximalist demands about Ukrainian]{.underline}
disarmament and [subjugation. The result could lead Washington to walk
away and resume support for Kyiv]{.underline}.

### U -- at: cooperation thumper

#### Climate data is [unique]{.underline} -- Russia views it as a [bargaining chip]{.underline} to gain concessions

deputy director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. James
Black is assistant director of the Defence and Security research group

Similarly, [[having access to Arctic climate data is important, but not
at any cost]{.underline}]{.mark}.46 [This data is extremely significant
to the wider world as the Arctic plays a special and outsized role in
combating---or accelerating---global climate change]{.underline}.47 This
stems from the essential contribution that Arctic ice, snow and
permafrost make to reflecting solar radiation (the 'albedo effect'),
thus cooling overall planetary temperatures.48 Conversely, when
permafrost melts, it can release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide
and methane into the atmosphere, causing a feedback loop of more
warming, more loss of permafrost, and so on. (Receding permafrost also
releases anthrax and other frozen pathogens into the local
environment.49) Similar runaway climatological effects are associated
with melting Arctic sea ice. This not only causes coastal erosion but
also releases fresh water into the sea, disrupting the halocline and
global ocean currents, in turn making it harder for sea ice to
reform---another vicious cycle.50

[However, [Russia\'s emissions have not declined, nor has it been
forthcoming in providing the necessary information]{.mark} regarding
climatological and environmental issues, even as working group
cooperation has nominally resumed]{.underline}.51 As such, [[Russia
continues to accrue the political and propaganda
benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} of working within the Arctic Council[,
[without delivering]{.underline}]{.mark} on that body\'s stated
collective goals. Furthermore, one could argue that [Russia\'s
withholding of climate data]{.underline}---which is so important for the
climate modelling work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change---should not be a problem for the Arctic Council alone. Russia\'s
actions on this matter [have global consequences; if the climate data is
not shared, it is the global South that stands to suffer the most from
the resultant disruption to scientists\' ability to model---and thus
mitigate---global warming]{.underline}. Should it not then be the
responsibility of the global community to demand this data, rather than
of the Western Arctic countries who already share all their findings and
research?

The situation also begs the question of wider information-sharing.
[Russia continues to share weather data through the World Meteorological
Organization, mainly because it is dependent on that
mechanism]{.underline}. (Aerial operations against Ukraine would be less
efficient and precise, for example, without accurate weather information
for the Russian forces.52) [Climate information,]{.underline} by
contrast, [is of much lesser concern to Russia.]{.underline} And the
broader issue of tackling climate change is far from a priority for the
Russian state and economy. Even in the wake of western sanctions, the
economy remains heavily dependent on exporting oil, gas and
petrochemicals---including from major projects and terminals in the
Russian Arctic.53 [[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[seems to be
specifically withholding climate information to use it as a **bargaining
chip** against other Arctic countries]{.mark}, even as its wider
policies undermine the global effort to combat climate
change]{.underline}.

#### Russia views Arctic cooperation as [weakness]{.underline} and they'll [escalate]{.underline} the war in response

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} experts [[argue that]{.mark} certain areas
of [cooperation with Russia]{.mark}---[such as]{.mark},]{.underline} for
instance, [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region---[[should not be
severed]{.underline}]{.mark} due to their strategic importance. In my
view, however, [this is]{.underline} a [dangerous]{.underline} way of
thinking and a path that must not be followed. [My knowledge of [Russian
history]{.mark}]{.underline} and understanding of the Russian identity
[[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that a policy of
[**[appeasement]{.underline}** [will never change]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the behavior of [Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conversely, [[Russia's
military]{.underline}]{.mark}-political leadership **[[will view]{.mark}
continued [cooperation in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as]{.mark}
a sign of [**weakness** and **hesitation**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
part of the West, [[which is most likely to **result in a larger war**
in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} in the next several years. I firmly
believe that [re-launching cooperation with Russia in the
Arctic]{.underline} with the incumbent political regime [will
be]{.underline} utterly [counterproductive]{.underline}. [Instead, the
process should be]{.underline} incremental and
**[conditional]{.underline}**. To avoid mistakes that the West has
committed after 1991 in dealing with Russia--- which have led to the
emergence of an aggressive and anti-Western Russia---a (partial)
reinitiation of cooperation with the Russian Federation should go
through three major stages.

First, it is necessary to prepare Russia for a constructive dialogue. At
this stage, [[the key goal is to make sure that Russia loses the war in
Ukraine]{.underline} [and its economy is
devastated]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} [This d]{.underline}ual
result [should facilitate the creation of favorable conditions inside
Russia, prompting Russia's political leadership]{.underline} (whoever
might be in power) [to engage in a constructive dialogue]{.underline}
with the West. It is imperative to note that [[this can only be achieved
by military means and economic pressure, and **not by
diplomacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally, the Western alliance
needs to transform its new Northern Flank into an impregnable bastion
and the Russian side should clearly understand that this change is
levelled against Russia for the criminal recklessness of its
military-political regime and multiple violations of international law
both in Ukraine and beyond.

Second, Russia's regime needs to fulfill key conditions. The main goal
of this stage is to create a configuration that could provide a set of
guarantees against the re-emergence of Russia's assertive militarism and
neo-imperial ambitions. In this context, the role of the Arctic region
is critical. [Russia will have to]{.underline} agree on and [fulfill
three crucial conditions]{.underline}:

\(a\) [Demilitarization of Russia's Arctic]{.underline} and High North,
translated into the disabling of existing (para)military infrastructure
and preventing the re-deployment of means of warfare currently present
in the macro-region.

\(b\) [The Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (NSR) [should be]{.underline}
demilitarized and [turned into an international transportation
artery]{.underline}. Ideally, an intergovernmental monitoring agency
consisting of the Arctic nations should be established. Given the
growing importance of the NSR (which is to increase exponentially with
climactic changes) Russia must not be allowed to exert uncontrollable
sway over such a strategic---from a geo-economic point of view---sector
of the Arctic. In case this condition is not met over time, the West
needs to avoid repeating the same mistake in relations to Russia's
commitment to energy security (which was one of the key factors that
prompted Russia to start the war against Ukraine).

\(c\) [Establishing an international monitoring agency]{.underline} that
will be [responsible for tracking Russia\`s compliance]{.underline} with
the main principles of environmental sustainability in the Arctic to
avoid continuing environmental nihilism on the part of Russia in this
macro-region with an extremely brittle ecosystem.

Fulfillment of these three steps should result in emergence of a new,
less one-state centered configuration of international relations in the
Arctic and, most crucially, contribute to the defeat of the ideology of
Russia's exceptionalism in the Arctic region.

[[The Kremlin's foreign policy in the Arctic walks a clumsy tightrope.
It]{.mark}]{.underline} uses international law when convenient, [[courts
China]{.mark} and India as symbolic partners, and flirts with building

its more coherent economic and military Arctic strategies, [its
diplomatic approach is piecemeal and opportunistic]{.underline}---less a
roadmap and more a toolkit for tactical improvisation.

Still[, [it serves a purpose: to keep the door ajar for reintegration

//DH

At the same time, NATO-aligned Arctic states---Canada, Norway, Denmark
(through Greenland), and Iceland---face the dual challenge of
geopolitical marginalization and strategic uncertainty. [[Trump's
previous disregard for NATO]{.underline},]{.mark} coupled with his
preference for bilateralism over institutional frameworks, [[leaves
these countries in a precarious position. If the U.S. pursues]{.mark} a
transactional [partnership with Russia, NATO's role in Arctic security
could be significantly undermined]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For instance, [[Canada and Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}---two pillars of
Arctic defence architecture---[[may find themselves sidelined in major
decisions about Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} resource
[[governance,]{.underline}]{.mark} shipping regulations, and military
posturing. [Denmark, already rattled by Trump's Greenland remarks, could
face a new reality where]{.underline} [its]{.underline} geopolitical
[relevance is diminished]{.underline} not just by U.S. unilateralism but
also [by a Russian move toward alternative Arctic
alliances]{.underline}. [The [existing framework of Arctic cooperation
through the Arctic Council and]{.mark}]{.underline} various
[[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} exercises in the High North [[could suffer
serious erosion]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Moreover, such [a [U.S.-Russia collaboration might **embolden Russia**
to press for revisions of historical agreements]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as the 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty, thereby challenging Norway's
sovereignty over Svalbard. [If Trump tacitly supports such moves in
exchange for strategic gains elsewhere, [it could destabilize the
northern European security environmen]{.mark}t]{.underline}.

[As NATO Arctic states reevaluate their positions, they may seek to
deepen internal EU-Arctic security cooperation]{.underline} or
strengthen trilateral frameworks with like-minded partners such as the
UK or Japan. [However, [without clear support from Washington]{.mark},
[their ability to shape Arctic policy and resist Russian strategic
advances will be considerably weakened]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Conceivably, [[a Trump-Putin axis]{.mark} in the Arctic [could]{.mark}
create a three-tiered polar order: U.S.-Russia as primary actors, China
in a recalibrating secondary role, and NATO Arctic states grappling with
diminished strategic influence]{.underline}. [The resulting
[fragment]{.mark}ation of [Arctic governance]{.mark} would mark a
historic rupture]{.underline} in how the region has been managed for
decades---[replacing cooperative multilateralism with flexible power
alignments and hard-edged competition]{.underline}.

Conclusion

The Arctic is witnessing a new realignment of geopolitical forces.
Donald Trump's return to the White House, coupled with growing
U.S.-Russia engagement, is reshaping the region's geopolitical setting.
What began as diplomatic overtures in Riyadh could now catalyse the
decline of multilateral Arctic governance.

A new bilateral axis between Washington and Moscow may sideline existing
frameworks like the Arctic Council, while elevating resource-driven
partnerships. China, once gaining ground through Arctic investments,
could find its influence constrained. NATO-aligned Arctic states such as
Canada, Norway, and Denmark face growing marginalization, especially as
Trump's approach weakens collective Western leverage.

The result may be a fragmented Arctic order---driven more by great power
bargaining than consensus-building. [Whether this represents a lasting
shift or a temporary realignment, its impact will stretch beyond the
polar circle---reshaping global power equations and testing the depth of
cooperative governance norms]{.underline}.

### IL -- US concessions mean Russia wins

#### Russia's only hope to win over stalemate is to [separate the US]{.underline} from Ukraine [completely]{.underline}. Trump hasn't cut off Ukraine now

[Russia has ways to gain advantage in a long war of attrition. It could
facilitate a U.S. withdrawal]{.underline} from the war, [which would
have a severe effect on Ukrainians' morale, limit the day-to-day
capabilities of the Ukrainian military and send a strong signal globally
that Ukraine was unable to sustain its most important bi-lateral
relationship]{.underline}. Were the United States to opt out, [Russia
could then try to pick off individual European states]{.underline},
pushing them either toward neutrality or toward active support for
Russia in the war. [By driving a wedge between the United States and
Europe, Russia could]{.underline} do more than improve its position in
Ukraine. It could [move closer to its dream of a Russian sphere of
influence in Europe]{.underline} and of a transatlantic alliance in
utter disarray.

[But Russia has mismanaged its diplomacy]{.underline} with the West[. It
squandered the opportunities presented by an avowedly pro-Russian Trump
administration]{.underline} in February, March, and April, [bombing its
way past multiple cease-fires. This has pushed Trump **toward Ukraine
and Europe**]{.underline}, and Moscow has found no way to separate
Europe from Ukraine. Germany's newly elected chancellor, Friedrich Merz,
who has excellent relations with the United Kingdom, France, and Poland,
is staunchly pro-Ukraine, and he has committed Germany to some half a
trillion dollars in defense spending. [Russian diplomacy cannot engineer
a friendly or neutral West]{.underline}, not least because of the way
Russia fights in Ukraine. Putin also prevents Russian diplomats from
exploring the compromises that might save Russia from the wartime
nightmare he has fashioned for his country.

#### Russia isn't making gains and faces mounting losses -- only a complete cutoff of US support will reverse its position

Riley **McCabe**, 20**25** - is an associate fellow for the Warfare,
Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and

//DH

[Russia,]{.underline} by contrast, has [spent the past 17 months
attempting to grind forward in Ukraine]{.underline} with brute force ---
[and according to new data, it has little to show for its
efforts]{.underline}.

[These efforts have yielded fewer than 1,800 square miles of new
territory seized since January 2024]{.underline}, an outcome that
decisively falls short of Moscow's objective to greatly expand its
control of Ukrainian territory. Russian advances in some areas have been
slower than Allied forces during the grueling World War I offensive in
the Somme, a battle which became a byword for costly and futile military
operations.

[For these marginal gains, Russia has paid an extraordinary price in
blood and equipment]{.underline}. Russian fatalities in Ukraine now
exceed the total number of Soviet and Russian soldiers killed in every
war since World War II combined. By this summer, [Russia
will]{.underline} likely [pass 1 million]{.underline} total military
casualties.

[Russia has]{.underline} also [consistently lost 2 to 5 times more
fighting vehicles than Ukraine]{.underline} on the battlefield,
including roughly 1,200 armored fighting vehicles, 3,200 infantry
fighting vehicles and 1,900 tanks since January 2024.

This brutal reality challenges the narrative that Russia is dictating
the terms of the conflict. Yes, Russian forces have been on the
offensive since early 2024 (with a limited number of exceptions). But
initiative alone is not victory. What matters is not just what Russia
has gained, but also what it has lost in exchange.

Russian troops continue to face an extensively fortified front line
consisting of minefields, trenches, anti-armor obstacles and artillery
positions that shred assaults. [Ukraine has also saturated the
battlefield with drones, which now account for the majority of
battlefield deaths]{.underline}. [Ukraine's defense-in-depth
strategy]{.underline}, bolstered by U.S. and European support, has
[transformed the battlefield into a war of attrition that favors
defenders and punishes attackers.]{.underline} Although the Kremlin
appears willing to absorb this punishment in a bid to outlast Kyiv, it
does not seem to be able to do more than slowly attempt to grind
forward.

Indeed, [the Kremlin's path to victory is]{.underline} not through
battlefield brilliance. It is [through Western abandonment]{.underline}.
Without U.S. support, Ukraine could quickly run short of critical
munitions, fighting vehicles, air defenses and precision strike
capabilities, giving Russian forces an advantage on the battlefield.
[The psychological blow of U.S. withdrawal could also shatter Ukrainian
morale]{.underline}, accelerating collapse not through conquest, but
through exhaustion, as happened to Austria-Hungary and the Russian
Empire in World War I.

[Putin is betting that political fatigue in Washington will **deliver
him what his military cannot**.]{.underline} That bet extends to the
negotiating table. Despite Russia's limited gains and mounting losses,
Moscow has shown little interest in serious diplomacy, insisting on
maximalist terms while launching new attacks. But [beneath the bluster
lies a far weaker hand]{.underline} than many in the West assume.

### at: Polar Council link turn

#### The Polar Council assumes Russia gains cooperation support from other BRICS members. But there's [no support]{.underline} for an anti-Western agenda in BRICS

Fyodor **Lukyanov**, 20**24** -- Chair, Council on Foreign and Defense
Policy (Russia) at the Council on Foreign Relations "BRICS as
Diversification of the World Order" 11/7,
https://www.cfr.org/councilofcouncils/global-memos/brics-summit-2024-expanding-alternative
//DH

But this is not the main significance of the summit. The
[BRICS]{.underline} (whose membership has grown from Brazil, Russia,
India, China, and South Africa to also include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran,
and the United Arab Emirates) is an unusual community that does not bear
the hallmarks of a traditional international institution. So far, it [is
a]{.underline} rather [amorphous club with a single unifying principle:
creating a space for interaction that bypasses Western
states]{.underline} and institutions. **[An overtly anti-Western policy
will not prevail in the BRICS]{.underline}**, [as the **overwhelming
majority** of states there are **not interested in aggravating
relations** with the West]{.underline}. But they are eager to have
different options for building political and economic ties, free of U.S.
and EU guidance and mechanisms.

#### Russia lacks the [diplomatic clout]{.underline} to control BRICS

Expanding Alternative" 11/7,
<https://www.cfr.org/councilofcouncils/global-memos/brics-summit-2024-expanding-alternative>
//DH

It [is crucial to distinguish between the BRICS as a collective and
Russia's individual goals.]{.underline} [Decisions within the BRICS are
based on consensus, which]{.underline} often **[moderates]{.underline}**
the positions of [individual members. While Russia pushed for a more
assertive agenda, it faced **scepticism from other
members**]{.underline}, [leading to a more balanced
outcome]{.underline}.

Moreover, [viewing the BRICS through an "anti-Western" lens overlooks
the broader motivations of its Global South constituents]{.underline}.
For many, like South Africa, the [BRICS is not about moving away from
the West but about diversification]{.underline}, especially [in finance
and trade.]{.underline} In the Kazan declaration, the BRICS positioned
itself as a complementary entity to existing institutions like the Group
of Twenty (G20), emphasising greater coordination led by India, Brazil,
and South Africa, which currently hold consecutive G20 presidencies.

#### No impact - BRICS is too diverse to pose a threat to the global order

Order and Institutions Program at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace "BRICS Expansion, the G20, and the Future of World
Order" 10/9,

//DH

[The]{.underline} 2023 [decision by]{.underline} the [BRICS]{.underline}
coalition [to open its doors to five new members has raised anxieties in
the West that global fragmentation is accelerating]{.underline} and
could get worse, especially as another three dozen countries are
purportedly waiting in the wings. [Such fears]{.underline} are
understandable, but they [should not be overblown, in part because BRICS
expansion will only increase the coalition's
heterogeneity---and]{.underline} potential **[cacophony]{.underline}**.
On its face, BRICS+ is a formidable economic bloc, comprising half of
the world's population, 40 percent of its trade, and 40 percent of crude
oil production and exports. The coalition can use this leverage not only
to demand a more equitable international order but also to act on those
ambitions, for instance by establishing a parallel energy trading
system, deepening commercial links among members, creating an
alternative system of development finance, reducing dollar dependence in
foreign exchange transactions, and deepening technology cooperation in
fields from AI to outer space. Expect BRICS+ to seek opportunities in
each area.

At the same time, [the body's increasing diversity may make it even
harder for BRICS+ to formulate, adopt, and pursue unified policy
positions]{.underline}, including within the framework of the G20. To
date, [BRICS has been more effective at signaling what it is
against]{.underline}---namely, continued Western domination of the
architecture of global governance---[than what it stands for. Developing
a coherent, positive agenda for reforming world order and advancing
international cooperation is likely to become even harder as the
coalition adds more countries]{.underline} with very different political
institutions, economic models, cultural systems, and national interests.
The [initial composition of BRICS+ will also complicate its aspirations
to speak for the Global South, further **blunting its impact on global
order**]{.underline}.

#### Other middle powers don't want to end their relationship with the West -- which means they won't turn BRICS against Western institutions

Stewart **Patrick**, 20**24** -- Senior Fellow and Director, Global
Order and Institutions Program at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace "BRICS Expansion, the G20, and the Future of World
Order" 10/9,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/brics-summit-emerging-middle-powers-g7-g20?lang=en>
//DH

These risks are real, but they should be kept in perspective. No doubt,
[BRICS expansion evinces a growing global dissatisfaction]{.underline}
with and a determination to challenge the structural advantages that
advanced market democracies continue to enjoy in a global order that was
in many respects made by the West, for the West. Reducing those
exorbitant privileges, including by creating alternative, parallel
institutions, is the fundamental purpose of BRICS+. And yet
[the]{.underline} very [heterogeneity of the expanding coalition---and
the desire of important middle powers to retain diplomatic flexibility
within the G20 and other multilateral venues---will likely forestall the
emergence of rigid blocs reminiscent of the Cold War.]{.underline}

[Rather than a frontal assault on the existing global
order,]{.underline} [the ultimate impact of BRICS+ is likely to be more
measured and incremental]{.underline}. [It will provide a diverse set of
emerging and middle powers with a vehicle to advance their (sometimes)
overlapping interests,]{.underline} and a platform to tinker---or
"bricoler," as the French would say---with the rules and institutions of
the multilateral system. The United States and its Western partners can
increase the prospects for such a benign scenario by avoiding alarmism
and confrontation, while taking tangible steps to address emerging
powers' legitimate complaints and advance their reasonable aspirations.

#### BRICS doesn't support Moscow's agenda

Yasushi **Kudo,** 20**24** - President, The Genron NPO (Japan) "BRICS
Gaining Momentum" 11/7,
https://www.cfr.org/councilofcouncils/global-memos/brics-summit-2024-expanding-alternative
//DH

There is a tendency to view [the BRICS]{.underline} geopolitical bloc as
a growing counterweight to Western influence. But as this year's [summit
offered no proposals on how to reshape the current order]{.underline},
this does not seem to be the case. Russian President Vladimir Putin has
lauded the fact that the [BRICS]{.underline} has now surpassed the Group
of Seven (G7) in the combined GDP, but in reality, it only [serves as a
means to **conceal Russia's isolation**.]{.underline}

Russia, a nuclear power that is also a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, continues to violate the sovereignty and territory of
another country and has threatened to use its nuclear arsenal. However,
[that does not mean that the BRICS countries are aiming to build a new
order that condones Russia\'s actions]{.underline}.　

While the number of BRICS member states has expanded, so have the
group's objectives. [Even between China and Russia]{.underline}---core
members of the BRICS---**[fractures exist]{.underline}**. A 2023 poll
conducted by the Genron NPO shows that only 27 percent of Chinese
citizens believe that Russia's behavior against Ukraine is appropriate.
Moreover, Russia and North Korea have entered into a military
partnership. Plans are underway for Russia to support North Korea's
nuclear weapon development program, and North Korea has dispatched
soldiers to fight in Ukraine alongside Russian forces. Now that Beijing
is within range of Pyongyang's missiles, it is easy to imagine just how
concerned China might be.

## Impact

### ! -- global war

#### Russian victory will embolden Putin to create a Russian-led global through global wars of conquest

Andrea **Kendall-Taylor and** Michael **Kofman**, 20**25** - \*Senior
Fellow and Director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center
for a New American Security. From 2015 to 2018, she was Deputy National
Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence
Council AND \*\*Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. "Putin's Point of No Return: How an Unchecked
Russia Will Challenge the West" Foreign Affairs, January/February,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/putins-point-no-return //DH

Moscow's actions underscore how, after almost three years since Russia's
full-scale invasion of its neighbor, Putin is now more committed than
ever to the war with Ukraine and his broader confrontation with the
West. Although the conflict is first and foremost an imperial pursuit to
end Ukraine's independence, [Putin's ultimate objectives are to
relitigate the post--Cold War order in Europe, weaken the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and usher in a new
international system that affords Russia]{.underline} the [status and
influence]{.underline} Putin believes it deserves.

These goals are not new. But the war has hardened Putin's resolve and
narrowed his options. There is no turning back: Putin has already
transformed Russia's society, economy, and foreign policy to better
position the Kremlin to take on the West. [Having accepted the mantle of
a rogue regime, Russia is now even less likely to see a need for
constraint.]{.underline}

[The stage is set for the confrontation with Russia to
intensify]{.underline}, despite the incoming Trump administration's
apparent interest in normalizing relations with Moscow. The war is not
going well for Ukraine, in part because the limited assistance the West
has sent to Kyiv does not match the deep stake it claims to have in the
conflict. As a result, [Russia is likely to walk away from the war
emboldened and, once it has reconstituted its military capacity,
**spoiling for another fight** to revise the security order in
Europe.]{.underline} What's more, [the Kremlin will look to **pocket any
concessions** from]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[for ending the current war]{.underline}, such as sanctions relief, [to
strengthen its hand for the next one]{.underline}. Russia is already
preparing the ground through the sabotage and other special operations
it has unleashed across Europe and through its alignment with other
rogue actors, including Iran and North Korea. European countries are
only slightly more prepared to handle the Russian challenge on their own
than they were three years ago. And depending on how the war in Ukraine
ends, the possibility of another war with Russia looms.

The question is not whether Russia will pose a threat to the United
States and its allies but how to assess the magnitude of the danger and
the effort required to contain it. China will remain the United States'
primary competitor. But even with much of its attention called to Asia,
Washington cannot ignore a recalcitrant and revanchist adversary in
Europe, especially not one that will pose a direct military threat to
NATO members.

[The Russian problem is]{.underline} also **[a global
one]{.underline}**. [Putin's willingness to invade a
neighbor]{.underline}, assault democratic societies, and generally
violate accepted norms---[and]{.underline} his seeming ability to **[get
away with it]{.underline}**---[paves the way for others to do the
same.]{.underline}The [Kremlin's provision of military
equipment]{.underline} and know-how [to]{.underline} current and
[aspiring U.S. adversaries will amplify these threats, multiplying the
challenges that Washington will face from China, Iran, North Korea, and
any other country]{.underline} that Russia backs.

#### Negotiated settlement is inevitable -- but if Putin thinks he's winning, he'll start new wars

Fellow at The Washington Institute, focusing on Russia\'s policy toward
the Middle East. "Ending Russia's War: Why Ukraine's Victory Is Crucial"

<https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/ending-russias-war-why-ukraines-victory-crucial>
//DH

[Every war]{.underline} ultimately [ends in a negotiated
settlement]{.underline}. Still, [if Putin goes into the talks with
leverage over Ukraine, the outcome will only lay the foundation for a
**more significant future conflict**]{.underline}. If anyone doubts that
Russia's goals go beyond Ukraine, they only need to recall that [Putin
himself made the war about the West when he said it was the West that
started the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} Further proof comes to light in
what [former Russian president]{.underline} Dmitry [Medvedev described
Russia's goal in Ukraine as "the creation of an open Eurasia from Lisbon
to Vladivostok."]{.underline}

Russia has lost wars in the past. The 1905 war with Japan is a prime
example. This loss, followed by a failed internal revolution, resulted
in crucial reforms. Chief among them, perhaps, is that for the first
time, Russia developed a semblance of a parliament, a nascent step
towards democratization.

Sometimes [only a shattering loss can force internal self-reflection,
leading to a positive change. The only way to push Russia in that
direction is by helping Ukraine win]{.underline}. But [Russia's victory
will shatter American credibility and lead to the war the West sought to
avoid]{.underline}. This year is crucial, and the stakes could not be
higher.

#### Russian adventurism will collapse the international order -- causes world war

//DH

President Vladimir [Putin is more likely than not to invade Ukraine
again in the coming weeks]{.underline}. As someone who helped President
Barack Obama manage the U.S. and international response to Russia's
initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and our effort to keep Moscow from
occupying the whole country into 2015, I am distressingly convinced of
it.

[Why? I see the scale and type of force arrayed by the Russian military,
the ultimatums issued by Puti]{.underline}n and his officials, [the
warlike rhetoric that has until recently saturated Russian airwaves, and
the impatience with talks]{.underline} expressed by his foreign
minister. [Add to that the]{.underline} likely [anxiety produced in
Putin by the demonstrations]{.underline} last week [in Kazakhstan---and
Moscow's success in tamping them down.]{.underline}

But the basic reason I think talks with Russia will fail is that the
United States and its allies have nothing they can immediately offer
Moscow in exchange for a de-escalation.

The United States must do more than issue ultimatums about sanctions and
economic penalties. U.S[. leaders should be marshalling an international
coalition of the willing, readying military forces to deter Putin
and]{.underline}, if necessary, [prepare for war.]{.underline}

[[If Russia prevails]{.mark} again, [we will remain stuck in a
crisis]{.mark} not just over Ukraine but [about the **future of the
global order**]{.mark} far beyond that country's borders.]{.underline}
[[Left unrestrained, Putin will move swiftly, grab some land,
consolidate his gains, and set his sights on the next satellite
state]{.underline}]{.mark} in his long game to restore all the pre-1991
borders: the sphere of geographical influence he deems was unjustly
stripped from Great Russia.

[[The world will watch our response]{.mark}. Any subsequent [acceptance
of Russian gains will spell the]{.mark} beginning of the [end of the
international order. If]{.mark} Europe, [NATO]{.mark}, and its allies in
Asia and elsewhere [fail to defend]{.mark} the foundational United
Nations principles of [sanctity of borders]{.mark}]{.underline} and
state sovereignty, [[no one will. Any appeasement will only beget future
land grabs not only from Putin, but also from China in
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} and elsewhere. And if the world's
democracies lack the political will to stop them, **[[the rules-based
international order will collapse.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The United
Nations will go the way of the League of Nations. [[We will revert to
spheres of global influence, unbridled military and economic
competition, and]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately, [**[world
war]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

### ! -- NATO-Russia war

#### War with NATO is likely if Russia doubts US resolve

Russia Will Challenge the West" Foreign Affairs, January/February,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/putins-point-no-return //DH

[Russia is not in a position to challenge NATO directly]{.underline}.
The current low-scale conflict with NATO countries is likely to persist
until the Russian military rebuilds---a process that could take years.
[But the Kremlin will]{.underline} then [be looking for opportunities to
further undermine NATO. Moscow will still have reason for caution, not
least because it considers the alliance to be a superior force, but it
**may be tempted** if it becomes clear that]{.underline} the
allies---**[the United States]{.underline}** the most important among
them---**[lack the resolve for collective defense]{.underline}**. The
Kremlin would be most prone to make this calculation if the United
States is engaged in a major conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific,
which Washington has deemed its highest national security priority.
Should the Kremlin calculate that Washington would not or could not come
to Europe's defense and that Europe alone would not be capable of
victory, then [Moscow could target a country on NATO's eastern flank,
daring NATO to respond]{.underline}.

[The picture is further complicated by the Kremlin's propensity for both
**risk-taking** and **miscalculation.**]{.underline} Already, [Moscow
has seriously misjudged its ability to rapidly defeat the Ukrainian
military]{.underline} and to shake Western resolve. Personalist
autocrats such as [Putin are the type of leader most inclined to make
mistake]{.underline}s, in part [because they surround themselves
with]{.underline} yes men and [loyalists who tell the leaders what they
want to hear]{.underline}. Washington and its allies should thus not
sleep comfortably even if NATO forces are well equipped to defeat the
Russian military. Having confidence that NATO would prevail in the end
is not enough, especially having observed what Ukraine is experiencing
now: cities destroyed, tens of thousands killed, millions made refugees,
and areas under prolonged Russian occupation. Even if Russia were
defeated today, a future war with Russia could be devastating for the
country it invades and for the NATO alliance. The imperative for the
United States and NATO is to make sure Moscow never tries.

#### That risks extinction

[[Something]{.mark} scary [happened]{.mark} [last
week]{.mark}]{.underline}, [something [that could escalate quickly into
a **world war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A train from Moscow to]{.mark}
the Russian enclave of [Kaliningrad was banned]{.mark} at the border
[by]{.mark} the [Lithuania]{.mark}n authorities because it was carrying
goods which are now sanctioned]{.underline} due to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. An angry Kremlin, claiming that the EU was blockading its
enclave, issued a statement that Moscow would respond in such a way that
"citizens of the Baltic State would feel the pain". Nikolai
[Patrushev,]{.underline} a former KGB spy, [who is now the secretary of
Russia's Security Council]{.underline} and a favourite to succeed
President Vladimir Putin, [said Lithuania's "hostile" actions showed
that Russia could not trust the West]{.underline}, which he said had
broken written agreements over Kaliningrad. Lithuania's Prime Minister
Ingrida Simonyte hit back by saying that there was no blockade as people
and most goods could easily travel as normal. Her country was simply
applying agreed EU sanctions on Russia. She added that it was "ironic"
to hear rhetoric about allegations of violations of international
treaties from a country which has violated possibly every international
treaty. Diplomatic temperatures soared. Moscow's problem is that after
the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991, its enclave of Kaliningrad,
previously called Konigsberg, an area of Germany captured by Soviet
troops during World War II, found itself surrounded by two countries,
Lithuania and Poland, which soon became part of NATO and the European
Union. The enclave of one million Russian citizens could then only be
supplied by air or by sea from St Petersburg. In July 2003, Russia
signed an agreement with Lithuania that allowed its citizens and goods
to travel to Kaliningrad using the train that ran from Moscow through
Belarus and Lithuania. For [ordinary [Russians]{.mark}]{.underline} it
was initially difficult to accept that they needed a transit visa to
travel from one part of Russia to another, and some [[considered it a
national humiliation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless, until 17 June,
when European sanctions started, covering a wide list from coal, metals,
construction materials and advanced technology, likely to affect between
40%-50% of all imports to the enclave, the system worked well without
any problems.

As expected, Russia's foreign ministry summoned Lithuania's charge
d'affairs in Moscow to protest against the "provocative" and "openly
hostile" measures. "If cargo transit between the Kaliningrad region and
the rest of the Russian Federation via Lithuania is not fully restored
in the near future", said Russia's foreign ministry, "then Russia
reserves the right to take any actions to protect its national
interests". It's not yet clear what the actions might be to protect the
interests of Kaliningrad, a key location on the shores of the Baltic
Sea, the base of Russia's Baltic Fleet where [Moscow has already
deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles]{.underline}.

Few expect Russia to immediately attack Lithuania as a result of the ban
on cargo, but the incident has brought attention yet again to another
possible access for Russia to link up with its marooned enclave. This is
a 60-mile-long slither of flat land, squeezed between NATO members
Lithuania and Poland, and Moscow-ally Belarus. Called [[the "Suwalki
Gap]{.underline}]{.mark}", or "Suwalki Corridor", this slip of land has
long given NATO commanders sleepless nights. Should President Putin
decide to invade, Suwalki [[would be perfect for advancing Russian
tanks. If Putin gave the order]{.mark} to sweep across Suwalki, his
[forces]{.mark} [would]{.mark} initially [split the Baltics from the
rest of NATO before the West could do anything about
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} creating a perfect land corridor to
Kaliningrad. [[Such a move would]{.underline},]{.mark} of course,
[[result in]{.mark} an immediate face-off between Moscow and NATO's
nuclear-armed members, pushing the world to]{.underline} the brink of
**[[world-ending confrontation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** No wonder that
[many [analysts call the Suwalki Gap the "**most dangerous place on
earth**".]{.mark}]{.underline}

But [would]{.underline} President [Putin risk such a move?
He's]{.underline} certainly [been preparing for it.]{.underline} In 2017
and 2021, [[joint Belarusian and Russian war games simulated]{.mark} a
conflict under [a scenario in which Russia takes over "a corridor
between Belarus and Kaliningrad]{.mark}]{.underline}". [These were in
addition to the growing number of "snap" Russian war games on NATO's
borders]{.underline}, including live-fire exercises with units at
fighting levels, unannounced and unmonitored by Western observers.
Several have been held right next to the tiny Baltic states of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, NATO's soft underbelly. [[There have been dozens
of violations of NATO's airspace by Russian]{.mark} fighter-[jets and
bombers]{.mark}]{.underline}, often flying with their transponders off,
making them difficult to track. As recently as last Thursday, in a
highly provocative move, [[a Russian helicopter violated Estonian
airspace in an **exercise simulating missile attacks against
NATO**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

### at: Russia military exhaustion

#### Russia will reconstitute its military if it wins in Ukraine

[Russia's military threat is not going away]{.underline}, either. [The
question of Russian military reconstitution is not an if but a when.
Even if Russia cannot sustain its current wartime spending, the defense
budget is likely to remain substantially above prewar
levels]{.underline} for some time to come. The Russian military, too, is
unlikely to shrink back to the relatively small army Russia fielded
before the war. [One lesson that Russia's military brass took from
Ukraine is that the Russian army was not "Soviet" enough in that it
lacked mass and the capacity to replace losse]{.underline}s. In reality,
the Russian military was stuck in a halfway state, having acquired some
advanced or modernized capabilities but also retaining some Soviet-era
characteristics, including conscription and a culture of centralized
command that discouraged initiative. Now[, Russia is likely to maintain
a large overall force with an expanded structure]{.underline} and
greater manpower allocation, although it will still depend on
mobilization in the event of war to reduce the cost of its standing
army.

Reconstitution is about not just materiel but also the capacity to
conduct large-scale combat operations. [The Russian military has shown
that it can learn as an organization; it is capable of scaling the
deployment of new technology such as drones and electronic warfare
systems onto the battlefield, a]{.underline}nd it will be a changed
force after its experience in Ukraine. Despite its initial poor showing,
the Russian military has demonstrated staying power and the ability to
withstand high levels of attrition.

### ! - turns hybrid war

#### Russia uses cooperation as cover for hybrid threats -- the mere intention to cooperate encourages provocation

However successful it has been in the past as a regional platform, [the
Arctic should not be seen as]{.underline} an exemption, let alone as [a
region of peace and cooperation, when the reality is that Russian
actions have long been aimed at leveraging the Arctic as part of hybrid
threats against the West]{.underline}.40 [[Russia is waging a brutal war
of aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} against its neighbour on the European
continent, [[including with troops]{.mark} and equipment drawn [from the
Russian Arctic garrisons]{.mark}]{.underline}. President Vladimir [Putin
has stated publicly that the Arctic 7 countries are]{.underline}
officially labelled as 'unfriendly', meaning that they are seen as
[actors hostile to the Russian state]{.underline}. This must be taken
into consideration with the Arctic Council, despite entrenched hesitancy
to disturb the existing diplomatic status quo.

[[For Russia, Arctic cooperation is]{.mark} of secondary importance,
being more of **[a tool for coercive diplomacy]{.mark}** [and **support
to its hybrid threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}.41 This includes
weaponizing the diplomatic norm that Arctic issues should be resolved
first through the Arctic Council---which explicitly excludes
consideration of military matters---and pressuring other Arctic states
to block the consensus-based NATO from taking a more formal
institutional interest in the region.42

Western countries, on the other hand, are supporting Ukraine in
accordance with the UN Charter and international law. Hundreds of
billions of dollars\' worth of civilian aid and military equipment has
flowed into Ukraine.43 In an unexpected repercussion, in terms of
Russian ambitions in the European Arctic, Finland and Sweden have joined
NATO, driven by fear of Russia\'s unpredictable leadership and its
aspirations as a great power.44 Western cooperation with Russia in other
bodies such as the Barents Euro-Arctic Council has been suspended, with
the other member countries using Russia\'s exclusion as a chance to push
forward with initiatives that Russia might otherwise have blocked or
sought to manipulate and subvert for its own ends.

The continued cooperation within the framework of the Arctic Council is
therefore an anomaly that is difficult to explain or justify. [[By

**Spitsbergen Treaty gave Norway sovereignty over Svalbarg**

[[The Arctic Council]{.mark},]{.underline} established in 1996 to
coordinate peaceful cooperation among Arctic states (A8), now [[stands
at a **critical juncture**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia's 2022 invasion
of Ukraine already suspended much of its work. Now, with Trump's
possible withdrawal from international institutions, the very foundation
of circumpolar cooperation is at risk.

This emerging U[[.S.-Russia rapprochement could **render the Arctic

[[Europe]{.mark},]{.underline} especially Denmark and Norway, **[[risks

the Spitsbergen Treaty or pushes forward on Greenland, it would fragment
existing Arctic legal architecture. Indigenous communities---often

their voices drowned in a race for resources.

Meanwhile, [[climate science and biodiversity

Executive Summary:

- [[Moscow portrays itself as a]{.mark} constructive actor [advocating
  for]{.mark} economic [cooperation in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
  and Baltic seas [[while also conducting an increasing rate of hybrid
  attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} and engaging in provocative discourse.

- [[This double game of cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} has long marked
  the Kremlin's Arctic agenda, but recent months have seen an increase
  in this strategy of engagement and expanded Arctic militarization.

- Russia's dual strategy of confrontation and cooperation in the Arctic
  [[seeks to **exploit divisions among Western
  allies**]{.underline}]{.mark} while portraying their actions as
  provocations, forcing Arctic states to navigate a delicate balance in
  their responses.

[The Russian-hosted International Arctic Forum]{.underline} (IAF) held
on March 26--27 [painted a vision of Russia as a responsible and
constructive Arctic player.]{.underline} The high-profile event included
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} as a speaker and [framed
the Arctic as a region for cooperation]{.underline} between both Arctic
and non-Arctic states. During his speech, Putin claimed that Russia has
"advocated and continues to advocate for equal cooperation in the
region" and that "unfortunately, international cooperation in the
northern latitudes is currently going through difficult times" as "many
Western countries have taken a confrontational course" (Forum Arctica,
March 27). [[This image of Russia seeking cooperation]{.mark} in the
region, however[, is belied by an increasing military buildup in the
Baltic and Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as evidenced by exercises and
provocative language (DIIS, February 14). While this two-pronged
approach is not new, [Russia has been intensifying its Arctic military
operations]{.underline} in recent months, [while continuing to maintain
a rhetorical commitment to peace and cooperation]{.underline} in the
region (see EDM, March 31). Responding to this approach is difficult as
Western states must acknowledge that responding militarily to Russia's
Arctic strategy risks legitimizing Moscow's narratives of Western
aggression and expansion into the Arctic, which in turn could fuel
Russian disinformation that is meant to weaken alliances across the
other Arctic states (Topwar.ru, April 3).

During his speech at the IAF, Putin announced that "the number of
\[Russian\] military personnel \[in the region\] will be increased" in
accordance with the annual federal budget, to strengthen Russia's
military presence in the Arctic (see EDM, October 3, 2024; President of
Russia, March 27). This buildup is part of a pattern of expanded Russian
military presence in the Baltic Sea and Arctic region (High North News,
August 20, 2024). Hybrid attacks are growing more prevalent since
Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including rising hybrid
attacks on undersea cables (European Leadership Network, December 8,
2023; see EDM, February 5). While military exercises in the Barents Sea
are not necessarily increasing in quantity, it is notable that exercises
now include military personnel who have served in Ukraine (The Barents
Observer, March 18). Russia is also upgrading its submarine
capabilities, with Putin recently officiating a ceremony launching the
multi-role Perm nuclear-powered submarine, part of the Project 885/885M
Yasen class (see EDM, March 31). The Perm has a dual hunter-killer role
as well as the ability to vertically launch cruise missiles (President
of Russia, March 27; The Barents Observer, March 28). It is the first
Project 885M submarine to carry Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles, which
reportedly carry a 300-kilogram warhead originally designed to be an
anti-ship missile but has been used against Ukrainian cities in Russia's
war against Ukraine (Kyiv Independent, March 30, 2024).

[Russia's military build-up is reinforced by the narrative that the
U]{.underline}nited States [is an aggressive actor in the
Arctic]{.underline} and that Russia is merely responding to imperialist
behavior. This is evident in Putin's responses to U.S. President Donald
Trump's recent rhetoric regarding the purchase of Greenland (see EDM,
January 21). During his speech at the IAF, Putin claimed that the United
States' plan to "annex" Greenland is part of plans to "systematically
advance its geostrategic, military-political, and economic interests in
the Arctic" (President of Russia, March 27). Beyond the headlines on
Greenland, however, [Russian officials have]{.underline} also
[accused]{.underline} other [Arctic states]{.underline} such as Norway
and Finland [of seeking confrontation with Russia]{.underline}. For
example, one official claimed recently that Norway is seeking to
militarize Svalbard (Aftenposten, December 19, 2024; see EDM, March 20).
Another recent example is Russian presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev's
accusation that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) naval
forces are seeking to block Russia from the Baltic Sea and conducting
cyber operations on Russian ships in the region (Kyiv Independent, March
13).

[In tandem with these accusations, Russia promotes itself as a
cooperative actor in the Arctic]{.underline}. The vast majority of
panels at the IAF described Russia as a central actor for future Arctic
business investment, particularly emphasizing the Northern Sea Route
(Forum Arctica, accessed April 3). The event also highlighted Russia's
efforts to protect the Arctic environment and its humanitarian
cooperation with other states. Beyond the IAF, [[Russian officials have
pushed a narrative of the necessity of U.S.-Russian]{.mark} economic
[cooperation]{.mark} and rapprochement in the Arctic]{.underline}
(Arctic Today, February 27; The Barents Observer, March 12).

[[Russia has the opportunity to use the increasing division between the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its
European Arctic allies]{.mark} on issues such as Greenland [to create
confusion over its intentions]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} and
Baltic regions (see EDM, January 21). [[This presents Moscow with an
excuse to frame any Western responses to its actions in the Arctic as
aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark} (Arctic Today, February 19). [[Such
responses would further justify, in Moscow's eyes, an increased Russian
military presence in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
Poland and the Baltic states said they would recommend withdrawing from
the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty banning anti-personnel
mines, to prepare for Russia's growing military threat in the Baltic
space (Euronews, March 18). Such a policy response will certainly be
framed in Moscow as an aggressive anti-Russia approach that warrants
increased Russian military build-up. On the other hand, [[Moscow uses
engagement by Western actors]{.mark},]{.underline} such as Norway's
virtual participation in the IAF, [[as a calling card that Russia is a
legitimate partner in the region]{.mark}]{.underline} (Forum Arctica,
March 26; The Barents Observer, March 27). [Responding to Russia's
double game of cooperation-confrontation discourse in the Arctic will
come with a cost]{.underline}.

# Track 2 CP

### 1nc -- Track 2 CP

Text: The United States federal government should significantly increase
scientific exploration of permafrost in the Russian Arctic under the
auspices of the High North Talks.

#### The counterplan solves through [private, Track 2 diplomacy]{.underline} -- it avoids the Russia DA and politics

Paul **Dziatkowiec**, 20**24** - founder and facilitator of the High
North Talks, as well as Director of Mediation and Peace Support at the
Geneva Centre for Security Policy "The Geneva Centre for Security Policy
and its High North Talks" 8/8,
<https://www.gcsp.ch/global-insights/geneva-centre-security-policy-and-its-high-north-talks>
//DH

Paul Dziatkowiec (PD): The Arctic region, once a beacon of international
collaboration, is facing a significant breakdown in cooperation
following Russia's attack on Ukraine. This has led to heightened
tensions and an increased risk of military confrontation, a deeply
concerning development given the region's historical significance as a
model of peaceful collaboration.

While I believe there is no need for undue alarm, the current situation
is troubling. [[The lack of trust and dialogue between Russia and the
West]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly increases the potential for
miscalculations and misunderstandings that [[could
escalate]{.underline}]{.mark} into conflict. Given these risks, I would
argue that there is room -- particularly at an unofficial level -- for
maintaining channels for confidential communication to clarify
misunderstandings, understand each other's core interests, and prevent
dangerous incidents.

Initiatives like [[the "High North Talks,"]{.underline}]{.mark} which I
initiated at GCSP in 2022, [[are crucial]{.underline}]{.mark} in this
context. By elaborating guardrails and confidence-building measures,
providing informal communication channels, and injecting creative ideas
into the increasingly toxic official discourse, we can make a small
contribution to maintaining relative stability in the Arctic. My team is
committed to contributing to these efforts to ensure a more secure and
predictable future for this strategically important region.

PJ: Which lines of communications still exist between the two sides?

PD: [[At the official level there is]{.mark}]{.underline} of course the
multilateral system, and [[official diplomacy]{.mark}, with their
various]{.underline} [forums [and]{.mark} opportunities for [direct
interaction at the policymaking level]{.mark}]{.underline}. Embassies
and envoys are important tools in international relations, and naturally
continue as always to have a critical function. So, discussions still
happen -- but these days they have a less constructive flavour, and are
on a much more limited scale.

We have observed that [[since]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's war on
[[Ukraine, there are significant constraints on constructive dialogue at
the official (or 'Track I') level]{.mark}.]{.underline} This dynamic has
spread across multiple forums and diverse issues, in a massive knock-on
effect of Russia's brutal invasion. Sadly but perhaps inevitably, this
affects a wide spectrum of important and urgent international issues and
concerns -- even many such issues where cooperation between Russia and
Western countries was the norm before February 2022, for example in the
Arctic, the Middle East, or Northeast Asia.

On the Arctic more specifically, there are still pockets of practical
cooperation that offer some hope, and can serve as inspiration -- for
example on emergency response or fisheries. As mediators, we are the
last ones who hold on to the positives, and conditioned to seize on
openings -- so I would end the answer by saying that despite everything,
there is something to build on.

PJ: What exactly are the High North Talks?

PD: [[The High North Talks]{.underline}]{.mark} (HNT) [[are an
**unofficial** dialogue platform]{.mark} [that aims]{.mark}, through
constructive and open exchanges, [to foster peaceful collaboration in
the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the turbulent geopolitical climate,
[[our talks provide a **discreet setting** for experts from all Arctic
nations to constructively discuss the future]{.underline}]{.mark} of
this strategically important region.

[[We address]{.mark} a wide range of interconnected issues, from
environmental concerns and [climate change]{.mark} to security,
governance, [and scientific collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
The sheer magnitude of these challenges underscores the Arctic's
significance for the entire world, making the preservation of dialogue
absolutely essential.

Through our talks, [we strive to develop actionable ideas that can
influence decision-making and restore cooperation among Arctic
states,]{.underline} at least on the most urgent issues. By identifying
common interests, developing creative ideas, and leveraging past
successes in collaboration, we hope to prevent the Arctic from becoming
another arena for geopolitical conflict. It is entirely rational to
condemn what Russia is doing in Ukraine, which undermines the most
important tenets of our international system, and to understand the
importance of punishing such behaviour, while also believing that
[[these types of discreet, **private diplomacy** efforts are vital in
fostering understanding and finding ways to deal with urgent
problems.]{.underline}]{.mark} Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to
a more peaceful and cooperative future for the Arctic, which I hope will
eventually lead to the restoration of its status as a model for
international collaboration.

PJ: Why are they different from talks within the Arctic Council?

PD: The Arctic Council, as the leading international forum for Arctic
affairs, is vital for all Arctic states and we all want it to survive
through these challenging times. Its unique structure, allowing for the
participation of Indigenous Peoples' organizations on an equal footing
with states, ensures that the concerns of those most affected by Arctic
developments are considered in intergovernmental discussions. This model
of inclusivity and collaboration offers valuable lessons for other
international bodies.

Our "[[High North Talks"]{.mark} complement the Arctic Council's work by
[provid]{.mark}ing [an **unofficial** platform for open and honest
discussions on sensitive issues]{.mark}]{.underline}, fostering
creativity and robust debate. [[This Track II (unofficial)
format]{.underline}]{.mark}, which follows the Chatham House Rule,
[[allows participants to speak freely **without public
scrutiny**,]{.mark} [promoting constructive dialogue on delicate
topics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The unofficial nature of the High North Talks, which are not bound
by]{.mark} intergovernmental conventions and [diplomatic protocols,
makes it a unique and valuable forum in the challenging multilateral
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It provides a safe and
discreet space for experts to constructively discuss the future of the
Arctic region, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the
challenges and opportunities ahead.

### 2nc -- solvency

#### Track 2 is better at science diplomacy and will [spill up]{.underline} to result in the plan

Sarah **Dorr**, 20**22** - Director of Professional Development at the
International Studies Association and a Research Scholar ar the
University of Connecticut\'s Global Affairs. "How Track 2 Diplomacy
Might Help Ease Russian-Ukraine Tension" 5/13,
<https://jordanrussiacenter.org/blog/how-track-2-diplomacy-might-help-ease-russian-ukraine-tension>
//DH

At a recent academic convention, a Russian colleague shared that he
might no longer be able to place Russian and Ukrainian scholars on the
same panels because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This sentiment
reflects serious concern and sensitivity toward interpersonal
relationships between citizens of these countries. Simultaneously, this
apprehension overlooks the possibility that [[**informal** interactions,
such as academic exchanges, might contribute to relationship-building
and trust]{.mark} between citizens of nations at odds]{.underline} and
that severing those relationships just adds to the existing tension.

As we know, [[many Western universities have ended their academic
relationships with Russia,]{.mark} thereby closing established channels
of communication and engagement. These closures translate into mutual
isolation and an end to dialogue]{.underline}. Delegates, everyday
residents, and the third parties who would have heard the stories they
tell, have lost the opportunity to experience and learn from interaction
with others, who might alter their existing perceptions of a different
nationality in unexpected ways.

[[Against the backdrop of increasing Russian isolation, these
interactions become even more critical]{.mark}. [They create dialogue,
trust, and separate people from the problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
Madeline Albright observed in 2014, "Everyone is a diplomat in their own
way." Therefore, by ending formal cooperation, individual diplomatic
opportunities have already been drastically reduced.

To date, [formal or **[Track 1 Diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, where
diplomats, governments and international organizations formally engage,
has [[failed to prevent]{.mark} the initial [Russian
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} and has thus far struggled to
de-escalate the war. Unfortunately, [[the success of future diplomatic
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least in the short term, [[does not
look likely]{.underline}.]{.mark} On Friday April 29, Russian missiles
struck Kyiv, the day after the United Nations Secretary António Guterres
met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The 29th was the same day of Guterres
visit to Kyiv. This is not a critique of global diplomatic efforts at
large or in this instance, but merely the most recent example of formal
diplomacy's limitations.

[[Academic exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand,
[[are]{.mark}]{.underline} often [categorized within **[Track 2
diplomacy]{.mark}**, [which **does not involve direct government
sanction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some cases, [where formal diplomacy
has initially failed, other diplomatic tracks have fared
better]{.underline}. In essence, [the end goal of relationship-building
is the same, but the means to this end uses a different strategy and is
carried out by different players]{.underline}.

[[One]{.mark} well-known [example of successful Track 2 diplomacy is the
Oslo Accords]{.mark}]{.underline}, signed in 1993. Notably, the signing
of the Oslo Accords, by official government representatives shows that
Track 2 diplomacy only goes so far. In this case [[Track 2 diplomatic
efforts played a major role in the processes leading up to the **signing
of a formal Track 1 agreemen**]{.mark}**t.**]{.underline}

The genesis of Track 2 approaches is often attributed to Herbert Kelman,
who organized a series of workshops starting in the 1970s that
facilitated communication between Israelis and Palestinians. Kelman
described the objective of these workshops as "our emphasis has not been
on communication as an end to itself, but on transmitting what is
learned in the workshop setting to the political leadership, the
political elites, and the general public in the two communities, thus
helping to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations."

"Workshop" fails to capture the highly curated and unique nature of
Kelman's design, which contributed to its success. For starters, the
workshops were held over a period of several years and were highly
structured with both an agenda and rules. Perhaps most important was the
selection of participants. Kelman wrote that participants "must be
politically involved and influential," part of their larger community,
politically moderate, and committed to finding a "negotiated solution."

A present-day adaptation would benefit from similar design
considerations in terms of scheduling, structure, and participants. For
example, workshops with academics and civil society activists could take
place immediately prior to academic conventions, many of which are held
at regular intervals. The convention setting would facilitate discussion
following the conclusion of the workshop by transmitting findings to a
wider audience through international attendance and written outputs.
Academic associations could also act as non politically affiliated
hosts, or what Kelman referred to as a third party.

[Because of the current isolation of Russians across so many sectors,
providing spaces for people to connect in spite of the underlying
conflict has become even more critical to conflict resolution. As Oslo
showed, [unofficial interactions within these spaces can help build and
reinforce relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
in doing so, [[form the foundation for future conflict
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}. And when faced with the sort of
bloodshed seen in Ukraine, why wouldn't all tools be tried?

At the start, at least, Track 2 approaches, whether in academic,
diplomatic or business sectors, will directly encounter discomfort. But
moving through that discomfort perhaps allows for the building of
relationships that humanize conflict impacts and may lead to
de-escalation and conflict resolution.

#### Track 2 solves -- Russian scientists want to participate outside of official channels

//DH

[Russian marine biologist Masha
[Vorontsova]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} founder of the Russia Office
of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, also spoke at the event ,
sharing her personal experience and recent experience traveling to
Russia. She [[emphasized the vital role of Track 2 diplomacy within the
scientific community]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[[We should think of track 2
right when cooperation is not possible at the level of the government,
when there \[are\] no dialogues between the
diplomats]{.underline}]{.mark}. When it was completely impossible to
reach any agreements, we should think about our contacts among civil
society, among scientists, and try to build on these contacts,"
Vorontsova said.

According to Vorontsova, [5,000]{.underline} or so
[scientists]{.underline} who signed a letter against the war in Ukraine
shortly after the full-scale invasion began have [found themselves on an
unofficial blacklist]{.underline}. During her summer 2024 trip to
Russia, she noticed that Russians are constructing "bubbles" in which to
live and function, both at the familial and professional level.
"Scientists are building ... bubbles," Vorontsova said. "I had been to
several institutions. And it was like the 1980s when everybody \[is\]
actively working, because that was the small corner of freedom to be in
your lab in your institution and work."

[She stressed the importance of reaching out to the Russian scientific
community to keep making holes in a new Iron Curtain. "If we\'re
speaking of collaboration]{.underline}, my suggestion is, [look ... to
the scientists inside Russia whom you trust,"]{.underline} Vorontsova
said. "Pick them up, work with them, exchange emails, make Zooms, invite
them to participate in Zooms. [Invite them]{.underline} also [out of
Russia]{.underline}, try to [get them to the conferences]{.underline}."

Pavel Devyatkin of the Institute of the Arctic agreed, but argued that
"[[there is no sweeping ban on cooperation from the side of the
Kremlin."]{.underline}]{.mark} "I agree with what Masha mentioned about
holding on to small bubbles, and how important it is to still work with
Russian scientists and continue to invite Russians to participate in
conferences and projects," Devyatkin said in a comment. "[[There\'s a
whole generation of young Russian scientists who are interested in
Arctic cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Nongovernmental, informal interactions (known as [[Track II diplomacy)
among scientists from Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} (and even non-Arctic)
[[states could be a **powerful strategy for keeping Russia
engaged**]{.mark} and communicating [with the global scientific
community]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The first mechanism to try is for
researchers in neighboring states]{.underline}]{.mark} or territories
[([for example, Alaska,]{.underline}]{.mark} the Russian district of
Chukotka, and Yukon, a Canadian territory) [[to arrange for partnerships
in climate research]{.mark}. Strategically expanding approaches to
scientific cooperation in the polar regions, particularly through
individual contacts, could solidify the Arctic's significance as a focal
point for twenty-first-century science diplomacy]{.underline}.

Second, [the science diplomacy community]{.underline}, housed in
universities and connected through national scientific academies,
[should continue to play a leading role in Arctic science diplomacy by
incentivizing researchers to build new scientific partnerships across
borders.]{.underline} This would require the European Union and NATO
members that discontinued projects with Russian institutions after
Russia invaded Ukraine to take a step forward in reestablishing
collaborations with Russian partners. [Resumed research partnerships
should prioritize studies on the climate risks associated with
permafrost thaw and the mitigation of potential reactivation of ancient
microbiota and dormant pathogens]{.underline}. There should also be a
much more significant focus on cooperation between Arctic states and
Indigenous peoples' organizations, with a research agenda that
intertwines scientific and local knowledge.

And finally, the international community still working within the Arctic
Council platform should prioritize establishing a network of monitoring
stations in the high-latitude Arctic to swiftly identify pathogens in
hot spots of microbial diversity, such as mass bird-nesting sites. Such
monitoring activities can reinforce or create points of contact within
Arctic states and Indigenous peoples' organizations to buttress the
goals of the Arctic Council's 10-year-old One Arctic, One Health
project, which aims to improve coordination and strategies for handling
emerging threats. Improved monitoring and coordination would have
multiple benefits: more opportunities to develop scientific diplomacy,
stronger Arctic health and environmental security, more knowledge about
the global impacts of climate change, and the potential to stimulate new
initiatives to understand other microbial hot spots around the globe.

In one of the last examples of Arctic scientific cooperation with Russia
before its invasion of Ukraine, a study conducted by a team of German,
French, and Russian scholars identified 13 new viruses revived from
ancient permafrost---the result of almost a decade of joint research.
Keeping scientific connections like these alive among Arctic researchers
should be a diplomatic imperative, both to deepen the global
understanding of shared health and climate risks as well as to preserve
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation in the region and beyond.

Even if scepticism is warranted, [dialogue with Russia at an informal,
expert level (Track 2) seems reasonable]{.underline}. [This would make
it possible to test potential approaches to confidence-building measures
and,]{.underline} building on this, [to initiate official talks at a
formal level (Track 1) in due course]{.underline}. [Informal talks are
an instrument that stimulates reflective dialogue between actors in
conflict]{.underline}, [especially when discussions at official levels
are difficult or]{.underline} even [impossible]{.underline}. [In today's
new mistrustful and competitive reality, it is important to restore a
minimum level of stability.]{.underline} Dialogue between military
experts from all eight Arctic states could constitute a new interim
format and initiate a process in which confidence-building measures are
developed.

PJ: Is there a chance of a more specific dialogue again where approaches
like Science diplomacy have failed?

PD: I am not sure this should be characterized as 'failure' but perhaps
a work in progress. These things take time, patience and perseverance. I
still believe that [[science diplomacy represents an important entry
point to dialogue.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[At the state-to-state level, this is **more difficult to do** because
of the need to follow protocols]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} of
course [national positions]{.mark}. Having worked previously as a
diplomat both in multilateral and bilateral settings, I can say that the
[private diplomacy]{.mark} approach often [provides **more flexibility**
and room for innovation --]{.mark}]{.underline} [[which can be immensely
helpful when official dialogue is stuck]{.underline}]{.mark}.

I am proud to lead a Mediation and Peace Support Department that has
connections and skills acquired through decades of experience in both
official diplomacy and 'private diplomacy' and can therefore meld the
best of both worlds, which can be most useful when creative thinking is

#### Russian scientists will censor and falsify data if provided through [official]{.underline} channels

When questioned about paths for continued collaboration with Russia, the
speakers expressed divergent views. [According to one perspective,
[collaboration with Russian scientists was impossible because the data
was subject to extensive censorship and potential
**falsification**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[On the other hand, it was
observed that on a **peer-to-peer** rather than **an institutional
basis,** it was still possible to have meaningful exchange of
research]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as communication. The data, some
pointed out, while important, is also a critical window into retaining
relationships. By addressing the values of science, scientific inquiry
and integrity, some speakers insisted that by allowing politics to taint
the work of the Arctic intellectual community, scientists had failed in
core scientific commitments in spectacular fashion. It was mentioned
that continuous engagement with Russian scientists has always required
bravery and going against the grain, which, at times, results in paying
the price of academic exclusion from western institutions. Most of the
people that still visit Russia and engage scientifically were seasoned
and established academics, whereas the routes for interactions on a
pan-Arctic scale for young researchers are almost non-existent,
presaging a generational gap in relationships and understanding.

International Collaboration in the Arctic

The Arctic research community has long been a beacon and a bastion of
international collaborations. International partnerships with European
and Asian partners greatly advanced our understanding of the role of the
Arctic in the global climate system. Such cooperation promotes more
rapid learning and more efficient achievements.

[Following Russia\'s]{.underline} further [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in February, [[the U.S. ceased
**gov**]{.mark}ernment**[-to-gov]{.mark}**ernment]{.underline} and
multilateral [[engagement with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that was not
in the U.S. national security interest. [[Research]{.mark} that has been
[disrupted]{.mark} [includes]{.mark} [field studies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural carbon emissions, [[permafrost]{.mark}
degradation]{.underline}, large river discharges, and population
dynamics of walrus, polar bears, and waterfowl. Since Russia decided to
escalate this brutal war, [[**Federal** scientists]{.mark} have [ceased
these partnerships]{.mark} and shelved plans for new joint
efforts]{.underline}. [We have had no choice but to forgo the regular
collegial communications that enriched our understanding of Arctic
science since the thawing of the Cold War]{.underline}.

Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has caused tremendous suffering
and a cascade of misery throughout Europe; the disruption of Arctic
science is but one negative outcome that is far outweighed by the loss
of life and threats to democracy. However, we must not ignore the impact
to science, and we remain hopeful that Russia will fully withdraw from
Ukraine and end this war. It was through scientific partnerships and
collaborations that the U.S. and Russia developed a more open working
relationship at various points in history. We remain hopeful that the
scientific friendships we developed in the past can one day pave the way
for mutual respect and cooperation in science and policy. It is for this
reason that I worry about proposals to erect barriers to future
scientific collaboration, such as a policy contained in Section 535 of
H.R. 8256, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2023, which would prohibit OSTP, NASA, and the
National Space Council from collaborating with Russia.

[The magnitude of the challenges associated with climate change in the
Arctic are simply too great for any nation to resolve in
isolation]{.underline}. [We must continue to collaborate]{.underline}
with our international partners, particularly [in field studies and
observations]{.underline}, but also by sharing results, accomplishments,
and understanding.

#### Collaboration between [state-funded]{.underline} scientists is [government-level]{.underline} diplomacy

Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE
University (Moscow) "Can Arctic Cooperation be Restored?" 3/28,
<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/can-arctic-cooperation-restored/>
//DH

[We are witnessing a severing of state-to-state cooperation after
Russia's military actions in Ukraine]{.underline}. Right up
[until]{.underline} February 24, [2022, there was effective interstate
circumpolar cooperation across various institutions and
frameworks]{.underline}. Even just the day before, on February 23, 2022,
Russia's ambassador to Norway read an opening speech written by Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the Kirkenes Conference in the
Norwegian Arctic. The speech mentioned "mutual assistance and
good-neighborly relations" in the Arctic and complimented the Kirkenes
conference as a setting for "constructive and depoliticized discussion
of the pressing issues of international cooperation."1)

From my experience as an American scholar based in Russia during this
volatile period, I believe most [[Russian decision makers would]{.mark}
still [be supportive of Arctic cooperation, but **government-level**
cooperation, such as **collaboration between state funded scientists**,
is]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} than ever.
Some Russian decision makers are wholly pessimistic about the return of
cooperation. Alexey Drobinin, director of the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs' (MFA) policy planning department, said, "The period of
constructive cooperation between Russia and Western countries is gone
for good, regardless of the outcome of Russia's special operation in
Ukraine."2)

After seven of the AC states boycotted Russia's AC chairmanship in
March, Nikolay [Korchunov, Russia's Senior Arctic Official and Arctic
Ambassador]{.underline}, called the pause "regrettable" and warned that
it would pose "risks and challenges to soft security." Korchunov
stressed that Arctic cooperation "should not be subject to the
spill-over effect of any extra-regional events." Korchunov [said, "it is
of utmost importance to safeguard the project activities of the Arctic
Council]{.underline} in order to be able to pick up where we paused [and
**step up cooperation.**"]{.underline}3)

Evidently, [Russia places great importance on its position in the
AC]{.underline}. Russian experts and diplomats have said Russia's
exclusion is counterproductive and irrational. Russian Ambassador to the
United States, Anatoly Antonov, and Minister of Natural Resources,
Alexander Kozlov, have gone as far as calling it illegitimate and
claiming that the boycott violates the principles of consensus given
that Russia is the chair of the AC during this period.4) Russian and
international scientists have also drawn attention to data gaps that
result from cutting off Russian Arctic scientists. Arctic climate
research is crucial since warming in the region is a bellwether for
global climate change. As such statements demonstrate, [Arctic
cooperation with Western states is important to Russia, especially in
regard to its recognition as a great power]{.underline}.

# Topicality

### 1nc -- topicality 'its'

#### Its is exclusive -- it doesn't apply to something [not owned]{.underline} by the United States

**Singh Associates,** 20**17** -- Indian law firm "India: Liability Of
The Promoter With Regards To The Personal Property Given As Security
When The Moratorium Has Been Issued" Mondaq Business Briefing, 9/1,
Nexis Uni, Accessed via University of Michigan //DH

Recently in the case of Schweitzer Systemtek vs. Phoenix ARC Limited3,
the Mumbai bench of the NCLT was asked to adjudicate on the issue that
whether the personal properties of the promoters which have been given
as security to the bank/creditor come under the purview of the
moratorium as envisaged under Section 14 of the Code or not. In this
case, Dhanlaxmi Bank had lent Rs 4.5 crore to the company wherein the
promoter had pledged personal properties. The bank sold the loan along
with security to Phoenix ARC. M/s Schweitzer Systemtek had filed for the
initiation of CIRP under Section 10 (3) which was opposed by Phoenix ARC
fearing that if the case is admitted, a moratorium under Section 14 of
the Code will be issued, which could thwart the action taken so far for
recovery of the outstanding loans which included selling personal
properties of the promoters which were in an advanced stage.

The Tribunal perused the facts and came to the conclusion that the
admitted position of the debtor is that the personal properties have
been given as a \"Security\" to the banks which clearly implies that the
properties are currently not under the ownership of the Corporate
Debtor. In that regard, to ascertain that whether the properties which
are not owned by a Corporate Debtor will come within the ambits of the
Moratorium or not, the Tribunal examined Section 14 (c) of the Code and
observed that the canon of interpretation is a very important tool for
gauging the intention of the legislature and language of the Statute is
such that no word can be added, or substituted or deleted from the
enacted Code, thereby [the term \"its\"]{.underline} in the
aforementioned section becomes very important because on a plain reading
of the section it is understood that on the commencement of the
Insolvency Process, the Moratorium shall be declared for prohibiting any
action to recover or enforce any security interest created by the
Corporate Debtor in respect of its property, the [usage of the word
[\"its\"]{.mark} clearly [makes a distinction between the property owned
by the]{.mark} Corporate [Debtor and **other** properties]{.mark},
[which means that the Moratorium will have **no application on the
properties beyond the ownership** of the]{.mark} Corporate
[Debtor]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this case, since the property in
question was given as security to the bank, the moratorium would not
apply on the personal properties.

#### The plan violates -- it's not exclusive to the USFG because it fiats cooperation with Russia and works through the Arctic Council

#### That's a voting issue -- it unlimits the topic, cooperation could occur with [any]{.underline} country globally, it expands aff advantage ground in unpredictable ways
