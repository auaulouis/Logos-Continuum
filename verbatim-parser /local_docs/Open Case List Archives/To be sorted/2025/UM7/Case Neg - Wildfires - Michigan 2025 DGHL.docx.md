Key Points

- [[Between 1978 and 2023, permafrost temperatures increased at 14 of
  the 15 borehole]{.mark} sites]{.underline} shown in this indicator
  (see Figures 1 and 2). [[Warming was statistically significant at all
  14]{.mark} of the boreholes that had increases.]{.underline}

- In general, [permafrost has warmed more quickly in northern Alaska
  than interior Alaska]{.underline} (see Figure 2). The increasing rate
  of change in the north is consistent with changes in air temperatures,
  which have increased more quickly in northern Alaska than in other
  parts of the state4 (see Figure 3 of EPA's U.S. and Global Temperature
  indicator).

- The Deadhorse site in northern Alaska had the highest rate of
  temperature change, at +1.5°F per decade. The Livengood site in
  interior Alaska was the only site to get cooler over the period of
  record, though only slightly. Overall, permafrost temperatures have
  increased at an average rate of 0.6°F per decade.

- [Changes in permafrost temperature shown in this indicator are
  consistent with changes observed in Russia, Canada, and other parts of
  the Arctic.1]{.underline}

Background

Permafrost is defined as rock or soil that remains at or below the
freezing point of 32°F for two or more years. Permafrost usually lies
below an "active layer" of ground that freezes and thaws every year with
seasonal changes in temperature.1 Permafrost occurs in many different
forms with various amounts of ice (continuous and discontinuous) and is
mainly found in areas near the Arctic. In Alaska, about 80 percent of
the ground has permafrost underneath it.2 A key characteristic affecting
the state of permafrost is the temperature at the ground surface and
shallow depths. The seasonal timing, amount, and extent of snow cover
(see the Snow Cover indicator) also affect permafrost.3 [A [warming
climate]{.mark} has [brought **higher temperatures** to]{.mark} Alaska
and other [areas with permafrost, causing]{.mark} some
[permafrost]{.mark} to [thaw]{.mark}. While the impacts of climate
change on permafrost vary at regional and local scales, permafrost
thawing has been observed in many locations around the
world.]{.underline}

A thawing permafrost layer can lead to severe impacts on people and the
environment. For instance, as ice-filled permafrost thaws, it can turn
into a muddy slurry that cannot support the weight of the soil and
vegetation above it. Infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and pipes
could be damaged as permafrost thaws.4 Infrastructure damage and
erosion, due in part to permafrost thaw, has already caused some
communities in western and southern Alaska to have to relocate.
Additionally, organic matter (like the remains of plants) currently
frozen in the permafrost will start to decompose when the ground thaws,
resulting in the emission of methane and carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere. This contributes to further global climate change.1

About the Indicator

[[For]{.mark} more than [40 years, a group of scientists]{.mark} from
the University of Alaska Fairbanks has been studying permafrost across
Alaska. They [measure temperature]{.mark} every year [in 15
boreholes]{.mark} drilled at least 50 feet deep and analyze the data for
long-term trends. [This data]{.mark} set [provides valuable information
about how **rapid climate changes**]{.mark} observed in Alaska are
**[influenc]{.mark}ing** [permafrost]{.mark}. Because permafrost
temperatures can also be influenced by land use change such as urban
development, agriculture, and other human activities, [this indicator
focuses on]{.mark} a select set of [boreholes that are]{.mark}
relatively [**remote** and undisturbed for better assessment of changes
associated with climate]{.mark}. Figure 1 shows temperature measurements
for each borehole site in the interior and northern Alaska regions.
Figure 2 shows the long-term rate of permafrost temperature change per
decade, for all boreholes.]{.underline}

About the Data

Indicator Notes

Some borehole sites used in this indicator rely on data collected at
depths less than 65 feet, which may be influenced by seasonal or
short-term surface temperature change. Additionally, some sites were not
measured every year, creating gaps of two to four years, but all the
sites included in this indicator meet minimum data completeness required
for long-term change calculation. Logistical issues caused minor
fluctuation in the exact timing of when measurements were collected each
year, which could also add some uncertainty to the results.

This collection of sites is not necessarily representative of all types
of permafrost or all temperature trends throughout Alaska. Permafrost
temperature can vary depending on local environmental factors such as
soil type, vegetation characteristics, and snow cover depth. Notably,
permafrost in northern Alaska is naturally colder and more continuous
than permafrost in the interior region.

### 2NC -- Alt Causes

#### Alt causes\-\--societal emissions and feedback loops enrages permafrost melt.

**Salata Institute 24** \[Salata Institute, develops and advances
durable, effective, and equitable solutions to the climate change
challenges confronting humanity. A central pillar of this mission is
reducing greenhouse gas emissions to global net zero in a sustainable
manner. The Salata Institute seeks support from organizations and
individuals who share this vision.; "Thawing permafrost: what does it
mean? And what can be done?" The Salata Institute for Climate and
Sustainability at Harvard University, 6/11/24;
https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/thawing-permafrost-what-does-it-mean-and-what-can-be-done/\]

[One of the biggest remaining unknowns in modeling the effects of
climate change is the impact of thawing permafrost in the Arctic region,
which could unleash large quantities of climate-warming
methane]{.underline}. While this has been known for decades, there is so
much uncertainty about the details that present climate models do not
include this effect -- and thus could be seriously underestimating the
rate of global warming, and the intensity of measures needed to control
it.

Experts spoke about this issue in a June 11 Harvard Climate Action Week
panel moderated by Henry Lee, the Jassim M. Jaidah Family Director of
the Environment and Natural Resources Program with the Belfer Center at
Harvard Kennedy School. To open the discussion, Lee asked the panel "Why
should anyone living in the temperate areas in our planet worry about
permafrost thaw in the Arctic?"

\[\[IMAGES OMITTED\]\]

John Holdren, former co-director of the Office of Science and Technology
Policy in the Obama administration and now a research professor at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, answered that "[one
reason is that it is the emissions from **society's activities** in the
temperate regions, above all, that are **driving** global climate
change. And global climate change is happening **three to four times
faster** in the Arctic than in the world on average. And if the world
doesn't slow down its emissions at a greater rate that is happening
today, all that is going to get **worse**]{.underline}."

What's more, Holdren added, "[there are **feedbacks** from it getting
worse faster in the Arctic, which in turn will accelerate climate change
worldwide]{.underline}." The feedbacks have to do with vast amounts --
the exact extent of which are unknown -- of methane gas that is frozen
into the Arctic permafrost. [As the global climate warms up, this
permafrost thaws and releases, in addition to carbon dioxide, methane, a
potent if short-lived greenhouse gas. This causes even more warming,
thus thawing more permafrost and releasing even more methane, and so
on.]{.underline}

Sue Natali, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center
and lead researcher on the Permafrost Pathways project, a collaboration
between Woodwell Climate Research Center and the Belfer Center's Arctic
Initiative, said "I would suggest not to just worry about it, but
potentially think about doing something about it," as there are
potentially actions that could help to slow this effect, she said.
"Regardless of where you are, you have the power to work with your
decision makers to try to do something to stop permafrost thaw... Even
though it may seem too far away, it actually is not that far away. It's
very much a part of your life wherever you are."

The Permafrost Pathways project she runs, she said, is aimed at
gathering detailed data that still does not exist about exactly how much
methane is being released and where, and how it might be controlled.
"[One main problem is that we don't even really have a good sense of
greenhouse gas emissions from the permafrost region."]{.underline}

["We don't really have a very good sense of what \[these emissions\]
will be in the future,"]{.underline} added Natali. "[We know that we're
not accounting for these potential emissions in our policy, both in
terms of our mitigation policy as well as in our policies to adapt to
climate change. And so, what we're doing in the project is to greatly
ramp up our monitoring on the ground."]{.underline}

[But that's no small task. Half of the Arctic region lies in Russia, and
has a significantly different ecosystem than that of the Alaskan and
Canadian Arctic. Yet, because of tensions from the Ukraine invasion, at
present there is **no cooperation** that could lead to the needed
installation of monitoring stations there, of which five had originally
been planned.]{.underline} "We have 10 partners in Alaska, as well as
working with other indigenous Alaska native communities, on what are the
impacts that people are seeing now, and how are people responding to
it," said Natali.

### 1NC -- Canada thumps smoke

#### Smoke from Canadian wildfires is [pouring]{.underline} into Alaska.

**Gewecke & Forrester 25** \[Kenton Gewecke, broadcast meteorologist
with more than 7 years of on air experience; Megan Forrester,
journalist, Master's in Journalism @ Northwestern University,

"Canadian wildfire smoke poses threat to several US states. [There are
**181 active wildfires in Canada**]{.underline} as of Monday, officials
said.," ABC News, 6/2/25;
https://abcnews.go.com/US/canadian-wildfire-smoke-poses-threat-us-states/story?id=122415109\]

[Smoke poured over the Canadian border into eastern Alaska this weekend,
bringing poor air quality to communities from Southeast to the
Interior.]{.underline}

[The smoke is from wildfires in Canada including the Summit Lake Fire,
which is burning hundreds of miles away in British Columbia. That fire
started in late May, and firefighters have said it\'s still **out of
control**.]{.underline}

A[round Fairbanks, people are dealing with an uncomfortable combination
of **hot weather** and **poor air quality**. Jason Laney, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fairbanks, said the
Interior communities of Delta Junction and Tok will see the worst of
smoke over the next week.]{.underline}

Laney urges people in those areas --- especially the elderly, children,
and people with certain health conditions --- to stay indoors as much as
possible.

"The best thing any of us can do if you\'re really susceptible to the
bad air quality is try to stay indoors and try not to bring outdoor air
into the home," he said.

[That last part can be difficult for some. The Interior is also under a
heat advisory, and very few homes in the region have air
conditioning.]{.underline}

Smoke also blanketed the Upper Lynn Canal in Southeast. Data from the
Skagway Traditional Council's air quality monitoring program showed
dangerous levels for some groups on Monday afternoon.

["Skagway got up to an AQI over 100," said Reuben Cash, the Skagway
Traditional Council's environmental program coordinator. "So folks who
might have asthma or cardiovascular issues are going to be not just
feeling ailments, but it\'s going to be unhealthy for
them."]{.underline}

On Monday, levels were even higher -- the Air Quality Index approached
150. Above that threshold, it's unhealthy for the general population to
be outside. Cash said conditions improved both Sunday and Monday as the
wind picked up and cleared out the area.

[Data from air quality sensors in the Chilkat Valley showed levels were
also elevated in Klukwan and Haines both Monday afternoon and over the
weekend. Cash and meteorologists from the National Weather Service said
rain and wind could help clear smoke out, but they expect it will take
some time for the smoke to dissipate.]{.underline}

Paula Walbauer, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Fire Service,
said she expects to see similar fire conditions going forward.

"Tourists and people local to the area should anticipate that [we'll see
these fires **all summer long**]{.underline}," she said.

### 2NC -- Black carbon alt cause

#### [Black carbon]{.underline} from [wildfire smoke]{.underline} is an [alt cause]{.underline}. Also, other factors still contribute to high emissions.

**Clarity 25** \[Clarity, company focused on providing air quality
monitoring solutions; "Black carbon's effect on Arctic ice melt,"
Clarity 3/3/25;
https://www.clarity.io/blog/black-carbons-effect-on-arctic-ice-melt\]

Black carbon\'s effect on Arctic ice

[Black carbon significantly influences Arctic climate dynamics. When
black carbon settles on snow and ice, it **reduces** their
albedo---essentially their ability to reflect sunlight. This reduction
in albedo means less sunlight is reflected, and **more solar radiation**
is **absorbed**. Consequently, these ice masses melt at an **accelerated
rate.**]{.underline}

This process has profound implications. As ice melts, the Arctic\'s
ability to regulate global climate patterns diminishes. The exposed
ocean absorbs more heat, further warming the region. This warming not
only affects local ecosystems but also has cascading effects on global
weather patterns

[Reduced ice cover in the Arctic does open potential new shipping
routes]{.underline}. These routes could reshape global trade, offering
shorter paths between major markets. However, the environmental cost of
such developments must be considered. The increase in shipping traffic
could exacerbate air pollution, compounding the effects of climate
change

Efforts to mitigate these impacts require precise measurement of black
carbon emissions.

Sources and global impact

Black carbon emissions stem from diverse sources, each contributing
significantly to its global impact.

[Major sources]{.underline}: Diesel engines, [biomass
burning]{.underline}, and residential heating are primary contributors.
[These activities release potent pollutants into the atmosphere.
Developing countries account for over 75% of these emissions, primarily
due to]{.underline} widespread use of cookstoves and [solid fuels
like]{.underline} coal and [wood.]{.underline}

#### Tariffs [destroyed]{.underline} US-Canada relations.

**Saltman 25** \[Max Saltman; "Old US-Canada relationship is 'over,'
warns Canadian prime minister," CNN, 3/28/25;
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/americas/canada-trump-tariffs-response-latam-intl\]

(CNN) **---** [Canada will have to "**dramatically reduce**" its
reliance on the United States as the two countries' relationship
darkens,]{.underline} Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warned on
Thursday, adding that [the old bilateral relationship was
"**over**."]{.underline}

After holding a cabinet meeting to discuss Canada's response to US
President Donald Trump's tariffs threats[, Carney told reporters in
Ottawa that he foresaw the coming of a "**fundamentally different
relationship**" between the two countries.]{.underline}

"[The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening
integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation
is over," he said.]{.underline}

["It's clear the US is **no longer** a **reliable**
partner]{.underline}. It is possible that with comprehensive
negotiations, we could reestablish an element of confidence but there
will be no going backwards," [the Canadian leader said, adding that
future governments would have to grapple with the same changed
dynamic.]{.underline}

"There's even more to do, and that's why I chose to go to France and the
United Kingdom, two long-standing and reliable partners, friends and
allies of Canada," Carney said, referring to his first international
trip as prime minister.

Hours before Carney spoke, Trump wrote on his Truth Social social media
platform that Canada and the European Union would face "large scale
Tariffs, far larger than currently planned," if they work together to
"do economic harm" to the US.

In Ottawa, [Carney said that tariffs imposed by Washington]{.underline},
if permanent, [would require "a broad renegotiation of our security and
trade relationship with the United States."]{.underline}

["We will need to **dramatically reduce our reliance** on the United
States,"]{.underline} Carney continued. "We will need to pivot our trade
relationships elsewhere, and we will need to do things previously
thought impossible at speeds we haven't seen in generations."

Trump and Carney are expected to speak by phone in the coming days, he
also said, noting that the White House had reached out regarding a call
on Wednesday night. Though he has no plans to visit Washington, Carney
-- who became prime minister less than two weeks ago -- said it is
"possible" members of his cabinet may make the trip.

Canada 'will respond forcefully'

[Carney's latest comments follow Trump's declaration on Wednesday of a
25% tariff on all cars and car parts shipped to the US. The move drew
global criticism; Carney deemed it a "**direct attack**" that
**violated** the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.]{.underline}

Carney on Thursday promised a strategy of "retaliatory trade actions" to
be unveiled after Trump makes an expected announcement on April 2
regarding the US's next steps.

"This is a negotiation," Carney said, declining to go into specifics.
"It doesn't make sense to tip your hand and say what you're going to do
going forward."

The prime minister noted that his government understands the US tariffs
strategy to be focused on five key sectors --- the automotive industry,
lumber, steel and aluminum, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.

"We have a number of measures that we can take in response to those
initiatives," Carney continued, adding that it "doesn't make sense" to
respond individually to each measure from the US.

"We're going to know a lot more in a week and we will respond then," he
said.

Carney's wait-and-see approach aligns with that of Mexican President
Claudia Sheinbaum, who told reporters on Thursday morning that Mexico
would also announce its own tariff plans after April 2.

"[We will respond forcefully]{.underline}. Nothing is off the table to
defend our workers and our country," Carney said, warning Canadians that
"[there is **no silver bullet**, there is **no quick fix**]{.underline}"
in a trade war.

["I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us
so that America can own us,"]{.underline} Carney also said.

After a century and a half of building an economic and military
partnership that survived two world wars, the Great Depression, the Cold
War and the 9/11 attacks, [the United States and Canada are **breaking
up.**]{.underline}

So said Prime Minister Mark Carney in a national television address to
41 million Canadian citizens from Parliament Hill last week. And it is
almost all because of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

["The old relationship we had with the United States, based on deepening
integration of our economies and tight security and military
cooperation, is over," Carney declared on March 27. "We must
fundamentally reimagine our economy. We will need to ensure that Canada
can succeed in a drastically different world."]{.underline}

The striking messaging, some of which Carney's Conservative opponent
Pierre Poilievre has also begun to adopt, underlines the degree to which
anger at the U.S. has taken over the current Canadian federal election
campaign[. In the wake of **repeated threats** from Trump to make Canada
the "**51st state**," followed by the wholesale **implosion** of the
countries' economic ties, there seems to be **very little appetite**
among voters for gentle reassurance.]{.underline}

[Carney deliberately repeated the "O" word again several times on
Thursday as he gave Canada's response to Trump's so-called Liberation
Day tariff announcement from the previous afternoon. That included 25
percent counter tariffs on U.S. auto imports to Canada to counter
Trump's imposition of levies on Canadian automobiles, steel and aluminum
to punish what Trump sees as a lack of progress in stopping a minuscule
amount of fentanyl from illegally crossing America's northern
border.]{.underline}

The auto industry was the cornerstone of modern Canada-U.S. cooperation,
dating back to 1965 --- the year Carney was born --- when they signed
the Auto Pact. It created tariff-free automobile trade and helped
establish the industry in Ontario, Canada's most populous province.

Carney said the pact marked the beginning of a "[60-year period of close
cooperation, partnership, job growth and prosperity. **That era has now
ended**]{.underline}, unless the United States and Canada can agree on a
new comprehensive approach."

[Some U.S. politicians echoed Carney's words. "\[Trump\] **ended** the
several hundred year friendship between the US and Canada --- our
neighbor and closest ally," Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on X last
week.]{.underline}

"The tariffs on Canada are going to hurt my state. It's going to hurt
our neighbors there," said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).

Trump's tariffs would also cause broader harm, Carney said, predicting a
"rupture" of the global economy, ending an era of U.S. dominance dating
back to World War II.

global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and

### 1NC -- AT: Melting

#### Permafrost melting is inevitable. It's on course to disaster no matter what.

**WWF, 25** (The World Wide Fund for Nature is a Swiss-based
international non-governmental organization founded in 1961 that works
in the field of wilderness preservation and the reduction of human
impact on the environment, 5/28/2025,
https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/features/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-crisis-as-ice-melts-and-risks-rise//
BK)

What are the primary drivers for the Arctic's accelerated warmth,
especially compared to the rest of the world?

The Arctic acts like Earth's climate refrigerator. Warm air and water
from the south are carried there by ocean currents and weather systems
and are cooled down by the cold ocean and (shallow) atmosphere. But as
global warming intensifies, more heat reaches the Arctic, causing ice
and snow to melt. **[This weakens the Arctic's cooling effect, allowing
heat to build up and making the region warm even faster. This process is
called Arctic amplification.]{.underline}**

Previously, [the **[Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[was [reported to
be]{.mark} warming twice as fast as the global average. Later, research
showed it was [warming three times faster]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And
data from the 40 years leading up to 2022, based on the region north of
66°N (the Arctic Circle rather than the broader 60°N definition used in
atmospheric sciences), suggests it may be nearly four times faster.

Why does Arctic warming matter for the rest of the world?

We should be beyond the point of chasing new Arctic climate
records---this isn't a competition. People know the climate crisis is
here, even if some avoid taking action. The frozen Arctic is
disappearing because of mankind's insatiable appetite for burning fossil
fuels. Losing it has global consequences---what happens in the Arctic
doesn't stay in the Arctic.

But the consequences are also Arctic---as a melting Arctic means losing
its unique wildlife, ecosystems, landscapes, and Indigenous cultures.

More critically, we are losing the cryosphere---the frozen world of
snow, sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, and permafrost. This frozen world
helps regulate the climate and keep sea levels stable. Without it, the
entire planet is at risk.

How does this impact the rest of the world?

The **[[loss of Arctic sea]{.mark} [ice has been]{.mark} dramatic, with
[a decline of about 60 per cent]{.mark} since 1900]{.underline}**, most
of which has happened since 1980. With less ice to reflect sunlight,
more heat is absorbed by the ocean, contributing to changes in
atmospheric and oceanic patterns. These shifts have been widely
discussed in relation to extreme weather events in the Northern
Hemisphere.

Thawing permafrost releases additional greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere, estimated to add the emissions of a medium sized country to
the atmosphere over the course of this century. Once this process
begins, it will continue for hundreds of years, leaving future
generations to deal with its effects.

One of the biggest concerns is **[the Greenland Ice Sheet, which is
considered a major global tipping point.]{.underline}** Scientists
estimate that its threshold for slow but inevitable disintegration lies
somewhere between 1.5 and 2.2 degrees of global warming. **[With current
commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, we are on track for 2.3 degrees
of warming by 2100. This would be sufficient to melt large parts of
Greenland and West Antarctica, leading to sea-level rise exceeding 10
metres in the coming centuries]{.underline}**. The speed and magnitude
of this long-term, **[unstoppable sea-level rise]{.underline}** will
cause persistent challenges for coastal regions including widespread
loss of agricultural land, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Today, about
75 per cent of cities with more than five million inhabitants are
located below 10 metres in elevation, making this a crisis that will
affect millions

What changes are happening in the Arctic due to warming?

The Arctic is transforming before our eyes. People living in the region
no longer recognize the seasons, the wildlife they bring, or what
activities are safe to carry out. Life is out of sync, making Indigenous
cultures increasingly vulnerable. Traditional travel and transport on
snow and ice have become unreliable and even unsafe, threatening food
security for those who rely on country foods.

Permafrost coasts are eroding, forcing entire communities to relocate.
Thawing permafrost is also destabilizing slopes, causing landslides and
altering river ecosystems. In the Arctic Ocean, fish communities are
shifting as southern species move north, squeezing Arctic species into
ever-smaller spaces where they face local extinction. On land, similar
changes are happening altering entire landscapes, as vegetation and
animal populations are pushed toward the Arctic coastline, with nowhere
left to go.

ow can we slow or stop Arctic warming?

**[[The only solution is to stop burning fossil fuels]{.mark}. To keep
the global temperature overshoot beyond 1.5 degrees to a minimum, [we
must cut emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by
2050.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[This is a Herculean
effort]{.underline}**]{.mark} that requires absolute focus and
determination. The fate of the Arctic---and with it, much of humanity's
well-being---rests in the hands of those making decisions to reduce and
stop the burning of fossil fuels. **[[There are no quick fixes or
alternatives]{.mark}. It is still possible to change course, but action
must happen now.]{.underline}**

**[[At the moment, there is no clear leadership, and climate
negotiations remain deadlocked]{.mark}. But we cannot negotiate with the
melting point of ice.]{.underline}**

THE ISSUE Temperatures have been increasing faster in the Arctic than
elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, outpacing current climate model
predictions. Climate change in the Arctic may increase zoonotic disease
risks due to expansion of vector habitats, development of climatic
conditions favourable to vectors and hosts that normally do not reside
in the Arctic, changes in human-animal associations and permafrost
degradation (1,2). [Climate factors can directly and indirectly impact
disease transmission by changing human behaviors, vector ecology, or
pathogen survival]{.underline} (3). [**Significant numbers of viable
microorganisms are known to be present within the permafrost**, include
those recovered from permafrost dating back millions of
years]{.underline} (4). Evidence supports the hypothesis that pathogens
also are preserved in glaciers, ice sheets, and lake ice (5). Permafrost
and ice are thawing at higher latitudes and to greater depths than ever
recorded. [As the permafrost and ice thaw, buried carcasses of infected
animals and people have been exposed and ensuing flooding and soil
disruption are creating plausible avenues for pathogen
dispersal]{.underline}. Degradation of existing sanitary infrastructure
could amplify these avenues for transmission. [The revival of 4 viruses
of amoeba from permafrost over 30,000 years old (6,7) plus outbreaks of
anthrax in Siberia (8) are fueling concerns that melting permafrost and
Arctic ice may be a source of re-emerging known pathogens and/or the
revival of ancient yet unknown pathogen]{.underline}s. Permafrost has
been considered an impermeable barrier to the movement of contaminants
from burial sites but as it melts organic matter in the soil become
available for remobilization and introduction into aquatic systems (9).

The public health significance of these findings is unknown but can be
questioned. [The revived virus affecting amoeba **are not human
pathogens** and have evolved to live in colder conditions than the human
body]{.underline}. Anthrax outbreaks have been a constant feature of the
Canadian Arctic, well-before this accelerated rate of permafrost melt.
[**Arctic populations are relatively small and widely dispersed**, a
factor that might delay transmission of a pathogen exposed by ice or
permafrost melting]{.underline}. Studies of ancient pathogens in frozen
environments are sparse in the literature. Care must be taken in
reviewing new findings of revived arctic pathogens. Many of the
laboratories performing this work often also deal with contemporary
microbes, making it necessary to ensure sample contamination has not
occurred

climate change; financial crisis; biological, chemical, cyber, and
nuclear threats; environmental disasters; and social unrest. Chronic
stressors such as ageing and demographic change challenge health systems
and compound the impact of crises.¶ Building the resilience of our
health systems has never been more urgent. Resilience entails much more
than planning for a crisis. Resilience helps to absorb shocks and
accelerates recovery. Importantly, health systems can enhance resilience
by learning lessons which lead to better adaptation in a crisis. Doing
so now is vital to facing tomorrow's threats.¶ The **[[pandemic provided
lessons on what worked]{.underline}]{.mark}**. OECD countries
implemented whole‑of-society responses, including through containment
and mitigation measures. Surge capacity for critical care was raised --
an 8% increase in critical care beds occurred in 2020 -- while other
care, such as elective surgery, was deferred. **[[Health data]{.mark}
availability [and timeliness
improve]{.mark}]{.underline}**[d]{.mark}**[. [Flexibility and agility
in]{.mark} the [health care]{.mark} workforce [facilitated new care
models and increases in crucial activities]{.mark} such as critical care
and vaccination. Telehealth was a positive transformation, with a
dramatic increase in the proportion of adults who had a medical
consultation online or by phone.]{.underline}** By early 2021, almost
one in two adults had consulted their physician remotely in 22 reporting
OECD countries.¶ However, populations and health systems in many
countries are struggling to recover fully as 2023 begins. Disruptions in
care, COVID‑19 infections and the challenge of post-COVID‑19 syndrome or
"long COVID" continue to burden health systems. The legacy of the
pandemic could endure for decades.¶ **[[Three major
vulnerabilities]{.mark} [weakened health system
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ **[[Health systems were
underprepared]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Spending on prevention
accounted for only 2.7% of total health spending across OECD countries
in 2019]{.underline}**. As well as age, obesity and chronic diseases
such as diabetes were risk factors for serious health impacts and death
from COVID‑19. More than a third (35%) of the population aged over 16
years across OECD countries had longstanding illnesses or health
problems prior to the pandemic. Prevalence was even higher (43%) among
people on lower incomes. Multimorbid patients were also vulnerable to
care disruptions, which led to severe consequences and long-term
complications. Poverty, unemployment and socio‑economic disadvantage
were highly associated with poor health outcomes. In the first year of
the pandemic, the relative risk of dying from COVID‑19 doubled for those
living in the most socially deprived areas and for ethnic minority
populations. Symptoms of depression doubled amongst young people in
several OECD countries in 2020‑2021, compared to 2019.¶ **[Health
systems were [understaffed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The pandemic left
front-line health care and long-term care workers overstretched and
exhausted, raising concerns that this could lead to an
exodus]{.underline}**. This would compound the strain on those remaining
in the sector and stretch the resources needed for high-quality care
delivery, including to address the substantial increase in mental health
needs. Before the pandemic there was a wide variation across the OECD in
the density of doctors and nurses, ranging from less than 5 per 1 000
people to over 20 per 1 000 people with an average of 12.4 per 1 000
across the OECD in 2019. Over 11 million fewer investigations and
operations were conducted in 2020 than 2019, leading to a backlog of
cases. The availability of the health workforce will be a constraint in
increasing activity. The impact of long COVID is a large and uncertain
burden for health systems and society: estimates are that 10% or more of
those infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 have persistent symptoms.¶ **[Health
systems [suffered from underinvestment]{.mark}. Smart spending will be
essential to strengthen public health and prevention, boost staffing,
stockpile emergency supplies, increase availability of critical care
beds and use data for better decision making]{.underline}**,
surveillance and research. Many countries increased their investments in
workforce, digital infrastructure and equipment in response to the
pandemic, but this effort will need to be maintained. Boosting the
resilience of health systems requires an annual targeted investment of
1.4% of GDP across OECD countries relative to expenditure in 2019. The
major investment, approximately half, should be in the health
workforce.¶ Below are six policy recommendations to improve health
system resilience. These **[[recommendations aim to reduce the impact of
future shocks on societies]{.mark} [and economies, not only health
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Reforms need to be cohesive and forward
looking. They should not only address current issues but also anticipate
future challenges by ensuring physical resources, data, governance and
financing arrangements are in place.¶ [1. Promote health of the
population]{.mark}: vulnerable populations make for vulnerable health
systems¶ **[Maximising people's health before a crisis minimises the
damage to the population, reducing the risk of death and long-term
health problems]{.underline}**. It can also reduce demand for acute
health services during a shock, benefiting all. Promoting healthier
lifestyles and addressing wider determinants of poor health -- including
poverty and unemployment -- are critical to mitigating the impact of
future shocks on health systems. A strong primary care system offering
universal health coverage helps to improve health prior to a crisis.
Including mental health considerations in crisis preparedness and
response planning should be routine. Improving population health is
cost-effective, and these investments will improve both the welfare of
society and resilience.¶ [2. **[Promote workforce retention and
recruitment: staff are the key to making systems
resilient]{.underline}**]{.mark}¶ Workforce shortages pose one of the
biggest threats to resilient health systems. In the context of the
pandemic, workforce limitations proved to be a more binding constraint
than the availability of hospital beds. A proportionally larger number
of health and social care workers in an OECD country was associated with
relatively better outcomes. The pandemic also highlighted the importance
of valuing front-line workers -- particularly nurses and care workers --
to revitalise health systems. Despite record high numbers of health care
workers across OECD countries, over 3 million additional health care and
long-term care workers may be required to improve resilience. Increased
investment in retention and recruitment will make the recovery less
onerous and improve workforce flexibility to meet future shocks.¶ [3.
**[Promote data collection and use: without the right data, decision
makers are flying blind]{.underline}**]{.mark}¶ Although it is not known
what form the next crisis will take, data will be vital to tackle it.
Better use of data and the tools to convert it into actionable
information is critical to surveillance of new threats and to providing
a better picture of health. Prior to the pandemic, digital
infrastructure was fragmented. Only 14 OECD countries were able to link
data across multiple settings within health care. Key information for
health system management was not available in real-time. Only two
countries reported availability of weekly mortality data prior to the
pandemic. Linked data and timeliness of health data improved greatly in
response to the pandemic. All OECD countries reported improved data
reporting, and almost all enhanced the timeliness of data to inform
policy choices and to foster more efficient resource use. These gains
must be consolidated and built upon to improve the response to future
crises.¶ Investing in digital infrastructure will also improve health
system performance between crises. For future crises, data will need to
be collected and linked beyond the health system, taking into account
the interdependencies that arise during a crisis. For example, few
national statistical offices or education ministries undertook special
data collections related to the COVID‑19 pandemic and its effects on
education (including school closures).¶ [4. **[Promote international
co‑operation: responses will be better together than
alone]{.underline}**]{.mark}¶ Global mobility and connection have
significant benefits but can magnify shocks. International decision
making was challenged at the beginning of the pandemic and the speed of
response was compromised. A stronger international surveillance system
with continuous information gathering, risk assessment and rapid
co‑ordination of responses would have facilitated a quicker response.¶
The unparalleled success and speed of COVID‑19 vaccine development saved
millions of lives. Massive public sector funding was provided for
research, development and manufacturing capacity, but vaccine
distribution has been inequitable. The failure to complete development
of vaccines against earlier coronavirus outbreaks (severe acute
respiratory syndrome in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in
2015) was a missed opportunity.¶ Prioritising innovation through public
support of research and development and exploring new incentives would
help prepare the global community for a range of threats, such as
antimicrobial resistance, climate change and pandemics. Internationally
co‑ordinated approaches are required for technology transfer and
management of intellectual property for currently under-produced
essential health technologies. Credible governance frameworks,
enforceable commitment mechanisms, and stable long-term funding would
facilitate the equitable distribution and use of essential products,
such as personal protective equipment and vaccines, and global public
goods such as surveillance. Global instruments are being developed for
pandemics -- the goals of the World Health Organization and Pandemic
Fund initiatives to foster this co‑operation should be supported.
However, initiatives will need to go beyond pandemics to address a wider
array of risks. Without progress, global challenges will result in
greater disruption and inequity.¶ **[[5. Promote supply chain
resilience: getting products and services when and where they are
needed]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ The supply of medical products hampered
the initial response to the pandemic. Almost all OECD countries reported
difficulties in obtaining personal protective equipment (92%), as well
as testing materials (83%) and ventilators (68%). The lack of personal
protective equipment was devastating. International trade underpinned a
large increase in availability of vaccines and essential medical devices
later in the pandemic, but barriers to trade hampered distribution.
Difficulty in identifying supplies and countries involved in supply
chains undermined the assessment of risk.¶ More detailed information on
supplies, suppliers and countries of origin of finished products and key
inputs are needed to better assess risks and prepare for crises. Having
a limited number of suppliers for essential products is a key
vulnerability. While countries are diversifying their supply chains for
such products, risks remain. International co‑operation around
stockpiling and distribution of scarce products would promote more
equitable and effective responses. For those technologies that are
useful in a crisis, ensuring that sufficient manufacturing capacity
exists should be combined with supplier commitments to ensure access
where the need is greatest. Investing in more resilient supply chains
will not only improve outcomes during crises but also encourage
predictability and reliability between times of disruption.¶ [**[6.
Promote governance and trust: without trust, whole‑of-society responses
are less effective]{.underline}**¶]{.mark} Governance structures need to
reflect the reality that the whole-of-society is involved in addressing
large shocks. Interdependencies exist between the health sector and the
rest of society. An example in the context of the pandemic was the
long-term care sector, which was hit hard. One‑third (34%) of all
cumulative COVID‑19 deaths in 25 OECD countries were among residents in
long-term care facilities by April 2022. About 20% of older people who
received personal care from professionals or relatives (living outside
their household) regularly reported forgone or postponed care in 2021
across 23 OECD countries. Increased integration of long-term care with
health and explicit inclusion in crisis planning would improve outcomes
for the next shock.¶ Trust in institutions is necessary for
whole‑of-society responses. Misinformation and disinformation have the
potential to undermine societal responses. It is critical to actively
counter this and also promote legitimate and transparent decision
making: 19 out of 23 OECD countries reported engaging with the media to
combat misinformation and disinformation at the end of 2021. Involving
stakeholders early and communicating the evidence for decisions is
important to legitimacy. This is especially true when crisis responses
involve liberty-restricting measures and altering of usual standards of
health care. In these circumstances, leadership at the highest level is
required for rapid decision making in the face of uncertainty.¶ With the
outlook darkening for 2023 and multiple crises such as Russia's war
against Ukraine, inflationary pressures and energy insecurity,
governments face tough policy choices. **[However, [smart targeted
investments in health system]{.mark} resilience will benefit societies
by [ensur]{.mark}ing that the [building blocks]{.mark} are there and
[ready for the next crisis]{.mark}. Without such investments, the costs
will be larger and the impact on people greater.]{.underline}**

**[The majority of DNA viruses in permafrost environments are phages
and, therefore, cannot cause disease in humans]{.underline}**. In fact,
[phages are arguably the most well-studied type of virus, and the
majority of them (and viruses in general) are **host specific**. This
means that they can only infect bacteria that are of the same species
and often only the same strain.]{.underline}77,78 Despite phages being
largely bacterial host specific, they appear to be major
community-structuring agents that uphold a diverse permafrost
microbiome. [A diverse microbiome prevents any specific bacterium (e.g.,
a human pathogen) from growing in abundance. This means that, beyond
**phages killing pathogenic bacteria**, thereby protecting us, they can
create an ecosystem where pathogenic bacteria are less likely to be of
concern to humans.]{.underline}79 [Given current evidence of the
widespread presence of phages in all soils, including permafrost, they
are very **unlikely to represent a threat to humans**.]{.underline}

[Other types of DNA viruses, such as Variola virus, which causes
smallpox, that infect humans may be present in permafrost environments,
but **they have not been detected in sufficient numbers or with good
enough quality to pose a threat**.]{.underline}80 Because DNA viruses
co-evolve and replicate in the presence of their hosts, [for pathogenic
human viruses to be present in sufficient quantities to cause infection,
human/animal remains would have to be preserved in a condition that
allows viral survival. However, **this is highly
unlikely**.]{.underline} For example, Variola virus DNA was recovered
from several archeological sites in northeastern Siberia dating back to
the late 17th--19th century. [Smallpox victims mummified in the
permafrost were found, but the Variola virus DNA was highly degraded,
and, thus, **the virus was not infectious**]{.underline}.81,82
[Therefore, although human DNA viral pathogens can be detected in
permafrost, **the risk of infection is negligible** and only of concern
when the virus is intact and present in sufficient quantities to cause
disease. It is noteworthy that, to date**, there have been no reported
cases of viral infections from thawed permafrost in
humans.**]{.underline}

To our knowledge, there is no genetically informed ecological study of
the RNA viral community in permafrost. [One reason why RNA viruses are
understudied compared with DNA viruses is that RNA is less stable
compared with DNA83 and more prone to degradation during the extraction
process]{.underline}. One example of an RNA virus is the H1N1 influenza
A virus that caused the 1918 pandemic. This virus killed an estimated 50
million people, which overwhelmed the burial of infected humans, leading
to mass graves and unburied corpses.84 These mass graves largely went
unmarked, leaving the potential for humans to interact with these
corpses should permafrost thaw. [In the 1990s, attempts were made to
reconstruct or revive the 1918 pandemic influenza virus from frozen
samples, but they were unsuccessful because the **RNA was highly
degraded**]{.underline}. In the early 2000s, advances in technology
allowed successful reconstruction of the H1N1 virus from permafrost, but
it was not viable.80 Complete hemagglutinin (HA) genes, encoding binding
proteins to initiate infection, were detected in reserve-transcribed
RNAs extracted from frozen lung tissues of 1918 influenza victims who
were buried in a mass grave in permafrost.85 [Although this last example
could be taken as a cause for concern, **the viruses were not
infectious**]{.underline}. Ancient RNA extracted from wolf tissue buried
in late Pleistocene permafrost showed no traces of RNA viruses.86 [To
date, there is no report of intact and infectious RNA viruses directly
isolated from permafrost. Therefore, although RNA viruses can be
preserved in permafrost, based on our current knowledge, **the risk of
these RNA viruses being infectious to humans or other animals is
unlikely.**]{.underline}

**No disease impact.**

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable? [Could
a pandemic threaten **humanity**'s future?]{.underline}10

The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the
Plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it
took the lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11

When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed
each other to completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each
population had built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but
were extremely susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by
far the worse end of exchange, through diseases such as measles,
influenza and especially smallpox.

During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and disease took
an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the Americas
during that century, though the number could also be much lower.12 And
it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed
to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough upper bound, the
Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10 percent of the world's
people.13

Centuries later, [the world had become so interconnected that a truly
[global pandemic]{.mark} was possible]{.underline}. Near the end of the
First World War, a devastating strain of influenza (known as the 1918
flu or Spanish Flu) spread to six continents, and even remote Pacific
islands. At least a third of the world's population were infected and 3
to 6 percent were killed.14 This death toll outstripped that of the
First World War, and possibly both World Wars combined.

[Yet even events like these [**fall short** of]{.mark} being [a threat
to **humanity**]{.mark}'s longterm potential]{.underline}.15

\[FOONOTE\]

[In addition to]{.underline} this [**historical** evidence, there are
some **[deep]{.mark}**er **[biological]{.mark}** observations and
[theories **suggest**]{.mark}ing that **[pathogens are unlikely to lead
to]{.mark} the [extinction]{.mark}** of their hosts. These include the
**empirical [anti-correlation]{.mark}** [between **infectiousness** and
**lethality**]{.mark}, the **[extreme rarity]{.mark}** of diseases that
kill more than 75% of those infected, the observed **tendency** of
pandemics to **become [less]{.mark} virulent** as they progress and the
theory of **[optimal virulence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, there is
no watertight case against pathogens leading to the extinction of their
hosts.

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

[In the great bubonic plagues we saw [civilization]{.mark} in the
affected areas falter, but **[recover]{.mark}**. The
regional]{.underline} 25 to [**50 percent** death rate was [**not
enough** to **precipitate**]{.mark} **a continent-wide
[collapse]{.mark}** of civilization]{.underline}. It changed the
relative fortunes of empires, and may have altered the course of history
substantially, but [if anything, it gives us reason to believe that
human civilization is **likely to [make it through]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}future [events]{.mark} with similar death rates, **[even
if]{.mark}**]{.underline} they were **[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
scale.

The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It looks
like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.16

It is less clear what lesson to draw from the Columbian exchange due to
our lack of good records and its mix of causes. Pandemics were clearly a
part of what led to a regional collapse of civilization, but we don't
know whether this would have occurred had it not been for the
accompanying violence and imperial rule. [The [strongest]{.mark} case
[against existential risk]{.mark} from natural pandemics [is]{.mark} the
**[fossil record]{.mark}**]{.underline} argument from Chapter 3.
[Extinction [risk]{.mark} from natural causes [above **0.1
percent**]{.mark} **per century** [is **incompatible** with]{.mark} the
**evidence** of [**how long** humanity]{.mark} and similar species have
[lasted]{.mark}]{.underline}. But this argument only works where the
risk to humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For
most risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done
many things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

#### Arctic zombie viruses won't spread

The unstoppable spread of a zombie virus

In the 2002 film "28 Days Later," it takes less than a month for the
virus responsible for "zombifying" the public to traverse the world. But
[[would a "zombie virus" of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} variety
necessarily [[wreck]{.underline}]{.mark} this
[[havoc]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Simply put, [**[no.]{.underline}** [Viruses have variable
infectiousness, and there are myriad barriers that]{.underline}]{.mark}
[can [stop]{.mark} them from successfully
[spreading.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The most obvious is
geographical]{.mark} -- a virus needs a host to climb a mountain or
cross an ocean,]{.underline} and without one, [[its capacity for spread
is limited]{.underline}]{.mark}. But a pathogen may be unsuccessful in
spreading a disease even when it is able to come into contact with a
host. Disease susceptibility is an elusive concept, a complex
calculation balancing genetics, environment, target demographic of the
disease, medical history, living and working conditions, and more. Most
importantly, [[not all viruses are able to infect
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. In April of last year, [[researchers
isolated strains of defrosted "Methuselah microbes" which are]{.mark}
indeed [virulent]{.mark} -- but [only to amoebae.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The bottom line is that [being exposed to a disease does not
automatically lead to infection]{.underline}. Diseases are
extinguishable in ways that the Hollywood zombie is not.

The inevitable doom of another pandemic

Between its sudden emergence and frenetic spread, the zombie -- much
like the frozen virus -- conjures a sense of doom. Yet [we have reason
to be hopeful about our ability to defeat a "zombie virus."]{.underline}

[[The last century has seen remarkable growth in human
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} against outbreaks.
[Vaccination,]{.underline} for example, [has been]{.underline} nothing
short of [a public health miracle.]{.underline} The World Health
Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization has "saved 154 million
lives over the past 50 years." Between 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19
vaccine is estimated to have prevented at least 19.8 million deaths
globally. That level of [success is particularly remarkable given that
[it took less than a year from the first sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2
genome to the first emergency authorization of its
vaccine.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The world's current capability to address outbreaks of]{.mark}
infectious [disease is historically unprecedented]{.mark}, and we should
not mistake a virus' ability to spread and cause illness as tantamount
to a pandemic]{.underline}. As frightening as zombies may be, their
viral counterparts need not cause the same type of fear.

CONCLUSIONS

Currently available data indicate that there is no increased risk of
human viral pathogen emergence from permafrost compared to other
environmental sources. We do not claim that viral pathogens in
permafrost pose zero risk or that surveillance of putative viral
pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary. However, [[there is]{.mark}
currently **[no evidence]{.mark}** that [human or animal viral pathogens
frozen in permafrost pose an imminent disease outbreak
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Though climate change is accelerating
thaw, [the entry of microbes from ancient permafrost]{.mark} into the
modern environment [is not]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[new]{.underline}]{.mark} phenomenon. [[Permafrost is continually and
naturally exposed to the modern environment]{.mark} by processes such as
erosion, cryoturbation, frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and climate
fluctuations]{.underline} (151--153). [[Humans have been in the Arctic
for more than 40,000 years]{.underline}]{.mark} (Alaska up to 25,000
years and Scandinavia \~5,000 to 12,000 years) (154--156). This suggests
that [[people are and have been regularly exposed to viruses]{.mark}
from permafrost soils, [with no clear evidence for]{.mark} large-scale
health [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### 2NC -- No Zombie Viruses

#### No unique risk of permafrost viruses -- soil viruses can't spread to humans or animals

[The theoretical risk posed by permafrost viruses]{.underline} [with
microbial hosts]{.underline} to human populations [can be evaluated by
exploring]{.underline} the origin and evolution of pathogenic viruses
and examining [whether there is precedent for microbial viruses spilling
over to humans or animals.]{.underline} Host jumps between closely
related species are common at evolutionary timescales; 61% of human
pathogens and 75% of emerging human pathogens have zoonotic origins
(122). [[The likelihood of successful host jumping decreases as the
phylogenetic distance between hosts increases]{.underline}]{.mark}
(123--125). Viruses bind specifically to molecules on the host cell
surface, rely on the host's cellular machinery for replication, and must
evade the host's immune system (126--128). As a result, they are
typically highly adapted to specific hosts and can only "work" in hosts
with similar molecular pathways (129, 130). [[Given the large
phylogenetic distance between soil microbes and humans, such a shift
would be]{.mark} extraordinarily unlikely, if not
**[impossible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Investigating the origins of human pathogenic viruses shows that
microorganisms are not a source of spillovers. The majority of zoonotic
viruses (\>80%) are from mammals, while the remaining \~20% are
primarily from birds (87, 124, 131, 132). Instances of viruses infecting
both humans and other vertebrates, such as reptiles, are rare (131, 133,
134). Non-zoonotic viruses, such as papillomaviruses and herpesviruses,
which are host specific, offer insights into potential host jumps in the
more distant past. For these viruses, the host phylogenetic tree roughly
mirrors the viral phylogenetic tree (135--137). For example, human
papillomaviruses are most closely related to papillomaviruses with
non-human primate hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between viruses
increases with evolutionary distance between hosts (136, 138, 139).
These evolutionary relationships can largely be attributed to
co-speciation between virus and host and occasional instances of
interspecies virus transfer (135, 137, 140). However, there is no
evidence to support a microbial origin for these viruses (135, 137, 139,
141, 142).

[[The lack of precedent for microbial viruses jumping to human or animal
hosts suggests this]{.mark} scenario [is unlikely to arise from thawing
permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Humans are **constantly**
exposed to an enormous diversity of viruses]{.mark} from the
environment.]{.underline} Viruses are crucial members of all Earth's
ecosystems (143), and soils are perhaps the largest viral reservoir on
Earth (144). In some soils, viral abundance can exceed more than one
billion per gram, and similar counts are found per gram of human
intestinal content (144--146). [[Billions of viruses can be swallowed
during a swim in the sea]{.underline}]{.mark} (147, 148). [Despite this
constant bombardment, [there is no indication that microbe-infecting
viruses represent a major disease risk]{.mark} for humans, wildlife, or
domestic animals]{.underline} (87). Research, surveillance, and
prevention strategies aimed at mitigating the risk and impact of future
pandemics do not identify these viruses as potential threats (90, 149,
150). [[There is no reason to think that viruses from permafrost
represent a greater risk for spillover]{.mark} than viruses maintained
in other environments such as temperate soils and aquatic
systems]{.underline}.

-- a gridlock that seems normal until its cause is revealed to be the
outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. Within the first ten minutes of the
film, the zombies' rise turns the world upside down. Our inability to
predict their resurrection is one of the aspects that makes these
viruses so fearsome. In the words of infectious disease researcher
Jeremy Farrar, "if you don't see \[it\], you will always respond too
late."

But [[we are already learning how to expect these kinds of
viruses.]{.underline} [The International Circumpolar
Surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} (ICS) [[program operates in eight
countries, creating a network of hospitals, laboratories, and public
health officials that monitor health status]{.mark} and report cases of
concern. The program]{.underline}, which started in 1999, [is a
"successful example of collaborative surveillance]{.underline},"
supplemented by national disease tracking units run by individual member
states. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, for example,
[operates the Arctic Investigations Program that coordinates with tribal
communities to "evaluate...infectious threats that may be climate
sensitive]{.underline}." These efforts are also supported by the
International Health Regulations, a recently-amended treaty that
outlines surveillance, notification, and verification steps its 196
member states are bound to follow.

[[Viruses can only evade detection for so long, and we have a plethora
of programs to detect their emergence]{.underline}]{.mark}. In all
likelihood, [[we will avoid "World War Z]{.underline}]{.mark}."

### 1NC - No Infrastructure !

#### Infrastructure adapts to permafrost melt. New tech and tracking methods prove.

**LAVAL, 25** (public research university in Quebec City, Quebec,
Canada.," Adapting infrastructures to a thawing permafrost", 2/20/2025,
https://sentinelnorth.ulaval.ca/en/news/adapting-infrastructures-thawing-permafrost//

Climate change is visible to the naked eye, not only in the northern
landscape, but also in its infrastructures. Research teams at Sentinel
North are developing solutions to mitigate the effects of these
unprecedented climatic upheavals. In one of Nunavik's fourteen northern
communities, the clock is ticking. A severely injured person needs to be
urgently evacuated south by plane, the only fast and efficient route
available. But there is one problem: the aircraft is unable to land
because the runway has recently started showing worrying signs of
deterioration. This is in large part due to global warming, which is
four times faster in the Arctic regions than in the rest of the world1
and has accelerated the thaw of the permafrost on which the
infrastructure was built. Although entirely fictitious, this scenario is
not limited to the realm of science fiction. "The airport needs to be
operational for these communities; it's a matter of public safety," says
Jean-Pascal Bilodeau, a professor in the Department of Civil Engineering
and Water Engineering at Université Laval who holds the Sentinel North
Partnership Research Chair on Northern Infrastructure. His work focuses
on the development of innovative, resilient and sustainable
infrastructures in a changing North. "Some factors, such as climate
change, which in the past were rarely taken into account when building
infrastructures, have now become decisive." This is the case for soil
compaction and land subsidence on ground that was formerly permanently
frozen. These permafrost phenomena, known as thermokarsts, are at the
core of the research carried out by Pascale Roy-Léveillée, a professor
in the Geography Department at Université Laval who holds the
Partnership Research Chair on Permafrost in Nunavik. "The
geomorphological changes are visible to the naked eye, in both the
infrastructures and the landscapes," she points out. "Because they don't
manifest themselves in the same way everywhere, there's a genuine need
to characterize the permafrost." **[Working with and for northern
communities These [scientists]{.mark} are [seeking to develop new
knowledge of the interactions between the natural and built
environments]{.mark} in the North]{.underline}**. To this end, they are
**[combining several techniques which go far beyond tracking soil
temperature. "We start by [mapping the geomorphology and surface
conditions]{.mark}, in particular [through remote sensing
tech]{.mark}nology which allows us to see what happens with each passing
season,"]{.underline}** Pascale Roy-Léveillée explains. "We then sample
the permafrost in different types of deposits, among other things to
measure their ice content." **[Taken together, these data [provide a map
of the]{.mark} expected responses on the [ground]{.mark},]{.underline}**
something that is very useful for engineers like Jean-Pascal Bilodeau.
He can, for instance, **[refer to this map [to better assess]{.mark},
both in the laboratory and in the field, [the mechanisms and factors
affecting the performance of infrastructures built on the
permafros]{.mark}t]{.underline}**. This work will ultimately help design
roads that are better adapted to northern weather conditions.
["**[The]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[intended [goal is]{.mark} for these
[infrastructures]{.mark} to be able to [provide]{.mark} their [services
irrespective of climatic stressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he explains.
**[His team is also working on [tech]{.mark}nological
[solutions]{.mark}, such as [fiber optic sensors]{.mark} that perform
autonomous, [real-time infrastructure monitoring]{.mark}, as well as the
use of [machine learning]{.mark} to [better]{.mark} [understand]{.mark}
the underlying phenomena and mechanisms, and predict [infrastructure
responses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The issues associated with permafrost
are complex and require innovative approaches, such as collaborations
between different disciplines, as well as with representatives of
Nunavik's northern communities who are, after all, first-hand witnesses
to this major climate change adaptation project. "It's the coolest part
of our work!", Professor Roy-Léveillée exclaims. "Instead of imposing
our southern-based knowledge, we are co-developing solutions that truly
address the realities of the North." All the more so as Sentinel North
facilitated these partnerships, as Jean-Pascal Bilodeau mentions. A
well-equipped future generation Although the Sentinel North program will
soon be coming to an end, these researchers are planning to continue
their collaborative work over the coming years. "Sentinel North has
created a space where we were encouraged to work with others," Pascale
Roy-Léveillée says. "We are a team of experts from different disciplines
who are able to work together to address issues related to permafrost
thaw. It's of inestimable value. Working together on a concrete and
well-defined problem was conducive to building these interdisciplinary
ties." Many students have been involved in the projects over the years
and Professor Bilodeau sees it as one of Sentinel North's greatest
legacies. "They are now familiar with the interdisciplinary and
collaborative approach to research," the professor and geological
engineer points out. In this sense, the new generation is well equipped
to tackle the challenges faced by tomorrow's North. "Watching these
young scientists as they evolve is an absolute pleasure," he says
proudly. "From the moment that they walk through our doors until the
day, years later, when they leave, they will acquire considerable
experience."

### 1NC - AT: Permafrost melt causes nuclear waste

#### Russian nuclear waste thumps permafrost waste. 

**Starchak, 24** (Expert on Russian nuclear policy, strategic weapons,
arms control, and defence and nuclear industry, as well as a fellow at

Threat", 11/1/2024,

BK)

The war in Ukraine continues to drain Russia's resources away from
critical areas, including nuclear security in the Arctic. Despite this,
**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}** remains committed to the development
of this strategic region, and **[has [not stopped building nuclear
sites]{.mark} there]{.underline}**. In September, Norway detected
**[elevated levels of radioactive Cesium-137 near its Arctic border with
Russia. As Russia is [no longer cooperating with other nations on
nuclear safety in the Arctic]{.mark}, this is unlikely to be the last
such report]{.underline}**. Around the same time that Norway reported
the surge in radiation levels, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
accused NATO of militarizing the Arctic through increasingly frequent
crisis response exercises. Yet Russia is guilty of the same. Its new
foreign policy concepts and doctrines call the Arctic "a vital area for
ensuring our national interests in the global ocean," and
**[[Moscow]{.mark} has [warned]{.mark} that [it will use "any means
necessary" to secure]{.mark} [its interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**
there. Those means include the Northern Fleet, whose ships
regularly---and conspicuously---traverse the Arctic Ocean, training to
counter Western submarines. Particularly crucial to **[Russia's plans is
its fleet of nuclear submarines, which has become significantly more
active in northern waters in the past decade]{.underline}**. The fleet
consists of twelve strategic nuclear submarines carrying up to 192
nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, twenty-four nuclear submarines armed
with cruise missiles, and ten special-purpose nuclear submarines, with
another twelve nuclear submarines under construction or nearly ready for
commission. The **[[Arctic]{.mark} is also a [testing ground for new
nuclear-powered]{.mark}, nuclear-armed [weapons]{.mark}---from the
Burevestnik cruise missile to the Poseidon
torpedo]{.underline}**---**[contributing to both regional tensions and
the risk of radiation accidents]{.underline}**. That risk is growing,
not only because of Russia's military activities, but also because of
its increasing economic activity in the Arctic. Rosatom, the state
nuclear company, operates the eight-ship nuclear icebreaker fleet that
is key to the Northern Sea Route, along which 36 million tons of cargo
were transported in 2023, up from 4 million in 2014. That number is
expected to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker
fleet is to expand by seven more vessels. Rosatom's footprint in the
Arctic extends to Russia's two nuclear power plants there: Kola and
Bilibino. They do not generate enough energy for the country's Arctic
development needs (the region contains trillions of cubic meters of
natural gas and billions of tons of oil), for which Rosatom estimates
that no fewer than fifteen floating nuclear power plants are required.
The company separately plans to build several small modular reactors
(SMRs), the first of which should be up and running by 2028. **[In the
past five years, Russia's development of the Arctic has seen the number
of civil and military nuclear reactors in the region increase by 30
percent]{.underline}**, from sixty-two to eighty-one. By 2035, it is
estimated there may be 118. In response to growing concerns about
nuclear safety, Rosatom has offered reassurances on SMRs' passive safety
systems. **[But environmentalists stress that SMRs are experimental, and
therefore high-risk]{.underline}**. Of particular concern is how they
will be transported. It has already been reported that ships not
designed to transport nuclear materials have been used to do just that,
and further nuclear safety violations cannot be ruled out. In addition,
a 2022 study found that **[[SMRs produce more radioactive waste]{.mark}
than conventional nuclear power plants. The [Arctic's radiation risks
are therefore only rising]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The situation was far
from ideal to begin with, thanks to the region's rich Soviet nuclear
inheritance. There are some 18,000 sunken assets that were or remain
dangerously radioactive, a thousand of which continue to pose a threat.
They include submarines, reactors, and high-level waste. In addition,
the Russian Arctic is peppered with facilities for storing nuclear
fuel---fresh and spent alike---and refining it. Ensuring the safety of
new nuclear assets and managing the Soviet nuclear inheritance is
difficult and expensive, and an endeavor in which Russia used to work
closely with foreign partners. It was not uncommon for projects to be 50
percent or even 60 percent foreign funded, and some were wholly financed
from abroad. The Bellona Foundation estimates that Russia received some
\$2.5 billion in international assistance in this area, in addition to
all the political, technological, informational, and other support from
which it benefited. Years of international cooperation on nuclear
security ended with the invasion of Ukraine. Russia was cut off from
foreign funding, not only bilaterally but also through EU and European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development programs. Technical assistance
dried up as well, precluding the maintenance of foreign equipment and
halting the supply of spare parts. Institutions also stopped working
together, with Russia leaving the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and being
suspended from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. The European Technical Safety
Organisations Network cut ties with Russia's Scientific and Engineering
Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety. Crucially, **[it has become
more difficult for Russia to respond promptly to nuclear
emergencies]{.underline}**. The Arctic is marked by extreme weather
conditions, huge distances, and poor infrastructure. Notifying partners
of a nuclear incident as soon as possible is of the utmost importance,
so that complicated interagency and international coordination may
commence. Yet Russia is out of the Norwegian-led Arctic and North
Atlantic Security and Emergency Preparedness Network and is no longer
invited to nuclear incident response exercises, even as an observer. As
the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster made painfully clear, Russia was never
inclined to accept outside assistance in nuclear emergencies. However,
cooperation with partners was at least theoretically possible. Now, any
prospect of a regional agreement on nuclear security in the Arctic
establishing a joint emergency response mechanism is as good as dead.
Rosatom admits that Russia being cut off from foreign funding means
projects related to nuclear safety in the Arctic will stall. Yet it
maintains that they will not be canceled altogether, which would seem
plausible given the company's financials. However, in practice, funding
is being cut, and the results are clear. Hitherto largely financed by
Norway, efforts to remove solid radioactive waste from Andreyeva Bay may
be suspended indefinitely, Bellona experts fear. Rosatom's accounts show
that nuclear safety is not a priority. Federal spending on nuclear and
radiation safety has steadily been falling since about 2020, and is
expected to be cut by a further 1.5 billion rubles between 2024 and
2026. Cuts of 2.3 billion rubles are planned for efforts related to
radioactive waste disposal and management and the cleanup of nuclear
legacy sites. At the same time, tariffs for the disposal of radioactive
waste are to increase by an average of 33 percent by 2027. The opacity
of the Russian state does not help matters. Gone are the days when many
projects were implemented with the involvement of NGOs, and Rosatom's
disclosures offer so little information as to be useless as a guide to
Russia's plans for the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. The same
concerns extend to Russia's response to nuclear emergencies. Since many
sites are operated by the military or considered key to national
security, gathering information about incidents is extremely difficult.
Before the war, the prospect of a nuclear accident in the Arctic seemed
remote. It was only slightly easier to imagine one involving a nuclear
vessel or a floating nuclear power plant. Today, the situation is
deteriorating rapidly, as **[Russia continues to build new nuclear sites
while halting the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. [The absence of
international assistance and regional cooperation]{.mark}, along with
the [dwindling attention paid to nuclear safety in the Arctic by the
federal authorities]{.mark}, spells further trouble]{.underline}**. That
the risks are growing is no concern to Russia, which may in fact see the
peril of its development of the Arctic as a feature, not a bug. It could
form part of its policy of blackmail, with Russia taking things to the
brink to force concessions from the West such as the resumption of
financing and technical assistance---irrespective of developments on
other fronts. Maxim Starchak Expert on Russian nuclear policy

Earlier this year, the United Nations published the first ever State of
the World's Migratory Species report. The report was prepared for the
Convention on the [[Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
(CMS).]{.underline}]{.mark} [The CMS provides a global venue for
developing internationally coordinated conservation and the sustainable
harvesting of migratory animals.]{.underline} Although [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has not
signed on as a party of the CMS,]{.underline}]{.mark} it has signed on
to some of the agreements and memoranda of understanding (MOUs).

[The findings are sobering, detailing that nearly [half]{.mark} of the
world's [migratory species are in decline]{.mark}, and more than [20
percent are threatened with extinction]{.mark}. Of the 1,189 species
listed as migratory under the CMS, the vast majority (962 species) of
these are birds.]{.underline}

At Audubon, the perils facing migratory birds are all too familiar.
Recent science showed that North America alone lost 3 billion birds
since 1970, the vast majority of them were migratory. Audubon climate
science also predicts that [[two thirds]{.mark} of]{.underline} the bird
species [[in North America]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[vulnerable to
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[due to climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To address these declines, the National
Audubon Society is investing in programs that are designed to reverse
declines of migratory birds.

"Bird migration is one of the most impressive and awe-inspiring natural
phenomena on the planet," said Dr. Jill Deppe, senior director of
Audubon's Migratory Bird Initiative. "Unfortunately, not all migratory
birds are lucky enough to survive these incredible journeys, too often
due to human-caused conservation challenges. It's up to us to do what we
can to protect them along the way."

Audubon's Migratory Bird Initiative has the mission of securing the
future of migratory birds in the Western Hemisphere by reducing direct
threats and protecting key places across the Americas as informed by the
best-available science, conservation and policy partners. Their work has
included the launch of the Bird Migration Explorer. With this
revolutionary new tool, anyone can follow hundreds of species on their
epic journeys and discover challenges they face along the way.

Internationally, Audubon's new strategies in Latin America, the
Caribbean, and Canada are designed to protect birds and the places they
need over their entire life cycles. This hemispheric approach recognizes
that many of the vulnerable bird species found in the U.S. spend most of
their lives in outside its borders.

To secure the future of migratory animals, the U.N. report emphasizes
the [[pressing need to address climate change, habitat loss and
degradation, pollution, and overexploitation.]{.underline}]{.mark} At
Audubon, our hemispheric approach to conservation has been intentionally
designed to provide an international structure that can help us address
all of these issues. Support for public policies like the U.S.
Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act is critical to protect
migratory birds and the habitats they depend on across the Americas.

Trump administration trade policy damages exporters

The Trump administration's trade policy has harmed small businesses,
which make up more than 97 percent of U.S. exporting firms. Increasing
and highly variable input costs, as well as higher borrowing costs, no
doubt are contributing to an increase in small-business bankruptcies.
But the impact on exporters, which account for more than 10 million
American jobs, may be even worse. [Retaliatory measures]{.underline}
that foreign governments have taken in response to the Trump
administration's tariffs, as well as a [foreign consumer backlash
against purchasing goods identified as symbols of the United
States,]{.underline} have amplified the other challenges already facing
U.S. businesses across different sectors of the economy.

Thus far, an increase in overall exports has obscured the impacts of the
Trump administration's trade and economic policies on exporters. In
April 2025, U.S. exports increased by 9 percent year over year. But
export statistics are a lagging indicator. More forward-looking
indicators and industry projections paint a very different picture. For
example, booking volumes of shipping containers for ocean-borne exports
from U.S. harbors fell 30 percent in just two weeks in April following
the president's "liberation day" tariff announcement. Exports from the
Port of Los Angeles, the largest port in the country, have declined
every month since President Donald Trump took office. Deloitte now
projects that U.S. exports will increase a mere 0.7 percent in 2025,
down significantly from the 5 percent annual average increase seen over
the previous four years.

According to the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) monthly report
on manufacturing, which surveys manufacturing executives, new export
orders in May fell to their lowest level since the Great Recession. The
rate of decline of new export orders is particularly concerning, as is
its broad impact across industries. According to the ISM's index, new
export orders have declined every month since President Trump took
office, falling nearly 22 percent in just four months, the fastest drop
since the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 18 industries ISM surveyed in May,
15 reported a decline in new export orders.

Trump's tariffs have raised the cost of importing essential materials
and component parts that American exporters need to produce goods
domestically for sale abroad. For example, Bivo, a Vermont-based small
business that sells stainless steel water bottles, estimated a 30
percent reduction in sales from its previous estimates as a result of
the Trump administration's new tariffs on China. A Pennsylvania-based
company that manufactures robotic systems for food packaging said it was
struggling to remain competitive, as tariffs on robotics equipment from
Europe have raised input costs and reduced demand, forcing the owner to
delay business investments.

What's behind the decline in U.S. export competitiveness?

The decline in U.S. export competitiveness is likely driven by several
factors, all of them related to the Trump administration's reckless
trade and economic policies:

Retaliatory tariffs are making it harder for U.S. exporters to compete.
U.S. exporters are already confronting retaliatory tariffs in several
markets, including China, Canada, and the European Union. Mexico and the
EU have readied additional retaliatory measures, in the event that the
Trump administration maintains its 50 percent tariff on steel and
aluminum or reinstates the "reciprocal" tariffs it announced in early
April but paused soon thereafter.

Agricultural, aerospace, and semiconductor companies have already proved
particularly vulnerable to China's retaliatory tariffs. According to a
March analysis by The New York Times, smaller manufacturing communities
in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, and elsewhere stand to be particularly
hard hit by the retaliatory actions of foreign governments.

How Retaliation Against the Trump Administration's Trade War Makes Each
State Vulnerable

Apr 17, 2025

Foreign consumers are boycotting goods associated with the United
States. U.S. exporters face a foreign consumer backlash against products
or companies associated with the United States. Eighty-five percent of
Canadians who responded to a recent poll reported replacing U.S.
products with non-U.S. alternatives or planning to do so. Already, U.S.
exports to Canada were down more than 11 percent in April 2025 compared
with April 2024.

In France, a recent survey found that 32 percent of consumers were
already boycotting American brands, with nearly twice that amount
considering boycotts. Seventy percent of Swedes polled in March said
they had refrained or were considering refraining from "buying American
products as a form of political protest." The New York Times reported
that "in a Swedish Facebook group with over 80,000 members, users ask
for tips on buying non-American laptops, dog food and toothpaste." In
Germany, 64 percent of respondents to one poll said they "prefer to
avoid US products, if possible." It is not inconceivable that exports to
these European countries, which saw tariff threats several weeks after
those made against Canada, will soon follow a pattern of decline similar
to Canada's.

[[American farmers have]{.mark}]{.underline} certainly felt the impact
of the Trump administration's trade wars in the form of [[lost export
sales]{.underline}]{.mark}. [U.S. [exports of wheat and soybeans]{.mark}
[to China]{.mark}, for example, have [declined 11]{.mark} percent a[nd
25 percent]{.mark}, respectively, since April 2024.\*]{.underline} In
the case of soybeans, the loss of the Chinese market is particularly
damaging, as **[[China accounted for more than half of all U.S. exports
in the sector]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is now projecting an overall decline in total American
agricultural exports in 2025, with exports falling to a level not seen
since the pandemic.

The Chinese government has even involved itself in helping Chinese
buyers backfill orders that would have gone to American suppliers.
President Xi Jinping hosted a summit of Latin American leaders, helping
Brazilian farmers, for example, find new buyers for their products. Even
American beef, once a staple in high-end Chinese restaurants, has been
replaced by beef produced in Australia.

The Trump administration has gutted the programs that help U.S.
exporters compete. The loss of potential export markets for U.S.
producers is made worse by the Trump administration's gutting of the
federal agencies designed to help exporters compete abroad. The Minority
Business Development Agency has been essentially shuttered. The Small
Business Administration has announced plans to slash its workforce by
more than 40 percent. And the International Trade Administration is
facing an unprecedented budget cut, as the administration seeks to
refocus the agency away from supporting exporters and toward trade
enforcement and investment attraction.

Conclusion

The Trump administration's abandonment of U.S. exporters is particularly
shortsighted, given that companies that export tend to pay their
employees better wages and are more resilient in the face of economic
downturns. Manufacturing jobs are particularly reliant on exports, with
nearly 45 percent of U.S. manufacturing output exported every year. And
while larger multinational firms can largely navigate global markets on
their own, smaller firms often need help identifying potential foreign
buyers, financing their export sales, and resolving trade
disputes---functions that the agencies slashed by the Trump
administration provided. The resulting challenges are yet another sad
result of the administration's disastrous trade and economic policies.

The Trump administration's [[assault on immigrants is starting to hit
the American food supply.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for
cheap labor -- to plant, harvest and haul produce -- have reported that
workers are staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (Ice). In Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been
forced to close as the immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and
other law enforcement.

"[[Farm workers]{.mark} in many states [are thinking about leaving the
country]{.mark} [because they are facing]{.mark} more [obstacles]{.mark}
to work under this anti-immigrant administration,]{.underline}" said
Elizabeth Rodriguez, director of farm worker advocacy with National Farm
Worker Ministry, a longstanding organization in south Texas. "[They are
scared, there are fewer opportunities, and they are no longer prospering
here. Their fear will soon be seen in the harvest, when the quantities
of produce are depleted."]{.underline}

From farm to table, [at least one in five jobs in the food industry is
carried out by immigrants,]{.underline} the equivalent of 14 million
workers across the sector. This includes [[27% of agricultural
workers]{.underline}]{.mark} nationwide and 33% of meatpackers. In
restaurants, 46% of chefs and 31% of cooks [[were born outside the
US]{.mark} -- mostly in Mexico, China, Guatemala and El
Salvador.]{.underline}

These jobs are critical: immigrants made up a disproportionate number of
"essential" workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, and many were exposed
to unsafe conditions so that crops could be harvested, cows milked and
takeout delivered.

"Whether it's the workers behind the scenes in meatpacking plants or on
the frontlines of the grocery store, our country relies heavily on the
labor of immigrants to keep our food system running and our families
fed," said Mark Lauritsen, international vice-president at United Food
and Commercial Workers International Union. "Without a stable, skilled
workforce, safety and quality can decline, shelves can sit empty and
grocery prices could rise even more."

Yet food industry jobs, from fields to slaughterhouses and supermarkets
to delivery drivers, are notoriously difficult and often low-paid:
sometimes as little as \$7.25 per hour, the federal minimum wage.
Farmhands are often paid only a few dollars per box of tomatoes or
cabbages harvested - backbreaking work with no shade. American food
companies rely on undocumented people for almost half of the most
physical jobs, including the farm laborers who cultivate crops, tend
livestock and build fences, as well as the meat processors who
slaughter, eviscerate and package at high speeds.

Most Americans understand this. In the run-up to last year's election,
75% of registered voters told Pew Research that they believed
undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs US citizens don't want to do.

And now, [[with Ice raids and mass deportations, these jobs have become
even more dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}. At least one farm worker,
Jaime Alanís, a 57-year-old Mexican man, has died after falling from a
greenhouse trying to escape armed Ice agents during a raid in southern
California last week. In response to these terrifying Ice raids which
are spreading and becoming more violent, some farm workers in California
are planning a strike in coming weeks and will be calling on consumers
to boycott produce.

"It is appalling to see the threat of violence and deportation that
immigrant workers face every day. These people play a crucial role in
restaurants, and more importantly in the community," said Elyanna Calle,
a restaurant worker in Austin, Texas, and president of Restaurant
Workers United. "A raid, a deportation means the destruction of a life
someone has fought to build; it means the destruction of families and
vibrant communities. I have seen my co-workers fear for their safety, I
have seen them go into fight or flight mode at the prospect of an Ice
raid -- this is not something that any person, any immigrant deserves."

If the Trump administration oversees even a fraction of its [[promised
mass deportation of 11 million undocumented
immigrants]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[it could lead to major disruptions
across the food system]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[crops left to spoil in
the fields, supermarket shelves unstocked,]{.underline}]{.mark} takeout
deliveries delayed and food prices soaring even higher. It could also
upend rural economies that depend on migrant workers and their families
who live, work and go to school in small declining communities.

"All of this will have a huge impact on the rest of us because the
immigrant community contributes much more than their labor; they pay
taxes," said Rodriguez. "They invest in the economy, and if they make
less money, we all make less, and when corporations make less, they
increase prices so we lose again."

BBEs = Biomass Burning Emissions

Projected summer [warming]{.underline}, [declining]{.underline} spring
[snow cover, and permafrost thaw]{.underline} in coming decades [will
likely lead to a continued increase of boreal BBEs]{.underline} (24, 25,
37), and thus the divergence between observed boreal BBEs and those
prescribed in 21st century CMIP6 runs is likely to grow in the near
future. [Given the importance of BBEs to global and Arctic
climate]{.underline} (2, 3, 12, 13), [we assessed the impact
of]{.underline} increased [BBEs]{.underline} over 2015--2060 in the
CESM2 [by forcing the model with new boreal emissions based on
observations and]{.underline} their linear [extrapolation]{.underline}.
[We found a significant impact on global climate, with **increased
boreal BBEs leading to damped global warming**]{.underline} (0.32
°C/decade versus 0.37 °C/decade in CESM2-LE) **[and Arctic
warming]{.underline}** (0.49 °C/decade versus 0.78 °C/decade in
CESM2-LE), **[a reduced rate of Arctic sea ice loss]{.underline}**, [and
a southward shift in tropical precipitation]{.underline}. [These climate
impacts result from the increase in aerosol concentration
number]{.underline}, which results in larger cloud droplet number, cloud
optical depth, and reduced net shortwave flux at the surface over the
mid and high northern latitudes over land as well as the North Pacific
and North Atlantic Oceans. [These spatial patterns are similar to those
found in response to historical BBE variability over 1997--2014 in
CESM2]{.underline} (3).

While aerosol burden differences and their cloud and radiation impacts
are greatest in the summer (because of the increase in boreal BBEs
during the summer fire season), [the temperature response is greatest
over the Arctic in fall and winter]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
asynchronous [timing]{.underline} in the response relative to the
radiative forcing anomaly associated with BBEs [is consistent with the
seasonal modulation of Arctic Amplification]{.underline} (38): Arctic
summer surface temperatures are constrained to the freezing point over
the melting sea ice surface, attenuating summer surface temperature
change, yet sea ice melt is reduced due to the smaller shortwave flux
(39). [The larger and thicker sea ice cover persists into fall and
winter]{.underline} (40), [leading to cooler surface temperatures as the
thicker sea ice cover insulates the atmosphere from ocean
heat]{.underline}. While [surface temperature impacts over the tropics
and Southern Hemisphere are not significant]{.underline}, tropical
precipitation shifts slightly south in BorealFire relative to the
CESM2-LE. This behavior depicts a southward shift of the ITCZ, a known
response to hemispheric differences in temperature gradients resulting
from Arctic ice cover changes (33), and is similar to the response in
precipitation to historical BBEs variability in CESM2 (13).

#### Existing programs like the Chairship Wildland Fires Initiative solve

Morten **Høglund and** Edward **Alexander '24** (Høglund is a Norweigian
politician representing the progress party Arctic Ambassador and Chair
of the Arctic Council Senior Arctic Officials, Alexander works with the
Permafrost Pathways team, advances understanding of wildland fire,

Accessed 7/22/24 //I.M.D)

The first months of the Norwegian Chairship of the Arctic Council
(2023-2025) coincided with Canada experiencing its worst wildfire season
so far. In response, [**Norway recognized** the urgency of addressing
Arctic **wildland fires** as a critical climate change issue and
**decided to lift the issue high on the Arctic Council's agenda** --
**and beyond**.]{.underline} Collaborating closely with Gwich'in Council
International and several of the Council's Working Groups, the
[**Chairship launched** its **Wildland Fires Initiative** at the Arctic
Circle Assembly 2023 in Reykjavik, Iceland.]{.underline} Six months into
the initiative, co-leads Morten Høglund, Chair of the Senior Arctic
Officials, and Edward Alexander, Co-Chair of Gwich'in Council
International, sat down for a conversation to discuss the progress and
future directions of this important work. Morten Høglund: We are now
about half a year into the Norwegian Chairship's Wildland Fires
Initiative. How do you feel it\'s progressingb v,? Would you say we are
on track with our goals? Edward Alexander: I think it\'s progressing
well and that elevating this issue was absolutely critical. We\'ve
[**hosted several events** affiliated with the Wildland Fires
Initiative]{.underline}, from the launch event in Iceland to various
thematic sessions at different conferences \[see box\]. We have
[highlighted various aspects related to wildfires and **engaged
different communities**, including Permanent Participants, scientific
experts, the International Association of Wildland Fire, and Observer
states of the Arctic Council.]{.underline} Each step along the way has
unfolded new facets and different aspects resonated with the people we
have involved. I believe [the **initiative has sparked a new dialogue
within the Arctic Council, centering our discussions on necessary
actions**.]{.underline} Wildland fire in the Arctic is a cross-cutting
issue that affects many nations, both in the Arctic and beyond. The 2023
Canadian wildfire season, with 37 million acres burning, was a
significant news story, but the impact of fires extends beyond direct
effects on communities. Discussions on what's happening hwith fires in
the Arctic, the conditions that favor wildland fires, how fires affect
permafrost, and how fires are becoming a driver for global climate
change are very important. Morten Høglund: Absolutely. For me, not being
very familiar with the issue before we started this initiative, it
revealed the complexity of the different aspects related to fire. There
are so many facets, and we\'ve demonstrated that [**the Arctic Council
is dedicated to the issue** and capable of **bringing together various
knowledge holders**, from Indigenous perspectives to emergency
preparedness and civil society perspectives. We are bringing in experts
and knowledge holders from different regions and areas of expertise,
**creating a hub for knowledge sharing on fires within the
Arctic**.]{.underline} I see many possibilities moving forward, using
this network to be relevant for the communities and people affected.
I\'m very pleased with everyone who has joined us at these events and
shared their knowledge and expertise. It\'s been wonderful to see the
commitment and how everyone comes on board with this important issue.
Edward Alexander: Everyone is bringing their own expertise, and all
these different puzzle pieces coming together give us a much clearer
picture. Each time, we achieve a better resolution, and sometimes new
insights emerge when we have these diverse perspectives in our
discussions. It\'s been really exciting to see. For example, Rebecca
Alty, the mayor of Yellowknife, discussed the emotional impacts of fire
and evacuations on the community. Indigenous youth participants at the
[meeting between the Norwegian Chairship and the Permanent Participants
in
Bodø](https://arctic-council.org/news/strategic-planning-with-indigenous-permanent-participant-organizations-during-norwegian-chairship-meeting/)
in May talked about how wildland fires have affected them, recounting
experiences of ash raining down while people were evacuated into their
community. Fires also impact village economies by disrupting businesses,
burning crop lines, and affecting hunting grounds, subsistence
economies, and tourism. The societal effects are multifaceted. These
discussions are incredibly valuable, and it\'s crucial for the global
South to understand the significant changes in wildland fire activity in
the Arctic and what it means beyond smoky days in New York or
Washington. This is a larger story, and all the different voices
contribute to it. Morten Høglund: As you mentioned, there are many large
news stories, but then there are also the personal stories. For example,
during a session in Anchorage, Alaska, a woman from Fairbanks shared her
experience from a few years ago when she was pregnant. Winters in Alaska
can be quite harsh, so when spring and summer arrive, people want to
spend time outside. However, a wildfire near her neighborhood polluted
the air, and because she was pregnant, she was stuck inside. This
personal story highlights how wildfires impact people's health and
quality of life, especially when they can\'t even enjoy the short Arctic
summers. Fires in the Arctic have many dimensions, and if we don\'t
manage to address the issue, the implications can be catastrophic. It
could change the entire way of living in parts of the Arctic. Edward
Alexander: We\'ve certainly seen the impact on our homelands. In my
lifetime, 65% of the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge has burned.
That's an area the size of Maryland and Delaware, right near my home in
Alaska. It\'s important to emphasize that wildland fires in the Arctic
are profoundly different from wildfires in other parts of the world. We
have permafrost and deep carbon stores in our soil, like the Yedoma
permafrost. If these soils thaw, they can release substantial amounts of
methane and nitrous oxide, and possibly microorganisms that have been
frozen for a long time. When fires burn over these areas, the vegetation
that insulates the permafrost is lost, leading to significant
degradation of the permafrost in subsequent seasons. We take for granted
that the system is stable, but then we find out that it\'s not and we
see large areas of permafrost thawing and releasing various organisms
into waterways that flow into our communities. We also face holdover
fires across Canada and Alaska, where the fires have gone underground
and continue to burn even through winter. Morten Høglund: And now, as we
sit here in Norway in early summer, we\'ve already learned that the new
fire season in Canada is well underway. When discussing the major fires
last year, it's important to remember that this was not an isolated
event from 2023 but part of a continuous cycle. Therefore, the Arctic
Council needs to maintain ongoing efforts, provide proper
recommendations to policymakers, and hopefully offer effective solutions
to local communities to assist them in their preparedness work. It\'s
also about informing and learning from each other. There is no easy fix,
no quick solution, and fires will always occur. The challenge is how to
avoid catastrophic consequences. Edward Alexander: It is a big
challenge, and there are no easy answers---it requires multiple
solutions. For example, we have been reinvigorating our cultural burning
practices and discussing how to promote mild fire instead of wildfire in
our homeland. How do we use fire in our ecosystem to promote
biodiversity, growth, and the safety of our communities? How do we
promote our Indigenous knowledge and encourage the sharing of ancient
wildland fire practices from our elders to our young people? That might
be one answer that works for us, but we are always interested in
listening and learning from others to share best practices. There might
be scientific solutions, other fire management techniques, and
cross-border cooperation at the operational level. Smoke and fire don't
respect borders; they spread as they please. Therefore, we need a
variety of answers. Morten Høglund: I like the slogan -- if we want to
call it a slogan -- \"from wild to mild fires.\" If we can help ensure
that future fires are milder, that\'s a goal we will strive for. In
Berlin, we had an interesting session with firefighters and experts from
Poland and Spain who shared their experiences of being sent to Arctic
States to combat fires. They found it to be a completely different
environment from what they were used to, which was an important learning
experience. And so, educating people about what is happening in the
Arctic is really important, and it\'s an area where we can contribute.
Thank you again for agreeing to co-chair this initiative, Edward. We
look forward to working closely with you in the coming year. We have a
lot of important work ahead of us. Edward Alexander: Let\'s get to it.

in the Arctic", 7/8/25,
https://wildfiretoday.com/cultural-burning-wildfires-in-the-arctic/\]//CS

[The wildland fire community, along with governments, policy makers and
citizens, need to take a critical look at the role of cultural fire in
the landscapes of northern Alaska, Canada, Russia, and across the
circumpolar Arctic]{.underline}. The Pyrocene has met the cryosphere,
and the results over the last 20 years have been conclusive: NASA's
MODIS data documents some 174 million hectares of burned area in the
circumpolar Arctic Boreal Zone, an area greater than Iceland, Norway,
Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Greenland. While most of these acres have
burned in Russia, Canada, and the United States (Alaska), the message
written in flame and ash is clear: our environment is changing, and we
need to change too.

To protect the Arctic and its people, we need mildfire, not wildfire.
[We need a healthy environment, not a stagnant monoculture of dead
grass. **We need solutions that make economic sense**. There aren't
enough wildland firefighters in the world to fight fires in the
north]{.underline}. How do we tie in a fireline for fires that are
larger than U.S. states, or that burn in duff that thickly covers and
insulates the soil but readily dries? [We must consider the economics of
the responses to these fires, and whether mitigation activities are
successful at the scale that is needed. To maintain the land and its
people, **there needs to be a cultural revitalization of Indigenous
Knowledge and Indigenous mitigation techniques**, not wildland fire
suppression born of arbitrary rules, written for the south, and
incapable of doing what Indigenous practices have proven they can: stop
a fire crisis before it happens, and replace it with a sustainable, fire
resilient landscape.]{.underline}

In the modern context, everyone in the wildland fire community has heard
of, worked extensively in, or planned for wildland-urban interface (WUI)
events. In the sparsely populated north, we do have traumatic WUI
incidents, such as the evacuation of the capital city of Yellowknife in
the Northwest Territories in 2023. People fled on the only escape route
out, sometimes with fire on both sides of the only highway; the fire
advanced 70 kilometers in one day and was a mere 15 kilometers from
burning the largest city in the Canadian north to the ground. Usually,
in the north, fires are in sparsely populated rural areas larger than
any national park and they're left to burn. These fires fill the air
with smoke that threatens the health of people in the north, and, at
times, it pours into cities far from the Arctic Boreal Zone -- in one
instance making the Statue of Liberty's torch seem snuffed out in the
orange haze that descended on New York; it looked apocalyptic, and the
truth is it probably was, in ways we don't yet understand.

[We need new tools in the Arctic to help us better understand wildland
fire in the circumpolar context, and what's occurring with cultural
landscapes]{.underline}. Ideally, a Wildland Cultural Interface, and /
or an Arctic Wildland Cultural Interface could be developed, so we don't
respond to fires in the Arctic by saving the cabin -- the traditional
structural protection value at risk -- but miss the reason the cabin is
there: for the activity of trapping, and the trapline was allowed to
burn over. A trapping cabin can be built in a few days. A trapline,
however, is another story; imagine cutting 60 miles of fireline by
yourself, and having your income taken out of the equation. [We need to
reframe cultural resources and values at risk into a matrix of action;
we need to understand the cultural structures that need protection --
which are different in the Arctic context than elsewhere -- and they
need to be fully accounted for.]{.underline}

[We need to see, and protect, cultural resources on the land; **we must
understand that cultural landscapes have a lot of intrinsic and
naturally developed value**.]{.underline} A stand of spruce trees in the
north may take hundreds of years to develop to the point that lichen
grows thickly on the branches, which feeds caribou on which northern
people depend.

[participatory rights come in two flavors: (1) consultation, and (2)
**free**, **prior**, and **informed consent** (FPIC). On
**[consultation]{.mark}**, there [appears]{.mark} to be a [wide

[requires]{.mark} that [indigenous peoples]{.mark} be [consulted

the]{.underline} [project]{.underline} (including social, health, and
environmental risks, to be assessed via impact studies), and that they
must be meaningful: that is, conducted in good faith and in the form of
a dialogic process, with the aim of securing the consent of the peoples
concerned (as opposed to a series of purely formal steps or a single
encounter).20 [FPIC is a more controversial and, at least currently,
more **limited right**]{.underline}. It applies only in particular and
dire situations --- such as (a) [[development]{.mark} plans or projects
that will lead to [forced displacement]{.mark} of indigenous peoples
from **[traditional lands]{.mark}**]{.underline}; (b) where
**[execution]{.underline}** of **[development]{.underline}**
**[[plans]{.underline}]{.mark}** or extractive operations would prevent
indigenous communities from using their [[**lands** and other **natural
resources**]{.mark} as necessary]{.underline} for their subsistence; or
(c) where storage or disposal of hazardous materials is planned on
indigenous-occupied land.21 The [[requirement]{.mark} of
**[consultation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and especially of
[**[consent]{.mark}** in some scenarios]{.underline}, is best understood

solidified]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Positivist international legal
thinkers drove the [**official [exclusion]{.mark}** of **Indigenous
[peoples]{.mark}** [from **recognition**]{.mark} under **international
law**]{.underline}, evidenced by a few key tribunals and notable cases
covered in this section. This pattern began to show slight shifts in the
early 20th century as minority rights were given a small platform in the
international legal arena.

[Under the influence of positivist thinking from Vattel and Marshall's
**[court decisions]{.mark}**, **international law** [shifted]{.mark} to
[reject]{.mark} any "**[consideration]{.mark}** of **Indigenous
peoples** as political bodies with [rights]{.mark} under **international
law**]{.underline}," which was a [slight difference from earlier
attitudes]{.underline}.49 This happened under four main premises, the
first three premises are that "[[international law]{.underline}]{.mark}
is [[concerned]{.mark} [only]{.mark} with the
**[rights]{.mark}**]{.underline} and **[[duties]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of states," [that it upholds the "**exclusive sovereignty** of
states]{.underline}," and that "international law is between and not
above states" through their consent.50 The fourth premise is that
Indigenous peoples do not fall under the "limited universe" of states
that make and are polities to international law. 51 The primary deciding
factor in why Indigenous peoples were excluded from being in this
"family of nations," was because other states did not consent to it---in
other words, the only way to become a nation under international law was
to be recognized as a state by others nation-states who are already in
the 'family.'52 [This concept moved beyond the earlier theories about
**justification** of conquest through war, and **simplified** the
[**legal legitimation** of **colonization**]{.mark} by providing a legal
mechanism---approval through the 'family of nations'---by which to
justify conquest and [claims to **sovereignty**]{.mark} over
**[Indigenous peoples]{.mark}** [and
**territories**]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 Thus, these positivist
approaches to international law systematically advantaged nation-states
and this framing formed the foundation for the use of state sovereignty
as a conceptual backing in the oppression of Indigenous peoples54---an
argument that remains relevant today.

There were a [number of important international **tribunal
decisions**]{.underline} in this time period that [demonstrated the
dominance of positivist thinking]{.underline} and the exclusion of
Indigenous rights in international law. The first was a 1926
international arbitration tribunal ruling that stated that Great
Britain's claim for the "[Cayuga Nation" was not legal]{.underline}, yet
they could make claim to the Cayuga Indians living in Canada because
they were British nationals.55 The [decision [asserted]{.mark} that
**Indian tribes** were "[not a legal unit of international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}."56 In 1928, an international arbitration
between the United States and the Netherlands ruled in favor of the
Netherlands claim to the Island of Palmas because of its "effective
occupation and display of authority on the island," compared to the US's
inherited claim to prior discovery through Spain.57 Through this
decision, the tribunal ruled that the treaties the Dutch had made with
the Indigenous peoples of the island were merely 'facts' relevant to the
case, but that these types of contracts (ie. treaties with groups not
recognized in the family of states under positivist international law)
were not "capable of creating rights and obligations" "in an
international law sense."58 The third case--- which occurred in 1933 and
is of particular relevance to this paper---was regarding the legal
status of Eastern Greenland. [The Permanent Court of International
Justice ruled that while it recognized the Inuit population in Eastern
Greenland, the territory's legal status was nonetheless defined by
sovereignty claims from the Denmark and Norway]{.underline}.59 This
decision effectively [ignored Inuit claims to **territorial
sovereignty**]{.underline} or Inuit efforts to block and disrupt
Norwegian and Dutch occupation and colonization, an exemplary
illustration of the positivist hierarchy that placed nation-state
sovereignty over Indigenous sovereignty.60

management, **integrating cultural burning techniques to maintain forest
health and prevent catastrophic wildfires**. These sophisticated

Cultural Burning: A Time-Honoured Tradition

[Cultural burning, also known as prescribed or traditional burning,
involves deliberately setting small, controlled fires to manage the
landscape. This practice, passed down through generations, serves
multiple purposes: it reduces fuel loads that could feed larger fires,
**promotes biodiversity, and maintains the health of
ecosystems.**]{.underline}

First Nations knowledge keepers emphasize how their ancestors understood
fire as a management tool, viewing it as more than a threat. [Indigenous
ecological and traditional knowledge recognizes that **controlled fires
help prevent larger wildfires** while understanding that certain plants
require fire for regeneration and that forest diversity supports
ecosystem health.]{.underline}

Traditional Practices in Modern Wildfire Management

The [increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in recent years have
highlighted the urgent need for effective wildfire management
strategies]{.underline}. Yet, [the powerful tool of controlled burns
remains **significantly underused**]{.underline}. In this post, we'll
delve into the [misconceptions and obstacles]{.underline} that [have
hindered the widespread adoption of controlled burns]{.underline}. We
will explore how [fostering collaboration could be the key to overcoming
these barriers]{.underline}. Specifically, we'll look at:

The essential role of controlled burning in fostering wildfire
resilience

The myths that have historically stifled its acceptance

The reasons behind its continued underutilization today

Why collaboration is a foundational challenge

How collaborative efforts can pave the way for broader use of controlled
burns

Join us as we unravel the complexities and potential solutions
surrounding one of the most crucial fire management strategies.

Why controlled burns are essential to wildfire resilience

[Controlled burning]{.underline}, which we also call prescribed fire, is
one of several methods for thinning vegetation and reducing fuels to
mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Not only [is]{.underline}
it [effective]{.underline}; it is [an irreplaceable component
in]{.underline} the arsenal of [wildfire mitigation tools]{.underline}.

When applied correctly, [controlled]{.underline} burns [are an effective
method for managing the risk of larger, more catastrophic
fires]{.underline}.

For example, [a recent, large-scale study out of Stanford
found]{.underline} that [the chances of a high-intensity fire **drop by
64%**]{.underline} for the first year after a low-intensity fire. What's
more, [low-intensity fires continue to provide]{.underline} some level
of [protection for at least six years]{.underline}. Another study found
that [prescribed burning can reduce wildfire intensity by **more than
70%.**]{.underline} Yet another study found that [controlled
burns]{.underline} can [**reduce overall exposure** to wildfire
smoke]{.underline} (with the reduction varying by region).

Other methods of thinning or fuel reduction are not substitutes for
controlled burning.

A 20-year study at Blodgett Forest Research Station found that plots of
land treated with both thinning and controlled burning were
significantly more resilient to the effects of wildfire than plots that
received no treatment or thinning only.

These findings were put to a real-life test [when the Mosquito Fire
broke out]{.underline} in 2022 and breached the Blodgett study area.
[The fire burned through]{.underline} one of the [control
plots]{.underline}, scorching 60% of the trees, [before encountering a
plot that had been treated with prescribed burning]{.underline}. The
treated plot [burned less intensely]{.underline}, allowing fire fighters
to use it as a staging area.

Similarly, the U.S. Forest Service and Klamath Tribes had been
conducting treatments in the Fremont-Winema National Forest when the
Bootleg Fire broke out in 2021. More than 2/3 of the fire's 400,000-acre
footprint burned at a high intensity. Yet, [the areas that had received
both thinning and controlled burns were **considerably more resilient to
the effects of the wildfire** than were the areas that had received no
treatment or thinning only.]{.underline}

#### Controlled fires almost never burn out of control, and are desperately needed for forest management.

Myth #4: Controlled burns are inherently risky.

It's important to acknowledge the kernel of truth behind this myth.
There have been catastrophic wildfires that started their lives as
controlled burns that spun out of control. However, [multiple analyses
have found that 97% to]{.underline} more than [**99%** of controlled
burns stay within their predetermined areas]{.underline}. [When
controlled burns do]{.underline} escape their planned areas[, there is a
subsequent investigation, often resulting in a change in practices to
prevent it from happening again]{.underline}.

The good news is that the misconceptions and [resistance to controlled
burning **are fading away**]{.underline}. During the 1960s, a series of
[scientific studies began to shed light on the ecological benefits of
fire]{.underline}. [By the 1970s, the Forest Service shifted its policy
to allow some fires to burn]{.underline}. By the late 1970s, the Forest
Service had adopted its first policies for the prescribed use of
intentional fire. [Now,]{.underline} the U.S. Forest Service estimates
that [4,000-5,000 prescribed burns are completed annually by federal
land management authorities]{.underline}.

[The bad news is that a century of **fire suppression policies** has
dramatically increased fuel loads, making controlled burns and other
thinning tactics **more needed than ever**]{.underline}. Idaho Senator
John Risch said in 2021, "Idaho is 40% forestland...and [decades of
insufficient forest management have left millions of]{.underline} these
[acres vulnerable to]{.underline} the kinds of catastrophic [fires that
have increasingly become the norm]{.underline} in the West."

Wildfires [shape the landscape]{.underline} by creating a patchwork of
meadows, shrub lands, birch, and spruce forests. As you travel [in
Alaska]{.underline}, see different plant communities by the changes in

Fire Protection Levels

[All lands in Alaska have]{.underline} been placed in one of four
categories. These "Fire Protection Levels" [set priorities for fire
fighting]{.underline}.

Critical Protection: Areas where humans live or habitations are present
have priority over all others. Immediate and continuous efforts are made
to minimize loss of life and damage to property.

Full Protection: Valuable resources, such as commercial timbers stands
and historic structures, exist; however, no human life or habitations
exist in these areas. Immediate and aggressive action is taken to limit
the number of acres burned.

Modified Action: Uninhabited; with resources of lesser value. Land
managers consider trade off of acres burned versus suppression expenses.
Fires during critical burning months are attacked, but a lower level of
protection is provided when risks of large, damaging fires is less.

Limited Action: Areas where natural fires are beneficial, or where the
costs of fighting the fire are greater than the fire damage. Suppression
efforts are limited to keeping a fire within a designated area or
protecting critical sites within areas.

With the threat of wildfire becoming a year-round reality especially in
the western U.S., when can fire be good? And how can good fires help
prevent bad ones? Prescribed burns, or controlled burns, are techniques
used by natural resource professionals to fortify our ecosystems, but
they don't have to be shrouded in mystery. Here's a quick FAQ to help
you separate fact from fiction: What is a controlled burn? Simply put,
[**a controlled burn is a planned low-intensity fire** that is often
**used to prevent uncontrolled wildfires from overwhelming a forest
landscape** by removing hazardous fuels such as low growing
vegetation]{.underline}. This allows experts on the ground to manage
fires on a given landscape based on smoke, vegetation, species habitat,
location and intensity needed, and is [used as a management **tool to
stimulate the natural regeneration of a forest and prevent
high-intensity**, high-heat **fires that can devastate landscapes and**
damage **seed beds**.]{.underline} Controlled or prescribed burns are
also referred to as hazard reduction burning, swailing or burn-off. Do
controlled burns ever go wrong? The U.S. Forest Service estimates that
4,000-5,000 prescribed burns are completed annually by federal land
management agencies, and the agency states that [**over 99%** of those
**are successful**]{.underline}, meaning they remain contained within
the predetermined area. (Independent analysis by the Wildland Fire
Lessons Learned Center and Oklahoma State Extension Service in recent
years tabulated 99% and 97-99% success rates, respectively.) Experts
remain on site to ensure all flames are extinguished post-burn and later
assess the efficacy of the burn. In extremely rare circumstances,
conditions can change, and the prescribed fire can move outside of the
planned project area, resulting in an 'escape' or 'near miss'. Any
damage caused by an escape or near miss requires a complete
investigation, often resulting in a change of practices to ensure it
doesn't happen again. Why continue to use controlled burns? Controlled
burns have been utilized on North American forests for millenia and [are
**essential tools for forest health**]{.underline}, especially in
western forests. We cannot afford to move away from the proactive use of
fire. The window of time for conducting prescribed fire is small, as
these burns must be planned and executed when conditions are right and
when the capacity of trained, experienced staff allows. [**If controlled
burns are not used** to treat the landscape, when a wildfire does
occur**, there will be too much** tinder-ready **fuel** available**,
increasing the likelihood of a far more catastrophic
wildfire**.]{.underline} Can't we just use thinning instead of
controlled burns? Forest thinning can facilitate future fire
suppression, but the efficacy of thinning and controlled burns in
supporting forest health is maximized when applied together. Our
landscapes need this combined treatment, especially in the West, and
thinning alone generally is insufficient to effectively manage wildfires
for ecological benefits (e.g. improved wildlife habitat and soil
quality, competition from other tree species, pest control), and to help
prepare them for future suppression efforts.

#### Cultural burning solves -- enriches land and is better for suppressing wildfires

Accessed 7/24/25 //I.M.D)

Thirty-two thousand years ago this spring, in the eastern interior of
Alaska, during an ice age so severe that the Laurentide Ice Sheet
covered most of the continent of North America a mile thick, **[a
Gwich'in man]{.underline}**, dressed in neatly tailored, tanned, caribou
skin pants and a shirt, **[walked around the forest]{.underline}**ed
edge of a lake, **[dragging a]{.underline}** stick through the tall
grass. At the end of the stick flickered a **[flame that leapt to the
grass]{.underline}**. The snow in the shadows of the trees blocked the
fire's path, so the flames could travel only into the dead grass that
had accumulated, **[thinning]{.underline}** some of the **[dead
willows]{.underline}** out in its maw. The man continued to walk with
his torch, through the portage to another lake, and then another, and
another. All the while the flames did the work, clearing away the thick
grass, making it easier to walk, getting rid of the early coverage for
mosquitoes and biting insects where the people would camp through
break-up and the summer season in their caribou skin tents. The
**[plants that grew back]{.underline}**, he knew, **[would
be]{.underline}** a bit different than what had burned: all nature of
flowers and **[thicker, greener, more lush]{.underline}** plants. The
areas near the berry patches would grow more berries; the bees and the
birds would take the place of the gnats and the mosquitoes; and instead
of a thick mat of grass that could sustain a fire that could race away,
the **[land]{.underline}** was **[neatly trimmed]{.underline}**, down to
its very root top -- a black mat. The fire was doing its work. Not
perfectly, as there were areas away from camp where the fire had
dwindled due to the ground being too wet, or from the wind blowing in a
certain direction. The man saw his kids following him, trying to start
their little sticks on fire, and one throwing snowballs at the flames.
[**Migrating birds would** soon arrive and would **find good food** to
greet them; the **burn would** help **make browse** so
**nutritious**]{.underline} that the birds would all be fat. The people
would have good eggs to eat, birds to hunt, and the muskrat would be
plentiful. Maybe the moose would have two calves, or three, instead of
one. There wouldn't be a fire to come racing down through the grass, not
this summer; it could still come through the timber, the man thought,
but the mosaic of lakes and meadows and sloughs that had been burned
should be enough to break up any threats the family might face that
summer. The man enjoyed the walk, and the way back would be an easier
path, one that could help his whole family, his whole tribe. Today, we
call this man's activity a cultural burn, and, sadly, all too often, the
wisdom in that man's actions has been forgotten, outlawed or not
implemented in our landscape that sorely needs the presence of Dinjii
Zhuh K'yaa, our traditional Gwich'in ways of life. The man didn't have
to cut a fireline with a Pulaski or a chainsaw; he didn't have to work
in a bulldozer cutting a dozer line; and he didn't have to have air
support to keep the fire out of the trees. The snow did the work. The
season did the work of keeping the fire cool and controllable, and the
fire did its work of clearing the land and creating a green fire break
for the summer. The man didn't have to apply amendments to the soil to
make the plants more nutritious, and he didn't have to apply pesticides
to keep biting insects at bay -- the ash did all that for him. The man
didn't have to do anything except take a walk while his kids tired
themselves out behind him inventing games along the edge of the burn.
[The **wildland fire community**, along with governments, policy makers
and citizens, **need to take a critical look at** the role of **cultural
fire** in the landscapes of northern Alaska, Canada, Russia, and
**across the circumpolar Arctic**.]{.underline} The Pyrocene has met the
cryosphere, and the results over the last 20 years have been conclusive:
NASA's MODIS data documents some 174 million hectares of burned area in
the circumpolar Arctic Boreal Zone, an area greater than Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Greenland. While most of these
acres have burned in Russia, Canada, and the United States (Alaska), the
message written in flame and ash is clear: our environment is changing,
and we need to change too. **[To protect the Arctic]{.underline}** and
its people, we need mildfire, not wildfire. We need a healthy
environment, not a stagnant monoculture of dead grass. We need solutions
that make economic sense. There aren't enough wildland firefighters in
the world to fight fires in the north. How do we tie in a fireline for
fires that are larger than U.S. states, or that burn in duff that
thickly covers and insulates the soil but readily dries? We must
consider the economics of the responses to these fires, and whether
mitigation activities are successful at the scale that is needed. To
maintain the land and its people, [**there** **needs to be a cultural
revitalization of Indigenous** Knowledge and Indigenous **mitigation
techniques, not wildland fire suppression born of arbitrary rules**,
written for the south, and incapable of doing what Indigenous practices
have proven they can: stop a fire crisis before it happens, and replace
it with a sustainable, fire resilient landscape.]{.underline} In the
modern context, everyone in the wildland fire community has heard of,
worked extensively in, or planned for wildland-urban interface (WUI)
events. In the sparsely populated north, we do have traumatic WUI
incidents, such as the evacuation of the capital city of Yellowknife in
the Northwest Territories in 2023. People fled on the only escape route
out, sometimes with fire on both sides of the only highway; the fire
advanced 70 kilometers in one day and was a mere 15 kilometers from
burning the largest city in the Canadian north to the ground. Usually,
in the north, fires are in sparsely populated rural areas larger than
any national park and they're left to burn. These fires fill the air
with smoke that threatens the health of people in the north, and, at
times, it pours into cities far from the Arctic Boreal Zone -- in one
instance making the Statue of Liberty's torch seem snuffed out in the
orange haze that descended on New York; it looked apocalyptic, and the
truth is it probably was, in ways we don't yet understand.

From the early 1990s through 2017, [state and [federal agencies
installed]{.mark} about 15 miles of [fuel break that protected]{.mark}
the [southern]{.mark} border of [Alaska]{.mark}'s Kenai National
Wildlife Refuge from catastrophic wildfire. [It wasn't easy]{.mark}
work. [It demanded years]{.mark} of creatively piecing together various
[funding]{.mark} sources, [building **p**]{.mark}**artnerships with
[p]{.mark}ublic and [p]{.mark}rivate entitie[s]{.mark}**, performing
landscape-level [planning, and]{.mark} coordinating implementation
[activities on the ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now [five years
later]{.underline} and [[after two more wildfires]{.mark} that swept
through the landscape in 2017 and 2019]{.underline}, that fuels
reduction [[work]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[expanded onto private lands
owned by **Alaska Native**]{.mark} entitie[s]{.mark} along the north
side of the Refuge. [Partners]{.mark} have now completed 25 miles of
fuel break and finished planning for an additional 10 to 15 miles of
fuel break, [bring]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} total [defensible
perimeter]{.mark} to 35 to [40 miles]{.mark}]{.underline}. A fuel break
is a strip of land on which the vegetation, debris and litter have been
reduced or modified to control or diminish the spread of fire. [[Fuel
breaks]{.underline}]{.mark} can [significantly [reduce the spread of
wildfire]{.mark} resulting from excessive biomass
accumulations]{.underline}, and they can also [[improve plant
health]{.mark}]{.underline} and productivity [[and improve fish and
wildlife]{.underline}]{.mark} habitat. "The overarching goal is to
protect homes and communities from wildfire risk by creating a
defensible perimeter around the wildland-urban boundary," said Nathan
Lojewski, a forester with Chugachmiut. Chugachmiut is a nonprofit Alaska
Native organization that provides technical assistance to tribal
communities including help with forest management and implementation of
forest practices. "Creating a defensible perimeter may also allow the
Refuge to use fire as a tool to manage for moose habitat without
threatening adjacent human development,\" Lojewski said.

Wildfire on the Kenai Peninsula The Kenai Peninsula has about 60,000
year-round residents and the majority of them live within wildland-urban
interface (WUI) zones. A WUI is a zone of transition between unoccupied
land and human development. [It is [the]{.mark} line,
[area]{.mark}]{.underline} or zone [[where]{.mark} structures and other
[human development meet]{.mark}]{.underline} or intermingle with
[undeveloped [wildland]{.mark} or vegetative fuels]{.underline}. And
they [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} typically **[[at high risk]{.mark} of
wildfire]{.underline}**. On the Kenai Peninsula WUI, the wildlands are
managed by the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, the U.S. Forest Service
Chugach National Forest, Alaska Native tribal corporations and entities,
and land trusts. The Refuge is the largest landowner in the area,
managing 150 to 180 miles of WUI along its border. The urban lands
include the towns of Sterling and Funny River, as well as the larger
metropolitan centers of Soldotna and Kenai. The population in the Kenai
Peninsula Borough is 3.7 people per square mile within just over 16,000
square miles. The area has seen more instances of catastrophic wildfire
in recent years. The Funny River Fire in 2014 burned 195,000 acres; the
East Fork Fire in 2017 burned a couple thousand acres; and the Swan Lake
Fire in 2019 burned more than 180,000 acres. Most of the fuel these
fires consumed was black spruce, which is highly flammable. Other trees
on the landscape include birch, aspen, cottonwood, and white spruce.
"Black spruce is our problem fuel," Lojewski said. "It's extremely
flammable. Firefighters call it \'gasoline on a stick.\' It's very
difficult to control fire in a black spruce forest." Fortunately, the
East Fork and Swan Lake Fires didn't threaten urban areas because of
recent fuel break treatments installed by this partnership. "The Swan
Lake Fire was able to be held north of the highway and it never
threatened the community of Sterling," Lojewski said. "The fuel break
was a contingency line, if the firefighters couldn't hold it there, they
had the fuel break as a stopping point. Even though the fire was only a
few miles away from town, Sterling didn't have to evacuate. It also
helped that the winds were not pushing west toward Sterling." Those
fires further demonstrated the value of fuel breaks.[, Over the last
five years [partners]{.mark} have [focused on **treating private
lands**]{.mark} **along the north side** of the Refuge boundary to
protect the communities of Sterling, Salamatof, and
Nikiski]{.underline}. "It was always a big piece to the puzzle, [how are
we going to get the [Alaska Native landowners]{.mark} involved in this
project?" Lojewski said. "They [own lands in **strategic
locations**]{.mark} **around the fuel break**]{.underline}. For example,
there is a powerline maintenance road along the perimeter of the [fuel
break that is on Native-owned land [which]{.mark} would [provide access
for firefighters]{.mark}]{.underline}." Lojewski explained that
typically planners try to avoid building fuel break lines with hard
corners, because doing so makes it even more difficult for firefighters
as they may have to fight fire on two sides of the corner. It's much
more efficient to build fuel breaks with straight lines so they can
fight fire in one direction. [So [working on private lands was critical
to achieve]{.mark} as many straight lines in [the fuel break]{.mark} as
possible.]{.underline}

Lengthening the fuel break's protection In 2016 the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) entered the partnership, which paved the way
for fuel break treatments on private land. NRCS is a federal agency
under the U.S. Department of Agriculture that provides free, voluntary
technical and financial assistance to private farmers, ranchers, and
forest owners to help them perform conservation practices, in this case,
a fuel break. NRCS worked with the Kenai Natives Association through the
Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) providing financial
assistance for about five miles of fuel break. Additional financial
support using the Alaska Division of Forestry's Forest Stewardship
Program, combined with matching funds from the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA), allowed for 100 percent of the costs to be covered to treat the
Native-owned lands. "NRCS was thrilled to join this partnership and to
help Kenai Natives Association perform fuels reduction on private
lands," said Meg Mueller, NRCS District Conservationist in Kenai. "[[The
goal of this partnership is to install]{.mark}]{.underline} a long,
linear [[fuel break along inhabited areas]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
Central Kenai Peninsula, and [to do that effectively, [we must
engage]{.mark} Alaska [Native]{.mark} private [landowners]{.mark} along
the wildland urban interface]{.underline}. KNA has been great to work
with and [they are making a difference on the landscape]{.underline}."
"I was fortunate to visit this project in 2020, shortly after joining
the NRCS Alaska team," said NRCS State Forester Chris Tcimpidis. "I was
struck by the difference between the dense black spruce that occurred
outside of the fuel break and the well-spaced, pruned trees within the
fuel break. Without seeing the Kenai Peninsula, it is difficult to
appreciate the essential nature of projects like this. [But [of equal
importance is the partnerships between communities]{.mark}, regional
**[corporations and government agencies]{.mark}** resulting in the
protection of communities and natural resources in these fire-driven
ecosystems."]{.underline}

tools developed, provided, and [[maintained by]{.mark} a global
community of [experts]{.mark}]{.underline} (from scientists to
practitioners) [[under a common framework]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Successful frameworks]{.mark} such as this [are]{.mark} generally
[public]{.mark}]{.underline} (academia, government) [and
[private]{.mark}]{.underline} (industry groups and leaders)
[[partnerships]{.mark} (PPP)]{.underline}. [An excellent example of
one]{.underline} of these efforts [is]{.underline} the Global Earthquake
Model ([GEM]{.underline}), [[a PPP]{.mark} established]{.underline} over
15 years ago [to address similar challenges]{.underline} in common
understanding and practical measures [to reduce earthquake risk, despite
prior extensive research in the area. The [outcome has been a
compilation of]{.mark} what is now considered the [best available
science]{.mark}, generally accepted and available in the forms of
models, and the resulting [maps and tools]{.mark} that are widely for a
range of applications from building codes to emergency

Although a comprehensive review of available physics-based models is
beyond the scope of this work**[, a large number of different
[purpose-developed fire models currently exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
dating back to the Rothermel fire surface spread model from 1972 as
reviewed by Andrews in 2018 \[20\]. [A extension of the Fire Dynamics
Simulator]{.underline} (FDS) \[21\], referred to as the Wildland Urban

good basis]{.mark} for further development]{.underline}. Higher fidelity
models, such as FIRETEC from Los Alamos National Laboratory \[24\],
represent greater fidelity and hence associated computational cost.
[Much more recently, [efforts]{.mark} to [provide]{.mark} aggregate
[insurance company losses]{.mark} from wildfire, [as well as]{.mark}
limited [measures of site-specific risk, **have been
developed**]{.mark}]{.underline} by the same modeling community that was

[Although a suite of models is required for different use cases, there
has yet to be the coordination and leveraging of efforts that is needed
now.]{.underline}

\<\<PARAGRAPH TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

There are several consortia and coordination groups already in place,
including those lead by utilities \[25\], researchers, and regional
stakeholders, but they lack a common mission and the technical
leadership (driven by leaders in science as well as leaders from
stakeholder communities) that will gather the resources, assemble an
integrated approach, and lead the development, usage, and maintenance of
a suite of tools to best address challenges. Clearly this integrated
effort will include the need for both advancements in fundamental
combustion science (including sub-grid scale modeling of material
flammability, turbulent combustion, and radiative properties and heat
transfer), much of which is already being researched in a piecemeal
fashion. These advancements need to be such that they can be implemented
in a common framework, similar to the Open Source Fire Modeling effort
for internal fires initiated by FM Global in 2008 \[25\]. Key features
of such a public-private partnership effort are as follows: -Core tools
must be open source to reduce barriers to entry and encourage
collaboration. -A high-quality platform is needed whereby technical
contributions that advance the capability are publishable in top tier
technical journals to promote the metrics of success of academia. -The
approach can not be limited by current computational capabilities, these
continue to improve and hence, given a reasonable timeframe of years for
development and implementation, the methods employed need to be aimed at
the future computing. The use of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) with
stronger parallel processing capabilities along with Central Processing
Units (CPUs) with faster clock speeds and more general capabilities, is
already reducing CFD fire model run times by orders of magnitude. -A
governance structure is required that coordinates the needs of those
managing the risk, those providing the resources, and those doing the
collaborative research and development. The number of stakeholders for
this problem is huge, and a diverse and committed board to govern
activities, with focused subgroups including stakeholder engagement and
education (both from practice to science vis versa), will be needed.
This approach proved effective for GEM, albeit with plenty of challenges
in coordination and engagement which were ultimately overcome in part
through diligence and understanding of the motivations of stakeholders.
Conclusions and future research Recent trends show a clear need to
reduce the social and economic consequences of wildfires around the
world. Measures are in place to do so, but none are adequate for the
current and future occurrence of thermally intense, quickly spreading
fires that have the greatest adverse effects. The sheer scale of the
area around the world that can reasonably be regarded in 'high fire
risk' is beyond the level of controlled burns, forest thinning, or
one-by-one implementation of defensible spaces around structures and
homes. There needs to be a collective measure to assemble the current
and future research community in a focused means to provide the best
possible science in a way that can used to prioritize an achievable
number of actions. These include: -Globally consistent hazard maps
-Tools in the hands of the right users to prioritize; ○ resources to
reduce the hazard via judicious prescribed fires and focused forest
thinning in the highest risk areas, ○ land use planning and design, and
○ the implementation of less vulnerable structures and properties in
building codes.

The inaugural beta deployment was in Hawaii. Working with partners such
as the Hawaiian fire chiefs and state and local officials, S&T deployed
80 wildfire sensors and 16 wind sensors across the Hawaiian Islands.
These sensors will collect data that can further refine how the final

//sax

Introduction Approximately 80% of Alaskans live in areas at risk for
wildland fire \[1\], a situation that presents increasing difficulties,
particularly since many Alaskans live in the expanding wildland-urban
interface (WUI) \[2,3\]. In order to maintain public safety before,
during, and after wildfire events, fire communicators must effectively
transmit risk, crisis, and recovery information to the region\'s
residents, recognizing that this audience is comprised of a diverse
public whose various information-seeking habits are informed by factors
such as property size, family status, business obligations, trust,
personal networks, and levels of digital and physical connectedness
\[\[4\], \[5\], \[6\], \[7\]\]. Previous research has demonstrated that
"undifferentiated communication with a general population is costly and
ineffective," \[8\] and fire communicators can do more to tailor
messages and modes of delivery to their audiences. This research
therefore seeks to investigate the following questions: What are the key
components of the wildfire infosphere in Interior Alaska? How do
residents there seek and/or receive information about wildfires? How
might fire communicators better tailor their messaging to meet the needs
of a diverse audience of residents? This research maps the wildfire
infosphere in Interior Alaska and examines how residents interact with
it. The "infosphere" is a system encompassing all knowledge or
information and the networks through which these data are communicated
\[9,10\]. The "wildfire infosphere" therefore describes all information
relating to wildfires as well as the actors who hold or communicate it
and the channels through which it travels between actors. In addition to
working within a complex infosphere, fire communicators in Interior
Alaska perform their duties within the framework of a complex
institutional structure. In Alaska, three governmental agencies are
responsible for wildland fire management: the Bureau of Land Management
Alaska Fire Service, the Alaska Division of Forestry, and the U.S.
Forest Service \[1\]. The Alaska Interagency Fire Management Plan
determines their fire protection strategy while two interagency groups
coordinate statewide wildfire response. [[The Alaska Wildland Fire
Coordinating Group **should bring together federal and state agencies
with village council presidents and Indigenous leaders** to
oversee]{.mark} planning and implementation. Among its working groups is
one to address [fire education and prevention]{.mark}. The Alaska
Interagency Coordination Center [assists state and federal agencies with
initial attack resource coordination, logistical support, and predictive
services. Many of the firefighters come from village-based crews]{.mark}
\[1\].]{.underline} Additionally, specific agencies reach out with
particular purposes; for example, the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation provides air quality advisories, forecasts, and
recommendations for safety precautions and activities levels.
Communication between these agencies and residents is key to success in
protecting lives and property. [Within this system of many different
parts, our [research]{.mark} can best [assists communication officers
tasked with informing]{.mark} the [public about fire]{.mark} [events as
well as]{.mark} jurisdictional officials, including mayors,
**[Indigenous leaders]{.mark}**, and incident management teams
\[11\].]{.underline} To achieve our objectives, this article begins with
a brief survey of existing literature on wildfire communication in
Alaska. Next, it presents a conceptual framework that explores the
components of the wildfire infosphere and the factors that influence how
individuals interact with it throughout the course of wildfire events.
It then discusses the focus group methodology used to gather data and
the portraiture approach employed to present visualizations of the data.
In the discussion of the results, the article describes four archetypal
portraits that illustrate how to conceptualize the diversity of
information consumers in Interior Alaska. The conclusion explains how
fire communicators can tailor communications to reach a diverse audience
using the portraits and examines areas for future research. 2. Fire
communication literature on Alaska Existing literature on wildfires in
Alaska has not sufficiently mapped the related infosphere. Instead, it
primarily examines co-production of knowledge in the fire science space,
particularly the work of the Alaska Fire Science Consortium \[12\],
ecological knowledge differences among communities, managers, and
scientists and their impacts on forestry management \[13\], and the
public\'s risk perception of wildfire in the Kenai Peninsula \[14\]. To
the authors\' knowledge, no previous research has mapped Interior
Alaska\'s infosphere with regard to wildfire, paying particular
attention to residents\' changing information-gathering behavior as
their needs evolve throughout the course of a wildfire event. To fill
this gap, our research aims to construct the infosphere from the
information receiver\'s perspective by mapping the sources and
transmitters residents consult and the content of information they
receive or seek. It then uses these data to develop portraits of the
diverse audiences in Alaska for wildfire information and tools to assist
communicators reach these audiences. 3. Conceptual framework Fire
communicators work throughout the course of wildfire events to increase
individuals' resilience and maintain public safety by encouraging
residents to prepare strategically and facilitating coordinated public
action \[\[15\], \[16\], \[17\]\]. Wildfire events occur in cyclical
temporal phases, with communication efforts concentrating on risk
preparedness prior to a fire \[\[18\], \[19\], \[20\], \[21\]\], crisis
management during a fire \[\[22\], \[23\], \[24\]\], and re-occupation
or recovery as the threat to life and property dissipates \[25\].
Disruptions in risk and crisis communication, such as a failure to reach
a particular audience, the dissemination of erroneous information, or
public distrust in information sources, can endanger residents and
thereby disturb public safety \[26\]. In order to ensure that the
correct information reaches the appropriate audience, communicators must
understand the components of the infosphere, differences in
information-seeking behavior among residents in fire-prone areas \[27\],
and which messages get through and how they are received. Tailoring
messages and disseminating them through the infosphere with an
understanding of the various information-seeking behaviors of different
audiences improves the effectiveness of wildfire communication. 3.1.
Components of the infosphere Renn provides a useful conceptualization of
a hazard infosphere as consisting of a network connecting senders,
messages, and receivers \[28\]. Senders generate data via observation
and collection, analyze its validity, and assign it a degree of
significance, while transmitters broker a message between its source and
its receivers \[28\]. In reality, this relatively simple structure
involves a high degree of complexity as actors can serve in several
roles--for example, as both transmitters and receivers--and information
is often distorted or modified as it travels among one or more
transmitters before reaching a receiver \[21,\[29\], \[30\], \[31\],
\[32\]\]. Along its journey from sources, through transmitters, to
receivers, social processes mediate the way a message is received
\[30\]. The social context of an individual\'s community and personal
psychological factors influence how an audience member responds to risk
or an event \[21\]. Accordingly, the Social Amplification of Risk (SAR)
model proposes that transmitters may adjust messages and receivers may
interpret and evaluate messages, assigning meaning, value, or
credibility to information according to their preferences, interests, or
beliefs \[21,33\]. "Amplification stations," at which messages are
modified, can include individuals, social groups, organizations,
management agencies, news media, and personal networks, among others
\[21\]. Vertical and horizontal exchanges of social capital among
individuals and communities can also complicate the trajectory of
information, as communities with a high degree of social capital can
more efficiently disseminate information \[34,35\]. The resulting
infosphere thereby becomes a complex network of actors, information, and
the social processes that shapes an audience\'s understanding of the
hazardous situation at hand and affects their vulnerability to disasters
\[36\]. Existing research on the wildfire infosphere identifies a range
of actors from which individuals seek or receive information as well as
great diversity in the content of the messages communicated \[37\].
Prior to wildfire events, individuals consume information from several
categories of actors: public organizations with specialized knowledge,
such as fire departments or state foresters, mass media, such as
newspapers, TV, and radio, and community members, including neighbors,
friends, or family \[29,38\]. This information includes levels of
wildfire risk and preparedness actions that individuals and communities
can take \[23\]. Individuals who do not seek or receive information at
this stage tend to believe that wildfire events are less likely to occur
compared to their information-seeking peers \[29\]. During a fire event,
individuals report finding conversations with fire departments and other
experts as well as neighbors, friends, and family to be particularly
useful sources of information, and social media to be the least useful
\[38\]. The geographical scope of an information source or transmitter
plays a role in information-seeking; individuals prefer local outlets,
platforms, and organizations, at times even capitalizing on informal
networks or personal connections with experts on the ground \[25,39\].
The content of information sought and received during a wildfire event
is primarily specific, real-time data about the fire itself (exact
location, size, direction of movement) as well as the material damage
(which homes have burned, if any) and action-oriented (whether there is
a need to evacuate, which belongings to gather) \[25,39,40\]. At this
stage, information-seeking is urgent and hurried, with little time to
pursue details or context \[25,40\]. A growing literature examines the
information sources or transmitters that individuals turn to after a
wildfire event and how this information can be accumulated. Individuals
seek different kinds of information after a fire event, depending on how
a community has been affected, whether or not the individual\'s home
burned down, and when reoccupation can take place \[25,41\].
Accordingly, asynchronous channels might be more effective at magnifying
messages about recovery than synchronous ones, which prioritize urgent
emergency information \[42\]. One clear conclusion is that there are
insufficient sources of new knowledge and ways to store collective
memory for many community-based organizations. Local organizations often
take the lead in wildfire recovery given the variation across impacts at
the community level, but often they lack knowledge about past recovery
experiences or what other communities have done, a situation that can be
improved with more proactive methods to share knowledge across
community-based organizations \[43\]. 3.2. Information-seeking
throughout wildfire events Several models attempt to understand why and
how individuals seek and receive information, investigating the factors
that motivate information-seeking action and what behaviors occur as a
result \[\[44\], \[45\], \[46\]\]. These models emphasize that
information seeking and processing (how that information is
internalized) can be emotional rather than rational, meaning that an
audience\'s perceptions, feelings, and needs play a role in how, why,
and which information is sought \[45\]. By using a bottom-up approach,
the RISP (Risk Information Seeking and Processing) and FRIS (Framework
of Risk Information-Seeking) models examine how psychological and
sociocultural factors might play a particularly strong role in informing
behaviors during events such as wildfires \[45,46\]. Indeed, several
studies employing the RISP model have found that information
insufficiency (the gap between what an individual knows and what they
believe they need to know) as well as subjective norms (the belief that
one should **h**ave knowledge about a risk) motivate information-seeking
\[44,\[47\], \[48\], \[49\], \[50\]\], although others have found mixed
evidence \[51,52\]. The complementary FRIS model adds that trust in
risk-managing institutions plays a strong role in individuals\'
information-seeking behavior, as does perception of personal control
over the risk \[46\]. Yet another model, Planned Risk Information
Avoidance (PRIA), posits that similar factors may influence purposeful
information **[avoidance]{.underline}**, in which an individual
intentionally does not seek information \[53\]. Institutional trust--a
measure of public confidence in hazard management agencies--can inform
which sources or transmitters individuals turn to, as well as what
information they believe \[54\], and varies across cultural contexts
\[55\]. Across studies, individuals report higher levels of trust in
local and "official" sources of information, such as fire departments or
agency professionals \[7,38\]. Similarly, social trust can guide
individuals to prefer information communicated through channels with
which they are familiar \[44,45\], rendering less targeted sources or
transmitters (such as mass media) ineffective \[15\]. Levels of digital
and physical connectedness to communication channels can also influence
individual habits, especially in Alaska, where geographic distance
remains a challenge to communication \[56\]. During hazard events such
as wildfires, information needs increase quickly but communication
channels may be blocked, thus creating a strong dependency on
technologies such as radio, which are not dependent on cell networks or
online connectedness \[57\]. Individuals might have particularly high
information needs in such situations, which prolong emergency responses
and exacerbate the consequences of the hazard \[42\]. These barriers are
compounded by the digital divide, the inequitable distribution of
digital information technologies across a population that contributes to
knowledge gaps consistently disadvantaging rural and elderly communities
\[58,59\]. These factors compound the complexity of the wildfire
infosphere, especially as Interior Alaska sees an increase in social
diversity \[4\]. Local social context and individual characteristics
inform how communities respond to information about wildfire risk and
crises \[6,7\]. In light of this diversity, risk and crisis
communication must be tailored to the local context and with
consideration of the unique characteristics of populations who live in
wildfire-prone areas \[5,50,52,\[60\], \[61\], \[62\]\]. 3.3. Moving
risk and crisis communications forward Given the complexity of the
infosphere, the different ways individuals seek information, and the
variety of sources and messages, information targeted to a specific
audience can elicit behavior consistent with the intentions of the
communicator \[18,63\]. Examining communities in Portugal, Oliveira and
colleagues concluded that "Wildfire risk management strategies must
address the challenges linked to the need to tailor communication to
people\'s conditions" \[64\]. Accordingly, it is necessary to "prepare
different approaches for different audiences" \[65\]. While risk and
crisis communications do emphasize rules such as "Listen to the
Public\'s Concerns and Understand the Audience," there is often little
discussion of who the audience is and how to understand the diversity
within it \[66\]. Risk and crisis communication studies increasingly
emphasize that communicators must understand the recipient perspective
and have begun exploring how to categorize differences in
information-seeking behavior \[7,38,67\]. Research shows gaps in
wildfire risk perceptions between WUI residents and wildfire
professionals, making it crucial that communicators better understand
their audiences \[68\]. At the community level, Champ et al. advocate a
tailored approach in addressing wildfires, noting that differences
regarding communication preferences are among the factors that affect
how best to define locally relevant wildfire preparation and mitigation
programs \[37\]. Despite these advances in wildfire communication, there
remains a gap in understanding the specific habits of wildfire
information-consuming audiences and the ways in which fire communicators
can utilize improved knowledge of their audiences to reach members of
even the most remote and disconnected communities. While many previous
studies recognize the need for tailored communication \[37,64,65,68\],
existing research has not sufficiently explored what a tailored approach
would look like in practice, nor how to conceptualize the diversity of
the information-seeking audience beyond looking at results of
quantitative analyses of demographic information and risk perception.
This study contributes to filling this knowledge gap by both employing a
qualitative analytical approach to data and by visualizing
information-seeking audiences in an approachable and compelling way. 4.
Methods This section describes our research setting and the methods we
used to collect and analyze our data. 4.1. Research setting The growing
frequency of fires and diverse population in Fairbanks, Alaska and the
nearby Indigenous community of Nulato, located 300 miles by air to the
west of Fairbanks, make the Alaska Interior a useful site for analyzing
wildfire communication. [**[Residents]{.mark} of this region
[include]{.mark} [Native individuals whose families have lived in the
area for thousands of years]{.mark}** as well as settlers who have
chosen to move from elsewhere for employment, recreational
opportunities, or to escape the quotidian constraints of conventional
society \[4\]. [**The Indigenous groups have a long history of dealing
with wildfires and the inclusion of their traditional ecological
knowledge**, with]{.mark} its [local details]{.mark}, historical
context, [and]{.mark} long-term [observations of climatic change, in
fire strategies **and communications is essential in building trust
between these communities and government agencies**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[14,69\]. Nevertheless, despite their differences, all residents
require information before, during, and after fire events. The variety
of audiences for this information and the challenges in reaching them
make Fairbanks and Nulato a critical case in studying and building
knowledge about the wildfire infosphere \[70\].

focus in the boreal biome has been on biophysical research by
non-Indigenous researchers who sought to document the roles of fire in
the boreal forest without including Indigenous peoples in the research
process \[20--24\]. With this paper, we aim to start changing this
trend.

As of 2021, there are over 600 primarily Indigenous communities in the
North American boreal biome. These communities are composed of diverse
Indigenous Nations, but First Nations represent the largest set of
communities living in the region.Footnote2 These communities are
disproportionately impacted by wildfire evacuations and smoke \[25, 26\]
as many are located in rural, sometimes remote, [[forested regions
experiencing the impacts of climate change and policies of attempted
fire exclusion resulting in increased fire suppression

activity in the boreal forest of North America is set to increase from
fuel loading \[29\] and climate change \[30\]. [[An appreciation for
Indigenous fire knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} in the boreal forest is
growing, which has [[resulted in a few partnerships between Indigenous

[Over millennia, many indigenous and Tribal peoples in North America's
fire-prone ecosystems developed sophisticated relationships with
wildland fire that continue today]{.underline}. This article introduces
philosophical, conceptual, and operational approaches to working with
American Indians through research and management partnerships in the
fields of wildland fire, forestry, and fuels, with applications to
climate change and forest landscape restoration strategies (Mansourian
and others 2019). Of central importance are respectful collaborative
relationships among the various parties (Tribes, agencies,
organizations, academics, and citizens) that seek to integrate both
indigenous and Western knowledge systems into environmental stewardship
practices. There is a great degree of genetic, linguistic, and cultural
diversity among the indigenous peoples of North America, who comprise
numerous American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribes. Tribal cultures are
as diverse as the fire-prone ecosystems across North America (Stewart
2002). The Tribes, clans, and other sociocultural institutions of
indigenous communities are as varied as the habitats they live in. Just
as there are different local habitats, so there are numerous cultural
uses of the landscapes and species that comprise tribally valued
resources, all of which are affected both spatially and temporally by
fire in some manner. For many Tribes who have lived and evolved with
fire-prone ecosystems, aspects of their traditions, livelihoods,
economies, and cultures evolved with and rely on fire-dependent species
and fire-affected ecological processes. At this nexus of people and
their environment is the genealogy of indigenous fire stewardship and
how cultural burning practices formed. [Analogous to firedependent
species, many indigenous peoples and Tribal communities are
fire-dependent cultures, having adapted to and been influenced or
affected by the fire regimes of their landscapes (Lake
2018).]{.underline} Indigenous fire stewardship, derived from many types
of knowledge systems, can be described as "the use of fire by various
Indigenous, Aboriginal, and Tribal peoples to modify fire regimes,
adapting and responding to climate and local environmental conditions to
promote desired landscape, habitats, species and to increase the
abundance of favored resources to sustain knowledge systems, ceremonial
and subsistence practices, economies and livelihoods" (Lake and
Christianson 2019[). Central to indigenous fire stewardship is the
cultural ability to mediate and reduce extreme natural fire events by
adapting to changing climatic and environmental conditions.
Fire-dependent cultures can be thought of as mutualistic with their
fire-prone ecosystems (Lake 2018). TYPES OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE
Indigenous knowledge, which reflects Tribal communities' metaphysical
and biophysical understanding of their environment, encompasses
traditional ecological knowledge, traditional fire knowledge, and
traditional forestrelated knowledge. Indigenous Fire Stewardship:
Federal/Tribal Partnerships for Wildland Fire Research and Management
Frank Kanawha Lake Indigenous knowledge can help identify trigger
points, thresholds, and indicators for ecosystems, habitats, and
resources of interest.]{.underline} Frank K. Lake is a research
ecologist for the Forest Service, Fire and Fuels Program, Pacific
Southwest Research Station, Arcata, CA. Fire Management Today 30 JANUARY
2021 • VOL. 79 • NO. 1 [z Traditional ecological knowledge has been
defined as a "cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief,
evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through generations by
cultural transmission, about the relationship of living beings
(including humans) with one another and with the environment ... \[it\]
is both cumulative and dynamic, building on experience and adapting to
changes]{.underline}" (Berkes 1999). z [Traditional fire knowledge, as
defined by Huffman (2013), is "fire-related knowledge, beliefs, and
practices that have been developed and applied on specific landscapes
for specific purposes by long time inhabitants." Traditional fire
knowledge encompasses over 69 distinct elements, as documented in a
global synthesis of indigenous people and their relationships with fire.
Included are elements of geology, topography, soils, vegetation, fuels,
weather, fire behavior, and fire effects, along with fire operations,
fire governance, and various social factors (Huffman 2013). z
Traditional forest-related knowledge is defined essentially as
traditional ecological knowledge (Trosper and Parrotta 2012) At the
foundation of many indigenous creation teachings is the belief that
humans are related to all aspects]{.underline} [of their
environment---that they have interrelationships with
nature.]{.underline} This corresponds to the belief that fire is spirit,
an element that is often revered and feared but is also essential to
fireprone ecosystems and fire-dependent species; fire is critical to the
health of fire-dependent cultures. Many indigenous cultures consider
their knowledge and use of fire a spiritual obligation, part of
indigenous/Tribal land and resource stewardship practices (Eriksen and
Hankins 2014; McKemey and others 2020). In many indigenous teachings,
fire is "medicine" for people and land. With respect to prescribed fire
or indigenous fire stewardship, not enough fire can make the land and
people sick (unhealthy), and too much fire can be bad as well (akin to a
catastrophic overdose). Central to indigenous fire stewardship is the
sociocultural ability to influence, mediate, and reduce extreme natural
fire events by adapting to changing climatic and environmental
conditions (Lake and Christianson 2019). For many Tribes, the cessation
of indigenous fire stewardship and colonial government policies of fire
suppression (which collectively resulted in fire exclusion) have
degraded the land and many species used as valued resources. [With
increases in fuel loading, growing vegetation density and the resulting
catastrophic fires are like an overdose of medicine.]{.underline}
Additionally, among indigenous philosophies, if fire is medicine, then
water is like the blood of land and people. Fire is connected to water
at all scales, and water is sacred and one of the highest resource
values (Hannibal 2014). Indigenous knowledge guides fire stewardship in
fire-prone ecosystems for fire-dependent species. Cultural burning is
human services for ecosystems,\* a tool for fulfilling spiritual
obligations in Tribal belief systems and practices (Eriksen and Hankins
2014). The evolution of cultural fire regimes emerged from indigenous
cultural adaptations to form fire-dependent cultures. The spatial and
temporal extent of indigenous fire use varies by ecosystem and habitats
and is linked to fire-affected resources of value. Philosophically, if
fire is medicine, then indigenous fire stewardship and cultural burning
are human services that meet obligations for metaphysical (spiritual)
commitments. These human services achieve biophysical stewardship and
environmental resource objectives and deliver a range of sociocultural
values (Eriksen and Hankins 2015; Worl and Norgaard 2019). Anyone
considering collaboration with indigenous peoples and Tribal communities
should know that indigenous fire stewardship is diverse, with a
distribution of gender, age, and cultural responsibilities among
individuals in a community. Members of indigenous communities hold
various types of knowledge and practice various types of cultural
burning, and it is important to ask what their particular
responsibilities for and roles in fire use are. Differences in
indigenous fire stewardship and cultural burning reflect roles based on
spiritual/ ceremonial, subsistence, utilitarian/ domestic, and
economic/security responsibilities and governance. Working with diverse
indigenous communities (Nations-Tribes/villages), groups (clans/
families), and leaders (governance/ religious) means including a full
range of indigenous knowledge systems (Eriksen and Hankins 2014, 2015).
Anyone seeking to understand the reasons for and objectives of
indigenous fire stewardship and cultural burning should be aware that
indigenous people might not disclose specifics due to their belief
systems; to a desire for confidentiality; or to fear of inappropriate
exploitation, adoption, or cooptation of practices by nonindigenous
peoples. Indigenous knowledge, particularly related to indigenous fire
stewardship, is a responsibility. Those seeking such knowledge should be
clear as to their reasons for wanting it (the use it serves or the
objective it achieves) and understand what commitments they make in
exchange for acquiring the knowledge. \*Bill Tripp. Karuk Tribe.

INDIGENOUS FIRE STEWARDSHIP AND CULTURAL FIRE REGIMES Cultural fire
regimes differ from natural fire regimes, and indigenous cultures have
developed sophisticated burning practices (Huffman 2013; Lake and
Christianson 2019). Pyrodiversity is augmented by cultural burning,
which can become human services for fire-prone ecosystems. Indigenous
fire stewardship created cultural fire regimes by influencing and
diversifying the frequency, seasonality, extent, locality, intensity,
and resultant severity of fires (Lake and others 2017; Lake and
Christianson 2019; McKemey and others 2020). For example: z Frequency:
Indigenous peoples apply fire for specific resource values and
objectives (fig. 1). Such applications of fire are often more frequent
than natural ignitions with respect to particular resources and
habitats. z Seasonality: The timing of burning is often different from
natural ignitions (that is, lightning) and more diverse within seasons,
linked to plant and fungus phenology or breeding and migration times for
animals (such as ungulates, birds, and fish). z Specificity: Ignition
strategies within different ecosystems and habitats are targeted toward
various species used as resources. The continuum from a natural fire
regime (based on ignitions such as lightning) to a cultural fire regime
(based on human fire use) depends on the extent and magnitude of
indigenous fire stewardship (Lake and Christianson 2019). Often, the
objectives of cultural burning are directly linked to responsibility for
using different burning practices in response to topography, fuel
loading, phenology, weather, and resource quality as well as cultural,
spiritual, ceremonial, subsistence, utilitarian, and economic objectives
(Eriksen and Hankins 2014, 2015; McKemey and others 2020). Documented
reasons for American Indian fire use include but are not limited to
hunting, crop management, pest management, range management,
fireproofing, clearing areas for travel, clearing riparian areas, basket
materials, and fuelwood (see Stewart 2002). ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
AND INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE IN SUPPORTING WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
Indigenous science support for exploring management options builds on
the foundation of indigenous knowledge and Tribal traditional ecological
knowledge. Researchers can seek to understand indigenous science support
needs, the research questions of interest, and the management challenges
that Tribes and indigenous communities face. In developing research
partnerships with indigenous communities, researchers should link
multiple lines of evidence using various interdisciplinary methods to
broaden the exploration of indigenous fire stewardship and cultural
burning. Responding to policy directives and management needs,
researchers can explore the treatment-based outcomes of traditional
ecological knowledge and cultural practices as part of their
experimental approach. Including the elements of indigenous knowledge
(traditional ecological knowledge, traditional fire knowledge, and
traditional forest-related knowledge) can lead to a better understanding
of the implications of frequency and/or seasonality for developing
treatment prescriptions and discerning the effects of potential
management strategies. Indigenous knowledge can help identify trigger
points, thresholds, and indicators appropriate to the ecosystems,
habitats, and resources of interest. [Indigenous knowledge can reveal
the metrics applicable at a particular scale or useful for exploring
synergistic mechanisms or effects.]{.underline} [In working
cooperatively with Tribes and Tribal organizations, indigenous knowledge
can guide land managers in the monitoring and adaptive management of
habitats, species, and resource conditions and their desired quality or
abundance based on their sociocultural uses. This can contribute to a
better understanding of the implications of fire effects on the values
associated with habitats, species, and resource conditions (Welch 2012).
In developing a research framework for incorporating indigenous
knowledge, researchers would be well advised to consider the following
questions]{.underline}: z At what scale should forestry, fire, and
climate effects be studied? z At what scale should wildland fire and
fuels reduction treatments be evaluated as management practices in
relation to tribally valued resources and habitats

[As the climate warms, wildfires across the Arctic are
surging.]{.underline} For example, [extreme heat this summer in Russia
led to more than 6 million hectares]{.underline} (15 million acres) [of
land being scorched in Siberia. **The fires were so big that smoke
reached Alaska**]{.underline}. *The Gwich'in Council International (GCI)
has been working with the Arctic Council to come up with ways in which
Arctic nations can cooperate on their wildfire responses. [One project
run by the Council's Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF)
working group is looking at mapping wildland fires and sourcing best
practices---**including Indigenous knowledge**---to better understand
wildland fire ecology. A second project run by its Emergency Prevention,
Preparedness, and Response (EPPR) working group is evaluating bilateral
agreements between different states to look at cooperation and
collaboration and form a new circumpolar agreement on wildfire
response]{.underline}. EDWARD [ALEXANDER is Gwich'yaa]{.underline}
Gwich'in from Fort Yukon, Alaska. He is GCI's co-chair and head of its
delegation to the Arctic Council's CAFF and EPPR working groups. [He
spoke to The Circle about the effect wildfires are having on Indigenous
communities, and why it's important that the communities play a
leadership role in these projects.]{.underline}* How do these wildfires
affect the communities that live near them? One of the things we've seen
is more evacuations. [We've also seen wildfires in areas where they
haven't traditionally occurred.]{.underline} For example, this year
Iceland had its first experiences with wildland fires. Sweden had some
significant wildland fires a few years ago when a heat dome was sitting
above the country--- but it hadn't had experience with wildland fire
before. People are experiencing impacts like loss of economic activity
and health effects from the smoke. H[ere in Alaska, hunting areas and
trap lines get burned, and those are productive areas that people rely
on for food sources. **So, it becomes a food security issue for people
in the North.**]{.underline} Why do you think it's important that
Indigenous People and organizations like yours take the lead in projects
like these? We're from this area, so we know what the history of
wildfire has been here. [We also know how we've managed the situation
successfully in the past. I think it's important to have everyone
involved for the health and safety of **communities across the**
circumpolar **North.** A lot of those communities are Indigenous, so if
we're going to have the best knowledge and local participants at the
table, **Indigenous People have to be included**]{.underline}. **[It
also means having scientists work together with Indigenous
communities]{.underline}** to better understand some of the practices we
engage in and how they can be useful---not only in wildfire mitigation,
but in managing global climate change. Can you give an example of how
Indigenous communities have managed fires in the past? The examples I
always give are [the Gwich'in practices around fire.]{.underline} One
involves burning meadows in the springtime. [These are cultural burns,
basically prescribed burning that **Indigenous People here have engaged
in for a long time**]{.underline}. There are some key  

features that differ from the prescribed burning done by the Canadian
Fire Service or the US Forest Service. For example, we only do our
prescribed burns during a very particular time of year, when there's
still snow on the ground and in the woods and the ground is still
frozen. This protects the plants' root systems and makes wildland fires
more containable so they don't spread through large grasslands and the
taiga forest. Wildland fires weren't historically as large there because
these meadows and lakes would basically serve as containment areas where
the fire couldn't go through. These cultural burns also improve the
nutritional value of plants. Because these areas are burned in the
springtime, the plants have higher nutritional value for the different
species that depend on them, such as muskrats, waterfowl and other
migratory birds. I've seen estimates that this practice increases
nutritional value by 50 per cent for these animals. [Maybe it's just
burning off non-productive grass so that the land produces a wider
variety of plant species that host more diverse animals and insects,
thereby increasing the carrying capacity of the land and, in turn, food
security for Native people.]{.underline} But these practices don't need
to be historical. Indigenous knowledge doesn't need to be historical[.
If we can find and understand more examples of Indigenous knowledge
about wildfire, I'm absolutely certain it will be useful to all of us in
a circumpolar and global context as the fires become not only an effect
of climate change, but a global driver of it. What are your long-term
hopes for these wildfire projects]{.underline}? Well, for the EPPR
project, we hope it results in a binding agreement between all the
states so they can work together on wildland fire operationally and
establish a mechanism to gather and share their best knowledge. For the
CAFF project, we hope it brings forward wildland fire ecology in the
North so communities are better informed about wildland fire. We feel
that if we can get operational folks, Indigenous communities and
scientists to come forward and work together, we're going to get to a
much better place as far as dealing with the impacts of wildfire in the
North. It's a big issue, and hopefully this is just the start, because
we all have our part to play. I hope folks will get involved so they can
understand how to make their communities more resilient against wildfire
and so we can address global climate change together.

VULNERABILITY OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIE**S** \
VLADIMIR KLIMOV, RAIPON Vladimir Klimov, vice president of the Russian
Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, began his testimony by
sharing about the Mansi People in Siberia and their dual-natured fire
goddess who nurtures when respected but ravages when ignored. According
to Klimov, this metaphor reflects Siberia's fire crisis with
record-breaking burns in 2021 and 2023. Klimov highlighted the dangerous
disconnection between traditional fire practices and modern policies.
[While Indigenous communities like the Mansi carefully managed fire
risks -- collecting only dead wood and conducting controlled spring
burns -- outsiders now disregard these safeguards. T]{.underline}ourists
and settlers often spark blazes through carelessness, while **[laws
banning traditional burning allow flammable undergrowth to
accumulate.]{.underline}** In Klimov's homeland, rising temperatures (30
C in May), careless tourists, and abandoned land management of meadows
have led to more frequent and intense wildland fires, while geographic
isolation leaves Indigenous territories without timely emergency
response. Vladimir Klimov also mentioned intensified threats facing his
region: underground peat fires (zombie fires) that shoulder for months,
destroying plant roots and seeds, and species displacement. [Changing
conditions have driven black bears into Mansi lands, Klimov said,
disrupting ecosystems. Unlike the brown bears -- a sacred animal for
Mansi -- black bears are aggressive toward humans and push brown bears
northward, where they attack reindeer herds of Nenets People -- a dual
crisis undermining both ecosystems and traditional
livelihoods.]{.underline} 

[Klimov advocated restoring traditional fire practices such as
controlled spring burns, and teaching youth fire stewardship as **Elders
once did**]{.underline}. Klimov described community-led patrols
monitoring high-risk areas as a necessary method to combat the wildland
fires in critical periods **and called for policy changes to legitimize
traditional burning methods that** successfully managed fire risks for
generations. COLONIZATION FUELS WILDFIRES \
CHIEF GARY HARRISON, AACChief Gary Harrison, Alaska's Chair of Arctic
Athabaskan Council, shared how traditional burning practices -- summer
grassland fires and winter dead spruce burns -- once safeguarded
forests, waterways, and food sources. [In Chief Harrison's Alaskan
community, these controlled burns reduced forest fuels, prevented
catastrophic wildfires, and managed spruce bark beetles. Harrison warned
that without such practices, modern wildland fires burn deeper,
sterilizing soils and washing ash into streams, harming salmon and
trout]{.underline}. In addition, deforested riverbanks also raise water
temperatures, further stressing cold-water salmon already impacted by
climate change. 

[Chief Harrison highlighted that colonization and criminalization of
Indigenous burning practices have disrupted traditional Athabaskan land
management practices, particularly controlled burning, leading to
increased wildland fire risks and environmental
degradation.]{.underline} 

Additionally, boarding schools suppressed Indigenous Knowledge and
language. "Today, even our own people sometimes don't understand why we
burned," Chief Harrison said, noting that the community is now in the
revitalization process thanks to the knowledge of few Elders held from
the boarding schools.

implications: Wildfires in the Arctic,
<https://wildfiretoday.com/circumpolar-wildland-fire-and-permafrost-thaw-global-climate-implications-wildfires-in-the-arctic/>,
Wildfire Today,

Wildfires have been a natural part of Arctic ecosystems -- including
tundra and boreal forests -- for thousands of years. As in other
regions, wildfire helps to shape and maintain these ecosystems,
impacting plant traits, ecosystem diversity, and composition. However,
climate change is making Arctic fires more frequent, intense, and
widespread. The Arctic is warming two to four times faster than the rest
of the planet, leading to longer fire seasons, more extreme fire
weather, and increased lightning strikes that ignite fires. *This
article is from a special issue of Wildfire magazine from the
International Association of Wildland Fire and the Arctic Council. In
this issue scientists, policy experts, community and Indigenous leaders
provide clear insights on what is occurring with wildland fire in the
Arctic and how best to respond, locally, nationally and
internationally.* In addition to combusting vegetation, wildfires in the
Arctic also burn the organic soil layers, which play an important role
in insulating and protecting the permanently frozen ground, called
permafrost, that underlies the tundra and much of the boreal forest.
When vegetation and soils are removed by fire, this can trigger or
accelerate permafrost thaw. Most permafrost has been frozen for hundreds
to thousands of years. Over time, organic carbon derived from plants has
slowly accumulated in permafrost soils because the frozen conditions
slow decomposition, leading to the accumulation of an immense amount of
carbon -- on the order of 1,600 billion tons, or roughly three times the
amount of carbon contained aboveground in all the world's forests. With
climate warming, permafrost is thawing, and microbes are decomposing
this ancient carbon and releasing it into the atmosphere as greenhouse
gasses, carbon dioxide and methane. The release of greenhouse gasses
from permafrost thaw, referred to as the permafrost carbon feedback,
could be a major accelerant of global climate change in the coming
decades and centuries. Wildfires amplify the permafrost carbon feedback.
At the time of burning, Arctic wildfires release large amounts of carbon
in the form of carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases and aerosols due
to the combustion of organic soils. In fact, the levels of carbon
emitted per unit area from Arctic wildfires are among the highest on
Earth, rivaled only by tropical peatland and deforestation fires. For
the most part, this carbon can ultimately be removed from the atmosphere
by vegetation regrowth and stored by ecosystems over a period of decades
to centuries. However, by burning the upper soil layers that otherwise
keep permafrost cool, Arctic fires also initiate and exacerbate
permafrost thaw. In some cases, this is barely noticeable from the
surface but can still generate greenhouse gas emissions. In other cases,
permafrost with high ice content can thaw abruptly, leading to dramatic
features such as thermokarst lakes and permafrost thaw slumps,
generating even higher levels of carbon emissions. HOW ARE ARCTIC FIRES
CHANGING? Long-term trends in area burned across Canada and Alaska,
developed with data from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System
and the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center. Image by Greg Fiske,
Woodwell Climate Research Center. Many studies have documented the links
between Arctic fires and climate change. The best long-term
observational data come from Alaska and Canadian government databases,
which detail fires and their area burned since the mid-20th century.
From the databases, we know the average yearly burned area across Alaska
and Canada during the past two decades is roughly twice that of
pre-climate change levels. By far, the most severe fire season was 2023.
Canadian wildfires in 2023 burned more than twice the area of any other
year on record and emitted between 480 and 760 million tons of carbon.
For perspective, that's three to five times higher than annual emissions
from all other sectors in Canada combined, and higher than every
country's annual emissions except China, the United States, and India.
It should be noted that regrowing forests from these fires are unlikely
to re-sequester much carbon by the mid-21st century -- when the world
otherwise needs to be approaching net-zero emissions to limit the most
damaging impacts from climate change --and that these estimates do not
include postfire permafrost emissions. Novel fire years are not limited
to Canada. Russia, for instance, experienced unprecedented wildfire
activity in eastern Siberia and north of the Arctic circle in 2019,
2020, 2021 and 2024, which has been linked to warming temperatures,
early snow melt, and polar jet dynamics associated with climate change.
If current climate warming trends continue, Arctic fires will likely
become even more frequent and intense. Studies project a 75 per cent
increase in Arctic burned area for every degree Celsius of global
warming. The carbon released by these fires, combined with emissions
from permafrost thaw, could rival those of major global economies. Yet
these emissions are not currently accounted for in global climate models
nor are they fully accounted for in the "accounting framework" used to
assess progress toward the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to
well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Carbon and
climate are not the only causes for concern over increasing Arctic
wildfires. These fires emit smoke that degrades air quality and
threatens human health for communities near and far. Wildfires impact
habitat and subsistence activities for Indigenous communities, can shut
down aviation and overland travel, damage infrastructure, and lead to
mass evacuations. Ground slumping in yedoma permafrost after a wildfire,

amounts of ground ice, making it vulnerable to abrupt thaw after fires.

situation is urgent, and solutions exist. Governments can prioritize
wildfire preparedness and community protection plans, fuels treatments
and fire breaks around fire-prone communities, and improve real-time
forecasting and information sharing, especially with rural and
Indigenous communities. Supporting cultural burning practices, where
Indigenous communities conduct controlled burns to manage landscapes,
can also reduce the risk of severe wildfires. Finally, the combination
of improved satellite detection and emerging technology such as
autonomous firefighting aircraft presents opportunities for early action
suppression of the most damaging wildfires. However, [[the most critical
solution]{.mark} lies in [reducing global greenhouse gas
emissions]{.mark}. [Cutting]{.mark} global [emissions]{.mark} will [slow

[An increasing number of indicators suggest that [no plausible cutback
in emissions will]{.mark} be sufficient to [keep warming below levels
that]{.mark} could [trigger]{.mark} very disruptive [tipping
points]{.mark} \[]{.underline}9, 10\]. For example, the Greenland and
Himalayan melt rates are strong indicators of accelerated warming that
would in turn lead to more frequent and severe climate calamities[. More
rapid [loss of glacial ice]{.mark} in all three poles (]{.underline}i.e.
including the Himalayas) [is [accelerating]{.mark} the [rate of sea
level rise]{.mark}. Polar warming is also triggering]{.underline} a
change in the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation that is leading to
[an increasing incidence of extreme weather, fundamental disruption of
natural systems, and a **[high risk that major critical tipping points
will be overstepped to a state beyond repair]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[However, such an irreversible outcome is not yet inevitable. [Limiting
global warming with]{.mark} one or more direct global-scale climate
cooling influences while also moderating the worst impacts using one or
more]{.underline} of the regional cooling influences (commonly referred
to as ["[geoengineering]{.mark}") might well [reduce the likelihood and
severity of destructive climate calamities over the next few
decades]{.mark}.]{.underline} This would give emissions reduction and
removal time to achieve net-zero and then net negative levels, lowering
CO~2~ and other greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to the
habitable levels of the 20th Century. [Deploying cooling influences to
limit global warming, especially peak global warming, would reduce
stresses on ecosystems, thus [help]{.mark}ing to [reinvigorate the
natural environment]{.mark} over the longer term]{.underline} \[11\].

Despite recognition that potential cooling approaches exist, research
and considerations of deployment of direct climate cooling, whether
localized or global, co-deployed or not, have been held back by several
opposing arguments \[12\] (Others, while not directly opposing DCC
deployment, have suggested numerous checkpoints that do not seem to take
into account the risk-risk tradeoff of excessively delaying deployment
\[13\]. See section "Challenges and opportunities" for further
discussion.). [A primary argument has been that pursuing such approaches
constitutes a "moral hazard" because implementation might well slow GHG
emissions mitigation efforts. However, the claim of "moral hazard" was
for example applied to climate adaptation as a substitute for mitigation
before climate impacts became more severe]{.underline} \[14\], and
[there appears to be little solid evidence for this when applied to
"direct climate cooling"]{.underline} (DCC) \[15\]. Now that costs for
renewable energy have fallen below the costs of fossil-fuel energy this
argument appears to have turned on its head as markets have begun to
favor renewables, but global GHG emissions are still increasing. The
real "moral hazard" is the failure to pursue cooling approaches that can
reduce ecological and human disasters and costs. [[A]{.mark}nother
[concern]{.mark} expressed [is]{.mark} that [cooling technologies could
have]{.mark} severe [unanticipated consequences]{.mark}, [although
increasingly detailed climate modeling has not supported this]{.mark}
speculation]{.underline} \[16\]. Finally, some climate cooling opponents
argue that though cooling influences may be beneficial for a while, were
they to be stopped for some reason, the climate would warm up relatively
quickly resulting in "termination shock" and worse impacts than if the
cooling influences had not been deployed at all.

[Against the termination shock hypothesis, projected costs and
challenges of maintaining cooling influences, when compared to GHG
removal, are much less than other approaches to limiting
warming.]{.underline} Responsible global actions would require
continuance of direct cooling given the severe consequences of not doing
[so. In the face of these concerns, **equitable and responsible global
governance of cooling approaches will be crucial.**]{.underline} The
Montreal Protocol success in repairing the ozone layer suggests this is
possible over an extended term \[17, 18\]. However, the level of impact
has now been allowed to increase so much that adaptation is becoming
critical. Climate restoration measures to mitigate the increasing
threats to global sustainability and governance must be stronger than
the UNFCCC has endorsed \[19\] (By these statements regarding the
governance problem of achieving rapid and at-scale emissions reductions,
we do not mean to suggest that, particularly global-scale, DCC
implementation and governance is not a challenge. Rather, using SAI as
an example, it poses a different kind of governance challenge, having
less to do with overcoming a costly resource intensive free-rider public
good problem, and more to do with transparency and public trust for a
very inexpensive, almost "free-driver", global leverage problem \[20\].
See further discussion in section "Challenges and opportunities".).

[The needed governance for comprehensively limiting global warming **is
not yet in place.**]{.underline} This is suggested by the failure to
consider the climatic effects of the 2020 International Maritime
Organization (IMO) regulations aimed at reducing sulfur emissions from
the "bunker fuel" used to power cargo ships to protect public health.
Observations of accelerated warming estimate that the regulations have
unintentionally triggered rapid global warming of 0.1--10 W/m^2^ not
unlike the suggested "termination shock" \[2, 21--25\]. Considering that
recent (i.e. January 2020--June 2023) CERES data on the total Earth
Energy Imbalance, or total excess energy from the sun absorbed by the
earth, averages 1.37 W/m^2^ compared an earlier (January 2015 to
December 2019) average of 1.12 W/m^2^, all of these estimates suggest
that a significant global heating impact has resulted from the
regulations, as there are no other indications of such a large positive
forcing \[2, 22, 26\]. This sudden warming should lead to IMO and
governments coming together to respond to the problem by assessing
relevant direct cooling influences as proposed in \[23\]. A further
concern regarding the potential deployment of cooling influences has
been whether there are means to verify their performance before
proceeding beyond very limited deployment. For most of the proposed
cooling approaches described in this paper, pilot [testing
would]{.underline} have only local and transitory effects and [could be
conducted transparently under local to national governance without
requiring special approval and oversight by international governance
bodies. Global climate models and other methods that simulate the
climatic responses to both natural and human-induced forcings make it
possible in many cases to evaluate major potential impacts on the
atmosphere]{.underline}, oceans, and biosphere of the various types of
cooling influences with reasonable confidence. Unfortunately,
[[sufficient research funds have yet to be provided]{.underline}]{.mark}
for many of the proposed approaches even though the cost would be very
small compared to the likely benefits their deployment would deliver
\[27\].

Concerns represented in opposing arguments need to be addressed in any
program advancing direct climate cooling, as discussed further in
section "Challenges and opportunities" of this paper. However, the
reality of accelerated warming, more intense catastrophic events and
ever-increasing damage and loss has not enabled overall reduction in GHG
emissions, much less support for a comprehensive research and
demonstration effort focused on possible cooling approaches. The moral
hazard no longer lies in researching and deploying climate cooling
approaches, but now in the failure to explore all feasible approaches to
reduce near-term global warming. How best to proceed can only be settled
by a "risk-risk approach," comparing, and contrasting the possible risks
of outcomes in which climate cooling approaches are applied against
those that lie ahead if directly cooling the climate is not pursued
\[2\].

[Many of the climate cooling approaches are low-tech and can be
responsibly deployed at local to regional scales with few,]{.underline}
if any, potential risks and often, many co-benefits. Similarly, [various
of the global-scale approaches can be tested and implemented at low
intensity using an "apply, evaluate, adjust" sequencing because their
effects are readily reversible if unexpected, potentially deleterious
consequences arise.]{.underline} Climate change and especially polar
amplification, or disproportionate warming of polar regions relative to
mid-latitudes, have already caused enormous damage. [[Further loss of
sea ice and]{.mark} particularly of [glacial ice]{.mark} seem likely to
[accelerate the risk of catastrophic impacts
worldwide.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This paper describes more than a dozen potential direct climate cooling
approaches that merit initial consideration. More approaches, including
variants of those presented here, continue to emerge. The summaries of
the approaches that follow have been prepared primarily by those who are
currently researching or promoting them. They are listed here in
alphabetical order rather than, at this point, seeking to group them by
metrics or qualitative characteristics (see section "Potential
approaches for direct climate cooling," Tables 1 and 2). They are:
\[Figure omitted\] We do not claim that this is an exhaustive list of
all possible cooling approaches. For example, we have not included a
summary of potential space-based DCC approaches that proponents suggest
"be seriously considered in the long term" \[28\] (Abstract) rather than
the near-term (next few decades) time-period during which we believe DCC
is urgently necessary (Other examples are the sixty-one mostly
geophysical "climate intervention" approaches listed in \[29\], with
some overlap with our paper but with a specific Arctic region focus
rather than urgent global DCC.).

With GHG emission reduction and removal proceeding at insufficient pace
or scale to effectively keep warming below 1.5°C, 2.0°C or higher, [we
believe it is essential that direct climate cooling be added to the
frontal set of policy options]{.underline} being considered by
international negotiators and national governments. While GHG emissions
reduction and removal may have the potential to achieve net-zero
emissions in the second half of the 21st century and, over time, to
reduce GHG concentrations, [direct cooling options provide the only way
to impel global warming back toward 1°C and below before even more key
tipping points are passed]{.underline} (The rationale for a global
warming threshold of 1°C is discussed at the end of section "The risks
of not slowing the pace of global climate change".).

[A credible and effective plan to restore the relatively beneficial
climatic conditions of the 20th century would require that negotiators
develop a three-component strategy:]{.underline} (i) [researching, field
testing, and deploying one or more large-scale cooling
influence(]{.underline}s) perhaps [initially in polar
regions]{.underline} and applying local and regional cooling measures
that also support adaptation, (ii) accelerating emissions reductions
with an early prioritization of short-lived climate drivers (Net human
emissions must be cut to zero, global warming induced increases in
natural emissions must be offset with negative human emissions and over
a trillion tons of legacy CO2eq GHG of all types that has accumulated in
the atmosphere and oceans removed, to restore a stable climate not
counting already triggered irreversible feedbacks that may continue for
centuries \[11\] (footnote 9) \[2\]. However, as the rate of emissions
of short-lived GHG such as methane is directly correlated with warming
these should be prioritized to urgently achieve DCC.), and (iii)
deploying large scale carbon removal to draw down legacy greenhouse gas.

[[Humanity has never faced an existential threat so critical to the
survival of civilization and our fellow living species on this
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. Over at least the next several decades, and
possibly much longer, direct cooling influences will be needed to keep
climate change and its especially severe adverse impacts from spiraling
out of control. [[Only the application of such emergency cooling
"tourniquets," applied as soon as reasonably feasible in a

potential to slow or reverse ongoing climate

sea ice melting", Scientific Reports, 04/12/35,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-96607-1#Sec1)

[In the rapidly warming and wetting Arctic, the time of emergence (ToE)
of a new climate state occurs when trends of climate indicators are
large enough to surpass the strong natural climate fluctuations in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Thus far, uncertainties in climate model
projections, variability and methods have yielded diverging estimates of
Arctic ToE. Here we use a robust method and future projections of
multiple state-of-the-art climate models to show that, generally, sea
ice thickness (2036--2051) and surface air temperature (2033--2050)
emerge first, followed by sea ice cover (2039--2074), and
precipitation/rainfall (after 2077). Autumn generally exhibits the
earliest ToE-values due to rapid sea ice retreat. The earliest ToE for
temperature and sea ice thickness occurs in the Central Arctic, whereas
sea ice cover and rainfall first emerge in the Barents Sea region. [Most
regions of the Arctic are close to a new climate state (for temperature
and sea ice), with wide-ranging and possibly irreversible consequences
for vulnerable Arctic ecosystems and human activities.]{.underline}

In view of recent global increases in the occurrence of climate
change-related natural disasters1,2,3, there is enhanced interest in
determining whether extreme climate conditions are a regular feature of
the current climate, or if they pose evidence of a new climate state
having emerged. [One of the most vulnerable regions to climate change is
the Arctic, which is warming two to four times faster than the global
average over the last decades4]{.underline},5,6, while also getting
considerably wetter7,8,9,10. Understanding when the effects of
anthropogenic climate change in the Arctic have/will become
distinguishable from natural climate fluctuations is crucial for
policymakers to develop effective mitigation and adaptation strategies,
and to identify and quantify (potentially irreversible) impacts on
vulnerable Arctic ecosystems. [A useful metric to establish when the
forced climate change trend emerges from the 'background noise', or
natural climate variability, is the time of emergence
(ToE).]{.underline}

Thus far, the few studies that addressed Arctic ToE have provided
inconclusive and diverging results, mainly because the methods to
evaluate ToE and the climate variables/metrics that have been assessed
differ greatly. Previous estimates of ToE for Arctic Amplification12,
surface air temperature16, shortwave radiation11, sea ice extent
(SIE)16, the freshwater budget15, or solar absorption14 focused on only
one or a few variables and concluded that the forced trend has either
already emerged or will likely emerge within the current decade13,16.
[For rainfall, only the ToEs for the first, last, and duration of Arctic
rain days were evaluated and found to occur later this century16.
Studies that evaluated Arctic ToE were sometimes based on spatial and/or
temporal averaging]{.underline} (which reduces variability and hence
results in an earlier ToE, especially in sea ice, see Supplementary
Information Figs. 1 and 2), [as such, these have mostly attributed
emergence to processes associated with Arctic sea ice
decline1]{.underline}2,16,17. For instance, a recent study suggested
that the Arctic climate has already emerged decades ago in terms of both
the seasonal minimum and maximum of SIE16, but these estimates are based
on Arctic average SIE, which due to spatial averaging of variability
yield an unrepresentative early ToE. [To date, crucial Arctic variables
such as sea ice thickness have not been analysed in terms of their first
emergence. Precipitation/rainfall exhibit strongly increasing trends,
and also considerable variability, but so far ToE has been evaluated
only for specific precipitation indices and metrics based on only two
climate models16]{.underline}. As a result, ToE-estimates are often hard
to intercompare because of differing climate variable indices and
metrics, as well as differing methodology such as, most crucially,
spatial and temporal averaging. Evidently, there is an urgent need for a
complete, reliable and internally consistent estimate of the first
emergence of the Arctic climate -- including the associated
uncertainties -- based on a broad range of state-of-the-art climate
models and five climate variables representative of the Arctic climate,
including their geographical and seasonal variations.

Results. Arctic mean time of emergence

Here we use a detailed methodology (see Methods) to robustly determine
Arctic ToE from state-of-the-art climate model simulations using 15
models in standardised scenario simulations (CMIP6, historical and
SSP5-8.5)18 to show that, [averaged over the Arctic (70°N-90°N), the
seasonal emergence of surface air temperature (TAS, 2033--2050) and sea
ice thickness (SIT, 2036--2051) will precede sea ice cover (SIC, around
2039--2074), followed by rainfall and precipitation]{.underline}
(2077--2096, 2090-after the end of the century, respectively) (Fig. 1).
In contrast to seasonal means, annual means average out seasonal
variability; hence we find that annual mean ToE-estimates precede
seasonal values by 14 ± 5 years (Fig. 1). Strong future trends result in
an earlier ToE, but a large variability -- and/or an increase in
variability -- will delay ToE (Supplementary Information Fig. 6). The
later emergence of rainfall/precipitation in spite of strong future
trends can be attributed to comparatively large past and present
variability as well as to further future increases in variability19.
[Until now, estimates of ToE for sea ice changes were based on Arctic
mean/total sea ice concentration,]{.underline} thus averaging out
spatial variability, which likely resulted in too early ToE-values (up
to 56 years compared to our best estimates, see Supplementary
Information Figs. 1 and 2). [Crucially, we find that evaluating the sea
ice cover emergence per grid point considerably delays ToE to just after
that of temperature]{.underline} (Fig. 1). [These results suggest that,
in contrast to earlier studies, the mean Arctic climate, despite
exhibiting trends that are among the largest in the world4,5,6 through
local amplifying feedbacks, has overall not yet moved significantly
outside the current state]{.underline} (although some regions and
variables have already emerged). However, ToE values exhibit
considerable intermodel differences (Supplementary Information Fig. 3),
indicative of diverging model-specific simulated Arctic trends and
variability -- interannual and/or decadal -- as well as the associated
governing processes/feedbacks20,21. This clearly indicates that analyses
of ToE should be based on as many models as possible to accurately
quantify the associated uncertainties.

TAS, SIC, and SIT are expected to transition to a new state across the
Arctic by the end of this century, with changes occurring in all seasons
(Fig. 1a-c). The earliest transitions are projected for autumn TAS,
starting as soon as 2033 (Fig. 1a). SIT generally transitions around the
same time as TAS, except for autumn, where TAS leads SIT by 13 years
(Figs. 1a-b and 2a-b). Notably, some variables and regions have already
emerged, such as SIT in the Central Arctic (Fig. 3e-h), while others,
like winter TAS over Greenland (Fig. 3a) and spring SIC in most regions
(Fig. 3j), are not expected to emerge until after 2100.

[The presence of sea ice influences the emergence of TAS particularly
during warmer seasons, such as summer and autumn, when temperatures
reach the melting point of ice. Once this point is reached, further
warming is limited until the ice fully melts, resulting in TAS and SIC
transitions occurring almost simultaneously during these
months]{.underline} (Fig. 2a, c). However[, in colder seasons, such as
winter and spring, TAS remains well below the melting point and can thus
increase freely.]{.underline} As a result, TAS transitions occur up to
24 years earlier than SIC in spring (Fig. 2a, c). This pattern is
particularly pronounced in the Central Arctic, where TAS is expected to
transition before 2050 in spring (Fig. 3b), while SIC transitions will
not occur until after 2070 or, in many areas, not even before the end of
this century (Fig. 3j). In contrast, in regions with thin sea ice, such
as the Barents Sea, the relationship between TAS and SIC is more
synchronized, with [both transitioning relatively early (Fig. 3b, j) due
to the already thin ice which suggests that surface temperatures have
already reached the melting point.]{.underline} When analyzing
individual models, we find that those with an earlier ToE in temperature
also tend to exhibit an earlier ToE in SIC (Supplementary Information
Fig. 9). This approximately linear relationship is most pronounced in
summer (R = 0.96), likely due to relatively high temperatures
efficiently melting comparatively thin sea ice.

[Sea ice cover demonstrates greater resilience than sea ice thickness,
particularly in regions dominated by multiyear thick ice]{.underline}
(Fig. 3e-l), adding complexity to the timing of their transitions. In
winter and spring, SIC transitions occur 17 and 31 years later than SIT,
respectively (Fig. 2b, c), [as reductions in ice thickness do not
immediately lead to a decline in sea ice cover in these regions. In
contrast, regions with currently relatively thin ice, e.g. the Barents
Sea, exhibit SIT transitions that often lag behind SIC by up to 20
years]{.underline} (Fig. 3e-l), marking the final state before an
ice-free state. This is especially true in regions where both variables
are concurrently near the no-ice threshold. However, SIT exhibits
greater ratio of variability and trend than SIC, especially in the
Central Arctic (Figs. 4 and 5), introducing additional complexity to its
spatiotemporal transition characteristics. This explains why, unlike
SIT, SIC undergoes significant changes only when the ice is already
thin, delaying its transition by up to 60 years compared to SIT---most
notably in the Central Arctic during winter and spring (Fig. 3e-l). This
lag is further exacerbated by the accelerated thinning of multiyear ice
due to rising atmosphere and ocean temperatures20, which promote early
SIT emergence.

### Yes Feedback Loops

**The sea ice albedo feedback and longwave radiation caused by melting
and warmer ice are accelerating the rate of shrinking ice in the
Arctic**

Technology, professor at Beijing Forestry University who does research

"Enhanced wintertime greenhouse effect reinforcing Arctic amplification
and initial sea-ice melting", Scientific Reports, 8/16/17,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08545-2)

[[The speeds of both Arctic surface warming and sea-ice shrinking have
accelerated over recent decades]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the
causes of this unprecedented phenomenon remain unclear and are subjects
of considerable debate. In this study, we report strong observational
evidence, for the first time from long-term (1984--2014) spatially
complete satellite records, that increased cloudiness and atmospheric
water vapor in winter and spring have caused an extraordinary downward
longwave radiative flux to the ice surface, which may then amplify the
Arctic wintertime ice-surface warming. In addition, [we also provide
observed evidence that it is quite likely the enhancement of the
wintertime [greenhouse effect]{.mark} caused by water vapor and
cloudiness [has advanced the time of onset of ice melting]{.mark} in
mid-May through inhibiting sea-ice refreezing in the winter and
accelerating the pre-melting process in the spring, and in turn
triggered the positive sea-ice albedo feedback process and accelerated
the sea ice melting in the summer.]{.underline}

Despite an apparent hiatus in global warming1,2,3, [the Arctic climate
continues to experience unprecedented changes. Summer sea ice is
retreating at an accelerated rate4, 5, [and surface temperatures in this
region are rising at a rate double]{.mark} that of the [global
average]{.mark}]{.underline}, a phenomenon known as Arctic
amplification6, 7. Several major competing hypotheses have been proposed
to explain the causes of Arctic amplification and summer sea-ice
retreat. For instance, an enhanced Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) transporting extraordinary amounts of heat northward
to the Arctic Ocean has been hypothesized to substantially amplify
Arctic warming and accelerate summer sea-ice melting in this
region8,9,10,11. However, evidence has instead shown significant slowing
of the AMOC over the last few decades12, 13. [Sea-ice albedo feedback
caused by the continuously shrinking summer sea ice potentially
increasing the absorption of shortwave radiation is also believed to
play a critical role in recent Arctic
amplification14]{.underline},15,16,17. But certain model simulations
have indicated that sea-ice albedo feedback was likely not the dominant
factor18, 19 - robust warming amplification still occurs in the Arctic
in the absence of albedo feedback20, 21. [Recently, downward longwave
radiation (LWD) at the surface has been suggested as an important driver
of Arctic winter warming and summer sea-ice dynamics1]{.underline}9,
22,23,24,25,26. [Because LWD is affected by several highly correlated
climatic factors, including atmospheric temperature, and the amounts of
water vapor and cloudiness27, which of these factors has been the
fundamental force driving Arctic amplification is still under debate.
Based on model simulations, several studies have claimed that
[atmospheric temperature feedback]{.mark} (also called lapse-rate
feedback at the top of the atmosphere), which is associated with
wintertime temperature inversions in the Arctic boundary layer, [is the
dominant factor]{.mark} responsible [for amplifying Arctic surface
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}18, 28. The other two greenhouse effect
factors, water vapor and cloudiness, have very limited (even negative)
effects on Arctic amplification17, 18. However, other analyses, based on
observations24, 29 and atmospheric reanalysis23, 25, have pointed in the
opposite direction and demonstrated that the cloud- and water
vapor-induced greenhouse effect is crucial to Arctic winter warming and
the development of summer sea ice. In fact, LWD is much more sensitive
to water vapor anomalies at high latitudes30,31,32,33, which suggests
that the water vapor effect in the Arctic may be considerably stronger
than that at lower latitudes. However the findings that support this
hypothesis are either from small regions23 or very short spans of time
(early winter24, 25 or late spring23, 34), and therefore are
insufficient and problematic for fully interpreting the mechanism that
drives variation in LWD at the surface and its effects on Arctic
amplification and sea-ice variations. Strong and comprehensive
additional evidence is therefore required to clarify the relationship
between LWD at the surface and Arctic amplification.

Furthermore[, because the state of sea ice at the onset of the melting
season is crucial for evaluating surface energy uptake35, 36 which
largely determines the minimum sea-ice coverage reached in the fall37,
and is asynchronous with Arctic amplification, which occurs mainly in
the wintertime6]{.underline}, 15, it is important to chronologically
investigate the causal relationships between Arctic wintertime
amplification and initial sea-ice melting to elucidate the physical
mechanisms of recent Arctic warming.

For this study, we use for the first time, long-term (1984--2014)
spatially complete satellite data to provide strong observational
evidence that [the [enhanced greenhouse effect]{.mark} from increased
atmospheric water vapor and cloudiness in both winter and spring [may
reinforce the amplification of Arctic wintertime warming]{.mark}, which
in turn has [trigger]{.mark}ed the [accelerated]{.mark} sea-ice [melting
in the summer.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Results and Analysis

[To investigate the relationships among atmospheric longwave radiative
forcing, wintertime surface warming and the late spring initial sea-ice
melting in the Arctic, we calculated long-term anomalies]{.underline} in
spatial (maximum sea-ice coverage north of 60°N) and wintertime
(including both winter and spring) temporally averaged surface downward
longwave radiative flux (LWD), water vapor (WV), cloud area fraction
(CFC), skin temperature (SKT), and sea ice concentration (SIC) for the
melting onset period37 between May 16 and June 5 (days of year 136 to
156). In addition, we identified the correlations between these
variables from records of the last 30 years (1985--2014) (Fig. 1a and b,
SIC shown here represent inverted records). The wintertime SKT of the
Arctic Ocean is strongly correlated (r = 0.95, and 0.89 after
de-trending, p \< 0.001) with the surface LWD, and both exhibit a
pronounced upward trend over the 30-year study period. Given LWD is the
main source energy at the Arctic surface in boreal wintertime and a
continually weakening AMOC12, 13 would unlikely transport extraordinary
heat northward to the Arctic, the strong coupling of surface LWD and SKT
imply that both inter-annual and long-term changes in SKT in the Arctic
have been closely associated with surface LWD over this period. Surface
LWD is related to three main parameters: temperature, clouds and water
vapor18, 28. Therefore, the high correlation coefficients between
wintertime LWD and WV over 1985--2014 (r = 0.91, and 0.82 after
de-trending, p \< 0.001), and between wintertime LWD and CFC over
2001--2014 (r = 0.93, and 0.82 after de-trending, p \< 0.001; a high
correlation was also detected for 1985--2000, Fig. S10[) imply the
likelihood that it is the enhanced greenhouse effect from water vapor
and cloudiness that caused the increase of surface LWD, and in turn
reinforced the Arctic wintertime warming over the past several decades.
I]{.underline}t is indicated that poleward moisture fluxes into the
Arctic associated with large-scale circulations significantly
contributed to the variation of precipitable water vapor in the
Arctic38, 39. We also examined the relationship between the injected
moisture across 70°N and the total precipitable water vapor in the
Arctic (Fig. S11), the strong correlation between the two variables
demonstrate that the variation of the Arctic water vapor is primarily
controlled by the transported convergence of moisture from the lower
latitude. The poleward transported moisture would bring not only water
vapor, but also latent energy into the Arctic23, 38.

[To investigate the influence of wintertime surface LWD on the state of
sea ice at the onset of melting, we directly calculated the correlation
between wintertime LWD and the melting onset SIC]{.underline} in late
spring. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, [the total wintertime surface LWD is
strongly negatively correlated with the subsequent onset
SIC]{.underline} (r = −0.90, and −0.76 after de-trending) in late
spring. Arctic sea ice usually begins to refreeze in early October and
attains its maximum coverage in early March40, 41 before entering an ice
pre-melting state until the onset of melting in mid-May40. The gradual
increase in correlation coefficients between the integrated surface LWD
and onset SIC (Fig. 1c,d, two correlation maps are also generated and
shown in Fig. S12) [demonstrates that the accumulated wintertime surface
LWD potentially influences both the ice refreezing and pre-melting
processes through reducing ice thickness25, and the perturbing of ice
thickness would in turn affects the SIC during the period of melting
onset]{.underline} (especially over these coastal regions with thin
ice)42. [After sea-ice melting begins, shortwave albedo feedback becomes
more important on driving variations in ice coverage over the subsequent
months35]{.underline}, 36. The conclusions of this study, based on
long-term observational evidence, are partially consistent with previous
studies that have reported isolated cases of atmospheric conditions
influencing ice melting in either the late spring23, 29, 34 or winter24,
25. However, our results indicate that the downward longwave radiation
from early winter to late spring is continually affecting both the
inter-annual and long-term changes of the

[Utilizing linear bilateral ODR analysis, we assessed the effects of SIC
on ULW. These two variables were negatively correlated in all seasons
and both study periods]{.underline} (Fig. 1; see Figs. S1, S3, and S4 in
the Supplement), meaning that [less SIC leads to more ULW or more SIC
leads to less ULW. The sign of the correlation was in agreement with the
theoretical expectations as the open-ocean surface in the Arctic is
usually warmer than the sea-ice surface]{.underline} (and much warmer in
the cold season from November--April) [and accordingly emits more
longwave radiation]{.underline}. As depicted in the above-mentioned
figures, the sensitivity of ULW to SIC (slope of the regression line)
did not vary considerably among reanalyses, with the highest values over
150 W m^−2^ ULW per −0.1 change in SIC in November--April in the Central
Arctic (north of 81.5° N). The dark grey areas in Figs. 1, S1, S3, and
S4 indicate a failure of the linear bilateral ODR model to converge. For
JRA-55 (panels b, f, and j in these figures), this was caused by the
binary representation of SIC in the reanalysis, which assigns a value of
1 to SIC \> 0.55 and a value of 0 to SIC ≤ 0.55. Then, because the SIC
in these dark grey areas was never less than 0.55 during the 21-year
periods, every grid cell was assigned a value of 1. Hence, no dependence
with ULW or any other variable could be found. In other reanalyses, the
ODR model failure also occurred either because of very low variability
in SIC or due to high uncertainty in the slope of regression between the
two variables (as shown in Figs. S1 and S2). In the warm season
(May--October), the effect of SIC on ULW was generally weaker, with up
to 80 W m^−2^ ULW per −0.1 change in SIC (Figs. S3 and S4).

\[Figures omitted\]

The sensitivity of ULW to SIC mostly decreased in all seasons between
1980--2000 and 2001--2021 (shades of red in panels i--l in Figs. 1, S1,
S3, and S4) but strengthened in the Central Arctic (shades of blue
panels i--l in Figs. 1, S1, S3, and S4). To explain these changes, in
Fig. 2, we show the daily values of SIC and ULW in grid cells from ERA5,
MERRA-2, and NCEP/CFSR data, where the sensitivity changed considerably
between 1980--2000 and 2001--2021 in November--December--January. While
in Point 1 (see Fig. 1), from the border of the Chukchi and East
Siberian seas, the slope of the regression line became less steep in
2001--2021 compared to 1980--2000, in Point 2, from the Central Arctic,
the slope became steeper in the second (more recent) study period.

As shown in Uhlíková et al. (2024; Fig. 5), [the surface temperature of
the Arctic sea ice (bare or snow-covered; *T*~ice~) generally increased
between the two study periods; hence, the difference
between *T*~ice~ and the sea surface temperature decreased, causing
lower sensitivity of ULW to SIC in the majority of the Arctic in all
seasons]{.underline} in the second study period. Also in this study, we
show in Point 1 of Fig. 2 that ULW (and therefore the surface
temperature) is generally higher in 2001--2021 (lower panels) than
1980--2000 (upper panels) in days with SIC = 1. Another cause of
decreasing sensitivity of ULW to SIC is the fact that in areas where the
SIC declined or disappeared completely between the two study periods,
there is naturally a smaller effect or no effect of SIC on ULW in the
second study period. [ULW is also generally not so sensitive to SIC in
regions where SIC is low because, in such regions, *T*~ice~ is typically
higher and closer to the sea surface temperature.]{.underline} This is
illustrated in the lower panels of Point 1 of Fig. 2, where all the
values of ULW in the grid cells with SIC lower than approximately 0.5
fluctuate close to 300 W m^−2^.

The increased sensitivity of ULW to SIC in smaller areas in the Central
Arctic may be due to increased SIC in reanalyses in these areas in
2001--2021 compared to 1980--2000. As shown in Point 2 of Fig. 2, there
is indeed higher SIC, as well as steeper slopes of the regression lines
in the second study period (lower panels), than in the first one (upper
panels). We discuss the possible mechanisms of the increased SIC in
Sect. 4.1.

To further explore the effect of the surface type in the marine Arctic
on ULW, we investigated whether the main driver of ULW is the SIC
or *T*~ice~. To answer this question, we compared *R*^2^ (coefficient of
determination) using SIC and *T*~ice~ as explanatory variables for ULW.
To calculate *T*~ice~ from the grid-averaged surface temperature
(*T*~s~), we utilized the following equation:

where we assumed the temperature of the ocean (*T*~ocean~) at −1.8 °C
(271.35 K). This assumption cannot be applied in the warm season
(May--October) in the majority of adjacent seas outside the Central
Arctic because the surface temperature of the ocean is likely often
higher than −1.8 °C. Hence, we focused on the cold season
(November--April) in these analyses. We are also aware that in the
Greenland and Barents seas, even cold-season ocean temperature may be
warmer than −1.8 °C due to the North Atlantic Current carrying warm
Atlantic water to this area. We utilized data from only ERA5, MERRA-2,
and NCEP/CFSR because JRA-55 comes with binary representation of SIC;
hence, Eq. (2) is not applicable for this data set. As shown in Figs. 3
and S5, in November--April, [*T*~ice~ explained over 90 % of the
variance of ULW in areas, where SIC is very high, whereas SIC explained
only around 30 % of the variance in ULW in these areas.]{.underline}
However, in the marginal ice zone, the coefficient of determination was
higher for SIC (around 60 %) compared to *T*~ice~ (\< 30 %). These
results were quantitatively very similar in both study periods, and we
found very good agreement between the three reanalyses. \[Figure
omitted\]

[In addition to SIC, sea-ice thickness and snow depth on top of sea ice
affect the surface temperature and, hence, the upward longwave
radiation.]{.underline} Due to the limited amount and accuracy of data
on sea-ice thickness and snow depth in the Arctic Ocean, we estimate
their effect on ULW via analytic calculations, analogous to those
in Uhlíková et al. (2024). We focus on the cold season when the
insulating effects of ice and snow are largest. As a first
approximation, we assume that the temperature profile through ice and
snow is piecewise linear, resulting in the following expression for the
conductive heat flux *C* (Makshtas, 1991):

where *k*~i~ stands for the heat conductivity of ice, *T*~s~ for the ice
surface temperature, *T*~b~ for the ice bottom temperature, *h*~i~ for
the ice thickness, *k*~s~ for the heat conductivity of snow, and *h*~s~
for snow thickness. We used −1.8 °C for *T*~b~, 2.1 W m^−1^ K^−1^ for
*k*~i~, and 0.3 W m^−1^ K^−1^ for *k*~s~. The turbulent fluxes of latent
and sensible heat (LHF and SHF) were calculated by applying the
following standard bulk formulae:

where *ρ* stands for the air density, *LE* for the latent heat of
sublimation, *c*~p~ for the specific heat of the air, and *C*~HE~ for
the turbulent exchange coefficient. (*Q*~a~−*Q*~s~) and (*T*~a~−*T*~s~)
are the differences in the specific humidity and temperature between the
lowest atmospheric level and the surface, and *V* stands for the wind
speed at the lowest atmospheric level of the model applied in each
reanalysis. The upward longwave radiation (ULW) was calculated as
follows:

where *σ* stands for the Stefan--Boltzmann constant ( W m^−2^ K^−4^). As
in Uhlíková et al. (2024), the downward longwave radiation (DLW) and the
input for Eqs. (3) to (6) were taken from observations from the SHEBA
campaign in the Central Arctic in February 1998 (Persson et al., 2002)
when the mean values were as follows: 155 W m^−2^ for DLW, 5.0 m s^−1^
for *V*, −32 °C for *T*~a~, and 0.9 for the relative humidity, yielding
0.17 g kg^−1^ for *Q*~a~. Then Eqs. (3) to (6) were solved by applying
the following values of *h*~i~: 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 m,
with *h*~s~ systematically set as 0.1 × *h*~i~. As *T*~s~ is unknown,
and all the fluxes except DLW depend on it, a set of calculations with
various *T*~s~ values was carried out for each combination of *h*~i~ and
*h*~s~ until the *T*~s~ yielded a zero net heat flux (DLW − ULW + SHF +
LHF + *C*) at the snow surface to represent equilibrium conditions.

[The sensitivity of *T*~s~, *C*, and ULW to snow and ice thickness is
presented in Fig. 4. In the case of thin ice, the snow surface
temperature is highly sensitive to ice thickness, but the sensitivity
decreases when the ice gets thicker]{.underline} (Fig. 4a). This is
reflected in ULW. For 0.2 m ice thickness (0.02 m snow depth), ULW is
227 W m^−2^, whereas for 3 m ice thickness (0.3 m snow depth) ULW is
183 W m^−2^, representing a difference of −44 W m^−2^. The difference in
ULW between ice thicknesses of 2 and 3 m is minor (−2 W m^−2^), as the
conductive heat flux through ice and snow is small already for 2 m thick
ice (covered by 0.2 m snowpack). A comparison of Figs. 4 and S1 shows
that in winter in the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Barents
Sea, [ULW is approximately equally sensitive to a decrease in ice
thickness from 3 to 0.2 m and to a decrease in SIC by 0.1. However,
closer to the central Arctic Ocean and in the Canadian Arctic
archipelago, the sensitivity is higher for a decrease in
SIC]{.underline} by 0.1. These high statistical sensitivities to SIC may
be partly due to co-occurrence of low SIC and high ice surface
temperatures.

#### Arctic Infrastructure Development Fund solves. 

**Cole 20**, Dermot Cole holds a journalism degree from the University
of Alaska Fairbanks and is an independent political reporter and
columnist based in Alaska, December 19 2020, "Alaska politicians may try
to use AIDEA to invest in ANWR tracts," Reporting from Alaska,

**[[A state-owned agency]{.mark} that endeavors to keep as many secrets
as possible has [just scheduled a secret session]{.mark}]{.underline}**
for Dec. 23 **[[to discuss "confidential matters related to]{.mark} a
potential new project for [the Arctic Infrastructure Development
Fund]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[This is to be followed by a resolution "for the funding of the Arctic
Infrastructure Development Funding."]{.underline}**

While that phrase makes no sense at all, we are left to guess about what
might be happening because the resolution has not been made public.

My guess is that AIDEA wants to meet in secret to talk about bidding on
tracts in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an idea floated by former
Govs. Frank Murkowski and Bill Walker.

Perhaps that's the wrong guess. Maybe AIDEA wants to invest in plans by
Santa Claus to amp up toy production infrastructure at the North Pole or
expand the flying reindeer market.

**[The timing of this meeting]{.underline}**, revealed in a public
notice posted at the close of business Friday, [**makes** **me think
that [timing is a big factor]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Jan. 6 ANWR
lease sale, unless stopped by the courts, requires bids be made before
the end of the month.

**[AIDEA is owned by the state, so Alaskans deserve to be part of the
debate]{.underline}**, even if it takes place on the afternoon of Dec.
23. And we shouldn't be forced to guess about what AIDEA is doing with
our money.

**[[The AIDEA Arctic Infrastructure Fund had \$35
million]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as of this June 30 audit.

**[Gov. Mike Dunleavy can't bid on ANWR tracts without a legislative
appropriation, but the AIDEA board might claim that it's a good
investment to tie up millions for a prolonged battle with the Biden
administration.]{.underline}**

**[[The]{.mark} AIDEA [board consists of people who would think that
using state money]{.mark} to bid on tracts in ANWR [is]{.mark} a
[tremendous]{.mark} idea.]{.underline}** There are two state
employees---Commerce Commissioner Julie Anderson, former Sen. Anna
MacKinnon, along with Dana Pruhs, Julie Sande, Bernie Karl, Albert Fogle
and Bill Kendig.

If all seven of them agree to risk their own fortunes in this endeavor,
they'd have an easier time making the case that this is a sound business
proposition.

**[The logic for having the state invest in ANWR is that [since]{.mark}
the [oil companies may not do it, it makes perfect sense for the state
to get involved]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This turns 40 years of political
babbling about the ANWR bonanza on its head. Instead of getting 90
percent of the lease sale money or even 50 percent, the state would get
nothing.

[**The oil industry hasn't been clamoring for an ANWR lease sale, which
is probably why the Trump administration delayed it so long that it has
become legally vulnerable**.]{.underline} There is a possibility the
courts will delay the Jan. 6 sale, which would be tantamount to killing
it.

**["So far, there has been no indication from the producers of an intent
to bid on the tracts,"]{.underline}** Murkowski wrote in a newspaper
column calling for state bids instead of private bids.

Walker wrote that [**[the state "should submit a minimum bid on every
tract]{.mark} put up for lease, not to compete with other bidders, but
[to ensure Alaska is at the table]{.mark} in the event there are few to
no bids submitted**.]{.underline} This would assure that the leases
would then be under state or private control and the state would be
positioned to transfer its holdings to private control in the future."

**["[Trading investment dollars]{.mark} for developing valuable revenue
producing leases, which when operational [could generate a handsome
return to the investors]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Murkowski said of his
plan. But the oil industry doesn't see it that way, which means that
this may not be as good an investment as the proposed road to Mars that
Mike Doogan once wrote about.

To push the state's claim to ANWR leases, the Dunleavy administration
may turn to its version of an elite strike force---the plan to spend \$4
million hiring lawyers for "Outside counsel and expertise for statehood
defense" and to "develop and protect the state's natural resources . .
."

Considering that \$500,000 has been wasted so far in hiring Trump's
lawyer on losing a simple case, **[Dunleavy will have to ask the
Legislature for a lot more than \$4 million to push the ANWR battles
ahead.]{.underline}**

But remember, I'm just guessing because these are state secrets.

The first explorers known to have reached the North Pole spent weeks
dragging their sleds across the rough pack ice. Now, people can travel
most of the way there from the comfort of a cruise ship, their passage
eased by the catastrophic melting of ice caused by climate change. [[The
Arctic]{.mark} is shedding ice at a rate of 12 per cent per decade and
[is set to be ice-free]{.mark} in the summer [by]{.mark} the
[2030]{.mark}s]{.underline} -- **[[regardless of how fast we cut
emissions from now on]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Meanwhile, in Antarctica,
the vast Thwaites glacier is cracking under the pressure of global
warming, and Antarctic sea ice has been tracking at record lows in 2024
for the second year running. We must [[cut
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, and fast, but that alone [[won't be
enough]{.mark} to stop the runaway melt in the Arctic.]{.underline} [To
buy us time]{.underline} and to buttress this delicate habitat from a
warming world, [[geoengineering is]{.mark} probably [our only
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}. One solution comes from start-up Real Ice,
which plans to use seawater to thicken the Arctic's ice. It is
controversial. Geoengineering of this sort, opponents argue, risks
distracting humanity from the gargantuan task of cutting emissions. Yet
there are good reasons to push ahead. Alongside the spectacular wildlife
and rich cultural heritage there, [the polar regions do the world a huge
favour. Their white caps reflect solar radiation back into space,
helping to keep Earth's climate cool. The [loss of Arctic]{.mark} sea
[ice]{.mark} also triggers a whole host of other feedbacks that [would
amplify climate change]{.mark} and play havoc with weather systems
around the world.]{.underline} Of all our geoengineering options,
refreezing the poles is perhaps the most benign. There are, of course,
risks. Thorough impact assessments will be vital to minimise any harmful
effects on wildlife, local communities or wider Earth systems. But
[[without action,]{.mark} the [ice will disappear, destabilising the

### Climate Outwieghs geoengineering impacts

#### Any risks of solar geoengineering are outweighed by climate change -- accelerated warming makes the Earth uninhabitable

As a climate scientist working on solar geoengineering, I was struck by
Raymond Pierrehumbert and Michael Mann's call to defund the UK's
Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) research programme (The
UK's gamble on solar geoengineering is like using aspirin for cancer, 12
March). [Given current emission projections, it is likely that the world
will reach 2C of warming]{.underline}. [The [only]{.mark} potential
[tool]{.mark} we have [to reduce temperatures]{.mark} on a short
timescale [is solar geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is necessary
to reduce emissions, but once we reach net zero, global temperatures
only stabilise, and the melting of glaciers and sea level rise will
continue. While it is possible to remove carbon from the atmosphere, it
remains slow and expensive for now. Solar geoengineering research is
important because it is possible that the climate will react more
strongly to greenhouse gases than expected, and even 2C of warming might
have devastating impacts. [It is [undeniable that]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} physical
and political [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, and I share many of the
concerns the authors raise. [[However, a warmer world]{.mark} that
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly **[[become

risks]{.mark} [of]{.mark} solar [geoengineering must be balanced with
the risks from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}
that would be attenuated. [Climate model evidence suggests that some

Beyond the destruction of the SRM deployment infrastructure,
[termination could be forced if a large catastrophe]{.underline} (such
as a natural disaster, an economic collapse, or a war) [were to
interrupt the economic or political ability to maintain an SRM
program]{.underline}. Figure 2 outlines this pathway. First, the
deployer(s) would have to suffer an event that destroyed their economic
and/or political capacity to maintain SRM. Second, there would need to
be no other actors capable of redeploying before temperatures rose
rapidly. If neither the original deployer nor any other party were
capable of redeploying an SRM system in the months after a catastrophe,
then termination shock would occur. The same measures that would
increase the resilience of SRM against terrorist attacks would also
increase resilience against disasters that were local or regional in
scope. If spare deployment capacity were maintained or numerous nations
were capable of deployment, then the SRM system would be resilient
against catastrophes that were confined to one country or one region.
Not all catastrophes are regional though, and various [[global
calamities]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as nuclear war, a global pandemic,
or an economic collapse) [have [been suggested]{.mark} [as]{.mark}
possible [drivers of termination]{.mark}]{.underline} (Barrett, 2014;
Hamilton, 2013; Olson, 2011). Amidst a true global catastrophe, one that
destroyed the capacity of all competent actors to maintain deployment,
backup delivery equipment would not help. While there should be no doubt
that a global catastrophe could destroy global capacity to maintain SRM,
[it is [worth noting]{.mark}]{.underline} quite [[how
destructive]{.mark} such [an event would have to
be]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, [[consider how large the economic
damage would have to be before maintaining SRM became
unaffordable]{.mark}.]{.underline} If nations were to cooperate to
maintain SRM---a proposition that we find reasonable given the projected
damages of termination shock---then [[global]{.mark} [g]{.mark}ross
[d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct]{.underline} (GDP)
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[need to drop]{.mark} by [over
90%]{.mark}]{.underline} before maintaining SRM would cost more than 1%
of the collective postcatastrophe GDP of the world\'s top 20 economies.
1 [Even assuming no international cooperation, the catastrophe would
still have to be colossal to force SRM termination based on economic
factors]{.underline}. [[Even if a disaster wiped off 70% of
their]{.mark} [GDP]{.mark}s]{.underline}, China or [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates alone [could]{.mark} still [deploy]{.mark} [SRM for less
than 1% of their postcatastrophe GDPs]{.mark}]{.underline} (IMF, 2014).
[To put these figures in context, arguably the greatest international
calamities of the last century, World War I and Spanish influenza
combined, the Great Depression, and World War II caused GDP in Europe to
fall by 13%, 8%, and 21%, respectively]{.underline} (The
Maddison-Project, 2013). Therefore, if spare deployment capacity were
maintained, or could be brought online quickly, [a [catastrophe would
have to be on a scale unprecedented]{.mark} in modern history [to force
termination shock]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such events are not
inconceivable though, and an asteroid strike, global nuclear war, or
catastrophic pandemic could force an end to SRM even where there was a
desire to maintain it. In this instance, few policies could prevent
termination. We reflect on this possibility in Section 4.3.

[.]{.underline} However, climate models contain many uncertainties that
well‑governed, small-scale outdoor experiments may enable us to reduce.
While more research and higher‑quality information on solar
geoengineering are not sufficient to guarantee good decision-making
about it in the future, they are certainly a prerequisite. I welcome the
UK government's investment in solar geoengineering research.

### AT International Law Turn -- AT Link

#### International law does not prohibit the deployment of SRM

Josh **Horton**, 11/26/**24**, SRM360, \[Josh is a Senior Program
Fellow, Solar Geoengineering, at Harvard Kennedy School, and conducts
wide-ranging research on the national and international governance of
SRM research and potential deployment.\], "Does International Law
Prohibit SRM?"
https://srm360.org/article/does-international-law-prohibit-srm/, mm

SRM interventions -- if they were undertaken -- would affect the global
climate system, and thus every country on Earth. Since some effects of
SRM could be harmful, the question arises: [does international law
prohibit SRM]{.underline} research, field experiments, or
[deployment?]{.underline} Simply put, international law is law among
states. [There are]{.underline} [two]{.underline} main [types of binding
international law: customary]{.underline} international [law and treaty
law]{.underline}. Customary international law consists of legal
obligations among all states that derive from practice. For example,
according to the customary "no-harm rule", states have duties to
minimise or at least reduce significant environmental harms to other
states. They also have obligations to conduct environmental impact
assessments where appropriate. While customary international law is
binding on all states, it lacks detail and can be open to
interpretation. [Most legal scholars find no evidence to suggest that
customary international law categorically prohibits SRM]{.underline}.1
Treaty law, as its name suggests, consists of legal obligations arising
from treaties signed and ratified by states. Unlike customary
international law, [treaty law is binding only on those states that have
ratified it]{.underline}.2 [The United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change]{.underline} is the principal treaty governing climate
change and the framework within which the Paris Agreement was developed,
but it [does not address SRM]{.underline} specifically.3 Instead, SRM
has been addressed in piecemeal fashion by a handful of other treaties
related to the environment. The table below summarises this patchwork
coverage. In 2010, [states party to the Convention on Biological
Diversity]{.underline} (CBD), which aims to protect global biodiversity,
[adopted a decision urging countries to prevent "climate-related
geo-engineering]{.underline} activities \[including SRM\] that may
affect biodiversity" -- with the exception of "small scale scientific
research studies" -- until there is adequate scientific justification
and appropriate consideration of risks and impacts.4 Some people refer
to this decision as an international "moratorium". But [since it is a
decision rather than an amendment, it is not legally
binding]{.underline} -- even on states that have ratified the CBD.5
[Furthermore, the]{.underline} United States [(US) is not a party to the
CBD]{.underline}. Regardless, most informed commentators reject the
notion that the CBD prohibits SRM because its parties are under no
obligation to do so.6 The London Convention and London Protocol regulate
ocean dumping.7 In 2013, negotiators finalised an amendment to the
London Protocol that would prohibit specific listed "marine
geoengineering" activities with a possible exception for "legitimate
scientific research".8 As written, this amendment would apply only to
ocean fertilisation, which aims to capture carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere by stimulating phytoplankton blooms. However, [states that
have ratified the London Protocol are currently considering whether to
list marine cloud brightening as a form of marine
geoengineering]{.underline} under the terms of the amendment. [Yet this
2013 amendment has not entered into force]{.underline} -- only 6 of a
required 36 countries have ratified it. And if it ever did enter into
force and consequently became legally binding, the amendment does not
currently address SRM. [Further]{.underline}, as in the case of the CBD,
[the US is not a party to the London Protocol.]{.underline} Again, as
with the CBD, legal scholars acknowledge that the London Protocol does
not prohibit SRM.9 The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any
Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, or
[ENMOD]{.underline}, was signed in 1977. The treaty
[prohibits]{.underline} [the "hostile" use of environmental modification
techniques,]{.underline} and such techniques would clearly include SRM.
[Suggested uses of SRM, however, seem unlikely to be hostile in
character]{.underline}.10 Moreover, SRM does not appear to be capable of
being weaponised. In any case, [ENMOD is an inactive treaty -- its
parties have not met since 1992 and have no plans to do so]{.underline}.
While it might seem that international law ought to prohibit the use of
SRM, neither customary international law nor any treaty does so. Some
indications of at least limited support for banning SRM should be noted.
Following unauthorised balloon releases carried out in Mexico by the US
start-up company "Make Sunsets" in 2022, the Mexican government
announced its intention to prohibit SRM and rally other countries to
take similar steps.11 And at a meeting of the United Nations Environment
Assembly in 2024, African countries pushed for the "non-use" of SRM, but
were unsuccessful due to lack of support. While support for prohibiting
the use of SRM may grow in the future, for now, [international law poses
no strong barriers to SRM.]{.underline}

### Plan Is Bipartisan

#### Solar geoengineering will be bipartisan -- it can generate a coalition between pragmatic Democrats and corporatist Republicans

commercial lawyer and postgraduate student at King's College London),

mm

SG=SRM

Although public awareness of SG within the US is currently low [two
factors may complicate this model of climate polarisation]{.underline}.
Firstly, "[[left/right" polarisation may be less important in
determining views on SG]{.underline}]{.mark} than a divide between
"Prometheans" confident of humanity's ability to control nature and
"Soterians" who are instinctively suspicious of "unnatural technological
solutions and the hubris of mastery projects". In this political
environment, conservative Republicans doubtful of mankind's contribution
towards climate change may form an unlikely coalition with environmental
activists who view SG as a dangerous distraction from climate change
mitigation. Conversely, [pragmatic [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [eager to
"buy time" for]{.mark} long-term [climate solutions]{.mark} may align
with corporatist [Repub]{.mark}lican[s]{.mark} who [see]{.mark} in [SG
an opportunity to maintain existing economic
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, a [coalition in support of MCB
deployment could include such diverse voices as former Republican House
Speaker Newt Gingrich]{.underline}, who made the conservative case for
SG deployment in 2008, [and]{.underline} Democratic President [Joe
Biden,]{.underline} who authorized a report on SG in 2022. [It is
therefore possible that the [politics of SG may transcend]{.mark}
traditional [political polarisation, enabling a wider]{.mark} potential
[coalition of support for]{.mark} MCB [deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB) solves

#### MCB is logistically feasible and would break the positive feedback loop of warming in the Arctic

Andrew **Anthony**, 11/27/**22**, The Guardian, "Melting point: could
'cloud brightening' slow the thawing of the Arctic?"
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic,
mm

Like the apocryphal frog that doesn't notice the rising water
temperature until it's boiled alive, we as a global society are still
struggling to recognise that anthropic [global warming is hastening us
towards irreversible environmental and ecological
catastrophe.]{.underline} [While there is consensus among climate
scientists about the urgency of the situation]{.underline}, and
widespread political acknowledgment that the use of carbon fuels must be
reduced, [targets have not been met]{.underline} and as the UK's Cop26
president, Alok Sharma, said, [the [lack of
progress]{.mark}]{.underline} at this month's Cop27 [[demonstrates the
1.5C limit is on "life support"]{.mark} and there is [growing
ev]{.mark}idence that [we]{.mark} [are further along the road to a
tipping point]{.mark} than previously thought]{.underline}. So advanced
is this process that some [scientists are beginning to argue that merely
cutting carbon is not enough and [an emergency measure involving]{.mark}
what is known as [geoengineering is called for]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There have been a number of plans suggested, some more outlandish than
others. They range from building giant mirrors in space to reflect away
sunlight to painting the roofs of buildings white to help counteract
heatwaves in cities. [One]{.underline} particular [[area of concern is
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which]{.underline}, according to the
latest research by Norwegian scientists, [is warming at four times the
speed of the rest of the planet]{.underline}. [[The more it warms, the
more ice cover it loses]{.mark}, which in turn leads to further heating,
[creating a]{.mark} so-called positive [feedback
loop]{.mark}]{.underline} (although, paradoxically, the effect is
entirely negative). Two [suggestions for
[geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} the poles' climate [have [drawn
serious attention]{.mark} and have been the subject of theoretical
modelling]{.underline}. The most popular and perhaps advanced of these
is what is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, in which sulphur
dioxide would be released into the stratosphere to gather around the
poles. The idea is that the aerosols will have a similar effect to the
ash clouds from volcanoes, which reach a high altitude and reflect
sunlight, bringing down temperatures on Earth. There are many critics of
the proposal, who point out that sulphur dioxide, which is associated
with acid rain, asthma and chronic bronchitis, is itself environmentally
damaging and there is no guarantee that its effects would be limited to
the poles or, indeed, what its long-term effects might be. There has
been some very limited field work examining aerosol effects, but it has
been too restricted to offer any definitive answers. As Ben Kravitz,
atmospheric scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, says:
"It's difficult for me to say whether I'm for or against stratospheric
aerosol injection because it's hard for me to even understand what I'm
giving an opinion on. The effects will vary depending on how much
aerosol injection is done, where, when and what material is used. And
then we need to translate effects (such as changes in temperature,
precipitation, etc) into impacts (such as food and water security). And
then all of that needs to be compared to what would happen under climate
change without stratospheric aerosol injection. So it's too hard for me
to say whether geoengineering is a good or bad idea at this stage."
Aside from the inherent uncertainty in the proposal, there is also
concern about the politics of geoengineering, particularly in relation
to indigenous people in the Arctic region, with one group of scientists
arguing that "solar geoengineering at planetary scale is not governable
in a globally inclusive and just manner within the current international
political system". A recent study led by Wake Smith, a lecturer at Yale
University on venture capital and private equity, looked at the
financial and logistical implications of aerosol injection deployment.
The cost was estimated to be \$11bn a year -- no small sum, but a tiny
fraction of the costs of dealing with damage done by climate change. The
study suggested that 175,000 flights a year would be needed to release a
cloud of microscopic sulphur dioxide particles at an altitude of
43,000ft and latitude of 60 degrees in each hemisphere. Such a massive
air mobilisation would in turn release millions of tonnes of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere, but it would also lead, say the models, to
a 2C drop in temperature at the polar regions. Smith acknowledges that
it's a temporary measure that treats the symptoms rather than the
underlying disease. "It's aspirin, not penicillin," he's said. "It's not
a substitute for decarbonisation." In theory, the sulphur dioxide
particles would settle over the poles, but in practice, no one can be
sure. It's one of the reasons that cloud brightening has been suggested
as a less risky and more viable option. Sir David King is the founder of
[the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge]{.underline} (CCRC). A
multidisciplinary team, it has three main objectives: to reduce CO2
emissions, remove excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and to
refreeze damaged parts of the climate system. The CCRC [is backing
research into cloud brightening]{.underline}, which King insists is not
geoengineering. "We reserve the phrase geoengineering for putting
sulphates into the stratosphere," he explains. While he is in favour of
small-scale experiments with sulphates, he believes there should be a
moratorium on "at scale" use of them in the stratosphere.
[[M]{.mark}arine [c]{.mark}loud [b]{.mark}rightening]{.underline}, by
contrast, he says [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not geoengineering but
"[[biomimicry]{.underline}]{.mark}", a means of imitating a natural
process on a huge scale. [The science is straightforward in
theory]{.underline}. [[Clouds]{.mark} formed [over oceans tend to build
around salt crystals]{.mark} left after droplets of sea spray evaporate.
Salt crystals vary in size and if they are at the smaller end of the
spectrum, then clouds are formed of lots of small droplets. [Clouds made
from smaller droplets appear whiter]{.mark} than **[those]{.mark}**
composed [of]{.mark} [larger droplets and]{.mark} as a result [reflect
more sunlight]{.mark},]{.underline} even if they carry the same amount
of water. [The [idea is to whiten clouds by creating sea spray
with]{.mark} a flotilla [of boats armed with pumps and
nozzles]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Once it's all been proved operative and
functional and there's no deleterious effects," says King, "[we would
need to have 500 to 1,000 ocean-going vessels placed around the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}."

### Alaska has the money to do the plan

#### The fund has [billions in the bank]{.underline}, even for infrastructure alone, and invests in [massive amounts of infrastructure now]{.underline} and it [generates revenue]{.underline} for the fund over the long term.

**APFC \'22**, Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, \"Infrastructure,
Changing the Definition,\" 12-14-2022,
https://apfc.org/fund-news/infrastructure-changing-the-definition/,
Accessed 6-29-2025 by NT-MP

Changing the definition

**[[Investments in infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [backbone
of]{.underline} those things [societies]{.underline} depend on every
day, have [[proven]{.mark} their ability to [generate consistent
revenues over]{.mark} the **[long term]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since
2007, APFC has been investing in infrastructure assets in the United
States and internationally. The definition of
[infrastructure]{.underline} itself has continued to expand and evolve
over the years. The asset class used to primarily [[consist of
**utilities**, **transportation**]{.mark} assets, **[waste]{.mark}**,
and **[water]{.mark}** systems]{.underline}. Today, the asset class
includes [[telecommunications]{.mark} infrastructure such as **[cellular
towers]{.mark}**, **[fiber optic]{.mark}** networks, and **[data
centers]{.mark}**; **[renewable electricity]{.mark}** generation,
[**energy storage**, and **social infrastructure**]{.mark} such
[as]{.mark} specialty [healthcare facilities]{.mark}. Investments in
assets]{.underline} that were once considered risky, [like
telecommunications assets or renewable power generation, are now quite
common.]{.underline}

With this change in mindset, investment management organizations like
**[[APFC]{.underline}]{.mark}** have seen these [assets gradually [shift
from]{.mark} higher-risk [private equity]{.mark} portfolios
[into]{.mark} their **[infrastructure portfolios.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
With its agile structure and flexibility, [APFC is able to [identify
interesting opportunities]{.mark} and support [expanding]{.mark}
**[infrastructure investments]{.mark}**. By making long-term investments
in infrastructure, APFC is also able to [provide **consistent
returns**]{.mark} and diversification [to]{.mark} the total **[Permanent
Fund]{.mark}** portfolio.]{.underline}

"What's been exciting and where I think we've really been able to [add
value is our ability to think creatively and act quickly]{.underline}."
Says [Ross Alexander, APFC's Infrastructure Portfolio]{.underline}
[manager]{.underline}. "I think the flexibility of our capital has been
beneficial, allowing us to look at different types of assets and
structures that others may pass up."

Engineered for returns and diversification

Ever since the portfolio was established, the objective has been to find
assets that are resilient through economic cycles, and have defensive
characteristics, such as assets that are considered essential services
and have contracted or highly predictable cash flows. APFC's approach
for managing an infrastructure portfolio is similar to one for private
equity. Through active ownership, investment returns are generated more
from capital appreciation than recurring cash flows or consistent income
distributions, as expected with core Real Estate or Fixed Income
investments.

Generally, [diversification can lower a portfolio's risk, and it's no
different with infrastructure. Approximately **[40%]{.mark}** of [APFC's
infrastructure portfolio is invested in **North
America**]{.mark}]{.underline}, 40% is invested in the UK and Europe,
and the remaining 20% is split between Latin America, Asia, and other
emerging markets. Much of the emerging markets' exposure is in digital
infrastructure or power generation, such as developing solar and wind
farms, providing a reliable source of electricity where there often
wasn't before.

[With a [value of]{.mark} **more than [\$3 billion]{.mark}**, **[APFC's
Infrastructure Portfolio]{.mark}** has grown [big enough to invest
alongside]{.mark} the [**most significant funds** in]{.mark} the
[world]{.mark} yet remains nimble enough to continue working with
smaller partners that bring their own unique opportunities]{.underline}.
APFC leverages outside consultants as well, to enable management of the
entire infrastructure portfolio with a small team.

How does APFC participate?

APFC's Infrastructure portfolio is approximately 90% invested in private
companies, often through commingled funds where external managers raise
pools of capital from institutional investors such as pension funds,
endowments, and sovereign wealth funds. As a long-term source of
capital, the Permanent Fund's structure and return objectives work well
with the longer time horizon of these private investments. The longer
time horizon of private investments also allows fund managers to think
differently about the company, assessing what can be done over the years
of ownership to make it more efficient, reduce costs, or expand
operations to make it more valuable. The remaining 10% of the portfolio
is invested in publicly traded companies which often strive to achieve
shorter-term results.

Over the 10-year investment lifespan of a typical closed-end
infrastructure fund, the first 3-5 years are defined as the investment
period, where APFC and other limited partners provide capital as needed
to acquire or create businesses or assets. During years 6-10, the
investment manager works to improve or expand operations and then looks
to exit the investment.

For the long-term

"[APFC's [infrastructure investments]{.mark} exhibit investment
characteristics that are [additive]{.mark} and complementary [to]{.mark}
the [Fund's other asset]{.mark} classes." Says Marcus Frampton, APFC
Chief Investment Officer]{.underline}, "Specifically, [[if global
economies]{.mark} have [entered]{.mark} a **[higher inflation]{.mark}**
regime, as many economists expect, [APFC's infrastructure]{.mark} assets
could [provide attractive **real returns**]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Frampton goes on to say that conversely, "[In a more
**[recessionary]{.mark}** scenario, the [critical nature of]{.mark}
these [assets]{.mark} should [result in **defensive attributes**]{.mark}
to the investment profile."]{.underline}

Because of the unique characteristics of [[infrastructure]{.mark}
assets, many investments have seen limited impacts or even
[outperformed]{.mark} despite the current **[inflation]{.mark}**ary
environment]{.underline}. These returns highlight the portfolio's
ability to offer inflation protection and mitigation of downside risks
to the Permanent Fund.

As the needs of our societies continue to change, the definition of
infrastructure will also continue to evolve. [[APFC remains]{.mark}
active in making [new **infrastructure commitments** across asset
types]{.mark}, geographies, and structures with a focus on
diversification and maximizing risk-adjusted returns over a long
horizon. APFC will continue to [seek]{.mark} and identify interesting
[infrastructure investment]{.mark} [opportunities]{.mark} to grow and

Alaskans.]{.underline}

#### Investing infrastructure is a [highly reliable revenue generator]{.underline} and the Permanent Fund has over \$[80 billion]{.underline} that they could [invest in infrastructure]{.underline}.

Zak **Bentley \'25**, Americas Editor at Infrastructure Investor based
in New York. Zak joined Infrastructure Investor in 2016 from Centaur
where he was a reporter at their Clean Energy Pipeline title, \"Alaska
Permanent's infra portfolio is ready for a recession,\" Infrastructure

When asked if he was worried about a recession, President Donald Trump
recently responded with a firm "no". [Over at the **[\$80.8
billion]{.mark}** **[A]{.mark}**laska **[P]{.mark}**ermanent
**[F]{.mark}**und, senior portfolio manager for private income Ross
Alexander may be more concerned about the US entering a recession, but
believes the [portfolio covering **infrastructure**]{.mark} and private
credit is more than well-equipped to weather it.]{.underline}

In its 2024 annual report released in September, the Alaskan sovereign
fund said that for several years it had "taken a cautious approach,
defensively deploying capital to withstand an expected market downturn"
within the private income portfolio. This means, Alexander said,
examining whether the portfolio can go beyond passing costs through to
end users.

"For a while now, we've had a bit of a pessimistic view about where the
economy's going and that we're more likely to see a recession than not,
and we've long had that view more or less since covid," Alexander told
Infrastructure Investor. "Things didn't really feel like we were back to
risk on, even when it started to look like we were getting there. If a
recession is likely, now let's understand what happens to demand for
these businesses and assets."

From a [portfolio construction point of view, this means ensuring [focus
on]{.mark} traditional [**infrastructure assets** and]{.mark} the
long-term contracts and [**stable cashflows**]{.mark} wrapped [around
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"It's about ensuring that we're not priced to perfection and that
everything has to go well. We're not shifting where we're allocating;
it's about recognising there's going to be bumps in the road, and let's
make sure we can make money in all of it and that our businesses still
exist and still have value, even in a recessionary environment,"
Alexander explained.

"We've seen some more traditional assets recently, such as managed
lanes. Those have some interesting characteristics that we really like.
If we can partner with the right group on those, we really like them."

[With infrastructure comprising 58 percent of the fund's \$6.7 billion
in private income bucket]{.underline}, co-investments have become a key
part of the strategy. Alexander said these comprise just under 20
percent of the portfolio, with an aim to grow this to 25-35 percent over
the long term. However, he did highlight co-investments, rather than
fundraising, as one particular segment taking stock amid market
turbulence.

"Co-investments have slowed down a little bit. Things that were in
process at the end of last year -- some of those are getting repriced,
depending on the sector and the market. It's not consistent across the
board, just depends on the type of co-investment," Alexnader maintained.

"It's just general uncertainty. Buyers are a bit more cautious and
sellers are not willing to re-mark."

Eyes on the mid-market

Historically, Alaska Permanent has committed to several of the large-cap
managers, such as Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of BlackRock,
Stonepeak, KKR and EQT. While some have been re-upped to, the fund is
now pursuing more mid-market or specialist managers, which Alexander
generally defines as below \$5 billion in fund size or below \$500
million in ticket size.

"It gives us the ability to partner with groups that have either the
expertise or just more levers to pull, particularly on the exit," he
said. "When we look at the mid-market space, we don't think it really
changes as much as some people might claim on the entry price, but we do
see the biggest impact on the exit in terms of how many buyers there are
for mid-market deals than for large-cap deals."

As an LP that generally invests more behind managers on a third vintage
or more, with some exceptions, he did concede opportunities are
sometimes harder to come by.

"Our focus is growing on the mid-market. As that opportunity set does
improve and does increase, we expect to do more but sometimes it's hard
to make it happen," Alexander stated.

The renewed focus has [[seen]{.mark} it [commit]{.mark} in recent years
[to]{.mark} the **[digital infrastructure]{.mark}** sector]{.underline}
through DigitalBridge, DTCP and Berkshire Partners, and in the energy
and energy transition space through LS Power and EnCap Investments,
committing roughly \$50 million to managers.

"We've committed roughly the same amount in recent years. What's changed
is our pipeline is constantly changing. With some of the names we've had
on our pipeline and expected to make a commitment to, things have been
pushed out or delayed. When we do gain conviction in a fund or manager,
we are still committing the same amount of dollars as we were before,"
Alexander maintained.

According to September's annual report, the **[[private income
portfolio]{.underline}]{.mark}** returned 8.8 percent in the last five
years, ending June 2024. In addition to increased asset values, [this
was also [driven by "strong exits" in]{.mark} the
**[infrastructure]{.mark}** portfolio, the report stated.]{.underline}

"A few of our [chunkier [investments]{.mark} saw [exits above]{.mark}
prior [mark]{.mark}, which is what we expect and what the managers tell
us we can achieve]{.underline}. It wasn't a surprise, but it was a nice
increase on prior marks," said Alexander. "It's not that exits really
ramped up across our portfolio, but it was a good driver of returns,
some of which was co-investments. It [[showed]{.mark} the
[**resilience** and]{.mark} the [long-term **attractiveness** of]{.mark}
these **[assets]{.mark}**, even for those that may not have performed to
expectations, that others saw the long-term value of the
businesses."]{.underline}

### Yes spillover if a state does it

Although it was an extreme case, the January 6 crisis was not the only
situation in recent years in which the [**[states]{.mark}** have played
a [crucial]{.mark} role in [setting]{.mark} the [direction of the
**country as a whole**]{.mark}. In areas as varied as access to
firearms, emergency health care, immigration enforcement, cryptocurrency
regulation, and the climate crisis, [states]{.mark} have been
[asserting]{.mark} their **[powers to influence]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and in some cases to challenge, [U.S. policy. **State** leaders
aggressively litigate to block federal policy and are active in
responding to federal developments that contrast with the preferences of
state electoral majorities. And some of the largest
states]{.underline}---California, Florida, New York, and Texas
collectively account for about 37 percent of U.S. GDP---[are
[becoming]{.mark} more [**involved** in **foreign
affairs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not only on economic and social issues
but also through the soft diplomacy of values and culture. In the summer
of 2022, even as the Biden administration was reeling from West
Virginia's successful litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court to limit
federal regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, the president asked
California Governor Gavin Newsom to join a ministerial meeting on
climate with Chinese Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu.

To many observers, such examples may seem anomalous because---according
to the most common understanding of the federal system---the U.S.
government is the country's preeminent source of policy direction and
bears sole responsibility for foreign affairs. Together with lawmakers
in Congress, the president and senior executive branch officials are
viewed as the key agenda-setters on U.S. leadership and how it is
exercised in a tumultuous world. And since the rise of the United States
as a global power is closely associated with the growing centralization
and capacity of the federal government during the twentieth century,
U.S. authority on the world stage has often been associated with a
federal system in which Washington is dominant.

But this conventional understanding is both flawed and out of date. It
is true that the federal government imposes a variety of constraints on
the states and controls key levers of foreign policy. When it comes to
policymaking capacity and on-the-ground implementation, however, [states
increasingly hold a decisive edge---particularly in an era of partisan
gridlock in Washington. And in a world in which economic, technological,
and cultural influence is often spread through subnational regions, the
[largest U.S. states]{.mark} can [make policies with]{.mark} direct
**[global impact.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[As the federal bargain moves in the direction of state power, it will
have [far-reaching consequences for]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates' [global profile and]{.mark} the [conduct of U.S.
foreign policy.]{.mark} Harnessed in the right way, the states can
[enhance U.S. power]{.mark}]{.underline}, providing new and more dynamic
ways to advance an international agenda at a time of federal gridlock,
[while [strengthening **U.S. democracy**]{.mark} at home]{.underline}.
But as the January 6 crisis illustrates, states can also be used to
undermine the country's longstanding alliances or even to subvert the
democratic process. How leaders in Washington, the courts, diplomatic
circles in different regions, and local and state governments approach
this shift will determine whether state-level action becomes a source of
resilience or a destabilizing force for Americans and the world.

The Evolving Federal Bargain

By outward appearance, the expansion of federal powers in the twentieth
century has given Washington the advantage in the federal-state balance.
The Civil War, after all, established the federal government's control
of the military as well as the illegality of unilateral secession by any
state. And the civil rights movement cemented a broad understanding of
federal power to enforce desegregation, voting rights, and school
integration. Moreover, states are limited by balanced-budget
requirements, as well as by their dependence on federal funds for
between a quarter and a third of their budgets---giving the federal
government considerable leverage in getting them to do its bidding.
Congress has made liberal use of its spending powers, for example, to
direct state policy on K--12 education, on the conduct of public
officials through the Hatch Act, and on the expansion of Medicaid
through the Affordable Care Act. Bolstered by constitutional provisions,
such as the power to regulate interstate commerce and fund the military,
the federal government can sometimes preempt state action.

But this account misses much of the story. For one thing, it is true
that the federal government's overall spending is slightly higher than
the combined total spending of states and local governments (\$4.4
trillion to \$3.3 trillion, respectively, in 2019). But [[states
**dwarf**]{.mark} the **[federal]{.mark}** government in their
[budgetary impact]{.mark} on voters]{.underline}: setting aside military
funding, service on the national debt, and entitlements, [in most years
[states]{.mark} and their dependent local governments are [responsible
for]{.mark} the [lion's share of **government
expenditures**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Together, they also employ a far
larger workforce. As of 2020, [state and local governments
[employed]{.mark} nearly **[20 million people]{.mark}**, whereas the
federal government had only about 2.2 million civilian employees and 1.3
million active-duty military personnel. State and local
administrations]{.underline}, not the federal government,
[[set]{.underline}]{.mark} most of the policies that affect the
day-to-day lives of their residents, including [[policies]{.mark}
relating [to **policing**]{.mark}, **[education]{.mark}**, **[land
use,]{.mark}** **[criminal justice]{.mark}**, [**emergency response**,
and **public health**]{.mark}.]{.underline} States have far more control
over education policy, providing over 90 percent of funding for schools
in almost every state. Moreover, the [federal government [depends on
states to implement]{.mark} nearly all major **[federal
policies]{.mark}**, including the most costly: health insurance and
welfare]{.underline}. As states implement federal policy, they exercise
discretion, adjusting it around the margins to suit their own interests.
And thanks to their sizable economies, the largest states can make
decisions that have an impact beyond their own borders. All this has
meant that the federal system is far more adaptable, and states far more
powerful, than has generally been recognized.

Many of the most important U.S. policy innovations were first tried at
the state level.

Particularly striking is the extent to which states can be centers of
policy innovation. They have distinct economies, and although they vary
greatly in size, even the largest and most diverse states have
populations whose interests and attitudes are more cohesive than those
of the country at large. States also tend to be better at assembling big
coalitions to support major policy action, and they do not have the
kinds of procedural hindrances---the filibuster and the absence of the
line-item veto---that often hamper the federal system. As a result,
states have long been drivers of progress and change. As early as the
nineteenth century, for example, Iowa, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania
lifted bans on interracial marriage, even as other states imposed them.
Over time, however, states with bans repealed them as public support for
interracial marriage grew; the Supreme Court's landmark 1967 Loving v.
Virginia decision extended the repeal to the federal level. Indeed, many
of the most important federal policy changes---including ending slavery;
expanding marriage rights, voting rights, and civil rights; changing
health-care access, reproductive rights, and welfare coverage; reforming
public education; and protecting the environment---were first tried at
the state level, making states what U.S. Justice Louis Brandeis called
"laboratories of democracy."

But states do more than test new policy; they also fill in existing
policy gaps when the federal government stalls. Consider the issue of
immigration. Despite an economy that relies heavily on an immigrant
workforce, the United States often leaves those seeking permanent status
in legal limbo for years. As a result, states have filled the policy
gap, with blue states such as California and New York offering access to
health care and education for the undocumented, and red states such as
Arizona and Texas using their own resources to increase border
enforcement and internal patrols. Similarly, when the federal government
failed to impose a strict national standard on auto emissions,
California created its own and, because of the size of its market, was
able to force automakers to manufacture cars nationwide that meet
California's standards. And in the absence of federal policy to address
social media companies' banning users because of their political
viewpoints, Texas legislators enacted a law in 2021 limiting content
moderation. (The law has been temporarily blocked, pending a lawsuit now
making its way through the courts.)

Over the past two decades, states have also gained leverage to
experiment in areas such as legalizing marijuana, despite conflicting
federal law. The states are taking advantage of a federal government
that has pulled back on marijuana-related enforcement unrelated to
organized crime but has failed to repeal federal criminal penalties on
marijuana possession and sale. And with federal action on climate change
increasingly impeded---including, paradoxically, by state-led
challenges, such as West Virginia v. EPA---states have new opportunities
to fill the breach. Already, many states are decarbonizing their energy
sources, and 21 states have set 100 percent clean energy goals. Some are
enacting zoning rules that ban gas hookups in new buildings and are
prohibiting new industry on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions; New
York State denied construction permits to a cryptocurrency mining
operation on the grounds that it was at odds with the state's
sustainability goals. In this dance of adaptation and response between
Washington and the states, the federal system builds in enough
flexibility for U.S. policymakers to innovate and take on major issues
facing the country, even when the federal government is hobbled by
polarization, legislative gridlock, and court-imposed limits.

Networks, Not Nations

Despite their growing role in domestic policy, states may appear to have
little sway in foreign affairs, where nation-to-nation diplomacy and
hard power reign supreme. But in many regions of the world and on a host
of issues such as aviation, ocean management, climate change, and
refugee resettlement, those traditional tools now compete with other
forms of influence. As the scholar Anne-Marie Slaughter has argued,
networks of institutions and individuals---scholars and scientists,
government officials, business executives, and the leaders of social
movements---have long been sharing ideas and coordinating strategies
across borders. In areas of technology policy, these networks have
allowed smaller countries to have global influence that far exceeds
their relative size and hard power: Estonia, for example, has played a
leading part in counter-disinformation strategy, and South Korea has
been a pioneering force in public-private partnerships for online
authentication.

In the United States, [**[international networks]{.mark}** have become a
critical way for the country to assert its leadership on many issues.
When bolstered by [state governments' power]{.mark} to [develop
policy]{.mark} [experiments and set **international standards**]{.mark},
such cross-border exchanges can drive policy innovations---including in
such areas as artificial intelligence (AI), biomedicine, block chain,
and renewable energy---that are becoming more difficult to achieve at
the federal level]{.underline}. It was in part to buttress such networks
in the face of rising geopolitical competition that the U.S. government
was spurred in May 2022 to create the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework---a loose arrangement to promote standard-setting, sustainable
growth and broader economic connections between the United States and
its allies in the region.

States with outsize stakes in energy, trade, and technology have special
incentives to engage in foreign policy. In economic sectors that are
underfunded or left unaddressed by Washington, larger states are seeking
their own international partnerships or agreements to compensate. In
2014, California began a cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec, allowing
the two regions jointly to create the largest carbon market in North
America; in 2022, the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council launched a
partnership with a European Union health industry trade body to promote
cross-border biotechnology research. [Although the U.S. Constitution
prevents states from entering into formal treaty arrangements, the
**[State Department]{.mark}** has [interpreted]{.mark} these
[constraints]{.mark} to apply [only to agreements]{.mark} that are
"**[legally binding]{.mark}**," leaving plenty of room for states to
make international arrangements by other means.]{.underline}

[Even in hard-power conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
**[subnational networks]{.mark}** can play an important role. Notably,
since the war began, Western corporations, responding to pressure from
shareholders and the public, have left the Russian market en masse.
Civil society institutions are working **[with Ukrainian
officials]{.mark}** and technology companies [to thwart]{.mark}
[Russian]{.mark} disinformation [efforts]{.mark}. And local communities
are signaling their openness to receiving refugees.]{.underline} Of
course, different U.S. states have different geopolitical interests: a
more open trade policy tends to benefit oil-producing Louisiana and
Texas far more than it does Michigan or North Carolina, whose
populations may fear losing more jobs overseas under such a policy.
Rather than leading to greater centralization of power, then, the
current age of growing geopolitical conflict and accelerating
technological change seems likely to push more states to become involved
in national and international affairs.

A Hidden Arsenal

As states assert their interests even more actively in the coming years,
they will have a variety of tools to choose from. For one thing, they
can count on broad public support. Consider the impact over the past
year of public discourse about such national controversies as school
shootings, court decisions, business and environmental regulation, and
natural disasters. Polling data suggest that the failure of the federal
government to address these and other issues has alienated significant
parts of the electorate. Gallup reports that 39 percent of Americans
trust the federal government to handle domestic problems, down from the
historical average of 53 percent. At the same time, more than half of
Americans continue to have confidence in their state governments and
two-thirds express trust in their local governments. Civil society and
state leaders may therefore be emboldened to reject or refuse to comply
with unpopular federal laws.

During the implementation of the U.S.A. Patriot Act following the
September 11, 2001, attacks, for example, people began to question the
act's loose definition of "domestic terrorism" and its provisions for
information sharing, and they expressed concern that protest and civil
disobedience would be classified as terrorist acts, dampening citizens'
First Amendment rights. Five states---Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana,
and Vermont---passed resolutions questioning the act's constitutionality
and limiting its application. In the last decade, with respect to
immigration policy, 11 states and hundreds of cities and counties have
declared themselves to be "sanctuaries" for undocumented people, meaning
that they will not comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
requests to extend detention and will otherwise separate their law
enforcement from federal deportation activities. And in response to the
Supreme Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade in June 2022---which occurred
despite recent polling by Gallup showing that a clear majority of
Americans (55 percent) identify as pro-choice---nearly 100 elected
prosecutors, including several state attorneys general, have pledged
that they will not enforce abortion bans.

In fact, West Virginia v. EPA is only one of the most recent cases in
which a state has successfully challenged a major federal policy. In
2007, Massachusetts successfully litigated a case forcing the EPA to
plan regulatory measures addressing climate change. During the Obama
administration, Texas challenged an executive action that protected
certain undocumented immigrants from deportation. California challenged
the Trump administration's move to reduce the state's flexibility to set
vehicle emission standards. Under extreme circumstances, civil society
leaders, candidates for local and state office, and state officeholders
could support changes in state laws to limit cooperation between state
and federal revenue authorities or even encourage companies and
individuals not to comply with federal tax or regulatory mandates. They
could draw on anti-commandeering doctrines enshrined in Supreme Court
jurisprudence, establishing that the federal government cannot coerce
states or state officials to adopt or enforce federal laws. With such a
range of tools, states are well positioned to take advantage of the
federal government's inability to act. As narrow majorities and growing
polarization have made the federal government less functional, many
states have become more politically homogeneous, with a single party now
controlling both the legislature and the governor's office in 37 states,
facilitating legislative action. At the same time, larger cities have
found new ways to flex their economic muscle abroad, regardless of
federal policy. In other words, the time is ripe for states and cities
to assert themselves, and they are doing so.

From Sacramento to Seoul

The growing power of states is already reshaping U.S. foreign policy. As
states experiment with policies that the rest of the country isn't ready
to support, they can exert an immediate impact abroad: California's zero
emission vehicle policy, for example, was a blueprint for a similar
scheme in China. Given the special regional and international ties of
some metropolitan areas---consider greater Miami's profile in Latin
America---states and their constituent cities can also leverage their
soft power and convening capacity to facilitate policy coordination and
form coalitions with like-minded foreign governments. [And
**[states]{.mark}** can also use the [flexibility in existing U.S. law
to collaborate on **international agreements** to address]{.mark}
[problems]{.mark} of global significance **[neglected by
Washington]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The potential for state-led action is large. Already, states have
pledged adherence to international climate change treaty provisions and
are forming agreements with foreign governments to achieve
sustainability goals. Other areas in which states seem likely to take
the lead include supply chain resilience and industrial policy
coordination; regional trading arrangements; long-term research and
development partnerships; international standard setting, as, for
example, in environmental regulations; and new forms of international
diplomacy. Just as important, however, are the risks that a more
decentralized U.S. posture in the world could pose. Subnational
diplomacy involving states and research institutions may conceivably
complicate national strategies for safeguarding sensitive information
from other countries. And as states increasingly use litigation to
contest federal action, foreign governments may be able to exploit
tensions between states and the federal government, for example, through
disinformation operations. If functional federalism is a strategic
asset, dysfunctional federalism could be a recipe for weakening U.S.
power.

The States Strike Back

As the January 6, 2021, crisis revealed, federalism cuts both ways in
the U.S. electoral process. In addition to designing and executing new
policies in domains as varied as cryptocurrency, technology transfer,
and immigrant integration, state officials are responsible for specific
procedures to administer elections, count votes, and report results. For
decades, Americans believed that the various democratic safeguards
rooted in the court system, the media, and civic norms allowed the
country to navigate federal-state tensions with sagacity. But
particularly after the assault on the U.S. Capitol, it's plausible to
take a much darker view. With norms crumbling, a polarized public, and
party leaders egging them on, many state officials could aggressively
seek partisan advantage even if doing so means thwarting the public's
vote. The Supreme Court may embrace the so-called independent state
legislature doctrine, which would potentially countenance state
legislative efforts to ignore the popular vote in their states and
appoint desired slates of replacement electors. If current efforts to
reform the rickety Electoral Count Act are unsuccessful, partisan
federal lawmakers could argue that the act allows federal legislative
majorities to ignore duly appointed electoral slates.

But in such a scenario, states could fight back. In The Federalist
Papers, no. 45 and no. 46, James Madison argued that states play a
crucial role as backstops against federal overreach and called on them
to sound the alarm in response to undemocratic action by the federal
government. A particularly vivid example concerns a future effort to
manipulate a presidential election result. If in a presidential contest
in which their candidate loses, Republicans try to stir up sufficient
suspicion about the outcome in, say, Georgia or Arizona to certify rival
electoral slates and take the presidency, other states such as
California or New York could take a variety of extreme measures to
resist. Among other steps, they could suspend cooperation with the
federal government, opt out of or subvert federal-state agreements,
sever connections between state and federal law enforcement, and
symbolically seize federal property. Whether these actions spur greater
risk of political violence within and across states---particularly if
pursued simultaneously by multiple states---they would virtually
guarantee that a unified American global strategy would be severely
undermined.

But the larger point is that such a course of action, however damaging,
would allow the states to play a critical role in sustaining the
democratic process in the event of a national crisis. When an election
is at risk of being overturned by extraconstitutional means, and
federal-level political or judicial safeguards fail to defend democracy,
[the states can serve as a last resort, [drawing on]{.mark} the
integrity of local officials and institutions as well as the
[states']{.mark} latent [capabilities]{.mark} to frustrate routine
federal activity in extraordinary circumstances. State resistance can
[prove to be a **democracy-preserving action**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Resilience From Below

As policy innovators, [shapers of foreign policy, and even defenders of
U.S. democracy, states have far more influence than is commonly
recognized, and they are poised to build on it in the years to
come]{.underline}. To manage this growing role, the U.S. government,
state leaders, and the voters themselves must approach the federal
system strategically and mitigate the inherent risks of
decentralization.

First, state [governments should further develop their potential to act
as "**[laboratories of democracy]{.mark}**" in the U.S. federal system,
[collaborating]{.mark} with one another when they develop [new]{.mark}
[policies]{.mark} and standards, to [shape global developments]{.mark}
in ways that advance U.S. interests. States can force action on
international climate agreements, reinvigorate immigration strategies,
and forge crucial international research partnerships]{.underline}.
Doing so will help set the global agenda, but it will also help preserve
the viability and strength of the United States in the world order.

Second, foreign governments can strengthen their long-term relationships
with the United States, regardless of who is in power in Washington, by
building ties with individual states and their dependent cities. Areas
for collaboration include setting technology standards for AI and carbon
footprint calculations, investment in scientific research and
technology, and support for ideals such as humanitarian relief or
freedom of religion through, say, assistance for refugee resettlement.
In all these areas, states can be sources of progress as well as offer
continuity in foreign relations.

Third, policymakers in Washington should recognize the value of allowing
states to experiment on core issues and even engage with them globally.
Congress should reestablish the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental
Relations---a federal panel defunded in 1996 that included state, local,
and federal policymakers who periodically evaluated the current health
of the federal system---to provide a further means for informal
negotiation and sharing best practices. When congressional action on an
issue isn't possible, federal agencies should partner with their state
equivalents to pursue policy goals. Federal courts, too, would do well
to bear in mind---to the extent relevant disputes allow---that states
need room to maneuver within the federal system.

In another January 6 crisis, states could act to safeguard U.S.
democracy.

That said, leaders in major states should also plan for the possibility
of severe or prolonged federal dysfunction, especially involving future
disruptions of the electoral process. As a start, state policymakers can
help the public become more educated about the federal system and how it
could be manipulated for malign purposes. Although the federal-state
balance is an underappreciated source of strength with the potential to
drive progress on a host of global issues, it also raises difficult and
sometimes painful questions for the United States and the world. In the
United States, federalism also reflects a racist history, in which
states were able to prevent Blacks from voting, receiving quality
education, and fully participating in the economy, as well as restrict
where they could live and socialize. As major states become more
assertive, their actions will bring new risks as well as new
possibilities. Whether this more complex federal system improves policy,
bolsters democracy, and enhances America's role in the world depends on
who uses the instruments of federalism and for what purposes. When
citizens fail to pay attention, states are vulnerable to strategic abuse
by those who would weaponize federalism for party or private interests,
against the public and against democracy.

At its best, the [[**constant interplay** between]{.mark} the [states
and]{.mark} the [federal]{.mark} government can [provide]{.mark} a
powerful **[strategic advantage]{.mark}** to the United States.
[States]{.mark} can contribute to [continued]{.mark} U.S. leadership on
the most vital international policy challenges of our time, as well as
ensure the resilience of the U.S. system, helping to preserve and
[defend democratic institutions]{.mark} and practices]{.underline}. In a
more pessimistic scenario, however, the federal bargain could become a
source of conflict and tension. And as other countries exploit growing
rifts, key states could be left looking to each other and the world

Governors Engagement in Foreign Affairs," National Governors
Association,

[[**Governors** can play a **key role** in **foreign affairs**]{.mark},
helping shape global economic, cultural, and political relations.
Relationships between Governors and foreign entities are
dynamic,]{.underline} focused on both outward priorities, such as
building relationships with foreign partners, as well as inward
concerns, such as protecting their states from foreign threats. In
building and maintaining such relationships, it is important for
Governors to be mindful of the significant role they play in broader
foreign policy, and to be cautious to ensure that engagements with
foreign people and businesses are properly vetted. As long as state
efforts do not derogate the sovereignty of the U.S. or seriously
interfere with foreign defense or other federal policies, [Governors
have [a **lot of latitude**]{.mark} to do what they feel comfortable
with [in foreign sectors.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Common ways for Governors to participate in foreign affairs
[include]{.mark}]{.underline} the following:

[[**Receiving foreign dignitaries or traveling
abroad**;]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Organizing and [participating in **economic trade missions** and
**supporting foreign direct investment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark}

[Strengthening cultural engagement or establishing sister state
relationships;]{.underline}

[[Engaging in **foreign partnerships** and
**agreements;**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Issuing statements on foreign matters;]{.underline} or

[Providing humanitarian aid during foreign conflicts or
emergencies.]{.underline}

Some [states have established dedicated offices, councils, or
subagencies focused on the state's engagement in **international
affairs**. These entities may be tasked with devising the states
international strategy; pursuing and building **business**, **trade**,
and **cultural relationships** with foreign partners; and often oversee,
coordinate, and evaluate international activities of other state
agencies.]{.underline} Some [Governors may]{.underline} also [designate
a **state foreign relations lead**]{.underline}, such as the Lt.
Governor, Secretary of State, or other official, [that may serve as a
**representative** on behalf of the state when meeting with foreign
governments or businesses]{.underline}. Other state programs, such as a
National Guard's participation in the State Partnership Program, also
contribute to a state's global presence.

While it is a truism that globalization blurs cultural and economic
boundaries, rarely is the same said of legal and political dimensions.20
As some international legal scholars have observed, "while transnational
economics has drawn the most attention," globalization has presaged
unprecedented growth in "political cooperation, migration, and
communication" while eroding the "concept of physical territory as an
organizing principle for social, cultural, economic, or political
relations."21 By extension, the laws and legal principles governing
these globalizing spheres are impacted as well.22 The rapid
proliferation and sophistication of nonbinding international agreements
is the most pronounced manifestation of international law and relations
23 While these arrangements have largely gone unnoticed, much less faced
many legal challenges, the fallout over the Paris Agreement has drawn
unprecedented attention to the increasingly blurry jurisdictional
boundaries between state and federal governments in foreign affairs.24

Most emblematic of this controversy was the 2019 case of United States
v. California, where the Trump Administration challenged California's
cap-and-trade agreement with the Canadian province of Quebec, on the
grounds that it violates several foreign affairs powers exclusive to the
federal government.25 Described as "uncharted territory" by legal
observers, the case brought to light a practice that will likely
increase in the coming decades.26 The forces of globalization will
continue to blend and erode cultural and economic boundaries. States and
even cities will have unparalleled global connectivity, upending
established political and jurisdictional limitations through both formal
and informal agreements.27

Even the COVID-19 pandemic, with all its disruptions to global travel,
trade, and cooperation, failed to fully dampen this trend. In April
2020, as coronavirus infections began to spike in the U.S.,
[[**Maryland** procured]{.mark} 500,000 [test kits from]{.mark}
**[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea through negotiations [involving
"**high level state officials**" and]{.mark} the **[So]{.mark}**uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rean [Ministry of **Foreign
Affairs**]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 The same year, [[**Florida** moved
towards]{.mark} creating an "**[intergovernmental structure]{.mark}**"
between its [health agency and]{.mark} the [Canadian **health
department**]{.mark} to purchase cheaper prescription drugs from
Canada]{.underline}.29 These are just two examples of state engagement
abroad that managed to receive media attention; as this Note will
reveal, such [[practices]{.mark} are [so **common** and]{.mark} tacitly
**[acceptable]{.mark}** that they [rarely garner any
**publicity**]{.mark}, much less controversy or legal
challenge.]{.underline}

Notwithstanding the surprising commonality of such arrangement, this
Note will explore whether state and local governments in the United
States have the power to conduct foreign relations independently of the
federal government. Part I explores how [Subnational Foreign Relations
(SFR)---known variably as "paradiplomacy" or
"glocalization]{.underline}30---fit within the U.S. federal framework,
both constitutionally and customarily. Part II examines how the courts
have scrutinized SFR in all its manifestations, striking it down in some
forms and circumstances, and allowing them in others. Part III looks at
the political response, particularly by Congress and the Executive, as
well as by state and local officials. Part IV will compare how other
countries address the use of such "soft law" by their subnational
entities. Part V analyzes how subnational foreign relations operate
within international legal norms and principles. Finally, Part VI will
consider how governments at all levels rely on informal or nonbinding
international agreements to further their interests and those of their
constituents, whether in response to pressing challenges like climate
change or as part of routine affairs of state.

This Note will conclude that [[**subnational entities** in]{.mark} the
**[U.S.]{.mark}** can and [should have relations with **foreign
governments**]{.mark} and entities. Contrary to popular belief,
**[states]{.mark}** and even cities are [permitted far more **legal**
and **political flexibility**]{.mark} [to fulfill]{.mark} their
[interests]{.mark} [vis-à-vis]{.mark} the **[international
community]{.mark}**. Subnational Foreign Relations can and do operate
**[within]{.mark}** the reasonable limits set by the U.S.
[**Constitution**, **Congress**, and]{.mark} the
**[judiciary]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The forces of globalization---which
had just begun sprouting when the Constitution was ratified---warrant
redefining the federalist framework adequate with the realities and
challenges of the twenty-first century.

[Congressional **Republicans' bold suggestion** that future disaster
funding be **tied to forest management reforms** or a debt ceiling
increase is prompting stern warnings that the maneuver could harm
wildfire victims and backfire politically.]{.underline}

[**Democrats came out in force** Monday **to blast** the strategy that
**Republican lawmakers** and President-elect Donald Trump
concocted]{.underline} over the weekend, calling it a political ploy
that could undermine recovery efforts and put Republicans on a slippery
slope.

"[I cannot think of anything less wise than tying relief to other
political issues," said Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House's **top
Democratic appropriator**. "That we would condition disaster aid is
**unthinkable**."]{.underline}

[The **clash** is illustrative of the **building frustration over** the
deadly **wildfires**]{.underline} [that are still growing]{.underline}
around Los Angeles, and it threatens to complicate the outlook for
supplemental disaster aid this spring.

[The ongoing discussion among Republican lawmakers also signals the
beginning of a **nasty fight over** **wildfire**, drought and land
**management policy** that is all but certain to **intensify this
Congress** **under Republican leadership.**]{.underline}

[House Speaker Mike **Johnson**]{.underline} (R-La.) [told reporters
Monday that "we've got to have a serious conversation]{.underline}"
about conditioning disaster aid, pointing to "[water resource
mismanagement, forest **management mistakes, all sorts of
problems**]{.underline}," to which Republicans have been attributing
California's wildfires.

Johnson, who supported the \$100 billion disaster relief bill that
Congress passed last month, said Monday that the need to put guardrails
on future aid was his "personal view" and that Republican lawmakers are
still discussing the idea.

[Senate Majority Whip John **Barrasso** (R-Wyo.) said]{.underline} on
CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that "there can't be a blank check on
this" and that he expected "there will be strings attached to money that
is ultimately approved" because of California's "**[gross failure" to
prevent the blazes]{.underline}**.

[Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) told Fox News that]{.underline}
"California wants the money without changing the [**policies that are
making the problem bad** or worse," including forest
management]{.underline}.

And [Rep. Tom McClintock]{.underline}, a California Republican who
represents part of the Sierra Nevada, penned an op-ed in the Wall Street
Journal [**blaming environmental laws** and what he sees as lax forest
management for the fires' spread.]{.underline}

"The tragedy in Southern California is the result of decades of
self-destructive policies by foolish politicians," McClintock said,
lamenting declines in timber harvesting and livestock grazing to keep
growth in check.

Davidson suggested that California be forced to change its land
management or forestry policies to mitigate future fires in order to
receive the funding, though he did not lay out specific changes. Others
have floated attaching language to raise the debt ceiling, a politically
charged process that Republicans could struggle to approve on their own
given conservative resistance.

[**Congressional Republicans are not wholly united** on the disaster aid
issue. Multiple lawmakers told POLITICO's E&E News on Monday that they
would not back efforts to **threaten to withhold aid in order to advance
a specific policy priority**. Given the **fractured state of the
Republican conference**, that kind of division could **doom the
proposal** early]{.underline}.

[But the strategy is weighing heavy on Democrats]{.underline}. Many have
pointed to Trump's efforts during his first term to delay the delivery
of disaster relief to California and other states that he considered
politically hostile to him.

"Relief for disaster victims should never be held hostage, [particularly
in an effort to help President Trump and Republicans raise the debt
ceiling so they can dole out more tax cuts to
billionaires]{.underline}," [said Senate Appropriations ranking member
Patty Murray (D-Wash.), whose home state Trump targeted in 2020 by
refusing to approve disaster funding.]{.underline}

Disaster aid 'proxy war'

President Joe Biden has already declared the fires a major disaster and
has said the federal government will cover 100 percent of the costs for
the first six months.

Trump, who takes office next week, could slow walk the delivery of some
disaster aid, and the Republican-led Congress is in position to prevent
the appropriation of more money if they so choose.

[Some **Democrats said there would be consequences for Republicans** if
they went down the path of making aid conditional]{.underline}.

"This is a Mistake. If you start this, it will never end," Florida
Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a former emergency management director,
wrote on X. "When Dems retake the House, they will condition aid to
Florida and Texas. **[Disaster Aid must stay non
partisan."]{.underline}**

[Moskowitz]{.underline}, one of Congress biggest disaster relief
boosters, said in a brief interview last month that if one party begins
withholding aid to achieve a policy or political goal, "what happens is
it becomes a proxy war."

[He pointed to some Republicans' refusal to support disaster aid after
Superstorm Sandy slammed the mostly Democratic Northeast in 2012 and the
way some **Democrats resisted support** for disaster aid **following**
Hurricane **Harvey**'s catastrophic landfall in Texas in
2017.]{.underline}

disaster.

"[Playing politics with people's livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap
in the face]{.underline} to the Southern California wildfire victims and
to our brave first responders," Republican Rep. Young Kim, whose closely
divided district is anchored in fire-prone Orange County, southeast of
Los Angeles, said in a statement.

In an interview aired Wednesday night, [Trump said he may withhold aid
to California until the state adjusts how it manages its scarce water
resources.]{.underline} He falsely claimed that California's fish
conservation efforts in the northern part of the state are responsible
for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas.

["I don't think we should give California anything until they let the
water run down," Trump told Fox News']{.underline} Sean Hannity.

Local officials have said the conservation efforts for the delta smelt
had nothing to do with the hydrants running dry as firefighters tried to
contain blazes around Los Angeles. They said intense demand on a
municipal system not designed to battle such blazes was to blame.

[Marjorie Taylor Greene]{.underline}, who has earned the dubious honour
of being one of the most unhinged US politicians in recent memory, has
an important message for the American people: they control the weather.
Last week, in the wake of the devastation from Hurricane Helene, the
far-right representative from Georgia [tweeted]{.underline} the
following: "[Yes they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for
anyone to lie and say it can't be done."]{.underline}

Who is they? Good question. Greene might have meant the non-binary deep
state that secretly controls the world. Or, considering she has
previously insinuated that [California wildfires were started by energy
companies, in conjunction with the Rothschilds, using a space laser, in
order to facilitate high-speed rail projects, she might have meant
Jewish people.]{.underline} She certainly won't elaborate. She's been
asked to clarify her antisemitic "Jewish space lasers" comment plenty of
times and likes to tell reporters to "fuck off".

[It's]{.underline} also [possible]{.underline} that [Greene meant the
government]{.underline}. (Of which, of course, she is a representative
-- something she often seems to forget.) Before her they post, Greene
posted a map of the south-eastern US with the message: "[This is a map
of hurricane affected areas with an overlay of electoral map by
political party shows how hurricane devastation could affect the
election."]{.underline}

In other words: [Greene]{.underline} seemingly [thinks that the
Democratic party engineered a devastating hurricane to wipe out voters
in Republican areas so that Kamala Harris will win the
election.]{.underline} Very normal stuff.

Alas, [Greene is not the only person spreading ridiculous conspiracy
theories]{.underline} about Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton being
engineered by the government. Social media is awash with them. I was
disturbed to see an acquaintance from my elementary school, who
unfortunately went down an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theory rabbit hole
during Covid, post on Facebook that Hurricane Helene had been created by
BlackRock because it bought shares in a lithium mining company in
Asheville, North Carolina[. How do you reason with someone who believes
this sort of nonsense?]{.underline}

[You don't, is the simple answer.]{.underline} Having arguments with
random individuals who have drunk a lot of conspiracy Kool-Aid is rarely
productive. What's more productive, I think, is understanding where
these ideas come from. They come, of course, from people feeling
powerless and excluded. But, more specifically, I think these particular
conspiracies about man-made hurricanes stem from the fact that the media
hasn't done a very good job of explaining geoengineering.

Donald Trump's final White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, pressured
the acting attorney general to help push the lie of electoral fraud in
Trump's defeat by Joe Biden -- even asking him to investigate a
conspiracy theory which said [people in Italy used military satellites
to make US voting machines switch votes for Biden.]{.underline}

So reported the New York Times on Saturday night, even as Trump made a
return to the public stage with a speech to Republicans in North
Carolina.

In Greenville, Trump repeated his lies about his clear defeat by Biden,
which he called "the crime of the century".

Before he became Trump's fourth and final chief of staff, Meadows was a
hard-right congressman from North Carolina and a loyal Trump supporter.
The Times said he emailed acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen five
times in December and January.

One email dealt with the "Italygate" conspiracy theory, the Times said,
adding that Rosen refused to set up a meeting with a former CIA agent
pushing the claims online.

Another email reportedly echoed claims by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's
personal lawyer who led a legal challenge to election results largely
laughed out of court, that [results in New Mexico were affected by
fraud. There is no evidence that was the case.]{.underline}

Rosen resisted Meadows and also rebuffed Trump directly, citing former
attorney general William Barr's view that there was no large-scale fraud
in the 2020 election, the Times said.

Trump reportedly considered replacing Rosen with an official more
amenable to attempts to overturn the election. But Rosen stayed in place
through the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January, when Trump
supporters sought to disrupt the certification of election results.

W Neil Eggleston, White House counsel under Barack Obama, told the Times
DoJ "enforcement mechanisms should not be used for political purpose or
for the personal benefit of the president ... if the White House is
involved in an investigation, there is at least a sense that there is a
political angle to it."

Asha Rangappa, a former FBI agent turned CNN analyst and editor for Just
Security, tweeted: "[We are at a place where Republican voters can more
easily be convinced that Italy (?) secretly altered ballots using remote
technology than that simply more people voted for a normal candidate
from the opposing party."]{.underline}

The academic and author Norman Ornstein said pushing the Italygate
conspiracy theory made Meadows an "unAmerican traitor to our fundamental
values \[who\] does not belong in a civil and democratic society or
political system."

The emails were discovered by the Senate judiciary committee.

In a statement, the Democratic committee chairman, Dick Durbin of
Illinois, said: "This new evidence underscores the depths of the White
House's efforts to co-opt the department and influence the electoral
vote certification.

"I will demand all evidence of Trump's efforts to weaponise the justice
department in his election subversion scheme."

[The first six months of the Trump administration have been a policy
whiplash, particularly]{.underline} for those of us following [climate
change]{.underline} impacts [and the]{.underline} oversized [need for
federal investments in preparedness funding, policies, technical
assistance, and outreach.]{.underline} UCS released a study, Science and
Democracy Under Siege, this week that explains exactly why we're all
feeling that whiplash. The study catalogs [the president's 402 attacks
on science during his first 6 months,]{.underline} almost [double the
207 from his entire first term.]{.underline} You may recall [on
inauguration day]{.underline} how [President Trump signed]{.underline}
26 executive orders, [7]{.underline} of which were [attacks on major
climate change policies, such as withdrawing from the Paris
Agreement.]{.underline} Within his first month he had signed 73 orders,
undoing major climate and environmental policy milestones and progress
from previous administrations.

[The Trump administration caused whiplash to federal agencies as well,
including those that implement environmental regulations and provide
weather predictions and research/satellite data]{.underline} that we
rely on. [Federal agencies experienced brutal staffing
cuts]{.underline}, including at the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) (-24%), Department of Energy (DOE) (-13%), and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (-11%). [FEMA
lost one-third of its staff,]{.underline} many of whom were senior. All
of these agencies are going through a brain drain that will take
countless years to replace.

Adding salt to the wounds are the large budget cuts to federal agencies:
NOAA suffered a proposed 27% budget cut (which was pushed back thanks to
advocacy efforts like yours and ours), while [the administration cut
FEMA programs]{.underline} like the Building Resilient Infrastructure
and Communities (BRIC) Program.

While the immediate whiplash is being felt by those of us who are
tracking climate-related policy on a daily basis and those within the
federal government, the ultimate whiplash will be felt by communities on
the ground who rely on the federal government when things get tough.
They live their lives counting on the federal government to help with
their resilience building, and to respond and assist when a catastrophe
hits, like the flash flood disaster in Central Texas. But not under this
Trump administration. Nope[, this administration has been
planning]{.underline} all along [to dismantle FEMA and push the disaster
response and recovery burden to the states.]{.underline} As I wrote in
my recent blog, the Trump administration's plan and dysfunction unfolded
in Texas tragically, to the horror of us all.

Speaker Mike [Johnson (R-La.)]{.underline} on Monday [threw his support
behind placing stipulations on aid designed to help California recover
from]{.underline} historically [devastating wildfires]{.underline},
while accusing local officials of water resource and forest
mismanagement. He re-upped that position Tuesday, and [many Republicans
--- including some in the Golden State --- are echoing that
sentiment.]{.underline}

"There will have to be conditions," Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), who
represents the San Joaquin Valley in Central and Northern California,
told The Hill. "We can't allow the policies that have created the
conditions for such a disaster to continue. There's an old saying, 'You
can't fill a broken bucket by pouring more water in it.' At some point
you've got to fix the bucket."

Democrats, however, are shooting down that prospect, contending the
conversation about California's policies should be separate from any
discussion about assistance for those in need.

"We can have a lengthy debate and discussion and use the committee
process to have discussions about the steps that California has taken to
protect itself. But at the end of the day, ultimately this will mean
disaster assistance, and that needs to be free from partisan
conditions," House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, the
highest-ranking California Democrat on Capitol Hill, said Tuesday.

The emerging discussion comes as wildfires are still raging through
California and as winds that could worsen conditions are expected to
pick up in the coming days. Some lawmakers say the wildfires are on
track to be the most damaging and expensive natural disaster in U.S.
history.

[Republicans haven't come to a public agreement on what conditions
should be included in the aid package: At least one is calling for
policy changes on the local level, some want the legislation to be paid
for, and others have floated tying a debt limit increase to the
assistance.]{.underline}

"**[We got to get a pound of flesh for any dollar that's
spent]{.underline}** on California, in my opinion," said Rep. Ralph
Norman (R-S.C.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

Asked by The Hill on Tuesday what stipulations he is considering,
Johnson responded "I'm not going to project what that might be," before
taking aim at state officials, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom
(D).

"If Gavin Newsom and local leaders made decisions that made this
disaster exponentially worse, which it appears there were, should there
be some consequence to that? Should there be some sort of safeguard on
the funding?" Johnson said. "We're going to be looking at policies, and
we're going to be looking at culpability, and I think that's going to be
a very important thing, not just for Congress, but for the American
people."

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), a 22-year veteran of the House who
represents San Diego, sounded a similar note, saying "nobody's made any
ideas on conditions, but we are looking at everything related to this
incredible, disastrous and damaging fire."

#### Wildfire legislation trades off with the continuing resolution

**Semyon, 25** \[Cassie Semyon is a reporter in the Spectrum News
Washington, D.C., bureau, covering news of interest to California, its
congressional delegation, and national stories. \"Government funding
bill leaves out CA wildfire relief\" Spectrum News, 3-4-2025; accessed

https://spectrumlocalnews.com/mo/st-louis/politics/2025/03/11/government-funding-bill-leaves-out-ca-wildfire-relief\]
alf

Over the weekend, Johnson unveiled a 99-page bill that would fund the
government through September 30th, besides boosting spending for defense
by about \$6 billion and cutting nondefense programs by \$13 billion.

The bill also grants the Trump administration's request for an increase
in immigration enforcement while freezing billions in special funding
for the IRS.

[Wildfire disaster relief was also left out of the stopgap funding
measure.]{.underline}

A source familiar with the ongoing negotiations over disaster relief
told Spectrum News that when Governor Gavin Newsom's request came in
late last month, it needed to be reviewed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the Small Business Administration in addition to
the appropriations committee.

That review process is underway, according to the source, who added that
they do not view this continuing resolution as a delay in getting
disaster aid for the California families that need it.

Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., expressed disappointment that Republicans
"are not really engaging with this yet," and that [Governor Newsom's
federal funding request was not included in this bill.]{.underline} But
he also wanted to assure his constituents that work was still being done
to try to secure the funding.

"FEMA and SBA have enough money to do everything they're planning to do
or could do in the next 2 to 3 months. So the fact that the money isn't
in this bill is not going to interrupt the effort --- as long as we get
our job done in the next few months," promised Sherman. "We need to
provide real help to those who lost everything in the Eaton Fire and, of
course, the Palisades Fire."

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has been staunchly against the continuing
resolution throughout the weekend, and other Republicans have come out
against the bill as well Monday night --- though many of them would not
say they were a "hard no," meaning leadership or President Donald Trump
themselves might sway them.

Sherman, following House Democratic Leadership, said he is a 'no' on the
proposed continuing resolution --- but said he wouldn't be surprised if
Speaker Johnson can conjure the Republican votes necessary in the final
hours to push the bill across the finish line.

"Almost every Republican does whatever Trump tells them, even if it's
the exact opposite of what he told them to do the day before. And even
if it's the exact opposite of what they've stood for, during decades in
Congress. Trump has a vice-like grip on all but perhaps one member of
the Republican delegation," he said.

Sen. Alex Padilla, in a statement to Spectrum News, criticized House
[Republicans]{.underline} for [leaving wildfire relief out of the
bill,]{.underline} but didn't necessarily rule out supporting the bill
if it makes it to the Senate.

"[The House Republican spending bill completely shortchanges California
and other disaster-stricken states like the Carolinas on disaster
relief.]{.underline} We cannot leave communities in our states behind as
they continue to rebuild and recover from devastating recent disasters,"
said Padilla. "The best path forward is for Congress to immediately pass
a 30-day CR to keep the government open while we continue negotiations
to fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year in a way
that properly funds disaster relief and doesn't cede more power to Trump
and Elon Musk."

And while House Democrats have remained steadfast in their position
against the bill, freshman Rep. Laura Friedman, D-Calif. is trying to
amend the legislation, though [the chances of it being added to the
legislation are slim to none.]{.underline}

The Burbank congresswoman introduced an amendment that proposes by
signing the bill into law, President Donald Trump will recognize and
uphold Congress' constitutional authority to authorize and appropriate
funds and will disburse the funds "faithfully and in full."

The amendment is the latest attempt by Democrats to get Republicans to
push back against Trump, whom Democrats say has been trampling on
congressional authority in recent weeks.

#### Expanding AI in the Arctic conveys deterrence and pushes geopolitical tensions over the brink

previously written and produced content for a range of online
publications. He has a bachelor's degree in English, from Huddersfield

Swiss Re Institute's 2023 SONAR report has highlighted [**malicious
attacks on artificial intelligence** systems and **potential clashes**
over new trading routes **in the Arctic** as possible threats as the
risk landscape continues to burgeon.]{.underline}

swiss-re-logoSwiss Re's 2023 SONAR report covers 17 new risks and trends
across technological, economic, social and environmental areas.

One key emerging risk identified in the report is the potential
[geo-political issue that may stem from the "Arctic
opening]{.underline}".

"As the Arctic Ocean and adjacent land are warming up two to three times
faster than the rest of the globe, the ice is melting, and new shortcut
shipping routes are opening up," explains Swiss Re.

The reinsurer suggests that the area is a "[**hotspot for potential
geopolitical tension**", and provokes concern over how economic
activities and related risks will be controlled in the
region]{.underline}.

Register for the Artemis London 2025 cat bond and ILS market conference

Patrick Raaflaub, Swiss Re's Group Chief Risk Officer, commented, "[The
concurrent **increases in economic** interests, environmental change and
**geopolitical tensions** make the **Arctic** a hotbed for emerging
risks and potential **risk accumulation**]{.underline}."

"With SONAR, we aim to proactively engage our clients and industry
stakeholders in discussion of emerging risks, as we find this is the
best way to be prepared."

Meanwhile, in what Swiss Re describes as a "more futuristic but
potentially significant risk", the report highlights solar radiation
management (SRM) technology, which could be used to cool the earth.

Swiss Re writes, "While this does not address the root cause of global
warming, namely greenhouse gas emissions, it could help lower global
temperatures.

"However, techniques such as injecting highly reflective particles into
the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space could open up a whole
new set of environmental risks and the potential for international
conflicts."

The firm continues, "If implemented and then suddenly terminated, the
result of SRM could be fast temperature increases, bringing on related
weather effects.

"[It could lead to an increase or geographical shift]{.underline} of
extreme weather events like droughts or hurricanes. The question would
be how to compensate those experiencing negative effects."

Another emerging [risk in the technology space could **derive from
complex machine learning systems and AI**.]{.underline}

Swiss Re suggests that [professional hackers can not only trick models
into making mistakes or leaking information, but they can also harm
model performance by corrupting training data or stealing and extracting
machine learning models.]{.underline}

The firm's SONAR report emphasises how the [rise of AI is increasing
opportunities for fraud]{.underline} and intellectual property loss,
such as phoney creditworthiness ratings or false insurance scores.

The reinsurer states, "In car insurance, AI-based claims management
systems may even be tricked into seeing massive damage where there is
none.

"If AI gets hacked, it could even result in physical harm by causing
autonomous car crashes or medical misdiagnose

#### Deterrence [fuels]{.underline} arms racing\-\--[idiots]{.underline} control nukes and fight [pointless wars]{.underline}.

Technology Sydney and Griffith University, Professor of International
Politics at the University of Western Australia; "Nukes don't stop war,

[From Vietnam to Ukraine]{.underline}, the [real-world record of
**nuclear deterrence** suggests it's better at **fuelling arms races**
than preventing bloodshed]{.underline}, writes Mark Beeson.

THERE'S NOTHING quite like a real-world test of a theoretical
proposition to instil confidence in the conventional wisdom.
Unfortunately, if it's the credibility of nuclear weapons as the
ultimate form of deterrence that's in question, not many of us are
likely to be around if the assumption proves unfounded.

What [we do know]{.underline} is [that **nuclear weapons have no
capacity to deter conventional wars**]{.underline}, [**even if** we
**assume** that nuclear powers]{.underline} might [**think twice** about
getting into a fight with similarly equipped rivals]{.underline}. We
also know that [wars are **easy to start** and very **difficult to
stop,**]{.underline} much less "win" in an unambiguously convincing
fashion.

The Vietnam War -- or the "American War" as the Vietnamese
understandably call it -- lasted for 13 years and led to the U.S.'s
humiliating exit from Southeast Asia. Even though Vietnam undoubtedly
"won" the conflict, some 2-3 million Vietnamese died in the process. To
underline the pointlessness of all this carnage, Vietnam is now seen by
many grand strategists as a potentially useful ally against China ---
the new existential threat to democracy, American primacy and much else.

**[Pointless, avoidable blood-soaked tragedies never go out of
fashion]{.underline}**, it seems. One might have thought that we would
have learned some useful lessons from the "war to end all wars" -- World
War 1 -- or the increasingly fashionable, increasingly futile "wars of
choice" that have been undertaken by the Americans in particular.

It is not simply the fact that such [conflicts encourage other leaders
keen to use their military might to try and violently solve complex,
historically embedded political problems]{.underline} [that undermines
confidence in deterrence theory.]{.underline} On the contrary,
even [nuclear weapons]{.underline} [are re-entering the
lexicon]{.underline} [of great power posturing and even war
gaming]{.underline}, no doubt, [as leaders try to convince]{.underline}
their [counterparts]{.underline} elsewhere that [they aren't bluffing
about their possible use]{.underline}.

The **[most consequential example]{.underline}** of this possibility at
present [is]{.underline} in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**, where Russian
President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} is [threatening to use "tactical"
nuclear weapons]{.underline} in the increasingly unlikely event that
outside powers intervene or that he looks like losing the war.

[Part of what makes such threats credible is]{.underline} what Hugh
White, one of Australia's most prominent strategic commentators,
calls '[the balance of resolve']{.underline}; in this case, [the belief
that Putin is willing to risk an apocalyptic conflict and use nuclear
weapons against equally powerful opponents]{.underline}.

White argues that:

Any international order is defined ultimately by the issues on which the
strongest powers -- the great powers -- can convince one another they
are willing to go to war with one another over.'

He may be correct that [this has been the **case for the last couple of
hundred years**]{.underline}, or even the last couple of thousand,
according to some "realist" thinkers, [but that **doesn't make it** a
**desirable** condition]{.underline}. Hopefully, it doesn't make it
inevitable either, despite what the realist strategists may tell us.
Indeed, we must hope they are wrong because [**strategic standoffs**
**don't** usually **end well**]{.underline}. The [peaceful
disappearance]{.underline} [of the Soviet Union may be a historical
aberration]{.underline} in this regard and one that [Putin is determined
to avenge.]{.underline}

Given the consequences of what is euphemistically described by strategic
thinkers as a "nuclear exchange", we might expect that logic that
underpins such possibilities might be subject to more rigorous
examination and debate. But as is generally the way with military
matters and grand strategising, such issues are the preserve of
a coterie of specialists who seem immune to external influence or the
worries of mere mortals.

But one question we might usefully ask is: [**if nuclear weapons are
such decisive deterrents, why doesn't** everyone have one? Why shouldn't
**Iran have one**]{.underline}, to take a topical example, [as that
might have deterred the Israelis from launching]{.underline} yet another
assault on one of their neighbours.

[If the right to have nuclear weapons is judged on behaviour and
historical body counts, Israel]{.underline}, under Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[, is surely the last country that ought to
have any]{.underline} [because it is clearly the most likely to use
them.]{.underline} If Israel under his leadership is determined to stop
Iran getting one, a nuclear weapon ought to do the trick, no matter how
deeply buried Iran's bomb building facilities are.

No doubt, there are quite a few people who would think this was no bad
outcome, and well worth all the collateral damage being inflicted on
Iran's already impoverished people and infrastructure. Serves the
Iranian people right for not rising up and overthrowing an anachronistic
theocracy, no doubt. And yet, Netanyahu is also a reminder that
[**unscrupulous leaders** who **use war** and hatred **to maintain
power** can appear anywhere and prove difficult to get rid of,
too]{.underline}. 

For those countries that don't have nukes, these debates can seem a bit
detached from reality and something we can't really influence. But that
hasn't stopped our [own hardheaded realists]{.underline} from
[urging]{.underline} us [to]{.underline} [get ready to 'strengthen U.S.
extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline} and be ready to support nuclear
operations to restore deterrence should it fail'.

[Quite how you restore deterrence when you've just **vaporised** large
numbers of the purported enemy is an open question]{.underline}.
Probably [**not the moment** for a **rational calculation of strategic
options**]{.underline}, though. ["**Use them or lose
them"**]{.underline} might be the order of the day.

sofia

Russia's military action against [Ukraine]{.underline} has [renewed a
debate about the importance of nuclear weapons for the
alliance]{.underline}, particularly among its European members.

It is important to remember that [nuclear weapons are not
mentioned]{.underline} [in the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline} and
the designation of NATO as a nuclear alliance is a [relatively recent
phenomenon]{.underline} dating only from 2010. But it is [now deeply
entrenched in the alliance's strategic thinking]{.underline},
encapsulated in the mantra: "[as long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO
will remain a nuclear alliance".]{.underline}

The [problem]{.underline} with this is it effectively [closes the door
on thinking]{.underline} creatively [about ways]{.underline} to get to
the alliance's stated objective of creating "[a security environment for
a world without nuclear weapons".]{.underline} [Something that is
**essential**]{.underline}, not just for NATO, but **[for all of
humanity. ]{.underline}**

In light of the heightened threat of nuclear war, it would be a [grave
mistake for NATO's leaders to conclude that nuclear weapons are more
important than ever]{.underline} for Europe's defence.

The [alliance]{.underline} says it is [committed to creating a peaceful,
nuclear-weapon-free world]{.underline}, something that is in its
interest, as well as that of the rest of the world. So, NATO members
should be [pushing]{.underline} much harder [for]{.underline} further
reciprocal [bilateral reductions in US and Russian warhead
stockpiles]{.underline} [and]{.underline} working to [revive
multilateral nuclear disarmament talks at the United
Nations]{.underline}.

But [instead]{.underline}, they are [cleaving ever closer to nuclear
weapons and the flawed doctrine of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.
**[Deterrence is an unproven theory]{.underline}**, which its [adherents
claim has prevented nuclear conflict]{.underline}, but has [in
**reality** brought us **very close** to it on more than one
occasion]{.underline}.

Most notably it was the **[deterrence mindset]{.underline}** that
[led]{.underline} the [Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to install
nuclear missiles on Washington's doorstep in Cuba]{.underline} as a
counter to US missiles that were on Moscow's doorstep in Turkey. This
[led to the brinkmanship of the **Cuban Missile Crisis**]{.underline}
[during which]{.underline} it was -- in US Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's words -- [plain, dumb luck]{.underline} that [prevented
nuclear]{.underline} [war]{.underline}.

The US has deployed nuclear weapons in European countries since the
1950s. The logic then was that these weapons offset a Soviet numerical
advantage in conventional forces. Since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, followed by the entry into NATO of most former Warsaw Pact
members, as well as the former Soviet Baltic republics and four
successor states of the former non-aligned Yugoslavia, that strategic
landscape has transformed. Now it is [NATO]{.underline} that
[has]{.underline} the [conventional advantage over Russia and does not
need nuclear weapons in Europe.]{.underline}

Yet, [in the past year NATO has doubled down on its commitment to
nuclear]{.underline} [weapons]{.underline} with the US introducing a
[new, more powerful, nuclear bomb]{.underline} (the B61-12) and a new
nuclear capable stealth [fighter bomber]{.underline} (the F35A) to the
countries that currently host American weapons, Belgium, Germany, Italy,
The Netherlands and Türkiye (although the latter is yet to receive the
F35). There are also signs the US may be about to [return]{.underline}
these [weapons to]{.underline} one of its [bases]{.underline} in the UK.

[Russia]{.underline} has [used this as a **justification** to deploy
nuclear weapons to]{.underline} its ally and neighbour Belarus, which
borders NATO members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. An own goal for NATO
given the US weapons in Europe serve little practical military purpose.

[NATO insists]{.underline} the American nuclear [weapons
deployed]{.underline} in Europe [are permitted under the Nuclear
non-Proliferation Treaty]{.underline} (NPT) [while Russia's in Belarus
are not]{.underline}. But [many countries]{.underline} in the treaty
which do not have nuclear weapons [see this as a double
standard]{.underline}.

[If NATO wants to strengthen its security]{.underline} in an
increasingly uncertain world overshadowed by the threat of nuclear
conflict, [it needs to stop clinging to nuclear doctrine and change its
approach]{.underline}.

A [first step]{.underline} woul d be to [end the deployment of American
nuclear weapons in other NATO countries]{.underline}. It [would not
weaken the alliance]{.underline} one iota, [but]{.underline} would [send
a signal that the alliance is serious about reducing nuclear risks and
de-escalating nuclear tensions with Russia]{.underline}.

This should be [followed by the US and Russia engaging in a transparent
and reciprocal disarmament process,]{.underline} leading to [both
countries]{.underline} and NATO  [dropping]{.underline} their
[opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons]{.underline} (TPNW). This treaty, which complements the NPT,
came into force in 2021 and [already has nearly half of all countries as
signatories or parties]{.underline}.

NATO's nuclear-armed members, France, the UK and the US, have so far
been hostile to the treaty and put pressure on other countries not to
join it, and NATO's secretariat has taken the same approach. However,
some NATO members, including Belgium, Germany, Norway, and The
Netherlands, have tentatively engaged with it by observing its meetings
of states parties.

[The TPNW is the only treaty that bans all nuclear weapons-related
activity, and it offers a fair and verifiable pathway to a world without
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. But the failure of most NATO members to
engage with it suggests they are not taking the nuclear threat as
seriously as they should.

NATO claims being a member of the TPNW is incompatible with being a
member of the alliance, but this is a political argument not a legal
one. There is nothing in the treaty that prevents a state party from
being a member of a military alliance involving nuclear-armed states. It
only precludes them from taking part in nuclear weapons-related
activities.

There is also the precedent of many NATO members having joined the
treaties banning landmines and cluster munitions despite US opposition.
In other words, NATO has a tradition of accommodating differences of
opinion on what weapons are acceptable. 

[For an alliance that says it wants to create a security environment for
a nuclear-weapon-free world to double down on nuclear sharing shows
**confused strategic thinking**]{.underline}.

In order to make good on its commitment to work towards "a safer world
for all ... without nuclear weapons", [NATO needs to go back to its
roots in the Atlantic Treaty, wean itself off being a nuclear alliance
dependent on **outdated deterrence strategy.**]{.underline}

Introduction to Arctic Security Concerns

In recent years, [the Arctic has emerged as]{.underline} a [paramount
focus]{.underline} for [international security]{.underline} due to the
region\'s growing strategic and economic significance. As climate change
continues to melt polar ice caps, the Arctic is becoming more
accessible, providing new shipping routes and increasing access to
untapped natural resources. This newfound accessibility has heightened
geopolitical tensions, as nations vie for control and influence over
these critical areas. The UK\'s recent [initiatives to deploy artificial
intelligence (AI) for Arctic security highlight the **strategic
importance**]{.underline} they assign [to this region
amidst]{.underline} these [evolving challenges]{.underline}. With the
introduction of [AI]{.underline}, the UK aims to [better monitor hostile
activities, protect]{.underline} crucial [undersea infrastructure, and
**fortify security coop**]{.underline}eration [with]{.underline} its
[allies]{.underline}, particularly Norway. This approach not only
underscores the significance of [tech]{.underline}nological
[advancements in]{.underline} modern [security frameworks]{.underline}
but also [sets a precedent for other non-Arctic nations]{.underline}
keen on safeguarding their interests in the High North.

The Arctic\'s rising profile in global geopolitics is closely tied to
the strategic ambitions of key players, including Russia and China,
which view the region as pivotal for advancing their national interests.
The UK, while not an Arctic nation, has demonstrated its commitment to
this vital region through cooperative defense measures and technological
innovation, particularly with the deployment of AI. This technology aims
to enhance surveillance and operational response to potential threats,
addressing challenges posed by increased military activities and
environmental hazards. Additionally, collaborative efforts, such as the
new UK-Iceland tech partnership for Arctic surveillance, emphasize the
importance of international cooperation in tackling these security
concerns. This partnership is part of the broader strategy of joint
patrols with Norway, aimed at countering the aggressive maneuvers of
Russia\'s Northern Fleet. By investing in such measures, the UK not only
strengthens its defenses but also builds trust with its allies,
fostering a united front in maintaining stability in the Arctic.

Geopolitical Tensions in the Arctic

The Arctic region, long perceived as a remote and frozen expanse, has
rapidly emerged as a focal point of international geopolitical tensions.
With climate change accelerating the melting of ice caps, new shipping
routes are opening up, offering economically significant pathways that
have piqued global interest. Nations, mindful of these developments, are
eyeing the Arctic\'s untapped natural resources, sparking a potential
race for dominance in this once inaccessible territory. This race is not
just confined to regional players but includes global powers keen on
securing their share of the Arctic pie. Such intensified activity
underscores the emerging strategic importance of the Arctic amidst a
complex web of international relations.

In response to these evolving geopolitical dynamics in the Arctic, the
United Kingdom has taken proactive steps to safeguard its interests and
those of its allies. Deploying artificial intelligence technology is a
cornerstone of its strategy to bolster Arctic security. This move is
part of a broader initiative to monitor and mitigate threats posed by
hostile states. By enhancing surveillance capabilities, [AI technology
enables **more effective tracking** and response to potentially
aggressive activities]{.underline}, particularly [from
Russia]{.underline}, whose military maneuvers in the Arctic have been a
growing source of concern. Joint patrols with NATO allies like Norway
underscore the commitment to a cooperative security framework aimed at
maintaining stability in the region.

The geopolitical stakes in the Arctic are further complicated by
Russia\'s strategic maneuvers, which are seen as leveraging the region
to support broader geopolitical ambitions, including the funding of
conflict activities elsewhere, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Russia\'s establishment of a \"shadow fleet\" to support its operations
and the deployment of nuclear-powered icebreakers to open new maritime
routes exemplify this strategy. In response, the UK\'s AI initiative
aims to safeguard undersea infrastructure critical to international
communications and energy supplies, highlighting the multipronged nature
of threats faced in the Arctic environment.

Through partnerships with countries like Iceland, the UK is advancing
technological collaborations [focus]{.underline}ed [on deploying AI for
enhanced surveillance]{.underline} in the Arctic. This cooperative
approach not only [contributes to the **immediate need for
security**]{.underline} but also positions the UK as a [leading player
in pioneering tech]{.underline}nological solutions tailored for Arctic
challenges. Such bilateral and multilateral initiatives are vital in
[counter]{.underline}ing the probable **[escalation of
tensions]{.underline}** that resource competition in the Arctic is
likely to entail.

Europe\'s collective response to Arctic tensions is crystallized in the
form of stringent sanctions against Russia, targeting its military
technology and energy sectors. These measures are designed to curb
Russian ambitions in the Arctic, further intensified by concerns over
its military hardware stationed in the region. Furthermore, NATO\'s
establishment of a new Combined Air Operations Centre in Norway marks a
significant expansion of its defensive posture in the High North, aimed
at addressing the growing militarization of the Arctic space. This
strategic alignment underscores the cohesive effort required to confront
emerging threats head-on whilst ensuring sustainable peace in this
strategically critical area.

//DH

The U.S. Arctic interests have varied when considering its Arctic
policies and political actors\' discourse and actions towards the
Arctic, Alaska, and Greenland. However, there are three main interests
and themes throughout the U.S. Arctic rhetoric. The main themes that
have been consistent and proportionally larger than all the rest are
economic opportunities and military security. These [U.[S. Arctic
ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark} and interests both [[seek to benefit the
U.S.'s economic, political, and societal security in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region. Considering this U.S.'s
'protectionist' agenda in the Arctic, we can see that [[the U.S. heavily
benefits from Arctic involvement,]{.mark} while non-state actors, such
as Arctic inhabitants and Indigenous peoples, do not]{.underline}.
Repeatedly, throughout the discourse analysis, [there was a **veil**
placed over the [U.S.'s]{.mark}]{.underline} actions and [[inclusion of
Arctic communities]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is purposefully executed.
The veil placed over ["including and co-managing with the Arctic
communities"]{.underline} mean this aim [falls short and]{.underline}
thus it [is an **empty promise** by the majority of U.S.
politicians]{.underline}. As discovered in the discourse analysis,
[[this conceals the U.S.'s **real neocolonialist ambitions**]{.mark} and
capitalistic mentality towards the Arctic region.]{.underline}

As mentioned in the literature review, the U.S. has historically
prioritized economic security over both environmental and human
securities in the Arctic, and this continues to be the case (Silva,
2022). Many political elites in the U.S. have been wary of the U.S.
government and the presidential administration's motives and strategies
within the Arctic region (Hicks, 2007; Hossain, 2016; Sakakibara &
Ahtuangaruak, 2021; Kramer, 2022; Silva, 2022; Marlatt, 2022).
Furthermore, Arctic researchers claim that there is a negative
correlation between economic opportunities and human security, meaning
that the continued U.S. interest and prioritization of economic activity
and opportunities in the Arctic region, causes a decrease in human and
cultural security for Indigenous peoples and Arctic communities
(Filimonova, 2012; Pfaff, 2019; Arctic Energy Office, 2021).

For both Alaska and Greenland, the lack of prioritization and action to
include and promote visibility within the U.S. Arctic discourse shapes
the level of importance and seriousness of the agenda priority. The
[U.S. political actors' discourse about Alaska suggests that Arctic
inhabitants were prioritized, yet]{.underline} [when implementing
investment projects]{.underline} in natural recourse extraction, such as
the Willow Project or infrastructure developments like the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline, ['co-management and consideration' of Arctic inhabitants was
not exercised]{.underline}. In turn, [this severely hinders Alaskan
Arctic communities' human security.]{.underline} With a capitalistic
drive to continue to invest and take advantage of 'emerging' natural
resources due to the melting of permafrost, the socioeconomic effects on
the Arctic communities will be severe. [Pollutions, chemical spills from
mining, oil spills, ecological degradation, food shortages, issues with
species abundance in for hunting and fishing practices, cultural
traditions and language, and health security, are all human security
issues that are hindered due to a lack of prioritization and actionable
steps for prevention in the U.S. Arctic discourse]{.underline}
(Bjerregaard, 2001; Bjerregaard et al., 2004; Curtis et al., 2005;
Hicks, 2007; as cited in Lehti et al., 2009, Rosen & Thuringer, 2017 and
Carlin, 2019).

[[On an international scale, the U.S. Arctic rhetoric versus the
underlying meanings]{.mark}]{.underline} and discourse shape and
[[affect]{.mark} the [human security]{.mark} of]{.underline}
Greenlanders and [other Arctic nations [even more than that of the
Alaskan communities]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[as the U.S. is more
interested in protecting its own Arctic
inhabitants]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as was found in the discourse
analysis of Biden's National Strategy for the Arctic Region 2022, set
out in section 5.1.4. Given that the U.S. is one of the most powerful
states in the Arctic and a global hegemon, their actions and discourse
are being analyzed by other states to create their own policies and
Arctic strategies. [If other states see that [the U.S. acknowledges
human security concerns of Arctic inhabitants, but that they do not
implement these]{.mark}, prioritize, or follow through with their words,
[the discourse will lead other states to believe that human
security]{.mark} or other 'soft securities' **[are not as important as
hard securities.]{.mark}**]{.underline} We can already see this at work
as the U.S.'s current interests are based around prioritizing economic
and military security in the Arctic region.

The inhabitants of Greenland are even more vulnerable. [As the U.S.
continues to enter the Greenlandic economy indirectly through
neocolonialist back-dooring, there is no doubt the U.S. will try to do
this with other states in the Arctic]{.underline} (Nwachuku, 2016, p.).
With the increased influence the U.S. will have in Greenland as they
prepare for deeper cooperation with Denmark and Greenland, many scholars
fear that [Greenland could be the 'new' Alaska]{.underline} for the U.S.
(Rosen & Thuringer, 2017 and Carlin, 2019). According to the U.S.
political actors' discourse, Greenland is seen as economically and
militarily promising which will cause societal and environmental
repercussions that will harm and displace Greenland's inhabitants and
its surrounding maritime region (Rosen & Thuringer, 2017, p.10).

The [claims of]{.underline} promoting and [[prioritizing Arctic
Indigenous peoples **only seem to apply to Alaskans** and not those of
other Arctic states]{.mark}, considering how the U.S. political actors
discussed their interests in Greenland. [This shapes the discourse on
the human security of Arctic inhabitants]{.mark} outside of in the U.S.,
thus [raising concerns amongst other Arctic states regarding]{.mark}
potential [economic or military **opportunism** from the
U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [This signals the need for caution
when cooperating]{.underline} or when making investment deals [with the
U.S]{.underline}. in the Arctic region. As discovered in the findings
chapter, the U.S.'s top interests in the Arctic deal with economic or
military security gain, whereas, human security is and will be an
afterthought when cooperating with U.S. in the Arctic region. **[[The
veil the U.S. used of 'helping' and 'cooperating'
is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to the discourse, **[[a tactic to
'protect' the U.S.'s reputation, presence, and future in the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This insinuates that the [human security
and social impacts upon Arctic inhabitants will be at risk when their
nations are cooperating with the U.S.]{.underline}
