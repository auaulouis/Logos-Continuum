# K -- Blue Humanities -- DGHL

### Notes

**Explanation:**\
The theory of the K is that there is an innate connection between the
desire to have control over the blue (both the literal pigment blue, and
the more metaphorical oceanic territory and blue economic resources) and
that this desire is intrinsic to colonialism and leads to forms of
sovereign genocide.\
\
When the aff reads the typical "set col wrong" arguments you can mostly
no-link, because they don't answer the specificity of the K.\
\
Blue isn't an "FYI" in this instance, rather it points to desire to
control the arctic as UNIQUE in the area of colonialism, which means
even if they win that ontology/colonialism is malleable, you're winning
that BLUE DESIRES are not. Make them answer your specific claims or
lose.

This K is designed to be read as a one off or two off position. Don't
read this with a substantial number of other offs.\
\
understanding the theory of the kritik will be key to answering 2AC
arguments. All the 2AC cards in this file have answers in 1NC evidence,
you just need to draw them out.\
\
The humanism question: This K is NOT antihumanist, its post-humanist.
(see: the Wildersonian humanism bad cards in the 2AC)

There are two ways to read the K -- one as a Sharpe esque antiblackness
K and one as a blue humanities post colonialist K. The two
configurations are different shells in the 1NC configuration.

There are a variety of AFF answers in this file because there are lots
of ways this K can be deployed. It is up to you to decide which cards
matter depending on how the 1NC articulates its thesis. Not all of the
answers will be responsive to every version of the K.

[In 2009, Dutch visual artist Pieter Paul Pothoven traveled to
Afghanistan for seven weeks**, in search of lapis lazuli** and the
famous Sar-e-Sang mines.]{.underline} Funded by the Netherlands
Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture (Fonds BKVB) he
visited the mines for two days, which resulted in several series of
works over the past twelve years that use lapis lazuli both symbolically
and physically. 33 For Laguard (2010--15), Pothoven photographed five
cut and polished slabs of the lapis lazuli he purchased in Afghanistan,
near the Sar-e-Sang mines.34 The photographs show five different types
of lapis lazuli, out of the thirteen types the Sar-e-Sang mineworkers
differentiate.35 The bright blues of the lazurite mineral are marbled
with the white of the calcite and the light-golden pyrite, resulting in
images from "beyond the sea" that resemble drone shots of ocean waves
crashing into the shore (fig. 1). [Pothoven's series draw on the
**historical fascination** with the high-quality lapis lazuli from
Afghanistan and show the wide range of blues that can be extracted from
the mineral rock. His work is, moreover, indebted to the changing
sociocultural and material situation of late twentieth- and early
twentyfirst-century Afghanistan. The pieces of lapis lazuli Pothoven
bought in Afghanistan traveled to the Netherlands with the assistance of
the Dutch military forces, "shipped by the Dutch Embassy through Kamp
Holland (ISAF) in Tarin Kowt, Uruzgan, to the naval base in Amsterdam .
. . where Dutch East India Company (VOC) **ships were once
built**.]{.underline}"36 Laguard, as well as [**Pothoven's subsequent
series, would not have existed without the assistance of the Dutch
navy,** itself part of the 2001 imperialist invasion of Afghanistan by
US and allied Western forces. The ways in which Afghanistan has been
conceptualized since the nineteenth century are **closely connected to
imperial geopolitical agendas and the Orientalist paradigm that
underlies** the "war on terror."37 Pothoven's work attests to the
"asymmetric distribution of labor, power and wealth" and the connection
of the arts to the legacies of Western extractivism, but it ultimately
treads similar **blue colonial pathways** and, via his purchase of
stones and their subsequent voyage to Amsterdam, reiterates these
patterns.38 33. van Velzen, "DIG Interview"; at the time of writing,

the mine workers, who risk their lives in their daily journey up the
mountain to go into the belly of the mountain to blast, drill or cut out
its blue matter with very simple tools and in unsafe conditions."39 The
absence of blue and depiction of the empty mine is representative of the
dark side of the idolization of the color blue that Pothoven's work
draws attention to. T[he disruptive nature of Giotto's blue is doubled
as blue mountains and mines make way for the post-9/11 "geopolitical
fetishism" of the terror hiding in Afghan caves.40 In Absentia makes
visible the capitalist extraction of the lapis lazuli rock and the human
cost of ripping the blue out of the mountain, and the literal darkness
that has taken over Sar-e-Sang now that much of the lapis lazuli has
disappeared. Yet it also visualizes the imagined darkness of the cave in
the early twenty-first century. **The mountain, the cave, the rock, the
pigment, the ship, the navy, and the military are part of the blue
colonial threads that are woven of blue material and its remnants across
thousands of years.** Pothoven's work critiques the Western obsession
with the most expensive blue in the world and visualizes its increased
absence. Yet his work simultaneously affirms the continued appeal of
these deep blue shades and retraces the journeys of the lapis lazuli
rock in a post-9/11 world. His beautiful blues speak to the imagination

Afghan pigments. This shows that in our contemporary engagements with
the blue, it remains difficult or even impossible to escape its colonial
and material complexity. The colonial void of the blue in Pothoven's
lapis lazuli series, like Kristeva's absent referent in Giotto's
Scrovegni Chapel frescoes**, visualizes the disruptive nature of Western
blue desires**. Ultramarine unsettles and uncenters the dominant Western
subject and exposes the blue humanities to the potency of the blue
itself. Thinking with blue in the blue humanities via Kristeva and
Pothoven shows that blue cannot be equated with simply water, which also
always already "varies in viscosities, intensities and densities" and
exposes the blue humanities to this complexity.41]{.underline} [**The
rocky qualities of lapis lazuli are entangled with the seas, the
mountains, and the fabric of military naval dress in a blue figuration
that destabilizes Western blue desires,** further shown in a
material-semiotic analysis of indigo.]{.underline}42 Indigo and Royal
Blue Disruption Like ultramarine, indigo has long been a color of
disruption. As the European craving for lapis lazuli grew, so did the
pursuit of other sources of blue. Animal-derived blue from, for
instance, the punctured gland of the Murex trunculus sea snail, was
similarly expensive and required tens of thousands of snails for a
single kilogram of dye. The other popular blue, indigo, had long been
extracted from the native European "woad" (Isatis tinctoria). But with
the discovery of Indian-grown indigo (Indigofera tinctoria)---the plant
used to dye British naval uniforms---the British had eyes on a more
versatile and colorfast dye. Throughout the medieval period, European
monarchies had attempted to block the trade of Indian indigo in order to
protect the economic stability of the local woad
production[.]{.underline} Indigo became colloquially known as the
Devil's Dye, in opposition to the godly ultramarine. But once the
Portuguese, the Dutch, and then the British established maritime
connections between Europe and Asia, indigo was imported in such vast
quantities that woad prices inevitably dropped[. In the seventeenth
century, indigo emerged as the dominant blue of the modern world, and by
the eighteenth century, **indigo production had become inextricably
entwined with the transatlantic slave trade**, further expanding
colonial blue pathways.43 Motivated by the widening market for indigo,
the British invested in the creation of large-scale plantations in the
New World in order to expand indigo production and increase the empire's
wealth. The extensive use of slave labor on large plantations on
occupied lands in, for instance, Jamaica and South Carolina meant that
even with the added cost of transporting indigo back to Europe, British
merchants could keep the price of indigo so low that European woad could
no longer compete. Indigo became the blue that would make the British
Empire wealthier than it had ever been. This blue wealth 41. Blackmore

lives, whose bodies were used to grow indigo and many of whom died as
they were forced to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Indigo, along with ivory,
pepper, and other commodities, is also called the "hidden half" of the
Atlantic slave trade, as people were traded for lengths of indigo-dyed
cloth.44 After the American Revolution in the late eighteenth century,
the British lost access to cheap American-grown indigo and moved their
production to India, expanding the British Empire eastward by colonizing
Bengal and erecting indigo plantations on the lands of local farmers.
Recently returned to India from South Africa, Maha¯ tma¯ Gandhi was
called by freedom fighters to lead the first Champaran Satyagraha
movement in Bihar in 1917, also known as the Indigo Revolution.45 As
Vandana Shiva notes, the movement for Indian independence grew from the
"movement of peasants against the forced cultivation of indigo" and the
"movements of non-cooperation \[that\] started wherever the British
tried to tax the lands of the peasant and the homes of the people."46
Along with salt, the indigo plant became a symbol for noncooperative
resistance against British colonial rule. Like the disruptive nature of
ultramarine, indigo ignited the movement for freedom from British rule
and their continued exploitation of the earth, seas, and people through
blue colonialisms]{.underline}

"Going green" or "living green" often stands for adopting a zero-waste
and sustain- able lifestyle, connecting color to aesthetics and, more
often than not, to a more digest- ible type of capitalist consumerism.
Green has long been synonymous with nature and ecology and a preferred
descriptor for sustainability. In Prismatic Ecologies, Jeffrey Jerome
Cohen writes that "green dominates our thinking about ecology like no
other, as if the color were the only organic hue, a blazon for nature
itself."6 Developing a more expansive "prismatic ecology," Cohen
decentralizes green from its environmental throne: "Such a colorful
ascription begs the question of exactly what mode of being we are
attempting to sustain, and at what environmental cost."7 Like green,
blue has been increasingly pres- ent in institutional and
intergovernmental discourse as an adjective to draw attention to
potential economic development of bodies of water.8 These color changes
incite me to question what happens when green becomes blue: [What
exactly is and can blue be? How can we think beyond a simplistic
equation of blue with water, oceans, and seas, to investigate what
thinking with blue means in the blue humanities?9 Inspired by Donna
Haraway, it matters what colors color colors; how blues blue blues.10
Reckoning with the coloniality of blue informs its potential for present
and future blue endeavors. Untangling colonial blues as well as the
anticolonial resistance this color encourages, blue shows it- self as a
color that always already resists simplistic signiﬁcation.]{.underline}
The polyvocal theoretical currents that are thought-with in the blue
humanities build on the expansive nature of environmental cultural
thought and the genealogies of aquatic scholarship. Drawing on Donna
Haraway's "situated knowledges" and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa's
"thinking-with that resists the individualization of thinking," the blue
humanities can be thought of as enacting a "thinking-with-many," moving
from ﬁelds of thought to seas of circulation.11 The many that inform the
blue humanities, and particularly the analysis of aquatic colonial
undercurrents, include insights from Epeli Hau'ofa, Paul Gilroy, Kamau
Brathwaite, Elizabeth DeLoughrey, Édouard Glissant, Marcus Rediker,
Alice te Punga Somerville, Kerry Bystrom, Isabel Hofmeyr, Stefan
Helmreich, Hester Blum, Steve Mentz, Margaret Cohen, Peter Steinberg,
Kimberley Peters, Cecilia Åsberg, Laura Ingersoll, Stacy Alaimo, Ann
Elias, Christina Sharpe, Craig Santos Perez, Laura Winkiel, Astrida
Neimanis, and Melody Jue, with-many-more.12 Their work and the various
edited collections and special issues that have evoked the "blue
humanities," "critical ocean studies," "hydro-criticism," and "liquid
ecologies," address the numerous beginnings of the aquatic humanities
before and beyond the articulation of the blue humanities.13 Neimanis's
assertion that "we are all bodies of water" and Te Punga Somerville's
foregrounding of the long genealogy of Indigenous oceanic kinship add an
expansive materiality to Stacy Alaimo's consideration of human- ity's
"aquatic ancestors" and our trans-corporeal "kinship with the seas."14
These discussions prove the need for the blue humanities to [address the
continuation of the watery beyond continental boundaries via a
"transoceanic imaginary"]{.underline} and a "hydroco- lonial" approach
to salty, brackish, and fresh water.15 Expanding the environmental
humanities to the realm of the blue then invokes the question: What
exactly does thinking with blue add to these already existent aquatic
and oceanic discourses? And what does it mean to do the blue humanities
and [consider the blue not just as symbol but as material-semiotic
actant or figuration?16 In this essay I develop an analysis of the color
blue through its colonial materiality to argue that in the blue
humanities blue unmoors and loosens the anchor of Western colonial
desire.]{.underline}17 Like the oceanic "violet-black" depths Alaimo
calls upon to "understand the water of the abyssal zone as something
rather than nothing," [the blue puts the colonial to sea and surfaces
its material significance.]{.underline}18 I analyze the work of Dutch
visual artist Pieter Paul Pothoven and the poetic performance of
Aotearoa New Zealand poet Selina Tusi- tala Marsh to show how the blue
always already asserts itself and acts to resurface [and subvert
transoceanic colonial connections. This essay aims to unpack the
coloniality of blues---including indigo, ultramarine, and royal
blue---in conversation with the work of two contemporary artists to show
how the color blue acts in]{.underline} the world---materially,
socially, economically, and culturally---via the dynamic work it does in
the blue humani- ties, "[in the wake" of colonial desire]{.underline}.19
Blue Colonialisms and Ultramarine beyond the Sea Navy blue is not the
only shade of blue with a captivating material history and colo- nial
reverberations. The histories of several blues can be traced back to
early capitalist trade and imperial expansions across the seas. For a
long time, the most beautiful blue in the world was widely considered to
be ultramarine, also named true blue or, accord- ing to the fourteenth
century Italian painter Cennino Cennini, "the most perfect of all
colours."20 The ultramarine pigment is mostly composed of the blue
mineral lazurite, which is the main component of the lapis lazuli
mineral stone (a "stone from the sky": lapis is Latin for "stone,"
lazuli came to Latin via the Arabic ﻻﺯﻭﺭﺩ , which came via the Persian
ﻻﺟﻮﺭﺩ , meaning "sky" or "heaven"). It owes its deep blue shade to a
mixture of minerals---lazurite, silicates, and iron pyrite---and covers
a wide range of shades "from a deep, almost violet blue, through the
royal blue of the gem quality to light blue, a tur- quoise and finally
fewer pieces of brilliant green."21 This means that natural ultrama-
rine is never an entirely uniform shade of blue. The most high-quality
shades contain a high percentage of lazurite, giving it a bright, rich,
and warm blue tone. To extract natural ultramarine from ground lapis
lazuli is incredibly labor inten- sive. The process involves grinding
stones to a fine powder and mixing it with wax, resin, and linseed oil:
This mass, usually wrapped in a cloth, was left to sit for several
weeks, after which it was kneaded in rain water or a diluted solution of
lye. The blue particles dispersed into the liquid, while the impurities
remained in the mass. This process was usually repeated several times,
with each successive extraction generating a lower quality pigment. The
final extraction---consisting largely of colourless material, and a few
small blue particles---was known as ultramarine ash.22 The high cost of
the imported raw material, combined with the laborious process to
produce a high-quality pigment, meant that for a long time ultramarine
was at least as expensive as gold. The deep blue of ultramarine has
therefore long been a symbol of extravagance and luxury. The trade of
lapis lazuli dates to at least the Mesopotamian Late Ubaid period, circa
3500 BCE, "probably the first moment that man had sufficient wealth and
leisure to begin the quest for luxuries."23 Our current knowledge of the
his- tory of ultramarine dates to the fifth-century murals in Nisa
(Turkmenistan) and ex- tends into the twenty-first century. In March
2001, the sixth-century Bamiyan Buddha statues were declared false idols
by the Taliban government in Afghanistan and blown up with dynamite.
Once upon a time, the two Buddhas had been covered in precious stones
and ultramarine and carmine robes. In his travel report, Dà Táng X ı- yù
Jì 大唐西域 記 (Great Tang Records on the Western Region), Chinese monk
Xuanzang 玄奘 describes his visit to Bamiyan circa 629--645, as he makes
a detour on his way to India in order to see the giant sculptures: To
the north-east of the royal city there is a mountain, on the declivity
of which is placed a stone figure of Buddha, erect, in height 140 or 150
feet. Its golden hues sparkle on every side, and its precious ornaments
dazzle the eyes by their brightness. To the east of this spot there is a
standing figure of Sâkya Buddha, made of metallic stone (teou-shih) in
height 100 feet. It has been cast in different parts and joined
together, and thus placed in a complete form as it stands.24 The
ultramarine pigment used for the robes of the smaller Buddha statue
likely came from the nearby mines in the Blue Mountain (Koh-e-Laguard).
The mines in the Sar-e- Sang valley (the "Place of the Stone") in the
Badakhsan mountains in northeastern Afghanistan were the main supply for
European and Persian ultramarine up until 1830.25 Afghan ultramarine was
most extensively desired in Europe in the fourteenth to sixteenth
centuries, when it was transported from East to West along the famous
Silk Route from Afghanistan to Syria and across the Mediterranean Sea
into Europe. This journey remains embedded in its name. Ultramarine, in
Latin, means "beyond the sea." It refers to the voyage beyond the
Mediterranean Sea that European traders had to take to obtain the
pigment, but also signifies its superlative blueness---the most blue,
more blue than the sea---so blue that every artist in the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries aspired to use it. In Bluets (2009),
her autobiographical prose-poetic ode to the color blue, Maggie Nelson
writes that ultramarine "had to be made holy, by the wicked logic that
renders the expensive sacred."26 In the Middle Ages, Afghan lapis lazuli
was so expensive that painters could only use it sparingly, dependent on
the wealth of their patrons. To not waste its extravagance on unworthy
subjects, only the most highly regarded, most holy subjects in Western
Christian art were afforded the deep blue pigment. Ultramarine's
otherworldly cost and provenance could only be justified by restricting
its use to honor the otherworldly divinity of the Virgin Mary. The blue
robes that Mary wears in Giotto's Lamentation (Scrovegni Chapel, 1306),
for instance, are painted in ultramarine blue, a tra- dition that would
continue for centuries and would solidify the narrative connection
between blue and otherworldly riches. The ultramarine blue of Giotto's
work and in particular his depiction of the life of Christ and Mary in
the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, Italy, has challenged theorists and asks
us to consider: What effect does the perceived extravagance of the color
blue have on its signification and identification? n "Giotto's Joy"
(1980), French feminist philosopher Julia Kristeva writes that the
overwhelming colors used in Giotto's frescoes, and in particular the
overwhelming blues, translate "instinctual drives into colored
surface."27 Kristeva's feminist psychoanalytical analysis draws on color
perception theory and infant vision development to argue that [blue has
a quality beyond identity: "The perception of blue entails not
identifying the ob- ject; that blue is, precisely, on this side of or
beyond the object's fixed form; that it is the zone where phenomenal
identity vanishes." On the basis of André Broca's paradox that "to see a
blue light, you must not look directly at it" and the idea that infants
do not de- velop "centered vision---the identification of objects,
including one's own image," or an 'ideal-I,' until after the development
of color perception, Kristeva argues that blue always escapes
identification. Blue, with its short wavelengths, is even "earlier to
appear" in the vision of the infant child than any other color.28
Feminist visual art theorist Barbara Bolt explains Kristeva's
description of seeing Giotto's blue as the "experience of the (Lacanian)
Real erupting into and disrupting signification. . . . Colour is
destabilizing."29 Kristeva writes, "All colors, but blue in particular,
would have a noncentered or decentering effect, lessening both object
identification and phenomenal fixation. They thereby return the subject
to the archaic moment of its dialectic, that is, before the fixed,
specular 'I,' but while in the process of becoming this 'I' by breaking
away from instinctual, biological (and also maternal) dependence."30
Kristeva's analysis of Giotto's disruptive blue enforces a
material-semiotic response that goes beyond symbolic representation.
Giotto's blue is more than a symbol of otherworldly wealth, more than
paint on the ceiling; it entangles viewer and pigment, and uncenters
human-subjectivity to the more-than-human materiality of the blue and
its origins beyond the seas. When ultramarine and indigo meet, they
destabilize the idea that expansive wealth and obtaining new minerals
and materials across the seas is a universal sign of linear progress.
Kristeva's viewer "enters into the semidarkness of the Arena Chapel . .
. struck by the light that is generated, catching the eye because of the
colour blue."31 He walks into the Scrovegni Chapel as a Western subject,
a humanist I, overwhelmed with his visions of control over the natural
wealth of the world, and loses \[themselves\]~~himself~~ just by looking
at the bright color pigment on the walls. If, following Bolt and
Kristeva, the color blue indeed disrupts, decenters, and destabilizes,
what does this mean for the way it is em- ployed in the blue humanities?
The unruly presence of Giotto's brilliant blues reinforces the West's
economic and political force and legacies of extractive violence but
simulta- neously exposes its limits. The materiality of blue, as
otherworldly-pigment-beyond-the- sea, foregrounds the coloniality of its
past, but like in Sharpe's "wake work," "the past that is not the past
reappears, always, to rupture the present."32 Narrating the colonial
histories of Giotto's blue and ultramarine shows that blue unmoors
simplistic significa- tion and acts to disrupt a colonial logic of
extraction.]{.underline}

[What remains of bodies once they turn blue?]{.underline} In life, not
in death. When the colour of the blood running through your veins is no
longer red but blue. When you breathe out blue? When the stench of
cruelty of your masters in the form of your sweat and blood in indigo
vats might be the only familiar smells to you; the vats the only land
you know, as you continue to inhale and exhale more blue. When these
rancid, claustrophobic, incarcerating vats are the land you are coerced
to feel familiar with? When the limits of your body blurred with those
of vats so that you no longer know where your body ends and where the
vats begin? Or where the blue begins and ends? [How do we begin to
theorize blue blood, blue lungs, blue fingers, the blue stuck underneath
the nails, the blue breath that stretched Black and brown bodies across
the four continents?]{.underline} I want to think about how we can read
for extensions of these bodies in Divakaruni\'s poem about blue lungs
and breaths of Bengali peasants to the already-always blue hands of the
unborn, already enslaved child (Sharpe, 2016; Dash, 1991) to land that
too turned blue (and red) from the indigo seeds that were unethically
and forcefully thrust deep into its heart? The blue was grown on all
four continents with European masters and colonisers raping the land,
the women, enslaving Black people, and starving Black and brown
colonized people into (strategic) submission. In this chapter, I argue
that the legacy of colour blue needs to attend to racial, colonial and
imperial violence which produced it. I argue that attending to the
violence of blue means thinking about colonialism from British Raj to
the Americas; that it means thinking about slavery and the hierarchy of
labour conditions produced through transnational travels of blue. Once
again, this means bringing unlikely, seemingly unconnected spaces
together in a conversation. [Blue coloured the four
continents]{.underline}. And in this chapter, I try to hold onto its
trace to understand the intimacies of the four continents produced
through colour. In order to make clear why I stopped at blue lungs and
fingers, I need to take a brief detour and talk about 211 some critical
Black feminist and decolonial works that read marks on bodies within a
context of systems of domination. For instance, in her book, In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being, Black American feminist scholar, Christina
Sharpe (2016) argues an extended meditation on slavery and its afterlife
which she calls \"wake work\". I have engaged with wake work as an
analytic, method and ethics of engaging with resilient Black life in my
chapter on Theoretical Framework.119 Some of the key constellations of
the text include the ship, the hold, and the weather through which she
maps the co-ordinates of Black life despite death, as Sharpe puts it
(p.20). I have found myself pausing on her discussion of the ship
several times, and write about it here not to (perhaps once again)
present Black life as one that is always slipping, always on the ebb of
(normative) life, but to think through a mark, a taped piece of paper
that becomes a site, or rather, a modality, of imprinting on Black flesh
through which Black life is often made visible (to non-Black people like
myself). I also discuss this to illustrate that these markings have a
history. Sharpe discusses a photograph she comes upon in her archival
work looking through images of a catastrophic earthquake, of a little
Haitian girl who, injured, with a wound on her face, is lying on a
stretcher with an ice pack under her head. What struck Sharpe (and the
readers) about this photograph is a piece of transparent tape on her
forehead, with the word \"Ship\" written on it. Sharpe contextualizes
her discussion of this photograph, and the \'mark,\' within a
\"semiotics of the slave ship\" (p. 21). She discusses Zong, a slave
ship which brought enslaved African people from the West coast of Africa
to Jamaica in 1781, and deliberately drowned 132 people (or 140 or 142,
as Sharpe points out) en route due to lack of water on board, and for
filing insurance claims since no insurance money would have been paid
had these African people died of \"natural death\".120 When Sharpe comes
upon that photograph of the little Black girl, she cannot look at that
image outside the history of slavery and present of Black incarceration
in a police-plantation state of Haiti; she could not analyze the word
Ship on the girl\'s forehead outside of the marks that were burnt into
flesh of abducted Africans before they were huddled onto slave ships
(48- 49); she could not analyze it outside Zong, outside of other slave
ships and the Middle 119 As I have said in my Theoretical Framework as
well, wake work is more than just an analytic. Sharpe argue for it as an
ontology of Black life as well, something which I have respectfully
stayed away from employing in my work as a non-Black scholar. 120 As
Sharpe 212 Passage, and the Atlantic on whose bed are buried uncountable
African people in the 400 years of slavery. Sharpe writes: Is Ship a
proper name? A destination? An imperative? A signifier of the
im/possibility of Black life under the conditions of what, Stephanie
Smallwood tells us, \"would become an enduring project in the modern
Western world \'of\] probing the limits up to which it is possible to
discipline the body without extinguishing the life within\" (Smallwood
2008, 35-36)? Is Ship a reminder and/or remainder of the Middle Passage,
of the difference between life and death? Of those other Haitians in
crisis sometimes called boat people? Or is Ship a reminder and/or
remainder of the ongoing migrant and refugee crisis unfolding in the
Mediterranean Sea and the Indian and Atlantic Oceans? Given how visual
and literary culture evoke and invoke the Middle Passage with such
deliberate and reflexive dysgraphic unseeing, I cannot help but
extrapolate. (p. 46) Sharpe also highlights the other ways in which
Blackness circulates through the figures of the captive, migrant, and
refugee in her reading of the word Ship. Living Black life is performing
wake work, always in an intimate relationship with death in the world
because Blackness and Black people are constantly denied life. Once
again, it is important for me to reiterate that I do not discuss this
image to resign Black life to terror and death. Taking cues from
Sharpe\'s scholarship, I want to question how we can make sense of the
blue lungs, blue fingers/nails, blue unborness (Dash, 1991), [blue blood
and blue breaths]{.underline} that [marked the lands of Indigenous
peoples as coerced into settlement]{.underline} [by Black and brown
hands across the Empire, and flesh and skins of Black and brown
people]{.underline} as it spanned the whole of European and American
Empires. As a non-Black and non-Indigenous person looking at the image
in Sharpe's book I am trying to actively think about the \"ethical
demands on the viewer,\" (Sharpe, p. 51) and I would add, of the reader
here. The question of how to be ethical and responsible when
encountering the little Black girl, about whom we know nothing more,
none of the humanizing co-ordinates outside of the narrative of
earthquake (that always seemingly happen by force of nature and devour
Black and brown people) and aids agency, in the archive continues to
stay with me. It is a struggle to even become aware of my orientation to
Black lives in these moments. I am working with the ethic that we
non-Black people have a responsibility of treating with care (and
attention to complicity in anti-Blackness) this becoming of the Haitian
girl into a ship. 213 I write this with an understanding that Black
fungibility is not the same as the multitude of labouring Bengali
peasants I write about here. Black fungibility, as Tiffany King (2014)
argues drawing upon Black feminist scholars like Saidiya Hartman and
Hortense Spillers, is a "key analytic for thinking about Blackness and
settler colonialism in White settler nation-states". She writes: The
space making practices of settler colonialism require the production of
Black flesh as a fungible form of property, not just as a form of labor.
In Scenes of Subjection, Saidiya Hartman argues that the enslaved embody
the abstract "interchangeability and replaceability" that is endemic to
the commodity (Hartman, 1997, p. 21). [Beyond, the captive body's use as
labor, the Black body has a figurative and metaphorical value that
extends into the realm of the discursive and symbolic. (n.p) In pointing
out some instances of how imperial, colonial and racial processes
undergirding the life of natural indigo entangled the lives of enslaved
Africans and colonized Bengali peasants,]{.underline} I am not looking
for drawing any comparisons for there are no one-dimensional, easily
graspable, readily available units that can be compared here.121 I am
also trying to be careful that I do not make the argument that their
labour is what made them similar or even comparable to each other. What
I want to pay attention to in this chapter is how the [blue moved around
the globe, marking bodies and consolidating vertical and horizontal
hierarchies of the human]{.underline}. I attended to Black fungibility
because Blackness was and remains the most dehumanized as Sylvia Wynter,
Christina Sharpe, Saidiya Hartman and other Black scholars I have
discussed in my Theoretical Framework have noted. In order to talk about
[dehumanizing of Bengali peasants]{.underline}, to take into account the
resistance against this dehumanizing, I wanted to signal Black
fungibility as the first and core site of historical and ongoing
practices of dehumanizing. Colour has been an important site for how we
can \"approach anew the question of cultural exchange, violence and
resistance,\" notes Natasha Eaton (2013), a scholar of Art History. This
is certainly true for indigo for it has generated so much fascination,
hatred, oppression, but also, revolutions. The politics of indigo has
made it into a malevolent colour, making Empire stick together through
the blood of variously colonized peoples, and those enslaved and brought
to continental America, to the Caribbean, to South America, and to the
121 Please see my Theoretical Framework on discussion of politics of
Black flesh. 214 ryots (small land-owning peasants) of Bengal, Bihar,
and Orissa and everywhere else where Europeans went in search of land,
labour and other resources. I follow this trajectory of indigo to
reflect upon how [white **settler colonialism, enslavement of Africans
and colonial**/imperial domination across Asia and Africa **constituted
the global power through which indigo was** made into such an important
actant on world stage and i**ntegral to relations of white domination
and Black and brown subordination everywhere** until early 20th century
when synthetic indigo in Germany and elsewhere finally ended this
coercion to grow indigo.]{.underline} In this chapter, I hold onto blue
to make sense of seemingly disjointed spaces, temporalities and people
which indigo brought into often intimate, and always asymmetrical
encounters. I bring together two differently colonized spatial sites of
enactment of racial violence, South Carolina and Bengal by analysing two
important cultural texts of resistance. The first one is a mid-19th
century Bengali protest play that explicated the violence of colonizing
indigo planters and the resistance of the peasants, called Neel Darpan.
The title of the Bengali play means, "Indigo mirror" in its English
translation, the mirror being a "magic mirror which reflects two faces:
the face of the tyrant, and the face of the aggrieved victim of tyranny"
(Pradhan, date unknown). It reflects the harsh reality of the
ordinariness and everydayness of cruelty of the East India Company and
the accompanying British Raj, and also makes an attempt at capturing the
violence against but also the resistance of the colonized (though more
so of the coerced Bengali landlords rather than that of ryots or the
peasants themselves). This play is the focus of my analysis and I
examine it to think about anticolonial resistance of colonized Bengali
people, but also, and more importantly, to pause on how these discourses
of resistance could also work toward strengthening colonial and native
elites in power, and in turn supporting the rule of white masters. I
discuss the play in more detail later on in this chapter, but want to
point out here too that Neel Darpan is not an infallible example of a
radical anticolonial play that should be emulated in designing
discourses of resistance and freedom. The play is problematic in how it
centers the bodies of class and caste privileged landowning (zamindar)
men rather than the ryots and those landless peasants who were Muslims
and/or Dalit and had lived under the tyranny of these landlords even
before British colonial relations were consolidated in Bengal. I have
come to believe that it is precisely the problematic nature of the play
that makes it more important to analyze if our goal is to think about
questions of complicity in colonialism 215 here and there even as
injured colonized subjects of history. What can be perceived as failure,
I believe and argue, is pedagogically more important for learning to
resist better than trying to live or emulate some previous example of
resistance that left the landless/low caste/Dalit/Muslim subaltern
people as silent and vestigial. In this chapter, I also want to reflect
upon the conversation that can be facilitated between Neel Darpan and
Daughters of the Dust, a 1991 independent film by Black filmmaker and
novelist, Julie Dash. The film is set in early 20th century Dawtuh
Island, located on the Sea Islands off the South Carolina coast where
thousands of Africans had been enslaved during the last three quarters
of 18th century. Set in 1902, the film is a story of three generation of
Gullah women whose hands were stained blue from growing indigo on
plantations. Just as in Neel Darpan, indigo is the impetus for the
entire film, but centers enslaved (and free) Black women of past,
present and future instead of landlords and relatively class and caste
privileged ryots. It's also a woman-centered narrative that disrupts the
linearity of time by indicating a future for previously enslaved Black
people (through the figure of the unborn daughter). My choice to stage
and facilitate a discussion between two literal and textual spaces that
do not make any obvious references to each other might beget the
question of why this should and can be done. To begin to answer this
question, I note that I have known of Neel Darpan for much longer than I
have known about Indigenous peoples and enslaved Black people in the New
World who were also coerced into growing indigo. My earliest knowledge
about indigo came from stories told by my Bengali Muslim mother who
probably knows (of) indigo more intimately than I ever will. She has
heard more stories and have seen indigo fields and grew up playing in
and around neel kuthi, or blue walled houses built by European planters
during initial days of indigo trade in a small city of Narayanganj,
outside of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where she lived with her large
working-class family and was one of the nine children of factory
workers. Neither of us are certain about who in our families grew indigo
but considering the fact that my mother's family comes from the Nadia
district of East Bengal (in present-day India) and Bangladesh (part of
India until 1947 and then Pakistan until 1971), and were among the
poorest of Hindu peasants who converted to Ismailism122 in 122 Ismailism
is a branch of Shi\'i Islam. While scholarly studies into conversion of
Hindus to Ismailism in South Asia have yet to be carried out
systematically in terms of caste, hearing some stories from 100s of
years ago 216 17th- to 18th centuries to escape caste relations under
Hinduism that were intimately tied to their depressed class and caste
positions, it is likely that they saw themselves reflected in the
anticolonial struggles of which Neel Darpan is a part. We grew up
hearing stories from my mother, grandparents and aunties about brave men
and women who spent their lives struggling against the brutal realities
of the East India Company rule in India. From stories of getting
tortured and killed by British sahibs to a fable of an old woman who fed
those "evil sahibs" of the East India Company poisoned roti (bread),
tales of revolutionaries who fought the sahibs who would beat us for
land, for labour, and our women; in fact, for our very souls. And for
colours, which, in these stories, grew by \'magic\' in the soil. [This
magic sent blue poison deep into the veins and blood of my ancestors.
They grew poison and died in the process and all of this so that
Europeans and Americans could wear blue clothes! I have been very angry
thinking about the millions of deaths of Black and brown people and
their futures around the world just so there can be blue uniforms, gowns
and drapes. Initially, I planned to only write about European planters
and the East India Company's violence against the Bengali peasants, and
focus on colonizer-colonized, but also the hierarchical relations
amongst the colonized. However, once I began to read up more widely on
the history of indigo --the transnationality of its reach, and the
poison it infused not only in brown bodies but also how it stained Black
flesh --it became increasingly difficult to not contextualize indigo
within the context of enslavement and deaths of Black
people.]{.underline} Without thinking about the blue-stained hands of
women in Nana Peazant's family in Dash's film --presented as both, a
poetics of slavery and resistance --thinking about indigo in Bengal
(only) seemed to be just a small piece of the story. Living in North
America, talking about colonial violence unleashed by the British
planters on Bengalis prompted me to unforget how I live where I now
live, and how integral it is to my narratives to pay attention to the
colour now surviving in Gujarati language, and from knowledge passed
down in family and the larger community, I know that most of us
converted to Ismailism to escape caste tyranny. I understand my
ancestors as belonging to Chamar caste of Dalit people. However, it is a
subject position which I do not claim today given that among Ismailis,
caste hierarchies are disavowed and for generations now we have grown up
without knowing casteist violence. I now understand myself to be a
privileged caste person in diaspora and hold myself complicit in
upholding caste hierarchies. This is despite the fact that caste
definitely shows in our surnames, whether it be my adopted mid-caste
surname of Patel or my extended family\'s surname of Kachra which means
garbage in Hindi/Urdu. It was a surname which they think marked their
means of living as generations of garbage collectors at the time of
conversion to Islam/Ismailism. I, however, do not know how or why we
changed our paternal last name or what it actually was before Patel or
even how this name change was possible in a very casteist South Asia. I
have yet to examine my own family histories and of caste relations among
Ismailis of earlier centuries. 217 which marked bodies of other
colonized and enslaved peoples of the New World. For a long time now,
because of the stories I grew up with, I have known that blue killed.
What I realize only more recently is that **[blue is an archive in
itself]{.underline}**. So much has happened out of the blue; so much
violence has come out of the blue. Indigo blue is an archive that has
brought the peasants whose stories I grew up hearing together with
enslaved and Indigenous peoples in the New World. This chapter is a
small attempt at reading that vast, transnational archive of blue
through the play and the film. Bringing these texts and spaces into
conversation has been difficult for me because my academic training, as
I have stated in my introductory chapter, has prepared me to hold onto
mostly clear-cut boundaries of fields, theories, temporalities, and
geographies. Attempting to draw these connections when there is no
linear narrative to present in easily consumable bits is a daunting
task. Again and again I would give up on writing this chapter because
tracing the legacies and connections left in the wake of blue has been
difficult since the boundaries around different archives have been kept
strictly segregated.123 But [labour exploitation, imperialism,
colonialism and slavery are all encoded in the sign of
indigo]{.underline} but so is the resistance of the ryots, of the
enslaved and of other colonized peoples coerced into growing indigo for
Europe and later, America. The colonized people in Neel Darpan and Nana
Peazant\'s family in Daughter of the Dust are already in conversation
with each other even if the conversations are placed in different
spatio-temporal coordinates. Linking imperialism in India with colonial
and racial violence of the New World despite the vast geographical and
chronological divide is actually needed because as I have argued in
another chapter, the colonizers of the New World who were also the
Master of the stolen and enslaved people, later came to India as East
India Company officials, as planters, as private business holders,
adventurers and soldiers. Reading these texts in relation to each other
provides an analytical framework that decolonizes the kinds of archival
and representational separations that constitute and reproduce
present-day colonial discontinuities and "afterlives of slavery"
(Hartman, 1997). Moreover, I take heed from Gyandera Pandey's (2008)
instruction in his editorial on bringing changing modes of
disenfranchisement in South Asia and the US into conversation with each
other. He writes: 123 I have discussed this in more detail in my chapter
on methodology. I am also very grateful to Lisa Lowe's (2006, 2015) work
for encouraging me to think through the archival boundaries. 218 The
juxtaposition of different bodies of scholarship and differing debates
should help to bring about a new awareness, not only of shared histories
and shared struggles in the making of the modern world, but of
particularities and facets of our different histories and societal
conditions that we have simply assumed as being well understood, and
hence taken for granted. (p. 272) From India to Arabia to Europe and
Africa and back to India, indigo moved along trade routes, solidifying
human hierarchies of colonizers, colonized, Masters, slaves,
planters/colonizers, and the colonized/peasants. This chapter is not an
effort at writing a better or more complete story of indigo. However, it
is an effort at expanding the analytical frames within which scholars of
South Asia and British Empire have looked at indigo production in
Bengal. I want to place the stories of indigo I know with the ones I am
beginning to learn about. I try to do that without losing the
specificities of the forms of violence indigo travels took in different
continents and time periods. In her truly remarkable doctoral project
titled, In the Clearing: Black Female Bodies, Space and Settler Colonial
Landscapes, Tiffany Lethabo-King (2013) argues for development of what
she calls, "simultaneous vision" (p. 32) in order to "see" how slavery
and settler colonialism structure one another. Indebted to her work, in
this chapter, I argue for bringing in the journey of indigo in South
Asia too to help us better \"see\" how colonialism in one place was
entangled with so many other stories of violence and people(s), and to
"see" how the indigo which stained the hands of the women in Daughters
of the Dust also structured the lives and death of colonized people in
India. This has been important for me as I continue to think about the
question of interconnectedness of white settler colonialism, slavery,
and other imperial and colonial enterprises of British and American
empires. In the next section, I give a brief summary of the
transnational travels of indigo. I will then discuss the play, paying
attention to the question of radicality of the play and discussing my
reasons for choosing it in more detail. I will analyze the play by
holding onto the social formations of caste, coloniality, and whiteness
in order to understand how anticolonial resistance of peasants was
co-opted by elite native perceptions of the 1860 Blue Mutiny. I then
look into the debates on "slavery" in East India and West India with a
focus on the question of freedom. It was in these debates that the
colonizers/Master/planters/EIC officials 219 brought the ryots from
"East India" into conversation with slaves on plantations of "West
India". Alluding to these debates, I insist on holding together both
these figures conventionally held apart by disciplinarily-separated
archives. I will end this chapter by analyzing Dash\'s film to reflect
on what I have learned about resistance from it.

#### The liquid legacies of blue colonialism and its entanglements with racial enslavement permeate the "post" colonial world. The Anthropocene thus must be understood as the Plantationocene.

to spill over into the present, not just figuratively---in the sense
that racial capitalism saturates contemporary ecologies and
economies---but materially, too.]{.underline} [Slavery altered the
natural hydrology of the American South (Silkenat 81). Industrialized

I reflect on how the ending of the novel, ultimately, resonates with
histories of "marronage and other forms of fugitive mobilities," which
as Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen and Alex Moulton write, "highlight the social
and spatial dynamics of resistance and refashioning that African,
African-descended, and Indigenous people enacted wherever chattel
slavery existed" (1260). Through the neoslave narrative, Ward salvages
the miscellaneous water-related histories and knowledges that are
bypassed by the limited purview of the Anthropocene (tailored
exclusively to the Western "Anthropos") as well as terrestrial
definitions of the Plantationocene. If, as Lucy Bond argues, [the
Anthropocene induces a "crisis of memory" through the perpetuation of
"narratives that serve to mask the historical connection between
socio-economic and ecological violence]{.underline}" (196-197), then Let
Us Descend complicates that strategic forgetfulness by articulating how
[**the so-called natural environment is physically and metaphorically
soaked in** histories of transatlantic slavery and its liquid
legacies]{.underline}. The liquid Plantationocene is a nod to two
critical interventions in which the concept of liquid(ity) has proven to
be a generative framework for understanding the fluid dynamics of racial
capitalism. The first is Hartnell's work on the experience of "[**liquid
precarity**" in what is now a sinking New Orleans (933). Whereas Zygmunt
Baumon employs the notion of "liquid modernity" to describe the
unfettered flows of global capitalism, Hartnell identifies the
phenomenon of"liquid precarity" that continues to emerge as a result of
the earth's inability to withstand the weight of racial capitalism
(933). As Hartnell reminds, this liquid precarity is evidenced by the
sea's ongoing absorption of the soil in Louisiana. Second, Rinaldo
Walcott's "The Black Aquatic" centers both the metaphorical and material
proponents of liquid. Walcott argues that "Blackness begins in the
context of liquidity---the coffle and the slave ship are its
founding.]{.underline} From historical examples like the ships Amistad
and Zong, we see how [liquidity marks the birth of black possibility
and/or potentialities that come into being. Liquidity, too, has its
opposite: liquidation"]{.underline} (66). In doing so, Walcott draws the
reader's attention to "[the liquidity of people and economies in which
the historical implications of the ship meet the contemporary
liveability of Black]{.underline} peoples' [lives]{.underline}" (66).
Thus, while the concept of [the Blue Plantationocene]{.underline} might
have situated this essay firmly within the field of **[blue
humanities]{.underline}** scholarship, I want to maintain the focus on
liquid that emerges in the work of both Hartnell and Walcott. [Blue
humanities]{.underline} discourse [is usually focused on the
possibilities that emerge when marine science and cultural studies are

Man-made [mass death]{.underline}, in other words, [is a product or side
effect of what Grove has called the Eurocene.]{.underline}38 So it is
that the war with death continues, without the promise of providing an
exit from the double death of these proliferating death worlds. In these
planetary conditions, surrounded by man-made mass death and the death
worlds it has produced, the war with death that seeks its own
evisceration seems destined to merely perform more militancy. Militant
forms of life are at war with more than death---they are at war with
lifedeath. While I don't know what will bring an end to this war with
death---this war with lifedeath---I do think it is necessary to stage a
critique of Christian repressions of death, flights from death, or
biomythical theories (political theologies) that charge death itself
with evil and enmity.

THE WINGLESS FLIGHT FROM DEATH

For a glimpse at the structures of repression, it is only natural to
turn to psychoanalysis. Norman O. Brown argued that psychoanalysis was,
itself, a biomythical theory. Brown admits that psychoanalysis
(especially Freud's theory of the instincts) bears what he calls a kind
of "mythic" dimension,39 but he also argues that the Freudian instincts
are informed by biology. Fundamentally, the psychoanalytic instincts are
oriented around Freud's observations on the biological processes of
living and dying, of life and death.40 The instincts are, in this sense,
a kind of biomythical theory.

Brown argues that Freud's claim in Beyond the Pleasure Principle---that
all living entities seek to return to the inorganic state---is simply a
claim that "death is an intrinsic part of life." It is an argument that
death is not an "external accident."41 In this sense, then, there is no
materially fixed or irreducible conflict between life and death. Rather,
the conflict arises as a dimension of culture. It is at the level of
human culture and through the construction of history, Brown argued,
that life and death are poised as "conflicting opposites." It is through
cultural discourses that the relation between life and death takes on a
more mythical cast, infusing life and death with broadly sweeping
biomythical narratives. So it is in this way, through grand biomythical
narratives, that death assumes an accidental or unnatural character or
is presented as less inevitable (at least for some). And yet, Brown
argues, what these stories also do is facilitate a repression. In their
flight from death, certain biomythical narratives function to repress
the fact of death.

Repression, argued Brown, is most fundamentally a repression of the
body. So it is that, when the fact of death is repressed, it is also a
repression of the body. It plays out within the body and has
consequences for embodied realities. It is a repression that, impacts
the life of the body. To repress the fact of death also involves, then,
a repression of life. "If death is a part of life," Brown argues, "if
there is a death instinct as well as a life (or sexual) instinct," then
a repression of one dimension of this instinct is met by a repression of
embodied complexes of instinct. The human in Brown's view is in flight
from sexuality, eros, or pleasure at the same time as he flees death.42
It is not the case, in other words, that in fleeing death (or Thanatos)
one runs into the arms of life and pleasure (Eros). Instead, the flight
from death (which creates an irresolvable biomythical conflict between
life and death) is a flight from the complex interactions between Eros
and Thanatos in lifedeath. The flight from death is a repression of the
fact of death, so a repression of lifedeath, which is also a repression
of the body (and its life).

The function of repression, Brown argues, is not simply to deny or
negate. And while it may be the case that repressions, such as the
repression of death, are simply repeated (neurotically) over and over
again, culture also makes productive use of these repressions and their
resulting neuroses. In this sense, repression serves as a transformation
or a production. Repression, he argues, "turns the timeless instinctual
compulsion to repeat into the forward-moving dialectic of neurosis which
is history."43 Repression produces the biomythical narrative that we
call history. Brown sees, in the distinction (endlessly revisited in
Western thought) between what is considered human and what is considered
animal, a permanent state of flight--- a flight from death, as well as a
flight from sexuality. And this flight from instinct (from death, from
sexuality) becomes the foundation of history. "Man aggressively builds
immortal cultures and makes history in order to fight death," as Brown
puts it.44 The erection of culture out of this flight from death is what
he calls an "extroversion" of the death instinct. This "extroverted"
form of death---the death instinct pushed outward, directed
outwardly---functions as aggression. In the flight from death, as death
becomes the greatest enemy, aggression is a roused and accordant forms
of desire are born. This extroversion of the death instinct is "the
drive to master nature" and also "the drive to master man." In essence,
it is the fact of death, repressed and "transformed into the desire to
kill, destroy, or dominate."45

In keeping with numerous intellectual predecessors, Brown believed that
psychoanalysis, like other intellectual byproducts of American and
European culture, was articulating universal truths about human nature.
For him, the flight from death was a universal symptom of civilization
as such. He understood his own diagnosis of culture to be shared by
much, if not all, of humankind. But formulations of the relationship
between life and death are resistant to this kind of simplification or
reductionism. The irreducible enmity between life and death is not a
pure cultural universal, nor are there any enduring patterns in
lifedeath that repeat themselves identically in all contexts. Instead, I
read Brown's diagnosis as a critique of the cultural context in which he
lived and thought---a cultural context that I, at a slightly different
point in its history (writing six decades after he first published these
thoughts), now share. I think he provides a critical take on especially
American reenactments of Western legacies of thought.

Over the course of many centuries, philosophical dispositions inherited
from Europe, and informed by Western Christianity, have generated
particular conceptual formulas for the naming or recognition of a human.
A distinct form of the human---a distinct form of life, a martial form
of life---has taken shape over and against the amorphous, shifting,
fluid, and highly abstract figure of the animal. While the human was
understood to be connected to the animal, often in problematic or
degenerative ways, the formation of the human as such was understood to
be that key or crucial moment of departure---his46 flight from
animality. The beginning of the human was that moment when the creature
who is human makes the critical cut or distinction that severs him from
the animal. Rather than a creation ex nihilio this is something more
like a creation ex animalis.

There has never been universal agreement on where, exactly, this cut is
or should be made. Is it the development of language? Is it a certain
dimension of cognition? Is it a form of conscious awareness? Brown
himself notes that the distinction is often drawn near death. That is to
say, there is a conceptual tendency to distinguish between what is human
and what is animal by making the argument that the human differs from
the animal because it is conscious, or aware, of the fact of death. The
beginning of the human is the awareness of animal mortality---the
realization that the animal dies. This recognition becomes the dream
that, perhaps, the human does not have to. Brown, arguing for the
insufficiency of this formula, charges that the human differs from the
animal in its (wingless) flight from death. In other words, what is
significant is not the awareness of animal mortality but the belief that
this mortality might be escapable. That, in becoming human, one might
shake off that mortality like an old coat and fly away. Because of this
flight, Brown argues, the human is distinguished through a particular
form of sickness or neurosis---the human is the animal who represses the
fact of death, its own body, its nature. To be human is to be sick in a
particular kind of way.

Brown, I think, was making a diagnosis of this conceptual figuration of
the human when its symptoms would have been considered a bit more
subclinical than they are today. He was intuiting what has become
increasingly clear to inheritors of the legacy this human left behind.
Brown's argument is not that the human is a grand achievement but that
to be human is to suffer from a particular form of illness. He
recognized that this particular form of life was aggressive, alienated,
problematic. He also understood this human to be universal---present in
any dimension of culture that would call itself "civilized." He did not
recognize it as a particular form of life: a martial form of life. But
it is often difficult to understand how much our own vision is crafted
by the water we drink. Brown was describing the human as he knew it---as
he had come to live and understand it. Today it has become clear
that [this]{.underline} **[allegedly universal formation of
the]{.underline}** [human (inherited from European thought, performed,
dissected, and examined in the academic and cultured recesses of the
United States of America) was designed, specifically, to exclude
forms of the human that did not fit within its contours. It was, in its
incipient dimensions, normatively male. More than that, it was white (or
perhaps more to the point, anti-Black). And the figure of the animal on
which this particular form of the human so critically depends enacts and
facilitates a reductionist erasure of animate lives; it is a subjective
erasure or systemic collapse of biodiverse forms and figurations. It is,
we might say, a martial form of life that has flowered in the
Eurocene.]{.underline}

The **[formation of the human]{.underline}** that Brown was diagnosing
and critiquing---in his time---[was]{.underline} [**beginning to show
its cracks**.]{.underline} It had become subject to too much wear and
tear. [**Today**,]{.underline} [**it is more clearly imploding**. This
imploding figure is approached, reflected on, and picked apart from any
number of critical angles today]{.underline}: the posthumanities, animal
studies and the environmental humanities, **[Black
studies]{.underline}**, African diaspora studies, **[decolonial
thought]{.underline}**, feminist theory, and queer theory [(to name but
a few)]{.underline}. Here, I am interested in this figuration of the
human primarily for how it models a particular relational configuration
between life and death. To follow Brown and others, this figuration of
the human takes shape against the generic, abstract, figure of the
animal. If the animal comes to represent, for this human, the world of
nature, then part of what the animal succumbs to is the pattern of death
that works within and upon nature. To take flight away from animality,
for this form of the human, is also a flight away from death. It is to
live---to try to live---above death. Death becomes the enemy to flee
because death knows that this human has no wings and cannot fly far.
Death threatens, always, to pull the human back into the confines of his
own two-legged animality. [One of the]{.underline} **[implications of
the implosion]{.underline}** [of this figuration of **the human (and
the lifeworlds it has created, to nurture and sustain its progeny) is
that it is now being faced with the death it was designed to
repress---the possibility of its own extinction.**]{.underline}

In the end, [Brown believed that it was possible to redeem this form of
the human]{.underline}, and the purpose of his diagnosis was to
understand the cure. [He believed that there was a]{.underline} **[kind
of redemption]{.underline}** in the return to animality, which was, of
course, also a return to nature---what Spinoza called God-or-nature.
What Brown called the "abolition of repression" 47 would also mark a
return to what he called the "polymorphous perversity" of childhood---an
experience of the erotic potentialities of the body that refuse to be
restricted to the genital organs. 48 He argued that this polymorphous
perversity was, in essence, identical to what Spinoza called the
intellectual love of God, 49 which is also the love of Nature. It was
with all of this in mind that Brown made the argument that
psychoanalysis is fundamentally a part of what Alfred North Whitehead
called the Romantic Reaction. 50 It harbored a redemptive potency in the
return to nature and animality. I am not interested, in this particular
project, in either cultivating or stifling romance.
Ultimately, [I]{.underline} **[do not entirely
trust]{.underline}** [myself to traffic in redemption
narratives.]{.underline} Perhaps I am too skeptical of them and yet also
too curious about the possibilities they might harbor. But what I have
observed, from my own critical context, is that the [figure of
the]{.underline} [human I have been speaking
of]{.underline} [is i**mploding in ways**]{.underline} [that may
ultimately]{.underline} **[render it]{.underline}** **[beyond
redemption.]{.underline}**

I am not speaking here of the extinction of human life on earth,
although I realize that this is one of the possibilities that circulates
in the many discourses on extinction that cloud us, today. [We live in a
time of extinctions. Mass extinction events in the more than human
world underscore the multiple nature of the figure of extinction, and
extinction events in their full plurality cloud and haunt our
conversations about living and dying. The fact of extinction has
become as inescapable as the fact of]{.underline} [**death**, and it
renders the fact of]{.underline} **[death a
collective]{.underline}** [(rather than simply an individual)
reality.]{.underline} In this conceptual climate [there is not just one
form of extinction that seems to threaten but many.]{.underline} I am
speaking here about a specific, contingent, and particular formation or
figuration of the human that has presented itself as universal. It is
becoming increasingly clear just how contingent this martial form of
life is. [It is becoming increasingly clear just]{.underline} [**how
racialized this form of life is**, and just how much the line between
this form of the human (on the one hand) and the animal (on the other)
serves as another]{.underline} **[racialized
distinction]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**secure Western
superiority**, to]{.underline} [**rearticulate
whiteness**.]{.underline} And it is becoming increasingly clear just how
much [the]{.underline} [weapons, tools, and technologies developed
by those who lived fully into this form of the human
harbor the potential to decimate planetary life as such. It is becoming
increasingly clear that the hunger for capital appropriation that pulses
in the belly of this form of the human is driving species extinctions in
more than human lifeworlds. And it is becoming increasingly clear
just how intimately our own fate (as humans) is bound to and dependent
upon the fates of these earth others. This particular form of the human
is hovering in a kind of indeterminate zone, and it is not yet clear
whether it will burn to the ground only to rise up from its ashes into
a richer militancy or whether it will---instead---find itself in
bed with its own mortality. ]{.underline}Will this form of the human,
this particular human story, continue to repress the fact of death more
militantly than ever before? Or will it allow us to sit with it, as it
takes its final breaths--- to do a kind of palliative care?

#### The [alternative is to think with blue]{.underline}---our conceptualization of praxis critically [reframes]{.underline} the [colonial history of blueness]{.underline}, decentering the desire for extractive wealth by disrupting the colonizers attachment to [phenomenal identity]{.underline}.

**\*\*bracketed for gendered language\*\***

"Going green" or "living green" often stands for adopting a zero-waste
and sustain- able lifestyle, connecting color to aesthetics and, more
often than not, to a more digest- ible type of capitalist consumerism.
Green has long been synonymous with nature and ecology and a preferred
descriptor for sustainability. In Prismatic Ecologies, Jeffrey Jerome
Cohen writes that "green dominates our thinking about ecology like no
other, as if the color were the only organic hue, a blazon for nature
itself."6 Developing a more expansive "prismatic ecology," Cohen
decentralizes green from its environmental throne: "Such a colorful
ascription begs the question of exactly what mode of being we are
attempting to sustain, and at what environmental cost."7 Like green,
blue has been increasingly pres- ent in institutional and
intergovernmental discourse as an adjective to draw attention to
potential economic development of bodies of water.8 These color changes
incite me to question what happens when green becomes blue: [What
exactly is and can blue be? How can we think beyond a simplistic
equation of blue with water, oceans, and seas, to investigate what
thinking with blue means in the blue humanities?9 Inspired by Donna
Haraway, it matters what colors color colors; how blues blue blues.10
Reckoning with the coloniality of blue informs its potential for present
and future blue endeavors. Untangling colonial blues as well as the
anticolonial resistance this color encourages, blue shows it- self as a
color that always already resists simplistic signiﬁcation.]{.underline}
The polyvocal theoretical currents that are thought-with in the blue
humanities build on the expansive nature of environmental cultural
thought and the genealogies of aquatic scholarship. Drawing on Donna
Haraway's "situated knowledges" and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa's
"thinking-with that resists the individualization of thinking," the blue
humanities can be thought of as enacting a "thinking-with-many," moving
from ﬁelds of thought to seas of circulation.11 The many that inform the
blue humanities, and particularly the analysis of aquatic colonial
undercurrents, include insights from Epeli Hau'ofa, Paul Gilroy, Kamau
Brathwaite, Elizabeth DeLoughrey, Édouard Glissant, Marcus Rediker,
Alice te Punga Somerville, Kerry Bystrom, Isabel Hofmeyr, Stefan
Helmreich, Hester Blum, Steve Mentz, Margaret Cohen, Peter Steinberg,
Kimberley Peters, Cecilia Åsberg, Laura Ingersoll, Stacy Alaimo, Ann
Elias, Christina Sharpe, Craig Santos Perez, Laura Winkiel, Astrida
Neimanis, and Melody Jue, with-many-more.12 Their work and the various
edited collections and special issues that have evoked the "blue
humanities," "critical ocean studies," "hydro-criticism," and "liquid
ecologies," address the numerous beginnings of the aquatic humanities
before and beyond the articulation of the blue humanities.13 Neimanis's
assertion that "we are all bodies of water" and Te Punga Somerville's
foregrounding of the long genealogy of Indigenous oceanic kinship add an
expansive materiality to Stacy Alaimo's consideration of human- ity's
"aquatic ancestors" and our trans-corporeal "kinship with the seas."14
These discussions prove the need for the blue humanities to [address the
continuation of the watery beyond continental boundaries via a
"transoceanic imaginary"]{.underline} and a "hydroco- lonial" approach
to salty, brackish, and fresh water.15 Expanding the environmental
humanities to the realm of the blue then invokes the question: What
exactly does thinking with blue add to these already existent aquatic
and oceanic discourses? And what does it mean to do the blue humanities
and [consider the blue not just as symbol but as material-semiotic
actant or figuration?16 In this essay I develop an analysis of the color
blue through its colonial materiality to argue that in the blue
humanities blue unmoors and loosens the anchor of Western colonial
desire.]{.underline}17 Like the oceanic "violet-black" depths Alaimo
calls upon to "understand the water of the abyssal zone as something
rather than nothing," [the blue puts the colonial to sea and surfaces
its material significance.]{.underline}18 I analyze the work of Dutch
visual artist Pieter Paul Pothoven and the poetic performance of
Aotearoa New Zealand poet Selina Tusi- tala Marsh to show how the blue
always already asserts itself and acts to resurface [and subvert
transoceanic colonial connections. This essay aims to unpack the
coloniality of blues---including indigo, ultramarine, and royal
blue---in conversation with the work of two contemporary artists to show
how the color blue acts in]{.underline} the world---materially,
socially, economically, and culturally---via the dynamic work it does in
the blue humani- ties, "[in the wake" of colonial desire]{.underline}.19
Blue Colonialisms and Ultramarine beyond the Sea Navy blue is not the
only shade of blue with a captivating material history and colo- nial
reverberations. The histories of several blues can be traced back to
early capitalist trade and imperial expansions across the seas. For a
long time, the most beautiful blue in the world was widely considered to
be ultramarine, also named true blue or, accord- ing to the fourteenth
century Italian painter Cennino Cennini, "the most perfect of all
colours."20 The ultramarine pigment is mostly composed of the blue
mineral lazurite, which is the main component of the lapis lazuli
mineral stone (a "stone from the sky": lapis is Latin for "stone,"
lazuli came to Latin via the Arabic ﻻﺯﻭﺭﺩ , which came via the Persian
ﻻﺟﻮﺭﺩ , meaning "sky" or "heaven"). It owes its deep blue shade to a
mixture of minerals---lazurite, silicates, and iron pyrite---and covers
a wide range of shades "from a deep, almost violet blue, through the
royal blue of the gem quality to light blue, a tur- quoise and finally
fewer pieces of brilliant green."21 This means that natural ultrama-
rine is never an entirely uniform shade of blue. The most high-quality
shades contain a high percentage of lazurite, giving it a bright, rich,
and warm blue tone. To extract natural ultramarine from ground lapis
lazuli is incredibly labor inten- sive. The process involves grinding
stones to a fine powder and mixing it with wax, resin, and linseed oil:
This mass, usually wrapped in a cloth, was left to sit for several
weeks, after which it was kneaded in rain water or a diluted solution of
lye. The blue particles dispersed into the liquid, while the impurities
remained in the mass. This process was usually repeated several times,
with each successive extraction generating a lower quality pigment. The
final extraction---consisting largely of colourless material, and a few
small blue particles---was known as ultramarine ash.22 The high cost of
the imported raw material, combined with the laborious process to
produce a high-quality pigment, meant that for a long time ultramarine
was at least as expensive as gold. The deep blue of ultramarine has
therefore long been a symbol of extravagance and luxury. The trade of
lapis lazuli dates to at least the Mesopotamian Late Ubaid period, circa
3500 BCE, "probably the first moment that man had sufficient wealth and
leisure to begin the quest for luxuries."23 Our current knowledge of the
his- tory of ultramarine dates to the fifth-century murals in Nisa
(Turkmenistan) and ex- tends into the twenty-first century. In March
2001, the sixth-century Bamiyan Buddha statues were declared false idols
by the Taliban government in Afghanistan and blown up with dynamite.
Once upon a time, the two Buddhas had been covered in precious stones
and ultramarine and carmine robes. In his travel report, Dà Táng X ı- yù
Jì 大唐西域 記 (Great Tang Records on the Western Region), Chinese monk
Xuanzang 玄奘 describes his visit to Bamiyan circa 629--645, as he makes
a detour on his way to India in order to see the giant sculptures: To
the north-east of the royal city there is a mountain, on the declivity
of which is placed a stone figure of Buddha, erect, in height 140 or 150
feet. Its golden hues sparkle on every side, and its precious ornaments
dazzle the eyes by their brightness. To the east of this spot there is a
standing figure of Sâkya Buddha, made of metallic stone (teou-shih) in
height 100 feet. It has been cast in different parts and joined
together, and thus placed in a complete form as it stands.24 The
ultramarine pigment used for the robes of the smaller Buddha statue
likely came from the nearby mines in the Blue Mountain (Koh-e-Laguard).
The mines in the Sar-e- Sang valley (the "Place of the Stone") in the
Badakhsan mountains in northeastern Afghanistan were the main supply for
European and Persian ultramarine up until 1830.25 Afghan ultramarine was
most extensively desired in Europe in the fourteenth to sixteenth
centuries, when it was transported from East to West along the famous
Silk Route from Afghanistan to Syria and across the Mediterranean Sea
into Europe. This journey remains embedded in its name. Ultramarine, in
Latin, means "beyond the sea." It refers to the voyage beyond the
Mediterranean Sea that European traders had to take to obtain the
pigment, but also signifies its superlative blueness---the most blue,
more blue than the sea---so blue that every artist in the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries aspired to use it. In Bluets (2009),
her autobiographical prose-poetic ode to the color blue, Maggie Nelson
writes that ultramarine "had to be made holy, by the wicked logic that
renders the expensive sacred."26 In the Middle Ages, Afghan lapis lazuli
was so expensive that painters could only use it sparingly, dependent on
the wealth of their patrons. To not waste its extravagance on unworthy
subjects, only the most highly regarded, most holy subjects in Western
Christian art were afforded the deep blue pigment. Ultramarine's
otherworldly cost and provenance could only be justified by restricting
its use to honor the otherworldly divinity of the Virgin Mary. The blue
robes that Mary wears in Giotto's Lamentation (Scrovegni Chapel, 1306),
for instance, are painted in ultramarine blue, a tra- dition that would
continue for centuries and would solidify the narrative connection
between blue and otherworldly riches. The ultramarine blue of Giotto's
work and in particular his depiction of the life of Christ and Mary in
the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, Italy, has challenged theorists and asks
us to consider: What effect does the perceived extravagance of the color
blue have on its signification and identification? n "Giotto's Joy"
(1980), French feminist philosopher Julia Kristeva writes that the
overwhelming colors used in Giotto's frescoes, and in particular the
overwhelming blues, translate "instinctual drives into colored
surface."27 Kristeva's feminist psychoanalytical analysis draws on color
perception theory and infant vision development to argue that [blue has
a quality beyond identity: "The perception of blue entails not
identifying the ob- ject; that blue is, precisely, on this side of or
beyond the object's fixed form; that it is the zone where phenomenal
identity vanishes." On the basis of André Broca's paradox that "to see a
blue light, you must not look directly at it" and the idea that infants
do not de- velop "centered vision---the identification of objects,
including one's own image," or an 'ideal-I,' until after the development
of color perception, Kristeva argues that blue always escapes
identification. Blue, with its short wavelengths, is even "earlier to
appear" in the vision of the infant child than any other color.28
Feminist visual art theorist Barbara Bolt explains Kristeva's
description of seeing Giotto's blue as the "experience of the (Lacanian)
Real erupting into and disrupting signification. . . . Colour is
destabilizing."29 Kristeva writes, "All colors, but blue in particular,
would have a noncentered or decentering effect, lessening both object
identification and phenomenal fixation. They thereby return the subject
to the archaic moment of its dialectic, that is, before the fixed,
specular 'I,' but while in the process of becoming this 'I' by breaking
away from instinctual, biological (and also maternal) dependence."30
Kristeva's analysis of Giotto's disruptive blue enforces a
material-semiotic response that goes beyond symbolic representation.
Giotto's blue is more than a symbol of otherworldly wealth, more than
paint on the ceiling; it entangles viewer and pigment, and uncenters
human-subjectivity to the more-than-human materiality of the blue and
its origins beyond the seas. When ultramarine and indigo meet, they
destabilize the idea that expansive wealth and obtaining new minerals
and materials across the seas is a universal sign of linear progress.
Kristeva's viewer "enters into the semidarkness of the Arena Chapel . .
. struck by the light that is generated, catching the eye because of the
colour blue."31 He walks into the Scrovegni Chapel as a Western subject,
a humanist I, overwhelmed with his visions of control over the natural
wealth of the world, and loses \[themselves\]~~himself~~ just by looking
at the bright color pigment on the walls. If, following Bolt and
Kristeva, the color blue indeed disrupts, decenters, and destabilizes,
what does this mean for the way it is em- ployed in the blue humanities?
The unruly presence of Giotto's brilliant blues reinforces the West's
economic and political force and legacies of extractive violence but
simulta- neously exposes its limits. The materiality of blue, as
otherworldly-pigment-beyond-the- sea, foregrounds the coloniality of its
past, but like in Sharpe's "wake work," "the past that is not the past
reappears, always, to rupture the present."32 Narrating the colonial
histories of Giotto's blue and ultramarine shows that blue unmoors
simplistic significa- tion and acts to disrupt a colonial logic of
extraction.]{.underline}

[Making the seabed of the Arctic Ocean legible was critical to US
maritime strategy throughout the Cold War.]{.underline} Military
planners, as with their Soviet counterparts, wanted to know more about
this particular theatre for two fundamental reasons. First, [the US Navy
wanted to be able to track and monitor the movements of their Soviet
counterparts, especially if ice cover made aerial surveillance
problematic.]{.underline} [Second,]{.underline} armed with [superior
oceanographic and bathymetric knowledge of the Arctic, it was hoped that
the US would have a decisive military advantage in the event of war
breaking out between the two superpowers and their allies.]{.underline}
The collection of such information was aided and abetted by a series of
drifting ice stations, which used echo-sounding techniques to collect
under ice acoustic data. Soviet and US drifting ice stations, operating
during the International Geophysical Year of 1957--1958, contributed
further to this task even if data collected was not shared in the same
manner as was experienced in the Antarctic.

Both [states were determined to make the Arctic Ocean legible for
geopolitical reasons]{.underline}. A major turning point was the voyage
of the nuclear powered US submarine *Nautilus* in 1958 and its
sub-surface voyage to the North Pole followed in March 1959 by the
surfacing of the *Skate* at the same geographical point. These voyages
gave fresh impetus to the Office of Naval Research and both voyages
demonstrated that nuclear submarines could operate in all seasons, and
with greater understanding of the Arctic Ocean Basin, it became
increasingly feasible to detect and avoid icebergs and judge when and
how to break surface ice. This expanding corpus of [geographical
knowledge about the Arctic and North Atlantic coincided with civilian
mapping projects,]{.underline} funded by the Defense Research
Development Board, designed to enhance understanding of the seabed floor
and temperature profile of the oceans. As Hamblin (2005) has noted,
"[Reliable data would allow the US Navy to colonize this environment
i.e. control or master it in order to best navigate it in the next
war".]{.underline}

[While the Cold War had subsided, this desire to make Arctic territory
legible has taken a different kind of turn in the last decade informed
as much by changing sea ice patterns, seaborne mobility, and resource
speculation as they are by military-strategic rationales
(]{.underline}[Lopez, 1988, ]{.underline}[Bravo and Rees, 2006). What
emerges is a sense of the Arctic as a palimpsest -- quite literally
'again scraped'.]{.underline} As colonial, Cold War and now War on
Terror era rationales and representations intermingle with one another.
Adriana Craciun is right in part to remind us that, "They have come by
airship, plane, balloon, nuclear submarine, and most recently by Russian
mini-sub... Scientists predict an ice-free Arctic Ocean in a few
decades, at which point one might think that the 'Northwest Passage'
will cease to mean anything". Where I disagree is the notion that
meaning somehow disappears rather than enriching multiple legibilities
of the Arctic.

Geographers such as Matthew Hannah, 2000, Hannah, 2009 have turned to
[Michel Foucault\'s suggestive writings on governmentality and
calculable territory to re-configure what made the modern governance of
populations possible.]{.underline} Drawing on Scott\'s arguments
pertaining to legibility, Hannah (2009: 68) shows clearly how there are
a series of important moments including inscribing territory with "basic
systems of geographical reference that allow knowledge about
populations, resources and activities to be indexed to specific
locations, and hence make territory readable". The 2007 Russian
expedition to the bottom of the central Arctic Ocean was preoccupied
with the collection of bathymetric and oceanographic data (see Fig. 3).
The [mapping and]{.underline} subsequent public [display of]{.underline}
that [knowledge]{.underline} of the Arctic seabed [is an essential
element of]{.underline} what we will subsequently be considering --
[extending sovereign rights over outer continental shelf
regions.]{.underline}

In so doing, this analysis addresses a series of themes. First, the
actual process of making Arctic territories is considered with specific
reference to the Law of the Sea, a body of international law associated
with the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS) occupies
center-stage (Steinberg, 2001, Vogler, 2000). It is, under UNCLOS, that
a large number of states (excluding the United States) agreed to divide
the seas and oceans into discreet territorial zones including exclusive
economic zones and outer continental shelf. Second, the establishment
and recognition of those boundaries and zones are not inconsequential.
The role of the UN-based body, the CLCS, is pertinent because it acts as
a center of territorial calculation and through its 'recommendations'
plays a critical role in legitimising effective rule at a considerable
distance from political centres such as Copenhagen, Moscow, Oslo, Ottawa
and Washington, DC. Finally, these 'recommendations' help to conjure up
and constitute the Arctic as an object of governance.

[The inscription of Arctic territory including remote areas of the
seabed by coastal states and international bodies]{.underline} such as
the CLCS [makes it both more legible and accessible]{.underline} --
although in this case accessibility is unusual in the sense that it is
likely to only apply to scientists and their logistical sponsors
including civilian and military agencies such as the US Coast Guard.
Access to these territories will, because of their remoteness,
inevitably be conditioned by variable sea ice/weather. The CLCS
requested that the Russian authorities conduct further oceanographic
research in the central Arctic Ocean following their 2001 submission to
this UN body. What has changed in the intervening period, however, was
this attempt to calculate subterranean territory was further heightened
by a growing awareness of an Arctic being changed by ice melting and
debates over accessibility involving a range of parties including
coastal and non-coastal states.

[The establishment of calculable territory depends on underwater
interventions]{.underline} and the travails of mini-submarines and
survey vessels are helping [to create the conditions for further
sovereign interventions.]{.underline} The map and the survey are one
element of this intervention but so are other kinds of activities and
practices. In a speech to an audience in the Canadian Arctic, the
Canadian Prime Minister noted that:

But you can\'t defend Arctic sovereignty with words alone...It takes a
Canadian presence on the ground, in the air and on the sea and a
Government that is internationally recognized for delivering on its
commitments. And I am here today to make it absolutely clear there is no
question about Canada\'s Arctic border...All along the border, our
jurisdiction extends outward 200 miles into the surrounding sea, just as
it does along our Atlantic and Pacific coastlines...Some in the
opposition dismiss our focus on northern sovereignty as expensive and
unnecessary...Some have actually come to the North and suggested our
plans here are a waste of money. To that I say, government\'s first
obligation is to defend the territorial integrity of its borders...This
is Nunavut -- "Our Land" -- just as Yukon and the Northwest Territories
and the entire Arctic Archipelago are "Our Land" (Harper, 2006).

Notwithstanding the Prime Minister\'s extraordinary appropriation of the
Inuit term 'Nunavut', it does give an indication of the apparent stakes.
[Making territory legible, especially in the absence of the protective
covering of ice, raises the spectre of intrusion and transgression even
in areas where citizens will never see let alone walk over.]{.underline}
And as one commentator has recently noted, [the legibility of the Arctic
carries with not just contemporary anxieties but longer colonial
trajectories, "...the Northwest Passage has long been regarded not as a
distinct place, but as a threshold to a desired place elsewhere, be it
the commercial riches of China, natural resources in the High
Arctic,]{.underline} or the paradise imagined to exist at the ice-free
North Pole..." (Craciun, 2009: 14).

The spectre of an ice-free North Pole is unquestionably one of the most
powerful incentives to make those subterranean territories legible. It
also helps to explain and legitimate a special kind of icy geopolitics
(Dodds, 2008). Mobilising terms such as 'borders', 'our land' and
'presence', Prime Minister Harper helped to conjure up the exceptional
-- the Arctic as an exceptional space, which demands extraordinary
measures to make sure that Canadians care as much as the Arctic as they
might about the Bay of Fundy. In Canada\'s case, new investment in
icebreakers, military bases, scientific mapping and enhanced homeland
security measures were initiated (Heubert, 2009, Byers, 2009). As we
shall see, however, those attempts to intervene and to enhance
legibility are rarely straightforward in a remote environment strongly
shaped by ocean currents, sea ice formation and extreme weather. The
Arctic, notwithstanding the desires and demands of coastal states and
their political representatives, is a lively space.

### 1NC -- Law

#### Arctic exploration necessitates mapping which translates that which is fluid and indeterminate into static wholes. This is indicative of the desire to control blue through cartographic representations of land and sea. These representations enable colonial fantasies of sovereignty which perpetrate violence at sea and on land. This violence naturalizes the sea as a repository of resources and profit -- an orientation which is indicative of and reifies western blue desires.

[The surface of the sea has long been viewed as a blank
space.]{.underline} As Carl Schmitt famously quipped in 1950, \"On the
waves, there is nothing but waves\" (1003, 4?). In the popular
imaginary, the oceans continue to be seen as a place outside
conventional politics. Futurists and libertarian rapid technological and
ecological changes that have taken place over the past few decades are
prompting serious i • Johnson and Braverman 218-81190 ch01 IP.indd 2
6/26/19 4:56 PM reconsiderations of how the seas are governed,
suggesring an urgent need for more critical attention to the laws of the
sea, in their broadest and most pluralistic iterarions. Blue Legalities
offers such an intensified analysis. Specifically, the inrerdisciplinary
contributors of this volume contemplate different ways in which our
political frameworks and legal infrastructures have been made,
concested, and remade in the oceans. This goes to highlight one ofthe
primary motivations for this volume: unblackboxing law.Just as science
renders its procedures and technical work invisible and neutral, so,
too, do legal rules and procedures---suchas those related to
sovereignty, authority, territory, and jurisdiction---makeinvisible
certain ideological assumptions and obscure the labor undertaken for
their construction. And just as the understanding of science should not
be the domain of scientists alone and should involve a critical stance
toward these practices, the scudy of law, too, should noc oniy be
confined to lawyers and legal scholars. Accordingly, the contributors to
this volume consider law from different academic backgrounds, including
geography, anthropology, law, political science, history, gender
studies, English, and environmental studies. We collectively draw upon
these transdisciplinary trajectories to think critically about ocean
law, thus contesring the hegemony oflegal experts in this regard. There
is already a steady body of [scholarship about ocean law]{.underline}.
However, this scholarship [has mostly been confined to a positivistic
analysis of state laws and international treatises that pertain to the
sea.]{.underline} Indeed, much has been written about law with a capital
L---namely, the formal statutes, regulations, case law, and
international treaties that govern the seas and their inhabitants (see,
e.g., Bishara 2.017; Craig zoii; Harrison 1011; Nyman 1013; Ranganathan
2.016; Scheiber and Paik 1013; Stephens and VanderZwaag 1014; Tanaka
2.008[). In most of it, the oceans and their inhabitants appear to be
passive to the legal infrastructures imposed upon them.]{.underline}
While vve recognize that formal laws and administrarive bodies are
important and prevalent and should not be ignored as such, we are not
concerned only with law\'s official and binding articulations[. Instead,
we]{.underline} follow in the wake of other legal scholars who have been
pursuing quesdons around the constitution of legalities in terrestrial
contexts to argue that the law permeates our understandings ofspace and
matter. We then apply this argument beyond the terrestrial environments
to engage with the vexing problems associated with the ocean\'s watery
worlds. [By turning toward the relationship between governance and the
life of ecological networks,]{.underline} this volume joins a growing
licerature on more-than.-human legalities. Drawing in particular on Anna
Grear\'s worlc on law and the Anthropocene (zois),Andreas
Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos\'swriringon nonhuman materialities (ioi6a,
2.oi6b), Irus Braverman\'s explorations of nonhuman legalities (1015;
2.016; 2.oi8b), and Alain Pottage\'s explorations ofmateriality in the
biosciences (2.012.; Pottage and Marris 2.012.), this volume [focuses
attention on]{.underline} the microscale questions concerning [ocean law
and its biopolitical enframings.]{.underline} Rather than start with an
assumption oflaw as a prediscursive entity, we follow Pottage\'s lead to
consider the seas themselves and, interconnected to that exploration, to
also study various laws as socio-scientific, heterogeneous, and material
phenomena. Like much of the literature on the blue turn in the social
sciences and humanities, rhis body of legal scholarship, too, has been
influenced by science and technology studies and new materialisms.
Contributors to this volume apply these rich insights to consider the
ordinary and extraordinary projects ofgoverning oceans. The volume\'s
chapters are grounded in a careful empirical analysis that spans
historical time periods and geographic locations. The concributors
emphasize the extent to which soft standards, temporal imaginaries, and
scientific guidelines govern various aspects ofocean life as well as how
they prescribe and regulate the everyday pracrices ofscientists,
managers, and other actors who operate in and impact this space. Whereas
traditionally not perceived as legal actors per se, following the
practices ofthese various experts in fact reveals an entire new world
ofvaried and plural laws. At the same time, we also consider the
connections as well as the frictions that emerge where systems
ofgovernance interact with complex geophysical, ecological, economic,
and technological processes. Such a broader and more relational
understandingoflegalities makes space for critical inquiries. Some ofthe
central questions that emerge from this more relational understanding
include: How are existing systems of governance adjusting to the abrupt
and radical changes that threaten the health of the oceans ? And how
might thinking with the seas and their inhabitants engender
opportunities for the contestation and transformation of ocean
governance? This volume\'s interdisciplinary contributors present varied
responses to these questions. Neither univocal nor singular, these
responses demonstrate that blue legalities are not ofone ocean, nor
ofone law; instead, they are made up ofthe multiple and messy registers
through which we engage the seas. Such legalities ofthe seas evince what
Stephanie Lavau has referred to in the context offresh water governance
as a \"multiple reality\" that hangs together in \"untidy
entanglement\[s\]\" (zoi3, 42-8). We emphasize the vast and unusual
challenges associated with regulating this multiple and fluid reality as
it manifests in the spaces, matters, and lives ofthe sea. Alongside
their messiness and multiplicity, oceans are also dynamic and unscable.
Steinberg and Peters write rhat the seas are a \"space ofchurning\"
(1015, 4 • Johnson and Braverman 218-81190ch01 IP.indd 4 6/26/19 4-56PM
2.58). Amid \"processes of \'arranging,\' \'gathering,\' \'mucture,\'
and \'turbulence,\' the oceans exist in a near consrant state of
re-formation (2,56). This volume brings the churn ofthis reality to
light by showinghow, from the turbulence of thinking with ocean
legalities, possibilities for more plural relations between rime, place,
and law may emerge. Accordingly, thi.s introduction explores four
central themes: the vast legalities between knowledge and ignorance,
temporal governance in the Anthropocene, a sea of lines and laws, and
governing vvith more-than-human sea creatures. The Vast Legalities
between Knowledge and Ignorance Emergent from our examinations ofboth
ocean Law and its laws---namely,ofthe macro, as well as the micro,
scales oflaw---isthe enhanced reliance ofthese forms ofgovernance on
scientists and scientific discourse. The relationship betwcen knowledge,
imagination, and ignorance finds a fruitful substrate in the sea.Long
held in the deep, matter and fantasies resurface in legal and scientific
accounts ofmaritime spaces. This collection carefully unravels the
coproduction ofocean matter, scientific knowledge, and legislative
classifications and enframings. The oceans have historically been
characterized by inaccessibility and indeterminacy. For centuries, much
ofthis space was mostly unknown. Cartographers of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries made up for the absence of knovvledge by filling the
seemingly blank spaces with fantastical monsters and mermen. Today,
ignorance remains central to the seas\' legalities. In the legal
literacure, the opacity ofthe oceans is most often understood to
incapacitate managers of marine resources or conservationists who seek
to curb pollution and battle other perils (Charles 1998; De Wolff
2.017). According to many scholars, scientists, and policy makers, the
proper government of ocean resources requires the management, and even
the excision, ofignorance (see, e.g., Pauly 2.015). This, precisely. is
how the scienusts injessica Lehmans chapter, \"The Technopolitics
ofOcean Sensing,\" approach the acquisition ofmarine data. Imagining the
sea as a \"borderless space\" and as the object ofa global science that
could \"benefit ali ofhumanity,\" these scientists have released
thousands ofrobotic devices into both national and international waters.
Meant to facilitate better governance through obtaining more complete
data, autonomous underwater robots like Argo floats collect
\"real-time\" readings on temperature, salinity, and movement ofthe
planetary ocean. These attempts to eradicate ignorance are undergirded
by the assumprion that knowledge production takes place outside and
before the law. Indeed, scientific knowledge is typically considered as
preceding the law and as providing Lntroducrion • the foundation for
legal inscription. But, of course, scientific and legal practices are
deeply entangled. This volume\'s contributions show how attempts to
manage, harness, and govern oceans also shape ontological and
epistemological claims---whatSheila JasanofF refers to as the
\"co-production\" of scientific knowledge practices and law. She writes
that \"the law is now an inescapable feature ofthe conditioning
environment that produces socially embedded .. . science\" (1008, y6z).
How we come to know the oceans and their inhabitants as objects ofstudy
thus neither precedes nor merely services the law. Rather, scientists
produce knowledge through legal systems and via governmental frameworks.
At the same time, techno-physical and scientific practices also shape
regulatory and adminisirative systems. As Lehman shows, the widespread
use ofautonomous robots both contests and reshapes legal
infrastructures. Specifically, their use imposes a universal regulation
of the sea.s, thereby challenging the longstanding sovereign control
ofnation-states over their territorial waters. Alongside the efforts to
acquire ever greater repositories of knowledge that would eliminate the
unknown, blue legalities are also shaped by what Roberr Proctor and
Londa Schiebinger call \"agnotology\": the production of ignorance
(zoo8). In paying attention to the ways that scientific and legal
frameworks are imbricated, this volume\'s contributors highlight how not
only determinacies, but also indeterminacies, are coproduced and even
exacerbated to make ocean spaces more manageable. In other words, the
uwproductive and counterproductwe aspects of knowledge are made to
matter for ocean governance. In some cases, knowledge of the
complexiries of geophysical and ecological processes in the ocean is
ignored, overwritten, or willfnlly avoided to better administer the
seas. Stefan Helmreich makes just that point in his contribution to this
volume, which focuses on the controversy surrounding the attempted
building ofaseawall around an Irish golfcourse owned by US president
Donald Trump. While his permit proposal references scientific dara that
links sea-level rise to climate change, Trump himselfhas actively, and
notoriously, denied this connection. According to Helmreich, Trump\'s
simultaneous deployment and disavowal of climate science illuminates how
\"science and law are rhetorically coproduced at one moment and torn
asunder at another.\" In this instance ofsovereign claims to space and
power, \"dissimulation and misdirection\" reign. We find evidence of the
important role of ignorance in Holly Jean Buck\'s chapter as well, where
it is precisely the lack of attention to ocean acidification in climare
legislation that has enabled the rise of the scientific imaginary of a
geoengineered planet. Finally, injessica Lehman\'s account, it is
ignorance ofthe law, rather than ignorance ofthe sea, that enables the
use ofautonomous robots and facilitates scientific research. As Astrida
Neimanis argues in her chapter in 6 • Johnson and Bravcrman 218-81190
ch01 1P indd 6 6/26/19 4:56 PM rhe context ofburied toxic contaminants,
the \"full knowability\" ofthe sea will always elude us. One ofthe
challenges for blue legalities is figuring ouc how to insist on
accountability andjustice in the absence ofcomplete knowledge. Beyond
blurring the boundaries between knowledge and ignorance, the mysterious
and seemingly alien matter ofthe seas also troubles distinctions between
matter and fantasy. As Stacy Alaimo writes: \"Terrestrial humans have
often found it more convenient to imagine that the seas are imaginary
than to undertake the scienti£c,cultural, and political work necessary
to trace substantia.1 interconnections between human discourses, human
practices, and marine habitats\" (1012., 179). Understanding ocean
imaginaries is therefore an important undertaking. In her chapter, \"The
Sea Wolfand the Sovereign,\" Stephaniejones examines how such maritime
imaginaries---theirsymbols, metaphors, and fantasies--- have shaped the
history and spatial politics ofthe sea. Taking inspiration from Jacques
Derrida\'s writing on the animal, Jones looks to the figure of the sea
wolf, demonstraring how her appearance in the literature configures
sovereign power, with its paradigms oflegality and illegality. In
parucularjones connects the sea wolf\'s liminal form oflife to human
stories about piracy on the high seas. As she argues, such stories have
in fact legirimized the sovereign state\'s foundational relationship to
violence. Knowledge and fantasy blur also in contemporary attempts to
legitimize future visions ofsovereignty. Elizabeth R. Johnsons chapter,
\"The Hydra and the Leviathan,\" shows, accordingly, how the US military
channels scientific research to create a future geopolitical sea space
that is favorable to US interests. Like the researchers in Lehman\'s
chapter, in this chapter, too, military strategists and the scientist
they fund endeavor to know more about what lies beneath the sea surface.
But unlike the operators of the Argo floats who use robotic devices to
expand scientific knowledge, the military strategists here use these
devices to enhance military capacity. These efforts are justified on the
back ofa geographical imaginary (Gregory 1994) composed ofmilitarized
histories, imagined threats, and speculative fiitures. Dangers that
allegedly lurk beneath the oceans\' depths haunt this production of
cutting-edge weaponry, which gains traction through a combinarion
ofadvanced material technology and detailed security risk calculations.
Interrogating the interconnections between knowledge, fantasy, and
ignorance as well as between fabulous and mundane political practices
helps us understand how power is made operative through
techno-scientific engagements with the seas.Just as importandy, it also
provides a path for challenging intractable---andoften deeply
unjust---configurationsofsovereignty. Introduction • [Temporal
Governance in the Anthropocene While the US military has been advocating
for a less risky sea, many scienrists claim that it is human activities
that have put the oceans at risk in the first place.]{.underline} In
2004, geologist W\^ill Steffen coined the term \"the Great
Acceleration\" to highlight how human activities, predominantly the
global economic system, became the prime drivers of change on earth. The
twenty-four graphs he chaned to express the acceleration in human
acrivity since the indusrrial revolution (see, e.g., StefFen et al.
1015) were foundational for the formalization ofthe Anthropocene
concept. According to these graphs, the oceans have been ameliorating
climate change, as well as other efFects ofhuman activity. Indeed, the
International Union for Conservation ofNature (lUCN) established that
more than 95 percent ofheat captured by greenhouse gases has been
absorbed by the oceans since the 19705. Ifthe oceans were not absorbing
this heat, the average global temperatures on land would be far
higher---aroundizi\"f--- instead ofthe current average of;9°F (Schlanger
2.017). In performing this ameliorating funcrion[, ocean ecologies have
become]{.underline} not only [an early casualty of the
Anthropocene,]{.underline} but also a bellwether ofwhat the future has
in store for the rest ofthe earth. Esrimating sea-level rise, scientists
predict that the oceans will encroach upon human settlements, flood
coastal cities, and shrink continents. English scholar Elizabeth
DeLoughrey writes in this regard: \"If there is any agreement about
climate change, it is that [our planetary future is becoming more
oceanic]{.underline}\.... Sea level rise is perhaps our greatest sign of
planetary change, connecting the activity of the earth\'s poles with the
rest ofthe terrestrial world, producing a new sense ofplanetary scale
and interconnectedness through the rising ofa world ocean\" (2.015,
553). In his recent book, The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking
Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World, journalistJeffGoodell
ofFers, similarly, that \"despite international efforts and tireless
research, there is no permanent solution---nobarriers to erect or walls
to build---thatwill protect us in the end from the drowning ofthe world
as we know it\" (1017, back cover). Catastrophe comes in other forms a.s
well. We are already witnessing the dramatic effecrs ofplastic waste on
marine ecosystems as media images ofwhales, turtles, and albatross with
stomachs full of plastics appear with ever greater frequency. In
addition to sea-level rise and pollution, scientists worry about what
they idenrify as the \"triple threar\" to marine ecologies: ocean
acidification, ocean warming, and deoxygenation (Rogers and LafFoley
2,015). Ocean acidification in particular i.s often referred to as
climate change\'s \"evil twin\' (Hollyjean Buck, this volume). Absorbing
elevated amounts ofcarbon dioxide 8 . Johnson and Braverman 218-81190
ch01 IP.indd 6/26/19 4:56 PM from the acmosphere, the changing chemistry
of the ocean is resulting in a decrease in the rates ofcaicification by
reeforganisms and thus in an increase in the dissolution ofthe
reefsediments that form reefstructures. Reefdisappearance in turn causes
an accelerated loss offish habitat and growing coastal erosion (Bakke
2,017,53-54). Oceanographer Sylvia Earle put it this way: \"Now we know:
Ifthe ocean is in trouble, so are we. It is time to take care ofthe
ocean as ifour lives depend on it, because they do\" (1014). Yet despite
the inevitable futures ofcollapsed fisheries and dead reefbuilding
corals, international climate and biodiversity treaties have largely
ignored the scientific evidence on ocean acidification. As Holly Jean
Buck shovvs in this volume, the complexity and relacive invisibility
ofocean acidification have made this process seem peripheral to the
massive anthropogenic changes in the oceans. Moreover, imaginaries
ofheightened planetary management have boosred scientific investments in
geoengineering techniques, thus strengthening narratives that figure
climate futures as technologically controllable. These efForts resonate
with the \"Good Anthropocene\" approach adopted by the Breakthrough
Insritute and other Silicon Valley optimists, in which humans figure as
the technologically endowed producers of a well-worked planet
(Asafu-Adjaye et ai. 1015). Consistent with the \"Good Anthropocene\"
approach, novel developments in biomedicine and the rise of the blue
economy have infused new value to the seas and their inhabitants. Rather
than seeing them as a grim casualty of human history, advocates ofthe
blue economy have indeed come to view the oceans as a resource for
sustainable technological and biotechnological enhancement (European
Commission 2.012.; Helmreich ioo7;Johnson 1016). In her chapter, \"Got
Algae?,\" Amy Braun shows how, as land resources dwindle, industrial and
venture capitalists harness sea life and matter for food,energy, carbon
sequestration, and generic resources. Utilizing practices of enclosure
and privarization---includingaquaculture, deep-sea mining, seaweed and
algae harvesting, and marine bioprospecting---thesentrepreneurs portray
oceans as utopian spaces oflimitless, yet sustainable, development.
Whether we are hurtling tovvard catastrophe or toward a \[echnologically
endowed utopia, [the future that figures in both the Anthropocene and
the blue economy literatures follows the modern understanding of time as
a linear, secular, and unidimensional passing from past to
future.]{.underline} In contrast to these universal accounts ofrime,
many ofthis volume\'s chapters reveal the rich polychronic natures of
the oceans. In Susan Reid\'s contribution, for example, the deep, slow
time ofthe seas\' geologic and evolutionary pasts calls inro question
basic assumptions of temporai progression. Specifically, Reid argues
that [by]{.underline} Introduction [encouraging a \"mine first, observe
and legislate later\" approach,]{.underline} [UNCLOS\'S instrumental
view of the oceans has enabled deep-sea mining operations.]{.underline}
Countering such approaches, she relates to the sea as a \"cogenerative,
transitional realm, thrumming with material agency and life.\" Reid thus
not only imagines more sensitive and durative parameters of livability,
but also shows how we might shift the foundations upon which policies
and actions are based. In her words: \"At a time when planetary
environmental systems are in srress and decline, there is a vital place
for new imaginaries with which we might all navigace and transition.\'
[Considering multiple temporal registers that move beyond the linear is
crucial for crafting the oceans\' new imaginaries.]{.underline} Michel
Serres\'s scholarship on nonlinear topologies is instrucdve in this
context. In an interview with Bruno Lacour, Serres compared time to a
handkerchief: laid flar, the distances between one point and another can
be measured. Crumpled in one\'s pocket, however, \'two distanr points
suddenly are close, even superimposed\" (Serres and Latour i99S\> 61).
His most evocative passage on nonlinear time references the movement of
water: \"Beneath the Mirabeau Bridge flows the Seine .. . \[But\] all
the water that passes beneath the Mirabeau Bridge will not necessarily
flow out into the English Channel; many little trickles turn back toward
Charenton or upstream\' (58). For Serres, what we often consider history
is not necessarily in the past. Patterns and norms laid down in time
can, much like water, circulate in eddies and whirlpools or flow back
upstream. As the recent political climate demonstrates, blind faith in
temporal and social progress is often erroneous---and dangerous.
[Christina Sharpe\'s In the Wake]{.underline} (2016) [highlights how
such temporal currents are lived in the present.]{.underline}
Specifically, Sharpe uses the multiple meanings of the term wake to
consider how past violence continues to resurface in the lives of
African Americans today and how [persistent forms of trauma and terror
followed slave boats sailing across the Atlantic.]{.underline} [The past
that concerns Sharpe, in which some lives are **designated as
ungrievable by law and made unlivable in practice**, is in fact never
past.]{.underline} Similar to Serres\'s understanding, in this context,
too, the past \"reappears, always, to rupture the present\" (Sharpe
1016, 9). In the wake, [**\'the semiotics of the slave ship continue:**
from the forced movements of the enslaved to the forced movements of the
migrant and the refugee, to the regulation of Black people in North
American streecs and neighborhoods, to those ongoing crossings of and
drownings in the Mediterranean Sea, to the brutal colonial reimaginings
of the slave ship and the ark; to the reappearances ofthe slave ship in
everyday life in the form of the prison, the camp, and the school\"
(2.1). Immigration and asylum policies and legal regimes also formalize
and solidify traumatic ocean routes.]{.underline} Following boats that
carry migrants across the io • Johnson and Braverman 218-81190_ch01
IP.indd 10 6/26/19 4:56 PM Mediterranean and elsewhere, one finds
dehumanizing legislation being forged in Europe, in the United States,
and in Australia. In their wake, death tolls mount while the lives of
survivors are displaced, suspended, and often made unlivable through
detention and poverry (Lyons 2.018). [The connections between ocean and
terrestrial policies are clearly visible in the use of off shore
detention facilities, such as Australia\'s Christmas and Nauru Island
camps]{.underline}. There, asylum seekers await justice with little
recour.se to human rights laws (Coddington zoi8; Mountz and Loyd 1014;
Welch 1014; Zeweri 2.017). Other violent pasts and toxic legacies also
threaten to reemerge in the ocean. In Astrida Neimanis\'s chapter,
\"Held in Suspense,\" the potential rupture ot past into present haunts
contemporary politics around the Baltic Sea. Following World War II,
hundreds of thousands of tons of unused chemical warfare agents were
dumped into the Gotland Deep. While contemporary legal regimes prohibit
such dumping, at the time, this form ofwaste management was considered a
safe and viable solution to the problem of disposing of unused
munitions. The sea was viewed as a limitless repository, a blue hole
inco which unwanted terrestrial things could simply be made to
disappear. But the past has in fact not passed. What was dumped then is
now resurfacing. Uncertainties around the severity and timing ofthe
chemicals\' reemergence, Neimanis finds, incapacitate legal resources so
that matter and law are simukaneously \"held in suspense.\" The problem
is not a technical one, she emphasizes; it does not rest in the
inability of science or the law to address the waste ofthe Gotland Deep.
It is, rather, one ofresponse-ability (Haraway 1008). The turbulence of
ocean histories and materialities thus forces a response to the violence
ofpast, and present, displacements. Recognizing the complexity ofour
potentially catastrophic ecological ftitures requires, in Neimanis\'s
words, \"that we must find ways to call ourselves to account, ro enact
an ethics of curiosity and care, to do politics even ifwe know they are
always incomplete.\" For Neimanis, even such incomplete attempts to
alter the ecologically and politically degrading status quo are crucial
ifwe are to work toward social and ecological justice. [**A Sea of Lines
and Laws** Alongside the temporal distinctions,]{.underline} other
turbulent boundaries---such as those between land and sea, water and
ice, and atmospheres and waves--- threaten to upend the \"static and
binary divisions that so often characterize legal rhetoric\" (Philip
Steinberg, Berit Kristofferson, and Kristen Shake, this volume). While
international law [attempts to account for the unique characteristics of
the oceans]{.underline}, their fluid properties and countless
indeterminacies Introduction • have resulted in claims tha.t oceans
\"resist inscription\" (Boucquey et al.1016, 8). Still, myriad
inscriptions---scientific,legal, and cultural---proliferateand overlap
across ocean space, establishing, undoing, and redoing its boundaries.
The 1982. UN Convention on theL aw of the Seas ([UNCLOs) is undoubtedly
the most comprehensive contemporary inscription of ocean sovereignty,
jurisdicrion, and use.]{.underline} UNCLOS is a monumental treaty with
\^zo articles divided into 17 parts that establish normative concepts,
such as the 12,-mile territorial sea, the loo-mile Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEz), the high seas, and the seabed and ocean floor beyond
narional jurisdiction (or \"the Area\"). [Mapping the ocean
into]{.underline} these [multiple zones and jurisdictions, UNCLOS
sketches the political geography of today's oceans and sets up the
normative framework that governs it.]{.underline} [While it attempts to
hold open legal space for oceanic indeterminacies, it simultaneously
creates and fixes inscriptions across the seas. UNCLOS\'S jurisdictional
powers lie in its acknowledgment and ratification by territorial
nation-states]{.underline}. In this sense, it is both reified and
constrained by the legal and political powers that have created it.
Under UNCLOS\'S jurisdictional matrix, national sovereignty typically
diminishes with increasing distance from land. While the nearshore
territorial sea confers full national sovereignty over both the ocean\'s
surface and water column and the ocean bed, the EEZ delineates a hybrid
bundle of spatial rights and responsibilities farther offshore
(Katherine Sammler, this volume). In that ico-mile-wide ribbon, coastal
states maintain sovereign rights to pelagic and sessile resources while
surface waters are international (UNCLOS, Articles 58 and 87). Yet
farther offshore, beyond the EEZ, the ocean surface and the water column
are referred to as the high seas.\" Here, freedom reigns as \"No State
may validly purport to subject any part ofrhe high seas to ks
sovereignty\" (UNCLOS, Article 89). Meanwhile, any national claims on
the seabed beyond the EEZ (i.e., in \"the Area\") have been
categorically invalidated by UNCLOS in an effort to protect it as a
\"common heritage of mankind\" (UNCLOS, Article 156). British geographer
Stephen Graham describes this way of governing as the \"classical,
modern formulation of Euclidean territorial units jostling for space on
contiguous maps\" (2.004, lo). Further attempting to reinforce UNCLOS\'S
role as protectorate of life, the U N is currently negotiating a new
regulatory platform for the deep sea, with special emphasis on marine
biodiversity and the expansion of marineprotected areas beyond narional
jurisdiction (Payne 1017). Issues of conservation in the deep seabed
have provoked a crisis in national sovereignty, invoking questions about
how to transform a space previously characterized by freedom, with
relatively limited regulation, into a space with enhanced protections
for sea life and matter. ii • Johnson and Braverman 218-81190 ch01
IPindd 12 6/26/19 4:56 PM Notably, the Euclidian demarcation ofspace was
integral co the hi.story of ocean governance well before the
establishment ofthe UN and the ratification ofuNCLOS. The tremendous
investment by early Western administrations in inscribing the seas is
detailed in Zsofia Korosys chapter, \"Whales and the Colonization ofthe
Pacific Ocean.\" There, she shows how eighteenth-century [cartographic
techniques demarcated spaces of sovereign legal authority in the
seas]{.underline}. [Such eighteenth-century renderings of ocean space
enabled colonial expansion on land as well]{.underline}. [By \"allowing
both seen and unseen spaces to be conceived as congruent wholes within
defined boundaries,]{.underline}\" Korosy writes, [cartographic
representations of both sea and land legitimized colonial fantasize
about sovereignty over terrestrial areas scarcely known. The violence
that followed---perpetrated against ocean-dwelling whales and
land-dwelling humans alike]{.underline}---[catalyzed new ways of viewing
the land as a repository of resources to be extracted, used, and abused
with legal authority.]{.underline} The [methods of demarcation and
geographical reasoning developed in the eighteenth century are just as
central to ocean governance today. In their chapter, \"Edges and
Flows,\" Philip Steinberg, Berit KristofFersen, and Kristen Shake
examine the mapping of Norway\'s icy northern waters. They describe how
locating the ice\'s edge **has become a practice of translating what is
fluid and indeterminate into fixed and knowable borders**. As Steinberg
and his coauthors show, legal reasoning intensifies and reifies
cartographic inscriptions by insisting on \"stable definitions and fixed
distinctions.\" The project of ocean inscription thus creates, in their
words, \"a world of lines and laws.\" By defining the boundary between
fluid and solid states, cartographers and legislators have effectively
erased the physical indeterminacy office from the map, making the Arctic
more governable for resource extraction. Just as Korosy\'s
eighteenthcentury cartographers produced lines and laws to facilitate
the extraction of fuel in the form of whale blubber, the Norwegian
government has been remapping its border zone in order to expand oil
extraction in the Arctic. Such practices in lines and laws reveal a
mounting tension in ocean governance: on the one hand, the seas are
configured as a global common; on the other hand, they are perceived as
providing a repository of globally profitable commodities.]{.underline}
This tension has long underpinned the establishment and negotiation
ofmarine space and its correspondinglegalities (Snyder and St. Martin
1015). Few modern concepts have been as influential in stoking this
tension--- and for the development oflaw, political science, economics,
or environmental studies in this context---asGarrett Hardin\'s \"Tragedy
of the Commons\' (1968). Hardin\'s vision ofa depleted commons has
dominated legal discussions about how to govern public spaces and has
frequently been deployed in the Introduction concexr of marine resources
(mainly fisheries) and marine pollution (Ranganathan 2.016). Global
contributions to ocean waste and to the spread ofmicroplastics are often
considered perfect examples of Hardin\'s tragedy. But as legal scholar
Surabhi Ranganathan notes, conservation efforts that vilified common
resource management in the seas have ended up sparking legislarion that
dispossessed both indigenous and settler communities from critical
resources. In other words, Hardin\'s concept inadvertently set the stage
not for more sustainable management, but for more efficient extracrion
(Ranganathan 1016; see also Locher 2.018; St. Martin 1009). The tension
between resource protection and exploitation underpins many ofthe legal
frameworks for ocean governance. The establishment and expansion of [the
juridical continental shelf and the EEZ have been viewed as emblematic
of this tension.]{.underline} In 1945, former US president Harry Truman
cripled the resource claims ofthe United States, thereby startingthe
race for sovereign expansion (DeLoughrey 1015, 555). This was one ofthe
first assertions ofexclusive jurisdktion beyond the traditional
territorial seas. The post-1946 reasoning of the ocean constituted \"the
most dramadc change to global mapping since the post-World War II era of
decolonization\" (555). It is no wonder, then, that the [postwar ocean
zones have been viewed as the ultimate symbol of the twentieth-century
neocolonial scramble for the oceans]{.underline}. The development
oftechnologies that enabled the exploitation ofminerals in the seabed in
the 19605 intensified that scramble. Most nocable was the newfound
ability to mine manganese nodules at the depths ofover three thousand
meters (Harrison 1015,37). The [rise of seabed mining in the twentieth
century radically reshaped the ocean]{.underline}: rather than being
merely a \"navigational surface or fishingcommons,\" the [seabed became
a constellation of\'places for fixed capital investment\" (Ranganathan
forthcoming)]{.underline}. The [efforts to capitalize on minerals and
fossil fuels beneath the seabed have been so rapid that they have
triggered a legal revolution (]{.underline}Harrison 2.015, 57). Ongoing
technological advances allow developed countries to excavate the seabed,
resulting in what developing countries have often referred to as
neocolonial ocean grabs (Pinkerton and Davis 2.015; see also
Ranganathan, forthcoming). In light of [these
transformarions]{.underline}, it is difficult to view the demarcations
established [by UNCLOS]{.underline}, and [promoted through other
cartographic efforts]{.underline}, as fixed and stable. Instead, [the
oceans have become the latest Wild West---a frontier playground for
exertions of national sovereignty and power that extend logics of land
into sea]{.underline}. Beyond this scramble for existing territorial
anchors to extend their reach through legislation, nation-states are now
also extending the land itself into the ocean, with significant legal
implications. Jennifer Gaynor\'s chapter in this i4 • Johnson and
Braverman 218-81190 ch01 IPindd 14 6/26/19 4:56 PM volume shows,
accordingly, how increasingstate capture and contestations over resource
extracrion in Southeast Asia have driven island and coastal sraces to
engage in massive terraforming projects. These projects ofsand
redistribution stretch and transform legal distinctions between land and
sea, and international court tribunals are called upon to adjudicate
which landforms count as territory, with entitlements over adjacent
waters, and which are merely rocks and sand. Clearly, then, there is
much at stake when inscribing boundaries and binaries onto the sea and
decisively distinguishing land from vvater. By historicizing and
problematizing legal borders, this volume contribures to the telling
ofmyriad ocean stories with the aim offurrheringprotective policies.
Along these lines, Katherine Sammler\'s chapter, \"Kauri and the
Whale,\" studies the controversies over New Zealand\'s Foreshore and
Seabed Acr of2.004, which has enabled the excraction ofseabed minerals.
[This]{.underline} legislation [has generated much friction between two
clashing worldviews: one embracing a Western land/sea binary, the other
based in indigenous Maori tradition]{.underline}s that assign holistic
customary rights extending from mountains to sea. According to Sammler,
i[ndigenous ontologies provide alternative ways of governing that
challenge the essentialism of national sovereignty and that can better
accommodate the fluidity of oceans.]{.underline} Instead ofseeing the
oceans as a fixed Euclidean space within which power is exercised, this
worldview ushers in a \"wet ontology\" that allows for mobility within
and between noveljurisdiccions (Steinbergand Peters 1015). [Such a wet
ontology would]{.underline} arguably diversify and [expand the potential
for \"postcapitalist waterworlds,\" supporting efforts to decolonize the
seas (]{.underline}DeLoughrey 1015,559; see also St. Martin 2.009).

[The blue economy is an emerging concept that has been heralded as a new
approach to ocean governance, and refers to a broad set of policies
aiming to support ocean-based economic activities that provide simul
taneous improvements for economic, social, and environmental out comes
\[]{.underline}1\]. Even as the idea of the blue economy has gained
popularity, it is not very well understood and is contested in
(inter)national arenas \[1,2\]. The versatility of the concept means
that some advocates are using it to describe oceans as economic
frontiers, whereas others emphasise the ocean's unique biodiversity that
needs to be protected e.g. \[3--5\]. This has led to many different
interpretations and definitions of the concept, from a variety of
different actors. The blue economy has such ambiguity that it can be
difficult to specify its influence on policy and practice. Business and
economic-growth focused interpretations of the blue economy -- often
propagated by economically powerful states and in dustry -- emphasise
innovation, entrepreneurship, and close collabora tion with the private
sector, paralleling approaches common in its terrestrial counterpart,
the green economy \[1,2\]. It also holds the same optimistic belief in
growing the economy and protecting the environ ment simultaneously,
which has been argued to obscure trade-offs in favour of supposed
win-win outcomes \[6,7\]. As such, blue and green economy share a
foundation in ecological modernisation thinking, \* Correspondence to:

Policy 132 (2021) 104673 2 whereby economic growth and environmental
protection can go hand-in-hand through incorporation of environmental
issues into mar kets \[8--10\]. By proposing that win-win outcomes are
achievable through "modernising modernity" \[10\] and reliance on
technology and innovation, ecological modernisation has been argued to
further pro mote a profit and growth paradigm, obstructing the
[fundamental change required to achieve actual sustainability
\[7,11,12\]. Indeed, blue economy discourse asserts that "since a large
proportion of marine resources is believed to have remained untapped or
unexplored \[.\] future growth will be contingent on the efficient
utilisation of those rich ocean resources" \[13\].]{.underline} Specific
untapped or unexplored ocean resources that have received recent
attention are oil and gas and deep sea minerals \[14\]. It remains
unclear how a concept that has received considerable critique and
struggles with seemingly paradoxical aims, still remains dominant in
contemporary seascapes. How do proponents of the concept maintain and
employ power to keep the blue economy relevant, and how does the
reconfiguration of oceans as economic frontiers contribute to this
power? Drawing on insights from neo-Gramscian theory, com bined with a
focus on local power relations, we explore how the blue economy gains
influence, and what the power of the increasingly hegemonic blue
modernisation narrative enables or constrains. We first examine how [the
blue economy as a concept serves to maintain hegemony,]{.underline} and
then focus on how social interactions in national governance settings
contribute to maintaining a consensual power dynamic. 1.1. Conceptual
framework Both at the global stage and in national governance settings,
the blue economy has the status of a boundary object. Boundary objects
are con cepts that can be applied in a structured way in specific
situations, but are also versatile enough to appeal to many different
actors as an idea \[15\]. They frequently occur in environmental
governance, taking the shape of e.g. resilience, natural capital,
ecosystem services or green infrastructure \[16--19\]. These kinds of
concepts, which have a strong degree of plasticity in their meaning,
take on the role of bridging boundaries -- that is, they facilitate
cooperation between different social worlds \[16,20\]. The blue economy,
with an interest in economic, social, and envi ronmental issues
simultaneously, benefits from being a broad concept, finding supporters
in different arenas e.g. \[6,16,23,24\]. However, as a concept, the blue
economy -- like many classical boundary objects -- navigates a thin line
between being versatile and inhibiting explicit discussions about
incompatible interpretations \[23\]. Whilst boundary objects "allow
different groups to work together without consensus" \[20\], for the
blue economy this also means that its status as a boundary object allows
it to appear apolitical. It seems apolitical because, through its very
plasticity, it can stifle debate around the difficult choices and
trade-offs that can be made between the three different dimensions of
the blue economy. Yet, this vagueness that obscures choices does not
automatically mean that the concept as a representation is not useful
\[20\], or that it is not making things happen. Boundary objects can
become a source of power when they serve to create a 'common sense' in
which conflicting interests are resolved rhetorically \[24\]. We adopt
the Gramscian concepts of passive revolution and hegemony, because they
offer a useful approach to studying how challenges to dominant economic
systems are neutralised and absorbed \[7\]. Hegemony refers to the
non-coercive power of the ruling class to secure their position through
ideology as common sense \[25\], and has recently received attention in
political ecology to explore the role of ideology in shaping
environmental governance and practices \[26\]. It is no coincidence that
conceptualizations of human-nature relationships play an important role
in maintaining the hegemony of capitalism: indeed, it has been argued
that the ability to achieve hegemony relies on the proposed approaches
to environmental governance \[27\]. [In]{.underline} green and [blue
economy approaches, the argument of win-win situations has worked to
neutralise arguments about limits to growth]{.underline}, muddying
trade-offs be tween economic and environmental sustainability[. As
such]{.underline}, capitalist [hegemony is maintained, allowing for
continued and even accelerated exploitation of what is now called
natural capital]{.underline} \[7\]. Key to the concept of passive
revolution is the influence of international support forged by powerful
states, which places less powerful states on the receiving end of
developments and ideas from other countries \[24\]. These less powerful
states subsequently incorporate aspects from the hegemonic model, which
facilitates the expansion of its ideology \[28\]. What constitutes 'the
state' is increasingly expanded to include international civil society,
in which a transnational system of production and financial institutions
such as the World Bank and the IMF play an important role in global
hegemony \[24,28\]. The blue economy can be seen as a new iteration of
the passive revolution facilitated by the green economy, in which the
hegemony of capitalism is further embedded into oceans. [Oceans, more
than terrestrial ecosystems, are often conceptualised as
placeless]{.underline}, regarded from land as 'out there' \[29\]. This
has led to images of oceans as dangerous and chaotic areas of
wilderness, [frontiers to conquer,]{.underline} or as places to traverse
\[30\]. A view of oceans as separate from land, and humans, is
instrumental in blue modernisation: maintaining modernity's separa tion
of humans and nature, [reconfiguring ocean spaces into new and contested
territories that are simultaneously new economic frontiers and areas of
enclosure]{.underline} \[30,31\]. In doing so, the emergence [of the
blue economy has been observed to facilitate continued capital
accumulation \[32\]]{.underline} [by offering technology and innovation
as a way out of frictions and conflicting interests caused by the
territorialisation process of]{.underline} the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea ([UNCLOS]{.underline}) \[33\]. However, at the
national level, more is needed than a hegemonic ideology in order to
steer conduct, which is why combining neoGramscian thinking with a focus
on power in social interactions can be useful \[34\]. The blue economy
internationally has attracted atten tion, and the governments of
countries like Seychelles have aligned themselves closely with the idea.
However, in order to open up the process of negotiating power relations,
it is necessary to acknowledge that power in environmental governance is
not just about state coercion, and rather about "who gets what, when,
and how" \[35\]. In order to explore this power through social agency, a
closer look is needed at the specific context and social relations
within national environmental governance \[34\]. Power can therefore be
approached as something that is productive: rather than being something
that can be accumulated, it is making things happen and can be traced as
such \[35\]. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study site Seychelles has been
a pioneer in promoting the blue economy in national and international
contexts, most prominently through former president James Michel, who
continued the agenda-setting work of Seychelles' Ministry of Foreign
Affairs since 2011 \[36\]. The emergence of the concept was accompanied
by the formation of a Blue Economy Department \[37\], with jobs and
events and a communication strategy that is currently being drafted. In
addition, the blue economy and its focus on innovation and
entrepreneurship has inspired new ways of finance. The first oceanic
debt-for-nature swap took place in Seychelles \[38,39\] and has resulted
in the creation of the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation
Trust (SeyCCAT), whose goal is to "competi tively grant at least US\$
750,000 per annum \[or 0.044% of 2018 GDP \[40\]\] to support the
stewardship of Seychelles' ocean resources, island life and blue
economy" \[41\]. Within this context, human use of ecosystem services
informs the Marine Spatial Plan (MSP), which in volves stakeholder
consultations to identify and map potential benefits from the different
zones in the Seychelles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). These served as
layers in the spatial planning process that resulted in the designation
of different marine zones (highly protected, M.S. Schutter et al. Marine
Policy 132 (2021) 104673 3 medium protected and sustainable use, and
multiple use zones) \[42\]. Seychelles' political economy has recently
undergone considerable neoliberal restructuring as a democratic state,
emerged from a previ ously socialist country with a largely closed
economy \[43\]. These changes have been particularly pronounced in the
Seychelles approach to marine governance, which has been reoriented to
enthusiastically engage with the blue economy \[1,44\]. Marine
environmental gover nance has seen an increased reliance on
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for practical implementation and
monitoring, especially after a structural adjustment intervention by the
International Monetary Fund in 2008, which necessitated cuts in
government spending \[45\]. 2.2. Interview approach The lead author
conducted face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 29 people in
roles of formal decision-making across the fisheries sector, economic
development and tourism sector, the conservation and environment sector,
and specific blue economy institutions (Table 1). Sampling followed a
snowballing approach to connect to as many actors as possible involved
in policy and practice around the blue economy in Seychelles. The
interviews took place in the context of a larger project, during which
the lead author spent a total of 4 months in Seychelles, and which
included 130 household interviews and 50 resource user in terviews.
Therefore, data collection followed a mixed methods approach, consisting
of observations and impressions from the field in addition to the 29
interviews. Most interviews took place in the respondents' places of
work, of fering an opportunity to obtain more contextual information.
Perhaps unsurprisingly in a small country like Seychelles, ministries,
de partments and NGOs are run by small groups of people. It was common
for government departments to only consist of 3--5 people, and re
spondents expressed difficulties finding enough human resources to run
their affairs, further complicated by a constant flux of personnel
changes. The small scale of governance also made it possible to easily
access actors at relatively high levels of organisations, such as
principal secretaries and directors. In addition to shortages in
personnel, organi sations face financial constraints. Reduced government
budgets after the austerity measures in 2008 mean that (international)
environmental NGOs have come to play a large role in environmental
governance, through their own agenda-setting work, and by representing
interests of their funding sources. One example of such involvement is
the role that The Nature Conservancy played in the development of the
debt-fornature swap. This prominent role of predominantly environmental
NGOs seems logical when considering their financial clout vis-a-vis \`
that of Seychelles' government, as well as their access to (academic)
knowledge through international networks. Their role is also reflected
in the sectoral distribution of our interviews: fewer NGOs in the
economic development and tourism sector, combined with limited
government capacity, made it more challenging to find respondents. This
distribution could mean that more critical voices are reflected in our
respondent pool, and that supportive voices from the economic
development sector are underrepresented. Interviews were recorded and
transcribed, and together with observational notes from meetings,
presentations and discussions coded into emergent themes. These were
themes that linked both to [power of the blue economy as a
representation of hegemonic ideology]{.underline}, and its translation
into on-the-ground interactions that determine imple mentation outcomes
(i.e., the negotiation of power in social in teractions). Emergent
themes were analysed to explore how actors viewed the blue economy
concept in an international context, and how they perceived Seychelles
to play a role in international discourse. We further zoomed in on the
process by which Seychelles aligned with the concept, and considered how
this alignment was influenced by the power of international hegemony but
also facilitated Seychelles to carve out a role for itself as a pioneer,
gaining attention in the process. In addition, the data were analysed
for themes that gave insight into local processes of decision making. We
were mostly interested in tracing so cial interactions, therefore we
focused on data that spoke about re spondents' relationships with
others, and their interaction in fora such as the MSP process. The lead
author's positionality inevitably influenced data collection and
analysis. As a researcher from a high-income country in the global
north, it was possible to navigate between different spaces of power,
gaining access to actors on different sides of the emerging debates.
During the interviews, it became evident that many of the actors were
engaging in unique conversations, and shared more with the researcher
than they would have with their peers. This dynamic created a mutual
opportunity: as a researcher, the lead author was able to collect data,
and the respondents were able to promote their views. The timing of the
interviews (in 2017--2019) had a positive impact on this access, as blue
economy policy-making was still in the early stages of articulating its
aims and meanings. Although political tensions were present, they were
less pressing than they later became, when elections were approaching,
and implementation of the blue economy began to be more evident. 3.
Results and discussion It is clear that the blue economy concept is
maintained as influential by persuasion rather than coercive force,
through the use of the concept as a way to rationalise governance and
achieve economic, environ mental and social goals at once \[31,32\].
Here, we respond to calls for attention to the social relations that
play a role in changing people's subjectivities and relationships with
the oceans and that maintain the blue economy concept on the ground
\[32\]. We found that, despite literature describing a sense that there
are critical voices as Seychelles is shaping the blue economy \[44\],
there is a lack of public dissent on the ground. Common themes that
emerged from interviews and observa tions were: the pervasive role of an
international concept that supports the visibility and influence of
Seychelles; the function of the boundary object status in obscuring
trade-offs and facilitating depoliticisation and communication; and
related to that, consensus on the phrase (the term blue economy is used
widely) but not on its content, which shows a simmering discontent that
is expressed only privately. As a result, the concept, having achieved
hegemonic status on the international stage through its persuasive and
all-encompassing character (the promise of triple wins), persists as
influential in decision-making at the national stage. 3.1. The blue
economy as negotiation for power The emergence of the blue economy as a
powerful narrative cannot be seen in isolation from interstate politics,
achieving its power through persuasion and consent rather than coercion,
leading to hegemony of ideas \[24,25\]. Consent is achieved through
absorbing challenges to the dominant socio-economic order by providing
an attractive and inter nationally supported alternative narrative. The
adoption of [the blue economy]{.underline} as a new conceptualisation of
the ocean as a (sustainable) development space was thus expressed in
Seychelles: "The blue econ omy \[\...\] [embraces]{.underline} the vista
of untapped potential that is available through enhanced exploration and
sustainable [exploitation of our oceanic spaces"]{.underline} \[46\]. As
such, [the blue economy offers a way to align oneself with the hegemonic
core, incorporating a blue modernisation]{.underline} Table 1 Number and
distribution of interviews across sectors. Sector Number of interviewees

104673 4 [narrative that supports the maintenance and expansion of
global eco nomic growth]{.underline} \[26\]. In international arenas,
Seychelles and other countries aligned with the blue economy concept
speak with a voice of enthusiastic support for "transforming oceanic
spaces into development spaces" \[47\]. The blue economy has become an
important project to be associated with, providing legitimacy and
relevance at the international stage and opportunities for 'innovative
finance'. The concept has become further established as hegemonic by the
promise of triple wins and its presentation as a logical and rational
approach. Respondents commonly mentioned that interest in the sus
tainability of the oceans seemed to be de rigeur at the moment and that
it seemed logical to jump on the bandwagon: a government representative
in the environment sector said that "\[...\] right now there is a lot of
in terest in ocean matters, it seems like the resources are going
towards those things."3 Thus, consensus is created, which has been
argued before to serve hegemony when people "come to accept the
hegemonic project as their own even though in critical terms the project
serves to reproduce the dominance of the ruling elite." \[34\]. Power
thus does not rely on coercion but on consent, and the 'common sense'
created by interna tional blue economy discourse relies heavily on
presenting the blue economy as a rational and modern way of
environmental governance. As such, the term carries agency, as local
actors feel compelled to use it and perpetuate the discourse: "Even my
\[strategic document\] talks about the blue economy, but if somebody
comes and does a review and asks me "what have you done with the blue
economy?", I would have to scratch my head and say I'll get back to you.
And then I have to go and see what we have done and try and get a link
with the blue economy, stretch it to the limit."4 This seemingly
pragmatic adoption of the concept leads to the tacit consent that is a
key component of Gramsci's passive revolu tion: the stimulus to
incorporate this new approach to ocean governance comes from growing
international support which has the power to "transmit their ideological
currents" into national governance settings, where they work to prevent
radical change \[24\]. The power of global capitalism is further
solidified by the 'opening up' of national economies and interventions
such as structural adjustment programmes \[48\], both of which have
taken place in Seychelles. 3.2. The importance of the blue economy at an
international stage Not only is the blue economy presented as common
sense, but it is perceived as actively serving Seychelles' geopolitical
interests. Through its weight on the international stage, countries that
embrace the blue economy concept find themselves at the centre of a new
wave of ocean governance. For Seychelles, the concept has meant
increased interna tional attention, an opportunity to present itself as
a pioneer on a global stage, and in doing so gain influence and draw in
finance \[44\]. The blue economy has put Seychelles on the agenda, as
evidenced by mentions from the World Bank, and the Commonwealth e.g.
\[49,50\], as well as by recurring themes during interviews.
Interviewees mentioned that "Government will say that the MSP, SeyCCAT
and the debt swap are all part of the larger blue economy agenda, but
what the blue economy is mostly doing is raising the profile of
Seychelles." 5 One senior IGO representative said that "Everyone is
talking about it; it is good PR", 6 indicating both the sheer volume of
blue economy ideas being promoted and the sense that the concept is
useful -- it carries outwork (delivering good public relations) for
those that use it. In addition, the blue economy appeals because of the
promise of a new source of income: "It shows that it can bring in
money". 7 Bringing in money is important in Seychelles, because despite
the country's graduation from a developing state into a high-income
country, Seychelles is still vulnerable to external environ mental and
economic shocks \[51\]. By embracing the blue economy concept early and
enthusiastically, Seychelles has also positioned itself as a site of
blue economy lobbying for external actors. The country has been a
location for pioneering and showcasing innovative finance promoted by
the World Bank through their Blue Bonds \[52\]. Within the blue bonds
context, Seychelles offers impact investment opportunities to investors
and an opportunity for the World Bank to publicise their development
philosophy. Other actors lobbying for a blue economy agenda in
Seychelles are (international) environmental NGOs. Embracing the concept
of natural capital, the blue economy offers new opportunities for NGOs
to engage with the private sector. This is evident from the use of the
Seychelles case as a 'proof of concept' for marine debt-for-nature swaps
\[39\]. In addition to agenda-setting and financial opportunities,
engaging with the blue economy can also offer international actors an
opportunity to expand the legitimacy of various ocean-based sectors
\[53\]. Particularly the tuna industry -- an important economic pillar
in Seychelles but also one that struggles with the paradoxical aims of
sustainability and economic growth \[54\] -- can benefit from the
capacity of the blue economy concept to absorb these challenges and lend
a 'sustainable' image to the industry. Considering the role that fleets
from the European Union play in West ern Indian Ocean fisheries, it
seems fitting that the EU's blue growth innovation strategy tends to
favour the growth potential of industrial fisheries over sustenance of
small-scale fisheries \[55\]. The power of persuasion and the benefits
that the blue economy offers in terms of influence and income has meant
geopolitical compe tition between states. Other countries were mentioned
as competitors in the blue economy context, for instance Kenya:
"Seychelles is the blue economy champion of Africa, yet Kenya is now
pulling the lead in a position paper for the African Union. Kenya is now
able to hijack the conversation."8 The importance of maintaining the
status of pioneer and champion of the concept was also mentioned: "Maybe
it's part of the whole competitive thing, that we have to keep this blue
economy, because it keeps you relevant, it keeps your activities in view
of every body else and then they still engage with you."9 The blue
economy has come to play an important role in Seychelles 'Creole
diplomacy' and is seen as instrumental for successful foreign policy
\[36\]. As a result, actors that are enrolled in the now hegemonic
project are actively working to maintain it, as the ties to this
internationally successful project have become instrumental in
maintaining (perceived) geopolitical influence. 3.3. Maintaining
consensus on the ground In 2015, the blue economy became
institutionalised in Seychelles as a department under the Ministry of
Finance, Trade and the Blue Econ omy, aiming to coordinate all
ocean-related activities of other de partments and ministries \[37\].
This aim articulates the potential of the blue economy as a boundary
object, allowing different departments to coalesce. The blue economy's
status as a boundary object enables widespread adoption and acceptance,
despite (or perhaps due to) the absence of a clear definition of the
term. The most common theme encountered in interviews was the lack of
clarity on what the blue economy actually is. One senior
Intergovernmental Organisation (IGO) interviewee stated that "it is not
very clear what they mean. It is an amorphous concept". 10 A local
resident expressed this by stating "I don't think anybody knows fully
what it means". 11This ambiguity in the concept works to muddy
contradictions inherent to capitalist expansion, 3 Government

raising support for the idea that continued and accelerated exploitation
of oceans is indeed possible (and necessary) at the same time as more
environmental protection. The lack of clarity has also meant that the
promise of 'triple wins' and 'more money for everyone' could be
maintained, hiding trade-offs and suggesting that the blue economy has
something for everyone, "enough to ensure conformity of behaviour in
most people most of the time" \[28\]. Furthermore, a senior blue economy
official mentioned that embedding the Blue Economy Department within the
Ministry of Finance at that time served as a "carrot": the promise of
financial ben efits from the blue economy would lure in the various
other de partments.12 The blue economy's status as a boundary object has
an impact on the ground in two ways. First, consensus is maintained
through employing the blue economy to depoliticise discussions, a
strategy that finds fertile ground where there are historical tensions
and a lack of trust. Second, although dissent is indeed present in
Seychelles, the blue economy has been positioned as an object within
multiple stakeholder consultations in planning and implementation. This
posi tioning has further depoliticised the debate and trade-offs,
thereby manufacturing consent. Maintaining consensus is important,
because it allows for the continued use of the concept which has not
only become powerful in a hegemonic sense itself, but also offers power
to Seychelles in terms of visibility and relevance. The process of
negotiation at the national level provides an avenue for exploring how
power relations are employed to maintain the delicate balance between
support and oppo sition for the blue economy \[35\]. 3.4. Historical
tensions and distrust interact with contemporary governance Boundary
objects are useful in climates where trust and communi cation are
difficult, precisely because they require no consensus for groups to
continue to be able to work together \[20\]. This is especially useful
in places like Seychelles, which in the past featured a strong and very
present state \[43\]. During the interviews, despite a focus on the blue
economy, some respondents spent time explaining the history of internal
politics in Seychelles, as an important part of understanding domestic
interactions with the blue economy concept. Historically, Seychelles has
struggled to separate politics and the state; although the one-party
system has been abolished, the shadow of the ruling party's power still
hangs over public life and political allegiances were still believed to
influence citizens' opportunities in life \[56\]. Although the
opposition gained control over the National Assembly in 2016, and in
2020 even secured the first opposition victory in presidential elections
\[57\], these are recent developments, and the blue economy in
Seychelles remains tied to president Michel and his formerly dominant
party. Several interviewees linked the political context to a culture of
distrust responsible for suspicion and a lack of communication, and
suggested that this has caused a refusal or inability to explicitly
discuss trade-offs and choices in the blue economy. Respondents spoke
about a fear of offending others, which inhibits explicit discussions,
and sug gested that this might be a leftover from the one-party state
and coup d′ ´etat. Indeed, one interviewee explained holding back in
discussions in order not to escalate disagreements, and said: "sometimes
you're scared of being negative, you want to respect other people's
views", 13 and another described the delicate balance as follows:
"\[...\] for example with the MSP, we have to be very careful, we don't
want to be in someone's way, we don't want to be too tainted you know."
14 The result is that not many people are publicly critical of the blue
economy. Rather, there is a simmering dissatisfaction with the currently
hegemonic status of the concept. 3.5. Manufacturing consent through
depoliticisation In Seychelles, the MSP process and the consultation
process for the blue economy roadmap have served to depoliticise
environmental governance through a focus on the technical process of
planning. There were mentions of "meetings for the sake of meetings", 15
during which no explicit discussions on choices within the blue economy
took place. In terviewees spoke of a lack of meaningful engagement in
stakeholder consultations, reflecting what Flannery et al. \[58\] call
"choreographed participation". For example, one interviewee said: "There
are so many processes \[...\] that are just there to validate some fait
accompli. They say they will do stakeholder consultation, and they just
want you to fill out an attendance sheet \[...\]. I've attended most of
the meetings and when I look at the report, it says they had concluded
the stakeholders' consultation successfully. \[But\] I cannot remember
one meeting that ended with a handshake."16 Although the sentiments
expressed by stakeholders indicate disagreement with the process as well
as the content of blue economy-inspired governance, respondents did not
see their dissent reflected in real changes. Indeed, time constraints
often meant that there was no space to express concern: interviewees
lamented for instance the fact that the Blue Economy Roadmap
consultation took place "at the end of a full day \[...\] it was a
Friday, from 4 to 6 pm."17 Again, discussion on a vision for the blue
economy and trade-offs was stifled by its status as a boundary object,
offering the illusion of collaboration whilst actually depoliticising
the debate. As a result, consensus takes the shape of the manufactured
consent of stakeholder consultations \[58\], in which the hegemonic
ideology of the blue economy takes precedence over explicit discussion
of trade-offs. Playing into historical tensions and interpersonal
relationships, the blue economy in Seychelles 'performs' to provide a
sense that there is no politics, thereby enacting the depoliticisation
discussed above. Although the blue economy as a boundary object has
facilitated the navigation of tensions, "\[t\]he problem of rhetorics,
however, is that a strategic choice \[of a boundary object\] is always a
constitutive choice also." \[16\]. By reproducing hegemonic notions of
human-nature relations, the blue economy brings these notions into
existence as a 'new' reality \[59,60\]. As a performative concept, the
blue economy is making things happen -- namely, the unloading of the
'new' blue economy onto an existing ocean-based economy. As a boundary
object, the blue economy does something: it offers a new and seemingly
depoliticised space where there is no need to discuss trade-offs, but
instead triple wins can be achieved. Although processes of
depoliticisation and triple win fantasies ensure conformity and buy-in,
they also mask the performative effect of the blue economy in
reproducing and entrenching hegemonic framings of reality \[60\].
Moreover, the worldviews and images thus promoted translate into
conceptions of reality that influence governance, thereby shaping
reality itself \[61\]. 3.6. Finding counter-hegemony Blue modernisation
reconfigures oceans as new economic frontiers and places of enclosure
simultaneously \[31,62\]. The combination of the important role of the
blue economy in giving Seychelles a platform internationally, the appeal
of win-win situations and the use of the boundary object to facilitate
depoliticisation means there is no coercion but rather a consensual
agreement that comes about through the use of the term. However, this
does not mean that the concept is not contested. Narratives of oceans as
placeless frontiers are difficult to sustain at the implementation phase
of the blue economy, where resource users are actually closely connected
to and familiar with oceans. In addition, although trade-offs may be
avoided at the discursive (inter)national 12 Government representative.

Schutter et al. Marine Policy 132 (2021) 104673 6 policy levels,
on-the-ground implementation will have to make much clearer the impact
on resource users and others. A boundary object cannot itself be
implemented, and local political models are more difficult to adopt than
hegemonic ideology, leading to the contradictions and contestations at
the local level \[28\]. In this light, it is not surprising to find
dissatisfaction with the ideas and processes of the blue economy in
Seychelles. Indeed, from earlier research a sense emerged that
Seychelles was shaping the blue economy, and resisting aspects of the
international discourse \[44\]. However, the international influence of
the blue econ omy and the dominant economic paradigm it represents,
combined with social power relations, tend to shut down discussion and
participation. This combination of structural and social power relations
has led to an impasse in terms of where the blue economy should go: a
lack of a shared vision. The question is: where might alternative
visions, or counter-hegemony, come from? In Gramscian terms, structural
changes in world-order, and therefore challenges of hegemony, are always
rooted in social relations in national societies and political orders
\[24\]. This means that establishing counter-hegemony against the blue
econ omy can only happen through the alliance of those that are disadvan
taged by it \[28\]. Civil society has been identified as an important
place where resis tance and counter-hegemony can be formulated and
advocated \[63\]. But the tendency to expand the state to include
international civil society at the cost of local civil society \[28\],
reduces opportunities for critical engagement (and potential for
counter-hegemony) in the blue economy. In Seychelles specifically, civil
society associations were long prohibited \[56\], and an interviewee
mentioned that still, "civil society is not strong enough; they do not
realise their potential." 18 The potential for critical civil society
engagement is further reduced by the post-political manner in which MSP
is often implemented and presented as impartial and rational \[64\]. In
Seychelles, the consultations that do take place suffer from "pressure
to get it implemented", 19 which reflects academic critique on
consultation as depoliticisation. Consequently, consultation can
actually serve to produce apparent consensus that keeps dissent at bay
when it only allows for disagreement on specific technology and
management choices, not challenging the expansion of a capitalist
socio-economic order \[65,66\]. As a result, as far as civil society is
pre sent in Seychelles (mostly in the shape of foreign-led environmental
NGOs), they tend to be embedded in the hegemony of dominant groups. The
lack of strong voices coming from local civil society feeds into a lack
of meaningful engagement of the blue economy with resource users. This
lack of engagement means that the problematic configuration of oceans as
placeless frontiers where economy and environment can coexist, cannot be
effectively challenged by resource users. Meanwhile, Seychelles speaks
with one voice on the blue economy in international settings, obscuring
tensions between diverse interests locally. During the interviews,
respondents spoke about "policy incongruencies in the country, where you
have a national company actively licensing, and encouraging, exploration
of oil and gas, and a trust fund that has been established to look at
\[climate change\] adaptation and conservation." 20 These policy
incongruencies indicate the contradictions that come to the fore at the
national level, such as extractive non-renewable industries and seabed
mining co-existing with conservation and sustainable livelihoods. The
emergence of counter-hegemony in Seychelles is therefore constrained by
a perceived need to align with hegemonic ideology, and the not yet
realised potential of local civil society. However, if hegemony spreads
from within national societies, counter-hegemony can also develop
elsewhere and challenge world-order \[28\]. Indeed, counter-hegemonic
currents are rising outside Seychelles, most notably in South Africa,
where the negative consequences of blue economy-inspired growth have
been argued to be felt acutely by small scale fishers, who are trapped
between uneven economic development and competing conservation interests
\[67\]. In this context, the move ment for 'blue justice' has emerged
\[68,69\], which points at contra dictions in the blue economy concept
that often result in marginalisation of small-scale fisheries. Blue
justice advocates for the recognition of small-scale fishers' rights to
access and participate equitably in the blue economy \[67\]. Other
arenas of resistance revolves around the role of fisher peoples in
safeguarding food sovereignty \[70\] and blue degrowth \[71\]. There
have been calls for the blue economy to return to its original aims as
put forward by small island states -- placing social equity at the
centre of any blue economy-related plans \[72--75\]. Engaging with
counter-currents around the blue economy could also serve as an avenue
to bring the blue economy back to these original aims. By using
relational power on the ground, displaying resistance and forming
associations, local resource users can engage with "alternative
institutions and intellectual resources \[...\] while resisting the
pressures and temptations to relapse into the pursuit of incremental
gains" \[28\]. Within this context, international expansion of Too Big
to Ignore's push for blue justice and fisher peoples' mobilisation of
food sovereignty in fighting 'blue grabs' is helpful \[67,70\]. However,
because power in so cial relations and power in structures of hegemony
are interlinked \[34\], resistance at the local level would need to
accompany international movements, to re-politicise decision making at
home. Moreover, despite increasing resistance against neoliberal
hegemony more broadly, there are many examples of the expanding
influence of neoliberal approaches \[76\]. The blue economy might be the
newest iteration that further en trenches neoliberalism into small-scale
food production. 4. Conclusions [The blue economy has widely gained
influence at the international stage, and ties in with the hegemonic
regimes of contemporary global environmental governance]{.underline}. It
has become influential through persua sion and consent, and the boundary
object status is useful to facilitate communication but also to offer
something to everyone. The triple bottom line promise creates an
appealing sense of progressive change, benefiting the economic,
environmental, and social dimension simul taneously. Interest in the
blue economy is further fuelled by framings of the ocean as
underdeveloped and underexplored \[31,62\], and in need of rational
management. The blue modernisation narrative thus absorbs issues
associated with the ocean economy (e.g. coral bleaching, pollu tion,
industrial overfishing). It avoids "challeng\[ing\] the factors causing
our ecological ills" \[77\], constituting a passive revolution of
continued and even accelerated exploitation through closing off pathways
to alternative trajectories \[66\]. The emerging conceptualisations and
proposed [ways of governing oceans also determine who is considered to
be connected to the ocean]{.underline}, and consequently, which
stakeholders have a voice in blue economy debates. The lack of a culture
of local civil society engagement and the ambiguity in the concept means
that local engagement in Seychelles has proven difficult. Instead,
voices from the international civil society have managed to gain
positions of influence, strengthened by the increased reliance on NGOs
in marine environmental governance following eco nomic restructuring and
cuts in government budgets. In Seychelles, the blue economy offers a way
of finding common ground in an environment that is characterised by
political tensions, as well as environmental and financial pressures.
However, blue modern isation also means a choice for a profit and growth
paradigm, and an obstacle to alternative approaches for environmental
governance. The current approach in marine spatial planning in
Seychelles' blue econ omy tends to avoid political discussions that
would enrich democracy. This can mean that activities such as
small-scale fisheries are overlooked or even discarded as something that
people need to be 'developed out of', thereby marginalising these
activities instead of recognising their 18 NGO representative.

contributions for food security and employment \[69\]. In Seychelles,
there is an intellectual weariness when it comes to discussing the blue
economy with resource users. The concept enables current power relations
to prevail and even to be entrenched: the participation of
'stakeholders' is choreographed, and the beneficiaries of innovative
financing and public-private partnerships are not marginalised groups
but the powerful elite. However, this does not mean that resistance is
absent: competing interpretations and critique on the concept have been
found in Seychelles before \[44\]. Nevertheless, from an outside
perspective the critique appears to be expressed only in private. For
counter-hegemony to truly emerge, resistance needs to find its way into
public dissent. Open discussion about a shared vision for the blue
economy requires the recognition of small-scale fishers' and other
resource users' rights that is proposed in the blue justice movement
\[67,68\]. There is a need to un pack the term blue economy, to discuss
what a shared vision would look like, and to re-politicise environmental
decision-making. Rather than aiming to achieve consensus through
rational dialogue, space should be allowed for disagreement that might
emerge from participation and consultation \[78,79\]. The multiple and
increasing pressures on and demands from marine ecosystems demand
political and explicit dis cussion of the values and images attached to
the blue economy.

[As a result of Finland's NATO membership, Northern Finland has become
not only a major NATO frontline with Russia and an important access
point in the Arctic but also a hub for Arctic warfare training in a
landscape that is similar to Russia.]{.underline} In my own everyday
life in Rovaniemi, a small Finnish university town and the capital of
the Lapland province known internationally as the home of Santa Claus,
militarisation is omnipresent. The noise of fighter jets taking off from
Rovaniemi airport at an increasing frequency dramatically affects the
town's soundscape; the presence of Finnish as well as international
military personnel in shops, hotels and restaurants during large joint
exercises; long military convoys on the roads connecting towns and
military facilities; and a constant exposure to stories in the media
framing local and regional news, or development, or whatever topic that
can possibly be given such a twist, in terms of military considerations
and defence. This all works to normalise the prospect of war in the
middle of peace time.

This kind of militarisation of my everyday also means that I understand
my surroundings in a new way. Today, I am aware that some of the hills
in and around Rovaniemi may hide large weapons storage facilities, as
well as one of the Finnish Defence Forces' two control and reporting
centres. I have learnt that the *SantaPark* theme park, 'the home cavern
of Santa Claus', doubles as the region's only public bomb shelter, and
that the serene lake and hill view at our summer cottage hides a large
radar station central for Finnish air defence, hence, a likely first
target. I am also aware that once Finland officially approves the
Defence Cooperation Agreement that it has already signed with the United
States, my hometown could become home to US troops. Among the 15
designated areas, the agreement lists two sites in Rovaniemi: Rovaniemi
airport and Rovajärvi firing range 40 kilometres east of Rovaniemi. They
are listed as sites not only open for US military use, but areas where
restricted *US only* zones may be established. Curiously, public
information and debate on the matter remains non-existent. Military
geographies (Woodward [Citation]{.underline}2004) advance in secrecy.

Given all this, I was not surprised that the Finnish National
Broadcasting company YLE in April 2023 published an article titled 'This
is how NATO looks like in Finland: interest to train in Lapland is so
high that queues pile up' (Fresnes Tulikukka and Martikainen
[Citation]{.underline}2023). What caught my attention, or feminist and
decolonial curiosity, however, was [the justification for the growing
international interest in military training in Lapland. According to a
military expert interviewed, Lapland and especially the Rovajävi firing
range is attractive because, unlike in other sites: 'there is plenty of
space, you can put a lot of troops in there, and it doesn't disturb the
civilians'.]{.underline}

In other words, the article [seemed to construct the area as an empty
space, as no-one's land - *terra nullius*]{.underline} - that is up for
grabs because no one, supposedly, is using it, at least not in ways
recognised by the appropriator. The discourse of [terra nullius has been
central to]{.underline} especially [European conquest of other peoples'
lands]{.underline} since the time of the crusades and leading up to
full-blown colonisation on five continents, [including in the
Arctic]{.underline} region. [Today, it is still employed regularly in
Northern Scandinavia, for instance to justify invasive and broadscale
land use in the context of industrial and extractive mega-projects. The
planned mine in Gállok in Northern Sweden a few years back is a case in
point.]{.underline} There, the Beowulf Mining Plc's chairman Clive
Sinclair-Poulton sought to publicly undermine local and Sámi resistance
to the mine by asking the rhetorical question: 'What local people?'
while showing an aerial image of the Gállok forest landscape (see
Persson, Harnesk, and Islar [Citation]{.underline}2017). In this
instance, however, the strategic employment of the discourse of terra
nullius did not work very well. The remark provoked wide discontent
among the Swedish public, and eventually may have done more harm than
good to the mining company's case.

From a local, place-based perspective, there is scarcely any area in the
North that would not already be used by someone and for some purpose.
Rural areas have often historically been constituted as peripheries, and
as sites for natural resource- and/or settler-colonialism. In these
spaces, growing pressure on land use, as well as questions over who gets
to use it, and how, constitutes the backbone of social, political and
cultural identities and struggles, whether in defence of Indigenous and
traditional livelihoods and place-based identities, extractive
industries and communities, tourism, or whatever else. Since conflicts
over land use are also conflicts over local and regional identities and
futures, they tend to matter a great deal to civilians.

Just as the Hydra and Leviathan signal very diferent modes of governance
and diferent visions of the commonwealth, Foucault's essay envisions the
sea and its ships as radically other to the workings of government on
land. Within Foucault's writings, however, the seas themselves remain
abstracted, primarily serving as a space unburdened by the matters and
histories of territory, where one might imagine alternative political
formulations. What might happen to these considerations of sovereignty
and the commonwealth when we take the three-dimensional space of the
ocean more seriously? In what follows, I consider this question by
following how [the US Depart- ment of Defense (DoD) is developing
machinic technologies---notably en- dowed with the moniker Hydra---that
would enable a more distributed geopolitical security apparatus at sea.
I ultimately trouble the claims that ocean and land, as well as Hydra
and Leviathan, are oppositional in governance, finding instead that they
are interactive and coconstitutive---materially, legally, and
symbolically. This, I suggest, raises questions about the nature of
sovereignty and the future of what Hobbes referred to as the
commonwealth. Entangled]{.underline} Seas, Entangled Futures The mission
of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa), the DoD's
research and development arm is [to create "breakthrough]{.underline}
[technologies for national security.]{.underline}"1 But the agency's
role is perhaps best captured by the epigraph on its "About" web page, a
quote by composer Franz Liszt that reveals darpa's true purpose is to
"cast a javelin into the infinite spaces of the future." As the
placement of Liszt's quote suggests, darpa is [a national defense agency
unlike any other: rather than predicting and responding to an imagined
politi- cal landscape to come, darpa seeks to chart a course into the
"infinite spaces of the future." B]{.underline}y seeding science and
innovation, they also direct them and, thereby, hope to give our
collective future definition through scientific and technological
enhancement.2 With what kinds of technologies is darpa [hoping to shape
the "spaces of the future"? What futures]{.underline}---indeed, what
worlds---does it seek to build for our collective inhabitation? The
media and academy have lavished attention on the ways that aerial drone
technology has reshaped warfare as well as geopoliti- cal borders
(Chamayou 2015; Kindervater 2017; Shaw 2016; Shaw and Akhtar 2012). But
new programs are also expanding into the spaces on, below, and above the
ocean's surface. Under the moniker of the Hydra program, darpa is
working to build unmanned autonomous vehicles (uavs) capable of per-
forming surveillance and reconnaissance, detonating underwater mines,
and delivering various payloads in international waters. Launched in
2013, Hydra is one of many research and development programs in unmanned
maritime vehicle (umv) technologies. [It is meant to ameliorate the core
problem faced by the US Navy: the seeming imperative to "cover vast
regions of interest around the globe" while fewer forces and budget
restrictions shrink the size of the fleet overall (darpa n.d.b). darpa's
Hydra program envisions a floating, unmanned infrastructure of modular,
interchangeable parts.]{.underline} In the words of the darpa project
description, Hydra would enable "faster, scalable and more cost-efective
deployment of assets wherever needed" (darpa n.d.b). In what follows, I
chart a transition in sovereign imaginaries of and on the sea. Rather
than emanating from territorial land, [I find that sovereign power
increasingly attaches to technological objects and the algorithms that
operate them]{.underline}. Throughout this chapter, I analyze darpa
program calls and descriptions as well as naval planning documents and
technoscientific publications germane to US naval strategies. The
documents that imagine those technologies utilize and challenge existing
ocean legalities and visions of sovereignty. Contrasting darpa's Hydra
project with conventional understandings of sovereign power and the
commonwealth, I consider how the rise of machinic warfare is reshap- ing
ocean space and statecraft. darpa seeks to bring future visions to life
through the creation of umv technologies. These technologies are part of
eforts to "secure the volume" (Elden 2013b) of underwater space and
extend the dominance of the US mili- tary across and among the
continents. Yet military technologies and the forms of spatial dominance
to which they strive are fragile compositions at sea (as well as
elsewhere). Following Philip E. Steinberg and Kimberley Peters's call to
consider the "turbulent materialities" of the ocean (2015, 247), I think
in this chapter with the militarized sea as a three-dimensional space.
But the mate- rial processes of the militarized ocean also connect with
turbulent materialities and imaginaries well beyond the seas[. darpa's
ocean technologies take shape in laboratories and research sites in
connection with the "underlying churn" (Peters 2015, 248; see also the
introduction to this volume) of military histories, fears of the deep,
and transnational legal infrastructures, none of which are stable. Far
from infinite, therefore, these militarized "spaces of the future" are
tightly tied to matters, technologies, and legal frameworks created at
temporal and spatial distance.]{.underline} Paying attention to this
turbulent churn of imaginaries, materialities, and legislative
infrastructures raises important questions about who and what is brought
together into a common world by darpa's innovations. The rise of
autonomous technologies is a process that seems to decenter the human in
the making of machines and engender a security apparatus that appears to
be pre- dominantly composed of nonhuman actions (Shaw 2016). But
machinic tech- nologies do not remove human actions from geopolitical
engagements. Rather, they distance the work of humans from the immediacy
of battle to civilian sites of anticipatory innovation. And though the
military's future imaginaries and technologies are far from a fait
accompli, they play a significant role in recon- stituting sovereignty
and the [commonwealth by silently migrating ocean war- fare not only
into technological devices, but into the laboratories]{.underline} that
make them (see also Irus Braverman, this volume). Reshaping Warfare,
Reengaging the Seas Since the conclusion of the Cold War, the US
military has been unmatched in size and strength. Even as the number of
military personnel is almost half of what it was in 1955, the US
military's global dominance remains unrivaled. To maintain strength in
capacity, the US has turned to drones and other uavs to act as "force
multipliers" on the labor of the military workforce (US De- partment of
the Navy 2004, 13). By replacing human life with the machines[, the DoD
aspires to "maintain global dominance by doing far more with less"
(David Vine, quoted in Shaw 2016, 38).]{.underline} As many writing on
aerial drone technology have shown, advanced machin- ery like umvs does
not merely intensify existing military strategies; it trans- forms them
(Chamayou 2015; Gregory 2011; Kindervater 2017; Shaw 2016). Displacing
the battlefield as the site of military engagement, the machinery of the
drone has engendered what Derek Gregory has called an "everywhere war"
(2011). If battlefields were once geographically distinct, Gregory
argues, their borders have now been eroded. Efecting a particular bio-
and geopolitical cal- culus, endangerment and risk in the drone's
surgical strike are felt only on one side of this everywhere war. [The
executers of drone strikes sit removed, safely distanced from the
action, while bombs are dropped in Pakistan, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan,
and Somalia. There, the distinction between civilian and enemy combatant
or militant is made more or less indistinct. There, one's life is con-
stantly at risk. For this reason, Grégoire Chamayou refers to this
warscape of aerial drones not as an everywhere war, but as a planetary
"hunting ground]{.underline}" (2015, 52). 3 Just as aerial drones
shifted the logics and spaces of war, seagoing autono- mous vehicles are
changing military engagement at sea. The future ocean at work in darpa's
designs is not one of climate change and rising sea levels, re- source
contraction or expansion in the form of subsurface minerals or fisheries
(see Zsofia Korosy, this volume; Alison Rieser, this volume), or
[dramatic losses in biodiversity and dying coral reefs (see Irus
Braverman, this volume). Instead, the oceans are one of several milieus
of military engagement, where security and warfighting capacities might
be enhanced by technological innovation. At play in military imaginaries
are multiple marine epistemologies that can osten- sibly anticipate
future actions (Anderson 2010) as well as the reemergence of remembered
threats]{.underline}. darpa's Hydra program developed in response to the
US Navy's master plan for research into unmanned undersea vehicles
(uuvs) released in 2004. The eighty-page document reveals the navy's
strategic imaginary. The corner- stone of that imaginary is the
production of "network-centric warfare," what the navy refers to as a
Force Net (US Department of the Navy 2004). The Force Net and other
elements of the DoD's marine spatial imaginary reflect that of its
aerial and territorial counterparts and ensure access to land. As the
navy's uuv 2004 master plan establishes, [autonomous technologies are
designed to ensure that "the Navy be able to achieve and maintain access
to all the world's littoral]{.underline} at the times and places of its
choosing" (US Department of the Navy 2004, 31). The Office of Naval
Research (onr), often in conjunction with darpa, has been experimenting
with robotic technologies for decades. Throughout the 1990s and early
2000s, darpa funded the development of an assortment of small-scale
uuvs, many of which operate on principles of biomimicry ( John- son
2015). Robotic lobsters, clams, tuna, and crabs have marched (or swum)
forth from darpa's cofers to demonstrate the potentials of robotics in
mili- tary security. Although many of these technologies never advanced
past proto- type, new uuv technologies are less experimental and more
real-world ready. darpa is building on those earlier projects to
reimagine the potential of au- tonomous robotic engagement within a
wider ocean space and amid a broader range of war-fighting capacities.
darpa's uuvs operate according to a somewhat diferent calculus of life,
death, and geopolitical risk than do aerial drones. For the US naval and
marine forces, securing the spaces of the sea with our terrestrial-bound
human bodies has long been a challenge. Basic human needs for air, fresh
water, food, and space have always limited movement across the seas.
Warships, aircraft carri- ers, and submarines---until recently
technologies necessary to sustain life and warfare on or beneath the
waves---represent some of the most capital-intensive infrastructure used
by the US military. Traditional warships, for example, cost upward of
\$700,000 US per day to operate (Merchant 2015). Such a fleet is not
only costly, but ponderous: aircraft carriers and warships are
incompatible with an ongoing, globally distributed war that calls for
"just in time" capabilities. Replacing peopled warships with autonomous
systems could save millions: one report estimates that autonomous
systems could operate at only \$15,000 to \$20,000 per day. darpa's
Hydra is imagined as a network of machinic agents capable of pa-
trolling the waters without necessary input from a central command. The
nine- headed serpent of Greek mythology with the powers of regeneration
serves as its emblem. Hydra would create a coordinated modular system of
networked autonomous vehicles and weapons capable of engaging sea, air,
and land. As the original agency announcement on the program explained,
Hydra would provide "a novel delivery mechanism for insertion of
unmanned air and under- water vehicles into operational environments"
(darpa, n.d.b). If successful, the program would result in the
deployment of a fungible container vehicle, referred to as the
mothership, capable of coordinating smaller umv and uav operations in
sea and air space. Several related projects are also part of the Hydra
mission, including darpa's Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node
(tern) program and the Raytheon-produced six-pound Switchblade drone
that can morph from an underwater submersible to a workable aerial drone
capable of taking flight from the surface of the sea (figure 9.1). If
darpa's javelin into the future is reshaping the space of naval
battlefield, it is also shifting governance and broader geopolitical
strategies. In doing so, darpa utilizes and responds to existing ocean
legalities as well as the turbu- lent movement of the seas. In darpa's
strategic documents, the oceans appear on two registers. In the first,
the high seas serve as a surface of engagement. There, umv technologies
extend not only the capacities of human warfighters, but also sovereign
control over global space. Extended via seacrafts networked across the
earth, the imagined future US naval fleet will utilize the legal status
of the high seas to expand its access to distant regions. In the second,
the DoD builds strategies and technological futures around the materials
within the sea. Here, the sea appears as a three-dimensional or
volumetric space (Elden 2013b), "churning," as Steinberg and Peters have
written, with material and temporal dynamics that must be abided. In the
two sections that follow, I show how the Hydra program and the DoD's
wider eforts to produce a future of autono- mous warfare are [hitched to
these two visions of the sea. Seacrafts and Statecrafts: Buoying Empire
on the Surface U]{.underline}nited States territory hosts no foreign
armies, yet it operates bases in almost eight hundred locations. These
bases produce a network of US military forces that span the globe,
efecting an empire of "lily-pads" from which the US can launch military
operations on a just-in-time basis (Vine 2015a). As David Vine has noted
(2015a), maintaining such a network is resource heavy and fraught with
tension. International base infrastructure requires constant diplomatic
negotiation with host nations and often results in international
pressures as well as anti-American sentiment in host countries. In some
cases, US bases are housed within the territories of dictatorial and
autocratic regimes. In others, the governmental arrangements that permit
US bases on foreign soil are ludi- crously complex and decidedly
undemocratic. In Thailand, for example, private contractors---and not
the Thai state---negotiated the creation of Utapao Naval Air Base south
of Bangkok (Vine 2015b). With the umvs of the Hydra pro- gram, the DoD
hopes to turn the international status of the high seas into a tactical
opportunity capable of circumventing these issues. The United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea ([unclos)---which is in efect, although
the US has never ratified it---divides the ocean into seven zones. Of
them, five are subject to the jurisdiction of coastal nation-states to
varying degrees: internal waters, the territorial sea, contiguous zones,
exclusive economic zones (eezs), and continental shelves. As noted
elsewhere in this vol- ume, coastal states have full sovereign control
over their territorial seas, which extend twelve miles from the
coastline and include everything from the air above the water to the
seabed and subsoil (unclos 1982). Here, "ships of all states," including
submarines, warships, and (presumably) umvs, maintain the "right of
innocent passage.]{.underline}" That is, they may traverse the surface
of the sea, their flag in view, in ways that are not "prejudicial to the
peace, good order or security of the coastal State" (unclos 1982,
Article 31). Behaviors considered "prejudi- cial" obviously include the
threat of force, exercise of weapons, or launching of aircraft. But
unclos also prohibits the collection of information, the carrying out of
research, or any activity that would jeopardize the environment of the
coastal state (unclos 1982; see also Jessica Lehman, this volume). The
final two zones, the high seas and the deep seabed, are not subject to
the jurisdiction of any one state. These vast expanses of ocean space
remain governed as a common in accordance with Hugo Grotius's principle
of mare labarum (see Alison Rieser, this volume). There, all
ships---whether fishing boats, warships, or umvs---"have complete
immunity from the jurisdiction of any State other than the flag State"
(unclos 1982, Article 59). Accordingly, umvs can operate a range of
missions, from research to military exercises, without the express
permission of other states (Showalter and Manley 2009). The hope is
that, by using umv technologies to fan out across the high sea, a
combination of umvs and aerial drone technologies will allow the US Navy
access to the world's coasts (at least, at a distance of only two
hundred miles), where they might respond to threats as they emerge. That
is, they hope to cre- ate [the conditions for constant and continuous
surveillance of the shorelines of every continent. Envisioned through
the Hydra program, therefore, is not only a global empire of military
power,]{.underline} but also a decoupling of warfare and sovereign
territory. In this military imaginary, the production of a networked,
floating infrastruc- ture of autonomous components would unground the
navy's and air force's war-fighting capacities: territorial bases and
resource-intensive aircraft carriers would no longer be needed as
operation launch sites for weapons or drones. Hydra would network the
globe into a system of floating, mobile bases capable of rapid response.
By utilizing the status of the high seas, the US dreams of breaking the
links between military might and diplomacy. Ian Shaw has written that
aerial drone strikes show how the "reach of state power is clearly not
tied to the fixed territory of the state," but, rather, is "mobile and
global" (2016, 14). The rise of umvs take this even further, to
demonstrate how state power also operates on the back of material
objects that float through the fluid substrate of the sea and the broad
legal infrastructure that is unclos. Requiring neither land nor
diplomatic agreements with other nations states, umv programs would,
contra Shaw, not render US geopolitical reach "bound- less" (Shaw 2016,
146). They would instead affix US military force to material
technologies rather than land masses. This is a machinic, mobile
extension of the surface logics of landed territory [mapped over the
legal status of the high seas. Here, sovereignty and geopolitical power
are made on top of technological objects and the algorithms that operate
them.]{.underline} By ungrounding military power and loosening the
constraints of sovereign territory, land is not rendered irrel- evant
but is redistributed to the sea through these floating objects of
military significance. The imagined future built by umv technologies
thus promises to shift geopolitical space and retie the knots between
land and sovereignty on the back of mobile technologies. Turbulent
Oceans, Anticipatory Threats The strategic and tactical advantage of umv
technologies goes beyond the extension of sovereignty onto adrift
technological objects. Through machinic innovation, the DoD also
exemplifies Stuart Elden's volumetric geopolitics (2013b), [showing how
the nation-state mobilizes political power below the surface as well as
on it.]{.underline} The Navy's umv master plan and darpa's program docu-
ments envision sea depths as a stratum of threats---both known and
potentially emergent. Here, we find that the oceans are, indeed, a
"hunting ground." But unlike sites of engagement in air and over land,
the objects of the hunt are more diverse and predominantly nonhuman.
Other autonomous seacrafts, subma- rines, missiles, and underwater
mines---recently laid and long buried---are the DoD's primary concerns.

### 1NC -- FONOPS

#### Freedom of Navigation Operations serve to reinforce hegemonic control over the blue. The desire for free navigation is inextricably linked to colonial blue desires. The US led "rules based order" is thus code for the expansion of cartographic control and imperial power.

[In the course of a few years, the long-standing contention between the
developed and developing states over the extent of the freedom of the
seas versus the enclosure of the ocean, inherent to UNCLOS, became
reframed. Specific concerns related to the freedom of navigation were
equated with UNCLOS as a whole, which, in turn, became a proxy for
'international order']{.underline}. Paradoxically, [this strengthening
emphasis on the 'rules-based order']{.underline} went hand in hand with
the emptying from meaning of the already ambiguous term. Concrete
problems with international law and UNCLOS as a whole got marginalized
in the heated debates about frequently deployed and therefore
increasingly abstract notions of 'freedom' and 'rules-based
order'.Intensifying contestations over territorial control in the South
China Sea stirred Australian anxieties and led to the reaffirmation of
Canberra's 'strategic interests' in the region. When, in April 2012, a
Philippine naval vessel's inspection of Chinese fishing boats near
Scarborough Shoal led to a prolonged stand-off, the then Australian
Foreign Minister Carr stated that Australia does not take sides. Yet,
with clear reference to China's reluctance to abandon the so-called
nine-dash line, an ambiguous and also within China debated (Wang,
Citation2015) claim to the entire South China Sea, Carr emphasized that
'we do, given our interest in the South China Sea, given the fact that a
large proportion of our trade travels through it, \[...\] call on
governments to clarify and pursue those claims and accompanying maritime
rights in accordance with international law including the UN Law of the
Sea Convention' (BBC, Citation2012). Subsequently, the Liberal
opposition party and a number of strategists called upon the government
to become more active in resolving the dispute, because 'the South China
Sea is Australia's single point of greatest strategic vulnerability'
(Callick, Citation2012). Meanwhile, Beijing continued to raise tensions
when it established Sansha City as a political entity with formal
jurisdiction over disputed waters (Callick, Citation2012). The reason
why Australia should be worried and become involved more strongly,
according to one major newspaper, is the fact that Sansha City sits
right at the centre of a 'freight freeway', through which 'two-thirds of
Australia's exports and almost half of its imports, about \$273 billion
worth of goods, are carried through the South China Sea' (Callick,
Citation2012). Just as Carr's earlier assertion and countless official
reiterations of it, the article did not mention that this trade is
mostly between Australia and China and that Beijing itself increasingly
anxious about its so-called 'economic lifelines' would have scant
interest in disrupting them (Laurenceson, Citation2017; Noer & Gregory,
Citation1996). An apparent next step in China's strategy to control what
its leaders regard as theirs, and not Japan's, Beijing in November 2013,
declared an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China
Sea. Foreign Minister Bishop (Citation2013) made clear the Australian
'opposition to any coercive or unilateral actions to change the status
quo', while calling in the Chinese ambassador for further explanation.
This led to a spat with China and brought the strengthening defence ties
of the Abbott with the Abe government of Japan into focus (McGrath,
Citation2013). At the same time, mostly due to fears that the ADIZ'
curtailing of the freedom of overflight might establish a precedent,
calls for Australian FONOPS through the newly established ADIZ and
public demonstrations of 'support for allies who do so to avoid the
emergence of a new status quo where China rules its surrounding seas'
became louder (Slevison, Citation2015). Assertions that 'inaction has
the potential to encourage China to declare a South China Sea ADIZ in
the foreseeable future' (Slevison, Citation2015) added urgency. The
revelation in September 2015 that China had been reclaiming land and
building large facilities on several disputed rocks and reefs in the
Spratlys caused widespread consternation and unsurprisingly provoked
strong criticism. While asserting Australia's 'legitimate interest in
the maintenance of peace and stability in this part of the world,
including the preservation of respect for international law, unimpeded
trade and freedom of navigation', the Australian Minister of Defence
expressed 'opposition to any coercive or unilateral actions to change
the status quo' in the South or East China sea, including 'any
large-scale land reclamation activity' and the prospect of the
artificial structures' militarisation (Andrews, Citation2015). This
rekindled talk about the possibility that the Abbott government would
send a surveillance plane over these facilities, thereby conducting
Australia's own FONOPS. Rory Medcalf (Citation2015), a prominent
proponent of a moderately assertive stance, also known for his advocacy
of the 'Indo-Pacific' geopolitical concept, argued that 'Australia
cannot pretend that what happens in the South China Sea is none of its
business' because: As a middle power, Australian security ultimately
depends on a rules-based regional order ... Damage to that order through
coercion or unilateral assertiveness as we have seen in these contested
waters in recent years, equates with damage to Australian interests.
Australia's lifelines, its trade routes to and from some of its top
trading partners, including China but also Japan and South Korea, run
through or close to those waters -- as do the sea lanes on which the
commerce of much of the world depends. Yet, Hugh White, a former defence
official well known for his advocacy of a new, the so-called concert of
powers giving China more and better seats at the tables of world
politics, pointed out that it was not clear whether China's land
reclamations were a threat to the FoN or to international law and that
the confrontations resulted from the US and China competing over primacy
in the Asia-Pacific. For him, the debate was about the US and Australia
trying to figure out whether or not and how to use these islands as a
means to draw a 'red line' for China's growing regional influence
(White, Citation2015). Similarly, Sam Bateman (Citation2015a), a former
naval officer and one of the foremost experts on Asia-Pacific maritime
affairs, opined that: Australia's direct national interests aren't
involved with overflight in the South China Sea in the same way as they
are with navigation and overflight through the \[Indonesian and
Philippine\] archipelagos to our near North. Furthermore, China hasn't
made clear which restrictions on navigation and overflight it's imposing
around features it occupies in the South China Sea. ... As well as
provoking China, that gesture would be seen in the region as Australia
simply acting once again as a 'deputy sheriff' to the US in the region.
In line with legal experts at the US Naval War College (Dutton & Kardon,
Citation2017), Bateman also pointed out that the issue is politically
and legally rather complex because[: US FONOPS in that area seemed to
focus only on Chinese actions;]{.underline} the legal status of the
challenged features -- some installations would only have 500m safety
zones, others, classified as mere rocks only constitute 12NM territorial
seas, etc. -- is unclear; most features are claimed by several coastal
states, naval presence in territorial seas my violate the laws on
innocent passage, and because FONOPS risk provoking dangerous maneuvers
that may endanger the safety of seafarers if not performed at the
highest levels of seamanship (Bateman, Citation2015b). Indeed, a year
later, an arbitration panel in The Hague denied several of the features
claimed by China and patrolled by the US the legal status of a 'rock',
and thereby ruled that they would not even be entitled to a 12NM
territorial sea (PCA, Citation2016, p. 472). The US had been engaging in
some sort of legal shadow-boxing. The judges' differentiated reasoning
on a limited set of legal questions notwithstanding the award had a
profound impact on the political debate. As Nick Bisley (Citation2016)
had already pointed out before it was handed down, the general mood was
that 'something must be done' against the expanding Chinese presence in
the South China Sea. Despite that most experts deemed their legal
utility at best unclear (Raymond, Citation2016), and the prospect of
rising tensions assured, this something was Australia's own or
participation in Washington's FONOPS programme. In particular, exponents
of the Labor opposition deemed the government's policy of continuing
routine surveillance operations (Greene, Citation2018) and enhanced
bilateral and multilateral naval diplomacy insufficient (Massola,
Citation2016). Strikingly, these arguments for a more 'robust' military
posture, while triggered by Chinese violations (specific
interpretations) of UNCLOS, were not made with reference to
international law, but to geopolitics. Medcalf's (Citation2016, p. 10)
just as the Defence Minister's concerns with the FoN seemed to rest
foremost with alliance politics that is a particular notion of
international order, when pointing out that it was the joint
Australian-US-Japanese condemnation of Chinese actions that mattered
most, noted that 'the tensions in the South China Sea are testing
American resolve, credibility and diplomatic dexterity' and that 'the
United States is the ally on which Australian security deeply depends,
and therefore, these are tests for Australia too' (Medcalf,
Citation2015). Rothwell (Citation2017) was even clearer in this when he
stated that the [US FONOPS' first 'primary purpose' is 'to protect the
mobility of US forces and to ensure that they can move freely between
oceans, which has been critical for the maintenance of US naval
hegemony']{.underline} and that 'Australia wouldn't wish to be
constrained in its naval movements in coming to the aid of regional
friends and allies because of China's position on warship navigation
through the South China Sea'. In fact, the ways in which they are
conducted, FONOPS could well produce the opposite of the intended
effects, also in terms of coastal states' compliance with UNCLOS and the
recognition of territorial claims (Bateman, Citation2017; White,
Citation2017). This prevalence of geopolitics explains the vast
exaggeration of the importance of 'Indo-Pacific' sea lanes for the
Australian and the US economy, for instance by the defence minister
(Andrews, Citation2015). Since US-bound commerce is, at best, marginally
reliant on Southeast Asian waterways and since Australia relies on them
only for a fraction of its trade, overwhelmingly for iron ore and coal
exports from Western Australia -- to the very China that is supposed to
threaten them (Laurenceson, Citation2017) -- [the assertion of the FoN
in the 'Indo-Pacific' cannot but refer to the FoN for
warships.]{.underline} After all, this geographical term had long been
standing for the theatre of operation of the US Pacific Command, which
was renamed US Indo-Pacific Command in June 2018. Moreover, the
'Indo-Pacific' brings together India, Australia, Japan and the US, whose
'shared democratic values', according to the then Commander US Pacific
Command, place them best to safeguard 'freedom, justice and the
rules-based system' at the present 'inflection point in history'
(Harris, Citation2017). In short, China had become an imminent threat to
the established 'liberal rules-based order' (Wroe, Citation2016). To
clarify the nature of that order, to understand why Australian
authorities see it worth defending with military force, it is necessary
to put the notion of order into the broader historical and security
political context.

Geopolitically, demarcating the borders of ocean jurisdictions granted
under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (unclos)
has stabilized many international disputes over ocean resources and
boundaries. [Ofshore jurisdictions conceived by unclos are delineated as
distances from coastal baselines, marking a fixed land/sea line of
reference. Yet Aotearoa New Zealand has struggled with translating and
implementing unclos, as many in the country question the very division
of territory and property along a land/ sea binary. New Zealand
legislation written to determine rights and respon- sibilities ofshore
has sparked fierce debates and protests, demonstrating not only the
ambiguity within the multiple understandings of ocean space written into
unclos, but also that this treaty is categorically incompatible with
other ways of knowing and practicing ocean spaces. Specifically, the
coastline bisec- tion and subsequent nationalization of submerged lands
is in direct conflict with Indigenous Māori cosmologies and tribal land
rights that interpret land- scapes and seascapes as an interrelated
whole. Environmental politics stem- ming from this worldview call into
question dominant Western and colonial epistemology and ontology and
inform radically new frameworks for deriving sovereignty and practicing
environmental management. Interpreting and implementing the
jurisdictions drawn up in unclos have been an experiment in ofshore
governance through conflicting performances of territory and sovereignty
in the ocean. Grappling with the ocean's material- ity and dynamism, as
a chaotic and flowing field, enacting the territorial logic]{.underline}
of baselines has created social and political divisions in New Zealand
leading to the ongoing controversies surrounding the division of ofshore
space and man- agement. Focusing [on]{.underline} disputed uses of
ofshore spaces necessarily confronts the 3. KAURI AND THE WHALE Oceanic
Matter and Meaning in New Zealand Katherine G. Sammler 64 ∙ Katherine G.
Sammler inherent ambiguity of the social and political process of
partitioning watery space (Baldacchino 2010). The geophysical,
hydrological, and biological ma- teriality and mobility of oceans
partially influence the logic of unclos and national enactments of the
international treaty, even as attempts are made to legislate around
these intrinsic ocean features. Regulators must contend with the agency
of the [living and nonliving natures]{.underline} as they enact static
borders among mobile bodies. Ships on the surface, whales, and human
bodies, whether on deck or partially submerged, engender relational
social and legal meanings, which have been enrolled in multiple and
conflicting territorializations of the ocean. [Categorical distinctions
between landscapes and seascapes, static and mobile structures and
bodies, human and nonhuman actors, have resulted in]{.underline} a
complex matrix of ofshore rights and responsibilities (Sammler 2016).
Enacting these [ontological]{.underline} and ethical
[divisions]{.underline} counters the unclos declaration, which states in
its preamble that "the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated
and need to be considered as a whole." This contradiction, and its
subsequent partitioning efects, is particularly significant in Aotearoa
New Zealand, where "unlike western models of property, Māori
relationship to the land is ontological, so that one's sovereignty is
formed out of a genealogical relationship to the land, sea, and to
nonhuman species" (DeLoughrey 2015, 356). This chapter follows calls to
attend to multiple geopolitical, biopoliti- cal, and ontological
dimensions toward a rigorous oceanic studies (Blum 2010; Helmreich 2009;
Lehman 2013; Steinberg and Peters 2015), applying an
onto-epistemological framework to incorporate how discursive practices
are causally related to material phenomena. In doing so, it makes
explicit how the practices of knowing and being are entangled, to
include an "understanding of the roles of human and nonhuman, material
and discursive, and natural and cultural factors in scientific and other
social-material practices" (Barad 2007, 26; emphasis in original). This
chapter thinks beyond how [ocean life and non- life are]{.underline}
imagined toward how they are practically [enrolled]{.underline} in
various ways [to enact borders, perform territories, produce political
spaces, and make claims of sovereignty]{.underline} (see also Povinelli
2016). This includes careful examination of the shifting legal arguments
made to justify emergent ocean uses, as well as how the material
engagement of the ocean can be used to resist extractive industry,
allowing alternative legalities to emerge. The following discussion
begins by investigating the complexities and con- troversies that emerge
from the oceans of New Zealand, beginning with the kinship of the kauri
and the whale, emphasizing the ontological diferences between Western
categorizations and Māori cosmologies. The implementation of land and
sea divisions via baselines has led to political unrest in Aotearoa
Oceanic Matter and Meaning in New Zealand ∙ 65 New Zealand and the rise
of an independent Māori parliamentary party. Strug- gles over ofshore
Indigenous property rights have been taking place among proposed
development of seabed mineral projects. This chapter considers base-
lines as a political technology (Elden 2010). This means reading the
baseline as a calculative apparatus that enacts cuts to refashion lively
ocean worlds into divisible spaces and objects in direct opposition to
Māori tribal holdings that span mountains to sea. Legislation
nationalizing the foreshore and seabed, along with projects seeking to
mine ofshore, have created rifts in New Zea- land society at the center
of ongoing protests. Some protestors have taken their actions ofshore.
These protestors are meeting with challenges to their right to protest
on and in the sea. While the freedom of navigation is enshrined in the
unclos treaty, particular ships---nuclear vessels, whaling boats, and
activ- ist flotillas---have encountered restrictions, demonstrating the
difficulties and ambiguities of emergent ofshore governance. Looking to
specific moments, as the New Zealand government continues to produce
legislation to (re)shape an ocean governance apparatus, this chapter
will demonstrate how these events ground politics within material and
lived oceans. This research partially draws on four months spent in New
Zealand in the austral winter of 2014, hosted by the University of
Auckland. The in-country data collection included roughly thirty
interviews with government employees from such institutions as the New
Zealand Environmental Protection Author- ity, New Zealand Petroleum and
Minerals, and the Ministry of Māori Devel- opment, as well as leading
national scientists and academics; participation in conferences,
workshops, and debates; and visits to archives, museums, black- sand
beaches, fern forests, and kauri stands. Kauri Rāua Ko Parāoa (Kauri and

August 17, 2014 [While dominant understandings of a land-sea binary were
codified by interna- tional law, Māori cosmologies and mythologies do
not share this Western ontology]{.underline} nor necessarily divide
natures---materially, practically, or politically---as demonstrated by
tribal governance of areas that regard customary rights from mountains
to sea. As Garth Harmsworth and Shaun Awatere explain, a fun- damental
tenet of Māori belief, whakapapa, engenders "connection, lineage, or
genealogy between humans and ecosystems and all flora and fauna" (2013,
275). [This includes a relationship with environments as a whole, a
network of connections, as defined by ki uta ki tai, "a
whole-of-landscape approach, un- derstanding and managing interconnected
resources and ecosystems from the mountains to the sea" (Harmworth and
Awatere 2013, 275). Whakapapa situates both human and more-than-human
bodies]{.underline} and materials [within a smooth framework of
kinship,]{.underline} entanglement, correspondence, exchange, [and
dispersed agency.]{.underline} One account, central to Northern Māori
mythology, ofers some insight into the smooth exchange of materials,
bodies, and narratives between the hydro and geo spheres by the shared
origin account of kauri and whale. Indigenous to New Zealand, kauri
(Agathis australis) are towering trees reaching upward to fifty meters
(see figures 3.1 and 3.2). Northern Māori oral traditions present kauri
to be the father of the sperm whale. Due to their in- credible size,
both are esteemed as rangatira (chiefs). Beyond their immensity, they
are comparable in their smooth, yet textured, greyish-brown exterior,
both bark and skin enclosing valuable oils, where, "kauri gum is like
the ambergris found in the intestines of the sperm whale" (Tāmaki Paenga
Hira \[Auckland War Memorial Museum\], visited August 17, 2014). Due to
its combustibility, Māori long used kauri resin for cooking and
lighting, similar to how spermaceti, the oil of the sperm whale
(Physeter macrocephalus), was used in early Western industrial nations.
[Colonizing Europeans]{.underline} harvested and [sold kauri
timber]{.underline}, known for its resistance to seawater and sturdy,
straight-grained lumber for masts and spars. Used for various wares
domestically and abroad, [this tree, like the whale, was exploited to
near collapse]{.underline} in the nineteenth century. Other Māori
narratives also bridge land and sea, employing human and more-than-human
entities that openly exceed or exchange categories. The two main islands
that constitute Aotearoa New Zealand are not presumed to be static land

broader Pacific context when he writes, "Continental men, namely
Europeans . . . introduced the view of 'islands in a far sea' . . .
tiny, isolated dots in a vast ocean. . . . Our ancestors, who had lived
in the Pacific for over two thousand years, viewed their world as 'a sea
of islands' rather than as 'islands in the sea' " (1994, 153; see also
DeLoughrey 2015). This continental gaze forms the dominant hegemonic
view of oceans as seen from land, [drawing lines of division between
land and sea]{.underline}, between kauri and whale. Categorical binary
divisions [as an apparatus of settler colonial governance of
diference]{.underline} and markets are defined by Elizabeth Povinelli
(2016) as geontology. Povinelli's understanding of geontopower [ensures
the enclosure of life]{.underline} (bios) [from nonlife]{.underline}
(geos, meteoros) as a "way of sorting the world \[that\] makes sense
only from the disciplinary logic of geology, a disciplinary perspective
that re- lies on natural types and species logics" (Povinelli 2016, 11).
Applied to ocean spaces and resources, [divisions are employed
to]{.underline} categorically enclose land (geos) from sea (hydros),
human (anthropos) from animal (zoe), and surface seas (pelago) from deep
ocean (abbyso) and seafloor (bathy). As Māori traditions instead draw
lines of connection, instituting cuts between land/sea, human/ nonhuman,
creating discrete, bounded entities, goes against Māori whakapapa. The
legislative [implement]{.underline}ation of these cuts in the form of
baselines and of- shore [resource appropriation]{.underline} by the New
Zealand national government led to widespread protest. Resulting
political actions demonstrate the divergent on- tologies, worlds at
odds, "the world in which the dependent oppositions . . . are sensible
and dramatic and the world in which these enclosures are no longer, or
have never been, relevant, sensible, or practical" (Povinelli 2016, 16).
Developing Divisions In a contemporary context, borders of nation-states
and the spatial category of sovereign territory are often imagined as
predominantly fixed. Politically con- structed boundaries can be
concealed as wholly technical, or even scientific, afairs, as if a
coastline were an essential and stable object. Yet current events are
reminders of how national boundaries are produced and in flux,
demonstrated by the dredging up of islands in the South China Sea for
their associated liquid territories and the shifting of sands across the
Singapore Strait, as discussed in Jennifer L. Gaynor's chapter in this
volume, or the disappearing territory, par- ticularly of Pacific Island
nations, due to sea-level rise. Intrinsic to defining ocean boundaries
are baselines, the technical division between land and sea. Defined as
"the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts
officially recognized by the coastal State" (unclos, Arti- Oceanic
Matter and Meaning in New Zealand ∙ 69 cle 5), the baseline is a
mechanism by which dynamic and shifting coastlines are transmogrified
into static political borders. Baselines are geopolitically signifi-
cant because not only do they provide the foundation for measuring
maritime jurisdictions, but they also delimit the outermost extent of a
nation's territorial land (Bateman and Schofield 2008). They are
therefore a significant part of the discursive means by which the
totality of the ocean is disassembled from an interrelated whole and
reconfigured as disparate parts. Following Stuart Elden's (2010) notion
of territory as a political technol- ogy, made up by techniques to
calculate, evaluate, and control both land and sea, the highly technical
knowledge employed to delineate ofshore territories can be examined
alongside the political negotiations involved in making claims on these
spaces. Baselines are one apparatus within the political technology for
ocean territorialization, an act of measurement that "enacts [agential
cuts that produce determinate boundaries and properties of
'entitie]{.underline}s' " (Barad 2007, 148). While represented as
natural, approximations of the coastline, baselines create meaning
through social-material practices of boundary making; they enact cuts
that fashion land and sea spaces into discrete entities. They are the
foundational technical and political apparatus used by unclos to
partition the ocean. To consider the political technologies used to
bound ofshore ter- ritories, the materiality and mobility of ocean
spaces and beings must be ad- dressed. Yet, the national government in
New Zealand has struggled to leg- islate around these issues, and, in
response, the partitioning of land and sea through the implementation of
baselines and nationalization of the seabed has provoked passionate
demonstrations. Controversies persist as seabed mining projects seek to
commodify ocean minerals.

\*paragraph integrity not preserved\*

[With the horrific disasters our planet and this country have been
confronted with this year, it is almost easy to forget that the world is
supposed to be ending sometime soon due to climate change]{.underline}.
According to the UN, we have 10 years to get our act together. 9 years.
8 years. 7 years. 6... How many years are even left? A few years for us
to change everything about our society. Faced with a pandemic that has
only helped to make time feel truly meaningless, I know I can't be the
only person fearful that they have lost count. I can already feel the
time left for us to right the ship escaping me, like sand falling
between my fingers. I know that for many, when they think of the
responsibility we have before us to "fix" what is so deeply broken, they
are transfixed with terror, paralyzed by a fear of loss, or frozen by
the enormity of the crisis. I am not here to tell you that it will be
ok. If it was ever my job to console you, it certainly is especially not
my job in this moment, as a Black man surviving 2020. I am actually here
to confirm that the apocalypse is coming. The world is ending. Nothing
will ever be the same. But I am also here to question whether that is
even a bad thing. If it is a bad thing, then who is this ending a bad
thing for? [**Whose world is ending? ** so many people in our society
have already faced their own personal apocalypse Truly, on this planet,
there are many people for whom the world is already over.]{.underline}
Who have very little to lose. Some of them live a world away; some of
them live a mile away; some of them live even closer. They will never
see the nature that so many environmentalists are fighting to protect,
they continue to have very little if any access to the resources that
the climate change advocates are asking them to conserve, and they are
not a respected part of the climate change conversation. Our [society
fears a coming climate apocalypse, but so many people in our society
have already faced their own personal apocalypse, and at the hands of
the same reckless and greedy powers which have caused this current
catastrophe. **When will their suffering hold meaning for the rest of
us? do we even deserve this precious planet?**]{.underline} This is why
climate change cannot be fixed with a simple chart depicting emissions
reductions, creative blockchain carbon taxation, or other magical
accounting that allows us to cancel out local emissions through trees
planted (allegedly) entire continents away. There is no technology that
can save us from ourselves, and if we can't see the incredible
opportunity before us to change the problems that lead us to this very
precipice in the first place, if we can't embrace that challenge then...
who are we? If we don't want to face that reality of the billions of
apocalypses both gone and current, and instead choose half measures that
will take carbon from the air but leave the world a shattered and
unequal place... then do we even deserve this precious planet? [the
world has already ended several times For many fearing climate change
apocalypse, they fear their lives changing forever, their access to
natural wonders canceled, their children's economic futures uncertain,
their sacrifices of comfort and convenience in vain due to petty
partisan politics. It is their world that is ending. For so many others,
the apocalypse has already happened. In fact, the world has already
ended several times. **It ended the moment Columbus landed on the
islands of the Caribbean. It ended for the kidnapped villagers in
Western Africa---my ancestors**--- when they were stuffed into the
wicked belly of a slave ship **and cast into slavery in a strange land
with a strange new climate**. It ended with the first blanket covered in
smallpox. It ended on Thanksgiving Day. It ended with the Trail of
Tears. Agent Orange. Hiroshima. The Holocaust. It ended with Hurricane
Katrina, Maria, Kenneth, Harvey and Dorian. **It ended for George Floyd
and Breonna Taylor.** It ended in an ICE camp on the border. It ended
for the 2 million, and counting, killed by COVID-19.  So many people
have already faced the ends of their own civilization. So many people
have already faced the ending of their personal worlds. Most of these
shattered worlds never truly recovered. None of them have ever
been]{.underline} given what they, [as sacrifice zones sanctioned to
enable the perpetual motion of our economy, are owed. They have never
even had a real slice of this world, to begin with. This was not their
world.]{.underline} These people and their ancestors know better than
any of us how to tackle what's coming, and what forces have allowed it
to come, even as they face the new onslaught of climate change impacts
which they have so little responsibility for causing.  this looming
chaos is nothing more than the culmination of those generations of
recklessness Our global civilization, the one that everyone reading this
article is benefitting from, was built on the literal ashes of other
civilizations. Meanwhile, a few white men from a few white nations have
made nearly all of the decisions that have led us to this present point.
To this present danger. Ending any inconvenient worlds that fell into
their path along the way. Justifying their revolting actions with caste
and class. In many ways, this looming chaos is nothing more than the
culmination of those generations of recklessness. In many other ways,
the terror of oncoming apocalypse only reminds those with broken worlds
of how forgotten they are and have always been. My family, and my
colleagues in the BIPOC-led climate justice movement, have grown up out
of these shattered post-apocalyptic worlds, they are our story, our
burden, and our strength, and to be frank, **[the world that so many
fear losing... is not a world that we have ever had full access
to.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- Russia

**The affs framing of US-Russia war is an attempt to secure whiteness
against its own inevitable decline.**

**Bifo 22** \[Franco Berardi, aka "Bifo," founder of Radio Alice, member

**[At the Eastern borders of Europe, two old white men play a game in
which neither of them can retreat.]{.underline}**

The old white American is on the heels of a humiliating and tragic
defeat. Worse than Saigon, Kabul is fresh in the global imaginary as a
sign of the cognitive breakdown of the long-dominant, imperialist power.

The old white Russian knows that the base of his power is a nationalist
promise: to avenge the honor of "Holy Mother Russia."

The one who retreats first will lose everything.

The fact that Putin is a Nazi was already clear at the conclusion of the
second war in Chechnya. But at the time, he was still lauded by the
American president, who looked him in the eyes and praised his
sincerity. The Russian also enjoyed the favor of British banks, as they
were filled to the brim with rubles robbed by Putin and his friends
through the dismantling of public infrastructures after the fall of the
Soviet Union. Geriatric Russians and Anglo-Americans were brothers in
arms when it came to destroying the social spheres produced by past
labor and communist movements all over the world.

[But friendship and camaraderie don't last among assassins. In fact,
what use would NATO be if peace was actually brokered? And how would a
successful peace have affected the bottom lines of the multinational
companies producing weapons of mass destruction and death---today making
endless profits.]{.underline}

[The expansion of NATO only serves to reignite a hostility that
capitalism could not let die, to **keep the profitable conflict
alive.**]{.underline}

There is no rational explanation for the war in Ukraine, especially
because it is the climactic movement in a psychotic crisis of the white
brain. [What rationality is there in the expansion of NATO, which arms
Polish, Baltic, and, yes, Ukrainian Nazis against Russian Nazism? In
exchange, Biden gets the result most feared by American war strategists:
forcing Russia and China into an embrace that fifty years ago Nixon had
succeeded in weakening.]{.underline}

Given that the war is inexplicable in strategic terms, [to understand
the war we don't need to think geopolitically, but rather
psycho-pathologically. Perhaps we need a geopolitics of psychotic
outbursts.]{.underline}

[At stake here is the political, economic, demographic, and finally
psychic defeat of white, Western, (post)colonial civilization, which
cannot accept the prospect of exhaustion, which prefers destruction or
suicide to the slow extinction of white dominance.]{.underline}

West, Future, Decline

With the war in Ukraine, a hysterical arms race begins, [borders are
consolidated (along racialized lines]{.underline}), and violence
increases exponentially---all demonstrations of the senile marasmus into
which the West has fallen.

On February 23, 2022, when Russian troops were already in the Donbass,
Trump praised Putin as a peacekeeping "genius," and suggested that the
US follow his lead on the Mexican border.

Let's see if we can figure out what Trump's obscenities mean. Is there a
kernel of truth in his delusions? At issue is the very concept of the
West.

But first, what is the West?

If by "West" we refer to a geographical definition, then Russia is of
course excluded. But if we think about the anthropological and
historical meanings of that word, then Russia is more Western than any
other West.

In short, [the West can be defined as the land of decline and of
obsession with the future]{.underline}. Those two traits are in fact
one, given that for organisms subject to the second law of
thermodynamics---as are individual and social bodies---[the future can
only mean eventual decline.]{.underline}

We---both the "we" of [the West and the Westerners of the boundless
Russian lands---are therefore united in futurism and decline, that is,
in the delirium of omnipotence and in the desperation of
impotence.]{.underline}

Trump gets credit for telling it like it is, claiming that our enemies
are not Russians, but migrants from the Global South; China, which we
have humiliated; Africa, which we have plundered. Those are our enemies,
not the very white Russia, which is part of the "Great West."

[This Trumpist logic is based on a white supremacy that sees Russianness
as the most extreme form of acceptable whiteness.]{.underline}

[Biden's logic is instead based on the defense of the "free world": a
world born from genocide, from the forced deportation of millions of
slaves, and organized around foundational systemic racism.]{.underline}
Biden chooses to break the "Great West" apart in favor of a smaller West
without Russia, which is in any case destined to tear itself apart and
to involve the whole planet in its suicide.

So, let's [define the West as a sphere of racist dominance obsessed with
the future]{.underline}. Time stretches out in an expansive pulse:
economic growth, accumulation, capitalism. It is exactly this obsession
with the future that feeds the machine of dominance: a concrete present
(of pleasure, of muscular relaxation) is invested into and exchanged for
abstract future value.

Perhaps we could reformulate the classical Marxist analysis of value to
say that exchange value is precisely this accumulation of the present
(the concrete) in abstract forms (like money) that can be exchanged for
something else tomorrow.

The fixation on and fetishization of the future are by no means a
natural cognitive modality of the human. Most human cultures have been
organized around a cyclical understanding of time, or on the insuperable
dilation of the present.

Futurism is a transition to complete self-consciousness (also in
aesthetic terms) of cultures of expansion. But there are many futurisms.

The obsession with the future has different implications in the
theological-utopian sphere that is central to Russian culture and the
techno-economic sphere of Euro-American culture. Federov's cosmism and
Mayakovsky's futurisms both share an eschatological breath that is
lacked by the technocratic fanaticisms of Marinetti and Musk. Maybe
that's why it is Russia's destiny to end history---and here we are.

Nazism Is Everywhere

[The new horizon is war that pits one Nazism against
another]{.underline}. In his writings from the 1960s, Gunter Anders
predicted that the nihilistic charge of Nazism would not die with the
defeat of Hitler. He presaged that it would return onto the world stage
when technical power developed to such a degree that it provoked the
humiliation of the human.

[Nazism is reemerging as a psycho-political form of the demented body of
the white race, which ragefully reacts to its own unstoppable decline.
Viral chaos has created the conditions for the formation of a global,
biopolitical infrastructure, but it has also accentuated the widely
experienced perception of matter's ungovernability as it loses order,
disintegrates, and dies.]{.underline}

[The West has forsaken death because that concept is not compatible with
its obsession with the future]{.underline}. It has rejected senility
because it is not compatible with expansion and growth. But now, the
(demographic, cultural, and economic) aging of the dominant cultures of
the Global North are presented as a specter that white culture cannot
even contemplate, let alone accept.

This is where the white brain (that of both Biden and Putin) enters a
furious crisis of senile dementia. Then the white brain most lost to
senility---that of Donald Trump---utters a truth that no one can stand
to hear: Putin is our best friend. Sure, he's a racist murderer, but we
are no less so.

On the other hand, Biden represents the impotent anger that old people
express and feel when they notice the decline of their strength, psychic
energy, and cognitive efficiency. Now that exhaustion is in its advanced
stage, extinction is the only reassuring prospect.

### 1NC -- China

#### The affs desire to "curtail" Chinese territorialization of the blue elides the ways in which the clash between the dominant western order and that of the emerging power that is China are indicative of and reify colonial blue desires.

[In July 2016, an international tribunal constituted under the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) handed down its ruling
in an arbitration requested by the Philippines over China's actions in
the South China Sea.]{.underline} Alongside a meticulous catalogue of
Beijing's breaches of the Convention, the ruling's key significance was
to set stringent criteria for establishing a maritime land feature's
legal status as an "island" entitled to expansive jurisdictional rights
over the surrounding waters. [On the surface, the legal landmark sharply
circumscribed the potential scope of sovereign claims over maritime
space. But it also highlighted the paradoxical territorialization of
maritime space under the "global constitution for the world's oceans."
Throughout the twentieth century, while international law gradually was
chipping away at state authority over the earth's landmasses, precisely
the opposite was occurring at sea.]{.underline} In Bernard Oxman's
memorable terms, the "territorial temptation" of the world's
nation-states "thrust seaward with a speed and geographic scope that
would be the envy of the most ambitious conquerors in human
history.\"Bernard Oxman, "The Territorial Temptation: A Siren Song at
Sea," American Journal of International Law, vol. 100, no. 4 (2006), p.
832. [The displacement of the doctrine of *mare liberum*, defended in
recent centuries by successive maritime hegemons, began with United
States President Harry Truman's assertion of sovereign rights on its
"continental shelf"]{.underline} in 1945. Far from objecting to this
unprecedented, unilateral expansion of state jurisdiction at sea, [other
major maritime powers quickly emulated it.]{.underline} Behind this
sudden, breezy betrayal of the long-treasured "free seas" lay the
prospect of hydrocarbon exploitation made possible by new offshore
drilling and extraction techniques. In the first Law of the Sea
Convention signed in 1958 the state parties agreed -- absurdly in
hindsight -- to grant each other exclusive rights to the seabed out to
whatever distance "admits of the exploitation of the natural
resources."United Nations, "Convention on the Continental Shelf, 1958,"
(http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf).
Under this formulation, the extent of sovereign claims to seabed
resources was limited only by the rapidly developing oil and gas
extraction technology. [The UNCLOS concluded in 1982 at Montego Bay,
Jamaica, is the defining expression of the territorialization of
maritime space. Although the 107 state governments sensibly agreed to
limit the previously infinite continental shelf claims to 650
kilometers, they also assigned themselves and each other sovereign
authority not just over the seabed, but also the resources of the water
*column* out to 370 kilometers from the homeland's nearest basepoint,
including islands. In so doing, they subjected nearly 50 per cent of the
world's oceans to land-based claims of state jurisdiction.]{.underline}
Other governments were understandably eager to join the regime, and
today 157 nation-states are parties to the UNCLOS. This carve-up of half
the planet's oceans was not simply a naked grab for power and oil; other
goals of the process included allotting responsibilities for
environmental protection and avoiding "tragedies of the commons" through
orderly, regulated exploitation. This may have been the tradeoff that
induced civil societies to agree to such an enormous expansion in state
authority.Oxman, "Territorial Temptation," pp. 844‒45. However, beyond
the prospect of international legal opprobrium of the kind suffered by
China following the 2016 arbitration, states' *responsibilities* under
the Convention lack an effective means of enforcement. The new sovereign
maritime *rights*, by contrast, faced no such issues, for every state
party stood ready to enforce those. Indeed, as Oxman notes, they were
quickly understood in "quasi-territorial terms."Oxman, "Territorial
temptation," pp. 839‒40. This was nowhere more so than [in China, where
areas subject to its resource rights claims came to be regarded as "blue
territory." CHINA'S "BLUE TERRITORY"]{.underline} CONCEPT. The People's
Republic of China (PRC) -- presumptive successor to a dozen great
continental empires -- took some time to recognize the new opportunities
and challenges presented by the carve-up of the world's oceans. By 1996,
[however, when it ratified the Convention after a fourteen-year delay,
PRC maritime agencies had become acutely aware of the "gradual
territorialization" (逐步国土化) of vast expanses of ocean that was by
now in full swing]{.underline}.See Chapter 1 of China's Maritime Agenda
for the 21st Century, a programmatic document released immediately prior
to its ratification of the Convention. Zhongguo Haiyang 21 Shiji Yicheng
(China's Maritime Agenda for the 21st Century). Beijing: State Oceanic
Administration (SOA), March 1996
(http://sdinfo.coi.gov.cn/hyfg/hyfgdb/fg8.htm) (accessed December 1,
2016). The PRC appears to have viewed the territorialization process in
generally positive terms at that time. Indeed, so sanguine were the
Agenda's authors that they even described UNCLOS as "beneficial to
breaking maritime hegemonism" -- a glowing accolade within the Chinese
Communist Party's (CCP) Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideological system. See
China's Maritime Agenda, Chapter 10. [China's ratification of the regime
in May 1996 set in motion a succession of technical and policy responses
that have imposed legal, organizational, and physical layers of
land-based rule over the disputed South and East China
Seas.]{.underline} The chain of Chinese policy reactions began with the
enactment of a variety of new legal instruments -- notably the 1998 *Law
of the People\'s Republic of China on the Exclusive Economic Zone*
\[EEZ\] and the Continental Shelf -- that gave unprecedentedly specific,
concrete form to China's claimed sovereign rights at sea. As Isaac
Kardon notes, this burgeoning body of maritime laws, regulations, and
ordinances was crucial in "processing the various new rights and
interests created by China\'s accession to UNCLOS."See Isaac Kardon,
"China's Maritime Rights and Interests: Organizing to become a Maritime
Power," paper presented at the China as a Maritime Power Conference,
Center for Naval Analyses, Washington, DC, July 28‒29, 2015
(https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/china-maritime-rights.pdf). By the
turn of the century, these sweeping, once-amorphous claims were rapidly
hardening into a concept of "blue territory." As the Minister of Land
and Resources Zhou Yongkang stated in a 1999 speech: \[...\] according
to UNCLOS and our country's claims, we possess around 3 million square
kilometres of waters under administration. Of course, there is a
significant area that is in dispute, which is to say, there is a long
way to go and much difficult work to be done to genuinely roll out our
maritime undertakings over 3 million square kilometres of blue
territory.Zhou Yongkang's speech is printed in the State Oceanic
Administration's (SOA), Zhongguo Haiyang Nianjian (China Ocean Yearbook)

China's claims to islands in the South China Sea had been manifest in
the now-infamous nine-dash line map since the 1940s. But the map, titled
Location Map of Various Islands in the South China Sea (南海诸岛位置图),
contained no hint of any claims to particular maritime spaces -- let
alone the entire area enclosed by the line. The UNCLOS offers no support
for such an expansive reading of the line; indeed the arbitral tribunal
emphasized just the opposite. Yet, ironically, [the increasingly
territorialized quality of China's maritime claims -- and its approach
to prosecuting them -- is very much a product of the UNCLOS era. The
UNCLOS-inspired reification of China's maritime claims into domestic
legal instruments prompted the creation of new law enforcement
organizations. This in turn produced new technologies of enforcement
that have redefined the rules of disputes at sea, at least in maritime
Asia.]{.underline} The China Marine Surveillance (CMS) force,
established in 1999, was given the task of rolling out "comprehensive
administration" in all areas subject to PRC jurisdictional claims. Major
allocations of central funds in 2000 equipped the new agency with a
fleet of large long-range, high-endurance -- but largely unarmed --
oceangoing patrol boats and aircraft. The first "dashed-line" map:
Location Map of Various Islands in the South China Sea, published by the
Republic of China in 1947. These systems for achieving a constant patrol
presence, greater maritime domain awareness, and the necessary personnel
and logistical support, took several years to develop. But by 2006 the
agency was ready to launch its "regular maritime rights defense patrols"
across disputed areas.Initially the system was introduced in the East
China Sea in June 2006. Once its feasibility had been proven there, the
CMS extended the scope to cover the Yellow Sea and the northern part of
the South China Sea from February 2007. Nine months later, this was
expanded again to include the southern part of the South China Sea.
Thus, by December 2007, the regular patrol system theoretically covered
all of "the 3 million square kilometres of waters under China's
administration." See Qian Xiuli, "Woguo jianli quan haiyu weiquan
xunhang zhidu, 300 wan pingfang gongli guanxia haiyu naru dingqi weiquan
xunhang zhidu guanli fanwei (China establishes rights defense patrol

advanced, white-hulled fleets have become central to the competition
over maritime space in Asia, with China's rivals rushing to upgrade
their own coastguards, on-water law enforcement authorities, and
maritime surveillance systems. These mobile outgrowths of the
technosphere are redefining the terms of [competition over the seas --
away from access, and towards occupation and control. In this way,
twenty-first-century maritime disputes have increasingly come to
resemble terrestrial disputes over (sparsely populated) land areas.

Offshore Oil Company CEO Wang Yilin as "mobile national territory."
Xinhua 2010. Technology has also reconfigured the role of paramilitary
law enforcement at sea. Far from maritime safety and fighting crime
against specific targets like smugglers, maritime law enforcement is now
increasingly geared towards the performance of sovereignty. The
potential implications of China's "Great White Fleet" in advancing its
unilateral administration of disputed maritime spaces started to become
clear to outside observers by the start of the 2010s.Ryan Martinson,

The white-hulled strategy appears to have come to the attention of the
US government in around 2010, judging by its debut appearance in the

Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China.

[But their effect is even more profound when viewed from Beijing, where
key policymakers operate -- rightly or wrongly -- on an assumption that
principles of prescriptive acquisition apply to the sea,]{.underline} as
they traditionally have done on land.On prescription in territorial
acquisition, see Surya Prakesh Sharma, Territorial Acquisition, Disputes
and International Law. The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 1997, pp.

Court of Justice," Duke Law Journal, vol. 53 (April 2004), pp. 1787‒88.
As China rolled out its regularized patrol system using the CMS force in
2008, its party boss Sun Shuxian asserted that there are just two
principles regarding the existence of state authority in disputed
waters: one is "effective administration" (有效管理), the other "actual
control" (实际控制). Without these, Sun said, there was little point in
claiming that the area was in question.Yu Wei, "Zhongguo Haijian youwang

activities of all civil technologies -- not only patrol boats, but also
fishing trawlers, oil rigs, and even cellphone signals and weather
reports -- are not merely asserting the state's presence, advancing the
national economy, addressing its energy security, or carrying its
communications. Rather, they are seen as performatively creating state
sovereignty at sea.SOA, ZGHYNJ 2010, p. 127. The CMS East Sea Branch's
entry to the 2006 yearbook refers to a centrally approved guideline
(中央批准的方针) of "display jurisdiction and embody China's sovereign
rights" in contested waters. SOA, ZGHYNJ 2006, p. 164. The previous
year's entry states, "The principles of 'highlight presence, ensure
safety, manifest our sovereign rights and administration of these
waters' were effectively implemented, and powerfully supported and
complemented our government\'s diplomatic actions." SOA, ZGHYNJ 2005, p.
193. MANUFACTURING LAND, LEVERAGING THE HEAVENS. [It is hard to imagine
a more vivid illustration of the technosphere's role in altering the
boundaries between land and sea than China's construction of artificial
islands in the Spratly archipelago.]{.underline} Over the course of
approximately eighteen months, using dozens of industrial dredgers and
coral-cutting machines, the PLA turned seven tiny reef outposts into
bases larger than any of the natural landmasses in the area. In all,
according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), they
managed to transform nearly 1,300 hectares of the world's most contested
maritime space into new territories that now host small cities, with
three airfields, dozens of buildings, roads, parks, leisure facilities
and, based on recent satellite photography, silos ready to take
surface-to-air missile deployments."A look at China's SAM shelters in
the Spratlys," Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, February 23, 2017
(https://amti.csis.org/chinas-sam-shelters-spratlys[/). China was not
the first country to reclaim land in the Spratlys. But the speed and
scale of the sea-to-land conversion was unprecedented.Over the years,
Vietnam is believed to have expanded its Spratly outposts by just under
50 hectares, Malaysia around 30 hectares, and the Philippines and Taiwan
around 4‒6 hectares each. This, in turn, was a direct function of
China's economic, industrial, logistical and, above all, technological
capabilities.See Andrew Erickson and Kevin Bond, "Dredging Under the
Radar: China Expands South Sea Foothold," The National Interest, August
26, 2015
(http://nationalinterest.org/feature/dredging-under-the-radar-china-expands-south-sea-foothold-13701?page=show).China's
desire to "fill in the sea to manufacture land" (填海造地) on this
industrial scale reflects its latecomer status in the Spratly Islands.
The Spratlys are by far the largest of the South China Sea's disputed
archipelagos. Unlike the claims to *maritime spaces* discussed above,
which are largely the product of the UNCLOS era, China's claims to these
*island territories* were inherited from the PRC's vanquished civil war
rival, the Republic of China, which fled to Taiwan in 1949. When a
scramble to occupy the islands began in the late 1960s, Mao's China was
preoccupied with the Cultural Revolution, Soviet threats to the northern
land border, and rapprochement with America. As a result, the few ships
the PLA possessed remained thousands of kilometers away while the
Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia staked out all of the dozen or so
genuine islands in the Spratly group]{.underline}. By the time the PLA
Navy finally made its move on the Spratlys in late 1987, all the prime
real estate was occupied, and it took a fierce naval skirmish with
Vietnam just to establish a tenuous foothold on six submerged reefs.
Through the 1990s and 2000s, China consolidated its outposts from
rickety huts on stilts, to slightly more solid-looking pillboxes, and
then to a third generation of "reef forts," before the island
construction began in 2013. These shallow patches of ocean -- to the
naked eye often virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding azure
(as many shipwrecked navigators discovered) -- concealed complex and
spectacular underwater coral ecologies. Marine biologists believe the
land-based military and civilian presence of all sides -- particularly
horizontal expansions of the technosphere like infrastructure
development -- has been adversely impacting the surrounding marine
ecology beneath the waves for some time.Terry Hughes, Hui Huang, and
Matthew Young, "The Wicked Problem of China's Disappearing Coral Reefs,"

In the Spratlys, Vietnam and China operate rival cellphone networks;
China's reportedly sends automatic "Welcome to China!" text messages to
every handset that comes within range.Lawrence and Fan, "Islands of Mass
Destruction." Once again, as with the 1958 continental shelf agreement,
sovereign claims extend precisely as far as the technosphere will carry
them. But the single most consequential example of the technosphere's
role in territorializing Asia's maritime spaces occurred in the
Scarborough Shoal incident of April 2012. On the morning of April 10,
2012, the Philippines' naval ship BRP Gregorio del Pilar arrived at
Scarborough Shoal, an isolated atoll around 125 nautical miles off the
northern coast of Luzon, to investigate a group of Chinese fishing boats
spotted two days earlier by an aerial patrol. After the warship anchored
outside the entrance to the sprawling lagoon, it dispatched armed
soldiers on dinghies to investigate.Award in the Matter of the South

People's Republic of China, Permanent Court of Arbitration case no.
2013-19, July 12, 2016, 325 (http://www.pcacases.com/web/view/7). After
collecting photographic evidence of large quantities of endangered giant
clams and corals on board the Chinese fishing boats, the Philippine
soldiers returned to the ship, apparently with the intention of
detaining and processing the crews the following day. However, late in
the afternoon, two CMS patrol boats arrived and took up positions
between the Gregorio del Pilar and the fishing boats, physically
preventing their arrest.For a blow-by-blow account from fisherman Chen
Zebo (陳則波) see Zeng Ming, "Hainan yumin: qu Huangyan Dao yao zuolao
(Going to Huangyan Island means going to jail)," Nanfang Zhoumo
(Southern Weekend), May 4, 2012
(http://news.qq.com/a/20120504/000428.htm). Thus began a two-month
standoff at sea that ended when the Philippines withdrew its ships ahead
of a typhoon, leaving China in control of the disputed atoll.By August,
Manila had issued twelve formal diplomatic protests over the incident.
Ryan Chua, "Philippines to bring China dispute to world body," ABS-CBN
News, August 3, 2012
(http://news.abs-cbn.com/-depth/08/03/12/philippines-bring-china-dispute-world-body).
Thereafter, Manila refrained from sending its ships back to Scarborough
Shoal, while their Chinese counterparts maintained a constant presence.
China emerged with effective control over the shoal.In late 2016,
following new Philippines President Duterte's strong pro-Beijing
overtures, the PRC began tolerating Filipino fishing activities at the
shoal. But it did not withdraw its ships from the shoal, making clear
that Philippine fishing took place at Beijing's pleasure. "Pinoy
fishermen say they can fish in Scarborough Shoal again," ABS-CBN News,
October 28, 2016
(http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/10/27/16/pinoy-fishermen-say-they-can-fish-in-scarborough-shoal-again).
The Scarborough Shoal incident was a smokeless battle for
territorial-style control of maritime space, fought across the
technosphere's horizontal and vertical dimensions. The trigger for the
confrontation was the Philippine military's decision to dispatch its
largest naval vessel to investigate the Chinese fishing activities first
spotted by an airborne patrol on April 8. This response, in turn, was
made possible by the US's provision of the vessel, a refurbished
coastguard cutter, which had been commissioned into the Philippines Navy
in December 2011. The next key link in the causal chain was the
emergency distress call system that had recently been installed on the
PRC fishing boats. This enabled the crews to instantaneously alert
authorities in Hainan of the situation using the Beidou satellite
navigation system, which with near-perfect synchronicity had entered
service the same month as Manila's flagship whose mission it would
thwart.Geoff Wade, "Beidou: China's new satellite navigation system,"

(http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2015/February/Beidou_China_new_satellite_navigation_system).
Finally, the ability of the two CMS ships to reach the area in time to
prevent the arrests was a direct result of their being in the area on a
"regular rights defense patrol" at the time -- a program enabled by
technologies whose genesis lay, as detailed above[, in the legal
instruments China crafted in response to the arrival of the UNCLOS
regime under which half the world's maritime littoral was
territorialized."]{.underline}Liu Cigui: Bohai yiyou haishang wuran

This dossier entry has detailed how the scope of land-based state
authority over East Asia's seas has been intimately related to the
horizontal outgrowth of the technosphere. The development of offshore
oil and gas was integral to the original seaward thrust of state
authority in 1945, and in 1958 international law left the extent of that
authority in the impersonal hands of technological development[. Yet,
this alignment between technosphere and land-based dominion over the sea
was by no means a new development. The historical ascendancy of the
"free seas" doctrine was dependent on sponsorship from a succession of
technologically advanced maritime hegemons.]{.underline} And even during
this period, exclusive state authority over the seas was widely accepted
out to a distance of 3 nautical miles from the coast -- a figure derived
from the putative range of a cannon shot. Nor is there anything novel
(or indeed technologically determined) about changes in the land‒sea
divide in Asia. Like the volcanic eruptions that in 2013 created the new
island of Nishinoshima (which Japan may use to expand its own EEZ
claim), or the storms that apparently created a new territory at Luconia
Shoals in the far southern reaches of the Spratly Islands, the edges of
land and sea are naturally always shifting.See Andrew Chubb, "Luconia
Breakers: China's new 'southernmost territory' in the South China Sea?"

(https://southseaconversations.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/luconia-breakers-chinas-new-southernmost-territory-in-the-south-china-sea/).
What is novel is the role of the outward, upward, seaward spread of
human tools in precipitating so many recent changes -- and the layers of
meaning that such changes accrue in the context of our categorical
knowledge schemes, of which the land‒sea dichotomy stands as one of the
most fundamentally inescapable.

[The Arctic region is home to 4 million people, including over one
million members of more than forty Indigenous groups]{.underline} (The
Arctic Council, 2015). Half of the population are reindeer herders, who
have their own cultures, languages, and lifeways (Bladow, 2019;
Kuokkanen, 2023). The Arctic [contains large territories with past and
present unequal global relations that are colonial]{.underline} in
character. Several Arctic regions have been turned into key resource
frontier sites for the extractive fossil fuel, metal mining, energy and
forestry economies supported by key global North states, such as Norway,
Sweden, the United States, Canada, Finland, Denmark, and the Russian
Federation (Bennett, 2016; Keil, 2014). These [Arctic extractivist
frontiers have been resisted by local peoples, often
Indigenous]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022; Nygren et al., 2022).
Resistance arises against fossil fuels, but **[there are also movements
opposing green or low-carbon energy projects]{.underline}** (Lassila,
2018; Össbo, 2023). The Arctic is especially affected by the cascading
impacts of the climate catastrophe, with its climate warming four times
faster in comparison to other regions (Herrmann, 2015; IPCC, 2019). The
climate crisis and its purported solutions currently play an increasing
role in shaping Arctic life. [Climate change is creating a discourse and
actions leading to the expansion of **green extractivism** across the
region. While risks are increasing, the Arctic is paradoxically
perceived by many domestic and transnational companies as a central
point for so-called new green energy solutions and mining of transition
minerals]{.underline} (Duxbury, 2021; Hanaček et al., 2022; Len, 2021).
For example, western Greenland, where coastal glaciers have been
melting, has been a target of new mining ventures seeking to offer
minerals for the electrification of energy (Gronholt-Pedersen, 2022).
[While the climate crisis has been caused mostly by colonial
actions]{.underline} and extractivist frontier expansion by the elites
and corporations of the core areas of the capitalist world-ecology
(Moore, 2016), the Arctic suffers excessively, and is furthermore [cast
as a **\"sacrifice zone**\" for extracting minerals and energy for
supposed climate change solutions]{.underline} (Össbo, 2023). The crisis
of the [capitalist world-ecology,]{.underline} meaning a rush to
dwindling natural resources, [is fueling a desire to expand extractivist
activities in the Arctic,]{.underline} creating a complex and [perilous
feedback loop]{.underline}, [as Arctic extractivism can directly drive
the breaching of global climate tipping points]{.underline} (Kröger,
2023). For example, flaring and increased atmospheric soot and dust from
mining cause quicker melting and make ice sheets less reflective. An
extractive push has increased in some parts of the region alongside
worsening socio-climatic crises (Kröger, 2016a, 2018).

The Arctic remains [a prime target for extractivism]{.underline},
notably for [obtaining the commodities to produce \"green\" or
low-carbon infrastructures]{.underline} instrumental in climate change
mitigation policies (Kuokkanen, 2023). Moreover, the attack on Ukraine
by Russia in February 2022, and the subsequent rush for alternative
energy and raw material sources especially in the European Union, has
led to major new expansion pushes, also in the Arctic (Kopra & Wall,
2022). The sanctions against Russia, and the worsening
climatic-ecological conditions for extraction due to collapsing
permafrost for example, have brought difficulties for the sector in some
parts of Arctic Russia (Kröger, 2023). Visible resource conflicts and
resistance movements are thus just the tip of the iceberg when it comes
to local grievances due to environmental, cultural, and livelihood
losses experienced by many Arctic peoples (Heininen et al., 2022). This
is a topic that can be explored more deeply through theHanaček et al.
Green and climate colonialities: Evidence of Arctic extractivisms
Journal of Political Ecology Vol. 31, 2024 540 intertwined concepts of
extractivism and colonialism, which examine the structural, historical
level where [extractivist hegemonies have been created for the
Arctic.]{.underline}

Extractivism describes those activities that violently remove or extract
large quantities of natural resources, causing major social and
ecological damage (Acosta, 2011). The type, character and degree of
extractivism vary depending on the sector, style of extraction, and
context (Kröger, 2022). According to Gudynas (2021), extractivisms -- in
the plural, as there are many forms, such as mining, fossil fuels,
commercial agriculture and forestry -- entail breaking down existing
local economies and their ecological relationships, with extracted
products profiting national or international business classes or
governments. [Extractivisms,]{.underline} however, are not limited to
biophysical overexploitation and transformation of the environment
(Acosta, 2011; Kröger et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They **[are based on
onto-epistemic violence against Indigenous ways of relating to the
Mother Earth]{.underline}** (de la Cadena & Blaser, 2018). For example,
[replacing the latter with modernist assumptions and ideas where nature
is seen as external and available, \"free\" of people or any constraints
to exploit and appropriate in whatever manner, as fast as
wanted]{.underline}. Therefore, Durante et al. (2021: 20) refer to
extractivisms as \"a particular way of thinking and the properties and
practices organized towards the goal of maximizing benefit through
extraction, which brings in its wake violence and destruction.\" Such
forms of colonialism and extractivism, when part of capitalism, do not
only mean imposing domination from foreign countries and corporations.
Colonialism can also be imposed and continuously sustained internally
within a nation state (Casanova, 1965; Churchill & LaDuke, 1992;
Maldonado-Torres, 2016). [Arctic extractivisms exist with several forms
of colonial relations (]{.underline}Hanaček et al., 2022).

The concept [of climate colonialism refers to]{.underline} [how glaciers
melting, sea levels rising, and storms negatively affect those who have
least contributed to the climate crisis, such as Indigenous peoples,
ethnic minorities, and the impoverished]{.underline} (Landrum & Holland,
2020; Naykanchina, 2012). Systems supporting colonialisms, such as
patriarchy, racism, Eurocentrism, and extractivism not only contribute
to such conditions, but also further impose their own climate change
perspectives and \"solutions\" (Sheller, 2023). Climate change is in
part a result of colonial extractivism, and a greater discussion of this
connection in the literature has long been necessary (Bhambra & Newell,
2023; Moore, 2016). For instance, [projected green solutions and global
climate interventions reproduce extractive understandings and dominant
discourses, including viewing climate as merely a biophysical problem to
be remedied with technologies, finance, and better economic
modelling]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Sultana, 2022). Apolitical
approaches, with little to no acknowledgment of global colonial
histories, also include adaptation, vulnerability, and mitigation
strategies that continue to displace historically impoverished peoples
from their land, disrupting plural ways of life and knowledge (Cameron,
2012). According to Gelderloos (2022) and Osborne & Carlson (2023),
[industrial expansion and present forms of pollution are intrinsically
linked to the colonial state]{.underline}. The current climate crisis is
the result of a state-corporate nexus responsible for atmospheric
change. However, the mainstream crisis solution to this nexus is based
on a carbon reduction 2030 goal, which is inherently linked to existing
fossil fuel and green extractivist initiatives (ibid).

Put simply, both green extractivism and the climate crisis perpetuate
logics of colonialism and imperialism through negative
socio-environmental impacts, discursive (green) ignorance, climate
crisis denial, and attempts to create domination and hegemony by
extractivist forces -- all these actions further driving the climate
catastrophe (DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023; Sultana, 2022;
Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). The term \"necrocene,\" or the new era
of death and extinction on Earth, refers to such denial and silencing of
historical and present struggles against socio-ecological breakdown
(Batalla, 2020; Clark, 2021; Mbembe, 2019). [Therefore, the poly-crisis
including climatic breakdowns should be seen primarily as a political
state and a colonial condition (Sheller, 2023). Combined, green
extractivism and climate crises form part of ongoing
colonialities]{.underline}

As we argue throughout this paper, the distinctive thing about recent
National Security Strategies is their deployment of integration as the
principal foreign policy and security strategy. It is telling that
Bush's claim of [''either **you are with us, or you are with the
terrorists''**]{.underline} (Bush, 2001) [relies not on a
straightforward binary, as is sometimes suggested, but **a process of
incorporation**]{.underline}. It is not simply us versus them, but with
us, a mode of operating alongside, or, in the words of one of Bush's
most enthusiastic supporters, ''shoulder to shoulder'' (Blair, 2001; see
White & Wintour, 2001[). This works more widely through a combination of
threats and promises, as in this statement about the
Palestinians:]{.underline} ''[If Palestinians embrace democracy and the
rule of law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can
count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian
state'']{.underline} (The White House, 2002b: 9). [Likewise, it can be
found in some of remarks of the British Prime Minister Blair (2004)
about the significance of democracy in Afghanistan, Africa and
Iraq.]{.underline} Equally Bush's notorious '[axis of evil' speech did
not simply name North Korea, Iran and Iraq as its members, but suggested
that ''states like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis
of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world'']{.underline} (Bush,
2002a, emphasis added). A comparison of the like, alongside the ''with
the terrorists'' is actually a more complicated approach to the choosing
of sides and the drawing of lines than is generally credited. Simple
binary oppositions are less useful to an understanding here than the
process of incorporation and the policy of integration. [These examples
indicate the policy of integration or exclusion being adopted by the US
and followed by certain allies. It warns those failing to adopt US
values (principally liberal 'representative' democracy and market
capitalism)]{.underline}, that they will be excluded from an
American-centric world. The place of US allies in these representations
is not unimportant. Indeed, the strength of the US discourse relies also
on its reflection and reiteration by other key allies, especially in
Europe. Above and beyond the dismissive pronouncements of Rumsfeld about
Europe's ''Old'' and ''New'' e a conception that was inchoately
articulated as early as the 1992 DPGethe dissent of (even some)Europeans
is a problemfor theUSin itsworld-making endeavours
(seeBialasiewicz&Minca, 2005). It is not surprising, then, that
following his re-election,George W. Bush and Condoleeza Rice embarked
almost immediately on a ''bridge-building'' tour across Europe, [noting
not trans-Atlantic differences but ''the great alliance of freedom''
that unites the United States and Europe]{.underline} (Bush, 2005). [For
although the United States may construct itself as the undisputed leader
in the new global scenario, its ''right'' e and the right of its
moral-political ''mission'' of spreading ''freedom and
justice'']{.underline} e relies on its amplification and support by
allies. The construction of the United States' world role relies also on
the selective placement and representation of other international actors
who are ''hailed'' into specific subject positions (see Weldes, Laffey,
Gusterson, & Duvall, 1999). Of course, different actors are granted
different roles and different degrees of agency in the global script:
the place of key European allies is different from that bestowed upon
the peripheral and semi-peripheral states that make part of the
''coalition of the willing''[. Both, however, are vital in sustaining
the representation of the US as the leader of a shared world of values
and ideals. Indeed, the 'lone superpower' has little influence in the
absence of support.]{.underline}

Situating Settler Traditions [Settler traditions of place are an
epistemic genealogy---the ethics, logics, and ideologies foundational to
a knowledge system that have been passed down across generations, a
knowledge framework that establishes what is known]{.underline} (the
socially constructed commonsense of a culture), [how things come to be
known]{.underline} (the process of attaining new knowledge), [how the
world is to be interpreted according to what is known]{.underline} (the
social construction of reality), [and how the self is known in relation
to perceived reality]{.underline} (the politics of self). [Tradition is
used]{.underline} as a conceptual tool [allowing for domination to be
empha- sized as an on-going historical process, while also
allowing]{.underline} for epistemology [as tradition to simultaneously
be evolutionary and a cherished cultural artifact.]{.underline} As a
cultural product, [settler traditions of place are transmitted across
generations through discipline, teaching, modeling and other forms of
direct and subtle so- cial communication resulting in normalized habits,
beliefs, values, and practices.]{.underline} In speaking about "western
cultural traditions," Val Plumood (2002) argues that [there are
"epistemic and moral limitations" embedded in]{.underline} these
[traditions---these normalized habits---that perpetuate hierarchized
notions of the world that privi- lege white-hetero-landowning
males]{.underline} (99). As Martusewicz et al. (2011) explain, [these
subtle discourses manifest as taken-for-granted cultural assumptions
that are rooted in racism, sexism, classism that intertwine with and
reflect the cultivation of violent relationships with the
more-than-human world and natural systems that we depend on for
life]{.underline} (119). The tradition in question here is the social
air that penetrates the Western world, interacting with human beings
whether they want it to or not. Using tradition as a metaphor for
epistemology allows me to emphasize the way [epistemology can im- pact
every aspect of life while remaining removed from a deterministic
position. Embedded in discourse, tradition appears as ever-present;
despite this, individual social actors have the agency to break
tradition.]{.underline} Consequently, in the same way that an individual
breaks from familial, cultural, or religious tradition and faces the
ramifications for transgressing, epistemic transgression can also incur
social fallout and cause friction. [When an individual epistemically
transgresses, they employ an epistemic praxis]{.underline} (the
operationalization of an alternative or critical epistemology) [that
goes against the grain and is counter to the tradition that defines the
social environment.]{.underline} For conversations concerning the
cultivation of criticality (like the one herein) [this break in
tradition is absolutely desirable and can inspire]{.underline} what Jose
́ Medina (2013) calls [epistemic friction. Epistemic friction is
contained in those uncomfortable moments in which our taken-for-granted
assumptions about the world begin to crack.]{.underline} [These moments
can be transformative and cat- alyze critical consciousness to imagine
and hopefully actualize an alternative epistemology.]{.underline}

#### Western power is centrally a project in knowledge production-- with Enlightenment rationality, Empire came to be the ability to know and classify difference.

**[The space of the circle projected by the metaphysical eye before the
Enlightenment was an empty or uninhabited space.]{.underline}** [Those
who filled it were \"seen\" as nomadic --- separated, in their mobility,
from the land --- and insofar as this nomadic existence precluded
cultivating and inhabiting it, errantly nonhuman.]{.underline} I will
return in the last chapter to think positively this negative
representation of the \"savage\" or \"barbarian\" Other beyond the
circumference of the metropolitan circle. My purpose here is simply to
make the ideological implications of this representation explicit.
Despite the obvious evidence that would belie such a projection, this is
the pervasive testimony of European travelers and colonists in North and
South America and in Africa, as many historians of colonial encounters
have shown.69 As Peter Hulme puts this calculatively blind \[ignorant\]
representation of the indigenous people of the \"New World\" by their
European \"visitors\": The strategies of colonial discourse were
directed in the first place at demonstrating a separation between the
desired land and its native inhabitants. Baffled at the complex but
effective native system of food production, the English seem to have
latched on to the one (minor) facet of behaviour that they thought they
recognized --- mobility, and argued on that basis an absence of proper
connection between the land and its first inhabitants.70 Drawing from
Francis Jennings\'s The Invasion of America, Hulme goes on to give
examples of this early ideological representation of the space within
the colonial circle, suggesting the degree to which it justified the
overt use of violence by the colonizers: In 1612 the Jesuit missionary
Pierre Biard, describing Canadian Amerindians, wrote: Thus four thousand
Indians at most roam through, rather than occupy, these vast stretches
of inland territory and seashore. For they are a nomadic people, living
in the forests and scattered over wide spaces as is natural for those
who live by hunting and fishing only; \"roam rather than occupy\" being
a translation of Biard\'s \"non tenentur, sed percurruntur.\" In 1625
Samuel Purchas wrote of the Virginia Algonquian: so bad people, having
little of Humanitie but shape, ignorant of Civilitie, of Arts, of
Religion; more brutish then the beasts they hunt, more wild and unmanly
then that unmanned wild Countrey which they range rather then inhabite.
And in 1629 in New England John Winthrop assimilated Purchas\'s point to
the legal argument of vacuum domicilium by which the Indian had
\"natural\" but not \"civil\" rights over the land because they had not
\"subdued\" it.71 What, however, [the panoptic Eurocentric eye of the
Enlightenment comes to see in the space within this reconfigured trope
of the circle is no longer --- or at least not exclusively --- a vast
\"uninhabited\" emptiness, in which the natives do not count as human
beings. Rather, it comes primarily to see an
uninformed]{.underline} **[terra incognita.]{.underline}** As the texts
of early European travel writers (and social historians) invariably
characterize this amorphous and ahistorical \"new world,\" the European
panoptic gaze falls on an \"unimproved\" space. As the privative prefix
emphatically suggests, it is **[a space-time in which everything in
it]{.underline}** --- flora, fauna, minerals, animals, and, later, human
beings --- **[is seen and encoded]{.underline}** [not so much as
threatening, though that meaning is clearly there as
well,]{.underline} **[as wasteful or uneconomical]{.underline}** and
thus as an untended fallow (female) terrain calling futurally for the
beneficial ministrations of the (adult, male) center.72 The
predestinarian metaphorics of the circle precipitates a whole rhetoric
of moral necessity. The \"wilderness\" as \"underdeveloped\" or
\"unimproved\" or \"uncultivated\" (i.e., \"unfulfilled\" or
\"uncircular\") space must, as the privative prefixes demand, be
developed, improved, cultivated (i.e., fulfilled or circularized).
Indeed, it is the wilderness\'s destiny. From this representation of the
colonial Others as mired in and by their own chaotic primordial
condition, one of the most debilitating of which is unproductive
perpetual war, [it is an easy step to representing them]{.underline}, as
American writers and historians did the Indian race in the nineteenth
century, **[as either self-doomed]{.underline}**73 **[or appealing to
the Europe]{.underline}**an **[to save them from themselves by way of
imposing his peace on their multiply wasteful strife.]{.underline}**74
Referring to John Barrow\'s representative (enlightened)
\"anticonquest\" narrative about his travels as an agent of the British
colonial governor in the interior of the Cape Colony at the end of the
eighteenth century, Mary Louise Pratt writes: [The visual descriptions
presuppose --- naturalize --- a transformative project embodied in the
Europeans.]{.underline} Often the project surfaces explicitly in
Barrow\'s text, in visions of \"improvement\" whose value is often
expressed as aesthetic\.... [It is the task of the advanced scouts for
capitalist \"improvement\"
to]{.underline} **[encode]{.underline}** [what]{.underline} **[the]{.underline}**y [encounter
as \"**unimproved**\" and]{.underline}, in keeping with the terms of the
anti-conquest, as disponible, **[available for
improvement.]{.underline}** European aspirations must be represented as
uncontested. Here the textual apartheid that separates landscapes from
people, accounts of inhabitants from accounts of their habitats,
fulfills its logic. The European improving eye produces subsistence
habitats as \"empty\" landscapes, meaningful only in terms of a
capitalist future and of their potential for producing a marketable
surplus. From the point of view of their inhabitants, of course, these
same spaces are lived as intensely humanized, saturated with local
history and meaning, where plants, creatures, and geographical
formations have names, uses, symbolic functions, histories, places in
indigenous knowledge formations.75 This is an acute observation about
the \"anti-conquest\" imperialist discourse of Enlightenment travel
writing. But it is limited by its characteristic restriction of the word
\"improvement\" to the historical context of modern capitalism (though
the aside referring to the expression of the vision of improvement in
aesthetic terms is suggestive). Like so much \"postcolonial\" criticism,
its historicist problematic is blind \[ignorant\] to the genealogy of
this modern \"anti-conquest\" concept. [It fails to see that the
rhetoric of \"improvement\" is a capitalist extension of a much older
system of imperial tropes, one that, in naturalizing the latter,
obscures the will to power over the Other that is visible in its earlier
form.]{.underline} This word, that is, not only looks forward to
\"underdeveloped,\" the sedimented counterword that constitutes the base
of the neocolonialist discourse of late capitalism, as Pratt seems to be
suggesting. It also harks back to what Enrique Dussel calls the
\"developmental fallacy\" informing Enlightenment philosophy of history
from Adam Smith and John Locke through Hegel and a certain Marx to
Habermas. Tracing the genealogy of Habermas\'s Eurocentric
representation of modernity back to Hegel, Dussel writes: In the
Vorlesungen uber die Philosophic der Weltgeschichte, Hegel portrays
world history (Weltgeschichte) as the self-realization of God, as a
theodicy of reason and of liberty (Freiheit), and as a process of
Enlightenment (Aufklarung)\.... In Hegelian ontology, the concept of
development (Enttvicklung) plays a central role. This concept determines
the movement of the concept (Begriff) until it culminates in the idea
--- that is, as it moves from indeterminate being to the absolute
knowledge in the Logic. Development\... unfolds according to a linear
dialectic; although originally an ontological category, today it is
primarily considered as a sociological one with implications for world
history. Furthermore, this development has a direction: Universal
history goes from East to West. Europe is absolutely the end of
universal history. Asia is the beginning. But this alleged East-West
movement clearly precludes Latin America and Africa from world history
and characterizes Asia as essentially confined to a state of immaturity
and childhood (Kindheit)\.... The immaturity (Umreife) marking America
is total and physical; even the vegetables and the animals are more
primitive, brutal, monstrous, or simply more weak or degenerate.76 Even
more fundamentally, Pratt\'s \"unimproved\" has its origins in the more
deeply inscribed metaphorics of the seed and its cultivation, as
Dussel\'s recurrent invocation of the rhetoric of \"immaturity\" that
informs the Hegelian discourse suggests. This is the trope (which is
also an aesthetics) that, along with the gaze and the centered circle,
informs the very etymology of \"metaphysics\" and that is encoded and
naturalized in the truth discourse of the Occident. That is to say, the
genealogy of the word \"improvement\" in the discourse of
post-Enlightenment travel literature is traceable to the origins of
Occidental history. (The metaphor of the \"virgin land,\" which, as I
have intimated, is equally pervasive in the discourse of early
colonialism, constitutes a particularly telling gendered allotrope of
this metaphorical system circulating around the seed. It focalizes the
identification of the panoptic gaze that perceives this \"unimproved\"
circular space with the brutal phallic will.)77 A retrieval of the
equally inaugural visual metaphorics with which it is affiliated will
bring into visibility the ideological agenda hidden in the benign
connotations of the metaphor of \"improvement.\" In the positivist
Enlightenment, [the \"unimproved\" space of the \"wilderness\" is
understood as a darkness, in the sense not so much of savage or
barbarous (though, again, that meaning resonates in the word as well),
as of a potentially knowable and usable unknown.]{.underline} What its
eye beholds primarily is a terrain that, as the European cliche about
the \"inscrutability\" of the Orient has it, compels knowing and naming
precisely because its darkly unimproved state resists scrutiny and
domestication. For the French natural scientist Michel Adanson, for
example, the world of nature was a confused mingling of beings that seem
to have been brought together by chance: here, gold is mixed with
another metal, with stone, with earth; there, the violet grows side by
side with an oak. Among these plants, too, wander the quadruped, the
reptile, and the insect; the fishes are confused, one might say, with
the aqueous element in which they swim, and with the plants grow in the
depth of the waters\.... This mixture is indeed so general and so
multifarious that it appears to be one of nature\'s laws.78 In
thematizing this knowledge-producing naming --- this Linnaean
classificatory motif---I do not, despite its decisive contribution to
the imperial project proper, want to limit its origins to the
Enlightenment. As the natural affiliation of seed with light (the
spatialization of differential temporal phenomena) suggests, its
ultimate origin lies in the Occident\'s appropriation of the biblical
narrative of Adam, armed with the Logos, naming the beasts. In
combinations with the classical apotheosis of the sun/seed, this
narrative has played a decisive role of persuasion throughout the
history of Christian European imperial conquest, not least in that
history of genocidal American expansionism inaugurated by the Adamic
Puritans\' pacification of the American wilderness.79 [To put it
generally, then, this historically developed Enlightenment version of
the imperial circle is understood not simply as an ever-expanding
boundary or frontier tethered to the luminous center, but simultaneously
as an unending process of enlightening and internalizing the outside
darkness]{.underline}, or, what is the same thing, of bringing its
(female) fallowness to fruition. This understanding of the relation
between center and periphery is, of course, what Enlightenment Europe
called its mission civilisatrice. And, it should not be overlooked, its
ultimate origin is the Roman imperial model: the relation between a
(manly) civilized Rome, the Metropolis --- the City as measure --- and
the uncivilized periphery, the amorphous, unknown, and unnamed (obscure)
or \"unimproved\" (uncultivated) provinces that were not yet
incorporated into the orbis terrarum, that is, were not yet individuated
into cities or integrated parts of the Metropolitan
City. [But]{.underline} **[to speak of the circular space perceived by
the Eurocentric eye of the Enlightenment as an unknown, unnamed, and
unimproved space that \"demands\" to be known, named, and improved is to
realize that the civilizing or enlightening mission of the Enlightenment
also requires specification both of the articulation of that space and
of the effects of that spatial economy on knowledge and
power.]{.underline}** To put it generally, [the Eurocentric solar or
panoptic eye of the Enlightenment turned the earlier \"emptiness\" of
the circle of its vision into]{.underline} [**a
measurable** space]{.underline}. Whereas the imperial eye of the
pre-Enlightenment --- the early Spanish conquistadores, for example ---
tended to (over)see the circle it projected as a generalized amorphous
[and thus immediately **plunderable space**]{.underline}, the
Enlightenment eye came to oversee the (always expanding) circle it
projected as a mappable organic space, a vital differential world in
which the comparative knowledge of its details enhances the power of the
encompassing eye of the beholder over its organic \"branching.\" As his
presiding analogy between the domain of knowledge and the geographical
world clearly suggests, what the French philosophe D\'Alembert says in
1751 about the domain of knowledge before and after the emergence of the
mapping eye in his Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot
applies as well to the relationship between the Enlightenment Metropolis
and the provinces. Indeed, it applies right down to the roles that
\"travelers\'\" narratives and the ensuing opening of lines of
communication to the Metropolis play in the process of mastering the
labyrinthine Other: The execution \[\"of a genealogical or encyclopedic
tree which will gather the various branches of knowledge together under
a single point of view\"\] is not without difficulty\... .The general
system of the sciences and the arts is a sort of labyrinth, a torturous
road which the intellect enters without quite knowing what direction to
take\.... The discontinuity of these operations is a necessary effect of
the very generation of ideas. However philosophic this disorder may be
on the part of the soul, an encyclopedic tree which attempted to portray
it would be disfigured, indeed utterly destroyed\.... It is not the same
with the encyclopedic arrangement of our knowledge. This consists of
collecting knowledge into the smallest area possible and of placing the
philosopher at a vantage point, so to speak, high above the vast
labyrinth, whence he can perceive the principal sciences and the arts
simultaneously. From there he can see at a glance the objects of their
speculations and the operations which can be made on these objects; he
can discern the general branches of human knowledge, the points that
separate or unite them; and sometimes he can even glimpse the secrets
that related them to one another. It is a kind of world map which is to
show the principal countries, their position and their mutual
dependence, the road that leads directly from one to another. This road
is often cut by a thousand obstacles, which are known in each country
only to the inhabitants or to travelers, and which cannot be represented
except in individual, highly detailed maps. These individual maps will
be the different articles of the Encyclopedia and the Tree or Systematic
Chart will be its world map.80 The difference between the two historical
moments, in other words, is the difference between a mapped space
understood, as in the case of the early European explorers, as a
periplum (\"not as land seen on a map/but sea bord seen by men
sailing\"),81 and a mapped space conceived, as Foucault has shown, as a
self-consciously mediative mode of knowledge/power production analogous
in its structure to, if not entirely dependent on, the \"tables\" based
on the ontologically, invariably racially, grounded systems of
classification that emerged in the Enlightenment. These were the
polyvalent taxonomic tables --- best exemplified by the Systema Naturae
(1735), Philosophia Botanica (1751), and Species Plantarum (1753) of
Linnaeus, the Histoire naturelle (1749) of Buffon, the Nosologie
methodique (1772) of Boissier de Sauvages (\"the Linnaeus of
diseases\"),82 and the Families des plantes (1763) of Michel Adanson83
--- that differentiated, named, graded, and accommodated an amorphous
organic multiplicity within an inclusive structure that miniaturizes and
renders visible a larger, otherwise invisible, and \"ungraspable\"
totality. As such, **[they became the disciplinary model for the
classroom, the mass production factory, the penal institution, the
medical clinic, the psychiatric hospital, the capitalist system of
economic exchange, and the practice of military warfare in the
\"disciplinary society]{.underline}**\": The first of the great
operations of discipline is\... the constitution of \"tableaux
vivants,\" which transform the confused, useless or dangerous multitudes
into ordered multiplicities. The drawing up of \"tables\" was one of the
great problems of the scientific, political and economic technology of
the eighteenth century: how one was to arrange botanical and zoological
gardens, and construct at the same time rational classifications of
living beings; how one was to observe, supervise, regularize the
circulation of commodities and money and thus build up an economic table
that might serve as the principle of the increase of wealth; how one was
to inspect men, observe their presence and absence and constitute a
general and permanent register of the armed forces; how one was to
distribute patients, separate them from one another, divide up the
hospital space and make a systematic classification of diseases: these
were all twin operations in which the two elements --- distribution and
analysis, supervision and intelligibility --- are inextricably bound up.
In the eighteenth century the table was both a technique of power and a
procedure of knowledge. [It was a question of organizing the multiple,
of providing oneself with an instrument to cover it and to master it; it
was a question of imposing upon it an \"order.]{.underline}\"84 To these
differentiated dedifferentiated (accommodational) \"imperial\"
structures produced by the miniaturization and spatialization of time
should be added the reduction and hierarchized structuration of
languages, of gender and race relations, and, not least, of the
discourse and practice --- the visualization or re-presentation and
administration of --- the nation-state and the colonial empire. Foucault
does not explicitly elaborate these imperial structures in his
discussion of the spatialization of knowledge and of the table as the
model of an affiliated comprehensive relay of strategic disciplinary
social practices. But his very overdetermination of the table as
polyvalent model implies them. Thus, to focus on the latter category of
this series of discursive practices, which we should remember contains
the others, it is no accident that Foucault concludes the chapter in
Discipline and Punish from which the above resonant passage is drawn
with a reference to the decisive role that the table plays in the advent
of the Napoleonic Empire. In this particular case, [the form the table
takes is that of]{.underline} **[a \"politics\... conceived as a
continuation]{.underline}**, if not exactly and directly [**of war**, at
least of]{.underline} **[the military model]{.underline}** [as a
fundamental means of preventing civil disorder]{.underline}\":
\"Discipline must be made national,\" said Guibert. \"The state that I
depict will have a simple, reliable, easily controlled administration.
It will resemble those huge machines, which by quite uncomplicated means
produce great effects; the strength of this state will spring from its
own strength, its prosperity from its own prosperity. Time, which
destroys all, will increase its power. It will disprove that vulgar
prejudice by which we are made to imagine that empires are subjected to
an imperious law of decline and ruin\.... \" The Napoleonic regime was
not far off and with it the form of state that was to survive it and, we
must not forget, the foundations of which were laid not only by jurists,
but also by soldiers, not only councillors of state, but also junior
officers, not only the men of the courts, but also the men of the camps.
The Roman reference that accompanied this formation certainly bears with
it this double index: citizens and legionnaires, law and manoeuvres.85
Edward Said has complained that Foucault did not elaborate the
connection between the supervisory gaze that projects its circumscribed
object in the spatial figure of the classificatory table and the
patriarchal/ racial colonial project. Nevertheless, this extension, both
in its general and specific imperatives vis-a-vis knowledge and power,
is inherent in the very structure of its visual projection.86 As Said
has shown in Orientalism, his (dis)seminal appropriation of Foucault\'s
analysis of the panoptic gaze, [Napoleon\'s conquest of Egypt was not,
as in earlier imperial campaigns, simply a military
project.]{.underline}87 In accordance with the general imperatives of
the mode of metaphysical thinking embodied in the tables (what Said
calls the \"textual/schematic\" attitude), [it was,
rather,]{.underline} **[a military project that was simultaneously and
integrally a project of knowledge production: a project, that is,
intended to render \"totally accessible to European scrutiny\" \"a land
of obscurity and a part of the Orient hitherto known at second hand
through the exploits of earlier travelers, scholars and
conquerors.]{.underline}**\"88 More specifically, it was no accident, to
recall Foucault\'s analysis of the gaze-produced table, that Napoleon\'s
Egyptian expedition included not only an army of soldiers but an army of
scholars, whose purpose was to produce a body of differentiated
knowledge that would \"win the hearts and minds\" of the Egyptians to
the French idea of \"Europe\" and that could be utilized for purposes of
establishing a more materially and politically productive dominion over
the colonized. Referring to \"that great collective appropriation of one
country by another,\" the twenty-three-volume Description de l\'Egypte
compiled by the scholars of the French Institut, \"the learned division
of Napoleon\'s army,\" Said writes: To restore a region from its present
barbarism to its former classical greatness; to instruct (for its own
benefit) the Orient in the ways of the modern West; **[to subordinate or
underplay military power in order to aggrandize the project of glorious
knowledge acquired in the process of political domination of the
Orient]{.underline}**; to formulate the Orient, to give it shape,
identity, definition with full recognition of its place in memory, its
importance to imperial strategy, and its \"natural\" role as an
appendage to Europe; to dignify all the knowledge collected during
colonial occupation with the title \"contribution to modern learning\"
when the natives had neither been consulted nor treated as anything
except as pretexts for a text whose usefulness was not to the natives;
to feel oneself as a European in command, almost at will, of Oriental
history, time, and geography; to institute new areas of specialization;
to establish new disciplines; to divide, deploy, schematize, tabulate,
index, and record everything in sight (and out of sight); to make out of
every observable detail a generalization and out of every generalization
an immutable law about the Oriental nature, temperament, mentality,
custom, or type; and, above all, to transmute living reality into the
stuff of texts, to possess (or think one possesses) actuality mainly
because nothing in the Orient seems to resist one\'s powers: these are
the features of Orientalist projection entirely realized in the
Description de l\'Egypte, itself enabled and reinforced by Napoleon\'s
wholly Orientalist engulfment of Egypt by the instruments of Western
knowledge and power.89 Nor, finally, is it an accident that the emergent
Linnaean system of classification --- of identifying, naming, and
classifying the flora and fauna of nature --- inaugurated the global
taxonomic projects, most notably that of his student Anders Sparrman,90
that became the essential European means of producing a modern or
neoimperialist discourse, a discourse that, in the name of the truth of
empirical science, invents or constructs the Other in the image of the
First World. I am referring to what Mary Louise Pratt, in her
Foucauldian study of the relationship between scientific travel writing
and colonialism in South Africa and Latin America, has called the
\"anti-conquest narrative.\" **[This is the narrative \"in which the
naturalist naturalizes the bourgeois European\'s own global presence and
authority\" to differentiate its \"benign\" truth-producing motive from
an earlier, overtly violent imperial narrative.]{.underline}** In a way
that recalls Foucault\'s and Said\'s differentiation of the visible and
\"inefficient\" deployment of power in the ancien regime from the more
invisible and materially and politically economical version of the
Enlightenment, Pratt observes: Natural history asserted an urban,
lettered, male authority over the whole of the planet; it elaborated a
rationalizing, extractive, dissociative understanding which overlaid
functional, experiential relations among people, plants, and animals. In
these respects, it figures a certain kind of global hegemony, notably
one based on possession of land and resources rather than control over
routes. At the same time, in and of itself, the system of nature as a
descriptive paradigm was an utterly benign and abstract appropriation of
the planet. Claiming no transformative potential whatsoever, it differed
sharply from overly imperial articulations of conquest, conversion,
territorial appropriation, and enslavement. The system created\... a
Utopian, innocent vision of European global authority, which I refer to
as an anti-conquest. The term is intended to emphasize the relational
meaning of natural history, the extent to which it became meaningful
specifically in contrast with an earlier imperial, and prebourgeois,
European expansionist presence.91 The difference between an earlier,
pre-Enlightenment, and a later, post-Enlightenment, configuration of the
internal space of the imperial circle is, of course, crucial to any
understanding of the essence of imperial practice. But my purpose in
thus invoking Foucault\'s analysis of the complicity of the
classificatory table of the Enlightenment with the domination of the
Other in the disciplinary society, and Said\'s and Pratt\'s extension of
Foucault\'s genealogical insight to include the modern European imperial
project, is not to bring a story about the development of the technology
of European colonialism to its fulfillment and narrative closure, one
that renders prior technologies of power anachronistic. It is, rather,
to retrieve a fundamental dimension of this story that has been
obliterated from memory even as it resonates unthought in the very
contemporary language these postcolonial critics use to indict the truth
discourse of the West as \"imperial.\" [I want to suggest that the
classificatory table, as microcosm of a larger spatial totality and as
the model for wider \"imperial\" practices (**the mass production
process, the panoptic penal system, the medical and psychiatric
hospital, the family, the classroom, the nation-state, the colonial
administration, and so on), is grounded in and enabled by the
metaphysical principle of principles**]{.underline} or, as Enrique
Dussel puts it, \"the ideology of ideologies\":92 that **[Identity is
the condition for the possibility of difference and not the other way
around.]{.underline}** Unlike its predecessor in the ancien
regime, [metaphysical inquiry at this advanced Enlightenment stage does
not obliterate the contradictory, amorphous, unimproved, and
\"ahistorical\" Other]{.underline} from the vantage point of a visible
\"center elsewhere.\" [It \"acknowledges\" this
Other]{.underline}\'s [claims as contributive to (the knowledge of) the
larger self-identical Whole.]{.underline} In other words, it
\"classifies\" the amorphous Others from the vantage point of an
invisible \"center elsewhere.\" It differentiates these Others into
discrete phenomena --- attributes distinguishing identities to them ---
within and in behalf of a prior encompassing self-present total
Identity. This individuation of the amorphous Other conveys a sense of
the sovereign integrity of the differentiated entities, but it obscures
the fact that their uniqueness is entirely dependent on a dominant
synchronic Totality, the always present and determining center of which
is always out of sight. **[To acquire validity the differentiated entity
must accommodate its differential partiality to the prior Totality,
must, that is, objectify and subordinate itself to]{.underline}** ---
take its proper place within --- **[the gridded structure of the
dominant Identity.]{.underline}** To become a subject it must heed the
call --- the hailing --- of the Subject. As his invocation of the
ontological metaphorics of the center and the circle should suggest,
what the Lacanian Marxist Louis Althusser says about \"the
interpellation of the individual as subject\" --- the (subjected)
subject invented by the bourgeois capitalist Enlightenment --- applies
by extension to the spatial economy of the (neo)imperial project as
such: The Absolute Subject occupies the unique place of the Centre, and
interpellates around it the infinity of individuals into subjects in a
double mirror-connexion such that it subjects the subjects to the
Subject, while giving them in the Subject in which each subject can
contemplate its own image (present and future) the guarantee that this
really concerns them and Him\.... The duplicate mirror-structure of
ideology ensures simultaneously: 1. the interpellation of
\'individuals\' as subjects; 2. their subjection to the Subject; 3. the
mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects\' recognition
of each other, and finally the subject\'s recognition of himself; 4. the
absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition
that the subjects recognize what they are and behave accordingly,
everything will be all right: Amen --- \"So be it.\" Result: caught in
this quadruple system of interpellation as subjects, of subjection to
the Subject, of universal recognition and of absolute guarantee, the
subjects \"work,\" they \"work by themselves\" in the vast majority of
cases, with the exception of the \"bad subjects\" who on occasion
provoke the intervention of one of the detachments of the (repressive)
State apparatus. But the vast majority of (good) subjects work all right
\"all by themselves,\" i.e. by ideology (whose concrete forms are
realized in the Ideological State Apparatuses).93 The fulfillment of
this promissory accommodational project is called variously \"beauty,\"
\"perfection,\" or, most tellingly, \"peace\" (pax). [In this
reconstellated context the differential entity becomes, indeed,
productive, but what it produces is a product of exchange value that
benefits the economy and increases the authority of the dominant
structure projected by the \"supervisory gaze\" or, alternatively, the
invisible imperial \"Subject\" or \"center elsewhere.]{.underline}\"
This political economy, in the sociopolitical domain, is what Foucault
calls \"the repressive hypothesis.\" Derived in part from its
recognition of the ancien regime\'s economically and politically
wasteful economy of power, this is the seductive ruse of the emergent
capitalist bourgeoisie that strategically represents knowledge (of the
Other) as external to and the essential agent of deliverance from the
constraints of power. It is the ruse that conceals the complicity
between (Western) truth and power: We must cease once and for all to
describe the effects of power in negative terms: it \"excludes,\" it
\"represses,\" it \"censors,\" it \"abstracts,\" it \"masks,\" it
\"conceals.\" In fact, power produces; it produces reality; it produces
domains of objects and rituals of truth. The individual and the
knowledge that may be gained of him belong to this production.94

#### The imperial academy is the nexus of imperial knowledge production -- the direction of research in the academy [including debate]{.underline} directly impacts the direction of The Empire.

Looking forward: academic and practitioner pushback against colonialism,
and cautionary tales

[Given the historical and ongoing mutual complicity between knowledge
producers and policy-makers in upholding imperial and racial orders, we
now consider the responsibilities, possibilities and challenges faced
in altering the nature of that nexus. Doing so requires turning to what
Danso and Aning call an 'episteme of alternativity';]{.underline}41 [and
the primary way for academics to enact this would be to draw on
anti-colonial practice and legacies]{.underline}, rather than imperial
competition, [as the foundation of their theorizing]{.underline}.

Thus, in his article, Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh forefronts global South
policy-makers and focuses on the nuclear order (a topic that is
typically associated with realist IR) to demonstrate how it can be
approached through an alternative, critical epistemology.42 Disrupting
the 'Great Power gaze', Mpofu-Walsh asks what the politics of
non-proliferation looks like from the perspective of the global South,
especially the African continent as the sole nuclear weapon-free zone
(NWFZ). There, denuclearization is fundamentally linked to
decolonization. Thus anti-colonial goals, rather than
hegemonic/imperialist competition, are at the root of both policy and
theorizing. How different would IR knowledge and theories on nuclear
weapons be if African praxis and the importance of NWFZs were taken
seriously? Turning to the Middle East, Gani similarly argues in her
article that the inclusion of non-western history and voices---from
policy-makers to activists and scholars---in think-tank discussions can
mitigate the latent colonialism that shapes western policy.43

Nevertheless, [even with an incorporation of non-western
practice]{.underline} and knowledge in policy making and scholarly
theorizing, [multiple perspectives that are marginalized even in the
local context, owing to class or gender, may continue to go
unheard]{.underline}.44 One crucial way in which both academics and
practitioners can challenge such patterns is by [adopting a more
expansive reading of what constitutes 'knowledge' and indeed
'practice']{.underline}. In doing so, we can dismantle some of the
constructed and false hierarchies between elite 'knowledge' and
'research' on one hand, and local 'tradition' on the other.45 The former
is assumed to be objective, reliable and associated with western (and
western-validated) universities; while the latter is viewed as
subjective, unscientific and commonly associated with Indigenous,
racialized, grassroots communities. Assumptions about who counts as a
true knowledge producer or 'expert' is not
only elitist but heavily racialized and gendered. Definitions of who
counts as a 'practitioner' are equally narrow, so that scholars or
policy-makers may place much weight on the views and actions of state,
global governance and corporate practitioners, but do not view as equal
practitioners those involved in everyday practice in their
communities---those who in fact sustain their ecology, livelihoods,
security and identities, all while having to navigate the impact of
top-down policies.46

Both the articles by Jan Wilkens and Alvine Datchoua-Tirvaudey on
climate justice, and by Althea Rivas and Mariam Safi on the organizing
and practices of Afghan women, share knowledge from non-elite local
communities and challenge the above binaries and hierarchies. In their
article on climate justice in the Arctic and the Mediterranean, Wilkens
and Datchoua-Tirvaudey explain that academic--practitioner knowledge
exchange has often been a contributing factor in continued climate
injustice.47 The existing patterns of this knowledge exchange on climate
governance are dependent on hierarchies of knowledge, namely, the
valorization of western/'scientific' knowledge production at the expense
of the needs and knowledges of the Indigenous and local communities most
affected by climate change (i.e. the community-based practitioners,
rather than the institutional/state ones). Moreover, the spaces where
such knowledge exchange takes place are often exclusionary (in who is
invited, in the parameters of discourse and/or in the extortionate costs
of participating), producing an intra-elite debate.48 Having identified
these racialized patterns, they offer a corrective decolonial strategy
for ethical climate governance, founded on practice-based knowledge and
diverse ways of knowing that bring in those excluded insights.

The article by Rivas and Safi also provides an example of how the
academic--practitioner nexus can be 'decolonized', one in which everyday
knowledges of Afghan women, in all their diversity and complexity, are
centred in peacebuilding efforts.49 Their article, co-written by an
academic and a local practitioner, offers a methodology of how to take
into account the internal hierarchies of positionality, interests and
knowledges that are always present when engaging with grassroots
communities for the sake of 'research'. Rivas and Safi also demonstrate
the importance of registering and valuing the unlooked-for, atypical
knowledges from below, such as the subtle observations offered by Afghan
women in rural areas that, contrary to wider assumptions, reflect their
political engagement and interest.

Caution against extractivism in the search for such local knowledge
exchange is at the forefront of both the above contributions.50 Thus
academics should remain reflexive in what the purpose of their research
is, and who really benefits. Moreover, a praxis of decolonizing such
research necessarily entails taking time in a way that is at odds with
the current culture of speedy and multitudinous productivity in
academia: the rapid churning out of articles from 'the field' should
raise appropriate questions about how, why and for whom that research is
being conducted.

Of course, at issue is not just whom but also what we consider as worthy
of scholarly and policy attention, and how inclusive we are of
alternative methodologies. Dependence on state and official archives,
'canonical' theorists, written records and English-language sources all
reproduce the racialized hierarchies inherent in the prioritization of
certain types of knowledge and transmission.51 These factors also close
the door on appreciating the power---both practical and
ideational---generated by collective social action, whose impact cannot
(and should not) be individualized to one or a few visible and often
romanticized protagonists. Recognizing all this and reading into the
silences of the archives should encourage greater attention to
non-hegemonic record-keeping, story-telling and witnessing beyond
elitist and prohibitive barriers---from oral histories, to poetry, art
and independent publishing on paper and online. As anti-colonial and
anti-racist thinkers and activists have long argued, these are the ways
in which those who are dispossessed and marginalized, but also,
consequently, autonomous, have kept their identities, cultures and
memories alive, and sought to prevent their experiences from being
suppressed and erased.52 In the face of systematic racism and the
colonial dismantling of their histories, those who are marginalized are
not, in fact, silent but continue to cultivate and share knowledge, even
if they may lack the resources and type of support received by hegemonic
knowledges (and people).53 Recognizing the equal validity of
marginalized forms of knowledges in both academic and policy realms
pushes back against the de-representation in knowledge exchanges within
elite spaces and formats.

However, it would be erroneous to assume from these arguments that
knowledge produced by so-called elite communities is always bad, and
that knowledge or cultural production from the bottom up is always more
authentic and supports the cause of justice. Srdjan Vucetic\'s article
unsettles multiple binaries, between the elite and the 'masses', as well
as between academics and practitioners.54 Drawing on the work of Stuart
Hall, he complicates what we read as knowledge production and who we see
as its progenitors, challenging the notion of purely top-down (and
imperialist) identity construction. Exploring the role (and popularity)
of nationalistic films and novels as signifiers of this consensus
between policy-makers and wider society, Vucetic demonstrates that it is
not enough to hold accountable only those deemed to possess political
capital, be they policy-makers or academics. Rather, it is necessary
also to challenge the broader pressures and expectations of the public
that produce a collusion between elite and mass discourse, and help to
foreclose the adoption of more critical, justice-oriented policies.
Thus, if we focus solely on academics and practitioners in any
anti-racist work, we miss the uncomfortable reality that narrow,
exclusionary nationalism that foments such racism and imperialist
foreign policies actually enjoys substantial 'buy-in' from people and
may be an accepted part of a local (in this case British) identity.

This observation reinforces the need outlined above for a more expansive
approach to defining knowledges, but this time when interrogating the
generators of coloniality. This in turn allows us to bring into equal
focus other facilitating institutions and mediums of knowledge
dissemination, many of which play a pivotal role in making colonial
tropes and erasures more palatable, accessible, even culturally and
economically valuable. This theme runs through several of the articles
in this special issue. As noted above, Vucetic\'s article focuses on
cultural output; Antweiler looks at museums and schools; Baji considers
the instrumentalization of local folklore for imperialist ideologies in
Japan; Plonski and Manchanda examine the power of racial capitalism via
Israel\'s surveillance industry and marketing; and Gani scrutinizes the
impact of journalistic discourse and think tanks.

Thus far, a lot of responsibility for challenging the racial and
colonial dynamics of the academic--practitioner nexus has been placed
with knowledge producers, whether within or outside academia. But it is
necessary to emphasize that efforts have already been under way, not
only to 'decolonize' our academic disciplines, but to bring that
discourse into the public realm. At that point practitioners need to
carry their share of responsibility in listening to and applying the
expertise (whether academic or community-based) that can foster more
just policies. Instead, the attention policy-makers give to expertise is
often selective and politicized, based not on what can actually improve
people\'s lives but on what helps to justify the existing approaches
adopted by governments. The current denigration and growing
securitization of critical race theory, especially in the United States
but increasingly elsewhere, is an example of attacks on emancipatory
knowledges that challenge power and oppression. Offering another stark
example of this, Amal Abu-Bakare explores in her article the lack of any
serious attempts to confront Islamophobia in society, despite the wealth
of research and expert advice from scholars and community-based
practitioners available to policy-makers.55 Focusing on the cases of the
UK and Canada, she highlights the way in which practitioner
intervention, in this case that of security and police officials, has
actively prevented the adoption of expert guidelines on tackling
Islamophobia on the grounds that they might interfere with their
counterterrorism strategies. In many ways this is a blatant
acknowledgement from policy-makers that their counterterrorism strategy
is inherently built upon racial tropes and discrimination. In contrast,
so-called 'neutral' research on terrorism and/or counterterrorism is
embraced by practitioners, precisely because such research might not ask
uncomfortable questions about the racial foundations or assumptions that
are necessary to enact their policies.

Abu-Bakare\'s article offers an example of the limitations of
academic--practitioner knowledge exchange. Exhorting scholars to make
their research policy relevant does not address the unequal receptivity
towards critical research that may challenge policy. Nor does it
sufficiently take into account the implicit disciplining that can take
place in that process of knowledge exchange. Those very spaces or
channels that are created to facilitate sharing, listening
and negotiation between knowledge producers and practitioners (through
all the blurred boundaries between them) may reproduce and reify
hierarchies through unequal interactions. Is real dialogue possible if
power dynamics render the interlocutors unequal?56 Or, in their efforts
to be heard, taken seriously, and make their presence worthwhile,
academics and other knowledge producers may find themselves being subtly
socialized into the very modes of speech and thought that they sought to
criticize. This can also happen in reverse when grassroots practitioners
share spaces with scholars and elite institutions. The path-breaking
and radical ideas needed to initiate change on some of the most
deep-seated problems in politics and society may be diluted
in such spaces for the sake of pragmatism and communication, undermining
the ability to imagine real alternatives to the status quo. This is not
to say that knowledge producers, whether academic or community-based,
should not engage with policy-makers, but rather that they should be
clear in what they seek to achieve---if, for example, constructive
dialogue or receptivity to expertise is unlikely, it [is at times
necessary and an ethical responsibility simply to register alternative
ideas or contestation]{.underline}. Returning to the point made at the
start of this piece, [this cautions us in how we champion 'impact' and
knowledge--policy engagement, especially if]{.underline} [we only
recognize engagements that supplement and are 'useful' to systems of
power rather than those that hold them to account.]{.underline}

Conclusion

This special issue introduces the readers of International Affairs to
the relatively undertheorized and underhistoricized relationship between
race, knowledge production and policy-making. The articles demonstrate
the ways in which [practitioners have historically relied on research
produced within the academy to]{.underline} inform policy, initiating
the establishment of departments and disciplines for this purpose, [but
they also show the reverse to be equally true: that policy]{.underline},
both foreign and multilateral, [influences the possibilities
and parameters of research,]{.underline} funding and recruitment
practices, and retention of jobs.57 [A key goal of this special issue
has been to foster reflection on the ways in which knowledge
production]{.underline} (in its multifaceted forms) [contributes
to]{.underline} or challenges the practice of [racism and
coloniality]{.underline}; [and the ways in]{.underline} which policy and
practice shape, validate, limit or ignore knowledge production---in ways
that either perpetuate or interrogate coloniality. As the three
categories delineated above
show, [the]{.underline} [academic--practitioner nexus ]{.underline}is
best captured as a series of foreclosures that actively work to uphold
narrowly espoused evolutionary myths of the discipline and [entrench a
naturalization of white-racialized subject positions in academic
discourse on the 'international', while sidelining scholars and
activists, notably women and people
of]{.underline} [colour]{.underline}, who have made undeniable
contributions to analysis of the contemporary world.58 All this brings
into view, as one scholar puts it, 'the fundamental ways in which IR
already is, and always has been, complicit in ordering politics'.59

As we have argued in this introductory piece, the exposure in this
special issue of the deep academic--practitioner nexus confronts and
challenges the 'gaps' discourse advanced at the expense of making
visible the existing reciprocity that disciplines the boundaries of
acceptable enquiry. [The outcome of this disciplining at the theoretical
level can be seen in the construction of paradigms that normalize
Eurocentric presuppositions on 'how the
world]{.underline} [is']{.underline}. But such outcomes are also made
manifest through material implications generated by narrow policy
responses and policy instruments.

[The special issue is]{.underline} not just an exposure, though; it is
also [a]{.underline} [call for repair]{.underline}. [To embark on a
project of repair, those involved in knowledge production]{.underline},
dissemination and application---[within]{.underline} academia, think
tanks, museums, schools, cultural production and policy---first and
foremost [need to recognize that their work is not detached from the
real world, even if they seek to make it so]{.underline}. If the
articles in this special issue have shown [anything, it is that there
can be no realistic and honest demarcation between political and
apolitical knowledge: to assert neutrality is like offering a blank
slate that will inevitably be written over. It is worth knowing
that even with the best intentions, a scholar\'s work is likely to be
co-opted for political ends; and that one\'s erasures and blind spots
regarding injustice, even if innocently produced, will be taken as
justification for inaction and marginalization of these injustices in
the real world.]{.underline}

[Sincerity in seeking to prevent racist or imperialist co-optation
necessitates more]{.underline} [open interrogations of
power]{.underline} [and commitments to justice]{.underline}: and without
doubt IR, whether 'analytical' or 'critical', and academia more broadly,
are filled with sincere and honourable scholars who care about the world
they live in and have the capacity to enact positive
change. [Questioning and challenging accepted and expected modes of
academic enquiry requires courage and creativity, both of which are
aided through collective effort]{.underline}. This special issue, then,
is an invitation to adopt that courage and creativity in how we
cultivate knowledge, in questioning the purpose and the ends of that
knowledge, and to be discerning in how we try to put it into practice.

[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their **own
extinction**]{.underline}; [to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come]{.underline}. This
tendency is widely prevalent in English-language representations of
settler colonialism produced since the 1980s: [the possibility of an
ending -- the likelihood that the settler race will one day die out --
is a common theme]{.underline} in literary and pop culture
considerations of colonialism's future. Yet it has barely been remarked
how surprising it is that this theme is so present. [For
settlers]{.underline}, of all people, [to obsessively ruminate on their
own finitude is counterintuitive]{.underline}, for few modern social
formations have been more resistant to change than settler colonialism.
With a few exceptions (French Algeria being the largest), the settler
societies established in the last 300 years in the Americas,
Australasia, and Southern Africa have all retained the basic features
that define them as settler states -- namely, the structural privileging
of settlers at the expense of indigenous peoples, and the normalization
of whiteness as the marker of political agency and rights -- and they
have done so notwithstanding the sustained resistance that has been
mounted whenever such an order has been built. [Settlers think all the
time that they might one day end, even though (perhaps because) that
ending seems **unlikely** ever to happen.]{.underline} The significance
of this paradox for settler-colonial literature is the subject of this
article. [Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to
traditional analyses of settlercolonial narrative, which typically
examine settlers' attitudes towards history in order to highlight a
constitutive anxiety about the past -- about origins]{.underline}.
Settler colonialism, the argument goes, has a problem with historical
narration that arises from a contradiction in its founding mythology. In
Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler subject is by definition one
who comes from elsewhere but who strives to make this place home. The
settlement narrative must explain how this gap -- which is at once
geographical, historical, and existential -- has been bridged, and the
settler transformed from outsider into indigene. Yet the transformation
must remain constitutively incomplete, because the desire to be at home
necessarily invokes the spectre of the native, whose existence (which
cannot be disavowed completely because it is needed to define the
settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim to the land)
inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating the gap between
settler and colony that the narrative was meant to efface.1
[Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around its need to **erase**
and evoke **the native**, to make the indigene both invisible and
present in a contradictory pattern that prevents settlers from ever
moving on from the moment of colonization]{.underline}.2 As evidence of
this constitutive contradiction, [critics have identified in
settler-colonial discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as
disavowal, inversion, and repression]{.underline}.3 Indeed, the frozen
temporality of settler-colonial narrative, fixated on the moment of the
frontier, recalls nothing so much as Freud's description of the
'repetition compulsion' attending trauma.4 As Lorenzo Veracini puts it,
because: 'settler society' can thus be seen as a fantasy where a
perception of a constant struggle is juxtaposed against an ideal of
'peace' that can never be reached, settler projects embrace and reject
violence at the same time. The settler colonial situation is thus a
circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses produces
long-lasting psychic conflicts and a number of associated
psychopathologies.5 [Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on
settler-colonial narrative's view of the past,]{.underline} asking how
such a contradictory and troubled relationship to history might affect
present-day ideological formations. [Critics have rarely considered what
such narratological tensions might produce when the settler gaze is
turned to the future.]{.underline} [Few social formations are more
stubbornly resistant to change than settlement, suggesting that a future
beyond settler colonialism might be simply unthinkable]{.underline}.
Veracini, indeed, suggests that settler-colonial narrative can never
contemplate an ending: that settler decolonization is inconceivable
because settlers lack the metaphorical tools to imagine their own
demise.6 This article outlines why I partly disagree with that view. I
argue that [the narratological paradox that defines settler-colonial
narrative does make the future a problematic object of contemplation.
But that does not make settler decolonization unthinkable]{.underline}
per se; as I will show, [settlers do often try to imagine their demise
--]{.underline} [but they do so in a way that **reasserts the
paradoxes** of their founding ideology]{.underline}, with the result
that [the radical potentiality of decolonization is undone even as it is
invoked]{.underline}. I argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis,
[there is a metaphor via which the end of settler colonialism unspools
-- the]{.underline} quasi-biological [concept of extinction,
which]{.underline}, when deployed as a narrative trope, [offers settlers
a chance to consider and **disavow** their demise]{.underline}, [just as
they consider and then disavow the **violence of their
origins**.]{.underline} This article traces [the importance of the trope
of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial literature]{.underline},
with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and Australia. It explores
variations in how the death of settler colonialism is conceptualized,
drawing a distinction between historio-civilizational narratives of the
rise and fall of empires, and a species-oriented notion of extinction
that draws force from public anxiety about climate change -- an
invocation that adds another level of ambivalence by drawing on
['rational' fears for the future]{.underline} (because climate change
may well render the planet uninhabitable to humans) in order to
[narrativize a form of **social death** that, strictly speaking, belongs
to a different order of knowledge altogether.]{.underline} As such, [my
analysis is intended to draw the attention of settlercolonial studies
toward futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia]{.underline},
while highlighting a potential point of cross-fertilization between
settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.
[That 'extinction' should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon
is no surprise]{.underline}. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [settler
colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of elimination' that tends towards
the extermination]{.underline} -- by one means or another -- [of
indigenous peoples]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal
settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans
(1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the melancholia and
triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to the supposed
inevitability of indigenous extinction. Concepts like 'stadial
development' -- by which societies progress through stages,
progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and 'fatal impact' --
which names the biological inevitability of strong peoples supplanting
weak -- all contribute to the notion that settler colonialism is a kind
of 'ecological process' 9 that necessitates the extinction of inferior
races. [What is surprising, though,]{.underline} [is how often the trope
of extinction also appears with reference to settlers themselves; it
makes sense for settlers to narrate how their presence entails others'
destruction, but it is less clear why their attempts to imagine futures
should presume extinction to be their own logical end as
well]{.underline}. The idea appears repeatedly in English-language
literary treatments of settler colonialism. Consider, for instance, the
following rumination on the future of South African settler society,
from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm: It was one of
them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those pictures there.
He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make something, so he
made these. \[...\] Now the Boers have shot them all, so that we never
see a yellow face peeping out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild
bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone
soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at everything like they
look now.10 In this example, the narrating settler character, Waldo,
recognizes prior indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes
freighted with an expected sense of biological superiority, made
apparent by his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack
of mental self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation
of colonial genocide should turn immediately to the assumption that a
similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar presumption of racial
vulnerability permeates other late nineteenthcentury novels from the
imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of the Worlds, which are
plotted around the prospect of invasions that would see the extinction
of British imperialism, and, in the process, the human species. Such
[anxieties draw energy from a pattern of **settler defensiveness** that
can be observed across numerous settler-colonial contexts]{.underline}.
Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of the emergence of
transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical fact that [while
white male settlers have been arguably the most privileged class in
history, they have routinely perceived themselves to be 'under siege',
threatened with destruction to the extent that their very identity of
'whiteness was born in the apprehension of imminent
loss']{.underline}.11 [The fear of looming annihilation]{.underline}
[serves a powerful ideological function in settler communities, working
to **foster racial solidarity**, **suppress dissent**, and **legitimate
violence** against indigenous populations who]{.underline}, by any
objective measure, [are **far more at risk** of extermination than the
settlers who fear them]{.underline}. Ann Curthoys and Dirk Moses have
traced this pattern in Australia and Israel-Palestine, respectively.12
This scholarship suggests that [narratives of settler
extinction]{.underline} [are acts of **ideological mystification**,
obscuring the brutal inequalities of the frontier behind a mask of white
vulnerability]{.underline} -- an argument with which I sympathize.
However, this article shows how there is more to settler-colonial
extinction narratives than bad faith. I argue that we need a more
nuanced understanding of how they encode a specifically settler-colonial
framework for imagining the future, one that has implications for how we
understand contemporary literatures from settler societies, and which
allows us to see extinction as a genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage
social change. In the remainder of this paper I consider extinction's
function as a metaphor of decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke,
without completely endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argument that [to treat
decolonization figuratively, as]{.underline} I argue [extinction
narratives do, is necessarily to preclude radical change, **creating
opportunities** for settler 'moves to innocence' that re-legitimate
racial inequality]{.underline}.13 The counterview to this pessimistic
perspective is offered by Veracini, who suggests that progressive change
to settler-colonial relationships will only happen if narratives can be
found that make decolonization thinkable.14 This article enters the
debate between these two perspectives by asking what it means for
settler writers to imagine the future via the trope of extinction. Does
extinction offer a meaningful way to think about ending settler
colonialism, or does it re-activate settler-colonial patterns of thought
that allow exclusionary social structures to persist? I explore this
question with reference to examples of contemporary literary treatments
of extinction from select English-speaking settler-colonial contexts:
South Africa, Australia, and Canada.15 The next section of this article
traces key elements of extinction narrative in a range of
settler-colonial texts, while the section that follows offers a detailed
reading of one of the best examples of a sustained literary exploration
of human finitude, Margaret Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I
advance four specific arguments. First, extinction narratives take at
least two forms depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is
framed primarily in historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger,
biological sense; the key question is whether the 'thing' that is going
extinct is a society or a species. Second, biologically oriented
extinction narratives rely on a more or less conscious slippage between
'the settler' and 'the human'. Third, this slippage is ideologically
ambivalent: on the one hand, it contains a radical charge that invokes
environmentalist discourse and climate-change anxiety to imagine social
forms that re-write settler-colonial dynamics; on the other, it
replicates a core aspect of imperialist ideology by normalizing
whiteness as equivalent to humanity. Fourth, these ideological effects
are mediated by gender, insofar as extinction narratives invoke issues
of biological reproduction, community protection, and violence that
function to differentiate and reify masculine and feminine roles in the
putative de-colonial future. Overall, my central claim is that
[extinction is a core trope through which **settler futurity emerges**,
one with crucial narrative and ideological effects that shape much of
the contemporary literature emerging from white colonial
settings.]{.underline}

#### 'Extinction' is an [empty superlative]{.underline}. Forgo improbable impacts -- they re-entrench humanity into Western frames that manifest colonial genocide

\"Decolonizing against extinction part II: Extinction is not a
metaphor - it is literally genocide,\" September 27, 2017,
https://worldlyir.wordpress.com/category/extinction/)//SM

Extinction is not a metaphor... [Extinction has become an emblem of
Western, and white-dominated, fears about 'the end of **the(ir)**
world'.]{.underline} This scientific term is saturated with emotional
potency, stretched and contorted to embody almost any nightmare, from
climate change to asteroid strikes. In academic and public contexts
alike, it is regularly interchanged with other terms and concepts -- for
instance, 'species death', global warming or ecological collapse.
Diffused into sublime scales -- mass extinctions measured in millions of
(Gregorian calendar) years, a planet totalized by the threat of nuclear
destruction -- '[extinction' has become an **empty superlative**, one
that that gestures to an abstract form of unthinkability. It teases
Western subjects with images of generalized demise that might, if it
gets bad enough, even threaten us, or the figure of 'humanity' that we
enshrine as a universal.]{.underline} This figure of 'humanity', derived
from Western European enlightenment ideals, emphasizes individual,
autonomous actors who are fully integrated into the global market
system; who are responsible citizens of nation-states; who conform to
Western ideas of health and well-being; who partake of 'culture'; who
participate in democratic state-based politics; who refrain from
physical violence; and who manage their 'resources' responsibly
(Mitchell 2014). Oddly, [exposure to the fear of extinction contributes
to the formation and bolstering of contemporary Western subjects.
Contemplating the sublime destruction of 'humanity' offers the thrill of
abjection: the perverse pleasure derived from exposure to something by
which one is revolted.]{.underline} Claire Colebrook detects this
thrill-seeking impulse in the profusion of Western blockbuster films and
TV shows that imagine and envision the destruction of earth, or at least
of 'humanity'. It also throbs through a flurry of recent best-selling
books -- both fiction and speculative non-fiction (see Oreskes and
Conway 2014; Newitz 2013; Weisman 2008). In a forthcoming intervention,
Noah Theriault and I (2018) argue that these imaginaries are a form of
porn that normalizes the profound violences driving extinction, while
cocooning its viewers in the secure space of the voyeur. Certainly,
there are many Western scientists, conservationists and policy-makers
who are genuinely committed to stopping the extinction of others,
perhaps out of fear for their own futures. Yet [extinction is not quite
real for Western, and especially white, subjects; it is a **fantasy of
negation** that evokes thrill, melancholy, anger and existential
purpose. It is a metaphor that expresses the destructive desires of
these beings, and the negativity against which we define our
subjectivity. But **extinction is not a metaphor**: it is a very real
expression of violence that systematically destroys particular beings,
worlds, life forms and the relations that enable them to flourish. These
are real, unique beings, worlds and relations -- as well as somebody's
family, Ancestors, siblings, future generations -- who are violently
destroyed.]{.underline} Extinction can only be used unironically as a
metaphor by people who have never been threatened with it, told it is
their inevitable fate, or lost their relatives and Ancestors to it --
and who assume that they probably never will. This argument is directly
inspired by the call to arms issued in 2012 by Eve Tuck and Wayne K.
Yang and more recently by Cutcha Risling-Baldy. The first, seminal piece
demonstrates how settler cultures use the violence of metaphorical
abstraction to excuse themselves from the real work of decolonization:
ensuring that land and power is in Indigenous hands. Risling-Baldy's
brilliant follow-up extends this logic to explain how First People like
Coyote have been reduced to metaphors through settler appropriation. In
both cases, engagement with Indigenous peoples and their relations masks
moves to innocence: acts that make it appear as if settlers are engaging
in decolonization, while in fact we are consolidating the power
structures that privilege us. In this series, want to show how [Western,
and white-dominated, discourses on 'extinction' appear to address the
systematic destruction of peoples and other beings while enacting moves
to innocence that mask their culpability and **perpetuate structures of
violence**]{.underline}. As I argued in Part I of this series,
extinction is an expression of colonial violence. As such, it needs to
be addressed through direct decolonization, including the dismantling of
settler colonial structures of violence, and the resurgence of
Indigenous worlds. Following Tuck, Yang and Risling-Baldy's lead, I want
to show how and why the violences that drive extinction have come to be
invisible within mainstream discourses. Salient amongst these is the
practice of genocide against Indigenous peoples other than humans. ...it
is literally genocide. [What Western science calls 'extinction' is not
an unfortunate, unintended consequence of desirable 'human' activities.
It is an embodiment of particular patterns of structural violence that
disproportionately affect specific racialized groups.]{.underline} In
some cases, 'extinction' is directly, deliberately and systematically
inflicted in order to create space for aggressors, including settler
states. For this reason, [it has rightly been framed as an aspect or
tool of colonial genocides against Indigenous human
peoples.]{.underline} Indeed, many theorists have shown that the
'extirpation' of life forms (their total removal from a particular
place) is an instrument for enacting genocide upon Indigenous humans
(see Mazis 2008; Laduke 1999; Stannard 1994). Specifically, the removal
of key sources of food, clothing and other basic materials makes
survival on the land impossible for the people targeted. Nehiyaw thinker
Tasha Hubbard (2014) makes a qualitatively distinct argument. She points
out that the Buffalo are First People, the elder brothers of the Nehiyaw
people (and other Indigenous nations -- see Benton-Banai 2010). Starting
in the mid-1800s, the tens of millions of buffalo that ranged across
Turtle Island were nearly eliminated through strategic patterns of
killing carried out by settler-state-sponsored military and commercial
forces. Their killing was linked to governmental imperatives to clear
and territorially annex the Great Plains by removing its Indigenous
peoples. As Hubbard points out, methods of destroying buffalo herds
included large-scale killing, but also the disruption of their social
structures, the destruction of the ecosystems on which they rely, and
the removal of calves. These acts involve each of the components of the
definition of genocide enshrined in the UN Genocide Convention: (a)
Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm
to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group
conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in
whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births
within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to
another group. From Hubbard's viewpoint, rooted in Nehiyaw philosophy
and ethical-legal principles, the systematic destruction of the buffalo
is not like genocide, nor is it exclusively a tool for carrying out
genocide against human peoples. It is genocide in its own right: an
attempt to destroy a particular First People and the possibilities of
its continuity. In other words, the deliberate and systematic attempt to
eliminate the buffalo, enacted by settler states, simultaneously enacted
genocide against Indigenous peoples and their nonhuman relatives.
[Genocides of Indigenous peoples (human and otherwise) continue apace in
contemporary settler states, transformed into multiple
manifestations.]{.underline} For instance, they are integral to
'biosecurity' strategies designed to police the biological boundaries of
these states and their citizens. Laced with racializing and xenophobic
rhetoric (Subramaniam 2001), strategies such as culling or planned
eradications are intended to remove 'invasive' or 'foreign' life forms
in order to protect 'Native' ones. Many of the 'invasive' life forms
targeted for destruction were transported to unfamiliar lands through
colonial patterns of settlement and global trade flows. However, this
logic of elimination (Wolfe 2006) is often perverted, turned against
Indigenous\* beings whose flourishing impedes the expansion or
consolidation of the colonial state. For instance, Deborah Bird Rose
(2011 a, 2011 b) shows how this form of violence is continually waged
against flying foxes, who are framed by the settler state as "pest\[s\]
whose extinction is \[deliberately\] sought". This [act of elimination
involves explicit genocidal ideation, or the imagination of the
destruction of a people.]{.underline} Rose characterizes it as a "matter
of imagining a world without \[dingoes or flying foxes\], then setting
out to create it" (Rose 2011a). The Australian settler state has used
multiple tactics to induce terror and preclude flourishing amongst
flying foxes, from the emission of high-pitched electronic signals to
smearing trees with python excrement (Rose 2011b). Indeed, in 2014, I
lived near to the roosting site of a group of flying foxes in Turrbal
and Jagera Country (suburban Brisbane to settlers). Such nesting places
are called 'colonies' , reflecting a Western scientific rhetoric that
frames Indigenous peoples as 'invaders' of the settler state. The trees
that housed the nesting site backed onto a municipal facility, whose
fence had been covered with barbed wire, in which many of the bats
snared their wings and starved to death. This 'security' measure --
designed to protect the facilities relied upon by urban settlers from
the intrusion of flying foxes -- is a powerful weapon for precluding
ongoing flourishing of Indigenous other-than-human peoples. I learned
from neighbours that this 'colony' had previously been 'moved' from
several other sites around the city, suffering significant declines in
population each time. Indeed, despite reported declines of 95% in flying
fox communities in Queensland and neighbouring New South Wales, the
Queensland settler state legalized the shooting of the bats in 2012 by
fruitgrowers. Of course, in some cases, the elimination of life forms is
not as targeted or intentional -- it may take the form of land-based
extractive violence, the creep of ocean acidification, the decimation of
rainforests by climate change. Proponents of a Eurocentric definition of
genocide could argue that these events lack intention. Indeed, within
international law, intention to commit genocide is a necessary criteria
for conviction. However, theorists of critical genocide studies have
long argued that this definition is inadequate: it brackets out a great
many of the acts, logics and structures that produce the destruction of
unique peoples. According to Tony Barta, definitions of genocide that
focus on 'purposeful annihilation', and in particular on physical
killing, have "devalu\[ed\] all other concepts of less planned
destruction, even if the effects are the same" (Barta 2000, 238). For
this reason, he shifts the focus from 'genocidal intention' to
'genocidal outcome' -- that is, from the abstract assignation of
genocidal agency to the felt and embodied effects of eliminative
violence. It is the focus on intent, he contends, that allows white
Australians to imagine that their relationship with Aboriginal people is
non-genocidal despite overwhelming evidence of systematic and deliberate
racialized destruction over several centuries. In contrast, an approach
based on 'genocidal outcomes' makes it possible to account for complex
causality and weak intentionality -- that is, for myriad acts mediated
by subtle, normalized structures that, together, work to eliminate a
people. I want to argue that the same logic applies to nonhuman peoples:
the destruction of a life form, its relations with other beings and its
possible futures is a genocidal outcome, whether or not intention can be
identified. Similarly, Christopher Powell (2007) argues that, since a
'genos' is a "network of practical social relations, destruction of a
genos means the forcible breaking down of those relationships...these
effects could be produced without a coherent intent to destroy. They
could result from sporadic and uncoordinated actions whose underlying
connection is the production of a new society in which there is simply
no room for the genos in question to exist. They might even result from
well-meaning attempts to do good" (Powell 2007, 538) As I have argued
elsewhere, extinction is defined by the breaking of relations and the
systematic destruction of the conditions of plurality that nurture
co-flourishing worlds. Whether inflicted out as a deliberate act of
extirpation, or as the convergent effect of eliminative logics expressed
over centuries and enormous spatial scales, extinction is the
destruction of relations and the heterogenous societies they nurture.
Understood in this way, '[extinction' is not a metaphor for genocide or
other forms of large-scale violence: it is a **distinct manifestation of
genocide**]{.underline}. Masking the genocidal logics that drive
extinction involves several moves to innocence (Tuck and Yang 2012).
[Treating extinction as something short of genocide entrenches
Eurocentric understandings of personhood that are limited to homo
sapiens, **which is itself** an act of violence against these
peoples.]{.underline} Ironically, the entrenchment of this dichotomy
also enables the logic of 'dehumanization', in which human communities
are likened to reviled nonhumans (for instance, cockroaches) in order to
motivate violence against them. As I have argued elsewhere (Mitchell
2014), the logic of generalised 'dehumanisation' is uniquely effective
in Western frameworks in which the lack of ethical status for beings
other than humans removes obstacles to their mass destruction. Within
worlds in which human and nonhuman persons are linked through complex
systems of law, treaties, protocols and long-standing relations, this
claim is illogical. Within Western settler states, however, it functions
as a means of justifying ongoing violence against Indigenous peoples and
their relations. In addition, [by framing extinction as a problem for a
universal figure of 'humanity']{.underline} (more on this to follow...)
[mainstream discourses of extinction obscure its profound entwinement
with race and racializing structures.]{.underline} These examples make
it clear that [eliminative violence is targeted on specific groups of
people and their other-than-human relations, as defined by the
aggressors.]{.underline} Indeed, patterns of genocidal violence extend
racializing categories, hierarchies and eliminative impulses to
other-than-human peoples. Just as approaching gender violence separately
from race effaces their intersection, understanding extinction as
distinct from race is deeply misleading. This is not only because
racialized people are more likely to suffer from the effects of
'extinction' and other forms of environmental racism (which they are).
It is also because the eliminative violence that drives extinction
extend and enact race beyond the category of homo sapiens by defining
particular groups against white settler norms and as threats to the
settler society. To approach extinction separately from issues of race
is, therefore, to miss one of its most defining features.

At first glance, apocalyptic narratives seem to offer little in terms of
thinking the Anthropocene in anti-racist terms. However, as we
demonstrate here, this conclusion is premature. There are good reasons
for thinking that the apocalypse offers a fecund framework for
developing critical social theory in the face of climate catastrophe.
[Visions of apocalyptic futures have long been a means by which
subaltern groups have conceptualised the world. From the millenarian
peasant movements of early modern Europe to the rise of Rastafarianism
in the postcolonial Caribbean, accounts of the end of the world critique
the injustice of actually existing society and posit an emancipated
society in the future. More specifically, when thinking about the
relationship between the apocalypse, the Anthropocene and critical
social theory, there are compelling reasons to focus on the African
American theoretical and cultural tradition.]{.underline} The place of
apocalyptic narratives in African American thought is well known. Images
of the end of the world inflect the theology developed in the times of
slavery (Baker, 1990), the work of writers like Toni Morrison and James
Baldwin (Montgomery, 1996) and the music of Tupac and Public Enemy
(Ford, 2018). Furthermore, scholars like Kimberly Smith (2007), Dianne
Glave (2010) and Kimberly Ruffin (2010) have recuperated neglected
environmental tendencies in the African American tradition, drawing out
the way in which the experience of racial violence has fostered a
distinctive understanding of ecological questions. So, Black social
thought offers a promising resource for thinking the apocalypse and the
Anthropocene together in anti-racist terms. However, the apocalyptic
imaginaries and environmental concepts of Black thinkers are seldom
considered comparatively. Given this, what happens when Black apocalypse
and Black environmentalism are brought together? How does the confluence
of these two elements change the narratives of the end of the world
circulating in contemporary culture? In response to these questions,
this article argues that African American thinkers have reinvented
climate apocalypse in three ways. The first section examines the
revelatory function of apocalyptic narratives or the idea that they
disclose something fundamental about the social world[. By reading
Antebellum slave narratives that focus on the entwinement of racial
violence and environmental destruction in the post-apocalyptic
landscapes of the American South, we trace how the experience of chattel
slavery subverts and reforms the capacity of images of collapse to
reveal the hidden truth of contemporary society]{.underline}. The second
section turns to the association between the end of the world and
accounts of radical social transformation. We focus on W. E. B. Du
Bois's short story 'The Comet', which both exemplifies and questions the
millenarian undercurrent of apocalyptic narratives. Du Bois, by subtly
interweaving the past experience of slavery into a future tale of a
destroyed planet, suggests that even the end of the world may not spell
the end of the plantation system. In other words, the apocalypse, in and
of itself, has little transformative power; it will not bring rebirth or
renewal. Finally, the third section posits the apocalypse not as an
event to be endlessly deferred or fatalistically expected but instead
endured and escaped. By bringing together the modes of existence
developed in maroon communities of fugitive slaves with Octavia Butler's
account of a drought-stricken California in the near future, we suggest
that the cycle of catastrophes is to be weathered until such a time that
it can be blasted open. In the conclusion, we reflect on the
metaphorical form of utopianism associated with contemporary climate
marronage; escape can be evoked but not concretely imagined. Before
moving to this argument, a few preliminary points should be made. For
the purposes of this article, the African American theoretical and
cultural tradition refers to texts produced by enslaved peoples and
their descendants that address the effects of the Middle Passage and its
aftermath. Following Cornel West (2003, p. 11), we can thus define Black
social thought as 'the interpretation of Afro-American history,
highlighting the cultural heritage and political struggles, which
provides desirable norms that should regulate responses to particular
challenges presently confronting Afro-Americans'. So, when talking about
Black environmentalism, we mean accounts of ecological destruction that
foreground its relationship to the continuum of events beginning with
the Middle Passage and chattel slavery and running through to Jim Crow
segregation and mass incarceration. In a similar fashion, Black
apocalypse refers to visions in which mass devastation and societal
breakdown are grounded in this sequence of racialised oppression. Two
caveats should be added to this definition of Black social thought.
First, a great diversity of forms is examined in this article, including
slave narratives, post-apocalyptic fiction, hip hop and Afrofuturist
film. Prima facie, these modes of expression may appear at some distance
from the traditional forms of social theory (the essay, the article, the
monograph and so on). However, as indicated by West's reference to
cultural heritage, it would be wrong to exclude, in an a priori fashion,
certain forms of Black expression from the field of social theory. In
Barbara Christian's (1987, p. 52) words, Black 'theorizing \[...\] is
often in narrative forms, in the stories we create, in riddles and
proverbs, in the play with language, since dynamic rather than fixed
ideas seem more to our liking'. To do justice to the dynamism of Black
thought, the expansive approach adopted by this article is required.
Second, Black social thought is not monolithic or insular. Instead, as
Patricia Hill Collins (2002, p. 21) comments of Black feminism, it
'encompasses diverse and often contradictory meanings'. As we highlight,
there are internal differences in the Black theoretical and cultural
tradition, such that the meaning of the climate apocalypse for a
heterosexual Black man like Du Bois betrays forms of heteronormativity
and patriarchy. Furthermore, there are kinships between Black
environmentalism and the ecological thinking developed by other
oppressed groups, something highlighted by our mention of
Maroon-Amerindian formations in the conclusion. Plantation wastelands In
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the plantation system of the
American South faced increasingly serious environmental crises. The
export-driven commodity production of the Southern plantation, one node
in a network of global capitalism, relied on the exploitation of slave
labour and the intense cultivation of monocrops, such as tobacco and
cotton (Woods, 1998). The rift in 'the metabolic interaction between man
and the earth' that Karl Marx (\[1867\] 1976, p. 637) witnessed in
nineteenth-century England, where capitalistic agriculture resulted in
the degradation of previously fertile farmland (see Foster, 2020), and
that Amílcar Cabral (1988) pursued with his agronomy of liberation in
Western Africa in the 1950s (see César, 2018), also occurred in the
American South. [For example, over the course of the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries, the previously rich lands of Virginia and
Maryland were systematically depleted by tobacco, a crop notorious for
its mineral-draining power (Kulikoff, 2001). In more southerly states,
the cultivation of cotton had a similar effect, the ruthless
exploitation of the land pushing the South to 'the brink of an
ecological -- and thus an economic -- crisis']{.underline} by the
beginning of the Civil War (Maudlin, 2018, p. 12). The economics of
chattel slavery and settler colonialism, a seemingly endless supply of
stolen labour from Africa and stolen land from Indigenous peoples, meant
that there was very little incentive for planters to maintain the soil.
The planters were not 'landlords but "laborlords"', a 'geographically
rootless' class who exhausted one piece of the earth before moving their
enslaved workers to fresh land (Wright, 1986, p. 18). To borrow Saidiya
Hartman's (2007) term, one of the afterlives of slavery was a landscape
littered with the ghosts of the plantation. The planters, in sapping one
piece of land and then moving onto the next, produced a world punctuated
by abandoned buildings, empty fields and eroded soil. As Françoise
Vergès (2017, p. 73) notes more generally, the Southern system of
agriculture established a close connection 'between the Western
conception of nature as "cheap" and the global organization of a
"cheap", racialized, disposable workforce', the two bound together in
the footloose disposition of the planters. For enslaved peoples, the
unsustainable nature of this double disposability was clear. [While
masters and overseers 'strolled along the borders of the fields', the
slave labourers 'turned the soils, tended the plants, and harvested the
crops' and, in this way, 'acquired a firsthand knowledge of the
cultivated landscape on the plantation' (Stewart, 2006, p. 11). To use
Kathryn Yusoff's (2018, p. ii) words, the 'proximity of black and brown
bodies' to the soil produced a 'forced intimacy with the inhuman'. As a
consequence, a sense of kinship with the abused world of nonhuman nature
was fostered in African American culture.]{.underline} Such solidarity
can be seen in the sustainable agriculture practices developed on small
garden plots (Carney, 2021) and the affection for farmyard animals
voiced in some slave narratives and testimonies (Bennett, 2020). The
African American attentiveness to the travails of the natural world
translated into a concern for the ecological wreckages left by slavery,
something that is particularly evident in slave narratives of the
Antebellum period. For example, in the opening passage of Frederick
Douglass's My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he reflects on the
wasteland of his childhood home in Talbot County, Maryland. Douglass
(1855, p. 33) reports that the region is 'remarkable for nothing' except
the 'worn-out, sandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general
dilapidation of its farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless
character of its inhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever'. The
coming together of environmental degradation, architectural dilapidation
and human deprivation produces an image of a post-apocalyptic wasteland,
a world where some great force has swept through greedily sapping all
energy. [The unsustainability of the plantation system is revealed in
Douglass's narrative, the process of ravenously stripping the world of
resources, both human and nonhuman, steadily pushing the planter class
over an ecological cliff edge (]{.underline}Ellis, 2014). Charles Ball's
slave narrative Slavery in the United States (1837) reiterates
Douglass's image of a wasted planet denuded of life (Davis et al.,
2019). Ball (1837, pp. 47--48) describes Virginia and Maryland as lands
that had once been 'fertile and productive' but, after generations of
being exploited by tobacco planters, were now in a state of 'desolation
and poverty'. Abandoned by the former planters, who had taken their
enslaved labourers to new pastures, Ball (1837, p. 51) witnessed a world
defined by absence, desolation and death: This destructive crop
\[tobacco\] ruins the best land in a short time; \[...\] the traveller
will see large old family mansions of weather-beaten and neglected
appearance, standing in the middle of vast fields of many hundred acres,
the fences of which have rotted away. The 'folly and wickedness of
slavery' is written into the landscape of the American South; the
'aguish and sufferings' of the slave system are evident from the
topographical ruins it has produced (Ball, 1837, p. 49). Ball paints a
picture of a shattered world, in which the plantation system steadily
devours itself, each new crop cycle undermining the basis on which the
wealth and splendour of the masters was built. These slave narratives,
once read from the vantage point of the metabolic interaction between
human beings and the earth, contain a [warning. The post-apocalyptic
wastelands produced by the plantation system offer a foretaste of the
carbon-induced climate apocalypse of the contemporary moment. The fact
that the logic underpinning the plantation system has an affinity with
the one that propels contemporary climate devastation becomes clear in
the work of Ta-Nehisi Coates.]{.underline} At the end of Between the
World and Me (2015), a letter to his son, Coates draws out how the
instrumentalism of plantation slavery, a key component in the emergence
of the capitalist world system, has become a global force. Whereas
slavery was 'caged by technology and by the limits of horsepower and
wind', it helped lay the groundwork for 'the damming of seas for
voltage, the extraction of coal, the transmuting of oil into food'
(Coates, 2015, p. 150). The destructive ecological logics of the
contemporary world cannot be reduced to those developed on the
plantation, but the latter is one lens through which the consequences of
the former can be approached and comprehended. For Coates (2015, pp.
150--151), in a world where '\[p\]lunder has matured into habit and
addiction', where stolen labour and stolen land undergird an entire
social order, it is no surprise that the wastelands of slavery are
coming to haunt the globe as a whole: 'Something more fierce than Marcus
Garvey is riding on the whirlwind. [**Something more awful than all our
African ancestors is rising with the seas'.** In other words, the broken
bodies and ruined topographies of the past find an echo in the
catastrophes on the horizon; the plantation system continues to ravage
the earth, albeit in a ghostly, hidden fashion. In]{.underline} one
sense, Coates's invocation of plantation wastelands as a figure to
understand the climate catastrophe takes up one of the key functions of
apocalyptic narratives: revelation. The word apocalypse is derived from
the Greek term for unveiling and disclosing (apokálypsis), with part of
the function of apocalyptic visions to draw out 'aspects of the human
condition' previously hidden behind a 'protective screen' (Hall, 2009,
p. 3). The revelatory function of the apocalypse becomes particularly
significant in the context of the climate crisis. Ecologically
destructive everyday practices -- meat consumption, the ownership of
private cars, frequent air travel and so on -- have become normalised in
the Global North, but their consequences are masked (Browne, 2018).
While climate denialism has been largely discredited, this does not mean
that the effects of these practices are transparent. In Ulrich Brand and
Markus Wissen's (2021, p. 5) words, an environmentally unsustainable
mode of life has successfully hidden 'the destruction in which it is
rooted' through the 'externalization of material, social and ecological
costs'. This externalisation process takes place both geographically,
with the most toxic forms of industry and violent modes of extraction
located in the Global South, and temporally, with actions in the present
having their most destructive effects in the future. [Visions of
post-apocalyptic plantations draw out the inner destructiveness of the
dominant tendencies of the contemporary moment, using an image from the
past to highlight that ecological consequences cannot be forever
externalised. Accounts of a world ravaged by the twin disposability of
human and nonhuman nature illuminate the telos of the current social
order. The planet's climate system is about 'to punish us with all the
ferocity we have fed it', the latent ecological violence of racial
capitalism on the cusp of breaking out into the open (Wallace-Wells,
2019, p. 211). To some degree, the slave narratives of the nineteenth
century fulfil the revelatory function of climate
apocalypse.]{.underline} The ultimate truth of our world has already
been witnessed on the desolate and abandoned farmlands of Virginia and
Maryland. Yet, there is a note of scepticism in these African American
accounts about revelation. Coates's neoslave narrative The Water Dancer
(2019), which focuses on a failing tobacco plantation in the nineteenth
century, is interesting in this context. The neoslave narrative, a genre
that revives and reworks the Antebellum slave narrative, emerged in the
1980s in the aftermath of the disappointment of the Civil Rights
movement as a means of grappling with the continuities in the African
American experience (Rushdy, 1999). Continuing this tradition, The Water
Dancer reflects on how, despite the profound changes between the
nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, plantation wastelands retain a
hold in the time of climate catastrophe. On the one hand, the forced
intimacy with the land means that, for enslaved people and their
ancestors, there is nothing secret or hidden about the destructiveness
of the plantation system. African American labourers 'knew what the land
whispered, because none lived closer to the land than those who worked
it' (Coates, 2019, p. 236). [On the other hand, the revelations of the
climate apocalypse have failed to break the central illusion of the
plantation system: that labour and land can be exploited without
consequence. The planter class, and white society more generally, are
'lost in dreams', unable to imagine a mode of life in which the
metabolic interaction between humanity and the earth is reconstituted on
a new basis (Coates, 2019, p. 653). From the perspective of white
supremacy and racial capitalism, the apocalypse is an impossibility,
such that the post-apocalyptic landscapes of the plantation fail to
pique a sense of recognition or concern.]{.underline} The scepticism
about the revelatory function of apocalypse stems from the peculiar
temporality of Black apocalyptic narratives. In N. K. Jemisin's words,
it is 'the apocalypse again and again and again', each new wave of
racial violence and environmental destruction reprising and replaying
the catastrophic coming together of cheap nature and cheap labour in the
plantation system (Hurley & Jemisin, 2018, p. 472). The recursive,
cyclical nature of the apocalypse means that, for African Americans, the
end of the world has given everything that it has to give and any hope
that images of ecologically devastated landscapes will inspire a
transformation in white consciousness has long been extinguished. [Those
who failed to be moved by images of vanquished plantations in the past
will not be pushed to action by visions of the catastrophes on the
horizon. The impending climate catastrophe does not represent a
fundamentally novel scenario. Instead, the apocalypse on the horizon in
the twenty-first century recalls and recharges the rifts that have
enveloped the planet since the Middle Passage. The revelatory power of
the apocalypse is exhausted, each new return to catastrophe confirming
the impotence of the figure of the end of the world.]{.underline}

[Black journalism directed toward Black readers was a crucial part of
Ida B. Wells' writing]{.underline}. She is a key figure in the
discussion of Black journalism, its directive, and its popularization
amongst Black readers specifically. She wanted her writing to be
accessible to Black audiences: \"I wrote in a plain common-sense way on
the things which concerned our people. Knowing that their education was
limited, I never used a word of two syllables where one would serve the
purpose.\" Her [writing was widely circulated and read by Black
audiences because the white press (mainstream press) didn't see Black
people as an audience]{.underline}. [So, for the most part, the \"white
press ignored Black people unless they were committing crimes or being
lynched,\" which further demonstrates how the press continued to shape
**the narrative around lynching and manipulate the public's perception
of anti-black violence, contributing to its
normalization**.]{.underline} [Ida B. Wells\'s investigative journalism
was a vital part of documenting lynching in an era when government
officials were not only complicit in lynching but also the fact that the
practice was severely under-reported]{.underline}. Her journalism also
worked with modern innovations, especially the use of statistics. Wells,
in her own investigation, created what we would refer to today as
spreadsheets to document lynchings. She would then \"aggregate all the
cases of lynchings that she could find in the newspapers\" and compare
that to the data that she collected.105 Her research ultimately showed
that the narrative of Black men as predators of white women, which
circulated in white newspapers, was a false justification for lynching.
[Wells' personal experience with lynching also revealed that this was a
lie, that lynching was white terrorism.]{.underline}

Southern Horrors investigated 728 lynchings in the South. Through her
investigative research, Wells found that only a third of lynching
victims had been charged with rape, \"to say nothing of those of that
one-third who were innocent of the charge.\"107 Southern horrors also
revealed the refusal of white people to hold white rapists accountable
for the crimes that she investigated related to the rapes, murders, and
lynchings of Black women and girls. Ida B. Wells broke boundaries with
her journalism because she was the only person discussing rape and
interracial sexuality during this period.108 [Ida B. Wells was a
controversial investigative journalist because of the subject matter,
but ultimately a pioneer that must be included in discussions of the
circulation of Black journalism. In her newspaper articles, she would
often call for Black people to boycott racist institutions and stores,
and after the lynchings of her friends, for Black people to abandon the
city of Memphis.]{.underline} She was further determined to abandon
Memphis after a white mob destroyed her newspaper office and threatened
to kill her.109 Ida B. Wells relocated to Chicago for her own safety,
but she continued to protest injustice and write. She published A Red
Record. Tabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynchings in the
United States, 1892-1893-1894 making the argument that the resurgence of
white mob violence was directly related to Black people gaining
positions of power. [Black press for Black people has always been a site
of protest and activism, and as we move into digital modes of journalism
in the present, we can begin to articulate a connection between the two
while also observing the limitations of agency in Black digital
enclaves.]{.underline}

[The Black press is also connected to postmemory, both emerging as a
response to white supremacist violence and terrorism. It is an
unfortunate reality of the Black experience to live under the constant
threat of racial violence, which has been carefully documented and
committed to memory by Black people. Postmemory is crucial in navigating
and interpreting these moments of violence, while it also functions as a
tool to critique and respond to that violence.]{.underline} [It \"makes
visible what has been obscured, what has been forgotten by white media
and their specific renderings of history]{.underline}\"110: [Critical
black memory emerges out of and is motivated by both survival---the
continued ability to struggle and the faith that such struggle will
secure a brighter future---and failure---the persistence of peril and
renewed forms of racial inequity and subjugation. On the one hand,
memory offers a space to organize for the future while making a critical
assessment of the past and present]{.underline}.

For African Americans, in particular, who have traditionally been denied
access to formal historical institutions, memory has been more than a
mere repository of experience. [Postmemory]{.underline} has challenged
official stories and given voice to historical silences. It has
attempted to suture continuity in the face of rupture and fragmentation.
It [has proffered futurity]{.underline} woven [out of]{.underline} the
ineffable terror of [the past. The importance of postmemory is that it
also provides a space for the Black community to organize and learn from
these inevitable and connected instances of violence.]{.underline}
Despite the shared reality that Black life exists under the continued
threat of racially inflicted violence, [it has also produced a culture
of communal mourning for Black people.]{.underline} A pivotal moment
within postmemory that marks a moment of communal mourning is the murder
and public funeral of Emmett Till. [Images from that funeral were
printed and circulated around the world, revealing what white men did to
Black children in the American south.]{.underline}

In 1955 both John H. Johnson's Jet magazine and Robert Abbot's The
Chicago Defender printed the infamous image of Emmett Till's brutalized
face in his casket. [Black journalism was essential in informing
critical masses of Black people about the violence that Till had
succumbed to, the pain that led Mamie Till Mobley to \"let the people
see what they had done . . .\" and, ultimately, the not guilty
verdict.]{.underline} While white media outlets did a report on the
trial of Emmett Till's murderers, it was solely the Black press at the
time that printed and circulated the photos of Emmett Till from his
public funeral in Chicago. [Emmett Till's murder marks a crucial moment
in the history of image circulation]{.underline}. It was the first issue
of Jet magazine that had necessitated a reprint, marking a moment in
which Till's photo and story had gone proto-viral. The historian Elliot
J. Gorn discusses censorship in mainstream media and their refusal to
show the image in newspapers and on the news.

[The Chicago Defender and Jet shared the images because they presented
the painful reality of American racism. They were fulfilling their duty
to the Black community and respecting the wishes of Mamie Till Mobley to
bear witness and to transform their readers into witnesses as
well.]{.underline} [Black journalism was how the Black community
accessed the truth]{.underline}.117 While seventy-seven percent of
American households owned a television at the time, Black journalism was
the primary mode of dissemination of Emmett Till's story and primarily
aided in the circulation of the image of his face. Print media was
accessible, affordable, and easily shared. It could be read aloud in
schools, and it could be further shared and spread via word of mouth.
[The news of Emmett Till's death spread throughout Black communities,
and his story ultimately galvanized Black people to take action and join
the Civil Rights Movement.]{.underline} [His story made their worst
fears tangible; that this could happen to their children, to their loved
ones, and they would be powerless.]{.underline} However, the refusal of
the press to share the images (within the South specifically) was in
response to Mamie Till Mobley\'s decision to share these images of her
son. The white south was infuriated, and they lashed out using the
press.

Communications scholar Davis Houck mapped out the crucial role of the
press in the exoneration of Till's murderers. The first five days after
the trial, the local press was sympathetic, and a local paper stated
that Emmett Till's murder \"dealt the reputation of the South and
Mississippi a savage blow.\" The press was strategic in its
representation of the defendants and of Carolyn Bryant, who was pictured
in a beauty pageant photo. Her husband, Roy Bryant, and his accomplice,
J.W. Millam, were pictured in their military uniforms, further pushing a
visual narrative that they were upstanding, law-abiding citizens and
incapable of committing such a crime. In contradistinction, Emmett Till
was represented as a \"large\" and \"husky\" arrogant young man from the
North. The Delta Democratic Times chastised the NAACP, as well as the
\"friends\" and family of Emmett Till.

The Democratic Times was considered a moderate paper, and their
journalism heavily influenced the local white population, so much so
that three key witnesses in the trial fled the state of Mississippi.120
[The press had immense power when it came to shaping public perception
of the trial, but it wasn't simply their words that wielded all of the
power.]{.underline} The optics of Bryant and Millam as men who had
served America and the dissemination of this narrative were used to
manipulate and distort the public's perception of Emmett Till.121 [The
process by which the white press invoked a historic myth speaks to the
convoluted path that Black people have too often faced in instances of
state and extrajudicial violence.]{.underline} At first appearance,
these racialized myths are presented as \"natural,\" as having always
existed, despite the fact that they are used to present a historical
intention as a natural justification or \"making contingency appear
eternal.\"122 This justification for Till's death in the Southern press
further contributes to the distorted perception of Black people and, in
this context, Black men (and boys). [The white press created a
reactionary backlash against the photo of Emmett Till as an attempt to
neutralize the truth that Emmett Till's photo told. This separation in
the way that the press decided to report on Emmett Till's
kidnapping/murder and the subsequent trial and acquittal further
positioned Black journalism as a site of real truth by and for the Black
community.]{.underline}

### AT: Psychoanalysis non-falsifiable

#### Falsifiability is a bad frame developed to intentionally exclude and refuse to engage theories which western scientists considered unworthy, like post-colonialism.

[The successful use of controlled experiments in science to corroborate
or falsify hypotheses has led many to consider this testing process as
the defining characteristic of scientific inquiry.]{.underline} Sir Karl
[Popper articulated this]{.underline} criterion [when trying to find a
way to distinguish apparent pseudosciences such as Freudianism and
Marxism]{.underline} from genuine science. [Popper asserted]{.underline}
that [a truly scientific theory must be "falsifiable,"]{.underline} that
is to say, it can be subjected to a controlled experiment that could
conceivably contradict it. Conversely, [any theory]{.underline} that
does [not]{.underline} admit the possibility of [empirical falsification
is regarded as pseudoscience.]{.underline}

The falsifiability standard has attained widespread acceptance among
scientists, though [philosophers of science have pointed out several
problems with such a definition of scientific method.]{.underline}

First, the [falsifiability]{.underline} standard [was]{.underline}
[**chosen by Popper deliberately to exclude theories he intuitively
judged unscientific, so it** possibly]{.underline} [**contains**
more]{.underline} **[cultural bias]{.underline}** [than an objective
theory of knowledge should]{.underline}. Second**[, it is not clear that
this standard includes or excludes the theories that Popper
intended]{.underline}**. Some Marxists and Freudians are quite amenable
to refutation by experiment, while [some mathematical theories of
physics deal with particle interactions that are fundamentally
unobservable]{.underline}. Moreover, [Popper's definition might be
interpreted to exclude mathematics and many of the social
sciences]{.underline}, particularly those studying the unrepeatable
past. [Falsifiability might be a good standard for empirical natural
science, but not science in the broader, classical sense of the
term.]{.underline}

So-called pseudosciences such as Freudianism, Marxism, and astrology do
not meet the falsifiability standard, to the extent that their defenders
resort to special pleading to explain away failed predictions, rather
than admit a failure of their theory. This seems to make the scientific
or pseudoscientific status of a theory depend more on the behavior of
its adherents than on any intrinsic characteristic of the theory as
such.

[Tautological knowledge]{.underline}, which may be deduced by
philosophers and mathematicians, **[would seem to be inherently
unfalsifiable.]{.underline}** This exclusion reminds us that [a theory
of empirical science can never serve as a general theory of knowledge,
as there are other possible paths to knowledge.]{.underline} Thus
pseudosciences that do not meet the falsifiability standard are not
thereby discredited in the least. All that is proven is that they are
not empirical sciences of nature, but neither are mathematics and
philosophy, and that is not to their discredit.

The [falsifiability]{.underline} standard [counterintuitively suggests
that the credibility of a scientific theory is derived from the
possibility of it being wrong.]{.underline} It is [more
accurate]{.underline} to assert that [a scientific theory gains
credibility from its *verifiability*]{.underline}, by successfully
[passing tests]{.underline} where it might have been proven wrong. What
is paramount is that a theory is consistent with observation, and this
has been the hallmark of physical science for the last three centuries,
without explicit reference to a falsifiability standard. [As long as a
theory is confirmed]{.underline} by controlled experiment, the
hypothetical [possibility of a negative result is of secondary
importance]{.underline}.

Equally counterintuitive is the implication that a theory lacking
falsifiability loses credibility. Intuitively, [if a proposition is
absolutely not falsifiable, it is certainly true]{.underline}, though it
may be merely a tautology. Regarding pseudosciences as non-falsifiable
gives them too much credit, when in fact their excuses for failed
predictions can be refuted by evidence and argument. All too often the
[falsifiability]{.underline} standard is used as **[an excuse to refuse
to engage a theory]{.underline}**, maintaining that its exponents will
not accept any refutation.

Since falsifiability really means being *empirically* falsifiable, and
the empirical is restricted to physical observation, Popper's theory
furtively incorporates philosophical materialism into his theory of
science, which is then misused as a general theory of knowledge. With
one stroke, any sort of metaphysical, religious, or spiritual
speculation is dismissed as not meriting credibility. Rather than be
forced to honestly engage metaphysical arguments with counterarguments,
we are excused from debating them altogether, as if they were beyond
reason. Clearly, this position is unwarranted, and it arises from the
error of equating non-empiricism with irrationality.

### AT: Extinction Outweighs/Util

#### Utilitarian calculations of risk are [unethical]{.underline} and justify [existentially genocidal violence]{.underline}.

**Oliver, 23**---Department of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University (Kelly,
"The Limits and Dangers of Risk-Benefit Analysis: From the Refugee
Crisis to the Coronavirus Pandemic," *The Vulnerability of the Human
World: Well-being, Health, Technology and the Environment*, Chapter 2,
pp. 13--27, SpringerLink, dml)

In Carceral Humanitarianism (2017), I argue against [utilitarian
risk-benefit calculations]{.underline} as a principle of ethics. There,
I argue that the utilitarian calculus used by both humanitarian aid
organizations and so-called humanitarian military operations (with its
surgical strikes and statistical modelling) [**reduces** human life to
**statistical calculations** of risk or benefit]{.underline}---and
**[not]{.underline}** just risk or benefit [in the
**absolute**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather risk or benefit as
defined by the organization or government doing the calculations. Risks
and benefits are [**always** defined with certain goals in
mind]{.underline}. [They are **never** without context]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} therefore [purely]{.underline}
"**[objective]{.underline}**" [or **free** from]{.underline} politics or
**[bias]{.underline}**. Thus, any utilitarian calculus assumes some good
or goal beyond calculation such as pain or pleasure, suffering or
quality of life. [Even **survival**]{.underline}---life and death---[are
valued relative to particular goals that **defy** the calculations of
risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. In other words, employing
risk-benefit and utilitarian calculations, requires making assumptions
about end goals and values that defy those very calculations. It is not
just that [there are **always** factors beyond our control and variables
we **do not know**]{.underline}, as the deadly coronavirus makes
painfully clear, but also that risk-benefit and [utilitarian
calculations do not operate in a **vacuum** but **necessarily** make
assumptions about the good]{.underline}.

In the West, risk-benefit analysis or [utilitarian calculative
reasoning]{.underline} has become the dominant mode of addressing social
issues, economic issues, and health issues. For example, Doctors without
Borders uses complex risk-benefit computer modeling to set policies
about where to send medical aid (Neuman, 2016).Footnote 9 And too many
hospitals dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic have had to resort to
triage medicine that uses risk-benefit analysis to distribute scarce
resources such as ICU beds, oxygen, and ventilators.

This type of calculative reasoning, however, [treats human life as
**fungible** and **exchangeable**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
thereby [makes acceptable]{.underline} so-called [**collateral damage**
and **death**]{.underline}. The way risk-benefit analysis is used to
calculate acceptable collateral damage in warfare is a prime example of
the costs of calculable reason, where utilitarian arguments are used to
justify acceptable levels of killing and death. [The calculating machine
at the heart of utilitarian risk-benefit analysis is **dangerous** when
it makes individual lives fungible and exchangeable]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} approach [**does not** and **cannot** address the
**singularity** of each living being]{.underline}.

Both humanitarian aid and "humanitarian" warfare operate according to
logics of calculation. In fact, humanitarian warfare and humanitarian
aid operate in tandem. In a sense, nation states create refugees by
limiting citizenship, and then pay humanitarian aid organizations to
take care of them. National sovereignty and its concomitant notion of
citizenship are dependent upon so-called neutral humanitarian space,
which occupies an ambiguous space on the outskirts, and borders of, host
countries. Refugees are detained in camps and detention centers at the
borders in supposedly neutral humanitarian space free from politics and
war. Yet, this neutral humanitarian space, often guarded by state police
and military, is far from independent of state sovereignty.

To the contrary, humanitarian space is coopted to maintain national
sovereignty against the so-called threat of migrants, asylum seekers,
and refugees. In other words, within carceral humanitarianism, refugees
operate as both a threat to national sovereignty, and the justification
for shoring up borders.

The fact that the United States and the European Union pay other
countries to keep refugees from crossing into their borders makes clear
that the lives of these people can be bought and sold like so much cargo
to be held in port or lost at sea. For example, the recent crisis in
Belarus at the Polish border, where, according to migrants and refugees
are being used as political pawns. According to the New York Times:
"Europe has long paid other nations to keep refugees away from its
borders... This gives countries on the European periphery the leverage,
and incentive, to use those refugees as pawns" (see Fisher,
2021).Footnote 10

Policies that treat refugees as collateral damage or units of exchange,
where some lives are more valuable than others as calculated through
risk-benefit analysis, renders the lives of refugees fungible, and
therefore, ultimately, disposable.

Statistical models that compute [comparative valuations set out a
**hierarchy** of life]{.underline}, human and otherwise, [through which
violence is **justified**]{.underline}, [and some lives are
**valuable**]{.underline} (in this case, citizens), [while others are
**disposable**]{.underline} (in this case, refugees). Yet, [in **any**
risk-benefit or utilitarian calculation]{.underline}, [there is
**always** a remainder that **cannot be calculated**]{.underline}---not
just in the arithmetic sense, but also [a remainder beyond calculation
and beyond recognition]{.underline}.

[There is always something we **don't know** that is **necessarily left
out** of any calculation]{.underline}. [We are **not masters** of the
world and therefore there are always factors **beyond** our knowledge
and control]{.underline}. In addition, there are elements beyond our
comprehension. [It is **not**]{.underline}, then, [just a matter of
**gathering all the relevant data**]{.underline}, and that fact that we
always fall short. [There are elements that affect our calculations that
we **aren't even aware of**]{.underline}, [that we **can never
know**]{.underline}. [There will always be something **outside our
comprehension affecting our calculations**]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[human experience]{.underline}, and the experience of life itself,
[**cannot be reduced** to calculations or exchangeable
units]{.underline}. [There is always something about life that
**transcends** even the most sophisticated mathematical
calculations]{.underline}. We might call this the remainder left over
when we attempt to translate ethics into politics or the singular into
the universal. There is always something about the singularity of each
living being that cannot be reduced to any system of exchange value.

2.3 Justice Between Ethics and Politics

Justice requires continually renegotiating the relationship between
ethics and politics, singular and universal, precisely because there is
always something in excess, something beyond recognition.
[This]{.underline} remainder [is the **ethical imperative** that should
**keep us awake at night**]{.underline}. [Rather than lead to
**inquietude** or **apathy**]{.underline}, the excess beyond our
[recognition keeps us **actively searching** for better ways to approach
justice **without** resting on]{.underline} moral rules or [risk-benefit
calculations]{.underline} or self-righteous principles. The remainder
beyond calculation, beyond recognition, demands that we continue to
question our own principles and policies, that we continue to examine
our concepts of justice and fairness and equality.

An [ethical politics]{.underline} is one in which justice demands the
hyper-vigilance self-critical reflection on where any response---ethical
or political---necessarily falls short. It is an ongoing task that
[**cannot end** with risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. [Despite the
**ethical insomnia** and **political vertigo** caused by this
interminable self-questioning]{.underline}, [we must
**act**]{.underline}---[even **leap**]{.underline}. Although ultimately
the gap between singularity and universality is impassible, [the
impossibility of achieving justice is **no excuse** for not **attempting
it every single day**]{.underline}.

This tension between politics (which addresses itself to what can be
seen, and to the universal, what can be shared), and ethics (which
addressed itself to what cannot be seen, and to the singular, what
cannot be shared) is the knot at the center of justice.

[Justice is **antithetical** to utilitarian ethics insofar as
individuals are **not fungible units** that can be
exchanged]{.underline}. [Utilitarianism relies on the **calculability**
of]{.underline} pain, suffering, **[survival]{.underline}**, [or the
quality of life]{.underline} itself. And the [utilitarian calculus
relies on determining **thresholds** that separate individuals into
groups]{.underline}, whether it is those who are members of the moral
community or the polis, and those who are not (for example animals), or
those [whose lives are **worth saving** and those whose lives are
**not**]{.underline}.

At some point, however, [this type of line-drawing **inevitably**
becomes either **political** or **arbitrary**]{.underline}. Take debates
over the basis for membership in the moral community. What are the
criteria for membership? Intelligence, language, reason, sentience, the
ability to suffer? And [whatever we decide should be the
criteria]{.underline}, [where do we **draw the line**?]{.underline} For
example, what counts as a language? Does the bees signal dance count?
Or, as some argue, is it merely a code and not a language? What counts
as intelligence? Peter Singer argues that great apes should be extended
rights or admitted to the moral community based on their intelligence,
which is greater than severely mentally disabled persons (see Singer,
1999; McMahan, 2009; Anstötz, 1993).Footnote 11 Some disability scholars
such as Eva Kittay have argued against this comparison, insisting that
human beings should be accorded special status regardless of their
mental abilities (Kittay, 1998a, b, 2009).Footnote 12 The controversy
over Singer's argument demonstrates how [utilitarian line-drawing is
always a **fraught endeavor** that ultimately rests on an **arbitrary
cut off point**]{.underline}.

For example, in Animal Liberation, Singer draws the line between calms
and shellfish, who supposedly cannot feel pain (Singer, 1990,
173--4).Footnote 13 But what if we learn that shellfish can feel pain?
In all these utilitarian endeavors, the liminal cases are unsettling
because they reveal the arbitrariness of borders and the inadequacy of
general classifications. This type of line-drawing or threshold not only
ignores the singularity of each individual, but also poses an arbitrary
or political dividing line as a natural border. The same is true of
national borders used to keep migrants out.

We see something similar in covid triage medicine where triage protocols
disadvantage whole classes of people. Old people, disabled people,
cancer survivors. The coronavirus lays bare the fantasy of calculable
criteria as an ethical way of life. Covid reveals gaping inequities in
the length and quality of life caused by social and economic
"pre-existing conditions." Celebrities and politicians from Madonna to
Andrew Cuomo called the coronavirus the "great equalizer." In March
2020, Cuomo tweeted "This virus is the great equalizer." In reality,
covid is the great unequalizer... Footnote 14

The pandemic forces doctors and nurses to make impossible decisions
about who is given the chance to live and who will die. But these
decisions exist in the context of pre-existing conditions of poverty,
racism, and unequal access to health care that skew any attempt at fair
or reasonable calculation. In a fair and just world, there would be
adequate resources available to everyone. Tragically, the real world is
not so fair or just. And [risk-benefit analysis and calculative
reasoning become the justification for **allowing some to
die**]{.underline}. [When those calculations pose as **justice** or
**fairness**]{.underline}, [and when they allow us to feel
**certain**]{.underline}, even righteous, [in our
**decisions**]{.underline}, then [they risk a **slippery slope** that
leads us to a place where **any** and **all life** can become
**disposable**]{.underline}.

The pandemic has made painfully clear the limitations of risk-benefit
analysis and calculative reasoning. Doctors and nurses report being
traumatized when forced to decide who will get life saving resources.
Face-to-face with patients, risk-benefit calculations are not as
straight forward as the mathematical or statistical modelling suggests.

A group of research physicians at the University of California,
describes the problem:

[Utilitarian approaches]{.underline} to ethical problems [often
**appear** to be **more practical** than many alternatives]{.underline}:
[we can **know** what the right course of action is by calculating
whichever choice will produce the **greatest good** for the **greatest
number**]{.underline}. Part of the appeal of utilitarian ethics is that
it seems like it should "work." [In the **real world**]{.underline},
however, [performing the relevant calculations can be **far from
easy**]{.underline}. This is especially true in crisis situations. [It
may be **impossible** to collect the **data** needed]{.underline} as
input for the calculations, it may be difficult or impossible [to create
the **decision rules**]{.underline} (predicting prognosis or comparing
outcomes) that constitute the calculations, [the calculator may be
**impaired** by any number of different factors]{.underline} (moral
distress, fatigue, internal and external pressures, etc.) [or
**non-utilitarian moral constraints**]{.underline} (such as superseding
egalitarian policies, or even exponentially increasing crisis severity)
[can make utilitarian approaches **infeasible**]{.underline}. (Fedyk et
al., 2020)Footnote 15

2.4 The "Lessor of Evils"

[Rather than an ethical solution]{.underline}, [utilitarian risk-benefit
analysis]{.underline} in a triage medicine [is a]{.underline}
"**[lesser]{.underline}** of the **[evils]{.underline}**"
[approach]{.underline}. In fact, as I discovered doing research for
Carceral Humanitarianism, when discussing both humanitarian aid and
warfare, experts described risk-benefit and collateral damage
calculations as the "lessor of the evils" (Oliver, 2017). Some even see
these policies of assessing collateral damage as preventing the worst
evil by preventing massacre, genocide, and mass death. But as Hannah
Arendt reminds us, "[Those who choose the lesser evil **forget very
quickly** that they **still chose evil**]{.underline}" (Arendt, 2003,
30).Footnote 16

In Carceral Humanitarianism, I consider the question of "the worst"
violence. There, I argue that contemporary logics of proportionality
employed by both humanitarian aid organization and humanitarian military
operations are designed to mitigate and control violence and death to
avoid the worst violence and death, according to calculations of the
"lessor of evils." Thus, [we must ask what is the]{.underline} "most
evil," or the [**worst** evil]{.underline}. We may think of genocide as
the worst evil, and, in the West, "the worst" is often shorthand for the
"final solution" and the Holocaust. Since the end of World War II, and
the Cold War, "[the **worst**]{.underline}" [has become associated
with]{.underline} the possibility of nuclear war, even [the destruction
of the **entire planet**]{.underline}.

[What if the worst is a result of the **logic of calculation** taken to
the **extreme** at the expense of **all other worldviews**?]{.underline}
[What if the worst is when this calculable way of thinking is used to
justify **massacre**]{.underline}, **[genocide]{.underline}**, [and
**mass death**?]{.underline} [When lives become
**fungible**]{.underline} and exchange, then [we risk]{.underline} "[the
**worst**]{.underline}." Insofar as contemporary so-called
"humanitarian" warfare operates according to the logic of utilitarian
calculations of collateral damage that make some lives disposable, it
too risks "the worst."

[The worst goes **beyond literal killing** and signals the
**erasure**]{.underline} a way [of]{.underline} seeing the world---or we
might as well say [a **world itself**]{.underline}---[by **covering it
over** with another worldview]{.underline}. In this regard, [comparative
models that **reduce** life to units to be **exchanged** or **plugged
into equations** operate according to a **world-destroying genocidal
logic**]{.underline}. This is to say, when "the worst" becomes part of
the economy of "lessor of evils," life and death are reduced to a logic
of calculation that makes them fungible; one life is weighed against
another. Which is the lesser evil: One thousand four hundred and
twenty-two refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea in 2020 or the
cost to citizens of the European Union of providing safe passage to
refugees? Which is the lesser evil: killing one civilian infant or
killing three soldiers in a surgical strike? Which is the lessor evil: a
50-year-old diabetic and mother of two with covid dying because she
doesn't have access to a ventilator, or a widowed and otherwise healthy
70-year-old man dying without access to a ventilator? Etc. Etc.

What is an acceptable death? The death as collateral damage? [To be
**calculable**]{.underline}, [each life must be **reducible** to a
common denominator and **exchangeable**]{.underline}. [Each life becomes
a unit in an equation]{.underline}, a risk factor.

Yet, as the examples I just mentioned suggest, [these decisions as to
which is **worse**]{.underline}---[or which is the **lesser** of the
evils]{.underline}---[are **always** made by **privileging one context**
over another]{.underline}. Citizenship over foreign nations. Civilians
over military. Diabetes over motherhood. [How do we weigh one life
against another?]{.underline} [How do we decide whose life is worth
more?]{.underline} Whose life is worth more and whose life is expendable
as collateral damage? [Which factors are deemed relevant]{.underline},
[and which are not?]{.underline} Which goals are deemed worthy, and
which are not? Ultimately, [utilitarian calculus **cannot give us the
answers** to these questions]{.underline}.

[Ice cores]{.underline} taken from places like Antarctica [are among
**the most important archives for understanding past
climates**]{.underline}. As ice accumulates, it creates layers. [When
drilled, these layers reveal a wealth of information, from dust
concentrations that signal global wind patterns to bubbles of ancient
air that disclose the chemical composition of past
atmospheres]{.underline}. The layers closest to the surface are thicker,
allowing scientists to see how individual seasons and storms impacted
climate. The layers furthest from the surface are compacted and have
thinned over time due to glacial dynamics, but [these layers allow
scientists to understand past climates at longer time
scales]{.underline} (Alley 2000). The data taken from these cores [help
reconstruct patterns of past climates; however, this data is also
increasingly used to understand human history.]{.underline} As Antonello
and Carey (2017, 194) note,"[Ice cores are as much about humans as they
are about glaciers and climates, and indeed ice ties people and climate
together closely]{.underline}, in some ways synchronizing them." While
much of [the effort of finding human traces in ice cores is used to
further justify the roots of anthropogenic climate change,]{.underline}
ice cores have also been used to reconstruct historical events. For
example, data taken from two high-[resolution Antarctic ice core
records--the Law Dome]{.underline} and the Western Antarctic Ice
Sheet--show a reduction in atmospheric CO2 of 7-10 parts per million
between 1570 and 1620. These decreases in atmospheric CO2 cor- respond
with what Lewis and Maslin (2015) define as the"Orbis Spike," which
[they argue is a **"golden spike," or start date, for the apparent
Anthropocene. This historical moment in the ice record correlates with
the socioecological aftermath of the arrival of Europeans in the
Caribbean in 1492.**]{.underline} Prior to the arrival of Europeans,
there was an estimated 54--61 million people living in the Americas,
which dropped to a minimum of about 6 million people by 1650 due to
disease, famine, war, and enslavement. [The dearth in population led to
increased carbon sequestration, as approximately 50 million hectares of
farming land was left fallow and regenerated over the course of 100
years.]{.underline} According to Lewis and Maslin (2015, 175),"[This dip
in atmospheric CO2 is the **most prominent feature**, in terms of both
rate of change and magnitude, in pre-industrial CO2 records **over the
past 2,000 years**]{.underline}." Considering the Orbis Spike not only
is it **[possible to link the origins of the apparent Anthropocene to
colonialism]{.underline}** (Davis and Todd 2017; Yusoff 2018), it is
possible to see how the same social relations that led to [the
inequalities of the present]{.underline} (e.g., an adherence to
Enlightenment-era rationalization via homo oeconomicus), left unchecked,
[are likely to extend into the future climate]{.underline} (Erickson
2020). Further, [when read through the lens of the inhuman, the
**increased sequestration of carbon** due to increased photosynthesis is
less about vegetative regeneration than it **is about the death of
millions of people never considered human.**]{.underline} Taking [the
obvious presence of the absence of certain human lives in the ice record
into account, I find Gordon's (2008) writing on ghostly matters
relevant]{.underline}. Her work is motivated by a "desire to find a
method of knowledge production and a way of writing that could represent
the damage and the haunting of the historical alternatives and thus
richly conjure, describe, narrate, and explain the liens, the costs, the
forfeits, and the losses of modern systems of abusive powerTROUBLE WITH
MODELING THE HUMAN 393 in their immediacy and worldly significance"
(Gordon 2008, xvii). On [haunting,]{.underline} she (2008, 7--8) writes,
it"[is a constituent of modern social life," and being haunted"draws us
affectively]{.underline}, some- times against our will and always a bit
magically [into the structure of feeling of a reality we come to
experience,]{.underline} not as cold knowledge, but as a transformative
recognition." In the case of the Orbis Spike[, I find the
present-absence of millions of lives ghostly; being **haunted by this
absence** demands a radical recognition of those lives that are
presently absent, meaning that the present climate--its material
composition and its associated impacts on contemporary human life--is
haunted by these past lives]{.underline}. The way [human history is
typically interpolated into the ice record, as a signal for all
humanity, is significant for understanding not only the way a flattened
humanity is then projected into the future,]{.underline} but also to the
ways in which [climate science]{.underline}, and its modes of knowledge
production, [are also haunted]{.underline}. Carey et al.'s (2016)
article on the gendered dimensions of glaciological science highlights
how certain humans have been historically excluded from the production
of knowledge around ice and climate. However, this argument could be
taken a step further to suggest that [the purposeful absenting of
certain human lives is a necessary function of this knowledge
production.]{.underline} Reflecting on the death of Trayvon Martin,
James and Vargas argue that Black death is a predict- able and
constituent part of U.S. democracy. They ask,"What will happen then if
instead of demanding justice we recognized (or at least consider) that
the very notion of justice... produces and requires Black exclusion and
death as normative?" (2014, 193). Following a similar logic with regards
to environmental knowledge production, w[hat if marginalized lives have
been historically excluded as a matter of scientific praxis? Consider
that the father of glaciology,]{.underline} Louis Agassiz, was also the
father of scientific racism in the U.S. (Gordon 2008), or that John
Muir, founder of the conservation organization Sierra Club, [was a white
supremacist]{.underline} (Fears and Mufson 2020). In their analysis of
plastic pollution, Liboiron (2021) articulates how [pollution
science--and its assumptions about land use, contamination, etc.--are
inherently based on colonial ideas of natural relations as universal and
the absenting of Indigenous knowledge systems]{.underline}. When
hindcasting the inhuman, **[the present becomes an amalgamation of
ghosts]{.underline}**. [The present- absence of the millions of lives
lost due to European colonization can be seen in the chemical
composition of our rapidly warming climate]{.underline}. Thinking
through the lens of the inhuman allows for a deeper understanding of the
intersecting materialities and subjectivities of past lives not
considered human and their socioecological relations. However, [as with
hindcasting in climate modeling, hindcasting the inhuman allows for a
reckoning with past inequalities regarding attributions to climate
change and with colonial practices and social relations that have led to
the manifestation of the apparent Anthropocene]{.underline}. With these
necessary calibrations in mind, this paper now turns toward the future.
FORECASTING THE INHUMAN Given the climatic history of the inhuman
outlined above, it is possible to see that future projec- tions of the
human can only be validated when compared to one specific model of the
human (e.g., homo oecnomicus), whereas other ways of being human are
doomed. This is not surprising, of course, as many [queer and people of
color were never meant to survive under liberalism]{.underline} (Lorde
2007; Luciano and Chen 2015). In this section, I aim to build upon the
hindcasting of the

Introduction [**The liquid legacies** of transatlantic slavery continue
to spill over into the present, not just figuratively---in the sense
that racial capitalism saturates contemporary ecologies and
economies---but materially, too.]{.underline} [Slavery altered the
natural hydrology of the American South (Silkenat 81). Industrialized
agriculture was dependent not only on precipitation patterns---as in,
rainfall for harvest---but also on drainage systems to facilitate the
control of water.]{.underline} Along the Mississippi River, enslaved
people were deployed to build and maintain [canals and
levees]{.underline} were used to prevent flooding and to assist the
cultivation of crops in low-lying areas across the Mississippi Delta and
Louisiana. However, as Anna Hartnell writes, "In time it would become
apparent that \[. . .\] [man-made levees deprive the soil of the water
and sediment that builds the land \[. . .\] and keeps it from collapsing
in on itself and sinking"]{.underline} (934). In the words of Richard
Campanella, "All this creates air pockets in the soil body, into which
those sand, silt, and clay particles settle, consolidate---and drop
below sea level" (Campanella). Compounded by anthropogenic climate
change and the construction of oil pipelines, [the hydraulic

I reflect on how the ending of the novel, ultimately, resonates with
histories of "marronage and other forms of fugitive mobilities," which
as Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen and Alex Moulton write, "highlight the social
and spatial dynamics of resistance and refashioning that African,
African-descended, and Indigenous people enacted wherever chattel
slavery existed" (1260). Through the neoslave narrative, Ward salvages
the miscellaneous water-related histories and knowledges that are
bypassed by the limited purview of the Anthropocene (tailored
exclusively to the Western "Anthropos") as well as terrestrial
definitions of the Plantationocene. If, as Lucy Bond argues, [the
Anthropocene induces a "crisis of memory" through the perpetuation of
"narratives that serve to mask the historical connection between
socio-economic and ecological violence]{.underline}" (196-197), then Let
Us Descend complicates that strategic forgetfulness by articulating how
[**the so-called natural environment is physically and metaphorically
soaked in** histories of transatlantic slavery and its liquid
legacies]{.underline}. The liquid Plantationocene is a nod to two
critical interventions in which the concept of liquid(ity) has proven to
be a generative framework for understanding the fluid dynamics of racial
capitalism. The first is Hartnell's work on the experience of "[**liquid
precarity**" in what is now a sinking New Orleans (933). Whereas Zygmunt
Baumon employs the notion of "liquid modernity" to describe the
unfettered flows of global capitalism, Hartnell identifies the
phenomenon of"liquid precarity" that continues to emerge as a result of
the earth's inability to withstand the weight of racial capitalism
(933). As Hartnell reminds, this liquid precarity is evidenced by the
sea's ongoing absorption of the soil in Louisiana. Second, Rinaldo
Walcott's "The Black Aquatic" centers both the metaphorical and material
proponents of liquid. Walcott argues that "Blackness begins in the
context of liquidity---the coffle and the slave ship are its
founding.]{.underline} From historical examples like the ships Amistad
and Zong, we see how [liquidity marks the birth of black possibility
and/or potentialities that come into being. Liquidity, too, has its
opposite: liquidation"]{.underline} (66). In doing so, Walcott draws the
reader's attention to "[the liquidity of people and economies in which
the historical implications of the ship meet the contemporary
liveability of Black]{.underline} peoples' [lives]{.underline}" (66).
Thus, while the concept of [the Blue Plantationocene]{.underline} might
have situated this essay firmly within the field of **[blue
humanities]{.underline}** scholarship, I want to maintain the focus on
liquid that emerges in the work of both Hartnell and Walcott. [Blue
humanities]{.underline} discourse [is usually focused on the
possibilities that emerge when marine science and cultural studies are
combined to challenge anthropocentric understandings of the sea

[What remains of bodies once they turn blue?]{.underline} In life, not
in death. When the colour of the blood running through your veins is no
longer red but blue. When you breathe out blue? When the stench of
cruelty of your masters in the form of your sweat and blood in indigo
vats might be the only familiar smells to you; the vats the only land
you know, as you continue to inhale and exhale more blue. When these
rancid, claustrophobic, incarcerating vats are the land you are coerced
to feel familiar with? When the limits of your body blurred with those
of vats so that you no longer know where your body ends and where the
vats begin? Or where the blue begins and ends? [How do we begin to
theorize blue blood, blue lungs, blue fingers, the blue stuck underneath
the nails, the blue breath that stretched Black and brown bodies across
the four continents?]{.underline} I want to think about how we can read
for extensions of these bodies in Divakaruni\'s poem about blue lungs
and breaths of Bengali peasants to the already-always blue hands of the
unborn, already enslaved child (Sharpe, 2016; Dash, 1991) to land that
too turned blue (and red) from the indigo seeds that were unethically
and forcefully thrust deep into its heart? The blue was grown on all
four continents with European masters and colonisers raping the land,
the women, enslaving Black people, and starving Black and brown
colonized people into (strategic) submission. In this chapter, I argue
that the legacy of colour blue needs to attend to racial, colonial and
imperial violence which produced it. I argue that attending to the
violence of blue means thinking about colonialism from British Raj to
the Americas; that it means thinking about slavery and the hierarchy of
labour conditions produced through transnational travels of blue. Once
again, this means bringing unlikely, seemingly unconnected spaces
together in a conversation. [Blue coloured the four
continents]{.underline}. And in this chapter, I try to hold onto its
trace to understand the intimacies of the four continents produced
through colour. In order to make clear why I stopped at blue lungs and
fingers, I need to take a brief detour and talk about 211 some critical
Black feminist and decolonial works that read marks on bodies within a
context of systems of domination. For instance, in her book, In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being, Black American feminist scholar, Christina
Sharpe (2016) argues an extended meditation on slavery and its afterlife
which she calls \"wake work\". I have engaged with wake work as an
analytic, method and ethics of engaging with resilient Black life in my
chapter on Theoretical Framework.119 Some of the key constellations of
the text include the ship, the hold, and the weather through which she
maps the co-ordinates of Black life despite death, as Sharpe puts it
(p.20). I have found myself pausing on her discussion of the ship
several times, and write about it here not to (perhaps once again)
present Black life as one that is always slipping, always on the ebb of
(normative) life, but to think through a mark, a taped piece of paper
that becomes a site, or rather, a modality, of imprinting on Black flesh
through which Black life is often made visible (to non-Black people like
myself). I also discuss this to illustrate that these markings have a
history. Sharpe discusses a photograph she comes upon in her archival
work looking through images of a catastrophic earthquake, of a little
Haitian girl who, injured, with a wound on her face, is lying on a
stretcher with an ice pack under her head. What struck Sharpe (and the
readers) about this photograph is a piece of transparent tape on her
forehead, with the word \"Ship\" written on it. Sharpe contextualizes
her discussion of this photograph, and the \'mark,\' within a
\"semiotics of the slave ship\" (p. 21). She discusses Zong, a slave
ship which brought enslaved African people from the West coast of Africa
to Jamaica in 1781, and deliberately drowned 132 people (or 140 or 142,
as Sharpe points out) en route due to lack of water on board, and for
filing insurance claims since no insurance money would have been paid
had these African people died of \"natural death\".120 When Sharpe comes
upon that photograph of the little Black girl, she cannot look at that
image outside the history of slavery and present of Black incarceration
in a police-plantation state of Haiti; she could not analyze the word
Ship on the girl\'s forehead outside of the marks that were burnt into
flesh of abducted Africans before they were huddled onto slave ships
(48- 49); she could not analyze it outside Zong, outside of other slave
ships and the Middle 119 As I have said in my Theoretical Framework as
well, wake work is more than just an analytic. Sharpe argue for it as an
ontology of Black life as well, something which I have respectfully
stayed away from employing in my work as a non-Black scholar. 120 As
Sharpe 212 Passage, and the Atlantic on whose bed are buried uncountable
African people in the 400 years of slavery. Sharpe writes: Is Ship a
proper name? A destination? An imperative? A signifier of the
im/possibility of Black life under the conditions of what, Stephanie
Smallwood tells us, \"would become an enduring project in the modern
Western world \'of\] probing the limits up to which it is possible to
discipline the body without extinguishing the life within\" (Smallwood
2008, 35-36)? Is Ship a reminder and/or remainder of the Middle Passage,
of the difference between life and death? Of those other Haitians in
crisis sometimes called boat people? Or is Ship a reminder and/or
remainder of the ongoing migrant and refugee crisis unfolding in the
Mediterranean Sea and the Indian and Atlantic Oceans? Given how visual
and literary culture evoke and invoke the Middle Passage with such
deliberate and reflexive dysgraphic unseeing, I cannot help but
extrapolate. (p. 46) Sharpe also highlights the other ways in which
Blackness circulates through the figures of the captive, migrant, and
refugee in her reading of the word Ship. Living Black life is performing
wake work, always in an intimate relationship with death in the world
because Blackness and Black people are constantly denied life. Once
again, it is important for me to reiterate that I do not discuss this
image to resign Black life to terror and death. Taking cues from
Sharpe\'s scholarship, I want to question how we can make sense of the
blue lungs, blue fingers/nails, blue unborness (Dash, 1991), [blue blood
and blue breaths]{.underline} that [marked the lands of Indigenous
peoples as coerced into settlement]{.underline} [by Black and brown
hands across the Empire, and flesh and skins of Black and brown
people]{.underline} as it spanned the whole of European and American
Empires. As a non-Black and non-Indigenous person looking at the image
in Sharpe's book I am trying to actively think about the \"ethical
demands on the viewer,\" (Sharpe, p. 51) and I would add, of the reader
here. The question of how to be ethical and responsible when
encountering the little Black girl, about whom we know nothing more,
none of the humanizing co-ordinates outside of the narrative of
earthquake (that always seemingly happen by force of nature and devour
Black and brown people) and aids agency, in the archive continues to
stay with me. It is a struggle to even become aware of my orientation to
Black lives in these moments. I am working with the ethic that we
non-Black people have a responsibility of treating with care (and
attention to complicity in anti-Blackness) this becoming of the Haitian
girl into a ship. 213 I write this with an understanding that Black
fungibility is not the same as the multitude of labouring Bengali
peasants I write about here. Black fungibility, as Tiffany King (2014)
argues drawing upon Black feminist scholars like Saidiya Hartman and
Hortense Spillers, is a "key analytic for thinking about Blackness and
settler colonialism in White settler nation-states". She writes: The
space making practices of settler colonialism require the production of
Black flesh as a fungible form of property, not just as a form of labor.
In Scenes of Subjection, Saidiya Hartman argues that the enslaved embody
the abstract "interchangeability and replaceability" that is endemic to
the commodity (Hartman, 1997, p. 21). [Beyond, the captive body's use as
labor, the Black body has a figurative and metaphorical value that
extends into the realm of the discursive and symbolic. (n.p) In pointing
out some instances of how imperial, colonial and racial processes
undergirding the life of natural indigo entangled the lives of enslaved
Africans and colonized Bengali peasants,]{.underline} I am not looking
for drawing any comparisons for there are no one-dimensional, easily
graspable, readily available units that can be compared here.121 I am
also trying to be careful that I do not make the argument that their
labour is what made them similar or even comparable to each other. What
I want to pay attention to in this chapter is how the [blue moved around
the globe, marking bodies and consolidating vertical and horizontal
hierarchies of the human]{.underline}. I attended to Black fungibility
because Blackness was and remains the most dehumanized as Sylvia Wynter,
Christina Sharpe, Saidiya Hartman and other Black scholars I have
discussed in my Theoretical Framework have noted. In order to talk about
[dehumanizing of Bengali peasants]{.underline}, to take into account the
resistance against this dehumanizing, I wanted to signal Black
fungibility as the first and core site of historical and ongoing
practices of dehumanizing. Colour has been an important site for how we
can \"approach anew the question of cultural exchange, violence and
resistance,\" notes Natasha Eaton (2013), a scholar of Art History. This
is certainly true for indigo for it has generated so much fascination,
hatred, oppression, but also, revolutions. The politics of indigo has
made it into a malevolent colour, making Empire stick together through
the blood of variously colonized peoples, and those enslaved and brought
to continental America, to the Caribbean, to South America, and to the
121 Please see my Theoretical Framework on discussion of politics of
Black flesh. 214 ryots (small land-owning peasants) of Bengal, Bihar,
and Orissa and everywhere else where Europeans went in search of land,
labour and other resources. I follow this trajectory of indigo to
reflect upon how [white **settler colonialism, enslavement of Africans
and colonial**/imperial domination across Asia and Africa **constituted
the global power through which indigo was** made into such an important
actant on world stage and i**ntegral to relations of white domination
and Black and brown subordination everywhere** until early 20th century
when synthetic indigo in Germany and elsewhere finally ended this
coercion to grow indigo.]{.underline} In this chapter, I hold onto blue
to make sense of seemingly disjointed spaces, temporalities and people
which indigo brought into often intimate, and always asymmetrical
encounters. I bring together two differently colonized spatial sites of
enactment of racial violence, South Carolina and Bengal by analysing two
important cultural texts of resistance. The first one is a mid-19th
century Bengali protest play that explicated the violence of colonizing
indigo planters and the resistance of the peasants, called Neel Darpan.
The title of the Bengali play means, "Indigo mirror" in its English
translation, the mirror being a "magic mirror which reflects two faces:
the face of the tyrant, and the face of the aggrieved victim of tyranny"
(Pradhan, date unknown). It reflects the harsh reality of the
ordinariness and everydayness of cruelty of the East India Company and
the accompanying British Raj, and also makes an attempt at capturing the
violence against but also the resistance of the colonized (though more
so of the coerced Bengali landlords rather than that of ryots or the
peasants themselves). This play is the focus of my analysis and I
examine it to think about anticolonial resistance of colonized Bengali
people, but also, and more importantly, to pause on how these discourses
of resistance could also work toward strengthening colonial and native
elites in power, and in turn supporting the rule of white masters. I
discuss the play in more detail later on in this chapter, but want to
point out here too that Neel Darpan is not an infallible example of a
radical anticolonial play that should be emulated in designing
discourses of resistance and freedom. The play is problematic in how it
centers the bodies of class and caste privileged landowning (zamindar)
men rather than the ryots and those landless peasants who were Muslims
and/or Dalit and had lived under the tyranny of these landlords even
before British colonial relations were consolidated in Bengal. I have
come to believe that it is precisely the problematic nature of the play
that makes it more important to analyze if our goal is to think about
questions of complicity in colonialism 215 here and there even as
injured colonized subjects of history. What can be perceived as failure,
I believe and argue, is pedagogically more important for learning to
resist better than trying to live or emulate some previous example of
resistance that left the landless/low caste/Dalit/Muslim subaltern
people as silent and vestigial. In this chapter, I also want to reflect
upon the conversation that can be facilitated between Neel Darpan and
Daughters of the Dust, a 1991 independent film by Black filmmaker and
novelist, Julie Dash. The film is set in early 20th century Dawtuh
Island, located on the Sea Islands off the South Carolina coast where
thousands of Africans had been enslaved during the last three quarters
of 18th century. Set in 1902, the film is a story of three generation of
Gullah women whose hands were stained blue from growing indigo on
plantations. Just as in Neel Darpan, indigo is the impetus for the
entire film, but centers enslaved (and free) Black women of past,
present and future instead of landlords and relatively class and caste
privileged ryots. It's also a woman-centered narrative that disrupts the
linearity of time by indicating a future for previously enslaved Black
people (through the figure of the unborn daughter). My choice to stage
and facilitate a discussion between two literal and textual spaces that
do not make any obvious references to each other might beget the
question of why this should and can be done. To begin to answer this
question, I note that I have known of Neel Darpan for much longer than I
have known about Indigenous peoples and enslaved Black people in the New
World who were also coerced into growing indigo. My earliest knowledge
about indigo came from stories told by my Bengali Muslim mother who
probably knows (of) indigo more intimately than I ever will. She has
heard more stories and have seen indigo fields and grew up playing in
and around neel kuthi, or blue walled houses built by European planters
during initial days of indigo trade in a small city of Narayanganj,
outside of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where she lived with her large
working-class family and was one of the nine children of factory
workers. Neither of us are certain about who in our families grew indigo
but considering the fact that my mother's family comes from the Nadia
district of East Bengal (in present-day India) and Bangladesh (part of
India until 1947 and then Pakistan until 1971), and were among the
poorest of Hindu peasants who converted to Ismailism122 in 122 Ismailism
is a branch of Shi\'i Islam. While scholarly studies into conversion of
Hindus to Ismailism in South Asia have yet to be carried out
systematically in terms of caste, hearing some stories from 100s of
years ago 216 17th- to 18th centuries to escape caste relations under
Hinduism that were intimately tied to their depressed class and caste
positions, it is likely that they saw themselves reflected in the
anticolonial struggles of which Neel Darpan is a part. We grew up
hearing stories from my mother, grandparents and aunties about brave men
and women who spent their lives struggling against the brutal realities
of the East India Company rule in India. From stories of getting
tortured and killed by British sahibs to a fable of an old woman who fed
those "evil sahibs" of the East India Company poisoned roti (bread),
tales of revolutionaries who fought the sahibs who would beat us for
land, for labour, and our women; in fact, for our very souls. And for
colours, which, in these stories, grew by \'magic\' in the soil. [This
magic sent blue poison deep into the veins and blood of my ancestors.
They grew poison and died in the process and all of this so that
Europeans and Americans could wear blue clothes! I have been very angry
thinking about the millions of deaths of Black and brown people and
their futures around the world just so there can be blue uniforms, gowns
and drapes. Initially, I planned to only write about European planters
and the East India Company's violence against the Bengali peasants, and
focus on colonizer-colonized, but also the hierarchical relations
amongst the colonized. However, once I began to read up more widely on
the history of indigo --the transnationality of its reach, and the
poison it infused not only in brown bodies but also how it stained Black
flesh --it became increasingly difficult to not contextualize indigo
within the context of enslavement and deaths of Black
people.]{.underline} Without thinking about the blue-stained hands of
women in Nana Peazant's family in Dash's film --presented as both, a
poetics of slavery and resistance --thinking about indigo in Bengal
(only) seemed to be just a small piece of the story. Living in North
America, talking about colonial violence unleashed by the British
planters on Bengalis prompted me to unforget how I live where I now
live, and how integral it is to my narratives to pay attention to the
colour now surviving in Gujarati language, and from knowledge passed
down in family and the larger community, I know that most of us
converted to Ismailism to escape caste tyranny. I understand my
ancestors as belonging to Chamar caste of Dalit people. However, it is a
subject position which I do not claim today given that among Ismailis,
caste hierarchies are disavowed and for generations now we have grown up
without knowing casteist violence. I now understand myself to be a
privileged caste person in diaspora and hold myself complicit in
upholding caste hierarchies. This is despite the fact that caste
definitely shows in our surnames, whether it be my adopted mid-caste
surname of Patel or my extended family\'s surname of Kachra which means
garbage in Hindi/Urdu. It was a surname which they think marked their
means of living as generations of garbage collectors at the time of
conversion to Islam/Ismailism. I, however, do not know how or why we
changed our paternal last name or what it actually was before Patel or
even how this name change was possible in a very casteist South Asia. I
have yet to examine my own family histories and of caste relations among
Ismailis of earlier centuries. 217 which marked bodies of other
colonized and enslaved peoples of the New World. For a long time now,
because of the stories I grew up with, I have known that blue killed.
What I realize only more recently is that **[blue is an archive in
itself]{.underline}**. So much has happened out of the blue; so much
violence has come out of the blue. Indigo blue is an archive that has
brought the peasants whose stories I grew up hearing together with
enslaved and Indigenous peoples in the New World. This chapter is a
small attempt at reading that vast, transnational archive of blue
through the play and the film. Bringing these texts and spaces into
conversation has been difficult for me because my academic training, as
I have stated in my introductory chapter, has prepared me to hold onto
mostly clear-cut boundaries of fields, theories, temporalities, and
geographies. Attempting to draw these connections when there is no
linear narrative to present in easily consumable bits is a daunting
task. Again and again I would give up on writing this chapter because
tracing the legacies and connections left in the wake of blue has been
difficult since the boundaries around different archives have been kept
strictly segregated.123 But [labour exploitation, imperialism,
colonialism and slavery are all encoded in the sign of
indigo]{.underline} but so is the resistance of the ryots, of the
enslaved and of other colonized peoples coerced into growing indigo for
Europe and later, America. The colonized people in Neel Darpan and Nana
Peazant\'s family in Daughter of the Dust are already in conversation
with each other even if the conversations are placed in different
spatio-temporal coordinates. Linking imperialism in India with colonial
and racial violence of the New World despite the vast geographical and
chronological divide is actually needed because as I have argued in
another chapter, the colonizers of the New World who were also the
Master of the stolen and enslaved people, later came to India as East
India Company officials, as planters, as private business holders,
adventurers and soldiers. Reading these texts in relation to each other
provides an analytical framework that decolonizes the kinds of archival
and representational separations that constitute and reproduce
present-day colonial discontinuities and "afterlives of slavery"
(Hartman, 1997). Moreover, I take heed from Gyandera Pandey's (2008)
instruction in his editorial on bringing changing modes of
disenfranchisement in South Asia and the US into conversation with each
other. He writes: 123 I have discussed this in more detail in my chapter
on methodology. I am also very grateful to Lisa Lowe's (2006, 2015) work
for encouraging me to think through the archival boundaries. 218 The
juxtaposition of different bodies of scholarship and differing debates
should help to bring about a new awareness, not only of shared histories
and shared struggles in the making of the modern world, but of
particularities and facets of our different histories and societal
conditions that we have simply assumed as being well understood, and
hence taken for granted. (p. 272) From India to Arabia to Europe and
Africa and back to India, indigo moved along trade routes, solidifying
human hierarchies of colonizers, colonized, Masters, slaves,
planters/colonizers, and the colonized/peasants. This chapter is not an
effort at writing a better or more complete story of indigo. However, it
is an effort at expanding the analytical frames within which scholars of
South Asia and British Empire have looked at indigo production in
Bengal. I want to place the stories of indigo I know with the ones I am
beginning to learn about. I try to do that without losing the
specificities of the forms of violence indigo travels took in different
continents and time periods. In her truly remarkable doctoral project
titled, In the Clearing: Black Female Bodies, Space and Settler Colonial
Landscapes, Tiffany Lethabo-King (2013) argues for development of what
she calls, "simultaneous vision" (p. 32) in order to "see" how slavery
and settler colonialism structure one another. Indebted to her work, in
this chapter, I argue for bringing in the journey of indigo in South
Asia too to help us better \"see\" how colonialism in one place was
entangled with so many other stories of violence and people(s), and to
"see" how the indigo which stained the hands of the women in Daughters
of the Dust also structured the lives and death of colonized people in
India. This has been important for me as I continue to think about the
question of interconnectedness of white settler colonialism, slavery,
and other imperial and colonial enterprises of British and American
empires. In the next section, I give a brief summary of the
transnational travels of indigo. I will then discuss the play, paying
attention to the question of radicality of the play and discussing my
reasons for choosing it in more detail. I will analyze the play by
holding onto the social formations of caste, coloniality, and whiteness
in order to understand how anticolonial resistance of peasants was
co-opted by elite native perceptions of the 1860 Blue Mutiny. I then
look into the debates on "slavery" in East India and West India with a
focus on the question of freedom. It was in these debates that the
colonizers/Master/planters/EIC officials 219 brought the ryots from
"East India" into conversation with slaves on plantations of "West
India". Alluding to these debates, I insist on holding together both
these figures conventionally held apart by disciplinarily-separated
archives. I will end this chapter by analyzing Dash\'s film to reflect
on what I have learned about resistance from it.

THE PERSISTENT LIVES OF TRANSATLANTIC SLAVERY

Ultimately [the law decides who gets legal personality and status: there
is nothing spontaneous about it.]{.underline} (McLean, 'The
Transnational Corporation in History', p. 376)

[Discussions of legal personhood today most often centre on the
corporation]{.underline}. In American jurisprudence, the corporation is
defined as a legal entity with rights and obligations that are separate
from its members. As critics have argued, [the corporation is a legal
form that emerged from histories of colonial exploitation including
transatlantic slavery]{.underline}. For Janet McLean (2004), the
corporation can be traced directly to the joint stock company.
Therefore, [colonial expansion and appropriation]{.underline}, she
argues, [must 'be viewed as a history of the corporate
form']{.underline} (p. 363). Others have traced [the rise of the
corporation to transatlantic slavery]{.underline} (Logan, 2019). In the
1880s, the US Supreme Court expanded [the fourteenth
amendment]{.underline}, originally [intended to extend citizenship and
protect the person- hood of formerly enslaved peoples, to include
corporations.]{.underline} Between 1868 and 1911, as Nneka Logan (2019)
argues, the Supreme Court heard 604 cases that centred on the fourteenth
amendment. Only 28 of these dealt with the rights of formerly enslaved
peoples, and only in 6 cases did the court uphold their interests
(Logan, 2019, p. 980). These decisions, Logan (2019, p. 977) contends,
'ushered in an unprecedented era of corporate wealth, power, and
privilege' at the expense of the personhood of the formerly enslaved.
Whereas McLean (2004) focusses on the corporation as a product of
British imperial expansion, Logan (2019, p. 978) traces the durability
of racial ideologies produced through transatlantic slav- ery, which
continue to make it uncontroversial for 'certain people to be treated as
things and the things of certain people to be treated as persons in
American jurisprudence'. [The genealogy of legal personhood]{.underline}
that I have started to sketch out here, while appreciative of these
arguments, [points to a longer and entangled history of Anglo imperial
maritime contests. **Marshall and Story borrowed from maritime customs
and British admiralty law to designate ships as legal persons,
determinations that extended US jurisdiction along the Atlantic while
allowing the courts to address inter-imperial conflicts over commerce,
piracy, and illegal slavery at sea.**]{.underline} [At roughly **the
same time**, they also decided on the legal person- hood and
**non-personhood of slaves**.]{.underline} When these cases are read
together, [mari- time law and the laws of slavery emerge as
interconnected and integral to the history of legal
personhood]{.underline}.

[The (after)lives of slavery are most often traced to the criminal
justice system,]{.underline} especially the mass incarceration of
African Americans and the ongoing police vio- lence directed at Black
communities (Alexander, 2010; Davis, 2001; DeLombard, 2019, p. 514). But
[the persistent lives of transatlantic slavery are manifest in other
ways that often go unremarked and unnoticed. Slavery was foundational to
the rise of shipping, insurance, and banking]{.underline} (Armstrong,
2004; Baucom, 2005; Williams, 1944, pp. 98--102). The transatlantic
slave trade, James Walvin (2013) observes, has been described as 'the
most international of all commercial activities before the nineteenth
century.' Its ships were drawn from all corners of the Atlantic world,
and the goods loaded on board were themselves gathered from the most
distant parts of the globe, all in the intention of acquiring slaves.
(p. 72)

Moreover, [the maritime legal instruments that transformed persons into
prop- erty]{.underline} -- [ship logs, ledgers, and account books --
have shaped a range of contempo- rary business practices including
speculative finance, insurance, accounting, and bookkeeping]{.underline}
(Armstrong, 2004; Baucom, 2005; Rosenthal, 2018). The origins of
[corporations]{.underline}, especially [banks and insurance
companies]{.underline}, which [emerged and expanded during the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,]{.underline} can be [traced
directly to the triangular trade, and reveal the interconnections
between shipping and Atlantic slavery]{.underline} (Baucom, 2005, pp.
38--40; Rupprecht, 2016, p. 33). **[The legal mutability of the ship and
the slave created the conditions of possibility for a flourishing
Atlantic commerce]{.underline}** that was [**underpinned by racial and
colonial vio- lence**.]{.underline} [This history only fully
materialises]{.underline} [when maritime worlds are foregrounded in
legal histories of slavery.]{.underline}

As I completed this chapter in summer 2020, the Black Lives Matter move-
ment was gaining global traction in protests across US, Canadian, and
British cities. Amidst global demands for racial justice -- in response
to the death of George Floyd and too many other Black women and men
murdered by police -- Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance
provider, finally admitted its role in the transatlantic slave trade.
The company is included in the 'Legacies of British Slave-ownership
Project', a database compiled by a group of schol- ars led by Professor
Catherine Hall and hosted by University College London (see Hall,
Draper, McClelland, Donnington, & Lang, 2014). However, it was not until
June 2020, in a global moment of protest condemning anti-Black violence,
that Lloyd's finally issued a public apology for their involvement in
the Atlantic slave trade, which they described as an 'appalling and
shameful period of English history' (Ziady, 2020). [The effects of the
slave trade]{.underline}, they acknowledge, [extends well beyond
eighteenth and nineteenth century England]{.underline}. However, the
origin of Lloyd's can be traced to the heart of London and to a
historical period when developments in the laws of shipping and slavery
visibly influenced one another. Established in 1687 by Edward Lloyd,
what is now a global insurance giant began as a local coffee house on
Tower Street near the River Thames. Early patrons included seafarers,
captains, and 'ship's husbands', who frequented the coffee house to
complete their daily business and to exchange news on maritime arrivals,
departures, and events (Herschaft, 2005, p. 170). Lloyd later expanded
his busi- ness to include the collection and distribution of maritime
information. He sent men to nearby ports so they could report and record
maritime traffic and events. Lloyd's, the company, eventually started a
weekly trade newspaper, Lloyd News, a shipping registry, and a thriving
maritime insurance business (Herschaft, 2005, p. 171). Lloyd's did not
begin underwriting marine insurance, including ships and (human) cargos,
until the eighteenth century. By then, Edward Lloyd was already
complicit in the Atlantic slave trade (Dua, 2019, p. 494; Williams,
1944). Fugitive slave advertisements that were placed in London
newspapers 'listed Lloyd's as the place they \[fugitive slaves\] should
be returned' (Williams, 1944, p. 104). In the maritime worlds engendered
by Edward Lloyd's coffee house, [ships and slaves were already
connected, as they would be in US maritime law and in the jurispru-
dence of slavery]{.underline}.

In The Mirror of the Sea, Conrad (1906) gives his readers a glimpse into
a dynamic and tumultuous ocean world where winds, waves, ships, and
anchors collide and combine to illuminate the entanglements between
human and more- than-human life. [When read through maritime legal
orders]{.underline}, his ruminations, [particularly on the personality
of ships -- their names, temperaments, and heter- onormative relations
-- invite an alternative genealogy of legal personhood, one that
foregrounds the racial terror of maritime worlds.]{.underline} Conrad's
(1906) negation of the slave, as I suggest throughout, inadvertently
draws attention to Anglo impe- rial contests at sea and to changing
patterns and intensities of racial violence. By reading The Mirror of
the Sea through maritime law and the jurisprudence of slavery, I offer
[an account of legal personhood in which the ship and the slave feature
as central and conjoined characters.]{.underline} [For Marshall and
Story]{.underline}, [the ship was a legal person and an expression of
white male sovereignty even though she was represented through feminine
attributes. The slave, by contrast, was a non-person in US territory,
stripped of gender, identity, and humanity.]{.underline}

What Conrad (1906) missed [in his contention that '\[a\] ship is not a
slave' was the mutability of legal personhood.]{.underline} Writing of
modern law more broadly, Colin Dayan (2011) argues that [law enables and
disables, empowers and dispossesses through the fictions of legal
personhood. 'A series of metamorphoses,]{.underline} both legal and
magical, [transform persons into ghosts, into things and into
animals']{.underline} (p. xvii). In these transformations, Dayan (2011)
continues, 'person, ghost, thing, animal -- which we assume to have
definite boundaries, lose their demarcations' (p. xvii). But in the
decisions made by Marshall and Story, [the slave and the ship reveal an
inherent ambiguity. The line between personhood and property was
shifting in response to a wider racial, imperial, and capitalist order
that demanded exploita- ble land, resources, and labour, and a violent
dispossession of Indigenous nations and enslaved peoples]{.underline}.
Tracing legal personhood through the sea points to longer histories of
racial and colonial violence that join the ship, the slave, and the cor-
poration. [Excavating legal personhood from maritime worlds reveals a
history in which the legal person is not merely a legal fiction or a
metaphysical creation, but a racial and gendered artefact born
of]{.underline} Anglo [imperial contests over commerce, including
transatlantic slavery.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Alt

#### Thinking with blue unravels blue desires as both colonial and decolonial. The alt is key to build a praxis of resistance that deconstructs cycles of imperial violence, extraction, and environmental destruction that looks beyond colonial blue desires.

Like the disruptive nature of ultramarine, indigo ignited the movement
for freedom from British rule and their continued exploitation of the
earth, seas, and people through blue colonialisms. [These British blue
colonialisms bring me to the writing and poetic performance of Aotearoa
New Zealand poet Selina Tusitala Marsh, who in her capacity as
Commonwealth poet 2016 shook the continued blue colonialisms and blue
desires of the British Monarchy and Commonwealth empire. When Marsh
walked onstage to perform the poem "Unity" in London's Westminster Abbey
on March 14, 2016, her words and presence reverberated in this imperial
space par excellence]{.underline}. She stood in front of the British
royal family and a legion of high-placed invitees as well as over a
thousand school children. It was Commonwealth Day, and Marsh was that
year's Commonwealth poet. ["It's called the Va in Samoan philosophy /
what you do, affects me / what we do, affects the sea," she
said,]{.underline} addressing the audience, including Her Majesty, Queen
Elizabeth II, who was sitting at the very front, to Marsh's left.47 Of
her experience of the event, her performance, and meeting the royals,
Marsh later writes: She has the most recognisable face in contemporary
Western history and she's almost within my reach. [The longest-reigning
British monarch and I share a few things]{.underline}: we are both

exactly half her age, a quirky fact I thought to share but then my
Samoan discretion got the better of me); and [we are both wearing blue
in a sea of black and beige, as observed by many an attendee
afterwards.48 Marsh was wearing a deep Pacific blue dress and silk wrap
that pays homage to her Samoan-Tuvaluan-English-Scottish-French heritage
but confused some of those present. The blue of Marsh's dress was
interpreted by some attendees as a political response to the royal
setting and the customary royal blue garment of Her Majesty, Queen
Elizabeth II, who that day was wearing a powder-blue dress and matching
hat. "My dear, how politic of you to wear the royal blue," someone said
to Marsh afterward, who answered: "The blue of majestic **te moana nui a
kiwa, the Pacific Ocean**? Why thank you]{.underline}!"49 [Marsh's
appearance and, by extension, the Pacific Commonwealth she represents
are inherently personal and political, and therefore disruptive to the
royal blue traditions at work in Westminster Abbey.]{.underline} There
is often little observable difference between the darker shades of blue.
Navy blue, cobalt blue, royal blue, Pacific blue, Egyptian blue, and
Prussian blue, for instance, sit across a similar range of dark blues of
varying cooler and warmer tones. The name royal blue is said to have
originated with the silks worn by Queen Charlotte---wife of King George
III between 1761 and her death in 1818---at the height of the British
expansion into the Indian indigo trade. Derived from the royal obsession
with the godlike qualities ascribed to the deepest blue shades as well
as the increased appeal of indigo dyes, the royal blue we know today is
a vibrant deep blue shade that is close if not identical to the highest
quality natural ultramarine or the deepest of indigo shades.
T[h]{.underline}e color of the finest lapis lazuli can be described as
"a pure royal blue without blemish" that was turned into a deep and
irresistible blue pigment.50 It is the royal setting that generates the
royal association to the blue shade Marsh was wearing in Westminster
Abbey. [The prominent presence of Pacific blue in Westminster Abbey
disrupts the dominance of reading all deep blues in royal environments
as belonging to European royal empires. Her Pacific blue dress and wrap,
representing the deep blue tones of the Pacific Ocean, entangle the
colonial and the oceanic.]{.underline} The poem Marsh wrote for the 2016
Commonwealth Day celebrations, "Unity," follows the official theme and
implores all Commonwealth nations to come together and "shar\[e\] our
thoughts over a cup of tea."51 Her thoughts, however, politely but
forcefully critique the hierarchies at stake in Commonwealth realities.
The tension between the United Kingdom, the Pacific, and their relative
positions within the wider Commonwealth are palpable as Marsh says:

by guest on 10 December 2024 yet its free."52 [Invoking her heritage and
family history, she takes aim at the idea that "West is best": "my
ancestors were guided by sky and sea trails / and way before Columbus
even hoisted his sails!"53 Her words both symbolically and materially
connect the Pacific region to the United Kingdom: "Did you know there's
a London in Kiribati?"54 Several of Kiribati's atolls and settlements
carry European names: Poland, for example, lies south of London, across
the main lagoon. In her Commonwealth poem Marsh not only talks back to
the continued colonial presence in the South Pacific, she also redefines
the center and moves her audience from London, UK, to London,
Kiribati.55 The blue connections that are drawn in the performance of
"Unity"---the Pacific blue of Marsh's dress against the powder blue of
Queen Elizabeth's---reinforce the idea that thinking of blue addresses
as well as disrupts the extractive colonial legacies that are
inextricably tied to the color. In her poem, Marsh foregrounds that
Commonwealth relations do not exist because of the power that is held in
the United Kingdom, but by virtue of the unity that keeps the queen
alive rather than the other way around. Looking directly at Queen
Elizabeth,]{.underline} she speaks: "bees thrive in hives keeping their
queen / unity keeps them alive, keeps them buzzing / they're key to our
fruit and vege supplies / but parasitic attacks and pesticides /
threaten the bee, then you and me / it's all connected--- that's
unity."56 [The blue unity that Marsh draws on unsettles the extractivist
coloniality that merely serves the continuation of the center of empire.
In an interview about her poetry collection Tightrope (2007), which
features "Unity" as well as two other poems that engage with Marsh's
royal encounters,57 she speaks to the transformative power of poetic
color: "Unity is what my poetry seeks to create. Unity of the
multitudinous stories that constitute our memory, which in turn, form
our history, 'the remembered tightrope,' to quote Albert Wendt. The
morphing colours of that beautiful rainbow line \[on the cover of
Tightrope\] evokes the many hues of our lives that refuse to be
forgotten.]{.underline}"58 The instructions for writing the Commonwealth
poem were to stay away from politics, 52. Marsh, "Unity," lines 23--24.

Fresno-Calleja explains in "Talking Back, Fast, and Beyond" how Marsh
redefines the postcolonial notion of "the empire writes back"---an
expression from Salman Rushdie that became the title of Bill Ashcroft,
Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin's The Empire Writes Back (1995)---and
"conceives of her poetry as a tool to 'talk back,' prioritizing the
performative quality of her work in line with the oral traditions that
inform it and the cultural encounters and representations that
originated in the colonial Pacific and which continue to determine more
contemporary representations" (Fresno-Calleja, "Talking Back, Fast, and

Ngahuia, HRH Elizabeth II, Oprah, and Alice Walker. Marsh describes
Queen Elizabeth II as having "Boucheron blue irises / set in the cool

by guest on 10 December 2024 [but when the personal is political---the
realities of Pacific life influenced by centuries of colonial
politics---the presence of a Pasifika woman in Westminster Abbey can
only ever disrupt colonial blue signification. Her dress, her heritage
and her words embody the continued resistance of the Pacific region
against the imperial coloniality that connects the ocean to the growing
threat of the climate change realities shaping contemporary Pacific
life. Conclusion Thinking with blue not only addresses the importance of
reckoning with coloniality in the blue humanities but also attends to
the powers at work that have always already entangled the blue as
pigment, as textile, as rock, and as symbolic of water, sea, and ocean.
The emergence of the blue humanities as a subfield of the environmental
humanities draws on the ways in which the blue has long been an actant
in the transoceanic movement of power: of riches, trade, violence, and
the consequences of imperial extractive politics. While]{.underline}
both Pothoven and Marsh engage with contemporary colonial and extractive
blues, they work differently with [what blue can do for environmental
futures beyond blue colonial desires]{.underline}. Pothoven's account of
the afterlives of blue extraction and cost of obsessions with Afghan
rocks and caves show that the blue has built empires, taken lives, and
altered environments. His work looks back on the long history of blue
desires. Marsh's poetry, on the other hand, undoes the marginalization
of Pacific blue at the heart of the British Empire. Her performance
visualizes continued blue resistance against imperial power and the
persistent defiance of colonization in the Pacific region. Standing tall
on the Secretarium Steps of Westminster Abbey, she invokes Giotto's blue
ceilings and disrupts royal blue signification. In Marsh's blue
presence, the Pacific is large and the royals seem small. The oceanic
and the blue are entwined, and as exemplified in Pothoven and Marsh's
work pushes beyond a simple equation of the blue in the humanities as

Sigmund [Freud]{.underline} (1856-1939) [insisted that]{.underline} his
postulations that are collectively known as [psychoanalysis formed the
basis for the science of psychology.]{.underline} Yet, ever since its
beginnings in the early years of the twentieth century, [there has been
considerable argument as to whether psychoanalysis is even a science at
all. Some claim that Freud's work itself was entirely
**pseudoscientific**]{.underline} in nature, and that later proponents
of his theory have done little to revise this state of affairs. Yet, in
its approximately one hundred years of existence, [psychoanalysis has
had a tremendous influence on Western culture]{.underline}, and in spite
of all the stones slung in its direction, it still has many supporters
around the globe.

Nobel Laureate Sir Peter Medawar (1984) argues that certain, seemingly
'naïve' questions are beyond the power of pure science to answer, such
as those concerning the purpose of human life. He believes that such
'ultimate questions', as well as psychoanalysis with its subject matter
of 'human nature', belong to the 'domain of myth'. Indeed it is
important to note here that several physical scientists dismiss the
social sciences in general as pseudoscientific.

Before assessing psychoanalysis against the criteria of pseudoscience,
and for that matter, those of science, it is important to briefly
consider what psychoanalysis is, and how it is assumed to work. The
diffusion of Freudian theory is fascinating, it having been adopted for
application in such fields as history, political science, literature,
music and the arts. Further, for many laypersons Freudian theory is
synonymous with psychology. Its goals are immensely ambitious, and
theory and practice work hand-in-hand. Nevertheless, psychoanalysis is
primarily grounded on pseudoscientific postulations that are inherently
non-falsifiable.

Central to Freud's theory is the division of the mind into three levels
of consciousness, the first being the conscious. Below this rests the
preconscious, which contains most of a person's memories, and which in
modern psychological language is equivalent to longterm memory. Below
this lies the unconscious, which is one of the key concepts of
psychoanalysis. According to Freud, this contains feelings, desires and
memories that are repressed from the conscious because they are too
traumatic or painful to deal with directly. One example of this putative
repression is the Oedipus complex, which is concerned with incestuous
desires. A further assumption of the unconscious is that the material in
it is not available to the conscious mind, but nevertheless can
powerfully affect behaviour -- it therefore follows that repressed
memories can result in psychological problems.

Sigmund Freud

A major part of Freud's theory deals with personality development,
particularly from the perspective of sexual behaviour and sexual
identity. Freudian theory is divided into four developmental
psycho-sexual stages. In chronological order these are the oral, anal,
phallic and genital stages. In some of these stages one has to resolve
certain 'complexes' in order to develop normally. In Freud's view,
mature personality consists of the id, the ego and the superego, which
all assume very different roles. The id is considered as the very core
of personality, from which the other structures develop. The id is the
most primitive structure, solely seeking to achieve pleasure and avoid
pain. The superego can be thought of as the conscience of the person.
These structures of personality bind together in a complex manner, and
in individuals regarded as 'normal', they function in an interactive
fashion.

Psychologist Terence Hines (1988) proposes several criteria by which a
field may be judged as being either pseudoscientific or otherwise. [One
characteristic of pseudoscientific theories is that they exhibit
non-falsifiable hypotheses]{.underline}. [Some testable predictions can
be derived from psychoanalysis, but they have typically **been shown to
be untrue**]{.underline}. [Several researchers,]{.underline} such as
Hans Eysenck (1985), [have embarked on the experimental study of
Freudian concepts]{.underline} (see also Eysenck & Wilson, 1973). For
instance, Paul Kline (1968) and Calvin Hall (1954) [have empirically
investigated the Freudian developmental assumption that toilet-training
exerts a great influence on personality]{.underline}. This is based on a
postulation that the mother's training practices, together with her
attitudes towards defecation, cleanliness, control and responsibility,
strongly influence the personality development of the child. [If this
training is strict, then the child may take revenge upon authority
figures by being messy, wasteful, extravagant, etc, or alternatively the
child may become excessively neat and meticulous and develop a fear of
dirt and exhibit overcontrolled behaviours]{.underline}. Hence, [the
theory can explain *post hoc* any extent of tidiness or messiness as
resulting from strict toilet-training.]{.underline} According to Hall,
[this theory becomes *twice* non-falsifiable when the effects of gentle
toilet-training are examined --]{.underline} these are indistinguishable
from the result of strict toilet training, and once more, both
personality styles can be explained *post hoc*, but neither can be
predicted. [In addition to the lack of clear logic in Freud's
postulation of the relationship between toilet-training and personality,
studies investigating the relationship between these variables **have
found no relationship** between the actual toilet training practices
employed by parents and the child's resultant personality
style.]{.underline}

Related to these questionable assumptions of [psychoanalysis are two
equally questionable methods of investigating the alleged memories
hidden in the unconscious: free association and the interpretation of
dreams. Neither method is capable of scientific formulation or empirical
testing.]{.underline} These methods bear no validity in reality. When
these results are taken together with others, it seems plausible to
suggest that **[falsifiability poses a problem for most aspects of
psychoanalysis!]{.underline}**

Daisie and Michael Radner (1982), ardent advocates of scientific
methodology, observe that pseudoscientific proponents are inclined to
"look for mysteries". It could certainly be argued that Freud largely
got away with a lack of scientific rigour in his work due to the
volatile, obscure and often inaccessible content of the subject matter
of psychoanalysis, especially as it relates to human sexuality. Whilst
Richard Webster (1995), a radical psychologist, notes that much of
Freud's theory appears elegant and does display internal coherence, he
argues that 'laws' of human nature are largely covered in mystery, and
it is problematic to change this because, in order to investigate 'human
nature', the power of science is not sufficient. Moreover, many of
Freud's achievements are seen to result from his own charismatic
personality and "the heroic myth which he spun around himself during his
own lifetime" (p. 9). Freud is sometimes likened to a religious,
'messianic' figure, who formed a 'church' and obtained a large crowd of
followers, not because of the scientific basis of his teachings, but
solely because of his authority.

Another of Hines' (1988) observations was that pseudoscientists accuse
sceptics of demanding more proof for their postulations in comparison to
that required for more established theorists. But, as Hines puts it,
"extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof " (p.5). Psychoanalysts
often argue that clinical experiences are the proof for psychoanalytic
theory and thus do not require evidence of the scientific kind, and
these are the facts on which their 'science' is founded. However, since
these data consist of symbolic interpretations of dreams, free
associations, and such, in the light of this discussion such claims may
be seen to be entirely circular in nature. Hines further notes that
pseudoscientific proponents commonly fail to modify their theories in
the light of new evidence. A notable example of this is the idea of
motivated forgetting, also known as repression. Repression is said to be
an active mechanism by which particular memories are prevented from
reaching consciousness due to their emotionally painful content.
Infantile amnesia, referring to the fact that adults usually have
virtually no memories of their infancy, has widely been regarded as
evidence for repression. In Freud's explanation, this is because the
period of early childhood is a time when the child is immersed in strong
sexual desires, which are largely incestuous in nature. Because these
desires cannot be satisfied, frustration follows. For a boy, his sexual
feelings towards his mother may cause castration anxiety. Memories of
these feelings are repressed when the Oedipus complex is resolved. Such
memories cannot be allowed to enter the conscious mind, as there would
be a risk that they would cause perversion and psychological damage. The
[scientific evidence for this notion of unconscious repression is
lacking]{.underline}, [as is any evidence that conscious thought or
behaviour is influenced by repressed memories.]{.underline}

Infantile amnesia is regarded as a real phenomenon, but studies
investigating memory and brain have shown that its causes are far from
the psychoanalytical explanation. The currently accepted explanation is
that infantile amnesia is due to the nature of the brain of the immature
organism. A second important variable in childhood amnesia is the
development of language, i.e., the limited language skills of young
children make it more difficult to memorise information. However, a
large body of evidence showing that infantile amnesia is not due to
repression, but to the immaturity of the infant's brain, has not made
psychoanalysts revise the theory. Another example of a failure to update
psychoanalytic theories is Freud's field of psychohistory, created for
understanding historic individuals. Several flaws in his theorising have
been indicated, but again such theories have not been subsequently
modified.

What is science, then? How scientific is psychoanalysis? According to
Donald Spence (1987), an American psychiatrist, something deserves to be
considered as a science when there is a prevalent regard for the data,
which is available for all interested parties, and when theory is
data-driven and changes in response to new observations. Further, the
progress of the theory is cumulative and the original model may serve as
a basis for newer models. Finally, the claims are based on evidence
rather than on authority. In this view science is immensely democratic.
In terms of the above criteria, psychoanalysis fails on every count.
Frank Sulloway (1979), a psychologist and historian of science, has
actually described psychoanalysis as "a scientific fairytale". However,
the subject matter of psychoanalysis, human sexuality and human nature,
are laden with powerful taboos. Webster (1995) argues that to postulate
theories concerning such issues requires not only intellect, but also
emotional lucidity, something that is not commonly regarded as a
characteristic of the scientific mind. Furthermore, to engage in such an
activity requires a pinch of rebelliousness, which again is a quality
rarely seen amongst those trained in natural sciences. In Webster's
view, scientific ideas should not be judged by their intellectual source
but by their explanatory power.

It cannot be denied, however, that Freud's theory is superlatively
ingenious, creative and perceptive. It further provides an initially
plausible explanation of many aspects of human sexual behaviour. To
dismiss psychoanalysis as being without any intellectual merit or
importance would be wrong, and to do so would dismiss all of the many
respectable authors who ever wrote in the psychoanalytic tradition.

[The majority of psychologists hold that psychoanalysis is a
pseudoscience]{.underline}, but perhaps the very business of examining
Freud's work from the scientific perspective is unnecessarily harsh.
Hans Eysenck, a hard-core behaviourist and iconoclast of the twentieth
century, maintains that for many, Freud's contribution has not been to
the scientific study of human behaviour, but to the interpretation and
meaning of mental events. Specifically, Freud pioneered the desire to
understand those individuals whose behaviour and thinking cross the
bounds of convention dictated by civilization and cultures. It is
difficult to dismiss the importance of psychoanalysis as it is so
tightly entangled with our cultural history. However, perhaps the most
transparent evidence that Freud was wrong is that he is very difficult
for us to understand, and much of him remains an enigma -- in Webster's
(1995, p. 29) words, "a psychologist who is beyond the reach of
psychology, the creator of a movement which has encircled the globe but
which has formulated no theory which can even begin to account for its
own success". [It seems clear to me that **psychoanalysis belongs to the
'domain of myth'**, and while of course myths may be enigmatic, they are
not in the least scientific.]{.underline}

As a number of new imperial historians of Britain have stressed, these
scientists effectively strengthened the connections between
settler-originated constructions of race and metropolitan middle-class
constructions of other kinds of 'internal' social difference (Hall
1996; Hall and Rose 2006). In Hunt's view, the brain of the 'Negro' was
much like that of the European woman or child, and in the view of many
contemporaries, both shared certain characteristics with those of
criminals, Celts and the labouring poor, none of whom were
differentiated through their relations with nature in a metropolitan
context (Bolt 1971). Long-held settler representations, such as those
that were reformulated for metropolitan consumption by Knox and Hunt,
became more powerful in Britain because they articulated a language of
inherent difference in which the relations of British class and gender
could now be more conveniently framed. They helped establish, as Ann
Stoler puts it, 'a "mobile" discourse of empire that designated
eligibility for citizenship, class membership, and gendered assignments
to race' (Stoler 1995, 127--8).

Although, as I have argued, both Anderson and I emphasise in practice
those sets of relations on colonial frontiers that gave rise to racial
discursive shifts in the nineteenth century, there are important
postcolonial questions hinging on the distinction between the different
kind of discursive relations that Anderson emphasises, and those that I
have tried to track above.

Anderson argues that

it is not an issue of extending humanity to ... negatively racialised
people, but of putting into question that from which such people have
been excluded -- that which, for liberal discourse, remains
unproblematised. (2007, 199)

I fear, however, that if we direct attention away from histories of
humanism's failure to deal with difference and to render that difference
compatible with its fundamental universalism, and if we overlook its
proponents' failed attempts to combat dispossession, murder and
oppression; if our history of race is instead understood through a
critique of humanity's conceptual separation from nature, we dilute the
political potency of universalism.

[Historically, it was not humanism that gave rise to racial innatism, it
was the specifically anti-humanist politics of settlers forging new
social assemblages through relations of violence on colonial frontiers.
**Settler communities became established social assemblages in their own
right specifically through the rejection of humanist interventions.**
Perhaps, as Edward Said suggested]{.underline}, [we can learn from the
implementation of humanist universalism in practice, and insist on
its *potential* to combat racism, and perhaps we]{.underline} can insist
on the contemporary conceptual hybridisation of human--non-human
entities too[, without necessarily abandoning all the precepts of
humanism]{.underline} (Said 2004; Todorov 2002). [We do not necessarily
need to accord a specific value to the human, separate from and above
nature, in order to make a moral and political case for a fundamental
human universalism that can be wielded strategically against racial
violence.]{.underline}

[Nineteenth century humanitarians' universalism was fundamentally
**conditioned by** their belief that British culture stood at the apex
of a hierarchical order of civilisations. From the mid-nineteenth
century through to the mid-twentieth century, this ethnocentrism
produced what Lyotard describes as 'the flattening of differences, or
the demand for a norm ("human nature")']{.underline}, that 'carries with
it its own forms of terror' (cited Braun 2004, 1352). The intervention
of Aboriginal Protection demonstrates that humanist universalism has the
potential to inflict such terror (it was the Protectorate of Aborigines
Office reincarnated that was responsible, later in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, for Aboriginal Australia's Stolen Generation, and
it was the assimilationist vision of the Protectors' equivalents in
Canada that led to the abuses of the Residential Schools system). But we
must not forget that humanism's alternatives, founded upon principles of
difference rather than commonality, have the potential to do the same
and even worse.

In the nineteenth century, Caribbean planters and then emigrant British
settlers emphasised the multiplicity of the human species, the absence
of any universal 'human nature', the incorrigibility of difference, in
their upholding of biological determinism. Their assault on any notion
of a fundamental commonality among human beings has disconcerting points
of intersection with the radical critique of humanism today. The
scientific argument of the nineteenth century that came closest to
post-humanism's insistence on the hybridity of humanity, promising to
'close the ontological gap between human and non-human animals' (Day
2008, 49), was the evolutionary theory of biological descent associated
with Darwin, and yet this theory was adopted in Aotearoa New Zealand and
other colonial sites precisely to legitimate the potential extinction of
other, 'weaker' races in the face of British colonisation on the grounds
of the natural law of a struggle for survival (Stenhouse 1999).

Both the upholding and the rejection of human--nature binaries can thus
result in racially oppressive actions, depending on the contingent
politics of specific social assemblages. Nineteenth century colonial
humanitarians, inspired as they were by an irredeemably ethnocentric and
religiously exclusive form of universalism, at least combatted
exterminatory settler discourses and practices at multiple sites of
empire, and provided spaces on mission and protectorate stations in
which indigenous peoples could be shielded to a very limited extent from
dispossession and murder. They also, unintentionally, reproduced
discourses of a civilising mission and of a universal humanity that
could be deployed by anticolonial nationalists in other sites of empire
that were never invaded to the same extent by settlers, in independence
struggles from the mid-twentieth century. Finally, as Whatmore's
(2002) analysis of the Select Committee on Aborigines reveals, they
provided juridical narratives that are part of the arsenal of weapons
that indigenous peoples can wield in attempts to claim redress and
recompense in a postcolonial world.

[The politics of humanism in practice]{.underline}, [then, was riddled
with contradiction, fraught with particularity and latent with varying
possibilities. It could be *relatively* progressive and liberatory; it
could be dispossessive and culturally genocidal.]{.underline} Within its
repertoire lay potential to combat environmental and biological
determinism and innatism, however, and this should not be forgotten in a
rush to condemn humanism's universalism as well as its anthropocentrism.
It is in the tensions within universalism that the ongoing potential of
an always provisional, self-conscious, flexible and strategic humanism
-- one that now recognises the continuity between the human and the
non-human as well as the power-laden particularities of the male, middle
class, Western human subject -- resides.

In her appraisal of Anderson's work, Nash points to an urgent
contemporary political imperative, concerning the human genome project.
The project provides a resource for strengthening post-humanism's
critique of anthropocentrism, since it has 'confounded ideas of human
genetic distinctiveness and sophistication relative to other animals' by
finding a smaller specifically human genome than expected' (Nash 2008,
465). However, and as in the early nineteenth century, it is not so much
our understanding of human--non-human relations that matters in the
construction of race, but the political uses of the genome project's
findings about variability among humans. As Nash points out,

the narrative of shared human origins 'out of Africa' and accounts of
the genetic unity of humanity are accompanied by a new insistent focus
on the small amount of genetic variation within humanity. The thrust of
this is to supplement the study of the human genome in general with the
study of human genome variation. Most problematically and most
controversially, much of this work is focused on exploring human genetic
variation between those located in the broad conventional categories of
race, or uses racial or ethnic groups in sampling and mapping global
human genetic diversity. So the move to declare the redundancy of race
in light of new knowledge of the human genome has been swiftly followed
by a resurgence of interest in genetic differences between old
categories of race. (2008, 465)

Demarcations between human races thus continue, as a result of the
political entanglements of subordination, inclusion and exclusion,
regardless of evidence about human--nature boundaries. As Saldanha
recognises, given the material, phenotypical basis for ideas of race,
'when understood as an immanent process, it becomes clear that, though
contingent, race cannot be transcended, only understood and rearranged'
(2006, 9). If we are not to use the principle of human universalism,
stripped as far as possible in the light of colonial history of its
colonising prescriptions, to combat persistent innatist demarcations,
however, then what are we to use?

The legacy of humanism may be 'an obstacle, an ideology, a myth'
(Badmington 2004, 1344), and the notion of 'the human' may have to be
redefined contingently and strategically as a moral category rather than
a biological category discrete from the non-human,5 but it may be a
necessary political fiction, providing a resource for the construction
of a new cosmopolitanism (Mignolo 2000), or even, in Fanon's words, a
'new humanism' founded in human immanence rather than transcendence
(Alessandrini 2009; Fanon 1967, 7; Pithouse 2003; Murdoch 2004). We need
a universality of human worth without assuming a universality of either
human biology or culture, and perhaps the best way to achieve this
within a new cosmopolitan humanism is, as Saldanha puts it, not to
'eliminate' race (cf. Gilroy 2000), but to proliferate it -- to direct
its 'many energies''at multiplying racial differences so as to render
them joyfully cacophonic' (Saldanha 2006, 21). The universalism of what
Saldanha calls 'a thousand tiny races' (Saldanha 2006, 21) constituting
humanity may have to exist alongside, and in acknowledged tension with,
the deconstruction of the anthropocentrism that isolates all these races
from 'nature'.

[Postcolonial criticism invites cross-cultural analysis
without]{.underline} demanding extensive [**cultural knowledge**. It
trades in **stereotypes** and the **fantasy** of locating a genuine
anticolonial nationalistic subject grasped through a psychoanalytic
framework that is itself **not culturally specific**]{.underline}
(Harootunian 2002:172). 7 [This lack of specificity has led]{.underline}
some [critics to compare]{.underline} the discourse of [postcolonial
criticism with]{.underline} that of **[colonial thinking]{.underline}**
(Shohat 1992:99). [Postcolonial theory]{.underline} still [orients the
globe according to a **single binary** of Western
historicism]{.underline} (McClintock 1992:85). [It marks and
markets]{.underline} the multitudinous [cultures]{.underline} of the
world [and telescopes their geopolitical distinctions **into
invisibility**]{.underline} (McClintock 1992:86). [One colonial
experience can come to resemble another]{.underline}. The [critics
**indiscriminately embrace the Other** and level out]{.underline} the
[various competing Others]{.underline}. What is important is that [the
Other **always be perceived as correct, regardless of
differences**]{.underline}. It must fulfill the critic's desire for a
pure otherness in pristine luminosity (Chow 1995:45). In this manner,
[postcolonial criticism]{.underline} exhibits a banal Rousseauism that
[privileges non-Western culture and glories in its presumptive eventual
resurgence as it **topples some establishment**]{.underline} (Clark
1996:44).

The most sustained complaint against postcolonial criticism, however, is
that it [claims **historical method without** a grasp of **historical
facts**]{.underline}. As Aijaz Ahmad (1992) has shown, [if you level out
all histories, you can take]{.underline} up [a thousand available
microhistories **arbitrarily** since they all amount more or less to the
same thing]{.underline}. Relying on the experience of modern
colonialism, [the critic divides history into
**manageable**]{.underline} and [**isolated segments**
while]{.underline} at the same time [arguing against]{.underline} the
false [homogenization]{.underline} of Orientalist projects (Bahri
1995:52). Ahmad bewails the postcolonial theorist's denial of history,
especially the histories of peoples, their trajectories of survival, and
their achievements. For example, the "historical" narrative of Said's
Culture and Imperialism is quite abstract, consisting more of textual
commentary and literary history than history, per se . Bhabha even
vaunts the antihistoricism in his rewriting of the nation as narration.
[By mystifying the political effects of Western postmodern **heg**emony,
frameworks]{.underline} such as Bhabha's cult of linguistic and
psychological ambivalence and Spivak's metaphysics of textualism further
**[obscure]{.underline}** the history of **[peoples' resistance to
imperialism]{.underline}**.

[This lack within postcolonial criticism of **any effective historical
consciousness** explains why it]{.underline} has primarily [found urgent
currency in the first world and few ripples resonate in]{.underline} the
excolonized worlds of [South Asia and Africa. The predominance of
critical contestants in Euroamerican centers reflects how much this
theory is **inherently Eurocentric** and **culture bound**]{.underline}
(Clark 1996:24). Critics of postcolonial theory have begun to question
the agendas lurking behind its rhetoric and its complicity with certain
forms of Eurocentric cultural theory (Radhakrishnan 1993:750) and the
power struggles replicated within this critical discourse. [It
is]{.underline}, indeed, [ironic the degree to which postcolonial theory
depends on European cultural theory while]{.underline}, at the same
time, [claiming]{.underline} that [European knowledge can **never
disclose the truth** regarding the colonized]{.underline} (San Juan
2002:259).

Our point of reflection is that [if colonialism was a violent project,
postcolonial]{.underline} and decolonial [encounters]{.underline} also
[unleash **multiple forms of violence**]{.underline}. We have indicated
that [the Western-style, modern nation-state formula **remains
aspirational** for many counter-hegemonic groups, and for regimes that
want to consolidate power]{.underline} (Parashar 2019). [The process
of]{.underline} '[becoming]{.underline}' has **[unleashed its own
structures of violence]{.underline}**. Bina D'Costa and John Braithwaite
(2018) have shown how both [violent actions and]{.underline} violent
[imaginaries **cascade in**]{.underline} many [**postcolonial
societies**. Crime cascades to war, war]{.underline} cascades [to more
war and to crime, and crime and war both cascade to **state violence**
such as **torture, enforced disappearances** and **extrajudicial
execution**]{.underline}. Gerlach (2010) argues that extremely violent
societies are not violent in some cultural or essential way. Instead,
[societies transition in and out of]{.underline} extremely [violent
periods]{.underline} of their histories as a result of crises.

[Violence is not the defining characteristic of any
society]{.underline}; violence is the result of the socialisation and
exchanges embedded in the very nature of colonial encounters and
subsequently in their various legacies, as we explore here. However,
**[we continue to]{.underline}** erase the histories of people and
societies, especially colonialism and imperialism, to [**justify
violence as a contemporary affliction devoid of context**. In much of
the Global South]{.underline}, former colonies and [now post colonies,
it is not possible to understand]{.underline} contemporary
[violence]{.underline} without its antecedents, [without accounting for
colonial continuities and historical legacies]{.underline}. We do not
mean history here in the ordinary, official, disciplinary sense but
histories as the past that lives and the past with which most people
still live, at least in societies not dominated by historical
consciousness, which is often dependent on shared and private memories,
cultures, myths, legends and epics that bypass the historical mode of
reasoning (Nandy 1995). [Violence is]{.underline} not a product but **[a
process]{.underline}** in these societies, [where the]{.underline}
violent [histories of colonialism are **gradually**]{.underline} being
**[erased]{.underline}** out of the analysis of the contemporary
'political'. What [we get]{.underline} are **[poorly articulated
justifications of colonialism]{.underline}**, often [vile expressions of
white fragility and emasculation that masquerade as
informed]{.underline} '[viewpoints]{.underline}' [and
research]{.underline} about a textured and multi-layered past.

The erasure of violence on the Global South was attended to in one of
the recent special issues in Third World Quarterly on 'Violence and
Ordering of the Third World' (Persaud and Kumarakulasingam 2019). The
editors made a powerful case to centre the violence (especially body
counts) that has been a definitive and structurally constitutive factor
in the contact between the West and the Third World, through
colonisation and occupation, and through mimicry practices of
postcolonial states invested in Western modernity and the nation-state
system. States had to be willed into homogeneous, masculine,
geographical entities, denying difference and diversity. As the editors,
Persaud and Kumarakulsingam, postulated in their introduction,

> [Violence in]{.underline} such [colonial contexts has taken multiple

The [silences around these issues were discussed]{.underline} by the
various authors [as an act of **active forgetting** that **privileged
theoretical abstraction**]{.underline}. We take these conversations
further, revisiting the impact of colonialism's violence on postcolonial
politics and development in Africa. The discussions in this volume draw
insights from postcolonial developments and discourses in Cameroon,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra
Leone, South Africa, South Sudan, Togo and Uganda.

### Theory Wrong\-\--Coloniality in IR\-\--2AC

#### 'Coloniality' is neither unifying nor should it serve as a catch-all concept for explaining global oppression.

Doerthe **Rosenow 24**, Lecturer in International Relations at King's

Violence of Settler Imperialism -- and Why the Concept of Coloniality

The concept of 'coloniality' seems to offer the right tool for such an
all-encompassing understanding and analysis, and it might be for that
reason that it is now increasingly used in the social sciences. Similar
to what is going on in the public realm, [academia]{.underline} also
[attempts to come to terms with colonial legacies]{.underline}. Ánibal
Quijano uses the term 'coloniality' to describe the continuities of
global colonial rationalities and practices. 'Coloniality' names a
system of capitalist-colonial expansion that started in the 15th century
with the conquering of the Americas, relying on the creation of an
exploitative global division of labour. This division of labour was
based on and justified through the establishment of a sociocultural,
racialised hierarchy, and went along with the suppression of any
non-capitalist/non-European ways to know and live, on the basis of the
project of 'modernity' at large. 'Coloniality', according to Quijano,
has not ended, as formal colonialism did -- it brought the world as we
know it into being, and continues to hold it in its thrall.3

[Because coloniality makes sense of past and ongoing oppression in
global terms]{.underline}, it seems a particularly apt concept for
International Relations (IR), which, after all, is interested in
understanding the nature of global power. It might be for this reason
that [there is]{.underline} now [an ever-expanding body of IR literature
that uses the term]{.underline}, ranging from simply using coloniality
as a non-distinct descriptor of global colonial relations, to being used
in place of or in addition to terms such as 'race', 'colonialism',
'raciality', 'slavery' or 'Eurocentrism', to those scholars who situate
themselves strongly in the Latin American decolonial tradition
(sometimes even explicitly identifying themselves as 'decolonial'
scholars).4

However, even when coloniality is used in a manner that demonstrates a
strong understanding of its intellectual legacy, [its suitability as
a]{.underline} '[catch-all]{.underline}' [concept]{.underline} that can
describe our global condition at large [is **rarely
interrogated**]{.underline}. As Karen Tucker argues, [there is a danger
that coloniality becomes a way to describe]{.underline} '[systems of
oppression and domination]{.underline}' [as]{.underline}
'**[uniform]{.underline}**' [and]{.underline} '[unitary]{.underline}',
[at the expense of]{.underline} conducting '[**close, detailed
analysis** of the dispersed practices that produce racialized
hierarchies and erasures]{.underline}'.5 In this article, I aim to
demonstrate that [this tendency to describe colonial oppression as
unitary and homogeneous is **inherent in the** way that the **concept**
was designed]{.underline} by Quijano, [and]{.underline} then further
[consolidated by]{.underline} other [decolonial scholars who became key
reference points in IR]{.underline}. As I will show, [this has
problematic consequences, **not only for understanding**]{.underline}
the nature of [**colonial oppression** but **also for the resistance
against it**. Coloniality is grounded in]{.underline} particular
[assumptions that not only **render certain colonial violence
invisible** but are even in danger of **reinforcing that
violence**]{.underline}.

### Theory Wrong\-\--Blue Humanities\-\--2AC

#### 'Blue humanities' get co-opted by the military and can't escape colonial knowledge production.

Australian National University, "The Possibilities of Decolonial Pacific
Studies: Learning from an Oceanic Genealogy of Transformative Academic
Practice," The Australian National University, 2021, accessed
06-28-2025, ProQuest, DG

There is another reason to be careful about specificity: these
[capitalist and militarist interventions]{.underline} in the Pacific
[tend to insidiously **co-opt terminology** and **framings of
expansiveness and fluidity**]{.underline}. Elizabeth DeLoughrey's essay
'Critical Ocean Studies for the Anthropocence' makes this point. In an
argument that cautions those associated with [the]{.underline} 'oceanic
or [blue humanities]{.underline}' -- to which I would add Pacific
studies -- she notes that,

> Fluidity, mobility, adaptability, and flux -- all terms associated
> with neoliberal globalization regimes as well the oceanic or blue
> humanities -- are also key words and strategies of
> twenty-first-century maritime militarism. (DeLoughrey 2019, 25)

In explaining the expansiveness of maritime militarism, DeLoughrey
examines RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific Exercise), a biennial military
exercise conducted by US-allied Pacific Rim nations (Figure 3.9). Though
its headquarters are in US military sites in Hawai‛i, RIMPAC's naval and
air-based weaponry stretch, in an arguably absurdly vast scale, across
the Pacific. DeLoughrey cites a US federal court ruling in 2015 which
noted the 'breathtaking assertion' that the US Navy assumed its right to
access literally all of the Pacific, unlimited by 'time, space, species,
or depth' (DeLoughrey 2019, 31). Its claim to use such vast space to
perform military might is underscored by the fact that the 'US
Indo--Pacific Command,' based in Hawai‛i, claims responsibility for
US-led military operations spanning 100 million square miles (260
million square kilometres), a staggering 'fifty-two percent of the
Earth's surface' (DeLoughrey 2019, 24). The United States military, the
progenitor of colonial occupation of Pacific Islander lands and seas
throughout much of the north Pacific, clearly demonstrates an almost
endless quest for terrestrial and aquatic expansion -- much like the
ever-expanding, land-seeking logics that underscore settler colonialism
(Veracini 2011, 3). A sea of islands, vast and hospitable in the 'Our
Sea of Islands' sense, becomes twisted insidiously to serve militarist
ends (see also Allen et al. 2018).

Indeed, the [conceptual framings]{.underline} of area studies [have
expanded and contracted **precisely** in line with how hegemonic nations
such as the **U**nited **S**tates have perceived their real and desired
spheres of influence]{.underline}. Nowhere is this more relevant than
the Pacific, where capitalism and the arrangement of global alliances
have deigned the liquid zone of the great ocean as one where
'co-prosperity' of rim nations is predicated upon the movement of
capital and ideas through the Pacific, not of the Pacific, considering
it a moving marketplace rather than anything peopled or historied
(Connery 1994; Jolly 2007, 525--26).4 [These arguments remind us to **be
cautious of unquestioned fluidity**, and as who it empowers and who, or
what, it exploits. The threat of co-optation **forever
looms**]{.underline}, as it does with decolonisation itself (Tuck and
Yang 2012).

Pacific studies' decolonial mission of restoring rhetoric,
representative and real power to Pacific Islanders must be wary of such
co-optation. [If notions of place invoke ways of thinking]{.underline}
in Pacific studies, [we tend to celebrate expansive and mobile
approaches to scholarly work through metaphors of the
ocean]{.underline}. For example, in Geoffrey White's introduction to the
anthology of Hau‛ofa's works, he recognises the use of the ocean as 'a
trope for perpetual motion and freedom as well as vastness and depth,'
that Hau‛ofa's Pacific is 'startlingly expansive and inclusive,' and
that the ocean provides 'metaphors that allow for openness and
connection' (G. White 2008). [Such tropes and metaphors are certainly
useful in resisting the constraints placed on bodies and ideas by
enduring settler colonial and neoliberal nation-states]{.underline}, but
[we do a **disservice to those people and knowledges by not also
attending to their particular ways of being, knowing and doing, and we
need specificity of mobility**]{.underline} (like Hau‛ofa's anecdote
about his Tongan friend flying across the Pacific) **[to ward
off]{.underline}** pervasive **[co-opting threats of territory-seeking
capitalism, colonialism and militarism]{.underline}**. In Diaz's keynote
on Milanesian seafaring, he reminds us that the title of 'Our Sea of
Islands' features a sea, not an ocean -- a liminal zone linked to
landmasses, where fluid potentiality meets anchored and rooted edges of
shoreline (see also Kauvaka 2016). He writes that '[some of us, and our
seas, consistently get **washed out by the rush to expansive ideas of
oceanic fluidity**]{.underline}' (Diaz 2018, 25) -- **[an erasure that
does not serve Pacific Islanders wherever they may lay down roots, or
indeed, routes]{.underline}**.

#### Blue humanities as a scholarly body is [insulated from criticism]{.underline} and fails to properly engage with its dissidents.

I will start by saying what I welcomed in Sustaining Seas because the
bulk of this review will be taken up with an analysis of what I found to
be unwelcome. To me, the most important aspect of this collection is the
way it offers an exciting illustration of what a
hands-reaching-across-the-table collaboration between the humanities and
the sciences can look like. The \"Operation Crayweed\" project led by
Australian marine ecologist Adriana Vergės is a model in this regard.
\"If there is a message from major environmental issues such as climate
change it is that scientific evidence in and of itself does not convince
the broader public of the need for action or even caring about the
environment\" (242-43). Several chapters in this collection echo this
point, which is welcome indeed, and for the most part they suggest that
the sciences need to work with artists to produce works of art, stories,
songs and other varieties of art work to engage the \"broader public,\"
about which I can only say that would surely be welcome. However, I
would suggest that [the humanities can do more than make
art]{.underline}, as valuable as that is; [it]{.underline} can also, I
would say [must]{.underline}, **[engage in]{.underline}** what used to
be known as ideologiekritik, which is the process of **[rigorously
examining and]{.underline}** where necessary **[critiquing the concepts,
assumptions, and ideological positions that underpin a given piece of
scholarly work]{.underline}**. We need to unite not just the creative
and the scientific, but also the scientific and the critical, [if we are
to develop]{.underline} the nascent field of the \"[blue
humanities]{.underline}\" [into a genuine field of scholarly
inquiry]{.underline}. I might as well be blunt here and say it is the
critical element that I find lacking in this collection.

It is difficult to respond to any edited collection, particularly one as
richly interdisciplinary as Sustaining Seas, without risking turning it
into a grading exercise in which you single out the papers you like and
the ones you don\'t, or worse, in typical Žižekian fashion, stipulating
which papers are right and which ones are wrong. In the hope of avoiding
that fate, I will instead treat it as multifaceted group project, or if
that still sounds too much like a grading exercise, then as a
collaborative mission. Although the collection as a whole is internally
heterogeneous, particularly with regards to disciplinary background and
disciplinary ways of writing (humanities and social sciences really are
different!), it is remarkably homogeneous with regards the varieties of
modalities of relating to marine life it espouses. This might be
expected of a collection that originated with a conference, so it may
just be an artifact of the self-selecting nature of conferences rather
than a conscious editorial choice. [The absence of debate]{.underline}
in these pages [is noteworthy because many of the positions it adopts
are **problematic**]{.underline}, as I will try to show in what follows;
[it]{.underline} also [seems]{.underline} to be symptomatic of a
systematic [avoidance of the kinds of discourses]{.underline}-Marxism in
particular-[that could not but disrupt the apparent consensus this set
of authors has settled into]{.underline}. One cannot stay with the
trouble as Haraway suggests is necessary in these troubling times if one
is not also prepared to make trouble as I aim to do here.

To my mind, [the most **glaring** and indeed troubling
**absence**]{.underline} in this whole collection **[is any discussion
of capitalism]{.underline}** as a world-system. One might respond by
saying: well you can\'t include everything, not even in a capacious
volume like this. To which I would reply: it is the one thing that
cannot not be included. As Jennifer Telesca writes in her recent book
Red Gold on the demise of the bluefin tuna, it is capitalism as a
world-system, not the practices of fishers, which drives the \"predatory
regime of value\" that is pushing all sea life towards extinction
(Teslsca 2020, 3). As such, [no discussion of the present state of
affairs can legitimately sidestep it]{.underline} as this collection
consistently tries to do [because to do so is to **mistake symptoms for
causes**]{.underline}. I say sidestep because capitalism\'s effects are
frequently acknowledged here but capitalism itself as the motor cause of
history is passed over in silence. [An accusing finger is occasionally
pointed at]{.underline} \"[neoliberalism]{.underline},\" [but it
is]{.underline} largely [treated as though it referred to a lifestyle
choice rather than a way of organising society]{.underline} around a
specific structure of value that is inherently toxic to all life on
earth. In what amounts to a bait and switch move, [this collection
condemns largescale industrial fishing for hoovering up vast quantities
of sea life, only to then turn around and say that things would be fine
if we returned to the small-scale fishing practices of traditional and
indigenous peoples. In this way it **avoids condemning the
system**]{.underline}-i.e., the predatory regime of value of
capitalism-that underpins both large and small-scale forms of fishing.

Old school Marxists would not hesitate to call this way of viewing
things false consciousness and lest this charge seem too harsh let me
run the highlighter pen over a couple of different iterations of it
because it is the plasticity of this idea that is the surest sign of its
ideological function. In the chapter pointedly titled, \"Ocean Regime
Shift,\" South African scholar Lesley Green writes \"Regime-changing
ocean management sciences will not render marine creatures as
extractables but will prioritize the desires of creatures, including
humans, to survive and live well\" (Probyn, Johnston, and Lee 2020, 24).
This argument is consistent with Telecsa\'s position inasmuch as it
challenges the idea that marine life should be regarded as resources to
be profited from, but then Green goes onto say this \"ocean regime
shift\" requires that priority be given to \"the forms of care
articulated by small-scale fishers in the drafting of the small-scale
fisher\'s policy, to overcome the destructive \'thingification\' that
undergirds the conditions leading to an Anthropocene\" (24). It is not
made clear, though, how reorienting fishing policy around the needs and
interests of small-scale fishers would cause us to cease thinking of
fish as \"extractables\" and \"things,\" not least because it encourages
us to continue to think of fish as \"extractables\" and \"things\" for
humans to consume and profit from, providing only that they do so on a
small-scale.

There is a similar tension in Elspeth Probyn\'s chapter \"\'The Sea is
Empty\': Fishers, Migrants, and a Watery Humanism,\" which extends
points made in her monograph Eating the Ocean (2016) that (as the title
indicates) is predicated on the idea that humans can and should eat
fish. Noting that the ocean\'s inhabitants have a \"bleak present and
even bleaker future,\" Probyn nevertheless insists that the charge of
\"overexploitation\" of marine life-a state of being that is nowhere
challenged in this collection-needs to be \"differentiated\" because it
is \"an abstraction that masks the vast differences between small-scale
and the industrial trawlers that comb the seas, often engaged in the
illegal, unregulated, and unreported theft of fish\" (29). As with the
Green example above[, it is not clear what critical purpose]{.underline}
this particular [differentiation would serve because overexploitation is
overexploitation regardless of who is doing the
over-exploiting]{.underline}. We may speculate that if industrial scale
fishing had not emerged in the 1950s that things might be different
today, but we have no way of knowing if that really is the case and the
simple fact is that a fleet of small boats owned by multiple small-scale
fishers is just as capable of depleting the ocean of its living
creatures as large trawlers are, as indeed are indigenous fishers,
albeit at a slower pace, if they are motivated to do so by a growing and
increasingly profitable market.

No mention is made either of the fact that the global population has
almost doubled since the beginning of industrial fishing in the 1950s
making it very unlikely indeed that the old ways would be any better (in
the old days, too, bluefin tuna was sold as cat food, fertilizer, or
just buried as worthless, which is hardly a model of sustainability). In
other words, it is not \"a dumbing down of caring for the ocean\" to
point out that regardless of the \"complexity of relations within and of
the more-than-human marine\" (28), fish stocks are profoundly and
perilously low, as Probyn acknowledges. Overexploitation is not in this
sense an abstraction; it is rather a generalized empirical state of
being-marine life literally has been overexploited by commercial fishers
everywhere - as such we ought to embrace the term as a necessary
starting point.

The \"[real abstraction]{.underline}\" (to borrow Patel and Moore\'s
useful formulation) [is to be found in the implied]{.underline}
\"[lost]{.underline}\" [positive, namely the thoroughly abstract notion
of the]{.underline} \"[right amount]{.underline}\" [of exploitation
which by some mystical process of calculation we should be able to
arrive at]{.underline} (Patel and Moore 2018, 47). Regulatory bodies,
such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas (ICCAT), which Telesca studies, refer to this as the Maximum
Sustainable Yield (MSY) (Telesca 2020, 48-53). The best that can be said
of MSY as a way of thinking about marine life is that despite its highly
complex calculations it nevertheless failed to achieve the one thing it
was supposed to do, namely prevent fish stocks from falling into
decline. This collection dances around this issue, without ever really
finding a landing place that is more concrete than the Orwellian
formulation that largescale fishers are bad and small-scale fishers are
good, which is nothing more than a romanticisation of something that
never existed (humans have always taken as much as they can, it\'s just
that now the capacity to take has reached the species ending level).
Where it is addressed it is generally treated as an issue that can and
should be resolved by policy.

The one paper that addresses regulatory frameworks directly, \"Out of
Sight, Out of Mind: The Challenge of Regulating High Seas Fisheries\" by
Rosemary Rayfuse, gives us little or no cause to think that this is a
viable position. Reviewing the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea
convention, which determines which nations control which parts of the
world\'s oceans, essentially dividing it between coastal zones
controlled by countries whose coast it is and the high seas which are
designated as commons, Rayfuse writes that we now know all the
assumptions underpinning the construction of this document were
\"ill-conceived,\" to which she adds it is now \"a matter of historical
fact that.. .coastal states have by and large failed to properly manage
their fishery resources, resulting in overexploitation\" (Probyn,
Johnston, and Lee 2020, 144-145). Here again, though, no mention is made
of the system driving overexploitation, namely capitalism.

This in turn points us toward another abstraction that really does stand
in need of some fine-grained differentiation: the concept of
sustainability. Surprisingly for a collection with the title Sustaining
Seas, [there is no discussion whatsoever of the problematic nature of
the concept of sustainability]{.underline}, by which I mean no one
questions whether or not the idea is even tenable. I imagine this is
because to do so would be to question whether humans have any business
eating seafood at all. The unstated premise of sustainability is that
humans are \"natural\" predators of the sea with a \"natural\" right to
eat sea creatures and that this can be done in a balanced way (i.e.,
along the same lines that we imagine is true of the relation between
sharks and other fish). For Probyn, whose research grant funded the
conference, human lives and the lives of marine animals are
\"entangled,\" which she defines as meaning something like symbiotic,
with the corresponding implication that humans have a \"natural\" right
to eat marine life because they have always done so. As I have argued
elsewhere, this position is conceptually flawed because while it is
manifestly true that humans cannot live without marine life, not least
because it supplies 70% of the oxygen we breathe, it is doubtful indeed
that marine life would suffer all that much were humans to disappear. As
such, insisting on the entanglement of humans and marine life is really
just a way of legitimating the ethically questionable (to say the least)
position that humans can and should consume marine life to support its
protein needs.

Sustainability is generally treated in this collection as an ideal that
is within reach, if only we could get the governance right. But as this
collection amply documents, to date the governance has been a long way
from right, where right would mean the fair, equitable and sustainable
distribution of a biological resource and not the absolute protection of
vanishing species, which is another category altogether. There are
several key policy disconnects that have been identified. For example,
while Australia rigorously polices catches in its own waters, imported
catches are regulated as food so its sustainability is never questioned
(75). Fish caught in the so-called \"high seas,\" i.e., outside the
jurisdiction of individual nations, are not subject to any enforceable
controls beyond the handshakes and gentleman\'s agreements (as Telesca
calls them) of international NGOs such as ICCAT (143). The governance
systems have tended to be created with large-scale fishers in mind, and
as such they are not fit for purpose for dealing with small-scale
fishers, tending to place upon them an insupportable compliance burden
(185). [The faith that is placed in policy frameworks]{.underline} here
[despite the mounting evidence of policy failures is]{.underline} quite
**[remarkable]{.underline}**, though perfectly consistent with the
findings of policy ethnographers like Tess Lea who show [that is the
default position of]{.underline} almost all policy workers and, lately
of [cultural studies]{.underline}. Indeed, not to think this way is to
be accused of cynicism.2 [It would]{.underline} also [induce a **crisis
of faith** for cultural studies as a field]{.underline}-[if as cultural
studies practitioners we cannot assume that our knowledge-producing work
is contributing to world-changing policy mechanisms, then what in fact
can we believe in?]{.underline} But [such a crisis of faith
is]{.underline} also perhaps **[overdue]{.underline}** because
**[putting one\'s faith in policy in the way cultural studies sometimes
does is to forget]{.underline}**-or least to not sufficiently attend
to-[**the fact that policy is an instrument of power**. To see it as a
perfectible tool for improving the world]{.underline}, as cultural
studies is wont to do, [is not simply naive, it is a category mistake
that **confuses symptom**]{.underline} (**[policy]{.underline}**) **[and
cause]{.underline}** (**[power]{.underline}**).

[Cultural studies has been actively engaged in]{.underline} what might
usefully and justly be termed [a **governmentality
project**]{.underline} (i.e., it has sought to contribute to and further
the aims of governmentality) for the past three decades. The early
advocates of this turn in cultural studies about which Jameson has been
very sharp in his critique, were indeed inspired by Foucault\'s work on
governmentality, but apparently drew the opposite conclusion to Foucault
as to how one should think about policy discourse. Far from freeing
itself from the category as \"subjugated knowledge,\" as Foucault puts
it, [cultural studies has plunged itself deeper into the abyss by
becoming the **willing servant of** the very
thing]{.underline}-**[governmentality]{.underline}**-[it set out to
investigate and it has]{.underline} thereby [contributed to the
**masking of power** with its elaborations of]{.underline} \"[functional
coherences]{.underline}\" [and]{.underline} \"[formal
systematizations]{.underline}\" [of policy frameworks]{.underline}
(Foucault 2003, 7). One cannot but agree here with Jameson\'s appraisal
of [cultural studies use of concepts like]{.underline}
\"[power]{.underline},\" but one could easily add \"policy\" to the
list, it [is]{.underline}, he said, [a]{.underline} \"**[dangerous and
intoxicating slogan for intellectuals, who]{.underline}** thereby
**[feel]{.underline}** themselves **[closer to its \'reality\' than they
may actually be\"]{.underline}** (Jameson 2008, 627). One must ask, what
has the field really gained by hitching its wagon to policy in this way,
as enabler rather than critic? This is obviously not the place to
attempt such an evaluation, but I will say that any such evaluation will
have to be prepared to find that the field got less than the going rate
of thirty pieces of silver for its efforts because it is evident that in
many cases its faith in the policy machine was misplaced.

Telesca\'s work is sobering in this respect because as she demonstrates
in the case of bluefin tuna, the species management policy achieved
precisely what it set out to achieve: the distribution of a biological
asset and the growth of a global industry worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. The coming extinction of the bluefin tuna was not in this sense
a policy failure: the preservation and protection of the bluefin tuna
was never ICCAT\'s actual goal. To even approach ICCAT in terms of its
policy successes and failures is to put oneself inside the belly of the
policy beast. In a striking passage that sums up everything that-in my
view-is missing from Sustaining Seas, Telesca writes:

In the long run, we need to know how common publics, state bureaucrats,
marine scientists, industrial fishers, environmentalists, and a host of
other actors complicit in ICCAT\'s regulatory action are drawn into -
and consent to - the way fisheries management organized by the
nation-state has administered extermination over time for commodity
empires. We must have an account of why people acquiesce to ICCAT\'s
exterminatory regime of value. (Telesca 2020, 39)

Lastly, [one might have imagined that using a word like care to describe
the]{.underline} \"[ideal]{.underline}\" [relation between humans and
marine animals would preclude the former from consuming the latter, but
in fact as this collection reiterates]{.underline} in several places
[the exact opposite]{.underline} is seen to be true: eating marine life
is caring for marine life. Thus, [one must wonder what exactly this new
ocean regime]{.underline} Green calls for [will really mean for the
ocean\'s inhabitants]{.underline}, other than to be \"harvested\" for
profit and protein by small-scale fishers? In what sense is that to be
rendered either non-extractable or de-thingified?

### Theory Wrong\-\--Blue Humanities\-\--Canals

#### It can't account for [canals]{.underline}.

[Oceans roar, streams murmur, brooks babble]{.underline}. But [what
noise does a canal make]{.underline}? what does the voice of the canal
sound like? This is a faintly ridiculous question to ask; but [the
difficulty of answering it is]{.underline}, perhaps,
[telling]{.underline}. To establish a place for the canal within the
blue humanities is to be struck initially by the sense that [the canal
**does not exist and**]{.underline} does not **[operate in ways
analogous to other familiar water bodies]{.underline}**. This might also
go some way to explaining the general silence surrounding canals in the
blue humanities. [The canal is not marked by the same alluring qualities
as other major bodies of water: it is not obviously defined by dramatic
waves, currents, or flows]{.underline} -- at least, not to first
appearances. [Nor are you ever really in the canal]{.underline}
(hopefully), [in contrast to seas and rivers, in whose waters one might
be pleasurably immersed]{.underline}.23 Thus, [humans tend to
be]{.underline} slightly [removed from immediate proximity with canal
waters]{.underline} -- engaging them from the deck of a narrowboat, say,
or via a towpath. [Canals are]{.underline} also [artificial]{.underline}
-- and [this suggests one way in which humans might]{.underline}, in
fact, [be existentially **more proximate to the canal** than
other]{.underline} more seemingly 'natural' [water courses]{.underline}
like rivers or streams. Taken holistically, [it is precisely because of
these differences, because **canals offer ways of doing the blue
humanities differently**, that these inland waterways offer a valuable
contribution to the]{.underline} critical [field]{.underline}.

Psychoanalysis adds another significant dimension here: the reason why
[intersectional identity politics appeals]{.underline} in today's
multicultural world is **[because of the subject's
enjoyment]{.underline}** (jouissance) **[of it]{.underline}** --
enjoyment in Lacanese denoting the excessive pleasure derived from
something to the point of irrationality (Lacan, 1998: 183--4). 4
Accordingly, under a multicultural regime, [the subject is **seduced by
the prospect of** social and political **recognition and
recovery**]{.underline} (Thakur, 2020: xx--xxi; Žižek, 2006: 309).
[Intersectionality's libidinal reward can be seen in]{.underline} a
range of current socio-political occurrences: the (liberal) benevolence
of granting rights and [**rescuing** and rehabilitating **oppressed
voices**; the]{.underline} corresponding **[thrill of being recognized
by claiming identity]{.underline}** or minority rights; **[the self-
righteousness of asserting]{.underline}** one's oppression and
'**[victimhood]{.underline}**'; [and]{.underline}/or **[the narcissism
of acknowledging one's]{.underline}** personal guilt and
**[complicity]{.underline}** in social injustices. Of particular note is
'privilege theory' (Applebaum, 2011; Kimmel and Ferber, 2016), which,
while [bringing attention to privileged subject positions and
complicity]{.underline} in homophobia, patriarchy, or racism,
[can]{.underline} sometimes [create an atmosphere of **surveillance**
and **disciplining**]{.underline} ('privilege checking') [of both self
and other]{.underline}. As Zalloua (2020) notes, [there is]{.underline}
'[a kind of illicit satis- faction]{.underline} -- an unconscious
enjoyment -- not only [in]{.underline} exposing the blind spots \[and\]
. . . **[rhetorical disciplining]{.underline}** of others, but in your
own self-discipline, in your perceived suffering. . . . At its base
level, [privilege theory provides you]{.underline} with [the **fantasy
of intervention and action**; it offers you criticism]{.underline}
([attention to subjective violence]{.underline}) **[without
critique]{.underline}** ([occluding]{.underline} objective \[i.e.
[systemic]{.underline}\] [violence]{.underline})' (pp. 36, 18). [So
invested can people become in identity]{.underline} (their own and that
of others) [that they can get **bogged down in battles over recognition
and self-policing**]{.underline}.

[The libidinal complement]{.underline} to intersectional identity
politics thus [reinforces the culturalization of liberal democratic
politics. **Real social problems**]{.underline} (discrimination,
marginalization, racialization, inequality) **[are pressingly raised,
but]{.underline}** only **[superficially]{.underline}** or partially
[**acted upon**. People enjoy and publicize their critical
self-awareness, their empathy with the oppressed, and their]{.underline}
seemingly [progressive]{.underline} and humanitarian
[politics]{.underline}, but **[without taking any meaningful
action]{.underline}** (**[confronting]{.underline}** the **[systemic
barriers to]{.underline}** inequalities, **[or demanding collective and
material rights]{.underline}**, not simply individual civil and cultural
rights). [We feel good about naming our complicity in global
inequality]{.underline}, or **[we get off on surveilling others' lack of
'political correctness']{.underline}**, but [this only ends up
**reinforcing** the particularity, fragmentation, and depoliticization
that capitalist liberal democracies count on]{.underline}.

[White settler colonial studies has been]{.underline} widely [criticised
for producing a sense of]{.underline} '**[colonial
fatalism]{.underline}**', for [representing settler colonialism
as]{.underline} '**[inevitable]{.underline}**', [and]{.underline} for
[reproducing a]{.underline} '**[teleology of elimination]{.underline}**'
**[of Indigenous lifeworlds]{.underline}**.77 In this section, we
therefore turn to theorise the background against which White settler
colonial studies is produced as a discipline. Wolfe contends that, in
settler colonial contexts, race functions primarily as an 'organizing
grammar' or 'ideology' that may 'obscure the primary historical
relation- ship of invasion'.78 We argue, however, that [White settler
colonial studies takes]{.underline} the [macrological dynamics and
institutionalised frameworks]{.underline} of race [as the **self-evident
background of the settler subject**]{.underline}. White settler colonial
studies is [conditioned by histories of European imperialism and racial
capitalism that **orient White settler standpoints towards White
sovereignty**]{.underline}. From a White settler standpoint, [the
discipline **produces the settler as transhistorical**, and **forecloses
possibilities for action that emerge from Indigenous
sovereignty**]{.underline}.

Wolfe's description of the settler/Indigenous binary is preconditioned
by the naturalised racial difference of British imperialism. Wolfe
argues that the frontier presents the 'primary paradigm' of 'the
historical development of Australian settler-colonisation'.79 The
frontier, for Wolfe, is a performative representation that produces a
primary settler/ Indigenous binary. According to Wolfe, the 'binary
nature of the Native/settler divide is a structural reality of a
zero-sum conflict between two polarised and mutually distinct
parties'.80 In his early work, Wolfe argues that 'retrospectively,
polarity is indisputable -- back from a certain point, there is no
question as to the mutual distinctiveness of the two parties to the
Australian colonial process. The differences within them were smaller
than the differences between them'.81 In response to critics, Wolfe
forcefully repeats this point later in his career:

> the concept of the frontier has the virtue of expressing the protean
> fact of a historical coming together of societies that had previously
> been mutually discrete ... Go back far enough, in other words, and
> there can be no disputing the existence of an unqualified empirical
> binarism.82

Wolfe's [analysis]{.underline} of Australia thereby [assumes the
existence of two pre-given and categorically different entities that
precede the invasion]{.underline}.

[Wolfe theoretically argues]{.underline} that [settler/Indigenous
polarity is]{.underline} '[a **structural relationship rather than an
effect of the will**]{.underline}'.83 As such, he [categorises all
non-Indigenous peoples living on stolen Indigenous land as
settlers]{.underline}. This risks [**overdetermining the position of
non-Indigenous peoples on stolen Indigenous land**, producing a
**settler homogeneity** by locating Black enslaved peoples, forced
migrants of colour, and Indigenous migrants **into the White category of
settler**]{.underline}. Wolfe provides a number of counter-intuitive
examples of settlers. Most contentiously, Wolfe argues that:

> The fact that enslaved peoples immigrated against their will ... does
> not alter the structural fact that their presence, however
> involuntary, was part of the process of Native dispossession.84

Similarly, Wolfe cites the recruitment of Native Peruvians to bolster
the population of Israeli colonies in occupied Palestine, and the
deployment of Native American soldiers in Hawaii as evidence of the
'determinate nature of structural relations' irrespective of the
conditions that motivated their migration.85 British settlers
nevertheless enter Wolfe's analysis as the implicit point of reference
from which the category of settler is theorised. Wolfe justifies his
counter-intuitive stance by comparing enslaved peoples in America and
Indigenous-cum-settlers in Israel and Hawai'i to White settlers in
Australia: 'White convicts came against their will. Does this mean that
their descendants are not settlers?'.86 Wolfe's settler/Indigenous
binary might therefore be rearticulated as a White/Indigenous-race
binary; a White/Black binary in the case of Australia.

Wolfe's [description of the logic of elimination is preconditioned by
naturalised bioeconomic laws of racial capitalism]{.underline}. Wolfe's
[geographical depiction of the frontier]{.underline}, as noted above,
[presents Indigenous-settler relations in terms of a]{.underline}
'**[zero-sum conflict]{.underline}**' over the land.87
[This]{.underline} description of a zero-sum conflict [presents the land
as a finite and scarce resource, **a possession to be secured through**
the **exclusion** of others]{.underline}. Wolfe's description of the
logic of elimination produces a slippage in his work 'between the intent
of settler colonialism and its tangible outcomes, which carry the
implication of extinction'.88 Jean M. O'Brien identifies two examples of
this slippage in Wolfe's Traces of History. First, Wolfe describes
allotment policy in the USA, which aimed to eliminate Native Americans
from the land by requiring that they either move further west or
assimilate into the settler nation by accepting a privatised allotment
of land. Wolfe, however, concludes that those Choctaw people who opted
to stay on their land and take up individual allotments were
successfully transformed into '"homesteaders and American citizens"';
for Wolfe, 'Without the tribe ... for all practical purposes, they were
no longer Indians'.89 Second, Wolfe describes the Indian Reorganization
Act (IRA) of 1934 as a policy that aimed to eliminate Native Americans
by reforming and assimilating them into the settler nation at the level
of the tribe. Wolfe again concludes that those 'reformed tribe\[s\] had
been domesticated' through the reservation system and the 'inassimilable
features of the tribe' eliminated.90 He further concludes that Native
Americans off-reservation were thereby incorporated into the settler
nation as either Black or White, and 'ceased being Indian'.91 In each
example, [Wolfe's account of the logic of elimination slips into a
description of the]{.underline} '[social death of
Nativeness]{.underline}'92 [as an actual outcome of settler colonialism.
By theorising settler colonialism as bioeconomic competition over land,
Wolfe **naturalises the elimination of the Indigenous race** **and their
replacement by the White race**]{.underline}.

Finally, Veracini's description of settler sovereignty is preconditioned
by White possessive logics of both racial capitalism and British
imperialism. Veracini describes settlers as 'founders of political
orders', and a 'sovereign collective';93 a settler body politic is
'self-constituted ... through a foundational sovereign movement across
space'.94 Settlers, for Veracini, 'carry their sovereignty with them'.95
Veracini's [description of sovereignty as something settlers may carry
across space represents settler sovereignty as a White
possession]{.underline}. He details, for example, the corporate
foundations of an 'extensive' list of settler colonial endeavours.96 In
these endeavours, on Veracini's account, the sovereignty of settlers is
a product of the economic capital they carry with them. 'Capitalism',
for Veracini, 'is at the service of settlement'. In another example,
Veracini argues [that all settler colonial endeavours must
have]{.underline} '[the ability to will a collective identity and its
institutions into existence]{.underline}'.97 In other words, settler
bodies can only irrupt into existence if they are able to imagine their
movement to a new location. This [reflects]{.underline}, then, [a public
and psychological wage of British imperialism. Veracini produces
Whiteness as a possession through the construction of migrants
as]{.underline} '[appellants **facing a political order that is already
constituted'**]{.underline}.98 [This]{.underline} construction [risks
**dehumanising migrants** by **erasing their agency** and **presenting
them as chattel or imperial subjects who may be easily**]{.underline}
'**[co-opted within settler colonial political
regimes]{.underline}**'.99 [Racial capitalism and British
imperialism]{.underline} thus [function as the background to settlers'
apparent capacity to carry their sovereignty with them wherever they
go]{.underline}. As such, Veracini concludes that 'sovereign entitlement
... travels with the settler collective'. Whiteness as possession
provides settlers with what Veracini terms a 'crucial marker of settler
substantive sovereignty', the ability of settlers to biopolitically
manage the 'population economy' of their territory.100 Here, Veracini's
[description of settler sovereignty as **substantive, rather than
imagined**]{.underline}, further **[represents Indigenous peoples as if
they are already captured and contained by settler sovereignty. It
reproduces a White fantasy of]{.underline}** '**[ownership of the earth,
forever and ever, Amen!]{.underline}**'

Conclusion

This article has sought to theorise the racialisation of settler
subjects and their practices by locating settlers within global and
transnational histories of European and US imperialism, racial
capitalism, and settler colonialism. It departs from White settler
colonial studies' description of settler colonialism as a 'structure,
not an event', instead using Nakata's Cultural Interface theory to
unsettle settlers' place on sovereign Indigenous land. For Nakata,
Indigenous sovereignty is the starting point of the analysis, not the
object of analysis. Through the analysis of White sovereignty and
settler orientations, we extend Cultural Interface theory to theorise
how [the transhistorical appearance of the settler within White settler
colonial studies is **conditioned by race**]{.underline}. To do so, we
have explored the shape of the White settler standpoints taken up by
both White colonisers and Black American settlers in Liberia, and in
White settler colonial studies itself. We argue that [White settler
colonial studies reproduces the orientation of White settler standpoints
towards White sovereignty, **rendering possibilities that emerge from
Indigenous sovereignty unintelligible**]{.underline}.

Through the analysis of White sovereignty and settler orientations, we
have extended Nakata's work to theorise the conditions that produce
settlers at the Cultural Interface. Situating Du Bois and
Moreton-Robinson in conversation, we have highlighted the theoretical
connections that the analytic of White possessive sovereignty
illuminates. From racial capitalism and chattel slavery, to British
imperialism and settler colonial nations, Du Bois and Moreton-Robinson
theorise Whiteness as a possession performatively accumulated through
the dehumanisation and dispossession of others, and which rationalises
White sovereign ownership of the earth and everything in it. Through the
example of Liberia, we have sought to further map White possessive
logics, illustrating its connections to settler subjectivity.

Building on Ahmed and Rifkin's account of the orientated nature of
settler standpoints, we have argued that [settlers inhabit an
orientation towards White sovereignty]{.underline}. This orientation is
[produced against the background of race]{.underline}, and is [premised
on the elimination of Indigenous sovereignty]{.underline}. We argue that
[**preconceived theories of race** underlie White settler colonial
studies' description of settler colonialism. White settler colonial
studies' accounts of the settler/Indigenous binary, logic of
elimination, and settler sovereignty **present settlers as
transhistorical subjects** by taking the logics of race and White
possessive sovereignty as given. This]{.underline} analysis [deepens the
critiques of White settler colonial studies as a discipline that
presents settler colonialism as an **impenetrable** and **determined
structure**]{.underline}, not to discard White settler colonial studies'
theoretical contributions, but to theorise the preconceived conditions
of race that limit the discipline.

By [restoring Indigenous sovereignty to the foreground]{.underline},
Cultural Interface theory [reveals possibilities]{.underline} that
emerge from [**beyond the limits of White settler colonial studies**. It
suggests]{.underline} that [we might **direct our attention to the
possibilities for decolonisation that already exist**]{.underline}.
Thinking in terms of orientations opens up multiple possibilities shaped
by the direction one faces, **[without abstracting the subject from the
social and political relations in which they are enmeshed and
implicated. It]{.underline}** theoretically **[restores agency to
settlers and non-Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**; it [allows for them
to make decisions to turn away from White sovereignty and reorient
themselves towards Indigenous sovereignty, **without claiming to be
either Indigenous or innocent**]{.underline}. By virtue of their
position on sovereign Indigenous land, [non-Indigenous peoples
may]{.underline} also [be written into another set of
relations]{.underline}, namely [in relation to Indigenous peoples and
their world views]{.underline}.101 To quote Ahmed,

> Depending on which way one turns, different worlds might even come
> into view. If such turns are repeated over time, then bodies acquire
> the very shape of such direction.102

[Ontologies are modes of conceptualising and ordering the world,
providing a means by which we can imagine, explain, live with, and act
upon]{.underline} \'[the world we are and live in]{.underline}\'. They
are sets of concepts and categories that help us identify, assemble,
order, and explain particular entities. Thereby, ontologies are linked
to imaginary worlds but also to concrete practices, as well as to forms
of engagement with these socio-ecological entities. They are
simultaneously of an ethical, social, symbolic, and material nature.
[Ontologies allow us to make sense of]{.underline} socio-ecological
[entities' nature and properties]{.underline}, their [interrelated
constituent parts, and the relationships that give them substance and
meaning]{.underline} (Boelens et al., 2023). Therefore, ontological
constitution and practices include the process of material-political
translation from the imaginary to material becoming.

In our subject case, ontological river imaginaries may become
materialised in concrete infrastructure projects or other
territorialisation endeavours (see Hommes et al., 2022; Manosalvas et
al., 2023). Their [materialisation]{.underline}, however, [never
emerges]{.underline} \'[out of the blue]{.underline}\' [but is
historically and socio-materially rooted in cultural-political
contexts]{.underline}. As Hommes et al. (2022: 3-4) point out, it is
also importantly \"(...) contingent upon a group's ability to mobilize
the necessary political, cultural, intellectual, financial, and/or
physical- coercive power\". Thus, from a Foucauldian perspective,
onto-epistemological struggles go further than mere encounters over
patterned cultural signs, words, language, myths, conceptualisations, or
bodies of meaning. [Onto-epistemological struggles]{.underline}
necessarily include sociotechnical practices and modes of socio- natural
configuration. They [connect knowledge, power, and truth in particular
ways]{.underline}, in order [to achieve and legitimise a certain
disposition of actors, material tools, artefacts, ecologies,
and]{.underline} the human and non- human [relations that sustain
them]{.underline} (Foucault, 1980). Accordingly, river ontological
materialisation projects must be understood as struggles over
imaginaries and the associated identities, subjectivities, and meanings
that concern the wished-for hydrosocial territorial order (Boelens et
al., 2016).

Departing from this notion, [we approach river ontologies
as]{.underline} (conscious and unconscious) Foucauldian [intentions
to]{.underline} \"[tame the wild profusion of existing
things]{.underline}\". This implies that [we need to **challenge
place-based truths** as well as universal **representations that presume
to know the nature of reality**]{.underline}. In the water world, these
can express themselves as, for example, \'modernist H 2O\',
functionalist \'river eco-systems\', \'rivers as intrinsic rights
entities\', or \'rivers as sentient beings\' (e.g. Wilson and Inkster,
2018; Bourguignon, 2023; Flaminio and Reynard, 2023; Turska and Ludwig,
2023; Mosquera-Guerrero and Krueger, 2024). Consequently, beyond
interrogations regarding either \'fiction or reality\', we are
interested in how truth regimes work and how ontological understandings
are mobilised, used, fixed, and devised by dominant and/or subaltern
groups.

In his essay El idioma analítico de John Wilkins, Jorge Luis Borges
(1942) playfully analysed the taxonomy of the world fictitiously taken
from an \"unknown Chinese encyclopaedia\" entitled the Celestial
Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge. Borges (1942: 3) describes the Chinese
encyclopaedia:

> In its remote pages it is written that animals are divided into: (a)
> belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suckling pigs,
> (e) sirens, (f) fabled, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present
> classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very
> fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water
> pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies.

Borges takes a pragmatic approach to the arbitrariness of finding
universal frames for analysing and describing reality: \"(...) [it is
clear that there is **no classification of the universe that is not
arbitrary and full of conjectures**. The reason for this is very simple:
**we do not know what the universe is**]{.underline}\".
[This]{.underline} observation [sets the stage for ontological
constructions amidst diversities and insecurities]{.underline}. \"The
impossibility of penetrating the divine scheme of the universe cannot
stop us from planning human schemes, even though we are aware that they
are provisional\" (Borges 1942: 3).

Foucault deploys the Borgesian joke to analyse, first, how the heart of
the matter is not the strangeness of individual categories, but the
unimaginability of this -- and other -- mode(s) of taxonomic ordering.1
Second, he shows how existing epistemes, ontologies, and systems of
rationality determine our mindset, as well as how knowledge and truth
could be ordered quite differently. The [wonderment about other systems
of thought]{.underline}, as imposed by Borges' fables, [challenges the
limitations of our own mode of thinking]{.underline}. As Descola (2014:
271) elaborates, \"(...) it is time that we endeavour to understand how
they \[[other styles of worlding]{.underline}\] [are composed without
automatic recourse to our own mode of composition]{.underline}; it is
time that we set out to recompose them so as to make them more amenable
to a wider variety of inhabitants, human and nonhuman\" (2014: 279).
Foucault (1980, 1994) emphasises that dominant power/knowledge regimes
often prevent or obliterate alternative ways of thinking and acting. We
therefore have to question our own modes of categorising, organising,
and conceptualising, and the powers that support them.

This makes it essential to consider the frames that claim to know the
\'nature of nature\' -- or in our case the \'nature of rivers\' -- as
relational. These [frames are created, sustained, and transformed in
specific]{.underline} social, technological, and natural
[contexts]{.underline}, which are **[always and necessarily politically
constituted]{.underline}**. Consequently, [river ontologies need to be
seen as construed through ordering modes and models that create a very
specific disposition of things]{.underline}
(nature/technology/humans/non-humans) and the relationships that sustain
and give meaning to them (e.g. Hoogesteger et al., 2016; Rogers and
Crow- Miller, 2017; Aubriot et al., 2017; Paerregaard, 2018; Wilson,
2019; Yates, 2022; Macpherson et al., 2024; O'Donnell et al., 2024;
Rickard and Ludwig, 2024).

Thus, [at the heart of struggles for control over rivers is a struggle
to establish or transform \'socio- natural order(s)\' and the modes of
knowing them]{.underline}, which can be accomplished through the
triangulation of knowledge, power, and truth. [Whenever scientific,
policy, vernacular, or indigenous ontologies and models for
explaining]{.underline} river realities and [water worlds are portrayed
as \'real\']{.underline} (rather than entrances to imagining the real),
[the power-laden ordering agreements, choices, interpretations, and
meanings are concealed and naturalised]{.underline}. This, we highlight,
is highly problematic, as it veils the intrinsically political character
of these ontologies.

The important contribution of the more-than-human, ecocentric, and
de-colonising perspectives is that they demonstrate precisely the
political and social character of the water world's material,
ontological, and epistemological constructions. They show how a
distinction between nature and society is a deeply political construct
and how misrecognising this (in mainstream academia, policy formulation,
\'development\' interventions, and public discourse) in and of itself is
a fundamentally political act that suffocates other representations
(e.g. Blaser, 2013; Escobar, 2018; Kothari et al., 2019). Therefore, our
critique is not directed at how [ontological turn theorists]{.underline}
have helped to break open the mono-ontological fixes. Quite the
opposite! Instead, we question how much of their [application in
everyday policy]{.underline}, including activist debates, globalising
policy discourses, and popularised alternative approaches [may in fact
attempt to **re-fix ontologies, re-naturalise the society/nature
distinction, and de-politicise nature framings**]{.underline} (see also
Bessire and Bond, 2014; Rawson and Mansfield, 2018). We elaborate this
below through the identification of five distinct fields of contention
in new ontological turns, as expressed in river debates.

### Theory Wrong\-\--Posthumanism\-\--2AC

#### Posthumanist critiques of humanism aren't mutually exclusive with contingent embrace of its benefits. 

Guillermo Díaz de **Liaño &** Manuel **Fernández-Götz 21**, Field
Archaeologist at the AOC Archaeology Group, Ph.D. in Archaeology from
the University of Edinburgh; Professor of Later European Prehistory at
St. Cross College, University of Oxford, Ph.D. from Christian-Albrecht
University Kiel, "Posthumanism, New Humanism and Beyond," Cambridge

We believe that a [complete rejection of Humanism is **unproductive**
and potentially **dangerous**]{.underline}. To start with,
[critics]{.underline} of Humanism [should acknowledge that this term
**does not designate a homogeneous concept**]{.underline}. Fassin
(2019), for example, distinguishes three major lineages in its
genealogy, which he designates as Humanism I, II and III. [As
Posthumanism is an umbrella term that encompasses multiple approaches,
**so too is Humanism**: neither]{.underline} of them [should be
oversimplified or disregarded]{.underline} in their entirety. Although
the [complete rejection of]{.underline} core elements of [the Western
world]{.underline} (e.g. Humanism, Modernity) [might sound appealing in
an academic world that]{.underline} often **[fetishizes theoretical
'newness']{.underline}** (Ribeiro 2016b), [novel reflexive critiques
could]{.underline} often [benefit from integrating elements of
Modernity's legacy of knowledge and experience]{.underline}
(Criado-Boado 2016, 157; Preucel, this volume).

It is worth keeping in mind that posthumanist perspectives are
reflecting wider trends in society that are inextricably linked to the
rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnology, which
are in the course of diluting the boundaries between humans and
non-humans in ways that we can still not fully comprehend (Barrat 2013;
Lanier 2014; Wolff 2017). Moreover, [the rise of Posthumanism is taking
place at the same time that the Humanities are increasingly under
attack]{.underline} on a global scale, with dramatic cuts in funding and
reduced social appreciation, which poses a direct threat to critical
thinking and, ultimately, democracy (Nussbaum 2010; Trepanier 2018).
While heading into an unknown future, perhaps [we should keep in mind
some of the core values of Humanism in a **philosophical** and **ethical
sense**]{.underline} (e.g. Wolff 2010; 2017; Zuboff 2019).

Thus, [instead of rejecting Humanism]{.underline} altogether [and
**throwing the baby out with the bathwater**, it is worth reflecting on
the call for a New Humanism]{.underline} that has recently been proposed
in philosophical anthropology by authors such as Wentzer and Mattingly
(2018) and Simonsen (2012). According to their perspective, this would
imply an approach that

> is [not committed to religious or metaphysical claims concerning human
> essence or human superiority]{.underline}. It does not appeal to a
> secular antireligious cultural movement, nor to a developmental stage
> in (Western-dominated) human civilization. Rather, our proposal marks
> a commitment to deal with 'the human' as a common and indispensable
> denominator for the ontological and ethical domains of anthropology
> and adjacent disciplines. (Wentzer & Mattingly 2018, 146)

Viewed from this angle, [New Humanism is both a critique of some of the
dangers of traditional Humanism, and also a call for caring about humans
in a world increasingly facing dehumanization]{.underline} (Porpora
2017), [while]{.underline} at the same time [committing to global
sustainability]{.underline} (Bokova 2010; D'Orville 2015).

In what concerns archaeology, [we argue for an approach]{.underline}
that is [focused on the study of the human past, not]{.underline} in
order [to reinforce obsolete notions of]{.underline}
'[superiority]{.underline}' [or]{.underline} '[progress]{.underline}',
[but to understand the **non-linear, multivocal and multifaceted
diversity of human experiences**]{.underline} in time and space **[and
its interrelatedness with non-human entities]{.underline}**. We consider
that [the presence of the human is an **imperative**]{.underline} if we
are doing archaeology, [but we understand that humanness is constituted
and performed differently]{.underline} through time and space, thus
[including a diverse and changing array of non-human entities and
relationships]{.underline}. Archaeology, from this perspective, is not
the 'discipline of things', but rather the study of humans through
things and in relation to things.

Grasping the complexity and diversity of the past requires a variety of
theoretical approaches and viewpoints, and most archaeologists already
employ a range of perspectives to achieve this. [**Fluid approaches**

### No Root Cause\-\--Imperialism\-\--2AC

#### Saying Western imperialism is the root of all evil sanctions violence by both Western and non-Western actors.

Postcolonialism added to this critique its own universal based on
Orientalist criticism: **[Western imperialism is always to
blame]{.underline}**. As Edward Rothstein opined in the New York Times,
[any act against the West by a postcolonial power cannot be viewed as
anything but a **reaction** to a previous imperial act by the West. We
cannot]{.underline} then [condemn the World Trade Center attack, since
Western hegemonic behavior is the]{.underline} fundamental [cause of
terrorism, and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, against which
this act was directed, [is the most powerful Western hegemonic
power]{.underline}. The rhetoric of postcolonialism and its call for
[the rule of relativism enabled us to **blame the victim** and **justify
terror**]{.underline}. Rothstein, a mere journalist, questioned whether
such relativism should play any role in the face of destruction that
called for a \"transcendent ethical perspective\" (Rothstein 2001). We,
as readers of recent literary criticism, are usually far removed from
such moral concerns. In fact, we might even find the logic in play here
commonplace and conventional. What could be a more disturbing indictment
of the state of theory today?

The [Occidentalist rhetoric]{.underline} exhibited in these responses
reflects the school of thought that [views the **U**nited **S**tates as
the **source of all evils**]{.underline} ([from the price of beef in
France to AIDS in Africa]{.underline}). This world vision offers certain
advantages. For one, [it allows some countries **to avoid accepting
responsibility for their actions**]{.underline} (Revel 2003:61). [By
attributing **all moral failings** and **grotesque intellectual errors**
to the **U**nited **S**tates as the **monster scapegoat**]{.underline},
certain [nations can **absolve themselves** of their own moral errors
and mistakes. If America becomes **the Great Satan, all the little
Satans pale in comparison**. America can]{.underline} thus exist to
[console]{.underline} Europe and [the world for its own
failures]{.underline} (Revel 2003: 158---59) [among which we can count
its **complacency and**]{.underline} indulgent [**complicity
in**]{.underline} Communist and post-Communist
**[genocides]{.underline}**.

I've said I want to speak a word of black life; and no one has cleared
more theoretical ground for such a word, and so, for the skewed study of
black life as a genuine largeness, than Fred Moten. While certainly no
stranger to black death or antiblackness, Moten's black study is a party
more often than it isn't. He makes the bias of his black study plain
when he outlines his desire in Black and Blur to "subordinate by a
measure so small that it constitutes measure's eclipse, the critical
analysis of anti-blackness to the celebratory analysis of
blackness."Footnote49 Jared Sexton once heard Moten state "measure's
eclipse" numerically, detailing in "The Social Life of Social Death" how
[Moten]{.underline} once "[remarked to the effect]{.underline} that [he
always wants his writing to be comprised of 49.99% critique and 50.01%
celebration]{.underline}."Footnote50 [This delineation of black study
into the "celebration of blackness" and the "critique of anti-blackness"
yields another compelling example of black ambivalence]{.underline}. And
just as we observed of the cooperation between the testaments of black
life and death in Sharpe's black study[, the "critique of
anti-blackness" and "celebration of blackness" are]{.underline}, for
Moten, [not oppositional, but complementary operations that combine to
**produce black study**]{.underline}. Thus, he explains that the "rich,
rigorous, powerful, and utterly necessary analytic of anti-blackness"
actually enables the celebration of blackness; and that this
celebration, in turn, is "done not to avoid or ameliorate the hard
truths of anti-blackness but in the service of its violent
eradication."Footnote51

This delineation of black study offers a framework that bonds the
witness of our forked-tongued tradition together. But beyond serving as
just another example of black ambivalence, the subordination of critique
to celebration in Moten's black study also raises important questions
about the nature of the relationship between blackness and
anti-blackness. That there could be even marginally more blackness to
celebrate than antiblackness to critique pulls blackness out from under
anti-'s totalizing shadow. It leads us to question whether
"anti-blackness" is the first, only, and exhaustive word of black study,
whether the only blackness to speak of is that which gathers under
anti-'s orthographic shadow. When we take part in "the devotional
practice that is given in recitation of the sentence 'blackness is x,'"
have we been misspelling blackness?Footnote52 Leaving out a silent
"anti-"? Is there any word we can speak for blackness that does not
always already presume this prefix, which is nothing but the grammatical
sign of blackness' existence within what Frank Wilderson has theorized
as a broader "grammar of suffering"?Footnote53 [Does blackness have any
life outside of the anti-black "world]{.underline} that was going to
kill" Equiano?

Of course, in .02%, we are talking about a black lining thinner than
silver's. But razor thin as it is, its sheer excess is enough to put
significant pressure on the understanding of antiblackness as that which
"precedes and exceeds" blackness. It introduces the possibility that
this apparent relation can, by another frame, appear inverted, such that
[blackness rather "**precedes and exceeds**" anti-blackness, and is
**not diminished** by anti-blackness' capacity to occlude. By
establishing blackness]{.underline} (and by extension black life) [as
excessive, the .02% margin by which Moten subordinates the "critique of
anti-blackness" to the "celebration of blackness" models and
invites]{.underline} such [ambivalence as is **ultimately skewed** in
the direction of black life]{.underline}.Footnote54 But what grounds are
there to justify this sense of "the largeness that is black life?" And
are they quite so substantial as that which the antiblack world
furnishes to the thought of black death?

Perhaps [we can pursue the grounds of .02%]{.underline} in the nearly
nothing interval of "soon" that elapses between Equiano's initial
"astonishment" at the sight of an unknown ocean and his "terror" upon
boarding the slave ship.

> The first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the coast was
> the sea, and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and
> waiting for its cargo. These filled me with astonishment, which was
> soon converted into terror when I was carried on board. I was
> immediately handled and tossed up to see if I were sound by some of
> the crew; and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of
> bad spirits, and that they were going to kill me.Footnote55

Notwithstanding the terror of the antiblack world that was going to kill
him, I am struck that the very "first thing that saluted" Equiano, even
prior to the slave ship, was the sea. And that when he saw it, he was
astonished. That this astonishment was "soon converted to terror," in a
conversion which mirrors Equiano's own conversion into cargo---and thus,
the Black subject of the nonhuman hold---suggests an interval so short
as to be almost negligible. Especially when considered beside the sheer
scale of the antiblack world, and all there is proportionally to say
about something on the scale of a world when held up against a moment,
here and already gone. The agenda for black study that Equiano's record
of the beginning would seem to set is the study, critique, and
overturning of this world. And I am certainly about that life. But here
is where I stumble, felled perhaps too long in the passing interval of
"soon." It's Equiano's "astonishment" that gets me, again and again and
always. That there was, that there could be, astonishment. Then, in the
time of astonishment, for a moment, but only for a moment, the Earth
gathers, dancing.

Equiano did not jump to see the Earth before the end of his world and
the beginning of ours. But he did see it. And he was astonished. Just
prior to being "saluted," or hailed in the Althusserian sense, by the
slave ship---"Hey you there! Hey, cargo!"---to discovering that he
really was the cargo for which the ship was waiting, and in this way
being interpellated as black, Equiano was greeted by the blue face of an
overwhelmingly blue planet. What if, compelled by such astonishment, we
fall deep into the fleeting interval of soon? What would it mean to
think the dawning of blackness in Middle Passage as not reducible to the
"social death" hailed in the salute of the slave ship? What if, instead,
we think blackness as not just responding also, but first, to the
hailing waves of the astonishing sea? "Hey you there! Hey, earthling."
What if, as our original antiphony, blackness dawns in the ongoing
response of black ecological life to the hail of a blue planet?

[The study of black life as a genuine largeness begins when
we]{.underline}, with Equiano and an innumerable cloud of witnesses,
[stop to **behold the Earth before the end of the antiblack
world**]{.underline}. [This Earth still hails and is hardly as much
world as it appears on its surface]{.underline}, which is so much more
ocean than not. Or else do we suppose that whiteness has managed to
straightjacket the planet so utterly that its definition is no longer
possibility, as the narrator of Invisible Man once averred?Footnote56

If, as Ed Roberson explains, the "nature poem occurs when an
individual's sense of the larger Earth enters into the world of human
knowledge," and if the "main understanding that results from this
encounter is...that the world's desires do not run the Earth, but the
Earth does run the world,"Footnote57 then what would it mean for a
larger sense of the Earth to enter black studies? Or, to invoke a
beautiful line of Roberson's poetry that I can't stop thinking about,
how might we endeavor, "to see the Earth before the end of the
\[antiblack\] world?"Footnote58 And what would happen to our
understandings of black life as that which is insisted from the
totalizing grounds of black death, if we shift our critical frame from
the world to the Earth, as our era of climate crisis seems to demand?
Indeed, [if by "social death," black studies]{.underline} has [arrived
at its most complete understanding of what it means to be black in and
relative to the world, it is yet left to the field to attend ever more
robustly to what it means to be **black on and in relationship to the
Earth, that exceeds the world**. The necessity of this vector of black
study is all the more apparent in the light of]{.underline} a [**global
ecological crisis** that has illuminated the]{.underline} (Human)
[social **life of the world as a still deeper death**]{.underline}. So,
[if what we want is not only apocalypse, but an apocalypse we might live
in, then **even more than social death, we must learn to study and
celebrate what**]{.underline}, by another frame, **[can be perceived as
the largeness that is black ecological life. Because after the end of
the world, there will be black people on Earth, or none at
all]{.underline}**.

### No Impact\-\--Humanism\-\--2AC

#### The 'human' is not collapsing, and posthumanism is conceptually useless.

Simon **Susen 22**, Professor of Sociology at City St. George's,
University of London, Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge,
"Reflections on the (Post-)Human Condition: Towards New Forms of
Engagement with the World?", Social Epistemology, Vol. 36, No. 1, 2022,

Given that Braidotti remains firmly embedded in a poststructuralist
framework, it is far from clear why she wishes to hold on to the concept
of 'the subject'. Granted, owing to the Foucauldian presuppositions
underpinning her approach, [it makes sense]{.underline} for her [to
advocate a posthumanist]{.underline} and post-anthropocentric
[conception of]{.underline} '[subjectivity]{.underline}'. Indeed, as she
affirms, '\[b\]y "posthumanizing" subjectivity, it can be re-positioned
as a dynamic convergence phenomenon across the contradictions of
posthumanism and post-anthropocentrism'.240 Thus, subjectivity exists
within a spatiotemporally contingent field of tensions. More
specifically, '[posthuman subjectivity]{.underline}'241 can be conceived
of as 'a process of becoming in its own immanence and not in binary
oppositional terms'.242 It [is in a **permanent state of
flux**]{.underline}, and [its multilayered constitution does not follow
a binary, let alone monolithic, logic of functioning]{.underline}. At
the same time, it is irreducible to the 'Homo Universalis of
Humanism'243 and the 'Anthropos of anthropocentrism',244 since it is 'a
structural relational capacity'245 that defies the rigid logic of a
fixed sense of 'human nature' or 'human essence'. For Braidotti,
subjectivity is 'both post-personal and pre-individual',246 in that it
finds itself situated in a dynamic, and largely unpredictable, process
of 'constant negotiation with multiple others and immersed in the
conditions that it is trying to understand and modify, if not
overturn'.247 On this view, amo[ng the key features of human
subjectivity are malleability, negotiability, unpredictability,
multiplicity, contingency, and]{.underline} -- above all --
[relationality]{.underline}.

A noteworthy problem with this account of subjectivity, however, is
that, [despite its advocate's **nominally anti-essentialist stance**, it
**relies on effectively essentialist**]{.underline} -- or at least
quasi-essentialist -- **[assumptions about]{.underline}** the very
nature of **[what it means to be]{.underline}**
'**[human]{.underline}**'. For the aforementioned charac[teristics are
**constitutive elements of any human creature**]{.underline} -- that is,
they are traits that are inherent in our species-specific condition.

[This reflection takes us to]{.underline} Braidotti's conception of
'[the subject]{.underline}' [in general]{.underline} and her conception
of 'the posthuman subject' in particular. She maintains that
'\[p\]osthuman subjects are a work-in- progress'248 and that,
furthermore, 'they emerge as both a critical and a creative project
[within the posthuman convergence]{.underline} along posthumanist and
post-anthropocentric axes of interrogation'.249 One may legitimately
object, however, that at least the first part of this statement applies
not only to (post-)human but also to non-human subjects. [By definition,
all living beings are]{.underline} '[a work-in-progress]{.underline}',
[in]{.underline} the sense [that they are **constantly developing
and**]{.underline}, as spatiotemporally situated beings, [responding to
different, and incessantly evolving, environments and historical
circumstances]{.underline}.

This leads us to another issue, namely the question of 'we'. Who are
'we'?250 Braidotti claims that posthuman subjects 'explore the
multifaceted and differential nature of the collective "we"'.251 In
other words, the 'we' to which she is referring cannot be reduced to a
monolithic, let alone transcendental, entity; rather, given its
relational constitution, we are dealing with a multilayered and highly
differentiated form of 'we', whose posthuman constitution is indicative
of the posthuman era. According to Braidotti, '"\[w\]e" are in the
process of becoming posthumanist and post- anthropocentric'.252 We do so
as embodied and embedded selves, since 'we are deeply steeped in the
material world'253; and we do so as transversal selves, since 'we
connect \[with\] but also differ from each other'.254 Bonded by our
'ontological relationality',255 we are -- in vitalist terms --
'variations on a common matter'.256 Yet, paradoxically, 'we differ from
each other all the more as we co-define ourselves within the same living
matter -- environmentally, socially, and relationally'.257 [Just as we
share our ontological relationality with all other living beings, we
differ from each other due to our context-dependent
specificities]{.underline}.

One of the main problems with this approach, however, is that [the
notion of]{.underline} '[we]{.underline}' that lies at its core [is both
**vague** and **presumptuous**]{.underline}: it is vague because [it is
not clear whether it comprises all or only some living
beings]{.underline}; at the same time, [it is presumptuous because the
contention that we are all in the process of becoming
posthumanist]{.underline} and post-anthropocentric [is **far-fetched**.
If we include non-human agents]{.underline} in our definition of 'the
subject', then [the question arises whether all]{.underline} zoe-based
[beings]{.underline} (including animals, seeds, cells, and plants) --
and, indeed, all geo- and techno-based forms of existence -- [can be
included]{.underline} in this category. If the answer is 'yes', then we
are faced with an inflationary conception of 'the subject', which, owing
to its denotative elasticity, fails to do justice to the
species-constitutive distinctiveness of human life.

Of course, one may come to Braidotti's defence by insisting that one of
the principal aims of her project is to undo the boundaries between
different kinds of 'subject' and 'subjectivity' (notably 'human',
'inhuman', 'posthuman', and 'non-human') and that, in some instances,
the 'we' she envisages is more or less clearly defined.258 After all,
she urges us to 'think of ourselves as planetary subjects, rather than
as global agents'.259 Crucially, the types of subject she has in mind
include both 'the human and \[the\] inhuman inhabitants of this
planet'.260 [If]{.underline}, however, [we]{.underline} -- effectively
-- [include **every form of existence**]{.underline} (that is,
'[human']{.underline}, '[inhuman']{.underline},
'[posthuman']{.underline}, [and 'non-human']{.underline}) in our
definition of 'subject' and 'subjectivity', then [these terms **lose
conceptual force**, since, in an omni-onto-epistemological fashion,
**they refer to everything and nothing**]{.underline}.

[Even if]{.underline}, in a narrow sense, [we reserve the]{.underline}
concept of 'the [subject]{.underline}' [for members of our species, it
seems erroneous to assume that all human beings are]{.underline} going
through the process of [being converted into posthuman(ist)]{.underline}
and/or post-anthropocentric [actors]{.underline}. Ironically, the
intersectional divisions to which Braidotti rightly draws her readers'
attention are the very reason that -- to use a modified version of an
Orwellian aphorism -- some human actors are more (or less)
posthuman(ist) and/or post-anthropocentric than others. [Human actors
are **divided by key sociological variables**]{.underline} ([such as
class, ethnicity, gender, age, and 'ability']{.underline}). [Our
position in the world, including our access to socially relevant
resources, is **shaped by these variables**]{.underline}. Braidotti's
[critical theory]{.underline} of society [needs to emphasize the fact
that the degree to which actors have]{.underline} ([or have
not]{.underline}) [become posthuman(ist)]{.underline} and/or
post-anthropocentric [**depends on** the **social positions** they
occupy and the social dispositions they acquire within the social
universe. Otherwise, the]{.underline} bold [proposition that we have
been witnessing the rise of 'a new collective subject]{.underline}, a
"we-are-(all)-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the- same" kind of
subject',261 [is **of merely rhetorical, rather than substantive,
relevance**]{.underline}.

## Alternative

### Alt Fails\-\--Decoloniality\-\--2AC

#### The alternative's epistemic focus fails\-\--it uncritically embraces non-Western ideas and re-orients histories around overly romanticized notions of colonial struggle at the expense of meaningful emancipation.

[Decoloniality tends to approach contemporary politics in **stark,
black-and-white terms**]{.underline}, broadly [rejecting Western
modernity, while **valorizing decolonial**]{.underline} (and especially
Global South and subaltern) **[ways of knowing and
living]{.underline}**. For Mignolo (2007), on whose work I focus here,
the geo-political location of knowledge and identity matters (p. 469).
This is because, for him, European modernity has been coercively imposed
on the rest of the world as universal panacea (Mignolo, 2018: xii). His
goal, instead, is to retrieve a 'pluriverse' of decolonized subaltern
epistemologies.

Central to Mignolo's viewpoint is Quijano's (2000, 2007) notion of
'coloniality of power' -- the systematic application of material,
epistemic, and aesthetic resources needed to ensure empire. Here
[coloniality is seen as continuing]{.underline} in the former colonies
[even after]{.underline} their [political independence, manifesting as
the pervasiveness of Eurocentric knowledge systems and]{.underline}
continuing [patterns of racial oppression and socioeconomic
exploitation]{.underline}. For Mignolo, coloniality cannot be separated
from Western modernity; both are co-constitutive: '"modernity" is a
complex narrative . . . that builds Western civilization by celebrating
its achievements while hiding at the same time its darker side,
"coloniality". Coloniality . . . is constitutive of modernity -- there
is no modernity without coloniality' (Mignolo, 2011: 2--3). The
(post)colonial subject is accordingly only peripherally incorporated
into the Euro-North American metropole, with subaltern epistemologies
either wiped out or classified as 'underdeveloped' in relation to
European norms (Mignolo, 2012: xxv).

In response, Mignolo (2011) advocates for 'epistemic disobedience and
delinking from the colonial matrix in order to open up decolonial
options' (pp. 9, 54). His aim is decolonizing the colonial subject's
imaginary by fracturing 'the hegemony of knowledge and understanding
that have been ruled, since the fifteenth century . . . \[by\] the
theological and ego-logical politics of knowledge and understanding'
(Mignolo, 2010: 313). For him, this epistemological shift will help
transform both the terms and the content of the coloniality/modernity
matrix. Mignolo draws on Anzaldúa (1987) to argue for 'border thinking',
through which suppressed subaltern cosmologies are transformed into
resources for constructing 'alternatives to modernity' (Mignolo, 2010:
320, 2011: xxviii, 2012: 12, 157).

It is such epistemological delinking that, according to Mignolo, will
help produce decolonial 'pluriversality'. Here he borrows the well-known
Zapatista motto of creating '"another world" in which many worlds will
co-exist' to make the case for a planet of multiple co-existing
ontologies and temporalities. The idea is to enable, not a single global
future dictated by the West, but plural ones in which decoloniality
would be one option among others, including what he names as
'Rewesternization' (through which Western powers attempt to maintain
their declining global political-economic power) and 'Dewesternization'
(through which 'emerging powers' challenge Western hegemony) (Mignolo,
2011: 27--35).

A Politics of Authenticity and Disavowal

There is much to learn from decoloniality -- from its multi-dimensional
analysis of coloniality, to its critique of Western modernity and its
prescriptions for decolonizing the colonial matrix. But Mignolo's
[analysis inclines toward **romanticizing decolonial
spaces**]{.underline}. He [has]{.underline} almost [**nothing critical
to say** about the subaltern]{.underline}/Global South; [it is as though
they are somehow **immune to contradiction, failure, or
disagreement**]{.underline} (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 96--9).

[This is evident in]{.underline} Mignolo's [reliance on **simplified**
and **intransigent binaries**]{.underline} such as when he pits
[Western]{.underline} '[imperial]{.underline}' [universalism against
decolonial pluriversality]{.underline}, which for him is invariably
'convivial, dialogical, or plurilogical . . . decolonial and communal
personalities are driven by the search for love, conviviality, and
harmony' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv; see also Mignolo, 2011: 313). It is
also evident in the work of the Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality
research programme, a collective Latin America- focused research project
of which both Mignolo and Arturo Escobar are part. The project
prioritizes 'non-Eurocentric' forms of living/knowledge rooted in such
communities as the Zapatistas in Mexico, Indigenous groups in Ecuador
and Bolivia, and Afro-Latinx movements in Colombia (Asher, 2013: 838;
see also Escobar, 2020: 84--96, 120--35; Mignolo, 2011: 11, 213--51).
Yet when Mignolo applauds, for example, the Zapatistas for their
participatory politics and collective consensus-making, he appears to
ignore that [consensus-based politics can coerce single decisions on
communities]{.underline}, often [suppressing subaltern
voices]{.underline} (Kapoor, 2008: 107--8, 2020: 147--69; see Rancière,
1999). [When Mignolo praises Indigenous communities, he
ignores]{.underline}, for instance, [the **cooptation of Indigenous
leaders** by the Ecuadorean state]{.underline}, the Morales regime's
backtracking on commitments to Indigenous self-determination to appease
capitalist extraction, [**ideological divisions** between and among
Indigenous groups]{.underline} across North, South, and Central America,
or the anti-Muslim politics of sections of adivasi (Aboriginal)
communities in India in collaboration with right-wing Hindu
supremacists: '[What is absent]{.underline} in Mignolo's representations
of the subaltern [are the warnings by]{.underline} the likes of [Freire
and Fanon about the possibility of **internalized subaltern oppression,
racism, and co-optation**]{.underline} (which is ironic, given that
Fanon is one of Mignolo's key decolonial exemplars)' (Kapoor and
Zalloua, 2022: 96; see also Baviskar, 2007; Merino, 2016).

The extent of such an indiscriminate politics of
authenticity/romanticization is to be gleaned in Mignolo's recent
endorsement of a book from a right-wing Hindu author (Deepak, 2021) who
deploys decolonial arguments to make the case for a return to a Hindu
(Brahmanical) epistemology. After a public outcry, Mignolo eventually
withdrew his endorsement, 8 but his willingness to uncritically embrace
a Hindu nationalist politics just because it is disparaging of Western
epistemology and aims at retrieving an 'Indigenous' Hindu cosmology is
revealing of the decolonial tendency to embrace putatively 'authentic'
Global South spaces even if they are elitist or oppressive.

What is conspicuously missing in Mignolo's decolonial position is the
dimension of the Real, the imminent blockage that prevents any
discursive formation -- whether capitalist, post-capitalist, or
pluriversal -- from actualizing its identity. As Crenshaw does with
intersectional identity, Mignolo appears to so revel in the jouissance
of the subaltern/Global South space that he is blind to -- disavows --
social contradictions. Hence his [resort to an authentic pluriversality
devoid of imperfections]{.underline}: a space [where]{.underline}, as
Michaelsen and Shershow (2007) underline in their analysis of his work
(p. 53), [there is de facto consensus and agreement]{.underline}, indeed
[not even the need to criticize, debate, or deliberate]{.underline}.
This [appears as the **textbook definition of ideology**]{.underline} --
**[the erasure of the political, the covering over of social
antagonism]{.underline}** (Žižek, 1989: 25).

The accompanying proclivity is that [the production of an authentic
Global South subaltern space ends up militating against the putative
political subject of decoloniality]{.underline} -- [the
subaltern]{.underline}. In this regard, echoing Spivak (1988), Asher
(2013: 838--9) suggests that [Mignolo and his decoloniality peers
are]{.underline} '[turning to subaltern knowledge to
fulfill]{.underline} \[[their]{.underline}\] [desire to create a just
world]{.underline} for humans and non-humans'. [Decolonial jouissance of
the pluriverse induces the **absence of critical self-reflexivity** on
the part of the decolonial analyst]{.underline}, with the latter
portraying himself as transparent relay able to accurately capture the
subaltern voice. [The search for a subaltern pluriverse]{.underline}
thus [becomes a **self-fulfilling prophecy**: you project a pluriversal
platform on the subaltern and]{.underline} then [rejoice in miraculously
finding it! But in this mêlée, **the subaltern is not
heard**]{.underline} (which is why my above critique of Zapatista
participatory politics says less about the Zapatistas than Mignolo's
construction of them).

Mignolo's Manichaean [argumentation]{.underline} also [tends to be
**broadly dismissive of Western thought**, accusing it of complicity in
the colonial matrix of power]{.underline}, thus appealing for it to be
superseded (Mignolo, 2002: 80, 2010: 346). [He seems to **conflate
hegemonic European**]{.underline} (colonial) **[thought with European
thought writ large]{.underline}**. In so doing, he [fails to
acknowledge]{.underline} the many [European intellectual
counter-discourses to colonial rationality or binary
thinking]{.underline} (anti-imperialism, non-dualism, communitarianism,
etc.) [with which]{.underline}, for all intents and purposes, [much of
decolonial thought is allied]{.underline}. He fails as well to account
for his own debt to so-called Eurocentrism, disavowing that his
intellectual background, as well as the very language (English) and
critical tools he deploys (e.g. geopolitics, difference, epistemology,
gnoseology, aesthesis), are unavoidably Eurocentric (Kapoor and Zalloua,
2022: 99--100). Worse still, his [policing of the boundaries of what
is]{.underline} '[Western'/'non- Western]{.underline}' [ends up eliding
the centuries-old cultural and economic exchange between Europe and its
putative others]{.underline} (Africa, the Arab world, Indigenous
America, the Indian subcontinent, etc.); [or]{.underline} indeed
[the]{.underline} substantial [history of subaltern
resistance]{.underline} -- [in Europe's colonies, and in Europe
itself]{.underline} -- that is integral to the emergence of such notions
as 'equality', 'freedom', and 'social justice' (see, for example,
Anghie, 2005; Buck-Morss, 2009; Cusicanqui, 2012).

Thus, Mignolo's decolonial disavowal of the unconscious/Real is not only
deeply ideological for romanticizing subaltern pluriversality, but also
deeply depoliticizing. Rather than seeing internal (community or social
movement) differences and contradictions as weaknesses/traumas to be
suppressed or avoided in order to produce a perfect subaltern 'hero',
why not try to face them head-on to invent new and creative (although
never harmonious) subaltern political spaces? [Rather than understanding
colonial violence and dispossession as a reason to nostalgically
manufacture past or present glory or **wallow in victimhood and
resentment**]{.underline} (against European thinkers), **[why not
struggle to become proficient with, and use, European discourses of
emancipation and freedom to fight for]{.underline}** subaltern
**[equality and social justice everywhere]{.underline}**? [The Western
colonial legacy is indeed imperialist domination and plunder, but it is
also]{.underline}, as Žižek (2009) underlines, '[that of the
self-critical examination of the violence and exploitation the West
itself brought]{.underline} to the Third World . . . [the West supplied
the very standards by which it]{.underline} ([and its
critics]{.underline}) [measures its own criminal past]{.underline}' (p.
115). **[The antagonisms of European hegemony]{.underline}**, in this
sense, **[can be viewed as powerful subaltern political
resources]{.underline}**. And such is the case not only for the
subaltern from the Global South, but also for the subaltern from the
Global North: their common predicaments could be the occasion to find
cause together in shared trauma (Kapoor, 2020: xv, 66; Kapoor and
Zalloua, 2022: 20). This is something that Mignolo's demonization of the
West precludes, failing as it does to distinguish hegemonic from
subaltern (counter-) discourses, whether in the West or otherwise,
thereby further depoliticizing the subaltern.

Finally, there is the issue of the exclusion of the state and political
economy in Mignolo's gloss. [In regard to the state]{.underline},
Mignolo stands firmly against it, predictably [seeing it as the
political expression of]{.underline} ([Western]{.underline})
[coloniality]{.underline}. For him, pluriversal spaces would 'exist
independently of the state and corporations' by delinking 'from state
forms of governance, from the economy of accumulation' (Mignolo, 2018:
xii, xiv). Thus, 'the future would be composed of "communal nodes"
around the planet cooperating rather than competing with each other . .
. \[through\] the entanglement of several cosmologies connected today in
power differential' (Mignolo, 2011: 283, 2018: x).

But Mignolo's position [appears **politically naive**. Without
some]{.underline} form of [coordinating authority like a state, it
remains unclear how]{.underline} the [security and
well-being]{.underline} of 'communal nodes' [would be realized; what
would ensure **coop**eration, rather than conflict]{.underline}, among
and between nodes, especially [given]{.underline} '[power
differential]{.underline}'; and how these nodes would be able to thwart
the continuing incursion of global capital, or threats from both the
Western and 'de-Westernized' powers envisaged by Mignolo. It seems, in
fact, that his [pluriversal politics **unconsciously requires
a**]{.underline} national, regional, and/or transnational **[state to
ensure the coexistence of]{.underline}** '**[many
worlds']{.underline}**. He appears to count on such things as peace
enforcement, cooperation, provision of universal education and health
care, regulation of multi- nationals, campaigns against global viral
infections, and so forth, for his communal nodes to thrive.

As to political economy, it is all but absent in Mignolo's political
viewpoint, given his pluriversal privileging of epistemological, at the
expense of material, decolonization. He does sketchily mention imperial
resource extraction in his critique of coloniality, but says almost
nothing about the material dimensions of pluriversality. This is because
(expectedly) he assesses Marxist political economy as integral to a
'Eurocentered critique' (Mignolo, 2011: xi, xviii), glossing over the
many variants of Third World Marxisms (whether Nepalese, Cuban, Chinese,
South African, Peruvian, Indian, etc., many of which have been
actualized as political projects with varying degrees of
success/failure, including democratic communism in Kerala and Bengal,
for example). Mignolo (2010) looks instead to 'delinking from
capitalism' epistemologically (p. 339), as though decolonized knowledge
production will undo not just neoliberal ideology but the structures of
global capitalism. The overwhelming evidence to date points to just the
opposite: as mentioned earlier, the [success of corporate capitalism
lies]{.underline} in part [in its cooptation of the
epistemological-cultural claims of social movements]{.underline} --
[because not only do they not pose a threat to accumulation, but they
can]{.underline} also [be commodified to advance
accumulation]{.underline}. This is all the more the case with [a
decolonial politics of authenticity]{.underline} which, like
intersectionality, [**fixes and essentializes subaltern
culture/identity**, thereby **enabling its
commoditization**]{.underline}.

Consequently, [given the disavowal of any state-like authority or
meaningful materialist analysis or strategy]{.underline}, Mignolo's
[decolonial pluriversality yields to little more than]{.underline} what
decolonial Indigenous scholar Cusicanqui (2012) sees as
'[multiculturalism]{.underline}' (p. 104). Decoloniality may well mount
a critique of the coloniality of power, but in Mignolo's hands, just as
in Crenshaw's, [such critique]{.underline} nonetheless [ends up
**facilitating, not challenging, global capitalism**.
Localism/particularism nicely suits capitalism as much as
coloniality]{.underline}, since [it can be **readily accommodated if not
commodified**]{.underline}. So as with Crenshaw, my claim is that
Mignolo's disavowal of state/political economy and his accompanying
advocacy of the local amounts to an unconscious acceptance of capitalist
multiculturalism. We are thus left with another case of 'fetishistic
disavowal' -- a secret love for the System in spite of an outwardly
biting critique of it[. The global capitalist order sets]{.underline}
([and is allowed to set]{.underline}) [the boundary for decolonial
counterhegemonic critique]{.underline}.

[For postcolonial critique, the **contemporary abuse** of the
anti-colonial in far-right and ultranationalist projects reminds
us]{.underline} once [again of the dangers of **fetishizing nativist
ideologies** and **thinking of geopolitical macro-categories** such as
North/South and West/non-West **as opposing political
spheres**]{.underline}. Said's warning from 40 years ago remains
relevant today as ever: one cannot respond to "[the tyrannical
conjuncture of colonial power with scholarly Orientalism]{.underline}
simply [by proposing an alliance between nativist sentiment buttressed
some variety of native ideology to combat them]{.underline}" (Said,
1985:103). As Rao has reminded us more recently (2020: 9),
[if]{.underline} "[postcolonial critique is to continue to remain
meaningful]{.underline} in the contemporary world... [\[i\]t must be
attentive to shifts in power, including **those that enable formerly
colonised states to become colonial**]{.underline} in their own rights".
[For the study of the global right, considering the historical
entanglement of nationalism with neoliberalism and authoritarianism in
postcolonial contexts may question the newness of the]{.underline}
so-called "[populist]{.underline}" [backlash against
globalization]{.underline} in the Western core. Many have pointed out
that the far right or [the]{.underline} "[fascist
temptation]{.underline}" [is **not external to liberalism**]{.underline}
(Cooper, 2021, Mondon and Winter, 2020) and [right-wing nationalism and
neoliberalism are not antinomies]{.underline} (Hendrikse, 2018; Kiely,
2021). When we turn to the global trajectories of neoliberalism in the
"rest of the world", it becomes clear that they have long been
overlapped with histories of postcolonial authoritarianism and
nationalism (Watson, 2021). Moreover, [the employment of victimhood
narratives and the appropriation of the anti-colonial rhetoric
are]{.underline} also [characteristic of **right-wing discourses** in
former colonial powers]{.underline} (Al-Ghazzi 2021). Another venue for
future research would be to explore commonalities, differences, and
interconnections in these developments across contexts that are marked
by varying relationships with colonialism and are differently positioned
within global power structures.

I have argued that in the cases under examination in this article
[decolonial claims for liberation from colonial domination
**cannot**]{.underline} possibly **[erase nor overcome]{.underline}**
what is in fact a variety of [subjective positions that amalgamate
Western and non-Western identity markers in an unstable
relation]{.underline}. I have critically engaged with the work of some
influential Latin American decolonial thinkers as well as IR scholars
who have argued in favour of [retrieving non-Western
subjectivities]{.underline}. The focus was on some core concepts, such
as Mignolo's notions of border thinking and exteriority and Shilliam's
approach to anticolonial affective relationality. I claimed that these
authors have [often reduced]{.underline} their [decolonial theorising to
**binary reifications** of thoroughly negative Western and
**romanticised positive non-Western cultural retentions**]{.underline}.

Ultimately, I claim that the [decolonial approaches]{.underline} I have
examined in this article -- not- withstanding their crucial contribution
to the current theorising from the periphery of global politics -- [are
not adequate for understanding **hybrid post-Western configurations of
subjectivity**]{.underline}. In this regard, I have empirically
[examined the hybrid and paradoxical status of Latin American creole
elites, which combine Indigenous Amerindian with Spanish and European
cultural/cosmological sources into a project of breaking with the
Enlightenment tradition through reconstituting a self-sufficient
post-Western subjectivity]{.underline}. The examination of scholarly
work on Toussaint L'Ouverture's and Simón Bolívar's psychic drives and
political motivations [led to the **confirm**ation of the **inseparable
nature** of their Western and non-Western identity markers. Their
postcolonial subjectivity is]{.underline}, in this regard, [the result
of maintaining an **unstable balance** between imagined representations
of who they were as post-Western entities while striving
for]{.underline} political [liberation still **firmly attached** to an

Catton and Dunlap (1978), among others, have challenged the social
sciences to engage in the urgent task of dismantling the \'human
exceptionalism paradigm\'. Since then, myriad bodies of
transdisciplinary sciences and activism have constructed important
alternatives to the Enlightenment ontology of nature as primordial,
autonomous, and mechanistic, open to human extractivism (cf. Goldman and
Schurman, 2000). In [the non-human turn]{.underline}, this [is often
translated into the need to \'de-centre the human\']{.underline}. We
strongly identify with movements fighting against states' and elites'
exceptionalist claims to having the right to destroy the planet and
accumulate \'natural resources\'. At the same time, however, we warn
activists and academics of the need for caution regarding how
popularised non-human and RoN/RoR policy debates ontologically and
generically tend to de-centre the human. One main reason is that
[human]{.underline} (elite) [groups certainly are exceptional in how
they have radically transformed the human/non-human milieux]{.underline}
(Grusin, 2015; Büscher, 2021). [This demands that we address the **roots
and impacts of this exceptionality, instead of \'ontologising it
away\'**]{.underline}. It also asks for political contestation and the
devising of strategies to make particular classes responsible.
[De-centring the human in policy and activist currents may]{.underline}
tend to [**create binaries** between \'generalised humans\' and
\'generalised non-humans\'. These]{.underline} binaries may [blind us
not just to the exceptionally destructive capacities of some humans and
their inventions, but also to the exceptional suffering of
others]{.underline}. At the same time, it might blind us from
recognising the exceptionally creative capacities that humans have for
reversing the transformation, not just of their own environments, but of
the planetary system as a whole.

[In]{.underline} mainstream [water policies]{.underline}, for instance,
[de-centring humans' exceptional agency has led to **overlooking** the
**complex lived realities of riverine families, livelihoods, meanings,
values, identities, and rights systems**. These policies]{.underline}
have [constructed their own river dwellers and water users, with
identities that conveniently fit the models and policies]{.underline}
(Roa-García, 2014; Hoogesteger, 2015; Hidalgo-Bastidas et al., 2018). In
this way, [they justify **dramatic interventions**]{.underline} (e.g.
Nixon, 2009; Sanchis-Ibor et al., 2017; Lynch, 2019; Aubriot, 2022;
Duarte-Abadía, 2023; Heikkinen, 2024). The [mainstream nature-science-
policy nexus **takes exceptional agency away from \'targeted human
beneficiaries\' and simplifies their ontological diversity in line with
expert notions**. It]{.underline} thereby [produces policy models that
**depoliticise their deeply political choices while dehumanising the
people they affect**]{.underline}. In fact, [they perceive and construct
abstract \'equals\' rather than recognising highly differentiated and
plural realities]{.underline}.

Brackel et al. (2023) provide a common illustration. Communities
affected by the Manila Bay Sustainable Development Master Plan
(elaborated by Dutch and Pilipino \'experts\') were reduced to \"people
in PowerPoint pixels\". These people, who would soon be displaced,
disappeared from view through the \'upscaling perspective\' of
hydro-territorial transformation programs (cf. Melsen et al., 2018).
[Actively de-centring the human, and]{.underline} thereby [constructing
ignorance, helps to \'rationally\' intervene in the complex water world.
This **de-humanises water reality**. Rather than revealing]{.underline}
the [on-the-ground realities, **only governable subjects and objects
appear: an empty space for constructing and ordering rivers, water
users, and identities**]{.underline}.

[This picture is the contrary of what the posthuman]{.underline} and
non-human [turns intend to accomplish]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [in
de-centring the human]{.underline}, many dam removal
[campaigns]{.underline} in North America and Europe tend to
[misrecognise]{.underline} the peasant [communities]{.underline} who
build their livelihoods on the small and medium- sized dam systems --
dams whose removal they project will \'enliven rivers\' and re-centre
nature (for critical reflections, see Sneddon et al., 2017; Drapier et
al., 2023; Harrington and Cantor, 2024). Hommes (2022: 604) shows how
communities along Spain's Mijares river fiercely contest dam removal
that would dry out a local irrigation canal: \"Destroying the Toranes
Dam is damaging this natural, territorial, and social ecosystem in which
we live, it is destroying an organised community \[in reference to the
irrigation community\]\". Another illustration is how RoN policy
advocates may unwittingly collaborate in new enclosures of riverine
commons (Duarte-Abadía et al., 2023). For instance, in the Andean
wetlands of Tungurahua, Ecuador, campesino-indigenous communities deploy
territory-situated conservation practices, but international
conservation agencies threaten them with RoN-based court cases that
could take away their ancestral governance rights if they fail to comply
with PES-based conservation schemes (pers. com. Juan Hidalgo-Bastidas,
10/04/2024). In parallel, RoN and RoR policies de-centring the human may
invisibilise powerful interests. Kinkaid (2019: 561), for instance,
shows how RoN imposition on the Hindu-religious rivers Ganges and Yamuna
by India's right-wing Hindu-nationalist government may lead to the
violent expulsion of Muslim and Dalit river dwellers (labelled
\'unclean\' tannery polluters of the sacred rivers) while leaving the
overall environmental status quo unchallenged.

In general, Büscher posits that, [for the purpose of understanding how
capitalism has made humans alienate themselves from
non-humans]{.underline}, \"\[...\] [it **makes little sense to decentre
the human**]{.underline}\" (2021: 7). [Because we live in increasingly
alienated interrelationships, we have to **re-emphasise
our**]{.underline} (**[human]{.underline}**) [**bonds with and
dependence on the rest of life**. This pays **genuine attention to the
agency, life worlds, and exceptional potential of highly divergent water
commons and collectives**]{.underline}. This [re-centring
would]{.underline} also [challenge any de-contextualised and detached
prescription of the diverse identities and nature of human and non-human
collectives]{.underline}.

### Alt Fails\-\--Blue Humanities\-\--2AC

#### Blue humanities [fail]{.underline}\-\--water cannot represent a [singular ontology]{.underline}, and thinking with the blue [reproduces their impacts]{.underline}. 

Michel **Büch 24**, Postdoctoral Researcher and Producer of the
University Players at the University of Hamburg Institute of English and
American Studies, Ph.D. from the University of Bremen, "'I want a
bath!': On the Depth and Limits of Universalist Liquefaction in Sarah
Ruhl\'s Eurydice," Comparative Drama, Vol. 58, No. 4, Winter 2024,
accessed 06-28-2025, ProQuest, DG

In this essay, I have pitched the engagement with the water metaphor and
materiality in a somewhat phenomenological way against these familiar
and familial readings. I have considered the figure of Eurydice, as well
as the play as a whole, through a kind of blue humanities lens because I
felt there was a lacuna in the way it was discussed, and I could
contribute to the discourse. I have thus attempted to meet it on its own
grounds and have found the discourse on water insightful. The water
metaphor appeared to offer a way into an aesthetic experience beyond
mere recognition for the scholar. However, having sought to address the
play on its own terms, I have been limited by [the]{.underline} very
[limitations]{.underline} that limit the play-and ironically, they
[appear]{.underline} the most [limitless]{.underline}, i.e. the notions
of [fluidity, instability of meaning]{.underline}, and so on. The
effects are consequential; here are some examples.

First, we must recognize that [the metaphor and image of water may
signify differently]{.underline} than Bachelard\'s vision. [The Middle
Passage]{.underline}, for example, [has given rise to an ontology of
being in/as water, where water is **not merely a metaphor** but
signifies **contingent, very concrete death**]{.underline}. The water in
the Atlantic Ocean holds the bodies and specters of those who were
thrown overboard, because insurance payments were higher than their
market value.57 M. NourbeSe Philips Zong! begins with water- but not as
a transcendental, posthumanist vision. Here, [the collapse of meaning
in/as water is a site of horror: **not a liberation** from binary bounds
but a **violent erasure of identity**]{.underline}. In Zong!, [water is
not a space of cleansing or purification but one of trauma, disruption,
and obliteration. Its vastness and depth do not evoke a transcendental
sphere of connection but instead embody an **unfathomable abyss**. The
absence of language to confront the dehumanizing violence and wounds of
enslavement is **not a void to be desired but an unspeakability that
demands reckoning**]{.underline}. Christina [Sharpe uses]{.underline}
the meaning and metaphor of [the]{.underline} \"[wake]{.underline}\" [to
evoke]{.underline}, among other associations, [the literal meanings of
mourning and remembrance and the metaphorical ones associated with the
wake left behind by a]{.underline} ([slave]{.underline}) [ship in
water]{.underline}: the ripple effects of history, where the wake of
past events continues to shape the present. [There is]{.underline}
\"[loss]{.underline}\" [here]{.underline} too, [but of an **entirely
different scale and register**]{.underline} than the themes of Eurydice.
A different example: for African and European audiences, the play\'s
notion of a \"salty lake\" might evoke the Mediterranean Sea and, by
extension, the violent Frontex regime \"securing\" Europe\'s
borders-ironically on the shores of Greece. Swimming courses that help
migrants develop a new relationship to water, after enduring traumatic
experiences, are one symptom of this.58 There is, therefore, [a **clear
distinction** between the imaginary qualities of water signifying death
in a metaphysical sense]{.underline} (which might be accessible only to
minds shaped by white ignorance), [and the]{.underline} very
[**non-metaphorical meanings** of water linked to historically concrete
realities, such as the ontologies of Blackness as social death or the
resonance of violent border regimes]{.underline}.

Second, the [posthumanist fantasies that traverse the blue
humanities]{.underline}-inspired focus on water, all those \"appeals to
move \'beyond the human\' [may]{.underline} actually **[reintroduce the
Eurocentric transcendentalism this movement purports to
disrupt]{.underline}**, particularly [with regard to the historical and
ongoing distributive ordering of race]{.underline}\"59 [To
performatively shed human individualism requires a subjective
capacity]{.underline} that has **[only]{.underline}** **[been available
to whites]{.underline}**. In a racialized modernity, in Wilderson\'s
words, [one needs to belong to the]{.underline} \"[race of
Humanism]{.underline}\"60 in order [to ponder]{.underline} the beyond or
[posthumanism]{.underline} in the first place. [The]{.underline}
somewhat [moralizing attempts to envision humans beyond
race]{.underline} even [provoke **absurd notions**, because for those
inhabiting discursive Blackness, the]{.underline} allegedly [salvaging
prefix is followed by a negation]{.underline}. Posthumanist thought is,
then, not doing the work it claims or desires to do. It is
non-performative, to use Sara Ahmed\'s term. [Its]{.underline}
\"[gestures toward the \'post\' or the \'beyond\' effectively **ignore
praxes of humanity and critiques produced by black people, leading to
awkward bends, incommensurable logics, and difficult
postures**]{.underline}. (Thus, Barack Obamas election did not signal a
postracial era-though the idea appealed to many-and the awkward postures
to pretend it did are now being broadly and violently relaxed.) Here,
[the]{.underline} \"[post]{.underline}\" [instantiates the prior,
reasserting the very structures it (cl)aims to surpass]{.underline}.

The present critique raises several points about the dynamics of
universalism and its often-unexamined Eurocentric underpinnings in the
theater, while at the same time being fully implicated in them. Eurydice
may not be a particularly egregious example of these tendencies, but its
popularity and the discourse it generates reveal how often [white,
Eurocentric perspectives shape the creation, interpretation, and
reception of art]{.underline}-[especially works that aspire
to]{.underline} \"[timelessness]{.underline}\" [or address]{.underline}
\"[universal]{.underline}\" [themes]{.underline}. Theater scholars,
producers, audiences, designers, directors, and actors are left with a
dual responsibility: to reckon with the artistry of works like Eurydice
while critically interrogating their discursive and political
implications. This involves perceiving how such works might perpetuate
racially normative ideas about universality and \"the human\" What
Eurydice does with water and agency invites us to take up this
responsibility, even as it may slips through our fingers.

### Alt Fails\-\--Scholarship\-\--2AC

#### Affirming scholarship is a [hollow gesture]{.underline} that stifles the possibility for material change.

Dorothy **Figueria 8**, Professor of Comparative Literature at the

There was indeed a clear paradox inherent in structuralist theory.
[While intellectuals were]{.underline} ostensively [working for change
and developing theoretical weapons]{.underline} to advance a progressive
struggle, [they were]{.underline} at the same time being [seduced by a
paradigm that **stifled all desire for change** and **announced the end
of history**]{.underline} (Dosse 1991:2.72). With a vengeance, May 1968
would exhume history and the subject that structuralism had repressed.
The Annales historians, in particular, were beneficiaries of 1968, since
they were able to transform "History" into "histories" (Veyne 1971).
[History was still discovering the Other]{.underline}. However, [this
Other was not in other lands, but could]{.underline} now [be studied
**within Western civilization** in the form of cultural
histories]{.underline} and the study of mentalités. 4 Anthropology's
Other had become its own past and values. Sometimes [the Other
became]{.underline} just **[the theorist's present]{.underline}**.
Simone de Beauvoir's mandarins of existentialism became Kristeva's
samurai in the new cult of personality. 5 [Criticism turned its
attention to the **discovery of the Self** and its
pleasures]{.underline}, in the case of Barthes, 6 [or]{.underline} in
the case of Kristeva, [its abjection]{.underline}. While it may seem to
be truly the grand return of the repressed subject, it would be a
mistake to think that the Self had not always been present for
theorists.

[It became **increasingly fashionable** to situate onself **at the
edges** of a system of thought]{.underline} in order [to **manipulate**
and **move those edges**. We were no longer interested in the hell of
others, but **the hell in the Self**]{.underline}. In the Archaeology of
Knowledge, Michel [Foucault]{.underline} claimed that man was an
invention of recent date soon to disappear (Foucault 1972:387). He
[championed the destruction of history, faceless writing, and pure
freedom]{.underline} (Foucault 1972:17). The idea was **[to decenter
man]{.underline}** as author, subject, and speaker. Georges Canguilhem's
work on psychology (asking whether it served science or the police) set
the stage for Foucault's work on asylums, prisons, and madness.
[Self-awareness regarding the limits of knowing others]{.underline} now
[became a **precondition for engagement**]{.underline}. Foucault focused
on the periphery and the margins of a system. He analyzed the
development of European civilization as a process of marginalizing
domestic misfits who were kept under surveillance through the
cooperation of social "power" and "knowledge." He further examined
deviation and marginality in Discipline and Punish (1975). The History
of Sexuality (1976) offered a discourse on sex as a form of managerial
power found in censuses and the psychiatrization of deviation.
[The]{.underline} structuralist [ideal]{.underline} had shift[ed from a
scientific method informed by political and cultural pessimism into a
**liberation antitheology celebrating difference**]{.underline},
wherever it might be found.
