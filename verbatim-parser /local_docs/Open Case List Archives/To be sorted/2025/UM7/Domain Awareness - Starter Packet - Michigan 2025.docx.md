# Aff---Domain Awareness

### Note

This aff argues that the US needs to increase its detection capability
in order to support **domain awareness (**operational knowledge of a
particular sphere of concern) in the arctic. It does so by increasing
sensors, radars, satellites and uncrewed aerial and underwater vehicles
that help monitor different parts of the arctic.

The current version of this aff is largely focused on the military
implications of having these technologies. Future research could
definitely explore more environmental themes.

If the 1ac is too long, you can definitely de-highlight some of the
cards. It is highlighted to be a bit too long on purpose, because the
goal is to get you to be intentional about highlighting. You can also
take out some cards on advantage 1.

## 1ac

### Plan

#### The United States federal government should increase its deployment of domain awareness technology, including early warning radars, uncrewed aerial and underwater vehicles, and satellites, in the Arctic. 

### A1 - Miscalculation

#### Advantage 1 is miscalculation

#### The Arctic is on a collision course for nuclear escalation between the US, China, and Russia

1\) Arctic-specific capabilities

**[[Continued investments in Arctic]{.mark}-specific
[hardware]{.mark}]{.underline}** and equipment [**[are]{.underline}**
**[paramount]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[successfully [deterring Russia]{.mark}'s contestation efforts [and
Chinese]{.mark} regional [encroachments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More
than ever, Arctic capabilities must respond to specific missions.

NATO and allies must define what capabilities they will require to
operate in the region. As noted above, across the NATO 7 nations
critical capabilities gaps abound, in cold weather hardware,
ice-strengthened assets, ice-capable ships with anti-aircraft and
anti-submarine capabilities,129 infrastructure suited for effective
early warning threat detection systems and air defense,130 radar
coverage and aerial domain awareness, subsea sensing, and Arctic-related
logistics and resupplies, among others.

**[[An essential part]{.mark} of the US DoD Arctic strategy's
"monitor-and-respond" approach [is]{.mark} to]{.underline}** **[enhance
US Arctic capabilities in]{.underline}** critical areas such as
**[[domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and dedicated cold weather
equipment.50 Yet the US and the Arctic 7 as a whole have a low starting
point in terms of cold weather and ice-strengthened capabilities.

Regarding conventional capabilities, the current environment has shown
the need to increase physical access and presence in the region thanks
to icebreakers. Recognizing that it will not close the "icebreaker gap"
on its own, the US recently unveiled a trilateral partnership with
Canada and Finland called the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE
Pact.131 The ICE Pact will help build polar icebreakers and other
surface assets in the logic of burden sharing and comparative advantages
--- although it heavily leans on ensuring job security and retaining
skills in US shipyards.

**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**nother **[[paramount

Arctic Monitoring

**[U.S. North]{.underline}**ern **[Com]{.underline}**mand Commander Gen.
Glen VanHerck repeatedly **[called for increased awareness across
multiple domains]{.underline}**, including better sensors and data
sharing. The U.S. military defines five domains: space, air, land,
maritime, and cyberspace. Some of the domains are broken into
sub-domains (e.g., the maritime domain can be broken into surface,
subsurface, and seabed). **[[Effective monitoring boils down to
maintaining coverage]{.mark} of these domains [with appropriate
sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[synthesizing the collected data, then
interpreting it to understand the situation and make
decision]{.underline}**s. Realizing the monitoring goal in the Arctic
requires effort across these areas, but [**[the primary shortfall is
sensors]{.underline}**, **[especially air and maritime
sensors.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

I will not dive deeper into space monitoring, since this is a
well-researched area. Pituffik Space Base's primary purpose today is as
a crucial node of space detection capabilities, particularly for missile
defense and polar orbits. The necessary investments are already being
made, or at least debated, within the Department of Defense. Air and sea
sensors, though, are a different story.

Air Domain Awareness

**[Most discussions on Arctic air domain awareness focus on space-based
sensors]{.underline}**, **[over-the-horizon radars, and occasional
deployments of airborne assets such as large surveillance aircraft like
the E-3 or unmanned aircraft.]{.underline}** Shorter range radar
systems, such as those in the Cold War-era North Warning System, receive
little attention since long-range and maneuverable missiles have
diminished their effectiveness.

The U.S. Space Force plans to field a space-based sensing constellation
for air and surface tracking. **[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should increase]{.mark}]{.underline}** this **[[investment to add
satellites]{.mark} with this functionality]{.underline}** and seek
Danish support. **[[A robust polar]{.mark} low Earth orbit
[constellation would ensure full Arctic coverage]{.mark} while enhancing
surveillance in other theaters.]{.underline}** Additionally, the Danish
Joint Arctic Command in Nuuk should have access to this space-based
intelligence.

**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[should complement space-based sensors with air-based
platforms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[building resilience that improves
tracking precision and bolsters communications capabilities, thereby
enabling very long-range weapons]{.underline}**. Large air surveillance
aircraft like the E-3 are overburdened today and demand for its
replacement, the E-7, will increase in wartime.
**[[High-altitude]{.mark}, long-endurance [autonomous
aircraft]{.mark}]{.underline}** flying from Greenland **[[could]{.mark}
significantly [improve Arctic surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[support American industrial base growth]{.underline}**, **[and
provide re-deployable assets for global sensing grids]{.underline}**.

Existing systems like the RQ-4 are viable, but cost-effective
off-the-shelf options can be rapidly acquired. **[Many companies offer
stratospheric long-endurance autonomous aircraft]{.underline}** carrying
payloads up to 1,000 kilograms. [**[Arctic weather presents
challenges]{.underline}**, **[but flying in the stratosphere mitigates
most environmental impacts]{.underline}**]{.mark}, with only sensor
effectiveness and launch and recovery affected.

Basing these assets in Greenland facilitates patrolling both west across
the northern line and east across the Greenland-Svalbard-Norway gap. The
US footprint in Greenland would be minimal, potentially fewer than one
hundred personnel, similar to a drone launch and recovery unit. Many
positions could be contracted, reducing the need for uniformed
personnel.

Maritime Domain Awareness

Like in the air domain, a space sensing network can provide surface
detection, but **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[should expand its undersea
surveillance]{.mark} beyond regular submarine patrols]{.underline}**.
**[[A moderately sized autonomous maritime force]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in Greenland, similar to U.S. Central Command's Task Force 59, **[[could
provide persistent coverage of the Arctic east of the Lomonosov
Ridge]{.underline}]{.mark}** and throughout the Greenland and Norwegian
Seas. This **[force should leverage unmanned surface and undersea
vessels, with undersea systems playing a particularly vital
role.]{.underline}**

**[Much like high altitude, long-endurance aerial drones]{.underline}**,
**[many companies offer surface and undersea systems that the United
States could capitalize on quickly]{.underline}**. Other unconventional
opportunities exist, such as a self-sustaining autonomous system
proposed by engineers for Arctic operations featuring a wind- and
water-powered surface craft carrying both aerial and undersea drones.

#### Strong Arctic domain awareness is key to prevent miscalculation and accidental escalation:

#### 1. It provides key information for [crisis decisionmaking]{.underline} and makes [all methods of de-escalation]{.underline} more effective

Establishing Information Dominance

**[[Arctic domain awareness]{.mark} and information dominance [hinge on
the ability to get timely information to
decision-makers]{.mark}]{.underline}**---that is, both the broad
understanding of the operational environment left-of-launch and the
tactical information required to make an intercept right-of-launch.

**[To achieve that dominance, [the U.S. must invest to improve several
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Satellite communications are
the first requirement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[essential for]{.mark}
[early]{.mark} threat indications and [warning]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[because they provide a means to share intelligence with remotely
piloted UAVs]{.underline}** flying in the farthest regions of the
Arctic, control their operations, and pipe their feeds back to
decision-makers. Today, satellite communications coverage is sparse in
the Arctic, but both OneWeb and SpaceX's Starlink are expanding their
network of commercial proliferated LEO communication satellites to
improve coverage in the high north. The SDA's ongoing fielding of a
satellite communications transport layer in LEO will also provide
high-speed data connectivity for U.S. warfighters operating in remote
regions worldwide, including in the Arctic.

**[Connectivity between UAVs and any other aircraft to the space-based
transport layer requires the benefits of optical communications
technology]{.underline}**. **[Laser communications leverage the highly
resilient, satellite proliferated transport layer]{.underline}** now
being fielded by the SDA. The result is high-speed, flexible, and secure
communication links across the air defense network that enables not only
force projection abroad, but also homeland defense. Allies and partners
can contribute: Norway's Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission (ASBM) will
launch two satellites into highly elliptical orbit by 2024, and these
will provide improved broadband satellite communications within the
Arctic region.

**[While [environmental sensing]{.mark} deep into the Arctic [can be
facilitated by an all-weather UAV]{.mark}]{.underline}** like the MQ-9B,
**[[there is a need for a multi-faceted approach to sensing]{.mark}
weather that affects air, sea, and land operations in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** However, the Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program (DMSP) is well past its lifetime as a defense-dedicated weather
sensor that covers the Arctic in a polar orbit, and
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. **[[Space Force is developing
its]{.underline}]{.mark}** Electro-optical Infrared Weather Satellite
Program (**[[EWS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), which will ultimately need to
be disaggregated as a constellation of satellites that provide both
higher performance and resilience against attack by an adversary. While
the Space Force is handling the program well, **[[Congress needs to
ensure adequate resources are available to keep the program on
track.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence **[[could help get the right
information to the right decision-makers]{.mark} at the right
time.]{.underline}** NORAD and **[NORTHCOM have conducted global
information dominance]{.underline}** or (GIDE) **[experiments to fuse
sensor data from a variety of platforms]{.underline}** and dramatically
reduce the time required to get threat information to decision-makers.
Once one sensor picks up a potential threat, AI cross-cues that data
with other sensor information to confirm, identify, and attribute the
threat. VanHerck said this enables U.S. forces to go from being reactive
to proactive.

Battle management platforms, including AEW&C aircraft, can add to
tactical information dominance once a threat is incoming.

**[[This overlapping]{.mark}, layered [approach to missile
defeat]{.mark} in the Arctic [can give U.S. leaders more time to
proactively shape adversary behavior and manage
escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Early threat detection buys time
to]{.mark} more effectively [apply non-kinetic
options]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[including diplomatic, economic, or

**[At the heart of the breakdown in relations is Russia's annexation of
Crimea]{.underline}** and subsequent invasion of Ukraine, actions that
alienated fellow Arctic nations. Further tensions have been caused by
Russia's increased activity in the Arctic due to warming waters that
make passage possible as Russia expands investment there, asserts its
boundaries and facilitates China's entry into the region.

The strategic importance of the High North

The High North is defined as the region north of the Arctic Circle, or
above 66.5 degrees latitude. The region encompasses 6 percent of the
earth's surface in an area of 8.2 million square miles, two-thirds of
which comprises the Arctic Ocean.

The area is rich in resources and is estimated to hold one-third of the
world's natural gas, 13 percent of global oil reserves and vast
quantities of minerals and rare-earth metals. The Arctic also offers
three valuable trade routes for navigating the polar region, including
the Northwest Passage, the Transpolar Sea Route and the Northern Sea
Route, the latter of which is normally open for only a brief period each
year.

Finally, the region is of continuing military strategic importance due
to its proximity to the U.S. and Russia and as a crucial link between
the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of operation. Its location is also
essential for communications infrastructure including satellites.

Access rights to resources are held by eight Arctic nations including
Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia and the U.S.
However, due to the region's economic and strategic advantages, both
Arctic and non-Arctic nations seek a presence in the region.

The end of cooperation

Until recently, the High North enjoyed geopolitical stability and
cooperation among the Arctic nations, including the establishment in
1996 of the Arctic Council. An independent intergovernmental body, the
council began its mission by serving as the leading intergovernmental
forum promoting cooperation and coordination among the Arctic nations,
Arctic Indigenous peoples and other inhabitants with a focus on
sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic.

As the council evolved, its members supported creation of an adjunct
Arctic Chiefs of Defense Conference consisting of periodic meetings
during which the highest-ranking military leaders of the Arctic nations
would resolve issues, foster collaboration and provide transparency for
regional military operations. This stability earned the region the label
of "High North, Low Tension."

Unfortunately, these cooperation efforts were deeply damaged when
Vladimir Putin illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and then attacked the
sovereign territory of Ukraine in 2022. As a result of these acts of
aggression, the council members ostracized the Russian Federation and
froze communications. Putin acutely felt this due to reliance on foreign
investment and technology to fuel his plans to achieve polar great power
status.

But **[[Russia has proven]{.underline}]{.mark}** surprisingly
**[[resilient]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and its economy has rebounded.
**[[Its military has]{.mark} also [been boosted by a resilient
industrial base]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There is currently no dialog
with Russian political or military leaders in [the]{.mark} chambers of
the [Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[this has resulted in
a situation [akin to having a "hot line" where neither side picks up the
phone when it rings.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Warming waters increase access and interest

The changing climate is also changing the dynamic. While accessing the
Arctic's resources and trade routes previously had been difficult due to
the challenging environment, the region is now warming at least twice
and perhaps as much as four times the global rate, contributing to a
reduction in Arctic ice, which is now at historical lows. An examination
of satellite imagery shows that the Arctic region is now more blue water
than white ice.

With more open water and unhindered passage through the Arctic region
for longer periods, the great powers are taking on a new level of
interest. For example, Russia, with more than 50 percent of the Arctic
coastline -- and more than half of the Arctic population -- has invested
heavily in the economic, societal and military development of its Arctic
zone.

It has also sought to monetize the Northern Sea Route, declaring that
passage through the Northern Sea Route requires sovereign state
permission, 45 days' notice, pre-paid tariffs for safe passage and the
requirement to use Russian pilots and Russian icebreakers as escorts,
which is rejected by Western nations that demand the right to transit
passage of an international strait in accordance with the U.N.
Convention on Law of the Sea.

Furthermore, since 2001 Russia has challenged the status quo and
traditional boundaries on the continental shelf bordering the Russian
Federation in the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
(CLCS).

In fact, in August 2007, the Russians planted a one-meter titanium flag
at the base of the Lomonosov Ridge, near the North Pole, which the
Russians claim is connected to the Siberian continental shelf of the
Russian Federation.

Canada and Denmark challenge these claims with both submitting their own
claims due to their own sovereign interest in oil and gas exploration in
this area. The Russians have a good chance of a favorable ruling,
potentially giving the Russian Federation control over 460,000 square
miles or 70 percent of the Arctic continental shelf, inclusive of the
oil, gas and mineral harvesting rights therein.

An increasingly militarized region

The Arctic was once known as a region of peaceful cooperation but is now
becoming better known for its militarization. Many Arctic and non-Arctic
nations now operate their warships and submarines in the Arctic Ocean,
and there is no regulatory body to provide deconfliction or risk
mitigation when different navies interact.

Seven of the eight Arctic Council nations are members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and this allows for coordination
and cooperation amongst those members' navies, but neither Russia nor
China has a seat at the table in NATO headquarters.

Accordingly, the Arctic region risks becoming a proving ground for
large-scale exercises and testing and experimentation of Western,
Russian and Chinese weapons of war. Russia has long used the North to
conduct weapons testing. It is currently conducting sea trials of its
mammoth new submarine, Belgorod, which is capable of deploying a
nuclear-powered deep diving mini-sub and the dual-use Poseidon torpedo
with long ranges that can traverse the Atlantic Ocean.

Likewise, **[[the Russians have perfected hypersonic
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**, already employed in the Ukraine
conflict, **[and the Arctic proving ground offers another area for
testing and evaluation]{.underline}**. **[Some Russian icebreakers are
even capable of being armed with the Kalibr cruise
missile]{.underline}**, which is similar to the U.S. Tomahawk cruise
missile.

Putin has also been expanding Russia's global interests by strengthening
partnerships with China and North Korea, while courting regimes across
Africa and Asia. It is only a matter of time before the Chinese exploit
their growing partnership with Russia in the High North by conducting
military operations in the Arctic region.

**[We should not be surprised in the next few years when a Chinese
nuclear submarine surfaces at the North Pole.]{.underline}**

**[[China's interest in the Arctic is part of their long-term strategy
of domination]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including the development of
strategic infrastructure. The Chinese have been in the market for an
Arctic operating base for more than a decade to complete President Xi's
"One Belt, One Road" strategy.

In order to facilitate operations on the "Polar Silk Road," the Chinese
know that they must ensure a robust intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance and communications architecture in space, thereby placing
them in direct competition for bandwidth and orbits over the polar
region.

As the ice melts, it will present opportunities for seeding new networks
of critical undersea infrastructure (CUI) in the form of pipelines or
communication cables, as well as the opportunity to interdict existing
or future networks of CUI from Western nations.

The West falls behind

The Western allies are woefully behind in the race to establish an
enduring presence in the Arctic region.

For the U.S. Navy, while submarines periodically operate in the High
North, we no longer build surface warships fit for Arctic operations.
The U.S. Coast Guard has one 48-year-old heavy icebreaker, Polar Star,
and we have fallen behind in the timeline for delivery of a replacement.
The planned U.S. Coast Guard Polar Security Cutter (PSC) is not
scheduled to deliver until 2028, nor deploy until 2030 or later.

As a gap filler, the Coast Guard is considering the leasing of one
commercial icebreaker while we wait for the arrival of the PSC. Though
the Coast Guard's medium icebreaker, Healy, has traditionally conducted
the research missions of the Arctic, it is insufficient to fulfill the
presence, research and law enforcement missions demanded by the evolving
strategic environment.

By contrast, the Russians have more than 50 icebreakers, some of which
are nuclear powered, giving them the ability to remain on station
indefinitely. Likewise, the Chinese are following suit and building
their own icebreaker fleet.

**[In order [to compete in the polar region]{.mark}, it [would be
premature to flood the area with warships]{.mark} or icebreakers without
a robust supporting infrastructure]{.underline}**. **[[Domain
awareness]{.mark} and communications capabilities [are at the forefront
of requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Frankly, **[we have ignored the
development of networks over the poles due to competing
priorities.]{.underline}**

**[There is currently limited capacity for Western geosynchronous
orbiting satellites over the poles]{.underline}** as well as limited
land based supporting infrastructure. SpaceX has launched more than
5,000 Starlink satellites in the last few years. Intended for commercial
use, Starlink has quickly adapted to military requirements, particularly
during the war in Ukraine. **[The network currently has 200 dedicated
satellites over in the polar region]{.underline}**, **[but it is
insufficient to rely on a sole source commercial solution]{.underline}**
to solve the current gap in bandwidth and military requirements.

Essential next steps

**[Clearly, [more must be done.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

U.S. Northern Command (**[NORTHCOM]{.underline}**) has identified the
critical need and is programming resources to fill the void. Meanwhile,
we should take advantage of commercial solutions and provide incentives
for others to follow suit.

The Saint Lawrence Island, which is part of Alaska, presents both a
strategic foothold in the Bering Sea and opportunities for
infrastructure investment. Since the Saint Lawrence Island is sovereign
U.S. territory, it would be prudent to base the first tranche of
land-based infrastructure in support of space operations there with
deference to environmental concerns.

**[The need for infrastructure in the Arctic is not just pertinent to
the ability of the U.S. to maintain a presence in the region and ensure
freedom of passage through the global commons]{.underline}**. **[The
tangible threat to the homeland represented by Russia, and increasingly
China, necessitates a close look at this issue in the context of our
ability to effectively defend the homeland.]{.underline}**

Specifically, **[[substantial gaps exist in Arctic domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and in the ability to command and
control homeland defense forces in the far reaches of the region. **[A
robust ability to communicate and to move data across the broad expanse
of the Arctic is essential]{.underline}** to both. The existing
communications backbone organic to the Department of Defense (DOD) is
wholly inadequate to the task, but there is strong potential to leverage
commercial assets currently in place and planned for the future. **[[DoD
must redouble its efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}** to engage with
commercial partners **[if they are to invest commensurately in the
capabilities required to meet defense needs.]{.underline}**

Since the dawn of the Cold War, **[[the high north]{.mark} has been seen
as an attractive attack vector for long range strike]{.underline}** for
one simple reason: **[it [provides shortest distance between the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and
Eurasia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Today**[, [the Arctic]{.mark} it
[is]{.mark} still seen by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China as [an
appealing attack vector]{.mark}]{.underline}** for their missiles and
long-range aviation assets **[[given]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[[the
Arctic's]{.underline}]{.mark}** geography and **[[insufficient
monitoring]{.mark} by the United States]{.underline}**. **[The growing
Arctic presence of China]{.underline}**---a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic
state" and custodian of an increasingly robust long-range aviation and
missile inventory---**[reinforces the region's significance as a staging
ground for conventional air and cruise missile attacks.]{.underline}**

**[Yet [the U.S. ability to detect]{.mark}, track, attribute, and
counter [attacks]{.mark} coming [from the north has]{.mark}
significantly [diminished]{.mark} since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}**, **[[even as]{.mark} America's potential
[adversaries]{.mark} have [prioritized development of missiles]{.mark}
of all types over the same three decades]{.underline}**. **[China and
Russia have explored options to employ long-range, conventional weapons
to deter U.S. leaders without provoking a nuclear
response]{.underline}**. **[[Chinese doctrine describes precision
strikes as a means of "war control" to manage
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and frame power-projection nodes.
**[[Missile warfare is becoming a premier means for Russia to project
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**; in Ukraine, Russia has launched hundreds
of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as suicide drones, targeting
power grids and other critical infrastructure in an attempt to force
Kyiv into a settlement.

As the 2022 Missile Defense Review noted, [**[missile threats to the
U.S. homeland have]{.underline}** "**[rapidly
expanded]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in quantity, diversity, and
sophistication]{.underline}**." Modern conventional cruise missiles pose
the greatest threat; they are harder to detect, track, target, and
intercept than ballistic missiles.

**[[Adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** have begun to **[[favor cruise
missile development]{.underline}]{.mark}** over ballistic missiles
**[because they greatly complicate detection and early
warning]{.underline}**. This is part of a broader missile development
trend that favors increasingly maneuverable designs. **[Hypersonic
cruise missiles]{.underline}**, for instance, **[fly at Mach 5 or
faster.]{.underline}** While hypersonic missiles produce a greater heat
signature and are less maneuverable, their extreme speed produces a
considerable advantage. China's fractional orbital bombardment system,
or (FOBS), takes this capability to a still more striking level, with a
highly maneuverable hypersonic glide missile that is launched into orbit
and then re-enters the earth's atmosphere on an unpredictable
trajectory.

**[To date, the U.S. has only mounted a tepid response to these
threats]{.underline}**. Throughout the post-Cold War period of the 1990s
and early 2000s, Arctic defense planning took a backseat to other
geopolitical concerns for both the United States and Russia. Following
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian economy imploded,
and its Northern Fleet and air assets fell into disrepair. Post-Cold War
arms reduction treaties, combined with a major shift in the U.S.
military's focus toward operations in the Middle East after Sept. 11,
2001, contributed to DOD reducing its Arctic focus. **[DOD closed or
downsized almost all of its bases in Alaska and significantly shrank
other capabilities for defending the northern approach to the United
States]{.underline}**. This is reflected by NORAD's continued reliance
on the aging North Warning System (NWS), a network of 47 long-range and
short-range radars first fielded in the 1980s and equipped with
1970s-era technology.

This system was only designed to identify approaching Soviet bombers
after launch and flying within radar range. Today, it cannot provide
early indications and warning of adversary force posture changes in the
Arctic, which could be a prelude to an attack. Nor can the NWS detect
air and missile threats launched from inside Russia or bombers, cruise
missiles, drones flying too low or too far to be detected by its radar.

**[As Russia and China develop stealthier cruise missiles and diversify
their cruise missile launch options]{.underline}** to include
land-based, surface, and subsurface platforms, **[[the gaps in the
N]{.mark}orth [W]{.mark}arning [S]{.mark}ystem's effective
[radar]{.mark} [coverage will continue to
increase.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"Imagine a solid fence shrinking to a picket fence," notes Gen. Glen D.
VanHerck, head of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S.
Northern Command. "And now you have cruise missiles that can get through
your capability to detect."

**[[The legacy U.S. air and missile defense
paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark}**, focused as it is on kinetic intercept,
remains important and [**[needs to be urgently
modernized]{.underline}**,]{.mark} but an overreliance on kinetic kill
platforms, delivery systems, and weapons alone limits warfighter
options.

**[A network of ground-based radars]{.underline}**---including those in
the North Warning System---**[and a small number of
fighters]{.underline}** on air defense alert at air bases around the
country **[provide today's air defense of the contiguous United
States]{.underline}**. These fighters are on alert status to rapidly
respond to and intercept foreign military aircraft, such as Russian
bomber patrols that routinely fly near and occasionally into U.S.
airspace. Air Force fighters also intercept unidentified aircraft,
aircraft that have strayed from planned flight paths, and aircraft that
are not properly communicating with air traffic control.

The small numbers of fighters and the lack of a system of sensors that
can detect low-flying targets over long ranges limit the system's
effectiveness against modern cruise missiles and other threats. Air
defense systems such as Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD), or the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System
(NASAMS), which is used to defend the Washington, D.C., National Capital
Region, offer some defense against low-volume missile threats, but these
low-density, high-demand assets are extremely costly; they cost more per
shot than the missiles they defend against, and are ineffective against
many types of cruise missile and drone threats.

U.S. defense leaders have gradually adopted a new emphasis over the last
decade on a holistic concept called "missile defeat." and then than
narrowly focusing on kinetic kill options to deny adversary attacks,
missile defeat involves using the entire spectrum of options to prevent
and defeat missile threats, from countering proliferation to early
indications and warning and, of course, detection, tracking, and
intercepting cruise missiles. It also seeks to integrate defensive,
offensive, passive, kinetic, and non-kinetic capabilities, such as cyber
warfare, directed energy, and electronic attack.

NORAD/**[NORTHCOM embraces this new emphasis on domain awareness and
information dominance]{.underline}**. **[[Early detection of a potential
threat can open up decision space for U.S. leaders]{.mark}, [enabling
moves]{.mark} left-of-launch or even left-of-conflict [to reduce the
risk of an attack in the first place]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As VanHerck
notes, "If I'm shooting down cruise missiles and ballistic missiles,
we've failed in deterrence, and that's not where we want to be."
**[[Domain awareness]{.mark} and information dominance]{.underline}**
likewise [**[remain]{.underline}** **[prerequisites for any actions to
defeat missiles]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[right-of-launch]{.underline}**---after kinetic or non-kinetic attacks
have occurred.

However, the new emphasis on domain awareness and information dominance
is not without challenges. VanHerck testified to Congress that [**[the
missile defeat approach]{.underline}**, **[which favors
detection]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[over tracking and
countering]{.underline}**, **[[is at risk because of a sheer lack of
capabilities in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The January 2023
intrusion of a Chinese spy balloon into U.S. airspace by way of
northwest Canada caught the nation off-guard and highlighted this severe
lack of domain awareness in the Arctic. VanHerck told lawmakers: "We are
not organized, trained or equipped to respond in the Arctic."

Another Arctic expert, Ketil **[Olsen]{.underline}**, formerly Norway's
military representative in NATO and the European Union, who now heads
Andoeya Space, a Norwegian state-controlled company that tests new
military and surveillance technologies, **[called the region "a dark
area on the map]{.underline}**." **[[The lack of domain awareness
prevents the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from obtaining the early
warning and]{.mark} intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
([ISR]{.mark}) [info]{.mark}rmation [necessary to]{.mark} anticipate and
take actions to [deter]{.mark} air and cruise [missile
attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The Arctic has remained an attractive attack vector
for]{.underline}** both U.S. and **[Russian long-range aviation and
missiles]{.underline}** since the earliest days of the Cold War. **[[The

significantly]{.underline}** over the past 30 years. **[[China or Russia

[**[The strategic utility of an Arctic presence is]{.underline}**
**[considerable]{.underline}** **[for early warning
purposes]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[[Its]{.mark} geographical [location
makes the Arctic]{.mark} an]{.underline}** **[[important]{.mark} vantage
point]{.underline}** **[[for monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** potential
ballistic **[missile launches and]{.underline}** other **[airborne
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**.12 **[[Russia and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates---with
its allies---**[[depend on Arctic infrastructure for]{.mark} their
[early warning]{.mark} systems]{.underline}**, both
**[through]{.underline}** ground-based **[radars and ground
stations]{.underline}** for satellite communications (SATCOM). Russia
and China are increasingly collaborating in developing defense
technology, decidedly prioritizing space and new technologies, and it is
with Russia's cooperation that China is seeking to develop and deploy
its own early warning infrastructure.13

More broadly, **[with their increasing dependence on space-based
capabilities for advanced warfare, [states seeking]{.mark} global or
[Arctic]{.mark} regional [coverage]{.mark}]{.underline}** for their
space systems **[[are reliant on ground infrastructure]{.mark} in the
Arctic due to its latitude-restricting coverage]{.underline}**.14
**[[The Arctic is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[an ideal location for
this type of infrastructure.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Particularly **[for
states with ambitions of global space-power projection such as
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and China]{.underline}**, **[this incentivizes a growing physical
presence in the Arctic]{.underline}** to support developing space
infrastructure, including dual-use projects.15 China has advanced its
global space capabilities drastically in recent years, and reports have
emerged that Russia is becoming reliant on Chinese satellite imagery of
Ukraine.16 Moreover, the geopolitical tension between NATO and Russia
heightens the risk for assets such as Norway's K-SAT satellite station
on Svalbard and the space-launch capabilities in Andøya, Norway, and
Kiruna, Sweden.17

#### Arctic war escalates through conventional, gray-zone, and accidental warfare

**Wallin 25**, ASP's Chief Executive Officer and Masters in Public
Diplomacy at USC. (Matthew, 5-12-2025, "Is the Arctic Destined to be the
Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear War?"
https://www.americansecurityproject.org/is-the-arctic-destined-to-be-the-most-likely-flashpoint-for-a-nuclear-war/)
wtk

**[[Amidst]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
**[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[melting]{.mark} polar [ice is
opening Arctic sea lanes to increased]{.mark}]{.underline}** shipping
traffic, resource exploration, and **[[military
posturing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO's newest members, Finland and
Sweden, are Arctic nations. **[Russia]{.underline}** currently
**[dominates the Arctic]{.underline}** region, holding 53% of its total
coastline, operating the world's biggest icebreaker fleet, and has been
upgrading its Arctic military bases. **[China is also increasingly
playing a role]{.underline}**, conducting joint Arctic military
exercises with Russia and employing an icebreaker fleet of its own,
despite its complete lack of territory in the Arctic Circle.

But is the Arctic destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war? Let's look at the possibilities.

Despite being so cold, **[[the]{.mark} Arctic is no stranger to military
conflict]{.underline}**, **[holding]{.underline}** **[major strategic
value]{.underline}** and serving **[as a passageway to both the Atlantic
and Pacific]{.underline}**. During World War II, the Battle of the
Atlantic extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war
supplies to the Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany
invaded Norway, and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War
of 1940. As the Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a major theater for
submarine activity.

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland "one way or
the other" highlights the growing importance of the Arctic to the
security interests of the United States. **[Greenland's [geographic
location]{.mark}]{.underline}**, combined with the U.S.' operation of
Pituffik Space Base in the high north, **[[provides
key]{.mark}]{.underline}** "**[[missile warning]{.mark}, missile
defense, [and]{.mark} space [surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}**"
**[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The shortest flight paths
for nuclear missiles]{.mark} between the U.S. and Russia [exist over the
Arctic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the loss of this base on
account of a diplomatic blunder could open a key blind spot in America's
strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian
attack aimed at disabling American missile detection infrastructure is
unlikely due to the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.

Currently, **[[the most likely path to a]{.mark} potential [nuclear
exchange in the Arctic would be through]{.mark} a conventional or "[gray
zone]{.mark}" Russian [attack]{.mark} on a NATO member]{.underline}**.
**[[Border skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace incursions]{.mark},
reckless military intercepts, and support to separatist
groups]{.underline}** intentionally sit in the "gray zone" between peace
and outright war, but **[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultimately
**[[lead to open conflict that escalates to nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Conceivably, a gray zone or overt attack on
other Greelandic infrastructure, or an information operations campaign
aimed at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not outside of
the realm of possibility.

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland---which
shares a 1,343 km border with Russia---**[[there is increased
opportunity that a NATO Arctic state could be
attacked]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Highlighting this risk, American forces
in Alaska recently staged a drill in which hundreds of troops were flown
to Finland to defend against a mock Russian invasion. Yet rather than an
overt invasion of a NATO member, **[Russia is far more likely test the
waters by conducting]{.underline}** provocative and destabilizing
small-scale **[gray zone activities.]{.underline}** The disastrous
results of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in
Moscow about its ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on
a nuclear armed country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct
attack unlikely. It is not entirely clear where the red line on gray
zone activities would be for Finland or what would trigger an Article 5
collective defense declaration short of a direct attack across the
border.

Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter a
Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing doubt about his willingness to defend a
NATO member that comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe
about America's commitment. As a result, France and the UK are
considering expanding their arsenals, signifying an increased reliance
on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic
NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it wants to decommission
its current warheads as it brings replacements online, potentially
doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an
airbase closer to the German border to be able to host nuclear weapons.
The UK, which has been historically dependent on the U.S. for its
nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning that dependence, and may seek
other options to assure an effective and reliable deterrent. This could
foretell a new nuclear arms race.

The upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the last remaining
strategic nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, portends a
period of nuclear proliferation that could echo the nuclear arms
buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, China, which has been operating in
the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid nuclear buildup in an
effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by 2035. China has
consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral nuclear arms
reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its comparatively much
smaller nuclear arsenal.

**[[Navigation issues]{.mark} in the Arctic
[could]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[lead to military escalations
reaching the nuclear level]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The]{.underline}**
Global Navigation Satellite System (**[GNSS]{.underline}**), **[which
includes satellite constellations like the American GPS
system]{.underline}** or Russian GLONASS, **[sees decreased reliability
and accuracy in the Arctic]{.underline}**. The reasons for this are
abundant, like the orbital inclination of the satellites themselves and
ionospheric interference. With increased incidents of Russian GNSS
jamming in Europe, it's conceivable that Russia may employ similar
tactics in the Arctic, including spoofing, for the purpose of disruption
or causing navigational errors to trigger an exploitable international
incident. Military or civilian **[[vessels straying into Russian
territory could be captured]{.underline}]{.mark}**, their cargoes
**[seized]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}** crews **[held
hostage]{.underline}** for the purpose of conducting hostage diplomacy.
**[[Resolving such a confrontation military could quickly spiral out of
control.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising.

The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power. Though he has not signaled any specific intent to attack,
President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be capable of invading
Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated his intention to
directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump appears to defer
to the traditional American position of strategic ambiguity over the
island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to defend
Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a nuclear
weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S. mainland
or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack on Chinese
mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.

**[What is most concerning is that [provocative military behavior
anywhere could lead to]{.mark} an unintentional cycle of escalation that
ultimately results in a [nuclear exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[As
the Arctic opens to more]{.mark} military and commercial
[activity]{.mark}, [the frequency of encounters]{.mark} between military
forces [is likely to increase]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As those
encounters increase, [**[so too does the probability that
an]{.underline}** **[accident or unintended
attack]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[may occur]{.underline}**. As Russia
routinely flies patrols into the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone,
an area of international air space in which the U.S. identifies all
aircraft, aggressive behavior by Russian pilots raises the risk of a
routine encounter evolving into an international incident. But these
**[aggressive incidents are]{.underline}** much more
**[frequent]{.underline}** elsewhere, like the Baltic and North Seas.
For example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two missiles
against a British RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea, but
fortunately neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is known
for conducting frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in the
East and South China Seas.

### A2 - Competition

#### Increased domain awareness is key to US-Canada-Japan-Korea cooperation over shipping routes in the Arctic which cements Western leadership over norms

**[Russian state-owned nuclear energy corporation]{.underline}**
**[Rosatom and]{.underline}** **[Chinese shipping company]{.underline}**
**[Hainan]{.underline}** Yangpu NewNew Shipping
**[announced]{.underline}** in 2024 that **[they would cooperate on
operating an all-year-round container shipping route through the
Arctic]{.underline}**. Since then, shipping interruptions at flashpoints
from the Panama Canal to the Red Sea have thrown the global economy into
turmoil. Worse, **[[increasing military]{.mark} and technological
[collaboration between Beijing and Moscow has escalated]{.mark} the
[security threats]{.mark} facing the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies.

**[To counter this cooperation, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[should
consider]{.underline}]{.mark}** working with its Canadian allies to open
and maintain an equivalent shipping route --- [**[an]{.underline}**
"**[Ice Canal]{.underline}**" **[across the Northwest
Passage]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- **[to bolster their commercial and
strategic presence in the region.]{.underline}**

All-**[[year-round shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}** through the Arctic
**[would require]{.underline}** **[significant
infrastructure]{.underline}** and promises high costs for fuel,
equipment, and manpower. But these investments would generate
considerable economic returns. The Northwest Passage can reduce shipping
distance between London and Tokyo by about 3,780 nautical miles, or
approximately 7,000 kilometers. And **[[the]{.mark} priceless [strategic
benefits]{.mark} of bolstering U.S. and allied nuclear security should
[incentivize public cooperation with the private
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**, defraying costs further.

Moscow and Beijing recognize the region's significance. Their agreement
involves building five ice-class container ships and investing in
infrastructure such as deep-water ports and refueling and repair
facilities along the Northern Sea Route along Russia's Arctic coastline.
These **[container ships are dual-use]{.underline}**, meaning they can
be used for commercial purposes and military sealift operations such as
weapons systems and troop transport. **[The initiative signals that
Russia and China prioritize regional mobility, allowing them to
cooperate on increasing the profitability of Russia's Arctic coastline
and on strategic interoperability across the region.]{.underline}**

[**[A competing dual-use project]{.underline}**, **[led by the
U.S.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and Canada, [would help engage Japan,
South]{.mark} Korea, and other Arctic NATO allies [in strategic and
economic cooperation across the region]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[The first step to opening this route is to find out what we do not
know]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Because very few people have been to the
Northwest Passage in winter, **[[assessments are largely based on
theoretical models]{.mark} and historical and satellite
data]{.underline}**. **[These means of data collection are insufficient
to create a reliable and detailed map of the geographical and seasonal
shipping challenges]{.underline}**. [**[Shipping along the Northwest
Passage will require initial efforts to]{.underline}** **[map sea ice
movements]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[wind
patterns]{.underline}**]{.mark} throughout the year.

Canada has 20 vessels in its icebreaker fleet, two of which are heavy
icebreakers. These are expected to be replaced with two new polar
vessels capable of operating in moderate multiyear ice conditions in
2030. To complement research, approximately five years of all-year-round
icebreaker presence is needed to map the geographical locations and
timing of choke points created by multiyear ice and wind patterns.

The data collected by the icebreaker presence will be used to identify
locations for deploying unmanned aerial vehicles or helicopters
supplying ice and weather data to vessels and aircraft transiting the
Northwest Passage. Icebreakers will be on call all year round to assist
vessels transiting ice choke points. This would allow for safe
all-year-round passage of container ships and give U.S. and Canadian
forces invaluable real-world experience operating jointly and across
domains in Arctic conditions.

Additionally, a permanent Western presence along the Northwest Passage
would give U.S. and allied militaries invaluable situational awareness
and the ability to respond swiftly to the outbreak of conflict in
critical strategic areas. This is particularly important because the
shortest routes for Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles are
through the poorly surveilled airspace north of the Arctic Circle.

In the Atlantic, **[the Greenland--Iceland--United Kingdom gap and the
Barents Sea are the primary strategic locations for Russian
nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines]{.underline}**.
**[[Insufficient underwater surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in these
areas, **[as well as the Bear Gap between Norwegian Svalbard and
Scandinavia and along Greenland's east coast]{.underline}**, [**[allows
Russian SSBNs]{.underline}** **[more freedom to operate
undetected]{.underline}**, **[strengthening Russia's second-strike

[weakening U.S. deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

On the eastern end of the supercontinent, **[the Bering
Strait]{.underline}** --- the entrance to the Pacific between Russia and
Alaska --- **[has become a critical chokepoint]{.underline}**. **[Russia
has fitted submarine bases near its eastern port]{.underline}** city of
Vladivostok **[with hardened shelter pens]{.underline}** and additional
repair and maintenance facilities to avoid dependency on Barents Sea
facilities. **[Russian-Chinese base-sharing arrangements]{.underline}**
at the entrance to the North Pacific **[strengthen
interoperability]{.underline}**. **[And Beijing and Moscow have signaled
their willingness to extend cooperation to their strategic nuclear
forces with a joint air patrol with four nuclear-capable bombers in
Alaska's air defense identification zone.]{.underline}**

CHINA ANGLING FOR 'INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH GREENLAND,' INTEL COMMUNITY
SAYS

A container route along the Northwest Passage would do much to establish
presence, connectivity, and interoperability between Canada, the U.S.,
and other allies with Arctic interests and represent an important
countermove to Russia-China collaboration. Canadian leadership in
establishing and operating the new container route is advisable to avoid
ramping up international tensions, thanks to its rights and
responsibilities as a coastal state.

**[[As Moscow and Beijing prepare for dual-use
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the Barents Sea to the Bering

The Arctic Quad's Collective Strength

**[[To counter]{.underline}]{.mark}** these [**[escalating

and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[South [Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
two pivotal treaty **[allies with strategic interests and unique
capabilities that could bolster Arctic security]{.underline}**.

First, [**[the two countries' engagement can]{.underline}**
**[significantly bolster]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [defense]{.mark}
capabilities [of the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Tokyo
has been playing a leadership role in promoting maritime security norms
and environmental stewardship.]{.underline}** **[[By lending]{.mark} its
world-class [ocean radar and remote sensor
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- refined over decades by heavy
reliance on fishing and regular confrontations with natural disasters
--- **[[Japan can significantly enhance]{.underline}]{.mark}** Canada's
**[[monitoring]{.mark} capability]{.underline}**. The Canadians recently
announced a plan to invest \$1.4 billion over 20 years to improve Arctic
maritime sensors.

**[[South Korea]{.mark}, a shipbuilding titan that outcompetes
China]{.underline}**, **[may [hold the key to accelerating the
modernization of aging allied Arctic maritime
fleets]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Plus, as Canada has vowed to spend \$18.4
billion over 20 years to acquire a more modernized tactical helicopter
capability in the Arctic, South Korea with its advanced arms
manufacturing can help there too.

Such **[[deeper]{.mark} defense-industrial [collaboration would fortify
Arctic security architectures]{.mark} while deepening military
interoperability]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[[pooling efforts within
multilateral governance bodies would enable the US-led democratic
coalition to]{.mark} collectively [shape the north
Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Coordinating positions in forums like
the Arctic Council and Trilateral Summit between Japan, South Korea and
China would safeguard their converging interests as the Arctic's future
contours are determined.

What about the benefits to Tokyo and Seoul?

**[South Korea had been heavily reliant on Russia in implementing Arctic
developmental projects]{.underline}** before the Ukraine war, and now
needs to find other options. Th**[e burgeoning military alliance between
Russia and North Korea]{.underline}** --- including arms transfers and
potential missile technology-sharing --- **[poses unacceptable
risks]{.underline}**. **[[Russia's reliance on Pyongyang]{.mark} amid
its international isolation [renders continued cooperation with Moscow
untenable for Seoul]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Concurrently, [the deepening Sino-Russian axis]{.mark}]{.underline}**
fueled by Beijing's tacit backing of the Ukraine invasion **[[portends
long-term dangers for Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From Tokyo's
perspective, **[Chinese economic encroachment into the Russian Arctic
represents the leading edge of a broader expansionist agenda that could
fatally undermine Japan's regional security]{.underline}** down the
road.

**[Given these factors, [all four countries should]{.mark} come to
[realize]{.mark} that formal and [robust coordination]{.mark} between
like-minded states [is needed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even when direct
military provision may be unfeasible, **[[Seoul and Tokyo can still
contribute through defense cooperation]{.mark} focused [on]{.mark} areas
like [maritime security]{.mark} and cold-weather
operations]{.underline}** --- [**[signaling a commitment

#### Global authoritarianism causes extinction---only strong influence by democratic states solve

Worlds Collapse: What History, Systems, and Complexity Can Teach Us
About Our Modern World and Fragile Future*, p. 74-76. Accessed online

**[[A world dominated by totalitarian states would
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** more incompetent, **[[more war-prone]{.mark},
less cooperative]{.underline}**, and more inhibitive of progress
**[[than]{.mark} one dominated by [democratic
states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our current world is not particularly
competent, peaceful, cooperative, or progressive---a
totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. **[[It would increase the
risk of]{.mark} another [collapse and extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and could shape the future toward less desirable trajectories
(Beckstead, 2013).

**[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline}** (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to
risks of collapse and extinction.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if ever) go to
war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [**[a world dominated
by democracies has fewer wars]{.underline}**.
**[Miscalc]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ulation [might
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** [a]{.mark} particular **[[problem for
totalitarian states due to personalization and disincentives for
accurate info]{.mark}rmation,]{.underline}** leading to well-known
strategic disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II
(Bialer, 1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam
Hussein's rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). **[[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark}** collapse and **[[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [being used]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Linked to this, **[[totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.mark}
than democratic states]{.underline}**. While cooperation is possible
(Ginsburg, 2020), **[their [internal norms are characterized by
paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline}** and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
**[[This is bad for]{.mark} all [risks that require cooperation such
as]{.mark} [pandemics or climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, **[continued social and [scientific progress is likely to
reduce risks of]{.mark}]{.underline}** collapse and
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Social progress could reduce
global inequality and other risk factors. **[[Scientific progress could
help address natural risks and climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Sandberg, 2018), differentially increase defensive rather than
offensive power (Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), **[[and solve safety
challenges in AI or biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology (Russell,
2019). **[[However,]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we will now discuss
**[[totalitarian states would likely inhibit social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, **[democracies have space for cosmopolitan values
such as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better
than those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}**. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. **[A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline}** on
the other hand, **[would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---distorting the human trajectory.]{.underline}**

**[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which
values are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}**" **[some]{.underline}** particular set of
(possibly far from optimal) **[values]{.underline}**. While they are
currently faroff, **[future technologies such as artificial general
intelligence, space settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much
better surveillance could enable lock-in]{.underline}** (Caplan,
2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

**[[A]{.mark} long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world
would]{.mark} extend the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened risk of collapse or extinction, as well as increased
potential for distortion of the human trajectory and the possibility
that a "[lock-in"]{.mark} event may occur]{.underline}**. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," [**[resulting in a
trajectory]{.underline}** **[with less or no scientific and social
progress]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and a less favorable geopolitical
situation, [which would threaten the destruction of humanity]{.mark}'s
longterm potential]{.underline}**.

Over the past several decades, **[[the missile threat to the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[has
[evolved]{.mark} in ways that complicate defense of the
homeland]{.underline}**. Ballistic missiles have been seen as the weapon
of choice for states seeking to reign terror upon an adversary, as they
are difficult to counter. Today, **[more than 30 countries possess
ballistic missiles]{.underline}** of varying ranges and capabilities.
**[Yet, the [ballistic missile threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[has
been augmented by]{.underline}**]{.mark} newer, **[more
sophisticated]{.underline}**, types of **[missiles]{.underline}** that
are even more difficult to counter. **[These include [hypersonic]{.mark}
missiles, [cruise]{.mark} [missiles]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} other types of
unmanned aerial systems like [drones]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the 2022
Missile Defense Review noted, "missile-related threats have rapidly
expanded in quantity, diversity and sophistication. U.S. national
security interests are increasingly at risk from wide-ranging missile
arsenals that include offensive ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic
weapons...."\[2\] And as one former Biden Administration official put it
more starkly in congressional testimony, "Offensive missiles are
increasingly weapons of choice for Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran,
for use in conflict and to coerce and intimidate their neighbors."\[3\]

**[[The growing threat]{.mark} of faster, longer-range, and more
deadly]{.underline}** ballistic, cruise, hypersonic, and other unmanned
**[missiles]{.underline}** and systems **[[means that the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is
increasingly at risk of more complex missile
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including those employing sophisticated
countermeasures. As one study concluded:

**[Defenses for the homeland have largely focused on long-range
ballistic threats]{.underline}**, while cruise missile defense and other
air defense efforts have focused on regional and force protection
applications to the exclusion of the homeland. The lingering
homeland-regional dichotomy creates a vulnerability that near-peer
adversaries are seeking to exploit.\[4\]

Consequently, **[[missile defense]{.mark} of the U.S. homeland [must
address]{.mark} these [multiple types of threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
either singly or in combination, on an urgent basis.

**[[The high north is becoming an increasingly attractive vector for
Russian and Chinese missile strikes]{.mark} on the U.S.
homeland]{.underline}**. More than half the Arctic coastline is
sovereign Russian territory.19 **[[Russia is modernizing]{.mark} its
military bases and airfields]{.underline}**, deploying new coastal air
defenses and submarines, and increasing its military exercises and
training within its 5th Military District, Moscow's Arctic combatant
command.20 **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** now self identifies as a
"near-Arctic state," **[has [expanded]{.mark} Arctic scientific research
[activities that have military applications]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
invested more than \$90 billion in Arctic infrastructure projects, and
stated its intent to build a "polar silk road."21

**[[Moscow and Beijing can exploit]{.mark} their [Arctic footholds to
launch air and cruise missile strikes]{.mark} that can reach targets in
nearly every U.S. state]{.underline}**. Growing U.S. Government concern
about cruise missile threats emanating from northern approaches is
reflected in DOD's 2022 Missile Defense Strategy, which identifies the
U.S.-Canada partnership through NORAD as the backbone of efforts to
improve early warning surveillance of "increasingly sophisticated
conventional missile capabilities that are able to target critical
infrastructure in North America."22

Over the last three decades, conventional missiles of all types have
become weapons of choice for U.S. adversaries. Since the 1990s, **[China
and Russia have explored options to employ long-range, conventional
weapons to deter U.S. leaders without provoking a nuclear
response]{.underline}**. Chinese doctrine describes precision strikes as
a means of "war control" to manage escalation and frames powerprojection
nodes, such as Air Force and Navy bases in Guam that are in the range of
China's DF-26 ballistic missiles, as sources of U.S. vulnerability in
warfare.23 In 2017, China deployed its DF-17 ballistic missile,
reportedly with approval from Moscow, along its border with Russia where
it could reach the U.S. homeland via the polar region while remaining
outside the range of Navy Aegis anti-ballistic missile ships in the
Pacific.24 **[[Missile warfare is]{.mark} becoming [a premier means for
Russia to project power]{.mark}]{.underline}**; in Ukraine, Russia has
launched hundreds of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as suicide
drones, targeting power grids and other critical infrastructure in an
attempt to force Kyiv into a settlement.25

**[Given adversaries' growing interest in employing missiles for a
quick, low-cost advantage, it's perhaps not surprising that
[missile]{.mark}-related [threats]{.mark} to the U.S. homeland
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as the 2022 Missile Defense Review noted,
"**[[rapidly expanded in quantity, diversity, and
sophistication]{.underline}]{.mark}**."26 **[Modern conventional cruise
missiles are]{.underline}** the most rapidly growing threat in terms of
numbers and employment because they are **[harder to detect, track,

**[As [the Russia-China axis]{.mark}]{.underline}** further
**[[aligns]{.mark} itself [against the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
its NATO allies, **[the power struggle has [expanded
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** a new, previously ice-locked frontier: **[[the
Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

When American fighters intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers
in the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over Alaska in July,
the unprecedented move underscored this increasingly assertive and
expansive partnership. And while Beijing and Moscow have been working to
establish a strategic foothold in the region for more than a decade,
Washington and Brussels are just now waking up to the threat.

**[The clock is ticking]{.underline}**, and the West is on thin ice.

Just **[[how important the Arctic is to Russia in terms
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** maintaining its **[threatening [nuclear
posture]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[toward the U.S. [cannot be
overstated]{.mark}. In a nuclear exchange, [Moscow would]{.mark} likely
[fire]{.mark} long-range ballistic [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
from ballistic missile submarine bases near the Kola Peninsula ---
**[through the poorly surveyed airspace [over
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[[hindered by low
visibility]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}**, **[[U.S. forces would
be ill-prepared to detect and counter the strike.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Russia has been building up this Arctic force since]{.underline}**
its **[2014]{.underline}** invasion of Crimea. In its efforts, melting
sea ice has presented both opportunities and challenges for the country.
On the one hand, the economic importance of Russia's Arctic coastline is
growing because of its commercialization as a feasible shipping route,
allowing Moscow to profit from providing short shipping routes for
commercial vessels carrying cargo between Asia and Europe. However, more
traffic also means Russia's control of its vast Arctic coastline ---
stretching from the Barents Sea in the west to the Bering Strait in the
east --- is now threatened.

So, **[using a dense network of air defense, aviation and ground forces
at its Northern Fleet bases, [Russia]{.mark} has been focusing on
closing off access to the Kola Peninsula]{.underline}** at the Barents
Sea **[to protect its strategic submarine force and preserve the fleet's
year-round access to the Atlantic]{.underline}**. **[It has also
[invested]{.mark} heavily [in precision]{.mark}-guided [missile
tech]{.mark}nology to threaten distant targets and achieve sea denial
without having to deploy traditional naval or air forces.]{.underline}**

Additionally, **[in order to maintain and operate a strategic submarine
force near Alaska]{.underline}** without relying on Northern Fleet
repair facilities at the other end of Eurasia, **[Russia has constructed
new hardened submarine shelter pens]{.underline}** and repair and
maintenance facilities south of the Bering Strait near Vladivostok.

Amid all this, **[as]{.underline}** further **[evidence of its
"no-limits" partnership with Russia]{.underline}**, **[[China has been
developing its dual-use Arctic capabilities too]{.mark}, [bolstering
Russia's ability to threaten the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}** and its
NATO allies **[while diverting attention from the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. It has also increased its regional civilian
and military cooperation with Moscow, linking its polar Silk Road to the
Russian Arctic by investing in infrastructure.

**[As it stands, [China's]{.mark} polar satellites, [unmanned]{.mark}
underwater [vehicles]{.mark} and research vessels]{.underline}** ---
three of which are icebreakers --- **[[give Beijing an edge]{.mark}d in
terms of tracking shipping routes, mapping the Arctic seabed and
monitoring sea-ice and aerial movements]{.underline}**. And with the
joint venture between Russia's state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom
and China's Hainan Yangpu NewNew Shipping company, **[the two countries
will now cooperate on building infrastructure and ice-class container
vessels to operate a year-round Arctic route]{.underline}**. The
collaboration empowers Moscow to monitor and control activities along
its Arctic coastline, and to better protect Russian ballistic missile
submarines as well.

Risks of the Legacy Approach to U.S. Missile Defense in the Arctic

The legacy air and missile defense paradigm is intuitive for U.S.
military operators who have been trained to use kinetic capabilities to
kill threats including drones and cruise missiles.55 While these
capabilities are important and need to be urgently modernized, an
overreliance on kinetic kill platforms, delivery systems, and weapons
alone could lead to a reactive strategy that limits warfighter options.
**[[Betting on successful missile intercepts alone is]{.mark} a
particularly [risky]{.mark} choice [given]{.mark} the area defense
requirements of [the Arctic]{.mark}, which]{.underline}**, much like the
contiguous United States, is a vast expanse that **[[requires a
comprehensive missile defeat approach.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In the legacy missile defense paradigm, there are three essential
elements to an air and cruise missile defense system: sensors, battle
management systems, and shooters. The role of sensors is to detect,
track, and identify inbound air and cruise missile threats; battle
management systems coordinate defensive actions; and shooters, such as
fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, or non-kinetic capabilities
like electromagnetic warfare and high-powered microwave weapons, destroy
the incoming threats.56

Air defense for the contiguous United States is now provided by a
network of ground-based radars---including those in the North Warning
System---and a small number of fighters on air defense alert at several
air bases around the country. These fighters are on alert status to
rapidly respond to and intercept foreign military aircraft, such as
Russian bomber patrols that routinely fly near and occasionally into
U.S. airspace. Air Force fighters also intercept unidentified aircraft,
aircraft that have strayed from planned flight paths, and aircraft that
are not properly communicating with air traffic control.

In practice, **[the small numbers of fighters and the lack of a system
of sensors that can detect low-flying targets over long ranges limits
the system's effectiveness against modern cruise missiles and other
threats]{.underline}**. Air defense systems like the kinds being used in
Ukraine also offer some defense against low-volume missile
attacks---systems such as Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD), or the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System
(NASAMS), which is used to defend the Washington DC national capital
region. But these systems are low-density, high-demand assets, may cost
more per shot than the missiles they defend against, and are not
effective against many types of cruise missile and drone threats.57

Benefits & Risks of a New Missile Defeat Paradigm

Because of historically limited interest and investment in cruise
missile defense concepts and technologies, **[[the U.S. military]{.mark}
now [has very little capability to detect]{.mark}, track, identify or
intercept [cruise missiles and other aerial strikes]{.mark} on the U.S.
homeland]{.underline}**.58 **[To overcome this]{.underline}** inertia,
NORAD/**[NORTHCOM]{.underline}** **[has embraced a new paradigm that
emphasizes domain awareness]{.underline}** and information dominance as
the foundation of its missile defeat approach.59 The argument is that
early detection of a potential threat can open up decision space for
U.S. leaders so they can make moves left of launch or even left of
conflict to reduce the risk of an attack in the first place. As Gen
VanHerck has said, "If I'm shooting down cruise missiles and ballistic
missiles, we've failed in deterrence and that's not where we want to
be."60

**[[Domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and information dominance
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**[prerequisites]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** **[any actions]{.underline}** **[to defeat
missiles right of launch]{.underline}**]{.mark}: after kinetic or
non-kinetic attacks have occurred. Short-range point defenses
surrounding a particular location and longer-range area defenses are
important for selected homeland military and civilian infrastructure
because they can further bolster deterrence and protect U.S. power
projection capability. **[But an over-emphasis on the "counter" element
in the detect-track-counter kill chain is not a recipe for success due
to the escalatory risks relative to stopping or preventing attacks in
the first place]{.underline}**. Another consideration is the technical
difficulty and expense associated with building a defense system that
has the capacity to even handle the high volume of increasingly
sophisticated cruise missiles that can be launched at the United States,
much less launch counterattacks.

**[[In a missile defeat architecture that favors domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and information dominance, **[[the
Arctic plays a central role]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In his March 2023
testimony to Congress, Gen VanHerck paraphrased Billy Mitchell's
comments about Alaska being the most strategic location on the planet
and reminded senators that **[[the Arctic is the most direct route for
missile attacks from Russia, China, and]{.mark} North
[Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[with sea ice receding,
China and Russia are increasingly able to deploy missile-carrying
submarines into the region.]{.underline}**61 However, the new emphasis
on domain awareness and information dominance is not without risks. Gen
VanHerck noted in his testimony that the missile defeat approach, which
favors detection over tracking and countering, is at risk because of a
sheer lack of capabilities in the Arctic.

Yeah, well said by Mathieu. I think you know to for me to hone it
specifically, right, I will re emphasize what Mathieu said numerous
times all domain awareness, and I know we say that a lot in many
reasons, but **[[it is really]{.mark}, really [important to have all
domain awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the sea bed through the sea
onto the land, into the air, in the electromagnetic spend, the spectrum,
sensing those signals that go through that. **[This would be
used]{.underline}** right **[for many things,]{.underline}**
**[[to]{.mark} [include]{.mark} indications and [warning of]{.mark} any
particularly large movement or [threatening
movement]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[but also for attribution
and]{.mark} to help other things like [mapping]{.mark} and understanding
borders]{.underline}**, etc. I also think a **[capabilities that come
together in a coherent and integrated way]{.underline}** that lend to a
broader political strategy that **[could include a drum beat of regular
presence, a demonstration of capability]{.underline}**, exercising,
training that actually show that the nations and the Alliance are
together, ready to be aware of what's going on and ready to respond to
what's going on in order to quickly move forces and then the logistics
and sustainment, which should not ever be overlooked in anything like
that. For NATO planning, I mentioned the regional plans earlier, and how
the concepts for deterrence and defense of the Euro-Atlantic area, they
take into account regions and areas of the transatlantic alliance, and
the Arctic and the High North is clearly one of those. And so **[these
[plans help bring coherence to the entire picture in a 360 degree view,
all domain]{.mark}, all encompassing view, [to where everything is
integrated and interoperable]{.mark} and working together in a way that
created the deterrent effect that the alliance is trying to create, and
certainly capabilities that lend to the high north and into the Arctic
are going to be very important to that.]{.underline}**

Arctic Threats"

**[Analyzing the risks and opportunities]{.underline}** in the Arctic,
**[the Mitchell Institute]{.underline}** for Aerospace Studies has
**[developed a framework for a layered missile defeat approach in the
Arctic, with particular emphasis on left-of-launch detection and
tracking.]{.underline}**

**[The first layer is [regional threat awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[consisting of networked sensors]{.mark} operating in multiple
domains to [provide early]{.mark} indications and [warning]{.mark} of
potential threats]{.underline}**. Adversaries may show signs of intent
by making force posture changes and logistical preparations in the days,
weeks, and even months prior to an attack. Today for instance, Russia is
building up its military bases in range of Alaska. **[[By tracking
activities]{.mark} that could be a prelude to hostilities, U.S. [leaders
could be better equipped to manage the threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
providing more time and options for the United States to deter or
prevent an attack.

**[[ISR]{.mark} satellite [assets]{.mark} that can be used to map out
activity and detect changes in adversary behavior [are]{.mark} one
obvious and [attractive solution to improve]{.mark} indications and
[warning in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Already, commercial
companies and U.S. partners and allies operating satellites with Arctic
coverage could help fill current DOD satellite gaps.

DOD and Congress: Next Steps

**[To create the capabilities needed for this multi-layered defense,
[Congress]{.mark} and DOD [must]{.mark} work together to:]{.underline}**

**[[Establish a]{.mark} Joint Capability Technology Demonstration
Focused on Cruise Missile Defense]{.underline}** of the Homeland. **[DOD
and Congress should launch a]{.underline}** joint capability technology
demonstration (**[[JCTD]{.underline}]{.mark}**). After acquisition
responsibility for cruise missile defense of the homeland moved from the
Missile Defense Agency to the U.S. Air Force, a previous JCTD to examine
a layered approach to cruise missile defense was scaled down to focus on
the National Capital Region. **[Congress and DOD should fund a broader
JCTD [to experiment with air, space, surface, and subsurface
capabilities]{.mark} that could provide an overlapping, layered cruise
missile defense for the Arctic.]{.underline}**

Create a Dedicated Fund to Bolster Deterrence in the Arctic. A new North
American Deterrence Initiative focused on increasing investments for
cruise missile defeat and bolstering physical military presence in the
Arctic would shift awareness left-of-launch and help to reduce overall
costs of missile defeat. The Congressional Budget Office assessed that a
comprehensive missile defense strategy for the contiguous United States
would cost from \$75 billion to \$465 billion for an architecture with
relatively robust funding for right-of-launch defense. Emphasizing
left-of-launch capabilities in the Arctic might better bolster
deterrence and reduce costs. A second focus of the new fund would be
physical infrastructure improvements, including pre-positioned, hardened
shelters to store aircraft equipment, spares, and other logistics needs,
and modernizing Pituffik Space Base, DOD's northernmost installation
(formerly known as Thule Air Base, in Greenland). Expanding the U.S.
military's physical presence in the Arctic is another key to bolstering
deterrence in the region.

Deepen Ally and Partner Ties to Support Arctic Missile Defeat. The U.S.
Government should strengthen and deepen bilateral and multilateral
relationships with Arctic nations to bolster deterrence against air and
cruise missile threats in the region. Allies have their own incentives
to pursue increased capabilities in the Arctic. Denmark, for example,
has already allocated \$245 million to improve drone surveillance in the
Arctic and is modernizing air surveillance in the Faroe Islands, while
Canada is acquiring new drones for Arctic domain awareness. Norway is
already working with the United States to launch communications
satellite payloads.

In addition, **[[uncrewed aircraft]{.mark} that are operational
today]{.underline}**---such as the MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global
Hawk---**[[can]{.mark} also [contribute to regional threat
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The MQ-9 can carry a variety of
sensors, including maritime surveillance radar and a signals
intelligence payload]{.underline}**. The high-altitude, long-duration
RQ-4 carries a synthetic aperture radar that can persistently map an
adversary's Arctic infrastructure and activities on a persistent basis.
**[[They can also be equipped with defensive payloads]{.mark}, such as
electronic countermeasures, [to help dissuade]{.mark} or prevent
[adversaries from targeting these assets.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[If indications and warnings suggest an adversary is posturing for
missile strikes]{.underline}**, NORAD/**[NORTHCOM]{.underline}**
**[needs the means to track suspected strike platforms]{.underline}** in
the threat detection and attribution phase of the framework. Examples
might include a Russian bomber taking off from an Arctic base where a
ship full of cruise missiles unloaded the week before, or a submarine is
thought to be headed toward Canadian waters.

**[Routine patrols of MQ-9s equipped with maritime surveillance, signals
intelligence, and electro-optical/infrared sensors could be valuable in
helping to identify the number and type of potential
threats]{.underline}**. Likewise, crewed P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol
and reconnaissance aircraft could augment MQ-9 tracking operations.

**[[Once a specific threat is detected, defenses must maintain tracking
custody]{.underline}]{.mark}**; at this threat tracking point, strikes
are expected, and the goal is to provide target-quality data to kinetic
and non-kinetic effectors, which could take action to deter, prevent, or
respond to a missile launch.

Initial air, surface, and subsurface threat detection and attribution
information could be passed to an over- the-horizon radar (OTHR), which
bounces radar energy off the ionosphere to track targets over very long
ranges---up to 4,000 nm. An OTHR could pass target location information
on to other inhabited and uninhabited aircraft and land-based radars in
the North Warning System that can reconfirm the type and number of
threats.

If available, **[airborne [early warning]{.mark} and control aircraft
[could be cued by other sensors to establish a track on airborne threat
aircraft]{.mark} and direct fighters or other effectors to the right
place at the right time to counter those threats if
necessary]{.underline}**. If available, fighter aircraft such as F-35A
Lightning II jets, with their integrated sensor suites, could help track
and intercept missile launch platforms before they could launch their
missiles.

In the absence of available inhabited aircraft, however, it is possible
that an augmented OTHR and the North Warning System could help maintain
custody. Current generation UAVs possess neither the radar capabilities
nor the high speeds needed to keep pace with enemy strike aircraft. But
**[UAVs could be deployed to provide overwatch of likely launch
vectors]{.underline}**, **[accepting cueing data for threats from OTHR
and then using on-board electro-optical and infrared sensors to verify
and characterize threat aircraft.]{.underline}** **[Long-duration UAVs
could employ their maritime surveillance radar to locate and track
potentially hostile ships and could be equipped with sonobuoys to help
monitor submarine threats.]{.underline}**

adversary assets and maneuvers in the region.41 This will require better

**[Th[i]{.mark}s includes developing a comprehensive strategy that
integrates soft and hard power dynamics]{.underline}**, aligns with the
interests of Arctic nations, **[and addresses emerging
threats.]{.underline}** Maintaining a consistent presence in the region
is crucial to deterring adversaries and reassuring allies.

The Way Forward

The inaugural ASDC set a strong foundation for future dialogue and
collaboration on Arctic security. As the region evolves, the need for
proactive, multilateral strategies will only grow more urgent. Moving
forward, **[[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its allies [**[must
focus on closing capability gaps]{.underline}**,]{.mark} enhancing
infrastructure resilience, and addressing hybrid threats. Integrating
Indigenous knowledge and fostering multilateral cooperation will be
essential for navigating the Arctic's uncharted waters. The Arctic's
future is still being written, but one thing is clear: the decisions
made in this decisive decade will shape the region's trajectory for
years to come. The ASDC represents a critical step in ensuring that the
Arctic remains secure, stable, and strategically advantageous for the
U.S. and its allies.

spectrum]{.underline}**---**[how do you prevent and defeat adversary
missiles in all domains]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[along all
timelines]{.underline}** with both kinetic and non-kinetic
capabilities."

**[[Missile defense is a]{.mark}n important [component of missile
defeat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It encompasses the mechanical process of
finding, fixing, tracking, targeting, and, if required, destroying a
hostile missile after it has launched. Missile defense capabilities thus
include everything from missile warning and tracking satellites and
ground-based sensors to electronic warfare, cyber capabilities, and
kinetic interceptors. **[[They do not]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,

### S---Missile Defense---AT: Countermeasures---2AC

#### BMD [solves]{.underline} countermeasures AND [they fail]{.underline}. 

**Costlow 22**, Senior Analyst, National Institute for Public Policy,
Ph.D. Candidate, George Mason (Matthew Costlow, 2022, "Vulnerability is
No Virtue and Defense is No Vice: The Strategic Benefits of Expanded
U.S. Homeland Missile Defense," NIPP, Occasional Paper, Vol. 2, No. 9,
https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OP-Vol.-2-No.-9.pdf)

**["[Countermeasures]{.mark},"]{.underline}** also known as "penetration
aids," are devices designed to **[[lower]{.mark} the [chance]{.mark}
that [an interceptor]{.mark} will]{.underline}** successfully target and
**[[destroy the warhead]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These devices can enable
a number of tactics such as making all potentially threatening objects
look alike to the interceptor and radar **[([such as]{.mark}
"[balloons]{.mark}"]{.underline}** of equal size and shape)
**[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}** actively interfering with the
interceptor's kill vehicle's sensors (**[[jamming]{.mark} or
dazzling]{.underline}**). 90 Countermeasures can technically be deployed
at any stage of a ballistic missile's flight, but are most likely to be
deployed either in the boost-phase or the mid-course since re-entering
the earth's atmosphere in the terminal stage could cause the lighter
countermeasures to have observably different flight patterns than the
heavier (and more likely to be a warhead) objects, on which U.S. missile
defenses could then focus. The great advantage of space-based missile
defense, therefore, is that such a system could potentially intercept
adversary missiles before they deploy countermeasures and multiple
warheads.

**[The most [important]{.mark} factor [to note]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
this regard is that **[the [adversary]{.mark} would likely [need to
include]{.mark} different
[counter]{.mark}measure[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** in its missile's
payload **[that are [optimized]{.mark}]{.underline}** to defeat missile
defenses **[[at each]{.mark} separate [stage of flight]{.mark}.
Including these]{.underline}** different types of **[countermeasures is
a cost [that may impact]{.mark} the total number of warheads a missile
can carry, the missile's [range (due to]{.mark} the added
[weight]{.mark}]{.underline}** of countermeasures), **[and the added
complexity]{.underline}** of the overall system.91 In short, cheap and
lightweight countermeasures may allow for more warheads per missile, but
if the missile interceptors can distinguish the warheads from the
countermeasures, then the warheads are more vulnerable. On the other
hand, relatively expensive and heavy countermeasures that more
accurately resemble a warhead may be more effective in defeating a
missile interceptor, but take up scarce space in the missile payload,
reduce its effective range, and could potentially limit targeting
options.

What then might be the advantages of **["[layering]{.mark}" a U.S.
homeland [missile defense]{.mark} system]{.underline}** in the presence
of adversary countermeasures? The advantages appear to be threefold.
First, having multiple systems that **[[can]{.underline}]{.mark}**
potentially **[make multiple intercept attempts]{.underline}** at each
stage **[[increase]{.mark}s the overall [reliability]{.mark} of the
system]{.underline}**. If, for example, one "layer" of missile defenses
experiences some technical problem, whether temporary or longer-lasting,
the other "layers" can potentially adapt their tactics to compensate.
Second, having multiple "layers" of missile defense increases the
resiliency of the overall system, in case one "layer" is degraded due to
adversary attacks or tactics. Third, having multiple "layers" of missile
defense increases the overall effectiveness of the system by providing
multiple intercept attempts at each stage of the target missile's
flight. For example, **[if there are [three "layers" of]{.mark} U.S.
missile [defense]{.mark} (perhaps boost-phase, mid-course, and
terminal), [and each]{.mark} layer [has]{.mark} a [50 percent
chance]{.mark}]{.underline}** of destroying the adversary missile per
attempt, **[then [there is]{.mark} an [87]{.mark}.5[% chance]{.mark} the
system [will destroy]{.mark} the [warhead]{.mark}
successfully]{.underline}**. If the system provides one more intercept
attempt with a 50 percent chance of success, the overall chance for a
successful kill increases to 94%. Finally, **[[states that]{.mark} wish
to [test]{.mark} potentially advanced [counter]{.mark}measure[s]{.mark}
designed to defeat U.S. missile defenses may seek to test them in a
realistic environment, potentially providing [an opportunity for]{.mark}
U.S. [intelligence]{.mark} assets [to collect info]{.mark}rmation [that
could]{.mark} be used to [make]{.mark} U.S. missile
[interceptors]{.mark} more [effective]{.mark}.]{.underline}**92

Thus, **[having multiple "layers" of missile defense vastly complicates
the difficulties for adversary attack planners, and]{.underline}** more
broadly, **[force planners]{.underline}**, because countermeasures that
may perform well in one stage of flight may not perform well in other
stages. This point, in fact, was well recognized even during the early
days of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as stated by the strategist
Fred S. Hoffman:

> The existence of several different layers of defense would pose a
> complex problem to the offense in the design of countermeasures.
> Approaches that would be most effective against one layer would not in
> general be effective against others, and the existence of different
> types of sensors would pose conflicting requirements on decoys or
> jamming devices. The random attrition that attacking missiles would
> experience in early layers would make it much more difficult to
> concentrate forces on specific targets or to coordinate attacks
> designed to destroy or penetrate later layers. In this respect, a
> multilayer defense is similar to a counterforce attack in
> disorganizing structured attacks but superior in that the defense does
> not have to initiate the conflict.93

**[[Given]{.mark} the [consequences of]{.mark} a [failed coercive
attack]{.mark} on the United States, the [adversary]{.mark} is likely to
[err on]{.mark} the [side of overestimating]{.mark} U.S.
[defense]{.mark} effectiveness, [which]{.mark} in turn, is likely to
[increase]{.mark} the overall [deterrent]{.mark} effect]{.underline}**.
Again, quoting Fred Hoffman, "**[Conservatism is likely to limit their
\[the adversary's\] reliance on clever, relatively cheap, but
questionably effective countermeasures]{.underline}**."94

Then-Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (later, the
Missile Defense Agency), General Ronald Kadish testified in the year
2000, that:

> In other words, **[[countermeasures]{.mark} may be [easy]{.mark}
> science [on paper, but]{.mark} effective ones are not all that simple
> to develop and even [less]{.mark} simple [to implement]{.mark}. The
> [engineering challenges are]{.mark} very [substantial]{.mark}.
> Structural issues can affect [range, accuracy]{.mark} and
> [payload]{.mark}, and [no nation can place confidence]{.mark} in the
> effectiveness of its program without testing]{.underline}**... In my
> view, credible, sophisticated countermeasures are costly, tough to
> develop, and difficult to make effective against our NMD design.
> Simple, cheap attempts can be readily countered by our system.95

In summary, an adversary is unlikely to know all the relevant
capabilities of the U.S. missile defense system, and given the
consequential nature of a coercive attack on the homeland of the
nuclear-armed United States, the adversary is likely to bias its attack
estimates in favor of the United States, thus contributing to
deterrence.

### !---Accidental War---2AC

#### Even if wars don't erupt intentionally, [accidental conflict]{.underline} escalates quickly

(\*Abbie, \*\*Scott, 12-20-2023, "The U.S. Military May Not Be Ready for
Arctic Competition"
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-military-may-not-be-ready-arctic-competition-208075)
wtk

**[[The U.S. needs to better secure]{.mark} its [Arctic]{.mark}
territories and waters]{.underline}**, while working more with its
allies to better secure theirs. **[Although the Arctic has been
relatively peaceful since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}**---a
recurring mantra has been "high latitude, low tensions"---**[U.S[.
military forces need to be prepared for unexpected conflicts that can
erupt quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, like Putin's full-scale invasion
of Ukraine and Hamas' devastating attack on Israel.

The U.S. military's ability to operate effectively in the Arctic is
impeded by various factors. As we described in a recent report, chief
among these are the fact that it has so few assets that can operate in
the region and so little infrastructure there, particularly in
comparison with Russia. **[Increased investments in platforms,
infrastructure]{.underline}**, equipment, **[communications,
[multidomain awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and enhanced tactics and
training **[would [enable the U.S. to better secure its critical
interests]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline}**

These interests span the vast Arctic region: the U.S. needs to work
alongside NATO allies to secure North America's Arctic approaches and
its European allies' long, vulnerable Arctic coastlines and borders with
Russia. It also has a key interest in countering Russian submarines at
the Arctic's edge, where the gaps between Greenland, Iceland, and
Britain are gateways for Russian submarines to enter the Atlantic. The
U.S. also has homeland security responsibilities within its own Arctic
territory and waters, where thousands of Americans live. This area also
harvests roughly half of the nation's seafood, plus substantial amounts
of oil, zinc, and other resources. As sea ice abates during parts of the
year, the Arctic's maritime routes are becoming increasingly important
shortcuts between oceans.

The importance of the region to overall U.S. interests is highlighted in
the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for the Arctic Region,
released in October 2023, and in the 2022 National Security Strategy. It
was also underscored by the U.S. Coast Guard's publication of its Arctic
Strategic Outlook Implementation Plan just a week ago. Although Coast
Guard operations in the Arctic are particularly visible to civilians,
the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Space Force also conduct
training, exercises, and operations there.

**[[Challenges from both Russia and China underscore the urgency of
improving Arctic military capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Russia
was building up its Arctic military and civilian capabilities in the
years before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[This
included re-opening Arctic bases]{.underline}** that had closed after
the Cold War, **[conducting more]{.underline}** extensive training and
**[exercises]{.underline}**, **[stationing more forces in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, and operating more throughout the region**[. It
also has over 50 polar icebreakers]{.underline}**, far more than any
other country. The U.S., by comparison, currently has two, though more
are being acquired.

**[China has also become increasingly involved in the
region.]{.underline}** Both of its polar icebreakers have been
extensively collecting information on the Arctic's physical environment.
**[It has invested]{.underline}**, or tried to invest, **[in Arctic
propertie]{.underline}**s from Greenland and Europe to Siberia, and has
secured the diplomatic status of an observer at the Arctic Council. In
an effort to achieve a greater role in the Arctic, China has alternately
referred to itself as a "near-Arctic state" and to the Arctic as a
shared environment belonging to all nations, neither of which is
accurate. **[Beijing's increasing collaboration with Moscow across all
areas has also been deepening in the Arctic.]{.underline}** The two
countries have operated naval vessels together in the approaches to
Alaska during the last few summers, and also recently signed a maritime
law enforcement agreement that facilitates further Arctic collaboration.

**[For the U.S., [Arctic-specific capabilities are needed because of the
effect of the region's unique environment on
operations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Any system that was not
specifically designed for that environment is likely to
fail]{.underline}**: fuels gel, materials shatter, lubricants freeze,
and batteries do not work. The environment is even harder on people, who
struggle to just to survive in extreme temperatures. Arctic operations
are further impeded by the region's tremendous internal distances and
its remoteness from the rest of the world. Sparse infrastructure that is
relentlessly battered by the elements, limited satellite coverage, and
unique electromagnetic effects that degrade communications also
contribute to challenges. Climate change is also degrading coastal
infrastructure and contributing to less predictable conditions.

U.S. military services can also make themselves more effective by more
extensively emulating the tactics, training, and equipment choices of
allies that specialize more in Arctic operations than the U.S. does.
These include Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and even
non-Arctic Britain and the Netherlands. Expanding already substantial
training, exercises, and operations alongside these nations can improve
both U.S. capabilities and interoperability.

Our report on the U.S. military's ability to protect U.S. national
interests and people in the Arctic primarily focused on the Coast
Guard's operations there, but also considered those of other services.
It recommends investing in additional Arctic-capable platforms and
infrastructure. Beyond vitally needed icebreakers, other investments
include a deepwater port in Nome, more ground transportation
infrastructure, more communications infrastructure, and systems that
contribute to **[[multidomain]{.mark} awareness]{.underline}**. Given
the destructive power of the Arctic environment, these investments
**[[will require more intensive and frequent
maintenance]{.underline}]{.mark}** than is required for comparable
systems at lower latitudes.

### !---Arctic War---AT: Deterrence Checks---2AC

#### Deterrence won't prevent conflict in the Arctic -- multipolarity and declining cooperation break the assumptions of classical deterrence theory 

Rebecca **Rempe**, 5/9/**23**, Security Distillery, "The Meltdown:
Nuclear Relations in the Arctic,"
https://thesecuritydistillery.org/all-articles/the-meltdown-nuclear-relations-in-the-arctic,

**[Arctic security can be characterised as a nexus between multipolar
nuclear conflict and climate change]{.underline}**. Multipolarity is
defined as a global balance of power between multiple actors \[3\].
**[[Climate Change]{.underline}]{.mark}** is making seaways and
resources more accessible, which **[[is leading to a thawing of
territorial conflicts which were formerly frozen]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\[4\]. **[[China's increasing]{.mark} economic
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Arctic **[mean[s it must be
considered as a regional actor]{.mark}]{.underline}** despite its
near-regional status \[5\]. [**[Russia]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}**]{.mark} recently **[[threatened to use nuclear
weapons]{.mark} against the United States]{.underline}** (U.S.) **[due
to]{.underline}** its objections to Russia's invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**; [**[this]{.underline}** **[sets a precedent
for heightened nuclear tension in the Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[which is the most nuclearized area in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and has seen a steady buildup of nuclear
and conventional forces by regional actors]{.underline}** \[6\]. These
factors have led to direct tensions between three major nuclear actors
(namely, NATO, China, and Russia) in a region that is becoming
increasingly competitive \[7\]. **[These [tensions cannot be adequately
explained by existing deterrence models]{.mark}, which rely on Cold
War-era bipolar game theory]{.underline}** \[8\]. **[Due to climate
change, geopolitical tension, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[nuclear relations in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[are unstable
and present serious security risks]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that cannot
be contended with through the use of classic deterrence
theory]{.underline}** \[9\]. The Arctic region is 66.5° north of the
equator and encompasses the United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden,
Denmark, Norway, Russia, and Iceland, all of whom are members of the
region's governing body, the Arctic Council \[10\]. The region's
international legal status currently lies under the United Nations
Convention for the Law of the Sea, however, due to climate change, polar
ice is melting, making the region more accessible by sea and opening up
its vast oil and gas deposits for extraction by regional actors \[11\].
**[Sino-Russian cooperation]{.underline}** along sea routes **[has given
China significant influence in the region,]{.underline}** which it wants
to develop into a "Polar Silk Road" as outlined in its 2018 Arctic White
Paper \[12\]. Chinese development interests do not align with Russia's
geopolitical goals in the Arctic, and China's ownership over Arctic
infrastructure represents an economic threat to Russian interests
\[13\]. There is growing competition between these regional actors which
is exacerbated by overlapping territorial boundary claims by Denmark,
Canada, and Russia. In addition, the Arctic Council has suspended
cooperation due to its chairmanship by Russia until the end of 2023
\[14\]. **[Classic]{.underline}** nuclear **[deterrence]{.underline}**
is steeped in Cold War bipolarity and **[relies on two rational actors
basing their decisions on what they believe their opponents\' actions
will be \[]{.underline}**15\]. Classic deterrence is expressed through
the Chicken Game \[16\]. As seen in the figure below, a player's options
are to defect and pursue a foreign policy objective or to cooperate and
maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for an actor is to
defect against a cooperating partner; however, this runs the risk of
![](media/image1.png){width="3.1964490376202974in"
height="2.2685192475940505in"}both players defecting, leading to nuclear
annihilation \[18\]. **[This [classic]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[game [does not contend with the
possibility of conflict between multiple nuclear
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[which is a key feature of Arctic
security]{.underline}**]{.mark} \[19\]. Though a three-player chicken
game has been applied to theoretical problems, such as two out of three
players needing to complete a task that all would rather not complete,
this model has yet to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\]. China,
NATO, the U.S., and Russia's **[nuclear doctrines are informed by
deterrence theory, which is problematic due to the theory's assumption
of a bipolar world order]{.underline}** \[21\]. **[[Nuclear
multipolarity in the Arctic is unstable because it no longer falls
within the traditional game theory matrix]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[and
there is an increased risk of nuclear action due to a larger number of
nuclear actors and significant regional tension]{.underline}** \[22\].
**[[Preemptive nuclear strikes are more prevalent in multipolar nuclear
politics]{.mark} due to a greater perception of threat from other actors
\[]{.underline}**23\]. Though China promotes itself as a No First Use
(NFU) state, meaning that it will not strike unless struck upon in a
nuclear capacity, Russia has threatened to strike first, and America's
position on NFU is vague \[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent
organisation in the Arctic region, only Sweden is not yet a full NATO
member and Finland has just recently gained NATO membership \[25\].
**[In multipolar deterrence, regional conflicts are more likely to
escalate into total nuclear warfare,]{.underline}** and de-escalation
relies on political bargaining as opposed to rationality modelling.
Thus, it is unclear how political bargaining will take place in an
increasingly polarised Arctic \[26\]. Though the U.S., China, and Russia
have all acceded to or ratified the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), both Russia and the U.S. have backed out of
data-sharing obligations under the New START treaty \[27\]. This
breakdown in communication between Arctic actors due to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's recent threat to use nuclear weapons
against the U.S. indicates **[that future regional disputes over Arctic
resources, navigation, and territory may give rise to nuclear
crises]{.underline}** \[28\]. Climate change in the Arctic has rendered
the region more accessible to its actors; this has inflamed tensions
between the NATO bloc and Russia over territorial disputes and Russia's
war in Ukraine and between China and Russia due to diverging economic
development goals \[29\]. As temperatures warm, **[[the region may
become a nuclear flashpoint that cannot be analysed using classic
deterrent models]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[30\].

Conflicts" *Trends*

wtk

**[[The Arctic is rapidly emerging]{.mark} as one of the most
geopolitically significant regions]{.underline}** in the 21st century.
Climate Change and the melting of the ice floes in the Arctic Ocean have
presented new opportunities, which has generated the issue of managing
the polar region among the major international powers. The Arctic is
once again becoming a major strategic problem due to two factors. The
first is global **[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}** which
**[[accelerates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the prospects for
**[[exploitation of]{.underline}]{.mark}** natural
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** and of transit through sea lanes
that shorten distances and push the riparian states to assert their
interests and sovereignty over these spaces. The second is **[the
[global strategic competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[between
the]{.underline}** United States (**[U.S.]{.underline}**) and its
allies, **[Russia and China]{.underline}**: it antagonizes relationships
and **[[exacerbates disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}** hitherto managed
through cooperation. [**[The Arctic has been]{.underline}** **[barreling
toward conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark} for a long time. **[[As one of
the only physical meeting points between three great
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the U.S., Russia, and China) it could be
argued that it was inevitable to become a geopolitical conflict zone,
especially considering the long-standing conflicts between these three
countries.

## Competition Advantage

### S---US Key

#### US leadership and allied cooperation are key

**Pechko 25**, M.A. graduate from Seton Hall University's School of
Diplomacy & International Relations specializing in International
Security and Europe. (Kiel, 1-7-2025, "Rising Tensions and Shifting
Strategies: The Evolving Dynamics of US Grand Strategy in the Arctic"
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/rising-tensions-shifting-strategies-evolving-dynamics-us-grand-strategy-arctic/)
wtk

**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** development and **[[policies have
transitioned from cooperative to competitive due to Russian]{.mark}
development, [militarization]{.mark}, and the PRC's expanding influence,
[necessitating a recalibrated US grand strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The 2022 US National Strategy for the Arctic Region presented a
comprehensive response, prioritizing security, climate resilience,
sustainable development, and international governance. Its multi-pronged
approach, emphasizing the immediate need for a unified NATO Arctic
strategy, furthers US interests and aligns military, economic, and
environmental policies among Arctic NATO members.

**[When engaging Russia, [the US must present a strong deterrent]{.mark}
while pursuing selective diplomatic efforts on shared concerns such
as]{.underline}** environmental protection and **[accident
prevention]{.underline}**. This balanced strategy, valuing both strength
and diplomacy, is necessary to reduce the risk of miscalculations. At
the same time, **[[strengthening the US role]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
multilateral forums like the Arctic Council [**[is]{.underline}**
**[essential to counter PRC's influence]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
prevent it from gaining leverage as a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic"
stakeholder.

Climate change will create shipping opportunities and natural resource
access, accompanied by the potential for economic growth and strategic
challenges. In navigating this evolving landscape, the US strives to
balance energy, security, and environmental protection but conflicting
interests complicate policy coherence. Political changes and stakeholder
sentiment can significantly shape strategy, often resulting in abrupt
shifts. Maintaining consistency is crucial, especially as environmental
issues increasingly intersect with energy independence and national
security.

Security remains central to US strategy, but vulnerabilities exist due
to military and infrastructure gaps. [**[Russia's aggressive Arctic
buildup contrasts with the US's limited fleet and
infrastructure]{.underline}**. **[The US]{.underline}** **[relies on
strengthening alliances]{.underline}**]{.mark}, mainly through NATO,
which Sweden now reinforces and Finland's membership. **[Balancing
defense, diplomacy, and coalition-building is vital to safeguarding US
interests and Arctic stability.]{.underline}** **[The [US can shape the
Arctic's future through]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[strategic investments
and leadership]{.underline}**]{.mark}, ensuring alignment between
national security, environmental, and economic goals.

### S---Drones Key

#### Drones Key

wtk

Monitoring increased commercial and illegal activity

**[With climate change's dramatic effects on the Arctic,
and]{.underline}** the resulting **[increased maritime
traffic]{.underline}** and geopolitical competition for commercial
control, NATO will need continuous airborne situational awareness and
communications within the Alliance and with Arctic partners. **[[New
Arctic]{.mark}-ready [UAS are ideal assets for]{.mark} conducting such
civil [operations]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}**. **[[With the
ability to withstand extremely low temperatures]{.mark} and the ability
to fly long missions via satellite]{.underline}**,
**[[Arctic]{.mark}-ready [UAS are well suited for continuously
monitoring shipping lane]{.mark}s, fisheries, and environmental
disasters, and for conducting search and rescue operations. [More UAS
over the Arctic could enhance cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, help
ensure the safety of peaceful commercial activity, and improve climate
security.

For example, if a ship is in distress and a UAS is on mission, the
**[aircraft can easily be tasked to provide video, radar, and
communications]{.underline}** relay in support of first responders; the
**[UAS could potentially deploy life-saving emergency supplies
directly]{.underline}**. Similarly, if there are reports of illicit
fishing operations and a suspected vessel turns off its transponder
identification, UAS can help authorities to locate, identify, and
apprehend the vessel, removing the guesswork and initial risks to human
patrols.

**[[Arctic-ready UAS can also be valuable research tools for
monitoring]{.mark} wildlife, [icemelt]{.mark}, and more to help
scientists understand the environmental and community impacts of climate
change]{.underline}**, despite complications brought on by Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. Before, Russia and the Arctic 7 were largely able
to collaborate on important environmental research and socio-economic
development activities in the region through the Arctic Council. But due
to Russia's invasion, the Arctic 7 countries have largely isolated
Moscow from ongoing activities at a cost of resources and regional
access. **[The use of UAS could help fill gaps by supporting important
airborne research on the impacts of climate change on Arctic ecosystems
and communities.]{.underline}**

### S---AT: Need Icebreakers

#### Icebreakers now

wtk

As climate change accelerates the melting of Arctic ice, **[[previously
inaccessible shipping lanes are becoming viable trade
routes]{.underline}]{.mark}** - cutting transit times and reshaping
global logistics. In this context, **[[South Korea and Japan's]{.mark}
advanced [icebreaker]{.mark} shipbuilding [capabilities are
emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}** as potential leverage in ongoing tariff
discussions with the United States, which is seeking allies to counter
growing Chinese and Russian influence in the region, Korea JoongAng
Daily reported.

Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru **[[Ishiba]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has
**[[signalled interest in positioning icebreaker cooperation as a key
point in negotiations with]{.underline}]{.mark}** President Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, scheduled for final talks during the
G7 summit in Canada this June.

**[[Demand for icebreakers]{.mark} is set to [rise due to the push to
open Arctic passages]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A Korean industry report
notes the US aims to procure ten such vessels by 2037.
**[[Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with its commercial icebreaker
expertise, **[[holds a competitive edge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unlike
Japan, which focuses on research-focused ships, Korea has built several
Arc-7 class vessels, capable of cutting through 2.1-metre-thick ice in
either direction.

Samsung Heavy Industries pioneered two-way icebreaking tankers in 2005
and continues to collaborate with Russia on Arctic LNG carriers. Hanwha
Ocean also remains active in constructing high-capacity vessels for
global clients.

Arctic shipping offers reduced travel times---up to 30% shorter than
conventional routes. With climate change enabling year-round navigation
by 2030, Korea is well-placed to propose joint ventures, strengthening
its hand in trade and geopolitical influence.

The shift from climate risk to Arctic opportunity is reshaping trade
alliances. **[For Korea and Japan, tech advantage may soon translate
into real negotiating power]{.underline}**. That said, it's worth
recognising that the very conditions creating these new trade routes
also reflect broader environmental changes. Any long-term gains must be
weighed against the accelerating pace of climate change and its
irreversible consequences.

Trump]{.underline}** **[admin]{.underline}**]{.mark}istration
**[[began]{.mark} working toward]{.underline}** **[[strengthening US
relations with South Korea and Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** as early as
2017. During a trip to the region, which included stops in Seoul and
Tokyo, President Trump said he "had the honor of sharing our vision for
a free and open Indo-Pacific --- a place where sovereign and independent
nations...can all prosper side-by-side, and thrive in freedom and in
peace." His 2017 National Security Strategy emphasized the Indo-Pacific
region, committing to "encourage the development of a strong defense
network with our allies and partners" such as South Korea and Japan. In
2019, the Trump administration released its Free and Open Indo-Pacific
strategy, adopting and advancing a regional concept that had been
promoted by Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo for much of the 2010s.
Other states, including Korea and Japan, have released their own
versions of an Indo-Pacific strategy. While President-elect Trump is
known to quickly change his mind, these developments suggest it is
unlikely he will reverse course on the Indo-Pacific, where South Korea
and Japan are critical partners.

Although Trump has not yet been sworn into office, **[the contours of
his]{.underline}** national security and foreign policy **[team suggest
[his admin]{.mark}istration [will support
trilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Senator Marco
**[[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark}** (R-FL) is expected to serve as the
secretary of state and **[has [strongly supported trilateral
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When President Yoon and then Prime
Minister Kishida Fumio visited Camp David in August 2023, the senator
wrote on social media that a "trilateral alliance between the US, Japan,
and Korea would be a crucial foundation that furthers our joint efforts
in the Indo-Pacific." Representative Mike Waltz (R-FL), who has been
tapped as national security advisor, also seems to view the Indo-Pacific
in a manner that supports trilateralism. Waltz, like Rubio, is one of
the co-authors of an April 2024 congressional report on the need for a
national maritime strategy. The document identifies China as a
significant threat in this domain and calls for "mutually beneficial
relationships with treaty allies, exploring comparative advantages to
lower cost, time, and the complexity of rebuilding America's domestic
shipping and shipbuilding industry."

Elbridge Colby, a member of the first Trump administration who has been
tapped to be undersecretary of defense for policy, shares such concerns
about China. Colby has been outspoken in identifying the Taiwan Strait
and Korean Peninsula as potential conflict areas. He has stressed the
need for South Korea to take on the overwhelming responsibility for its
own defense (potentially including its own nuclear deterrent) and the
interconnectivity between South Korean and Japanese security and
promoted a rethinking of the US force posture on the Korean Peninsula
and the broader Indo-Pacific region to more flexibly address
simultaneous conflicts and threats from China. For his part, Pete
Hegseth, former Fox and Friends Weekend host and Trump's nominee for
secretary of defense, has said little about the Indo-Pacific. However,
his past news commentary on Fox News suggests he would be a vociferous
supporter of Trump's national security decisions, whatever they might
be. Taken together, these prospective **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration **[[officials suggest there will be voices supporting
trilateral cooperation in dealing with security challenges in the

### !---Democracy---AT: DPT False

#### Democratic Peace Theory has robust empirical support -- democracies are significantly more peaceful than autocracies

Michael **Doyle**, 6/18/**24**, \[Professor of International Affairs,
Law, and Political Science at Columbia University and the author of Cold
Peace: Avoiding the New Cold War\], Foreign Affairs, "Why They Don't
Fight," https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/why-they-dont-fight-doyle,
mm

**[[Few hypotheses in i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [are more
influential than d]{.mark}emocratic [p]{.mark}eace
[t]{.mark}heory]{.underline}**---the idea that democracies do not go to
war with one another. **[[The idea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the political
scientist Jack Levy wrote, "**[[comes as close as anything we have to an
empirical law]{.mark} in international relations]{.underline}**." It has
motivated U.S. foreign policy for nearly a century. In the early 1900s,
U.S. President Woodrow Wilson embraced democracy promotion as a means to
peace. During the Cold War, successive administrations spoke of the
standoff with the Soviet bloc using grand ideological terminology. No
distillation was grander than President Ronald Reagan's address before
the British Parliament in 1982, in which he claimed that the West
exercised "consistent restraint and peaceful intentions" and then
proceeded (seemingly without irony) to call for a "campaign for
democracy" and a "crusade for freedom" around the world. Democratic
peace theory became especially influential once the Cold War ended,
leaving the United States truly ascendant. In his 1994 State of the
Union address, President Bill Clinton claimed that "the best strategy to
ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the
advance of democracy elsewhere." His administration then surged aid to
nascent post-Soviet democracies. Clinton's successor, George W. Bush,
was equally vocal about the need to advance liberalism in order to
promote peace, telling the 2004 Republican National Convention, "As
freedom advances, heart by heart, and nation by nation, America will be
more secure and the world more peaceful." As president, Bush even used
democratic peace theory as one of the justifications for invading Iraq.
In a speech on the war in November 2003, he declared, "The advance of
freedom leads to peace." The idea that democracy breeds peace, however,
is at best half true. The United States has repeatedly attacked other
countries. Europe's major democracies also have a long history of
intervening in other regions, such as the Sahel. And rather than marking
the permanent triumph of liberal democracy, the post--Cold War period is
now defined by growing divisions and conflict. As is now plain, the
spread of liberalism does not by itself curtail fighting. Yet the
proliferation of **[[wars carried out by democracies does not
disprove]{.mark} democratic peace theory wholesale]{.underline}**.
[**[Liberal state]{.underline}**s]{.mark} may not act peaceably toward
everyone, but they **[[act peaceably toward one
another]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are no clear-cut cases of one
democracy going to war against another, nor do any seem forthcoming. In
fact, the global divisions emerging today confirm democratic peace
theory: once again, the line runs between liberal states and
authoritarian ones, with the United States and its mostly democratic
allies on one side and autocracies, most notably China and Russia, on
the other. The world, then, could be peaceful if all states became
liberal democracies. But until that happens, the world will likely
remain mired in a dangerous ideological standoff. **[Democratic peace
theory has a long history]{.underline}**. In 1776, the American
revolutionary Thomas Paine argued that liberal states do not fight one
another, writing that "the Republics of Europe are all (and we may say
always) in peace." When Paine's country gained independence and then
drafted its constitution, the document implicitly referred to the idea
that democracies should be conflict-averse. It placed the authority to
declare war in the legislature---the branch with members directly
elected by the public---in part to prevent the country from entering
unpopular conflicts. Democratic peace theory had early proponents across
the Atlantic, as well. Its most influential initial champion was the
German philosopher Immanuel Kant. In 1795, Kant published Perpetual
Peace, an essay that took the form of a hypothetical peace treaty and
that established the concept's theoretical foundations. Representative
republics, Kant explained, did not fight one another for a mix of
institutional, ideological, and economic reasons. Kant's writings called
for states to adopt a representative republican form of government with
an elected legislative body and a separation of powers among the
executive, judiciary, and legislative branches---all guaranteed by
constitutional law. Kant's republic was far from a modern democracy;
only male property holders could vote and become what he called "active
citizens." Nonetheless, he argued that elected representation would
inspire caution and that the separation of powers would produce careful
deliberation. Although these forces would not guarantee peace, he
admitted, they would select for rational and popular conflicts. If "the
consent of the citizens is required to decide whether or not war is to
be declared," Kant wrote, "it is very natural that they will have great
hesitation in embarking on so dangerous an enterprise." For doing so, he
continued, would mean calling down on themselves all the miseries of
war, such as doing the fighting themselves, supplying the costs of the
war from their own resources, painfully making good the ensuing
devastation, and, as the crowning evil, having to take upon themselves a
burden of debt which will embitter peace itself and which can never be
paid off on account of the constant threat of new wars. But under a
constitution in which the subject is not a citizen, and which is
therefore not republican, it is the simplest thing in the world to go to
war. For the head of state is not a fellow citizen, but the owner of the
state, and a war will not force him to make the slightest sacrifice so
far as his banquets, hunts, pleasure palaces and court festivals are
concerned. He can thus decide on war, without any significant reason, as
a kind of amusement, and unconcernedly leave it to the diplomatic corps
(who are always ready for such purposes) to justify the war for the sake
of propriety. Kant also called for republics to make commitments to
peace and universal hospitality. The former idea entailed a commitment
to peaceful relations and collective self-defense, rather like NATO's.
The latter meant treating all international visitors without hostility,
offering asylum to people whose lives were at risk, and allowing
visitors to share their ideas and propose commercial exchanges. This
combination, Kant said, would build security, create mutual respect, and
generate economic ties that lead to tranquility. And thus, republic by
emerging republic, the combination would create peace. Kant did not
argue that his ideas would stop tension and conflict between republics
and autocracies. In fact, he argued that representative republics might
become suspicious of states not ruled by their citizens. But he did
believe that liberal values such as human rights and respect for
property would curb a country's desire for glory, fear of conquest, and
need to plunder---three forces that drive states to war. He therefore
thought that liberal republics would be respectful and restrained when
addressing one another, even as they remained suspicious and fearful of
nonrepublics. Views similar to Kant's on liberty, republics, commerce,
and peace spread throughout nineteenth-century Europe and beyond. French
Foreign Minister Francois Guizot, a conservative liberal who served from
1840 to 1848, spoke enthusiastically about mutual freedom as a
foundation for an entente with the United Kingdom. British Prime
Minister William Gladstone, who led his country for much of the latter
half of the 1800s, was a proponent. And when U.S. President Abraham
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it helped tilt
liberal opinion in Europe toward the Union and away from the
Confederacy. It was not, however, until World War I that the full
democratic peace proposition became central to foreign policy. Wilson's
war message in April 1917---in which he declared that the battle between
autocracies and democracies would establish "the principles of peace and
justice"---was the clarion call. The clash between democracy and
autocracy continued to shape policy as the decades went on. The behavior
of the United States during the Cold War, for example, was often
motivated by a belief that spreading liberal values would yield peace.
As Secretary of State John Foster Dulles declared in his 1953 Senate
confirmation hearing, "We shall never have a secure peace or a happy
world so long as Soviet communism dominates one-third of all the peoples
that there are." President John F. Kennedy echoed that theme in his 1963
speech in West Berlin, declaring that "when all are free, then we can
look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this
country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful
globe." But that same month, in a powerful address at American
University, Kennedy warned of the complementary dangers of ideological
confrontation with the Soviet Union. "Let us not be blind to our
differences---but let us also direct attention to our common interests
and the means by which those differences can be resolved," he said. "If
we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world
safe for diversity." **[As liberalism endured and spread, intellectuals
began empirically testing whether democratic peace theory actually held
true.]{.underline}** In 1939, the American journalist Clarence Streit
published a qualitative historical analysis to see whether liberal
democracies tended to maintain peace among themselves. Discerning that
the answer was yes, he proposed that the decade's leading democracies
form a federal union, which would help protect them from fascist powers.
In 1972, Dean Babst, building on Quincy Wright's magisterial A Study of
War from 30 years earlier, carried out a statistical analysis that also
suggested a correlation between democracy and peace. In 1976, Melvin
Small and J. David Singer confirmed this finding but demonstrated that
democratic peace was limited to relations between democracies.
Republics, they showed, were still prone to fight autocratic regimes. In
the decades since, **[[i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations
[scholars]{.mark} have continued to study the democratic peace
paradigm]{.underline}**. **[They [have shown that the relationship
between democracy and peace is statistically significant even when
controlling for proximity, wealth, and trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
They have determined that the theory holds even when states attempt to
constrain each other. Academics have advanced a wide variety of
explanations for why the concept is so sturdy. Some have argued that
part of the reason lies in the disproportionate influence that
international institutions have with liberal countries. **[Research
shows that democracies tend to delegate]{.underline}** a lot of
**[policymaking to complex multilateral bodies]{.underline}**, such as
the European Union and the World Trade Organization, in part because
their leaders can use these groups to entrench policies before cycling
out of office. Other scholars have argued that **[[liberal norms
favoring peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, human rights, and respect for
fellow democracies **[[hold sway over policymakers and
publics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And still **[others have pointed to the
benefits of trade]{.underline}** and economic interdependence associated
with relations **[among capitalist democracies]{.underline}**. States
that frequently trade, after all, will lose wealth if they fight one
another.

face-to-face]{.underline}** bilateral **[discussions]{.underline}** and
interact with officials and experts from other states. **[[While]{.mark}
these [engagements have value in theory, they highlight three persistent
problems]{.mark} in the practice of U.S.-China relations]{.underline}**.
First, **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark} tend to
[talk past each other]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, **[the United
States and China [have dissimilar systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which
makes identifying and engaging with appropriate counterpart officials
very difficult. Third, **[the United States [and]{.mark} China
[possess]{.mark} [fundamentally different understandings about the role
of third countries]{.mark} in managing confrontation and mitigating
conflict]{.underline}**.

The Dismal Art of Talking Past Each Other

While U.S.-China dialogues on security matters are almost always better
than the alternative, discussions as performative art can have little if
any value. At best, they can permit the two sides to clarify each
other's policies and stances. The problem is that **[[dialogues]{.mark}
can [produce holding patterns]{.mark} while [giving]{.mark} [the
illusion of progress]{.mark} or fuel false expectations. [More worrisome
is the potential for exacerbating existing]{.mark} mutual
[suspicions]{.mark} and distrust [if one side concludes that the other
is negotiating in bad faith]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Given
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** current **[[abysmal state]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
U.S.-China [relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[one side [drawing
conclusions]{.mark} about what is driving these bad faith actions [could
engender an even more toxic environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

While this year's Shangri La Dialogue saw U.S. and Chinese defense
chiefs meeting in-person for the first time since 2022, Austin and
Dong's meeting held a familiar pattern of high-level officials talking
past each other. Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun in a
speech warned that "anyone who dares to separate Taiwan from China will
only end up in self-destruction" and blamed an array of actors for
fomenting instability and elevating the threat of conflict in the Taiwan
Strait and elsewhere in China's extended neighborhood. China itself
remains a blameless victim --- at least in its own telling. Dong
reiterated long-standing Beijing talking points about China "never
provoking incidents or easily resorting to the use of force" to resolve
its "border and maritime disputes."

U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin meanwhile did not stray far from
the usual U.S. talking points about "respect for sovereignty and
international law" as well as "freedom of the seas and skies." Austin
spoke of "openness, transparency, and accountability." He reiterated
U.S. preferences for "the peaceful resolution of disputes through
dialogue" over resolution via "coercion or conflict."

The Perennial Problem of Appropriate Counterpart National Security
Officials

**[[Austin and Dong were the highest-level]{.mark} U.S. and Chinese
[officials]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Singapore. **[On the surface
[these]{.mark} two [leaders appear to be appropriate
counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline}**: each hold a similar title that
suggests that he is the most senior official from their respective
military establishments. Yet **[[nothing could be further from the
truth.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[While in the United States, the secretary of defense is the most
senior civilian official]{.underline}** in the Pentagon, **[in
[China]{.mark} the [minister of defense is]{.mark} a largely
[ceremonial]{.mark} position]{.underline}** always occupied by uniformed
general officer --- Dong is an admiral in the People's Liberation Army's
(PLA) Navy. China's minister of defense might best be characterized as
the PLA's "chief foreign liaison officer." The incumbent typically
derives his power and authority from concurrently occupying a seat on
the Central Military Commission. However, Dong is an unusual defense
minister in that he is not a member of the CMC. He was selected in a
somewhat haphazard fashion in late 2023 to fill the vacancy created by
the mid-2023 purge of the last minister (who did occupy a seat on the
CMC).

**[[The dialogue]{.mark} between]{.underline}** Secretary **[Austin
and]{.underline}** Minister **[Dong [was a serious
mismatch]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The two are clearly nowhere close to
being counterpart defense officials.]{.underline}** While the former is
President Joe Biden's most senior military advisor located at the apex
of the Pentagon chain-of-command, the latter is not even comparable to a
U.S. service chief. His exclusion from the CMC signals that Dong is
certainly not roughly equivalent to a member of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff (the former organ has been compared to the latter). Dong almost
certainly does not have the ear or confidence of China's
commander-in-chief and chair of the CMC, Xi Jinping, in the same way
that Austin has close and routine contact to Biden.

Decision-Making."
https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/dont-be-so-confident-nuclear-decision-making.

The **[[psychology and emotions of decision-makers matter in a
crisis]{.mark} because they introduce an element of individual
difference that may not be easily captured by looking at
averages]{.underline}**. **[Some leaders see risk where others see
opportunity, and some are more willing to risk catastrophic
consequences]{.underline}**. Moreover, individuals differ enormously in
their ability to accurately recognize emotions in others and, thus,
accurately interpret who might fight and who might back down. They also
vary even more in their ability to manage and regulate their own
emotions in the context of loss, threat, or frustration. Leaders such as
Putin may be rare, but those who emerge prove enormously consequential.
Particularly **[[when the authority to launch nuclear weapons rests in
the hands of a single leader]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[[as in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**) **[[or a very small group
of leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[[as in
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**), **[individual [differences in
impulsivity, narcissism, or risk-taking can exert a decisive
difference]{.mark} in responses to threat]{.underline}**. **[[Both sides
in a crisis]{.mark} may fail to understand the true meanings of the
signals they receive]{.underline}** and **[not comprehend the ways that
the signals they send may be [misperceived]{.mark} by [the other]{.mark}
side]{.underline}**. **[[Uncertainty can compound]{.mark} as each side
interprets the same information in different ways]{.underline}**.
**[Fear and anger can induce leaders to take risks they might not have
if they had more time to consider their options]{.underline}**, were
**[not acting under the pressures of crisis or threat]{.underline}**, or
did not have to be concerned about domestic and international reactions.
Incorporating a more psychological perspective into analyses of nuclear
brinkmanship suggests that **[revisions to existing policies and
approaches to nuclear risk reduction may be in order]{.underline}**. For
instance, traditional arms control treaties and other risk reduction
mechanisms are undoubtedly valuable when they make material changes to
nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles that can reinforce deterrence or
reduce the tyranny of haste in a nuclear crisis. But disrupting
irrational processes requires more than just buying time---it matters
what decision-makers do with that time. The most valuable use of that
time would involve checking their emotions and biases. **[This [can be
improved]{.mark}]{.underline}**, most simply, **[[by requiring more than
one person to agree before authorizing the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Dedicated procedures and protocols for
decision-making based on those successfully implemented in other fields,
such as medicine, could also be developed and implemented to help reduce
common biases. Launch officers must follow checklists, but political
leaders do not. We suggest that should change. The past few years should
make clear to all observers the outsized role of individuals in the
conduct of foreign policy. We all share common intuitions about the
circumstances that tend to make even our friends react with fury, if not
violence: when they are frustrated, when they are backed into a corner
and do not see any way out, when they are tired or hungry or scared,
when they are lonely and feeling isolated. Similarly **[[imperfect human
decision-making remains a crucial part of nuclear
brinkmanship]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet, **[if we know what
circumstances are most likely to generate alarm, we can begin to work
toward ways to increase the likelihood that the choices leaders make in
such situations create less chance and more control]{.underline}**.

### Dialogue Fails---China---1AR

#### China distrusts hotlines\-\--they won't pick up.

College (\*Lyle Morris, \*\*Kyle Marcrum, July 27, 2022, "ANOTHER
"HOTLINE" WITH CHINA ISN'T THE ANSWER," Pacific Forum,
https://pacforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PacNet41.2022.07.27-1.pdf)

However, **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and PRC hold different
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** and goals **[[about
hotlines]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The United States views them as a tool to deconflict and de-escalate and
communicate between forces during a crisis. **[The [PLA harbors]{.mark}
deep [suspicion about]{.mark} crisis [communications with]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, and [perceives US proposals]{.mark} for
new channels [as]{.mark} an [excuse to engage in provocative]{.mark}
military [activities]{.mark} near PRC claimed waters and
territory.]{.underline}**

Beijing regards crisis communications as subservient to broader
political goals of "crisis management," which encompass exploiting
crises to its advantage and manipulating risk calculations. Hotlines are
not meant to resolve the crisis but to empower higher level organs
within the PRC to signal resolve, assign blame, and stall until Beijing
stakes out a position of maximum pressure and leverage over the United
States during negotiations.

This incompatibility has not stopped senior US defense officials from
holding out hope that hotlines and personal relationships with PLA
leaders might ease tensions. In his recent book, for instance, former US
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper says he could rapidly contact his
"counterpart," Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe, to clear
up misunderstandings.

Such **[[hopes could be misplaced]{.mark}. Not only could hotlines fail
to solve crises, but they might also not perform as
intended]{.underline}**. As Kurt Campbell, the Biden administration's
National Security council Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, has said:
**[[hotlines]{.mark} tend to "[ring endlessly in empty
rooms]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[Dialogues can proceed for many years without tangible outcomes or

unimportant but one should not equate one or both sides blowing off
steam with the building of meaningful trust or the formulation and
implementation of concrete policy solutions.

Hotlines exist between the United States and China at the executive and
military levels. Grounded in their experiences in the twentieth century,
various U.S. administrations have long viewed hotlines as a vital
diplomatic asset and have been motivated to use them during contemporary
crises, either with China or other strategic competitors. Although
**[the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty leadership
[has]{.mark} so far [shown]{.mark} an [aversion to managing
escalation]{.mark} bilaterally with the United States,
frequently [leaving calls unanswered]{.mark} over the past few decades.
[Beijing ignored]{.mark} American [attempts]{.mark} to communicate
[during]{.mark} the [Tiananmen]{.mark} Square massacre in 1989. [Twelve
calls]{.mark} were made [by]{.mark} the [Bush]{.mark} administration
[during]{.mark} the [Hainan]{.mark} Island incident in 2001, with
[each]{.mark} of them similarly [being snubbed]{.mark}. The [same would
happen]{.mark} again [during]{.mark} numerous other episodes, and
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping and other Chinese policymakers [have
rebuffed]{.mark} modest [proposals for]{.mark} more active
[hotline]{.mark} discussions.]{.underline}**

Analysts have noted that **[[Chinese]{.mark} officials [hold
suspicions]{.mark} over [why America]{.mark}n leaders [would
want]{.mark} to utilize [hotlines, viewing them as]{.mark} little other
than an [instrument]{.mark} for the United States [to]{.mark}
surreptitiously [normalize]{.mark} certain Indo-[Pacific]{.mark} region
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More dangerously, they also believe
they can find strategic advantage in avoiding hotline conversations
and the ambiguity this helps create. But regardless of the differences
of opinion, the Cold War shows bilateral crisis management is still
essential.

As **[anxiety continues to mount over the fate of Taiwan and the South

the Communist Party leadership to come to the phone more promptly.
Complaining after the fact isn't enough. It should now be a significant
part of U.S. foreign policy to construct a more effective hotline
dialogue with Beijing. American officials must explain that the
ambiguity the Chinese leaders seek during a crisis is dangerous.

**[With the rise of artificial intelligence and the ubiquity of
disinformation, serious miscalculations over specific naval movements or
espionage incidents have become more likely]{.underline}**. A lack of
communication could result in a dangerous slide toward military or
nuclear confrontation. In a geopolitical climate where atomic
threats have again begun to be bandied around, Beijing and Washington
will find that talking is the best medicine.

Starting an "Arms Race"

Perhaps **[the most common [response to]{.mark}]{.underline}** proposals
to improve and expand US **[homeland [missile defenses
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** that such action **[[would]{.mark} inevitably
[prompt]{.mark} an adversary reaction]{.underline}** in the form of
producing greater numbers of offensive missiles **[to overwhelm the
defensive system]{.underline}**. According to this line of thought, at
best the action-reaction cycle will be a waste of resources for no net
gain in security, and, at worst, the action-reaction cycle will continue
unchecked and deepen the sense of security loss, **[leading to [an arms
race]{.mark}]{.underline}**, worsened political relations,
**[[and]{.mark} potentially [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[While simple to understand]{.underline}** as a concept, **[the
offense-defense, [action-reaction]{.mark} construct [lacks a]{.mark}
substantial [historical foundation]{.mark} for its
claims]{.underline}**.34 For instance, **[the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates continued to [improve]{.mark} and expand [its]{.mark}
homeland missile [defenses after withdrawing from]{.mark} the
[ABM]{.mark} Treaty [in 2002, and]{.mark} yet]{.underline}**---contrary
to the action-reaction hypothesis---**[[Russia did not]{.mark} engage in
an [arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the United States to overcome
those defenses.35 Indeed, **[[during that]{.mark} time [period, Russia
engaged]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the United States **[[in]{.mark}
agreeing to [multiple]{.mark} nuclear arms control [treaties]{.mark}
while [knowing]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[these treaties [would
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** substantially **[[limit US]{.mark} homeland
missile [defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}**.36 As Ambassador Robert Joseph
has observed, "while the conclusion of the ABM Treaty in 1972 led to the
largest Soviet strategic nuclear build-up in history...the U.S.
withdrawal from the treaty 30 years later was followed by an actual
decrease in Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal."37 **[US actions on
[missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}** simply **[[are not]{.mark} as
tightly [linked to Russian reactions]{.mark} as the arms race hypothesis
would suggest]{.underline}**.

**[[While Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** today **[[portrays]{.mark} its
new strategic [nuclear programs as a reaction]{.mark} to US missile
defense deployments, [this was not the view]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
senior Russian officials **[[a decade ago]{.mark}. In
2014]{.underline}**, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei **[[Lavrov
stated]{.mark}, "I [don't think]{.mark} we are [on the verge of]{.mark}
a new [arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At least Russia definitely
won't be a part of it. In our case, it's just that the time has come for
us to modernize our nuclear and conventional arsenals."38 Russian
President Vladimir **[[Putin]{.mark} also [stated]{.mark} in
2001]{.underline}** that the US **[[withdrawal]{.mark} from the ABM
Treaty "does [not pose a threat]{.mark} to the]{.underline}** national
**[security of the Russian Federation]{.underline}**."39
**[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other **[statements
[indicate]{.mark} Russian [officials play up]{.mark} purported
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** to their nuclear forces from US homeland
missile defenses **[when it suits their needs]{.underline}**, but often
dismiss such threats and the risk of an arms race.40

Critics may respond that Russia may not fit the action-reaction
hypothesis, but China's vast nuclear expansion beginning around 2021
appears to conform to the predicted reaction. Yet, even in this case,
**[it is far from clear]{.underline}** that **[the primary driver of
China's nuclear expansion is]{.underline}** an (unrealized) expansion in
US **[homeland missile defenses]{.underline}**. Indeed, the Biden
administration signaled its reticence to significantly expand US
homeland missile defenses in its "2022 Missile Defense Review,"
reiterating that it sought to deter Chinese strikes on the homeland with
US nuclear forces alone. Moreover, gone is the concept of "layered"
homeland missile defense from that review and official Biden
administration talking points. Adding to the unlikelihood that US
homeland missile defenses are the primary driver of China's nuclear
missile buildup is the fact that **[[China's]{.mark} nuclear [forces
began growing]{.mark} rapidly [all at once]{.mark}--- making a break
from the slow and steady buildup of decades past]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[the [action-reaction]{.mark} hypothesis [would predict]{.mark} that,
as the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates made [incremental improvements
to]{.mark} its homeland [missile defenses, China]{.mark} would [react
in]{.mark} a [similar manner. Instead, China made a sharp break]{.mark}
from past practice, [indicating]{.mark} an [internal change]{.mark} in
policy [rather than a reaction]{.mark} to unrealized US homeland missile
defense advances.]{.underline}**

#### No crisis instability\-\--even if missile defense makes a first strike easier, [deterrence will hold]{.underline}.

Sparking International Conflict

The second **[major [counterargument to]{.mark}]{.underline}** improving
and **[expanding US homeland [missile defenses is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that **[doing so [might spark fears in China and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the United States was gaining a
significant military advantage. For China's and Russia's leaderships,
this military advantage might be so severe and enduring **[that it
would]{.underline}** become unacceptable and **[require a
correction]{.underline}** or minimization **[through military force---
be it a first strike]{.underline}** or limited strikes. **[According to
this]{.underline}** line of **[reasoning, China and/or Russia would feel
compelled to]{.underline}** either **[prevent]{.underline}** or disrupt
**[US improvements]{.underline}** or expansion **[of its homeland
missile defenses because, if they became fully operational, they could
threaten their continued existence]{.underline}**. Often **[[implicit in
this]{.mark} criticism [is the belief]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
expanded and improved **[US homeland [missile defenses]{.mark} could
[enable]{.mark} a successful [US first strike]{.mark} against Beijing or
Moscow, [or]{.mark}, at least, [it may appear that way in each]{.mark}
respective [capital]{.mark}---thus [requiring preemptive
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Here too, **[[there is little]{.mark} historical [evidence to support
this]{.mark} criticism. The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**, for instance, **[[had]{.mark} a clear
[first-strike]{.mark} capability [against]{.mark} the [Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}** for over a decade early on in the Cold War,
**[[and]{.mark} yet it [chose not to employ]{.mark} that
capability]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[[China]{.mark} itself has
[existed]{.mark}]{.underline}** for decades **[[with]{.mark} its
"[minimum deterrence]{.mark}" nuclear force [in]{.mark} the [shadow
of]{.mark} a]{.underline}** nominal **[[US first strike]{.mark}
capability, [and]{.mark} yet it [did not]{.mark} believe it had to
[take]{.mark} drastic [action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Additionally, as
the acquisition history of major US weapon systems demonstrates,
**[[any]{.mark} significant [change in]{.mark}]{.underline}** policy and
**[[capability is]{.mark} likely to be [measured in decades,
making]{.mark} the [need for sudden]{.mark} and drastic decisions (such
as preemptive [war]{.mark} with the United States) in Beijing and Moscow
seem [unfounded]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Finally, **[[the notion]{.mark} that a nation like [Russia or China
would]{.mark} opt for a nuclear [first strike]{.mark}]{.underline}**
against the United States during a crisis simply **[[because it
feared]{.mark} that [going second]{.mark} would [leave it at]{.mark} a
[disadvantage]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the nuclear balance **[strains
credulity. It [would be irrational]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in this
scenario, **[for a nuclear power [to strike a]{.mark}nother nuclear
[power that had survivable]{.mark} nuclear [forces, which is the case
for]{.mark} Russia, China, and the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. As one scholar has asked, **[why would
China intentionally start a devastating nuclear war against the United
States because it feared losing a devastating nuclear war against the
United States]{.underline}** if it waited?41 Indeed, beginning a nuclear
war for fear of eventually losing a future (potential) nuclear war would
be to commit suicide for fear of death.

### AT: Impact---Modernization---1AR

#### Modernization is wrong\-\--other factors are determinative and missile defense won't cause fast breakouts. 

**Costlow 22**, Senior Analyst, National Institute for Public Policy,
Ph.D. Candidate, George Mason (Matthew Costlow, 2022, "Vulnerability is
No Virtue and Defense is No Vice: The Strategic Benefits of Expanded
U.S. Homeland Missile Defense," NIPP, Occasional Paper, Vol. 2, No. 9,
https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OP-Vol.-2-No.-9.pdf)

Misunderstanding the Nature of Arms Competitions. **[[The
assertion]{.mark} that building improved U.S. homeland [missile
defenses]{.mark} will likely [cause an arms race]{.mark} is based on
assumptions]{.underline}**, much like the criterion on cost
effectiveness, that adversaries will react in the particular manner, and
for the reasons, that critics posit. **[But]{.underline}**, as
demonstrated above, **[[history demonstrates]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[[opponents]{.mark} have [responded]{.mark} very
[differently]{.mark}]{.underline}** from what critics have asserted as
being virtually inevitable. In fact, **[[there is
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}** either automatic or **[[predictable
about]{.mark} what [weapons]{.mark} a state develops]{.underline}**,
why, and when. This dynamic indicates that real world **[defense
[acquisition is driven by]{.mark} far [more]{.mark} factors [than simply
reacting]{.mark} to]{.underline}** what **[the United
States]{.underline}** is doing. **[[Russia, China]{.mark}, and
[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea all [have]{.mark}]{.underline}** their own
**[[domestic]{.mark}ally-driven [considerations]{.mark} (bureaucratic
[power struggles, funding]{.mark} battles, budget limits,
[tech]{.mark}nical capability), ideological considerations
(how]{.underline}** particular **[weapons represent the [state's
status]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the world stage, contribution to
**[[grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a weapon's potential
**[[propaganda]{.mark} value), [and]{.mark} operational considerations
(geographic limitations, contribution to short-term]{.underline}**
military **[goals, synchronization]{.underline}** with other defense
programs, **[[infrastructure]{.mark} delays). The fact]{.underline}**
that **[Russia and China developed ICBM-centric nuclear arsenals while
the United States developed an SLBM-centric nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}**, and the long-standing difference in overall
force size levels, **[is indication enough]{.underline}** that there is
no mechanistic relationship between U.S. defense priorities and those of
other states.

It is especially important to note in this regard that even if Russia or
China directly increase their missile arsenals in response to an
expanded and improved U.S. homeland missile defense system, that in and
of itself would not negate the value of the system. Since the system
would be designed to deter and defeat coercive attacks against the U.S.
homeland, larger Russian or Chinese arsenals per se would not
necessarily demand a further increase the capabilities of the U.S.
missile defense system in response. While larger Russian and Chinese
arsenals may place greater deterrence requirements on U.S. nuclear
forces above the level of coercive attacks on the homeland, the original
purpose of the expanded and improved U.S. homeland missile defense
system would still stand and be of value. If adversary strategic nuclear
arsenals grow in response to expanded U.S. homeland missile defenses,
far from a certainty, that would only increase the importance of raising
the threshold for nuclear war by deterrence threats of punishment and
defense-based deterrence threats of denial.

**[The notion that expanded U.S. [missile defenses]{.mark} will likely
cause an [arms race is]{.mark} further [discredited when one considers
how un-race-like]{.mark} the [U.S. defense acquisition]{.mark} process
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- with major defense program timelines from
design to deployment often **[[measured]{.mark} not in single years, but
[in decades]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An expanded and improved U.S.
**[homeland [missile defense]{.mark} system [will not happen
overnight]{.mark} and [given]{.mark} the [open nature of]{.mark} U.S.
political [debate and shifting]{.mark} political [power between
two]{.mark} major [parties, adversaries will]{.mark} likely be able to
[follow]{.mark} U.S. missile defense
[developments]{.mark}]{.underline}** in near real time as timeline and
capability projections shift. In short, **[[this]{.mark} arms dynamic is
hardly worthy of the name "race," which [should temper concerns
about]{.mark} arms race or [crisis instability]{.mark} -- there [is no
need for]{.mark} other [states to act rashly]{.mark}]{.underline}** when
the system in question may be more than a decade, or more, away from a
reality.

In conclusion, before submitting to the seemingly appealing logic of
"action-reaction" dynamics at play with U.S. missile defenses, U.S.
policymakers should consider the range of options available to
adversaries beyond "racing," the historical record that contradicts arms
racing theory, and the inherently complicated and multi-factored defense
acquisition process that plays out differently in each country according
to their unique characteristics. In short, arms racing in response to an
expanding U.S. homeland missile defense system is neither guaranteed nor
reflective of the value of the system. Additionally, critics of U.S.
homeland missile defense, as Herman Kahn pointed out over 50 years ago,
"...really cannot have it both ways. They point out, presumably
correctly, that on paper it is easy to counter and largely nullify the
\[thin missile defense\] system (subject of course, to the uncertainties
I have already discussed). They then argue that the Soviets will be so
concerned... that they will react in a serious and dramatic way,
accelerating the arms race."89 **[Whether or not Russia, China, North
Korea, or some other power will be concerned at the prospect of an
improved and expanded U.S. homeland missile defense system, the United
States cannot allow an adversary's potential concerns to have veto power
over whether it should pursue a system that, in its net effect, will
contribute greatly to its national interests around the
world.]{.underline}**

#### Russian modernization arguments are wrong.

**Soofer 21**, Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for
Strategy and Security (Robert Soofer, April 29, 2021, "MISSILE DEFENSE
IS COMPATIBLE WITH ARMS CONTROL," War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2021/04/missile-defense-is-compatible-with-arms-control/)

Why Russia Really Opposes U. S. Missile Defense

According to official statements, **[[Russia opposes]{.mark} U.S.
[missile defenses]{.mark} because they could someday provide the United
States a strategic advantage during a nuclear exchange. [While
elements]{.mark} of Russia's position [are]{.mark} no doubt
[genuine]{.mark}]{.underline}** and rooted in its confidence in
America's technological prowess, **[[there are]{.mark} likely other,
[more compelling reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}** for Russia to oppose
U.S. missile defense, ones **[having more to do [with geopolitics
than]{.mark} nuclear [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In short,
**[[Moscow]{.mark} appreciates that it [can use this]{.mark} issue [as
leverage]{.mark} with the United States]{.underline}** while creating
tension among its allies.

Obama understood this. In commenting about Russia's opposition to the
deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Europe, he observes in his
recent book that Putin "correctly understood that the main reason Poland
and the Czech Republic were eager to host our system was that it would
guarantee increased U.S. military capabilities on their soil, providing
an additional hedge against Russian intimidation." **[[Russia's
opposition to]{.mark} U.S. missile [defense in Europe]{.mark} was [not
because it feared]{.mark} that [10]{.mark} ground-based
[interceptors]{.mark} could [jeopardize]{.mark} Russia's nuclear
[retaliatory capability, but]{.mark} rather such cooperation [was an
affront to]{.mark} Russia's former [influence in]{.mark} Eastern
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Russia also viewed this as an
opportunity to sow dissension among the allies.

The **[[modernization]{.mark} and expansion]{.underline}** of Russian
nuclear forces **[has [not been driven by]{.mark} U.S. [missile
defense]{.mark} deployments. [Since]{.mark} pulling out of the
[A]{.mark}nti-[B]{.mark}allistic [M]{.mark}issile]{.underline}** Treaty,
**[the [U.S. has deployed]{.mark} a modest 44 ground-based
interceptors]{.underline}** (40 in Alaska and four in California) for
the protection of the nation against North Korean intercontinental
ballistic missiles. **[That number is projected to rise to
[64]{.mark}]{.underline}** should the Biden administration follow
through with plans initiated by the Trump administration.  **[[Russian
leaders surely realize Russia deploys more homeland]{.mark} defense
[interceptors]{.mark} than the United States, [and]{.mark} that their
[S-400]{.mark} and S-500 air defense systems [are comparable to
U.S.]{.mark} theater missile defense [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Finally, **[[Putin]{.mark} himself]{.underline}**
has **[[noted]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[by
2021]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 90 percent of **[Russia's [nuclear forces
will be]{.mark}]{.underline}** modernized and, in his words, "**[capable
of confidently [overcoming]{.mark} existing and [even projected missile
defense]{.mark} systems]{.underline}**."

**[[Could Poseidon really cause a radioactive

Great Britain leave a radioactive desert, unfit for anything for a long

**[[Critics]{.mark} will likely [respond]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
however, that **[[even if U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** leaders **[are
[unlikely to]{.mark}]{.underline}** be tempted by the option of a
**[[first strike, adversaries]{.mark} will [still believe]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is preparing]{.mark}]{.underline}** for
a first strike -- **[[thus increasing]{.mark} their [incentive]{.mark}
to strike first before they are]{.underline}** potentially **[disarmed.
[A]{.mark} major [unstated assumption]{.mark}]{.underline}** in this
criticism, of course, **[[is]{.mark} that [adversaries
will]{.mark}]{.underline}** indeed **[[believe they are
vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a U.S. first strike and their
threatened response will be ineffective for deterrence.
**[[Given]{.mark} the [authoritarian]{.mark} nature of]{.underline}**
the [**[regimes]{.underline}** in **[Moscow and Beijing, there will
be]{.underline}**]{.mark}, at least, **[[strong incentives for]{.mark}
civilian and military [officials to tell]{.mark} their]{.underline}**
respective **[[rulers]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[their [state is not
vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a U.S. first strike -- lest the
dictator wonder why they have failed to secure the state against a first
strike. Indeed, one pertinent historical example illustrates the
competing incentives that adversary leaderships will face should the
United States seriously pursue an expanded U.S. homeland missile defense
system. Then-Soviet leader Yuri Andropov responded to U.S. President
Reagan's announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative by stating
that the United States, in pursuing its missile defenses, was actually
pursuing a first strike capability against the Soviet Union; but
simultaneously stated that "All attempts at achieving military
superiority over the Soviet Union are futile. The Soviet Union will
never allow them to succeed. It will never be caught defenseless by any
threat."65

**[This]{.underline}** commentary, in fact, highlights what **[is likely
to be the]{.underline}** standard **[reaction by Russia, China, and
North Korea to the prospect of]{.underline}** significantly improved
**[U.S. homeland missile defenses. Their leaders will likely employ
apocalyptic]{.underline}**-sounding **[language]{.underline}**, meant to
shock and dismay U.S. and allied audiences and erode support for these
kinds of defenses. There are significant indications that this is
Russia's current strategy against the far more limited U.S. homeland
missile defense system today.66 When Russia's and China's coercive
strategies for achieving their revisionist aims depend upon
missile-based threats against the U.S. homeland, it should be no
surprise that they will protest loudly against any threat to their
strategy and goals. Critics, at this point, will interject that Russian,
Chinese, and North Korean leaders will still have reason to fear these
developments even if they do not overtly pursue their revisionist aims
-- the United States could still attempt a first strike to eliminate a
potential threat. In that case, under this assumption, adversary
leaderships have strong incentives to strike first before they are
potentially disarmed by the United States.

**[The obvious flaw]{.underline}** in the logic of this criticism **[is
that [adversary leaderships]{.mark} have very strong incentives not to
attempt a [first strike against]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** -- because **[doing so [would
turn]{.mark} the [possibility of]{.mark} suffering [existential damage
into]{.mark} the near [certainty]{.mark} of existential
damage]{.underline}**. The presence of **[[U.S.]{.mark} active
[defenses]{.mark} does [not degrade]{.mark} the [deterrent]{.mark}
effect [of]{.mark} U.S. [retaliatory
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, when faced with the
possibility of a United States with very credible damage limitation
capabilities, **[[an adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}** certainly
**[[could]{.mark} decide to [strike]{.mark} the United
States]{.underline}** with everything that it possessed, **[[but what
would this accomplish?]{.mark} U.S. [forces]{.mark} capable of
[delivering a]{.mark} devastating [response]{.mark} could [make]{.mark}
the adversary's [first strike the worst]{.mark} possible
[outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the adversary. **[It
would]{.underline}**, as Otto von Bismarck famously quipped, **[be a
case of committing]{.underline}** national **[suicide for fear of
death]{.underline}**. Historically, **[the [Soviet Union
continued]{.mark}]{.underline}** to function **[[under]{.mark} a
[U.S.]{.mark} nuclear [monopoly]{.mark}]{.underline}** from 1945-1949,
and clear U.S. strategic first strike advantages **[[from 1950
to]{.mark} the]{.underline}** early **[19[60]{.mark}s]{.underline}**,
even during times of crisis. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, likewise,
**[[has]{.mark} continued]{.underline}** to function **[while at a clear
disadvantage relative to the United States]{.underline}** for its entire
existence as a nuclear power, since 1964. In short, Russia, China, and
**[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [have decades]{.mark} of historical
experience [living under]{.mark} the [theoretical]{.mark} possibility of
a U.S. [first strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[without seeing]{.mark} a
first strike of [their own as a]{.mark} strategic
[necessity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. U.S. defenses to deter and defeat
coercive threats would not fundamentally change that circumstance for
them.

this New Threat," The National Interest,

Title: **[Russia\'s [Nukes in Space]{.mark}]{.underline}**? Why You
**[[Shouldn\'t Panic]{.mark} About this]{.underline}** New
**[Threat]{.underline}**

While this certainly suggests a serious concern for Defense officials
and lawmakers alike, **[official [reports]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[suggest]{.mark} that the]{.underline}** national security
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** in question **[[is not
imminent]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rather, the developing information
concerns emerging Russian military capabilities in space that the
American Defense apparatus will need to address in the long term. 

"I want to assure the American people **[there is no need for public
alarm]{.underline}**," House Speaker Mike
**[Johnson said]{.underline}** at the Capitol. "We are going to work
together to address this matter, as we do all sensitive matters that are
classified and beyond that, I'm not at liberty to disclose classified
information and really can't say much more, but we just want to assure
everyone steady hands are at the wheel, we're working on it, and there's
no need for alarm."

To that end, White House officials have similarly stated that while the
threat appears serious, **[[there are ways to]{.mark} "[contain]{.mark}"
it [without]{.mark} triggering mass [panic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Of
course, despite these reassurances, social media platforms like TikTok
were soon flooded with hyperbolic discussion, with some claiming that
"the more they say not to panic, the more I'm going to panic."

While more details about this threat are sure to be released in the
coming days, **[the [nature of]{.mark} a [space]{.mark}-based
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [does not suggest]{.mark} a [greater need for
concern]{.mark} over Russia's]{.underline}** existing nuclear
**[arsenal]{.underline}**, which includes large-yield intercontinental
nuclear missiles in sufficient volume to overwhelm American missile
defenses. **[[This is not]{.mark} a [new development, but rather]{.mark}
the very [basis for]{.mark} the long-term [nuclear deterrent strategy
known as M]{.mark}]{.underline}**utually
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ssured
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction.

So **[when [news]{.mark} broke]{.underline}** in February that **[Russia
[was]{.mark}]{.underline}** reportedly **[building]{.underline}** some
**[[nuclear]{.mark} connected [a]{.mark}nti-[sat]{.mark}ellite weapon, a
lot of people started scratching their heads. First, because of the
[manner in which]{.mark} the [news was leaked]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Congressman Mike **[[Turner]{.mark} seemed to [get ahead of both]{.mark}
the [process and]{.mark} the [intel]{.mark}ligence [itself, and
created]{.mark} a bit of a [panic]{.mark}]{.underline}** by demanding
full and immediate declassification of all information about the system.
**[[It now seems]{.mark} this was [alarmist, and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
perhaps **[[motivated by]{.mark} other [political
factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Leaks seemed to indicate that Russia
might be planning to launch a nuclear-powered anti-satellite directed
energy weapon into space. U.S. officials are reportedly telling allies
Russia could launch the system into space within the next year.  Details
became a little clearer, thanks to a public briefing by White House
Advisor Adm. John Kirby. Kirby confirmed that the planned system was
still in development, and President Biden later said it was not clear if
and when the system would be deployed. Importantly, Kirby also stated
that **[the [system]{.mark}, if deployed, [would violate]{.mark} the
[O]{.mark}]{.underline}**uter **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty of 1967. That phrase made clear that
the Russian program involved placing a nuclear weapon in outer space,
**[since deploying nuclear weapons in space is the main and only
specific constraint contained in the OST]{.underline}**. 

### AT: Sub Detection Link---2AC

#### SSBNs are resilient---detection wont' undermine second-strike

**Stefanick 25**, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Strobe Talbott Center on
Security, Strategy, and Technology, The Brookings Institution (Tom A.

There are two broad reasons that **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [**[China, and Russia]{.underline}**
**[will be capable of preserving]{.underline}**]{.mark} some level of
**[[survivable second-strike]{.mark} forces at sea over the coming two
decades]{.underline}**.

Search, detection, and tracking is difficult and can be disrupted

The first reason is that **[[new]{.mark} physical
[sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}** and data fusion algorithms
**[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}** always **[[be constrained
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the problems associated with searching for,
**[[identifying]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and tracking **[[multiple
SSBNs]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in the presence of background noise,
deliberate jamming]{.underline}**, sensors, **[and]{.underline}**
deceptive **[decoy signals]{.underline}** produced by adversaries.
**[There are]{.underline}** fundamental **[limits on the ability of
computer algorithms to extract useful information]{.underline}** about
submarines from noisy, cluttered, and deceptive data. **[[There are many
ways to inject uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}** into each of the many
stages of strategic ASW search, detection, identification, and
continuous tracking over the course of a long crisis or conventional
war.

Technology for undersea warfare is increasingly available for SSBN
protection

The second reason that entire **[[SSBN fleets will be difficult to
destroy]{.mark} with high confidence]{.underline}** stems from the fact
that **[improvements in sensor hardware and sensor data processing
applicable to tracking submarines at sea are likely to proceed in
parallel between the US]{.underline}** and its allies on the one hand,
**[and China and Russia on the other.]{.underline}** Advances in
searching for, detecting and tracking undersea threats including
submarines and other vehicles are easier to install, maintain, and use
in oceans close to home territory than they are as part of a distant
oceanic sensing architecture. **[Over the course of a long conflict,
[combinations of existing and new sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ocean
vehicles, **[and signal processing methods [are likely to be
successfully used for]{.mark} [defending one's own
SSBNs]{.mark}]{.underline}** near home territories **[[before they are
widely and effectively deployed for the]{.mark} [much more challenging
and costly tasks of detecting, tracking, and destroying]{.mark} the
[SSBNs of]{.mark} a distant [adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For the
United States, this will provide the intelligence community with
opportunities to collect data about the state of Russian and Chinese ASW
technology.

Conclusions

This chapter has explained the **[[ASW]{.underline}]{.mark}** processes
of search, detection, and tracking and shown how existing and emerging
**[[tech]{.mark}nology [will]{.mark} tend to [favor the pro-SSBN
side]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I have emphasized the probabilistic nature
of ASW search and the complexity of multi-target tracking in the
presence of noise and false alarms, since these are some of the
essential sources of uncertainty in ASW. **[[Clever operations,
logistical advantages, and tech]{.mark}nology [will enable the pro-SSBN
side to increase uncertainty]{.mark} about their SSBN fleet [more
quickly and cost-effectively than the anti-SSBN side can sweep it
away]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The following sections summarize my
conclusions about the prospects for SSBN security for the United States,
China, and Russia.

US SSBN Security

The US will continue to leverage its geographic and oceanographic
advantages to keep the extraordinarily stealthy SSBNs of the Ohio and
Columbia classes secure in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This does
not mean that adversary attack submarines can be ignored as a threat to
US SSBNs as they leave port to begin patrols, however. Relatively quiet
Russian submarines now patrol in the Atlantic and the Pacific, and while
these submarines would be highly unlikely to detect and track US SSBNs,
the US maintains measures to protect them as they transit to the open
ocean.Footnote122 It is always possible that over the next 20 years, the
US Navy could choose to adopt some of these pro-SSBN measures to disrupt
the potential threats to SSBNs near its ports.

Space-based architectures for surveillance of US SSBNs over millions of
square kilometers would require a large number of mainly active sensors
revisiting critical ocean areas on a regular basis. It is critical for
the US to continue to investigate the physics of the ocean and test new
sensor concepts in order to avoid missing some new combination of
physical phenomenology, sensor combinations, data fusion, and tracking
architectures that might yield some ability to track US SSBNs. However,
**[the [global sensing]{.mark} and communication [architectures]{.mark}
required to establish a reliable long-term surveillance threat against
US SSBNs [would be visible and could be countered]{.mark} using all
manner of deception, jamming, and decoys well in advance.]{.underline}**
With strong support for research in oceanography, sensors, and signal
processing, as well as SSBNs and their crews, US SSBNs at sea are
essentially invulnerable now and will likely remain so for the next
20 years and beyond.

China's SSBN Security

It appears that China is developing systems capable of increasing the
probability of finding SSNs that enter their bastion areas. In the event
of an intense crisis or conflict, Chinese SSBNs could go to sea and the
PLA Navy could put in place defensive measures against US SSNs such as
decoys, mines, and surveillance systems in these bastion areas. If SSBNs
are not continuously trailed over the course of their patrols or some
other means to track them is not available, the time required to search
for them is likely to stretch into many months and be highly uncertain.
As this search time increases, the opportunities for pro-SSBN
countermeasures grows.

In a crisis scenario, there would be an increased demand for US SSNs
from the Pacific Fleet to support many tasks unrelated to strategic ASW.
The most prominent example is that SSNs would be key elements in any
military capability to deny the Chinese Navy from operating in a
scenario involving a threat to Taiwan. In addition, it is likely that US
SSNs would be used in such a crisis to monitor key locations from the
Bering Strait to Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, to the coasts of North
Korea. US SSNs will also be called on to protect US aircraft carriers
and critical logistics ships from attacks by Chinese submarines and
ships in the Philippine Sea, to Hawaii, and to the continental US.

Although there is no evidence in China's military policy writings that
the PLA sees a benefit to placing its SSBNs at risk in order to draw in
US attack submarines,Footnote123 the fact remains that US attack
submarines allocated to the strategic ASW mission of trailing Chinese
SSBNs will not be available for these other urgent missions. The
survivability of Chinese SSBNs will be somewhat conditional on decisions
by the US to deploy SSNs in direct support of conventional warfighting
objectives.

**[[Future developments in]{.mark} uncrewed systems such as
[UUVs]{.mark} or USVs for anti-SSBN operations in bastions [do not
appear to have an overwhelming advantage against
countermeasures]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that could be developed
against them]{.underline}**. **[Uncrewed air and surface vehicles would
likely face direct attacks as long as China was able to use surveillance
radars over their bastions]{.underline}**. Uncrewed undersea vehicles
would need to transit relatively frequently in and out of bastion areas,
and would be subject to all the delousing measures and deception
measures that would be used against SSNs. **[[Uncrewed systems are not
likely to pose a large threat]{.mark} to Chinese SSBNs operating in
bastions.]{.underline}**

Russia's SSBN Security

Most of **[the [technical arguments for China's SSBN survivability
apply]{.mark} also [to]{.mark} those of [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**
so I will not repeat them here. It is worth addressing the rapidly
changing geopolitical environment in Russia's Arctic bastion areas. The
most recent intelligence threat assessments from both the United States
and Norway indicate that because the war in Ukraine has weakened
Russia's conventional capability, it's nuclear capabilities have taken
on greater importance.Footnote124 In this context, the Russian SSBNs in
the Northern Fleet are an critical nuclear capability, leading to
increased importance on the defense of the northern bastion and the
Barents Sea in addition to carrying out longer SSBN patrols in the
Barents Sea.Footnote125 Russia's SSBNs and some attack submarines are
already relatively difficult to track covertly using US SSNs, and Russia
appears to be investing in the kinds of undersea systems to disrupt NATO
surveillance, to enhance its own undersea surveillance, and to provide
decoys for SSBNs.

With the accession of Finland into NATO, the most sensitive bases
supporting SSBNs in the Russian Barents Sea and the White Sea are now
within 200 kilometers of NATO territory. While Norway has typically
constrained the use of its territory and airspace for intelligence
gathering against Russian installations on the Kola Peninsula near
Norway, Finland now does allow the US to fly intelligence-gathering
flights in Finnish territory to collect data from Russia.Footnote126
Thus, **[[Russia is likely to continue]{.mark} to focus efforts on
[securing its Northern Fleet]{.mark} region in order [to protect]{.mark}
the [SSBNs]{.mark} operating there.]{.underline}**

In the Pacific, Russia's excessively broad interpretation of the United
Nations decision regarding its continental shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk,
as well as the increasing militarization of the southern Kuril Islands
have resulted in a more militarized perimeter around that
bastion.Footnote127 With the greatly expanded presence of NATO near
Russia's Barents Sea bastion, the protection of the Sea of Okhotsk for
Russian SSBNs is likely to continue to remain an important part of
Russia's strategic nuclear basing. As in the case of China, the degree
to which the US can threaten Russian SSBNs depends to a large extent on
the level of commitment that the US makes early in a crisis to
attempting to trail Russian SSBNs. **[As the pro-SSBN technologies
improve and become more cost-effective]{.underline}**, **[[it is less
likely that a moderate commitment]{.mark} of US SSNs [to]{.mark} the
[anti-SSBN mission]{.mark} over the course of an extended conflict
[would have a decisive impact on eliminating Russia's SSBN
fleet.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

companies can help in this respect, particularly if they can leverage

interceptor system and Ukraine's remarkably successful attempts at
wartime sensor integration.

Perhaps more importantly, since there is currently no Arctic security
forum that includes Russia, Arctic states should use NATO's established
dialogue channels with Moscow through the NATO-Russia Council, as Dr.
Rebecca Pincus has advocated. While NATO's military function would be
counterproductive, its political-organizational function could help to
lower the likelihood of miscommunication. This forum would also open the
possibility for greater collaboration on rules to govern the region as
it becomes more accessible to other actors.
