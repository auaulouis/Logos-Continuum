#### Technological advancement enables [securitization]{.underline} in the Arctic. Vote [neg]{.underline} for a politics of [sociotechnical imagination]{.underline} to upend [securitizing uses]{.underline} of technology.

Benjamin **Johnson 24**, (Benjamin T. Johnson, This world of tomorrow:
sociotechnical imaginaries of security in the Canadian Arctic, Critical
Studies on Security), DOI: 10.1080/21624887.2024.2304413

[The security imaginary is a **social and material
expression**]{.underline} of an insecure world and [conditions the
essential elements, including policy]{.underline}, that partially make
up that world. A specific technology's relationship to the social at the
level of materiality is not pre-given, meaning that [technology results
from a particular technological imperative produced through specific
meanings and practices]{.underline} (Davidshofer, Jeandesboz, and
Ragazzi 2017, 207; Müller 2015, 34). Within security considerations,
[[technological development is grounded in]{.mark} specific]{.underline}
social, political, economic, cultural, and other [[normative]{.mark}
ideas embedded within [frameworks of understanding linked to **the
state's interests and ways of being secure**]{.mark} in the
world.]{.underline}

In a more general sense, following influential accounts of imaginaries
by Said (Orientalism), Anderson (the Nation), and others,
[[sociotechnical imaginaries 'are collectively held]{.mark},
institutionally stabilized, and publicly performed **[visions of
desirable futures]{.mark}**, animated by shared [understandings
of]{.mark} forms of [social life and]{.mark} social [order attainable
through]{.mark}]{.underline}, and supportive of, [[advances in]{.mark}
science and [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}' (Jasanoff 2015, 4).
[[The]{.mark} sociotechnical [imaginary occupies the intellectual space
between **cultural production and representation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and material iteration through co-production. Coproduction indicates the
reciprocal and [[relational nature of]{.mark} sociotechnical
[imaginaries]{.mark} as [exist]{.mark}ing [through]{.mark} the mutually
constitutive [forces of **semiotic representation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and material-technological articulation (Jasanoff 2015, 3; see Gregory
1995; McCarthy 2021; Vonderau 2017).

[[The concept of]{.mark} sociotechnical [imaginaries is helpful in
analysing the]{.mark}]{.underline} Canadian [[Arctic as a security
space]{.underline}]{.mark} in several respects. First, while classic
securitisation theory focuses on the discursive construction of security
in response to an existential threat, it is traditionally limited in its
dealing with '\[c\]onstructions of danger that lie below the threshold
of existentialism, such as the concept of risk' (Methmann and Rother
2012, 325) in favour of an event focused view, where [[securitisation is
**premised on a binary** of]{.mark}]{.underline} before
([[non-security]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} after
([[security]{.underline}]{.mark}) (Huysmans 2011, 377). Further,
securitisation may be institutionalised such that '\[t\]he need for
drama in establishing securitization falls away because it is implicitly
assumed that [when we talk of this issue, we are by definition in the
**area of urgency'**]{.underline} (Buzan et al. 1998, 28). [[Within
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Canadian [[Arctic, the issue of sovereignty
embodies the **degree of institutionalization** deemed **necessary for
securitisation**]{.mark}. Sovereignty [exemplifies
a]{.mark}]{.underline} ready-made [[set of characteristics
legitimising]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [[security
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} based on those taken-for-granted
qualities, particularly the idea that sovereignty is an inviolable right
of all states. [[Within the contemporary sociotechnical imaginary,
the]{.mark} Canadian [Arctic is not vulnerable to any one existential
threat but rather **a multitude**]{.mark} **of risks**.]{.underline}
Hence, Canada is concerned with technological solutions to defend Arctic
sovereignty through sensing. Here, the state is recognised as a critical
political actor in defining and providing security. However, the state
is not the only security actor, as literature on security governance
demonstrates the role of non-state actors (e.g. Krahmann 2005; Lea and
Stenson 2007). Nonetheless, [[the state **retains an explicit security
role**]{.underline}]{.mark}, specifically as that [which legitimates the
normative basis upon which sociotechnical imaginaries are]{.underline}
formed and [deployed]{.underline} (e.g. through policy) and provides the
necessary material resources for those imaginaries to be acted upon and
materially realised. In sum, [[sociotechnical]{.mark} [imaginaries
provide a robust framework to]{.mark} interrogate and
**[destabilise]{.mark} the [technological solutionism]{.mark}** [that
underlines]{.mark}]{.underline} instrumental and [[rationalist notions
of what technology]{.underline}]{.mark} is and [[can
do]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially by the state, [[in the **name of
security**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Food Security In the Arctic, the question of food security is often
raised27 as communities experience reduced accessibility and
availability of food. Climate change is often pointed out as a major
concern, and for good reason. Food security discourses pertain to access
to and availability of country foods and the erosion of "traditional"
subsistence hunting and gathering activities.28 However, food security
is a complex problem that cannot be reduced to climate change alone.
Researchers estimate that 70 per cent of preschool children in the
Canadian territory of Nunavut live in food-insecure homes.29 The social,
political, cultural, and economic sources that contribute to making the
problem so massive are also identified.30 How can "food security" be
linked to cultural translation and the creation of a transformative
space for newness? Food Insecurity in Nunavut Since 2012, the Inuit
inhabitants of several communities in Nunavut have been protesting and
demonstrating in the streets and in front of shops as well as boycotting
stores, all to draw attention to high food prices and their low income
levels (see also Loukacheva in chapter 10). Despite government
subsidies, more and more people are struggling to make ends meet, and
the protesters point to the territory's rising cost of living, low
average incomes, insufficient social assistance, lack of employment, and
the federal government's failed Nutrition North subsidy program.31 To
develop a long-term food security action plan, prominent Inuit convened
the Nunavut Food Security Coalition in 2011.32 On a grassroots level, by
2016 more than 24,300 people had joined the Facebook group called
Feeding My Family.33 According to one protester, "they're just robbing
us, man! I'm a single individual and if I were to do my groceries here
all the time I'd have to spend most, if not all my income. And that's
just sick."34 [The food security problem in Nunavut is real, and people
interpret it as emerging out of a **social, economic, and political
context** that produces societal inequality, cultural disrespect, and
resource insufficiency. Thus, [food insecurity is not just about food
accessibility and availability; it is being **translated into issues**
of political failure]{.mark}, uneven development, and companies' profit
strategies, which have eroded a healthy "future self." [The issue of
food security in Nunavut]{.mark} has been [used as a **platform** for
raising]{.mark} these [issues and for **drawing attention** to how
northern residents have been used, forgotten, and
marginalized]{.mark}]{.underline}. One commenter in the Facebook group
explicitly draws the debate in that direction. That person sees the
protest strategy as aimed in the wrong direction: "By boycotting
NorthMart \[the retail store in many northern Canadian towns\], we
concentrate on the wrong end of the equation, let politicians off the
hook and ensure people stay hungry."35 The "future bad" that is
anticipated on the basis of the devastating contemporary food problems
invites reflection on the social context and the political institutions.
[Addressing food as a security issue calls for a certain **collective
responsibility and action** and also, in this case, points at how broken
promises and marginalization are deeply linked to the reproduction of
daily life. The "**transformative power** of everyday
life]{.underline}"36 [emerges when protesters in Nunavut argue for
**structural** and political changes, pointing to the inequality in the
distribution of welfare accessibility and systemic economic illogics.
[The everyday has been turned inside out so that **structural problems**
are exposed]{.mark}. The protesters shame and blame, as well as
criticize and hope]{.underline}. The protests (and thus the whole
problem of the collapse of food [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} in
Nunavut) [can be seen [as]{.mark} the [**public arena** of a **social
movement** calling for]{.mark} a process of [**transformation** so that
the "future bad" can be avoided through **structural changes**]{.mark}
and political action]{.underline}. Basically, the protesters are arguing
for outside intervention to remove food insecurity but have left a trail
of structural and critical afterthoughts based on their experiences. Due
to the structural aspects of production, distribution, and consumption
of food, [[questions of]{.mark} "[food security" are never just about
getting]{.mark} proper [food on the table; they always also]{.mark}
**reflect (and [critique]{.mark}**) the [**structural entanglements**
that emerge when **imagining** the "future bad."]{.mark} The public
reflections on food insecurity in Nunavut bring the **past, the present,
and the future** tightly together; [this]{.mark} not only addresses the
question of whom to become but also [injects **critical hope** and
newness into the **discussion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Yet Inuit remain
confident that as a culture they will not only survive these changes but
thrive," Lessee Papatsie and colleagues explain. "Local solutions to
mobilise communities to address food insecurity are emerging."37 Food
Security in Alaska In Alaska as well, the question of food security is
at the top of the agenda. There, Inuit communities are concerned, among
other things, about the problems of climate change and its impact on the
accessibility, stability, and availability of country food. They have
experienced dramatic changes in the environment on which they base their
livelihood.38 The influence on accessibility, availability, and
predictability of animals and plants important for their communities'
food security is evident. To address issues related to environmental
health, the Inuit Circumpolar Council (Alaska) has formulated the
"Alaskan Inuit Food Security Conceptual Framework: How to Assess the
Arctic from an Inuit Perspective."39 ICC-Alaska argues that a paradigm
shift is needed: "one must be willing to attempt to understand the Inuit
culture to know what the Inuit mean when they talk about food
security."40 Besides pointing out how Inuit appreciate, depend upon, and
use the environment, ICC-Alaska emphasizes how Inuit culture and social
reproduction are intrinsically linked to a healthy environment.41 The
framework identifies a large number of problems, barriers, and concerns
related to the maintenance of food security and puts forward a number of
actions to be taken. The strong link that ICC-Alaska has forged between
cultural and environmental integrity explicitly connects food security
to food sovereignty. In this way, it also directly integrates Inuit
control, involvement, and influence in, for example, environmental
management structures and policies. Food sovereignty is also thought of
as a conceptual way to expand (or confirm) the desire, need, and right
to govern how food is obtained, managed, processed, stored, and
consumed, and to have a decisive say in how this is prioritized.42 The
"future bad" from this food security perspective is a future in which
decision-making power lies outside Inuit communities and where their
control/influence over their own fate is absent or diminishing. By
making such a strong claim to their own right and responsibility to
manage resources as part of reflections on "food security," Alaskan
Inuit link self-governance and environmental management with everyday
life. They infuse respect for Indigenous rights across all scales
because environmental and community health is closely connected to
dynamics outside the sphere of daily life (e.g., transboundary pollution
and international trade bans). Self-governance is understood to include
the capacity to decide on simple things such as what is to be sold in
stores as well as on complex issues such as resource management
policies.43 The emerging "future bad" is one in which Inuit are
marginalized and lack the power to influence daily life and the
direction and momentum of societal and cultural change. The issue of
"food security" condenses this Inuit concern for being able to pursue
social and cultural reproduction with the desire to play a decisive role
in deciding their own direction. The issue of food security is perceived
by Inuit as urgent and necessary; so is ICC-Alaska's proposal to use a
food security lens defined by them: "There is no time to waste; we must
begin to make changes today, not just for the sake of our culture but
also for the sake of the entire Arctic ecosystem."44 Inuit throughout
the Arctic are experiencing rapid changes, and ICC-Alaska finds those
changes to be accelerating, especially those related to climate change.
It is pushing for change, and in calling for policy and structural
changes through its own food security lens, it is positioning Inuit as
in control of their own future. ICC-Alaska's recommendations are quite
elaborate in terms of integrating Indigenous perspectives, knowledge,
and ambitions. ICC-Alaska elegantly links its food security talk to food
sovereignty. In doing so, it is not only linking security issues to
sovereignty issues but also infusing a temporal dimension within a
particular community (Alaska Native people) in an uncertain and unstable
context. The entire framework is not set up to protect, preserve, and
maintain Indigenous culture; rather, it is set up to allow them to
influence the necessary newness that they hope will enter their world.
In that way, they hope to influence whom they will become in a time of
rapid change in which the "future bad" is deeply felt. The Canadian food
security case points our attention toward a security issue linked to
immediate daily problems supposedly generated by the dynamics of
particular postcolonial political and economic arrangements, whereas the
Alaskan case underscores a long-term perspective where Inuit want to
have a larger say in how resources are managed and for whose benefit. In
both cases, [security involves addressing existential threats to
particular collectives of various orders and scales. As such **security
claims** are made, the communities (and their right to social
reproduction) are evoked **simultaneously**]{.underline}. Morten Axel
Pedersen and Martin Holdbraad point out that [[we "need to ask **what
visions** of the future]{.mark} and of time itself [are at stake when
security becomes an issue]{.mark} for people: [**what, and when**, are
times of security?"]{.mark}]{.underline}45 [In]{.underline} the
[Canadian and Alaskan cases, [**different temporalities** emerge out of
the security talk and **different agencies** are made
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline} In both cases, however, food [[security
talk]{.mark} comes to be [about **transformation** and]{.mark} the
[infusion of newness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conclusion Faced with "future
bads," Inuit have to deal with enormous risks, dangers, and threats.
They also need to negotiate and invent solutions in cooperation with
authorities who often have different cultural and political ideas (and
agendas) and thus subscribe to different programs for handling "future
bads." I have argued that "security thinking" and "security talk"
produce a transformative space in which it is possible for communities
and individuals to translate themselves and their identities as
communities and individuals. The concept of cultural translation also
directs our analytical attention toward processes, politics, and
meetings driven by this fundamental question: "Whom are we to become
when dealing with "future bads?" In this way, translations of risk and
security are deeply entangled in negotiations of future identities. If
security talk is an act of cultural translation, newness is analytically
infused. Security studies can then also focus on the highly difficult
but productive tasks of negotiating the "future self" to come. This take
on security talk is based on an analytical attentiveness to discourses.
It follows some of the ideas of securitization theory as developed by
the Copenhagen School,46 which invites new questions into security as a
(political) discourse by asking who securitizes, on what issues, for
whom, why, and with what results. However, the analysis in this chapter
does not see "security" as a passing from one social order ("ordinary
politics") to another (the extrapolitical realm of "emergency"), as the
Copenhagen School does. Rather, it sees "security talk" carrying
transformative and productive power to political and cultural projects
at different scales as an act of infusing newness and change, here and
now. In doing so, security talk creates room for individual and
collective reflection driven by ideas of the "future bad." It is not
about preserving a referent object, but about creating alternative
futures to ensure durability over time (sur-vivre). One enters into a
process of cultural translation where one's future self as the ultimate
other in the "future bad" is the referent point. The Transformative
Power of "Security" Talk 247 Pedersen and Holbraad also underscore that
[[it is]{.mark} "near-[**impossible** to think of security without also
imagining]{.mark} particular [forms of **reproduction, projection, and
transformation** of various units of life."]{.mark}47 Thus, security
talk is not only about what may happen but also about what **could
happen** if something was done. The question "**Whom to become**?" is
**imminent** in issues **we demarcate as "security issues"** and is a
pressing one to ask in "**the New Arctic."** It may be productive to
integrate [such questions]{.mark} as they [open up]{.mark} for [new
voices, new perspectives, **new narratives**, and new encounters when we
address issues demarcated as security issues. When new modes of
description]{.mark} and anticipation [come into being, **new
possibilities for action** come into]{.mark} being in
[**consequence**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The New Arctic Since the end of the Cold War, [environmental and climate
change issues have been pivotal to the public's perception of the
Arctic. That region is no longer viewed as a cold, marginal,
military-strategic place; it is now seen as an open maritime space of
global importance to our understanding of climate change
dynamics.]{.underline} The Arctic is now viewed as a place of extreme
physical and ecosystemic transformation, those changes having been set
in motion by rising temperatures, among other factors, with severe
consequences for the Arctic's inhabitants. [A new landscape of risk and
opportunity has been produced.]{.underline} Additionally, political
changes with respect to the recognition of Indigenous peoples' rights
have positioned these peoples as strong collective rights-holders.
Various governments, treaties, land claims, and other political
structures have led to Indigenous peoples' increased self-determination
and changed the political modus operandi. The international cooperation
that has developed under the auspices of the Arctic Council reminds us
that rights-holders and stakeholders have been provided with new
political arenas and tools to address and influence regional dynamics.2
[This landscape of risk and opportunity and these various partnerships,
governments, and multi-level cooperative projects together comprise the
"New Arctic."]{.underline} To Think with "Security" [Security thinking
is a particular kind of cultural and political act that makes it
possible to transcend place and time while reproducing and reflecting on
existing ideas of what constitutes stability and responsibility.
Security thinking thus triggers a particular space-time and demarcates a
space for agency, fear, hope, and promise. I argue that a security issue
can be understood as a productive act of establishing a space for
renegotiating causalities, subject positions, morality, and dominant
ways of scaling]{.underline} (and is thus a little bit more than a
reflection on a "referent object" and "agent of security," which are
often referred to in security studies). [Security is a powerful concept
as it calls for moral action and can place human existence at the
forefront in particular ways]{.underline}. This perspective, which I
suggest here, is based on a post-structuralist approach to security and
is inspired by the Copenhagen School of security studies.3 Whereas the
Copenhagen School focuses on the complexities of the securitization
process, and thus primarily points to how security issues arise, I want
to turn our attention to the [productive potential of these
securitization processes. When we approach "[security talk]{.mark},"
"security thinking," and "security issues" [as a **transformative
space**, we may see not only]{.mark} **different understandings** of
who/what [is in need of being secured, from what threats]{.mark}, by
what actors, [and through what means, but also **whom we become** when
secured.]{.mark}]{.underline} I see "security talk" not only as a
conservative obsession with maintaining and protecting what is treasured
from a perceived threat, but also as a productive and creative act of
imagining and negotiating who we are and who we want to become. Security
talk is thus also about the "future social." Basically, [[security
talk]{.mark} can be seen [as an act of
**future-making**]{.mark}.]{.underline}4 [This task of imagining the
"future social" can be approached as a **sociocultural action**, where
**[communities (at all scales) and individuals]{.mark}** caught in
**fluid landscapes** of (real or imagined) risks and threats **[mobilize
new understandings]{.mark}** of "community" and
"personhood]{.underline}" -- feared, anticipated, or desired. They may
pursue what Homi Bhabha calls a "cultural translation,"5 which he
perceives as a process whereby people are compelled to revise their own
reference systems, norms, and judgments when faced with other systems of
significance. I propose to view the constructed images of the "future
social" as an "other system of significance." [[When communities]{.mark}
are [attentive toward]{.mark} other [futures]{.mark} -- bad or good --
[people creatively try to establish a]{.mark} vision, to anticipate a
storyline or a [**line of future development**.]{.mark} Security
thinking is thus able to evoke **creative agency** that brings the
unprecedented into effect by way of imaginative power, thereby expanding
the community's awareness of itself. The transformative potentialities
of security discussions can thus be conceptualized as an act of cultural
translation where something is lost and something is gained. So [when
people engage in security talk]{.mark} they are not only lost in
translation as they struggle to understand the times to come -- [they
are also]{.mark} creatively [**producing something** new]{.mark}. I thus
see the translation as an activity inherent in any situation that
relates to a security issue in which people have to imagine a "future
bad." The idea of a "future bad" forces people to confront themselves
with their own "future self" as "other," so to speak -- one could see it
as a "cultural encounter" with an imagined future self. The analysis of
the construction of the "dangerous other" is often an inherent aspect of
the study of security discourses.]{.underline}6 Moreover, the processes
of "othering" that I address are linked to how one's future self (as
other) is negotiated, constructed, and imagined, as well as the
productive aspects this entails[. Images of "future bad" and questions
of security and risk create a **transformative space** where people
**rethink and rescale** constituent parts of society and
identities]{.underline}. It is this process that can be approached as
cultural translation. I am not talking about cultural translation as a
process taking place between closed and bounded systems where different
perceptions of risk, threats, and security meet and are to be grasped
through translation and negotiation (e.g., between local and state
perspectives and concerns). I see cultural translation as a creative act
of cultural production taking place in a carved-out transformative space
where there is high attentiveness to the negotiated ideas of self and
other.7 Security thinking can be approached as an act of cultural
translation where neither the original nor the translation are fixed and
enduring categories because they do not have an essential quality, and
both are constantly transformed in space and time.8 In cultural
translation neither "start" nor "target" is stable or entirely separate.
Despite this uneasy but productive relationship between self and other,
original and translation, start and target, the concept of cultural
translation points our attention toward the high alertness of
border-crossing in space-time and concerns about what such
border-crossings may entail with respect to what is lost and what is
gained. For Homi Bhabha, cultural translation is an attentiveness to
hybridity. Walter Benjamin even argues that translation gives the
"original" (which he sees as open, living, and unfixed) an afterlife or
a prolonged life (Fortleben).9 But Fortleben is, according to Bhabha,
the essence of survival (in French sur-vivre). Bhabha applies Benjamin's
ideas to his understanding of cultural translation in the following way:
"If hybridity is heresy, then to blaspheme is to dream. To dream not of
the past or present, nor the continuous present; it is not the nostalgic
dream of tradition, not the Utopian dream of modern progress; it is the
dream of translation as 'survival,' as Jacques Derrida translates the
'time' of Benjamin's concept of the after-life of translation, as
sur-vivre, the act of living on borderlines."10 [This state of dynamic
self-translation is essential in "security talk," where the "**future
bad" emerges** as a border to apprehend and deal with.]{.underline} What
are the implications of seeing things as I propose here? If we, for
example, look at climate-related security issues we quickly end up in
the study of impacts, vulnerability, and resilience. I suggest, however,
that [it may also be [**productive** to **redirect our focus** away from
the]{.mark} **usual [question]{.mark}** [of "**How** do we deal with the
risks]{.mark}?" [toward the question of "**Whom are we to become** when
dealing with the risks]{.mark}]{.underline}[?]{.mark}"11 The point of
departure is that [the question]{.underline} "Whom are we to become?"
[is tantamount to thinking of communities on **another scale** and to
creating new images of social life.]{.underline} And if we ask this
question, [I think [it has an impact on]{.mark} the [**knowledge
regime** we have established around security
studies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[suggest]{.mark}s a [human- centred approach]{.mark}]{.underline},
which [is further [amplified by]{.mark} the '[environmental'

those who have since used their concept for their own empirical studies,
is also telling: [discourse tends to be understood [as human exchanges,
rep]{.mark}resentation[s, and social practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Despite assertions to the contrary, therefore, the place of the
non-human in environmental imaginary research generally seems to be more
passive than active. This is somewhat problematic. While appreciating
the all-too-real problems with speaking simplistically of 'nature', I
would nevertheless try to work out the implications of talking about
'nature' imaginaries rather than 'environmental' ones. I propose that
[[nature imaginaries]{.mark} be defined [as]{.mark} particular, usually
unarticulated, [premises held]{.mark} by [certain]{.mark} groups of
[people about how human-nonhuman relations should be structured]{.mark}
in order to ensure a morally sound future. [Such premises exert]{.mark}
their [influence on thinking, talk and action by]{.mark} diverse

Cooper (2008: 98) writes that, in the wake of 9/11, '**[[permanent
warfare has become the new]{.mark} driving [force behind US economic
growth, feeding off its own ineptitude]{.mark} [as it generates
a]{.mark} seemingly inexhaustible [demand for security services]{.mark}
of all kinds']{.underline}**. Rather than a demand for security services
'of all kinds', field research suggests the [[rise of a particular type
of civil security equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe that is
nevertheless embedded in longer histories of security and emergence.
Drawing on observations at security trade shows and stakeholder
workshops, the objective of this section is to explore the conceptual
exchanges that have taken place between the military domain and civil
security. I suggest that **[dominant civil aspirations of [distributing
threat information, fusing data and visualizing incidents have]{.mark}
their [roots in military logics and]{.mark} concepts earlier formulated
in the context of [the RMA]{.mark} in the USA.]{.underline}**

[The **[growing number of security trade fairs and exhibitions]{.mark}**
that are organized in and outside Europe are interesting sites for
studying the trends and themes in civil security.]{.underline} More
conceptually, these are also locations where we can analyse the
co-constitutions and enactments of civil security and the market. [The
organization of security trade events is not a new
phenomenon]{.underline} (Guittet and Jeandesboz, 2010), but **[today's
exhibitions [indicate that a shift has taken place]{.mark} from a focus
on traditional [private security equipment]{.mark} (e.g. access
protection, CCTV applications, etc.) [to civil security
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, the organizers of the
German Security Essen exhibition claim that it is [the international
meeting place 'for solutions relating to everything to do with civil
security']{.underline}, focusing on [[technology for the civil
domain]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the security of public spaces,
transport security and 'systems solutions'.5 [[The Counter Terrorism

world's largest event concentrating on 'current modern day
risks']{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.mark} new fields of concern such as
[international terrorism and [intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
also **[[cyber-security, critical national infrastructure protection,
and maritime security and anti-piracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.6 [[At the
same time]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [trade [fairs]{.mark} that I have
visited continue to [cater to the average]{.mark} police
[officer]{.mark}, fireman or security guard, exhibiting locks,
protective clothing, bollards, fences, nets, guns and video
cameras]{.underline} -- whether **[[presented in more 'digitized' or
sophisticated forms]{.underline}]{.mark}** or not. In other words, we
find that there are no complete rewritings of the 'old' with the 'new'
technology (see also De Goede et al., this issue). Rather, [they
converge and coevolve, indicating that [the civil market]{.mark} indeed
[emerges in multiple]{.mark} and sometimes contradictory
[ways]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Still, observations at these security trade shows pinpoint [[a number of
civil themes and technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, these
concern **[[equipment at the intersection of the civil and defence
domains]{.mark} that have their origins in defence but [correspond to
what are claimed to be new and 'high-level' vulnerabilities in civil
security]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Ecorys Research and Consulting, 2009:
18). Many of these, in addition, relate to a growing [concern for
bioterrorist attacks]{.underline} (see Cooper, 2008; Elbe et al., this
issue). CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and
explosives) [detection equipment [developed for]{.mark} civil targets
such as [airports and harbours, mail distribution centres and
mass]{.mark} (sports) [events]{.mark}]{.underline} provides one example
of **[[dual-use technologies often shown at security
exhibition]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. Other technologies that emerge as
civil applications of defence technology are different kinds of
**[[sensors and scanners used for crisis
management]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g. '**[[microfluidic' scanners and
'smart dust' scanners]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and border and
[infrastructure [protection]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. **[[acoustic and
thermal sensors and lasers]{.underline}]{.mark}**) (Commission of the
European Communities, 2004: 18--19).

More specifically, what is emerging as a key feature of the civil
security market is the **[[integration]{.mark} or interoperability [of
dual-use technologies]{.mark} and sensors]{.underline}**.7 Examples of
such '[integrated systems solutions' shown at security exhibitions
involve **[software tools]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the
[[integrat]{.mark}ion of [data from physical security
devices]{.mark}]{.underline} (access control, video, sensors, etc.),
**[[enabling the 'tracking of suspects as they move on live and recorded
video']{.underline}]{.mark}**,8 or [security management systems for
asset, critical infrastructure and perimeter protection]{.underline}
(involving video surveillance, fence protection and different forms of
(leak) detection systems).9 The focus on integrated security systems in
civil security markets is echoed in Figure 2, which featured in the
Ecorys study on the EU security market. The image provides an overview
of the type of equipment produced by the European security market,

security market at the base

### Conservation

#### Rhetorics of conservation paint the north as wild, vast, and untamed.

Anthropology at MacEwan University "Arctic political imaginaries:
crafting technologies and inhabiting infrastructure"
https://doi.org/10.1080/1472586X.2017.1324738

[This [image of the north as a vast, untouched, and **uninhabited
wilderness**]{.mark} was also [exemplified in]{.mark} Harper's speeches
about [land conservation initiatives]{.mark}.]{.underline} Conservation
was another one of the arms of the former federal government's Northern
Strategy, including the creation of national parks in northern Canada.
Like Harper's speeches about resource extraction, [the announcements of
[the creation of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[national parks]{.mark} similarly
[rely on the rhetoric of vast and untouched wilderness]{.mark}. For
example, [the land is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[referred to as natural and
unspoiled]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[[Clean air, clean water, clean land, and natural wilderness]{.mark}
areas]{.underline} that will be there for our children and our
children's children. (Prime Minister Harper announces support for
national land conservation campaign, 14 March 2007, King City)

As with resource extraction, [[the land is also described as vast and
wild:]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Yet even Canadians who have never seen [its wild and vast
beauty]{.mark}]{.underline} [know in their heart that the North is
Canada's call to greatness,]{.underline} and that our country's biggest
dreams lie in our highest latitudes. (PM's announcement in Cambridge
Bay, 23 August 2012, Cambridge Bay, Nunavut)

Like the speeches about resource extraction, [the policy speeches about
[northern conservation initiatives]{.mark} [draw on the notions of the
north as an environmental]{.mark}]{.underline} (rather than a resource)
[[frontier: **a vast, untamed**]{.mark}
**[wilderness]{.mark}**]{.underline} again filled with treasures (the
natural environment, not the subsurface resources). [[The]{.mark} [image
created]{.mark} when discussing conservation [is]{.mark} again [a
vast]{.mark} untouched and [unknown landscape needing]{.mark}
[government intervention]{.mark} and strategies to best
use.]{.underline}

### Domain Awareness

#### The 1AC's Continuance of cold war imperatives through the expansion of Domain Awareness allows sociotechnically securitizing the Arctic. It has now become a cybernetic continent.

//ArjaSarkar✨

This environment resulted in Canada's joint efforts with the United
States to build the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, which required
[[new dev]{.mark}elopment[s in auto]{.mark}matic [detection]{.mark}
(Lajeunesse 2007; Naka and Ward 2000).[Within]{.mark} this new strategic
calculus, the [Arctic occup]{.mark}ied a pre-eminent [position]{.mark}
within what Matthew Farish (2010) calls [the '**cybernetic
continent**]{.mark}**'**. According to Farish, the [Arctic]{.mark} was
regarded as a frontier zone [populated by]{.mark} the intersection of
[**military and scientific interests** and]{.mark} [actors
supporting]{.mark} the '[**production** of]{.mark} a [cybernetic
continent']{.mark}, which was a '[task of projects]{.mark} that [drew
from **physics, strategy, and much else**,]{.mark} but did so at the
specific **[behest of Cold War imperatives']{.mark}**
(]{.underline}Farish 2010, 150). The [Arctic was conceived as one
strategic centre in a globalised world that served to amplify science
and technology as the primary solution to this strategic reality.
Notably, these [Cold War efforts demonstrate]{.mark} an important line
of consistency with contemporary strategic thinking in the [Arctic
as]{.mark} they rest on particular [sociotechnical imaginaries of
'**presumed emptiness'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Farish 2010, 179[) that
[underpin]{.mark} the [materialisation of sovereign **control** through
science and tech]{.mark}nology. **[Sensing]{.mark}** was [a critical
aspect of]{.mark} this [materialisation]{.mark} as technological
capabilities evolved on both sides of the Atlantic and was represented
by continental defence efforts, including the DEW line, and developments
in naval sensing technology supporting undersea surveillance apparatuses
to detect submarines]{.underline} (e.g. the Arctic Sound Surveillance
System project in the Greenland-IcelandUK (GIUK) gap and project
Spinnaker in Canada) (Dean, Lackenbauer, and Lajeunesse 2014, 9; Tamnes
and Holtsmark 2014, 28; Weir 2006). Following the end of the Cold War
and a brief lull in interest by Canada and other states after the 11
September 2001, terrorist attacks, the Canadian federal government
signalled its continued interest in Arctic defence research in the early
to mid-2000s. This phase began as Conservative Prime Minister Stephen
Harper routinely spoke of the Arctic as a core frontier of Canada's
national boundaries (Dodds 2011). Within the [political zeitgeist of
this time, the Arctic was (and at times continues to be) routinely
framed as a space ripe for **capitalist exploitation** and **interstate
conflict** over resources and transport routes in the near-to-distant
future. Such discourses have likened recent geopolitical interest in the
Arctic to the late 19th century's surge of colonial expansion in Africa
as European imperialism reached a crescendo (Borgerson 2008; Huggan
2015; Steinberg and Dodds 2015). While such comparisons have been
challenged as analytically ill-conceived for several reasons (see Claes
and Moe 2014), there are certain regional similarities in that both
Africa and the Arctic are represented through sets of overlapping and
often competing imaginaries that are historically contoured as **othered
spaces**.]{.underline} Importantly, in this era, [the issue of
'situational awareness' found a more emphatic connection to Arctic
security and governance.]{.underline} There is also a clear continuity
between the Harper era and current Arctic surveillance initiatives being
pursued by the Trudeau Liberals, for instance, through the recent All
[[Domain]{.mark} Situational [Awareness]{.mark} (ADSA) programme
(National Defence 2017a; National Defence 2018), particularly [as
tech]{.mark}nological [innovation]{.mark} relates to intelligence
products that contribute towards the visualisation and rationalisation
of]{.underline} Canada's [Arctic territory. Sensing practices are
designed to [illuminate]{.mark} the [Arctic using a range of]{.mark}
spectrum and sub-spectrum [imaging technique]{.mark}s, [which]{.mark}
are also productive in **[delineat]{.mark}ing** the [state's territorial
**boundaries**]{.mark} through these products. Within the logic of the
Arctic security imaginary, **[visualising]{.mark}** the [boundaries and
dynamic activities]{.mark} (including environmental patterns) is
critical to achieving all-domain awareness and defending against a
spectrum of future threats. With[in]{.mark} a [security lens]{.mark},
this [futurized imaginary is **defined** by]{.mark} overlapping
**[discourses and semiotic]{.mark}** layers [that produce]{.mark} the
[Arctic as]{.mark} a [space requiring securitised forms of
intervention]{.mark} and 'structure the conditions of possibility for
the management of future uncertain events, and the limits of potential
intervention in the alleviation of future threats and dangers' (Salter
2019, 4--5). The [Arctic's]{.mark} **natural, [unknown, and
empty]{.mark}** [qualities]{.mark} as the imagined North [lend
themselves to]{.mark} a [**securitised** understanding of
space]{.mark}]{.underline} by which the Canadian state must respond,
given that its de facto sovereignty is threatened (i.e. the state's
material control of the Arctic). [Security practices represent one form
of that response. They are performances of sovereignty similar to that
described by Wood-Donnelly, who argues that [states]{.mark} are
[materialised as political actors 'through]{.mark} the [**repetition**
of rules]{.mark}, or norms, [that]{.mark} the [**community of states
recognizes** as legitimate behaviour. To do this,]{.mark} they [borrow
from]{.mark} a toolkit of **[recognized symbols]{.mark}** ranging
[from]{.mark} the [spectacular to t]{.mark}he [mundane']{.mark} (such as
postage stamps) (Wood-Donnelly 2019, 13). Drawing on the
[symbols]{.mark} that [underpin]{.mark} the [imagined North]{.mark}
constitutes one (although not total) avenue of understanding the Arctic
and shapes the dominant forms of governance (including security
practices), which are likewise representative of the state's symbolic
and material authority across its territory. The sociotechnical
imaginary is, therefore, more than imaginative in a figurative sense;
[it **is a knowledge matrix**]{.mark} that [forms a system of meaning
that contours]{.mark} the [parameters of sovereign control]{.mark} and
intervention]{.underline} (Latham and Williams 2013, 13, 27).
[[Thus]{.mark}, while multiple [semiotic systems of
rep]{.mark}resentation [mobilise]{.mark} a core set of [symbols
towards]{.mark} different [imaginaries, not all imaginaries are
equal.]{.mark} Because [these rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark} are
[invested]{.mark} [with and through **relations of power**, imaginaries
**embody**]{.mark} that [power]{.mark}. With[in]{.mark} a [securitised
sociotechnical imaginary]{.mark}, [threats]{.mark} are
[constructed]{.mark} and mobilised [through]{.mark} core thematic
[drivers of rep]{.mark}resentation [and understanding]{.mark}, [where
space is]{.mark} rendered [in terms of **vulnerability**]{.mark}. In
turn, the [future is made insecure through]{.mark} specific [systems of
meaning]{.mark} that [directly condition t]{.mark}he [logic of sovereign
intervention]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Dual-Use Tech

#### Designating technologies as "dual use" is securitization.

Netherlands" https://doi.org/10.1080/14702436.2023.2277456

[The contemporary defence industry is made up of both civilian and
military companies]{.underline} that conduct research, development, and
improvement of technologies for use by military and similar agencies.
[The key trend]{.underline} in this sector [is integrated security
technologies]{.underline} that combine multiple layers of surveillance,
sensor data, and other relevant information to create an effective
system. [[Often,]{.underline}]{.mark} [these
[technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} [[have]{.mark} both [civilian and
military applications]{.mark}]{.underline} [and [are subject to export
controls]{.underline}]{.mark} due to their non-civilian nature. This
[[results in]{.mark} the [designation of]{.mark} the said [technologies
as "dual-use" which can be considered as]{.mark}
**[securitisation]{.mark}** of these technologies]{.underline}, as
argued by Ludovici (2021). This means that [[either technologies]{.mark}
[or the target destinations are constructed as **existential
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the relevant referent objects,
[thereby [removing]{.mark} the related [discussions from public
deliberation and addressing them with emergency]{.mark}-like
[measures]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contemporary analyses, significant
change of behaviour as a result of the securitising move is also
considered as a successful securitisation (Floyd 2016) and this approach
fits the topic of dual-use technologies very well.

#### By securitizing dual-use technologies, ministries expand traditional defense mandates into a globalized, techno-political domain that privileges institutional and industrial interests, ultimately eroding democratic scrutiny and depoliticizing vital debates about technological governance.

2.2. Current debates

Despite not being as prominent in the mainstream of International
Relations or security studies, literature on dual-use technologies has
been gradually expanding. The role of technology transfers including
spin-ins, spin-offs, and dual-use in defence innovation in Europe has
been previously discussed (i.e. Fiott 2017; Sezal and Giumelli 2022).
The main branches that deal with the issue can be classified as
knowledge/science governance and, as an extension of this, arms control.
Therefore the focus is particularly on nuclear, chemical, and biological
technologies that can be classified as dual-use. An emerging corpus also
deals with artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, cybersecurity, and
new surveillance technologies like facial recognition etc. Rychnovská
(2016) examines life sciences research and how it is regulated in the
United States based on the logic of "[[dual-use
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}." This dilemma [[indicates a situation
where]{.mark} easily [accessible knowledge]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nologies [can]{.mark} [be]{.mark} used for **[development
of weapons]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In her case this refers to the
[potential development of biological DEFENCE STUDIES **669 weapons and
acts of bioterrorism**. Therefore, the [dual-use dilemma]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} used as [an organising principle where]{.mark} an
[equilibrium]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [sought]{.mark} between, on one hand,
responsible research and innovation [and]{.mark}, on the other,
**[secrecy]{.mark} [and]{.mark} (national) [security]{.mark}**
(Rychnovská 2016).]{.underline} Ludovici (2021) sees this dilemma as
about deciding to securitise or not to securitise because
[[designating]{.mark} a [technology as dual-use]{.mark} "[allows]{.mark}
[an actor to]{.mark} **[construct]{.mark} [it]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a(n)
([existential) threat]{.mark}**, [even if]{.mark} the
[tec]{.mark}hnology [is]{.mark} developed [for civil
purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (258). 3. Securitisation and
desecuritisation Securitisation theory was first formulated by Ole Wæver
in 1995 and later on developed into a full theoretical framework with
the so-called Copenhagen School's perennial work Security: A New
Framework for Analysis in 1998 by Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver and Jaap de
Wilde. While the original premise is rather straightforward, the theory
has evolved significantly since its first inception.2 In this section I
will first introduce the basics of the Copenhagen School (CS), which
according to Balzacq (2011) constitutes the philosophical approach to
securitisation. Then I will explore the additions to the theory,
including the sociological approaches to the theory (Balzacq 2011).
Finally, I discuss the comparatively less studied dimension of the
theory, namely desecuritisation.

3.1. Copenhagen School

In mainstream/traditional studies, security has always been about
survival (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). [[When survival is put into
the equation **threats to survival become existential threats by
definition**]{.mark}**.** Therefore, for the [traditional state-centric
approaches]{.mark} security is about a state's survival, its exposure to
existential threats, or rather being invulnerable or resilient to these
existential threats.]{.underline} When the study is [[expanded]{.mark}
from the traditional military-political understanding of security, [it
includes]{.mark} other [areas]{.mark} [where]{.mark} the object who is
[threatened]{.mark} ("referent object") [can be different than the
traditional]{.mark} [one]{.mark} which is the state.]{.underline} The
term "securitisation" refers to [a location shift of issues from
political realm to security realm, the]{.underline} former meaning the
conventional arena of politics; the latter meaning the [extraordinary
realm [where]{.mark} the **[issues are no longer subject to political
discussion and there is an existential threat to a referent
object]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Therefore, "security" actually
is a practice where the meaning rests upon the way the concept is used.
It is argued that a successful "securitisation" has three steps, namely
the identification of existential threats, the call for emergency
action, and the effects emanating from removing the issues from the
regular political sphere. This seems somewhat self-explanatory, though
the question remains "how does securitisation occur?" The most
interesting aspect, as well as the most important contribution of
securitisation theory to security studies, is its description of how the
issues are securitised. The CS introduces the concept of "speech act,"
which it borrows from the linguistic theory and applies to international
relations.3 This is also the reason Balzacq (2011) classifies this
approach as "philosophical[." A "[speech ac]{.mark}t" within
securitisation is the discursive method of r[epresent]{.mark}ing
[issues]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [existential threats]{.mark} to a referent
object [by the actor]{.mark}]{.underline}. The referent object is the
main object [whose existence is threatened.]{.underline} In the military
sector, for example, it can be the state or the nation (i.e. in case of
an invasion), or 670 M. A. SEZAL national interests or national
identity. [The actor is the person or the entity (i.e. institution,
collective, etc.) which performs the "speech act" in order to securitise
the issue, and is called the "[securitising actor]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

However, the securitising actor cannot be anybody but it [needs]{.mark}
to be a(n) person(s)/entity(s) who has [a[uthority]{.mark} [so]{.mark}
that the "[securitising move]{.mark}" (the speech act) **[can be heard
and accepted by the relevant audience]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Buzan,
Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 33, 40). In Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde (1998)
"speech act" was conceptualised as not being securitisation itself, but
rather it was the "securitising move" which is done for the purpose of
securitisation. In this respect, to have a successful securitisation,
the "securitising move" should create a resonance in the audience. [So
in other words, securitisation is [not successful unless a **certain
degree of appreciation or consent or acceptance occurs in an audience by
the move**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Securitisation]{.mark}
[legitimises]{.mark} resort to [unconventional and]{.mark}/or
[extraordinary]{.mark} [measures]{.mark} to deal with the issue since
what is at stake is the pure existence of the object and anything needs
to be done to protect it.]{.underline} [Furthermore, [the move from the
political to the security sphere implies]{.mark} that [it can no longer
be challenged]{.mark} [and]{.mark} thus [every action is theoretically
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet again, for the CS, security is not a
desirable thing; [[on the contrary]{.mark}, [issues]{.mark} [should be
put back to the public/political sphere]{.mark}, and [this process is
conceptualised as desecuritisation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reason for
desecuritisation preference is that when something is securitised it
[legitimises the use of emergency measures and dismisses political
debate which potentially undermines liberal democracy]{.underline}. As
such, securitisation can be used as a means to achieve interests other
than those of the people, therefore "[[security]{.mark} [should be seen
as negative]{.mark}, as [a failure to deal with issues as normal
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 29). In
this article I argue that designating technologies as "[[dual-use" is
already a form of securitisation]{.underline}]{.mark} (that involves a
speech act and then acceptance of this act) and the export control
regimes can be considered as extraordinary measures. I will elaborate on
this in the analysis section through our empirical study. 3.2. Second
generation and beyond Despite being a product of the CS, the
securitisation theory has gained a momentum of its own outside the
immediate CS. Scholars such as Thierry Balzacq, Holger Stritzel, and to
certain extents Mark Salter and Paul Roe can be counted among the
"second generation" of securitisation theorists, the first generation
being the CS. Balzacq (2005, 2011, 2015) criticises the CS framework for
being fixed and permanent while arguing that emphasis must be given to
the nature of the audience, the context securitisation takes place in,
and the agency of the actors involved in the process. Additionally, he
proposes a methodological pluralism in the application of the
securitisation theory as he claims that sole dependence on discourse
analysis causes confirmation bias and therefore calls for incorporating
process-tracing to overcome this bias. Similar to Balzacq, Stritzel
(2007) also argues that the CS framework is limited, and he proposes
that it needs to be expanded with a layered approach that explores the
performative forces of texts (as theorised by Judith Butler), locates
the process within the already existing discourses and the power
relationships between the securitising actors. As a development of this
idea, he has revisited the securitisation theory with an emphasis on a
neo- and post-Marxist readings of discourse theory whereby
[securitisation becomes DEFENCE STUDIES 671 an amalgamation of
performative processes instead of a single speech act by an
authoritative securitising actor]{.underline} (Stritzel 2014). These
developments may seem natural, yet they indeed improve the theory
significantly and therefore allow for more comprehensive analyses that
this article also attempts to. As mentioned "audience" and its role in
securitisation have been discussed and rearticulated widely in the
critiques or revisitations of CS's understanding of securitisation. For
example, Stritzel (2007) and Salter (2008) questions how audience is
defined and understood, while Roe (2008) suggests [that both the
political elite and the general public can be the audience. More
recently, Floyd (2016) in her "revision" of securitisation theory has
defined the audience as the "addressee of the speech act"]{.underline}
(p. 688, emphasis in the original). Floyd's (2016) contribution is also
significant as it conceptualises the assessment of success/failure of
securitising moves. Instead of emphasising "emergency measures," she
suggests that [[securitisation is successful when]{.mark} a
[threat]{.mark} that requires response [is identified]{.mark},
[then]{.mark} the relevant [agent's behaviour changes]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} this change is [justified]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [reference
to]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} identified. Actors, specifically the
"securitising actors" are also central to the securitisation
theory.]{.underline} In essence, this refers to the actors that do the
speech act or the securitising move. Who these actors are is not always
as clear because depending on the issue/threat and the referent object
they could be a different entity/person. Nevertheless, most of the time
it is thought to be the governments and/or the parliaments are the key
securitising actors, especially when the concern is the security of the
state/nation (or similarly articulated political collective). In Buzan,
Wæver, and de Wilde (1998) political leaders, bureaucracies, lobbyists
and pressure groups are also listed as such; however, empirical analyses
seem to be limited in showing their actual influence as securitising
actors. CS is aware of the fact that it is very difficult to identify
the actors; however, in the case of national security "government is the
state" (40--41). This may well be the general case, but as Hansen and
Nissenbaum (2009) point out [[with reference to
cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}, sometimes there can be "[a powerful
[blending of private-economic and public-national security
concerns]{.mark}"]{.underline} (1161) which shows a complexity of
relations of relevant actors which is also in line with Stritzel (2014).
In this sense, we can think [of [securitisation]{.mark} in the
Balzacqian sense that it [is "a set of interrelated
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Balzacq 2011, 333) and as an extension
of this definition we can argue that there are multiple actors that in
fact negotiate what needs to be securitised or not securitised or
perhaps de-securitised. Furthermore, works within the framework of
international political sociology and insecuritisation approaches
provide a more Bourdieusian element to securitisation[.
I[nsecuritisation]{.mark} [refers to]{.mark} a Foucauldian "technique of
government" [where security technology and expert **knowledge form the
essence of modern society and social relations**]{.mark}**,**
[and]{.mark} the "[threat]{.mark} definition[s]{.mark}" [are]{.mark}
being [embedded in]{.mark} this [modern social relations]{.mark} (Van
Munster 2007]{.underline}). The essence of securitisation is that it
already highlights the insecurity of a referent object in the face of
keeping or achieving specific values. But here security is conceived in
ontological terms (there is even an explicit literature about
ontological security), whereas the CS treats security in its
epistemological quality: a securitising move such as a speech act
emphasising threat perceptions. Nevertheless, the process and
development of this technique are rather complex. Even though it emerged
during the Cold War, following the collapse of the USSR, the
disappearance of the common enemy and the so-called "triumph of
liberalism," agencies of that period 672 M. A. SEZAL and the
professionals have not disappeared. Since then, while "external"
security agencies such as the army have started to focus on the inside
of the borders to find enemies, "internal" security agencies like the
police forces have been looking for their "enemies" outside the borders
(Bigo 2000). In effect, two previously distinct spheres have converged
or even merged. Although it is widely claimed that the 11 September
attacks caused this change, it is argued that the reasons behind the
convergence are the structural evolutions of various distinct agencies
working in the area of security, and their relations with political
professionals were present long before (Bigo 2006). Similarly when we
talk about [[defence]{.mark}, even in its most limited version possible,
we [refer to this merger of internal and external]{.mark}. As such,
[defence has become something bigger and more
comprehensive]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Therefore, it is not an
exaggeration to refer to "security-defence" as a conjoined notion.
Despite the fact that the literature refers only to security, it indeed
implies the inclusion of defence since the meaning of defence has
already been expanded as can be seen from the previously quoted
introduction of the Dutch MoD. Security professionals and agencies
(whether internal or external) fight (within the agencies and without)
for their survival as well as dominance for practices of security. [This
leads to [insecuritisation **enabli**]{.mark}**ng [legitimation of
practices and interconnectedness between internal and
external]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Put differently, agencies and
professionals in the security field [[maintain their relevance and
ensure]{.mark} their [survival]{.mark} [through]{.mark} management and
[creation of insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}. While it is implied and
assumed that the field may include companies as private actors, the
literature does not engage with this aspect. In the realm of defence and
security, however, the role of the defence industry needs to be
explored. One way to understand securitisation of technology lies in
exploring the way industry as a whole and companies as individuals
behave (i.e. seeking securitisation or desecuritisation). 3.3.
Securitising technologies On the conceptual level defence refers to a
very specific action which is responding to armed aggression towards
one's own state. However, security may refer to a wider set of actions,
policies, discourses etc. even when a limited definition is considered.
Therefore, defence can be thought of as a subset of security because it
responds to a direct action. [Defence, then, refers to an emergency
condition that goes beyond securitisation which in principle is not
discursively constructed but factually present.]{.underline} Such
situations, as emergencies, cannot wait for public deliberation and
therefore require immediate response. However, as explained in the
introduction section of this article, [[MoDs and armed forces]{.mark} do
not fit into this conceptualisation anymore. Their [function is]{.mark}
much [more than defending]{.mark} the [homeland]{.mark}, and so the
concept of "security" becomes particularly relevant.]{.underline} In
contemporary Europe, almost all MoDs speak about "defence and security,"
although they are not ministries of security per se.4 Moreover, defence
industries or more concretely, companies operating therein also play an
important role in the defence ecosystems and the role of the MoDs (and
armed forces) in contemporary Europe. In this sense, dual-use
technologies present an interesting case as the concept itself already
shows a certain stance. A further investigation is required to
understand what exactly constitutes securitisation. One assumption is
that designation of dual-use technology is indeed securitisation because
after that moment said technology is considered applicable to nonDEFENCE
STUDIES 673 civilian means. [[Since]{.mark} considering that
[technologies]{.mark} [themselves]{.mark} [cannot]{.mark} [be
thought]{.mark} of [as defence or]{.mark} [civilian]{.mark} without a
social context, [**designating something as dual-use implies a level of
securitisation has already happene**d]{.mark}.]{.underline} However,
this can also be understood as desecuritisation because a technology
that is assumed to have only military-defence purposes can be classified
as dual-use and therefore becomes applicable to civilian
uses[.]{.underline} In such a case, the emphasis lies both in the
technology itself and the R&D process. Emerging technologies,
particularly the so-called "disruptive technologies" are usually
considered as dual-use from their inception. On one level, this is due
to the fact that new technologies based on digital and cyber are mostly
developed by civilian companies and by their nature they can be used in
both realms (Sezal and Giumelli 2022). Nevertheless, when we look at the
funding of the R&D process the situation becomes more complex especially
if public finances are involved. For example, security research
programme (SRP) within the EU's Framework Programmes was civilian in its
nature and therefore it was not allowed to fund defence and military
related technologies, but could fund dual-use technology R&D (Martins
and Ahmad, 2020). Furthermore, dual-use technologies are still highly
regulated on both the EU level and the member state level.
[Sociotechnical imaginaries are also at play when we think about
securitisation of technologies and understanding dual-use technologies
in this respect.]{.underline} Jasanoff and Kim's (2015)
conceptualisation of sociotechnical imaginaries attests to how certain
conceptions of future are embedded in the processes that lead to the
development of specific technologies. Very briefly, it means that there
is a conscious move to opt for a certain future (and in this case a
certain understanding of defence and security) which drives R&D but also
the [role of technology with respect to the social life and social order
(Jasanoff and Kim 2015; Martins and Mawdsley 2021). The [discourse
around dual-use tech]{.mark}nologies [and disruptive technologies
**points to**]{.mark} **a [specific socioscientific imaginar]{.mark}y**
whereby securitisation of technologies plays an important
part]{.underline}. As mentioned before, this securitisation process is
somewhat different from the classical understanding of the concept, but
is an extended version that is put forward by Floyd. Here it is
important to reiterate that this new understanding of security goes
beyond existential threats and focuses more on a significant change in
policy and/or regulation. [The idea is that [if]{.mark} a [technology's
trade is regulated]{.mark} it means that [there is a considerable and
unusual change in policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} As previously mentioned,
the general terms are regulated by the EU; however, member states still
can have additional measures. This opens up an area which can be studied
in depth. As such, we can understand how the process of securitisation,
in other words, additional regulations for the export regime of dual-use
technologies come into being. Here, we can look at which actors want
securitisation and which actors do not and the reasons. Based on this
theoretical background and the nature of the defence industry I
identified two actors and accordingly two sets of behaviour are
hypothesised: 1) Ministries of defence as the main actor to devise
policy and measures for "national security" would desire to
significantly limit or ban export of dual-use technologies as a
protective measure and are therefore pro securitisation. This desire
would be validated by an active participation in the governance of trade
regimes. 2) Companies operating in the defence sector would desire
lifting or at least easing of export controls to have a free access to
the market and are therefore pro desecuritisation/non-politicization.
This would be validated by opposing the measures openly through calls,
statements and lobbying.

### Economics

#### The aff's economic reinforcement is a guise for securitization.

Technological innovation, property rights, and American national
security

> [[Economic security is inherently tied to]{.mark} our
> [nat]{.mark}]{.underline}ional [[sec]{.underline}]{.mark}urity. As
> [[the foundations of our economy are]{.mark} becoming [increasingly
> rooted in digital tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies, [[the

[[The threat to economic security]{.underline}]{.mark}, and thus
national security, [[is not limited to the defence industrial
base]{.underline}]{.mark}. Cybersecurity is here a facet of American
economic security, with technological innovation considered in its
functional role across the US economy.

[[America]{.mark}n policy [describes threats to
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [innovation]{.underline} in classic
national security terms [[as a threat to the foundation of American
economic strength and]{.underline}]{.mark}, subsequently, its [[national
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. A series of National Security Strategy
([[NSS]{.mark}) [statements]{.mark} have [stressed that]{.mark} economic
[wealth is central to national power, American leadership, and]{.mark}
the future of [American global primacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 20[[10
NSS stated that]{.underline}]{.mark}, 'Simply put, [American [innovation
is the foundation of American Power]{.mark}]{.underline}' (White House
2010, np, 2, 28, 51), while the 20[[15 NSS noted that the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates s[[ought to
'advance]{.mark} a model of American [leadership rooted in]{.mark} the
foundation of America's [economic and tech]{.mark}nological
[strengths]{.mark}]{.underline} and the values of the American people'
(White House 2015a, 1, 21). A shift in tone occurs under the Trump
Administration towards more combative and pessimistic language, although
the underlying message is the same, as is the underlying policy (Wolfe
2018, 202). The 20[[17 NSS stated that 'Losing our innovation and
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[edge would have]{.mark}
far-reaching [negative implications for American prosperity and
power]{.mark}]{.underline}' (White House 2017, 21; OSTP 2019).
Contemporary [[socio-technical imaginaries of innovation in American
policy are not reflective of the]{.underline}]{.mark} short-term
drifting desires of policy experts (cf. Jepperson 2020, 52--53), but
rather articulate the long-standing [[idea that tech]{.mark}nological
[innovation is central to the]{.mark}]{.underline} competitiveness of
the [[American economy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Berman 2013, 417). [[Fears
about the erosion of US economic power]{.underline}]{.mark} through the
decline of its technological leadership centre primarily on the
vulnerability of intellectual property rights due to the insecurity of
digital networks (White House 2018a, 2, 16, passim; US Department of
Justice 2018, 65; White House 2013). China is identified as the single
most important source of threat to intellectual property rights -- and
thus technological innovation -- in American policy, as it has been for
nearly three decades. [US security concerns around innovation are
[intertwined with]{.mark}]{.underline} the broadest possible
[[geopolitical anxieties]{.underline}]{.mark} surrounding China's rise
and America's decline.

### Green Energy

#### Green energy discourse [isn't neutral]{.underline} --- dominant climate solutions mask ethical tensions and [alternative imaginaries]{.underline}.

**Benediktsson**, K. (20**21**). Conflicting imaginaries in the energy
transition? Nature and renewable energy in Iceland. *Moravian
Geographical Reports*, *29*(2), 88--100.
<https://doi.org/10.2478/mgr-2021-0008> //cwang

Renewable energy in Iceland is often seen as a spectacular success
story, and with some justification. The country's energy landscape is
the result of links between nature, scientists, technologies,
corporations, and myriad other actors. But even here the energy
transition is not completed, and questions remain about some aspects of
its seemingly smooth progress. [A distinctive [sociotechnical
imaginary]{.mark} is now in place, one which [forcefully
presents]{.mark} the continuing [expansion of energy]{.mark} production
[as]{.mark} a [moral obligation to provide]{.mark} the [world with
'green']{.mark}, carbon-free [energy.]{.mark} This is most strongly
expressed in the geothermal sector, a site of intense technoscientific
innovation]{.underline}. New experiments even present the possibility to
mitigate climate change by returning carbon back to the earth[. In
recent years, a [strong 'technological fix' approach]{.mark} has been
[evident.]{.mark}]{.underline} To be fair, some of the scientific
protagonists of this exciting technology have duly acknowledged its
limitations for tackling the scourge of global warming. Left mostly
undiscussed, however, is the [[lingering concern that]{.mark} the
[enthusiasm for 'engineering Earth]{.mark}' (cf. Brunn, 2010), [which
includes]{.mark} even grander ideas of '[climate engineering']{.mark} on
a planetary scale, [may not be]{.mark} the [wisest response]{.mark} of
mankind to this pressing problem]{.underline} (Hulme, 2014; Nightingale
et al., 2020). [A particular [nature imaginary]{.mark} has also emerged,
that [questions]{.mark} the very [premises]{.mark} upon which the recent
and ongoing expansion [of]{.mark} the [energy sector]{.mark}
rests.]{.underline} Here the affective potential of wild landscapes
assumes centre stage: the capacity of humans to be affected through
encounters with nature 'in the raw'. [[This
imaginary]{.mark}]{.underline} gains its expressive power from ideas
[[about moral obligations to present and future
gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} -- this time [about]{.mark} the immense
experiential [value of]{.mark} landscapes and [nature]{.mark} that is
left [without]{.mark} the marks of [technological
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. Added to this emphasis on wilderness
landscapes are [[serious misgivings about]{.mark} the [neoliberal
approach to managing]{.mark} natural [resources]{.mark} that is
[inherent in]{.mark} the [current energy regime]{.mark}. This [nature
imaginary]{.mark}]{.underline}, although not undisputed, [acts as a
[constraint on]{.mark} further [expansion of]{.mark} the [energy
sector.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Innovation

#### The aff's technological innovation [is the link]{.underline}\-\--It's [tied]{.underline} to American technonationalism and reproduces the [sociology of innovation]{.underline}.

Daniel **McCarthy 21**, (Daniel R. McCarthy, "Imagining the security of
innovation: technological innovation, national security, and the
American way of life), Critical Studies on Security, 9:3, 196-211, DOI:
10.1080/21624887.2021.1934640

In [[contemporary US nat]{.mark}ional [sec]{.mark}urity policy
[actualis]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [the [creativity and]{.mark} the
[entrepreneurial spirit]{.mark} of the American people is [understood as
**central to the American way of life**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Threats
to tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[innovation threaten]{.mark} the
very practices that comprise [America]{.mark}n['s **ways of**]{.mark}
**'[being]{.mark}** in the world']{.underline}. US imaginaries
articulate the processes and products of [[material culture]{.mark} as
[central to]{.mark} the [identity]{.mark} of the national
community]{.underline}. [[Securing market-led tech]{.mark}nological
[is]{.mark} thereby [understood as a **normative
project**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than merely the instrumental
pursuit of other values.

American politicians' sense of the United States as uniquely creative
and entrepreneurial is well captured in a 2016 speech by [[Barack
Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} (Obama 2016; White House 2015b, 65). Speaking
about the role of technological innovation in revitalising the city of
Pittsburgh, he [[stated]{.underline}]{.mark}

> And that's consistent with this nation, who we are -- a nation born
> from an idea that became the world's laboratory. There aren't a lot of
> countries where one of your Founding Fathers has an idea to fly a kite
> in a thunderstorm and helps to fundamentally change how we think about
> electricity. A place where the women who solved the equations to take
> us into space, even though they weren't always acknowledged. A nation
> whose engineers brought us the Internet. [[Innovation is in our
> DNA]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Here, [[pop]{.mark}ular [culture tropes and]{.mark} a mythic
presentation of [America's political development intermingle to produce
a]{.mark} powerful encapsulation of the [**dominant national identity**
constructed in US socio-technical imaginaries]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
reference to Benjamin Franklin's kite [[ties together innovation with
the foundation of the]{.mark} American [state]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
an image that, while possibly false -- the veracity of Franklin's kite
experiment to research electricity remains uncertain -- nevertheless
suggests that [[innovation is an **essential aspect of the national
character**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 'Who we are', in this context, is a
political community that finds its expression through a specific form of
scientific and technological innovation, an understanding present
throughout US policy in which [[market-led innovation allows the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to realise
its character]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Narratives of American political development support this]{.mark}
common-sense [sociology of innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
[contemporary US policy is linked to the historical founding of the
republic]{.underline}. Section 1, Article 8§8 of the United States
Constitution granted Congress the power 'To Promote the Progress of
Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and
Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
Discoveries' (Constitution of the United States 1788). American
officials highlight this clause as responsible for the subsequent
success of American capitalism and its track record of
[[tech]{.mark}nological [innovation]{.mark}]{.underline} (IPEC 2020,
2018; White House 2017, D. R. MCCARTHY 206 2015b). Collapsing two
different historical contexts separated by 230 years into a narrative of
the historical development of a national community, this idea of
simultaneity -- the identity [[of past and present]{.underline}]{.mark}
-- [[is of **signal importance in producing a techno-nationalist
identity**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Anderson 2006 \[1983\], 22--36).

#### America is underpinned by [security imaginaries]{.underline}, which seek to [control innovation]{.underline} and drive the roots of the American Way of Life deeper into society.

Conclusion

[[The process of creation]{.mark} as an expression of American national
identity [**sits at the heart** of US]{.mark} national [security
imaginaries of technological innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition to fears about the disruption of technological innovation and
its impact on geopolitical competition with China [[US imaginaries
articulate a vision of market-led, private]{.mark}-property based
[innovation as **central to the American way**]{.mark}**s [of
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The latter encompass ideas about the
nation, its values, and the material practices through which these are
brought into being. In this way, [[US socio-technical imaginaries
disclose a]{.mark} comprehensive [pre-theoretical world view of the
relationship between]{.mark} the [everyday lived experiences of
Americans and wider]{.mark} questions of
[geopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}. In these broader terms, [[US
socio-technical imaginaries are productive of American nat]{.mark}ional
[sec]{.mark}urity]{.underline} and foreign policies [[which seek to
**universalise its way of life** through the extension of its]{.mark}
preferred [form of technological innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
practices undertaken to meet these goals -- pursuing [[strong
i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntellectual [[p]{.underline}]{.mark}roperty
[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}ights [[protection at the
W]{.underline}]{.mark}orld [[T]{.underline}]{.mark}rade
[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}rganization, pursuing technological closure
around [[norms of appropriate Internet use]{.mark},]{.underline}
enacting [[trade tariffs against China]{.mark}, and so
forth]{.underline} (McCarthy 2015, 122--147; Jablonski and Powers 2015)
-- [[are oriented towards **reproducing**]{.mark} **the [power and
authority]{.mark}** of private sector actors]{.underline} domestically
and extending their reach globally.

[[The]{.mark} causal and normative [facets of US socio-technical
imaginaries]{.mark}]{.underline} of innovation [[frame the institutional
separations of American socio-technical orders]{.underline}]{.mark} --
between the political and the economic, between democracy and
technology, and between the public and private sector -- [[as **integral
to**]{.mark} the expression of **[the American
character]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In turn, [these [institutional
separations reproduce the authority of]{.mark}]{.underline} certain
segments of [[American society]{.underline}]{.mark} to design, develop,
and maintain its technological infrastructures, with the reproduction of
corporate power of particular note. [[Securing tech]{.mark}nological
[innovation]{.mark} thereby [reproduces **deeply rooted structures of
power** within America]{.mark}]{.underline}n society. Conceived in these
terms, innovation is designed to prevent social change, a conservative
rather than revolutionary process.

#### Instrumentalism is [unable]{.underline} to explain the relationship between [technological innovation]{.underline} and [IR]{.underline}\-\--sociotechnical imaginaries are [key]{.underline}.

Dynamics of [[technological innovation inform central narratives
of]{.mark} international systemic [change in IR]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Organski 1968; Brooks and Wohlforth 2015/16). Core disciplinary
accounts of the rise and fall of great powers, and thus [the [transition
from one international order to another]{.mark}, [are underpinned by
accounts of how technological innovations diffuse across the
International]{.mark}]{.underline}. More broadly, [[technological
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} and the wealth it is assumed to
[[produce]{.underline}]{.mark} is often equated with [[national
power]{.underline}]{.mark} as such (Mearsheimer 2001: 62; Taylor, M.Z.,
2004: 602). While most of [[this scholarship black boxes the political
economy of technological innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}, an important
subset of work on the political economy of weapons procurement has
detailed the impact of bureaucratic politics, pork-barrel politics and
electoral incentives, and defence contractor lobbying on levels of
defence expenditure and government support for private sector research
and development (e.g. Gholz and Sapolsky 2000). However, the primary
focus of this research has been on technological innovation in the
defence sector, rather than processes of technological innovation in the
wider economy. With some significant recent exceptions (Taylor, M.Z.,
2004, Taylor 2012, 2016; Kennedy and Lim 2018), [[detailed study
of]{.mark} the [broader politics]{.mark}]{.underline} and processes
[[of]{.mark} technological [innovation within
states]{.mark}]{.underline} -- as opposed to the dynamics of
technological diffusion between states -- [[has not been a central point
of]{.mark}]{.underline} focus for [[security
studies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Where processes of technological innovation have been analysed in
greater detail in IR, [[the dominant conceptualisation of innovation is
structured by an]{.underline}]{.mark} ideal-typical [[understanding of
what innovation should look like]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drawing on the
work of economic historians and rational choice theory, explanations for
the support for or resistance to innovation are located in the balance
between winners and losers in the process of change (Taylor 2012,
129--133). These are determined by the institutional configuration of a
given state -- the property regimes, electoral systems, research and
development bodies, and so forth -- which make innovation practices more
or less successful. [[Even in the most sophisticated accounts
of]{.underline}]{.mark} how [[technological
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} occurs (e.g. Taylor 2016), [[innovation
functions in the background as an ideal]{.underline}]{.mark} type whose
course is shaped, diverted, or blocked by the absence of specific
policies, and often by the presence of national cultural impediments
(Pfotenhauer and Jasanoff 2017, 786). Actors [[incentive
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether shaped by domestic political
interests or external security concerns (Taylor 2016), [[are the
determinant of whether or not a state will embrace
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is [[a 'deficit' model of
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which a norm of efficiency is
deployed to determine the [comparative]{.underline} efficacy of
different bundles of innovation policies (Pfotenhauer, Juhl, and Aarden
2019; Feenberg 2002, 6, 63, passim). The innovation model underpinning
these ideal-types prescribe [[what innovation should look like]{.mark}
as an end-point]{.underline} (Godin 2006); this condition [[has
never]{.mark} historically [existed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Technological
innovation is subsequently glossed as the instrumental pursuit of a
given outcome, and [the [motivations for pursuing innovation are]{.mark}
similarly [understood in instrumentalist terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. 1
Given both the lack of evidence on the efficacy of any given bundle of
innovation policies -- their impact on economic growth, and thus
national security, remains uncertain (Berman 2013, 400--401, 421;
Leitner 2017) -- **[[answering why states pursue specific forms of
innovation requires broadening our horizons beyond an instrumentalist
view]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Preemption

#### Their planning against probabilities encourages emergent thinking -- which is entangled with cybernetic informational technologies and the military enterprise

Emergence and profit

A rich body of literature points out that [[security governance today is
characterized by its **orientation toward
preemption**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly in the context of the
so-called war on terror (Amoore and De Goede, 2008a, 2008b; Anderson,
2010; Aradau and Van Munster, 2008; Massumi, 2007; Simon, 2012). A
preemptive security mode, according to these contributions, [addresses
itself to threats that are irregular, incalculable and in important ways
unpredictable]{.underline}. In her analysis of US neoliberalism and the
emergent possibilities of the life sciences and biotechnology, Melinda
Cooper (2008: 89) considers **[preemption to act [against a threat that
is 'emergent']{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[[that is]{.mark}, 'a threat
[whose]{.mark} actual [occurrence remains irreducibly
speculative]{.mark}, impossible to locate or predict']{.underline}**.
Cooper traces the notion of emergence in the work of microbiologist René
Dubos, who, she argues, was the first to coin the term as a way of
defining the temporality of biological evolution. According to Cooper,
Dubos, writing in the 1950s, dismissed the then dominant belief that the
evolution of life developed in linear ways and hence could be predicted
and controlled. Dubos claimed instead that microbial life evolved
continuously, unexpectedly and in complex alignment with human cells and
all other forms of life on earth. Decades later, Dubos' writings are
central to a new public health discourse that, as Cooper puts it,
'[defines infectious disease as emerging and emergent -- not
incidentally, but in essence']{.underline} (Cooper, 2008: 80, emphasis
in original). 'What public health policy needs to mobilize against', she
writes, 'is no longer the singular disease with its specific aetiology,
but [[emergence itself, whatever form it takes,]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[whenever and wherever it happens to
actualize']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Cooper, 2008: 80, emphasis in
original; see also Elbe et al., this issue).

For the purpose of this article, what is key is Cooper's argument that
the new discourse on emerging infectious disease has resonated with more
recent post-Cold War reformulations of US defence strategy. [Not only
has the [US]{.mark} military become [concerned with emerging]{.mark}
infectious disease as a [security threat]{.mark}, and begun to integrate
biological weapons into its defence arsenal, **[it has]{.mark} also
[come to define the]{.mark} global [threat environment as
emergent]{.mark} more [generally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This applies to
the new global terrorism in particular, which, it is argued, is no
longer confined to state boundaries, but [[uncertain, emergent and
potentially catastrophic by nature]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly,
others have analysed the close relation between
['life-as-emergence']{.mark} and transformations in thinking about
security and war (Anderson, 2011: 395; De Landa, 1991; Dillon, 2007;
Dillon and Reid, 2009; Martin, 2007; Massumi, 2009). Michael Dillon and
Julian Reid, in their analysis of the ways in which the 'liberal way of
rule and war' has come to evolve around life itself, observe how [[in
the wake of]{.mark} the confluence of the molecular and [digital
'revolutions']{.mark}, [life has become framed as information and as a
process that is emergent]{.mark}, complex and contingent.]{.underline}
These understandings have changed threat perception in fundamental ways.
Across multiple domains of life, Dillon and Reid write, 'molecular
processes of emergence ... become prime sites of insecurity'. Once their
life-like qualities are foregrounded, 'so is also their potential for
becoming-dangerous' (Dillon and Reid, 2009: 108, emphasis added).

[As life has been defined by [emergence, the force of becoming has also
become incorporated in security]{.mark} strategies and
practices.]{.underline} Dillon and Reid situate the [origins of]{.mark}
contemporary military strategic [discourse in the]{.mark} [growing
**[importance of information-based technologies and the development of
cybernetics]{.mark}** and new command-and-control systems during and
after World War II.]{.underline} In particular, they show how the
wartime work of Norbert Wiener, whose design of the anti-aircraft
predictor laid the foundations for the science of cybernetics, was
further developed in dialogue with bioevolutionary theorists working on
processes of complex emergence (see also De Landa, 1991: 43). What
Dillon and Reid consider the 'biologization' and
'[**[informationalization' of warfare has found its expression]{.mark}**
most prominently in the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) of the late
1990s]{.underline}. The RMA's significance does not simply lie in the
purchase of intelligent weapons systems. Rather, it entails 'a whole
scale re-engineering of military strategic discourse that in turn
embraced all the key concepts, while also adopting much of the same
biologized vocabulary, as that of the complexity as well as the
information and communication sciences' (Dillon and Reid, 2009: 114). In
this sense, [the [life sciences have come to function as]{.mark} a focal
point to which [reference]{.mark} is made [when military forces
recognize military bodies as adaptive, mutable bodies -- or
'swarms']{.mark} -- or [when they]{.mark} re[organize]{.mark} military
command [structures according to]{.mark} decentralized
['networks']{.mark}]{.underline} (Dillon, 2007: 13; see also De Landa,
1991).

Several commentators have interrogated how the figure of [emergence has
given rise]{.mark} not only [to]{.mark} new sources of [danger]{.mark},
but also to new [enterprises]{.mark} (Anderson, 2011; Braun, 2011). In
particular, theorists working at the intersection of insurance and
global security have begun to draw out the close relation between
emergence and profit (Ericson and Doyle, 2004; Martin, 2007; O'Malley,
2004). They point out that **[[insurers have come to recognize]{.mark}
and insist on [the]{.mark} commercial [value of indeterminable and
uncontrollable risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [What is common to the
insurance industry and other industries profiting from ambiguity is
their reliance on what Linsey McGoey calls a 'politics of
conditionality']{.underline} -- that is, the notion that economic
authorities thrive on their inability to predict or verify future
threats (McGoey, 2012: 8, following Massumi, 2007). In this context,
McGoey writes, **[[one can never really be wrong: if a predicted threat
materializes, authorities are credited for]{.mark} their
[foresight]{.mark}; [if an unpredicted threat materializes]{.mark},
[authorities]{.mark} can [call upon]{.mark} the [inability to
prevent]{.mark} low-probability [risk]{.mark}. More so, [if a predicted
threat fails to manifest]{.mark} itself, [this]{.mark} only [nurtures
the idea that the next crisis is near and that we need to become
prepared]{.mark}. Similarly, [when]{.mark} the [expectations surrounding
new technologies]{.mark} or markets [prove uncertain, this only
generates further investment]{.mark}, '[for]{.mark} more [hope and hype
are needed to remedy]{.mark} thwarted
[expectations']{.mark}]{.underline}** (McGoey 2012: 8; see also Sunder
Rajan, 2006).

Melinda Cooper analyses these developments in terms of the rise of [an
'[economy of emergence']{.underline}]{.mark} [that [relies on]{.mark}
the deployment of speculation and affective perceptions of [contingency
and unpredictability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Drawing on Christian Marazzi,
who discusses the venture-capital model of accumulation as an economy in
which 'everyday productivity is increasingly determined by the capacity
to respond in unforeseen and unforeseeable situations, emergent
situations', (Marazzi, 2008: 51, emphasis in original), Cooper argues
that [this is a model of economic growth in which **[production comes to
be contingent on]{.mark} the [inconsistencies]{.mark} of stock market
investment**]{.underline} (2008: 96). She discusses in detail how, in
the USA during the 1990s, investment in the life sciences and biotech
industries was generated on the prospect of economic growth following
the emergence of new information and communication technologies. But,
when the economy slowed in the early 2000s, the [pursuit of economic
[development]{.mark} [became]{.mark}, according to Cooper, [tied to
a]{.mark} new strategic [vision under]{.mark} President George W.
[Bush]{.mark}]{.underline}. Regarding the life sciences, there was again
investment, 'but this time on the pretext of permanent war rather than
permanent growth' (Cooper, 2008: 97; see also Marazzi, 2008: 151).
[[Both]{.mark} neoliberalism under President Bill [Clinton and]{.mark}
neoconservatism under [Bush]{.mark}, then, [mobilized
speculation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but]{.mark} [there is a]{.mark} key
[difference in the two subtexts of]{.mark} profitable
[emergence]{.mark}. Whereas during the 1990s [emergence spurred further
investment based on the widely held belief in the opportunities
associated with new information and communication
technologies]{.underline}, under Bush investment became linked to
preempting radical unknowns in the context of the global war on terror.
**[[What changed]{.mark}, then, '[is the affective valence of "our"
relation to the future]{.mark} -- [from euphoria, to panic]{.mark} to
fear, or rather alertness']{.underline}** (Cooper, 2008: 97).

Cooper's conceptualizations are [not just applicable to the US
context]{.underline}. [They offer a fruitful way to explore the
emergence of a new civil security market in Europe]{.underline}. First,
contemporary threat imaginaries that support market development
formulate that Europe has become exposed to 'global' security challenges
that are indeterminate and incalculable (Commission of the European
Communities, 2003, 2004; Council of the European Union, 2003).
[According to these narratives, [the end of the bipolar **order has
given way to**]{.mark} **a more 'fluid' threat environment with [new
types of threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including bio-threats) [that
ignore traditional state borders and target European interests both
inside and outside EU territory]{.underline} (Commission of the European
Communities, 2004: 6). In a world marked by potential disasters and
crisis, [security is supposed to remain open to new and unknown
connections and to become emergent itself.]{.underline} Concerning civil
markets, as we will see, this is translated into the aspiration to bring
together expertise from telecommunications, biotechnology, electronics,
and defence and aerospace, and to cut through traditional
civil--military distinctions.

Second, [**[the notion that threats could emerge from anywhere at any
time has been joined with the desire to integrate security and economic
profit]{.mark}** in a seamless manner]{.underline}. What we see in
Europe -- and what is being visualized in Figure 1 -- is a strongly held
belief in the opportunities associated with civil security, even though
it is recognized that, as of yet, market structures are immature and
fragmented, and market development overall is insecure. More so, the
uncertainties surrounding market development and the proclaimed
specificities of the civil market -- the problem that [**[the market is
event-driven]{.mark}** and largely dependent on public
demand]{.underline} -- have only contributed to further investment in
civil security. This is, then, [a market that relies on a double
speculative move, speculating on future threat scenarios and on future
production and profit.]{.underline}

Third, [analysing [the civil market as an economy of emergence]{.mark}
renders visible how [what is constituted as civil security]{.mark}
[draws on]{.mark} military strategies, rationalities and [technologies
of emergence]{.mark}.]{.underline} As discussed by Dillon and Reid,
Manuel de Landa and others, **[[contemporary military strategy is
closely connected to notions of life as
emergence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Military literature in the RMA has
expressed this most clearly, applying 'a blend of \[information and
communication technology\] thinking with complexity sciences to the
problematic ... of war' and promoting the exploitation of new
information and communication technologies (Dillon and Reid, 2009: 114).
The last section of this article explores how [civil concepts,
aspirations and [technologies draw on military responses to]{.mark} the
emergence of new [information-based technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Before turning to these developments, though, I first discuss the
co-emergence of civil security and the market in EU policy discourse in
recent years.

### Resource Extraction

#### Rhetorics of resource extraction paint the north as wild, vast, uninhabited, and untouched -- waiting for the federal government to develop it.

[[When discussing extraction]{.mark} of northern natural resources, the
[speeches drew on a specific rhetoric]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example,
[[policy announcements]{.mark} were [paired with descriptions]{.mark}
extractive northern natural resources [as]{.mark} [a holding place
for]{.mark} abundant/[vast extractive resources]{.mark};]{.underline}

From Iqaluit to Whitehorse to Alert, I have met some of the diverse
Canadians who are our true Northerners. They are the stewards of [[this
**largely untamed**]{.mark}, sometimes harsh and always
magnificent]{.underline} [**[land,]{.mark}** [**a vast storehouse of
energy** and mineral riches, a precious reservoir]{.mark} of ecological
and cultural]{.underline} [treasures.]{.underline} (Prime minister
announces the expansion of Nahanni National Park Reserve, 8 August 2007,
Fort Simpson, NWT)

Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this \[is\] the fourth August in a
row since becoming Prime Minister that I've travelled to the North. It's
because I want to send a strong signal to the rest of the country of the
growing influence of our northern frontier. With [[immense deposits of
valuable natural resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and a talented,
energetic, youthful population, the North's importance -- especially
now, in the midst of the worst global economic crisis since the Second
World War -- has never been greater. (Partnering to upgrade Yukon's Mayo

[[And of the northern landscape as large and
unknown]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These projects not only stimulate economic activity and boost employment
where it is needed today, they also provide local communities with the
infrastructure needed to prosper in the future. Here in Pangnirtung,
indeed [[across the vast expanse of our north]{.underline}]{.mark} it is
the future upon which we are focused. (Creating jobs and opportunities
for northern communities: Pangnirtung Small Craft Harbour 20, August

Now, ladies and gentlemen, the geo-mapping project is part of a larger
plan to [[map and chart Canada's]{.mark} [North,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to continue the bold tradition of exploration]{.mark} that has defined
our history, and to strengthen our understanding and our sovereignty
over a region that will define our future]{.underline}. (Prime Minister
Harper announces the Geo-mapping for Northern Energy and Minerals
Program, 26 August 2008, Ottawa, Ontario)

Finally, in the context of resource extraction, [the [northern
landscape]{.mark} was [also]{.mark} often [referred to as a]{.mark}
[resource frontier]{.mark}:]{.underline}

In the North today, there is an undeniable confluence of events taking
place: [as]{.mark} the polar ice pack recedes and the [global [demand
for]{.mark} energy and mineral [resources rises, the world is]{.mark}
indeed [beating a]{.mark} [path to Canada's Arctic
frontier]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Creating jobs and opportunities for

To summarise: [these [speeches]{.mark} and announcements [about]{.mark}
governmental policy about natural [resource]{.mark}
[extraction]{.mark}]{.underline} (as in line with the Northern
Strategy[) [framed the]{.mark} Canadian [north as a resource frontier
**-- a**]{.mark} **[vast, uninhabited area]{.mark},** rich in a treasure
trove of resources that are waiting to be discovered]{.underline} and
uncovered. [[The landscape]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[is unknown and

### Risk

#### Tech security is imagined, legitimized, and materially enforced through state-backed visions of risk.

[[The security imaginary is a]{.underline}]{.mark} social and material
[[**expression** of an insecure world and
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} the essential elements, [[**including
policy**, that]{.underline}]{.mark} partially [[make up that
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. A specific technology's relationship to the
social at the level of materiality is not pre-given, meaning that
technology results from a particular technological imperative produced
through specific meanings and practices (Davidshofer, Jeandesboz, and
Ragazzi 2017, 207; Müller 2015, 34). Within security considerations,
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[development is grounded in
specific social, political, economic, cultural, and other normative
ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} embedded within frameworks of understanding
linked to the state's interests and ways of being secure in the world.
In a more general sense, following influential accounts of imaginaries
by Said (Orientalism), Anderson (the Nation), and others, sociotechnical
imaginaries 'are collectively held, institutionally stabilized, and
publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared
understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable
through, and supportive of, advances in science and technology'
(Jasanoff 2015, 4). The sociotechnical imaginary occupies the
intellectual space between cultural production and representation and
material iteration through co-production. [[Coproduction indicates
the]{.underline}]{.mark} reciprocal and [[relational nature of
sociotechnical imaginaries]{.underline}]{.mark} as existing through the
mutually constitutive forces of semiotic representation and
material-technological articulation (Jasanoff 2015, 3; see Gregory 1995;
McCarthy 2021; Vonderau 2017). [[The concept]{.underline}]{.mark} of
sociotechnical imaginaries [[is helpful in analysing
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Canadian [[Arctic as a security
space]{.underline}]{.mark} in several respects. First, while [[classic
securitisation]{.underline}]{.mark} theory focuses on the discursive
construction of security in response to an existential threat, it [[is
traditionally limited in its dealing with]{.underline}]{.mark}
'\[c\]onstructions of [[danger that lie below the threshold of
existentialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the concept of risk'
(Methmann and Rother 2012, 325) in favour of an event focused view,
where securitisation is premised on a binary of before (non-security)
and after (security) (Huysmans 2011, 377). Further, securitisation may
be institutionalised such that '\[t\]he need for drama in establishing
securitization falls away because it is implicitly assumed that when we
talk of this issue, we are by definition in the area ofurgency' (Buzan
et al. 1998, 28). Within the Canadian Arctic, the issue of sovereignty
embodies the degree of institutionalization deemed necessary for
securitisation. Sovereignty CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY 189 exemplifies
a ready-made set of characteristics legitimising specific security
practices based on those taken-for-granted qualities, particularly the
idea that sovereignty is an inviolable right of all states. Within the
contemporary sociotechnical imaginary, [[the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Canadian [[Arctic is]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[**vulnerable**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} any one existential threat but rather [[a
multitude of risks]{.underline}.]{.mark} Hence, Canada is concerned with
technological solutions to defend Arctic sovereignty through sensing.
Here, the state is recognised as a critical political actor in defining
and providing security. However, the state is not the only security
actor, as literature on security governance demonstrates the role of
non-state actors (e.g. Krahmann 2005; Lea and Stenson 2007).
Nonetheless, the state retains an explicit security role, specifically
as that which legitimates the normative basis upon which sociotechnical
imaginaries are formed and deployed (e.g. through policy) and provides
the necessary material resources for those imaginaries to be acted upon
and materially realised. In sum, [[sociotechnical imaginaries provide a
robust framework]{.underline}]{.mark} to interrogate and destabilise the
technological solutionism [[that underlines instrumental and rationalist
notions of what technology is and can do]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially by the state, [**[in the name of
security]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

### Sensors

#### Tech is necessary for sovereign power.

**Johnson 24** \[Benjamin T. Johnson; Assistant Professor of Humane AI
intelligence and IR in the department of International Relations and
International Organizations (IRIO) at the University of Groningen,
Netherlands; Jan 21, 2024; \"This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical
imaginaries of security in the Canadian Arctic\";
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21624887.2024.2304413\]
Aaron

Pushing sovereignty outward, therefore, embodies both spatial and
temporal characteristics via technologically mediated practices of
surveillance and intelligence, which are combined to form techniques of
sensing[. [Sensing is a **crucial** state-led technique of sovereign
power for providing situational awareness (SA) that 'provides the
Government with the ability to perceive the physical (maritime, land,
air, and space) and non-physical (cyber and human) domains' while
'allow\[ing\] for the fusion]{.mark}]{.underline}, evaluation, and
dissemination of that information' to create 'intelligence' (Government
of Canada 2010, 30). In brief, sensing is acutely biopolitical in
categorising, filtering, and reassembling surveillance data from
multiple sensors and deploying that reorganised data as intelligence for
state action. Thus, [[technology]{.underline}]{.mark}-enabled [[sensing
is envisioned as a core feature of expanding and consolidating the
state's sovereign power in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Projecting
security through a risk framework socially creates the potential for a
much more comprehensive range and volume of threats in the form of
potentialities (Amoore 2013; Coker 2009).While Beck famously defines the
risk society as one that is socially 'preoccupied \[with\] the future'
(Beck 1992, 21), [[the increasing salience of risk as a framing
mechanism for security practices is a more recent]{.underline}]{.mark}
thematic turn and signals the influence of actuarial management and
insurance schematics on security (Lobo-Guerrero 2011). These frameworks
are specifically concerned with the unknown unknowns of the more distant
future, especially as the Arctic's melting ice may lead to challenges
for Canada's sovereignty and de facto control over its territorial
borders and adjacent waters (Grant 2016, 30; Lackenbauer 2011, 80).
[[Arctic security in the modern era is bound with
**futurity**]{.underline}]{.mark} because threats that undermine the
state's sovereignty are considered potentialities rather than clear and
present dangers. While the term 'threat' already implies what may happen
rather than what will, the nature of those threats as potentialities is
spatially and temporally expanded. [[The risks associated with threats
increase as threats are projected farther into the future, especially
concerning state sovereignty, which offers a sense of
immediacy]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Arctic's security in the present.
For instance, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper drew explicitly from
this Arctic imaginary by insisting that, in an often-cited passage,
Canadians in the 22nd -- century demand action in the 21st and that
Canada was at risk of 'losing' the Arctic if it did not 'use' it (Dodds
2012, 994).

### Tech

#### Science and technology were used as tools of conquest\-\--settler visions justified it as modern nation-building.

**Johnson 24** \[Benjamin T. Johnson; Assistant Professor of Humane AI
intelligence and IR in the department of International Relations and
International Organizations (IRIO) at the University of Groningen,
Netherlands; Jan 21, 2024; \"This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical

Aaron

[[Futurizing the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} as a social and political
imaginary [[is not]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely [[new, as
**colonialist**]{.underline}]{.mark} adventure and resource exploitation
**[[narratives have fuelled]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[settler
imagination]{.underline}]{.mark} since at least the late 19th and 20th
centuries. Security was not the core feature of the imaginary at this
time, but [[science and technology]{.underline}]{.mark} were and
[[continue to be critical narrative vectors]{.underline}]{.mark} of this
sociotechnical imaginary. Science and technology are understood to be
the tools of conquest and modernisation while deploying epistemic actors
(e.g. scientists) as voices of authority who (re)shape sociotechnical
imaginaries through that authority.For instance, [[science
was]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[positioned as a core trait of
modernisation]{.underline}]{.mark} and valued in its potential to
support northern expansionism for Canada's nationbuilding endeavours.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Canadian [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and
the [[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} people [[that inhabit it
were]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[portrayed as
**inferior**]{.underline}]{.mark} and southerners as civilising colonial
agents. A Globe and Mail article from 1937 illustrates this portrayal,
stating, 'Eskimos of the Arctic coast have benefited by invasion of the
white man' who 'taught Eskimos how to trap and have improved the Arctic
natives' standard of living' (Globe and Mail 1937). The Arctic was
imagined as an empty space, similar to the way that colonialism imagined
the 'New World' into existence. The colonial-future imaginary was
deployed more bluntly in another Globe and Mail article published in the
same year (1937b). As that piece argued, Millions of the white race some
day will find an invigorating home in the Far North, a scientist about
to embark on his fourth Arctic research trip predicted today\[. . .\]
The vast expanse of the Arctic can and will in the future be occupied by
millions of white people living in health and comfort. Likewise, the
Arctic was principally framed through this colonial imaginary towards
the end of World War II as the source of Canada's future wealth and
expansion as a nation; an Arctic Eldorado that was mischaracterised as a
'"frozen waste" \[and\] useless and conquerable' (Davies 1944, 79). As
Davies further argued, 'that the Arctic is difficult to win is granted.
But not impossible' (1944, 79). The [[reification
of]{.underline}]{.mark} science and [[technology for northward expansion
was]{.underline}]{.mark} especially [[apparent]{.underline}]{.mark}
during and the years after World War II as communications and aviation
technology improved dramatically and positioned Canada's Arctic
territory at the centre of a future global aviation regime linking
Toronto to the world's other major cities (see Globe and Mail 1937,
1943a, 1943b, 1944). As the Globe and Mail stated in 1944, "\[p\]lanes
flying from Chicago to Moscow would pass over \[the\] North Magnetic
Pole and \[the\] North Pole, while those bound for Bombay would cross
Northern Quebec" (Globe and Mail 1944). [[Technology as a product of and
tool in service of Arctic modernisation and nation-building
was]{.underline}]{.mark} routinely [[mobilised in the
media]{.underline}]{.mark}. As with other examples, [[the Globe and Mail
illustrated this]{.underline}]{.mark} tendency [[in an early commentary
on how **technology is 'opening up' the
Arctic**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

### Threat Construction

#### Futures can never be [absolutely certain]{.underline} so securitization is [always speculative]{.underline} -- [threats do not exist]{.underline} outside of the [imagination]{.underline}.

**Stockdale 18.** Liam P.D. Stockdale. "Imagined Futures and Exceptional
Presents: A Conceptual Critique of "Pre-Emptive Security."" Global
Change, Peace & Security, 2018. Accessed 26 July 2025. //s-tian

The [[logic of pre-emption]{.mark} as manifested in the **security
strategies** of the post-9/11 era [is]{.mark} thus [best understood as a
**political rationality** that allows action to be taken in the face
of]{.mark} apparent **radical [uncertainty]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Normatively speaking, it is premised upon mitigating the potentially
pernicious effects of that uncertainty by (re-)asserting control over
the unfolding of the future through anticipatory interventions in the
present. Yet [because [the future can never be **known
absolutely**,]{.mark} a certain '**objective uncertainty'** is at the
**core** of the logic of pre-emption.]{.underline}Footnote32 As a
result, the decisional rationality of pre-emption differs markedly from
other logics of political decision-making. Indeed, more conventional
logics such as rational calculation and cost--benefit analysis -- as
well as other, more temporally inflected security logics such as
deterrence and prevention -- all assume at least some degree of
certainty with respect to the substantive basis for action.Footnote33
This is not to imply that these decisional logics require complete
knowledge and/or total certainty; but rather that they are generally
premised upon inductive processes and rooted in the use of verifiable
knowledge to develop actionable assumptions with a certain degree of
empirically rooted confidence. This diverges importantly from the logic
of [[pre-emption]{.mark}, which [takes]{.mark} radical
[uncertainty]{.mark} precisely [as its **departure point,**]{.mark} as
the [**mere potential** of **future** danger provides]{.mark} the [basis
for **anticipatory intervention** in the
**present**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This location of radical uncertainty at the core of the logic of
pre-emption thus gives its decisional rationality a highly speculative
character. [[The **potential futures** against which pre-emptive
decisions are framed possess **no ontological presence** apart
from]{.mark} their **existence [in the realm of the
speculative]{.mark}**. It is therefore **not verifiable** empirical fact
that forms the **primary basis** of a pre-emptive decision, but
**conjectural articulations** of potential (and potentially dangerous)
futures]{.underline}.Footnote34 As Claudia Aradau and Rens van Munster
put it, 'what counts is a coherent scenario of catastrophic risk and an
imaginary description of the future'.Footnote35 Accordingly, [a
pre-emptive security decision is effectively **freed** from any
necessary **link to verifiable knowledge** or empirical
fact.]{.underline}Footnote36 Rather, decision-makers are encouraged 'to
take into account doubtful hypotheses and simple suspicions ... to take
the most far-fetched forecasts seriously', since the Cartesian
'malicious demon' of catastrophe might emerge at any time.Footnote37
[Through its 'appropriation of uncertainty as the basis for action'
**rather than an impediment** to action,]{.underline}Footnote38
[pre-emptive security thus creates a **political climate** in which
**decision-makers** are induced to '**break free** from the "tyranny" of
\[the\] **plausible'**]{.underline}.Footnote39 Indeed, the indefinite
future is precisely that which is being acted upon; and so any necessary
tie to empirical fact would too heavily constrain the scope of
decisional possibility, since no such 'facts' exist in relation to a
future that exists beyond the realm of the wholly knowable. The logic of
pre-emptive security thus resembles the so-called 'precautionary
principle' more familiar to theories of environmental governance, as the
evidentiary circumscriptions of the decisional process are diminished
considerably.Footnote40 Of course, pre-emptive decisions do not
necessarily constitute entirely arbitrary exercises in speculation --
although they can manifest as such. The point is rather that the role of
the speculative and the conjectural is significantly higher than is the
case under other political rationalities. In fact it must be, since the
logic of pre-emption seeks to act upon a future that necessarily remains
ultimately unknowable and thus 'beyond the horizon of
certainty'.Footnote41

This reliance on speculative and conjectural knowledge suggests that
there are significant political implications to adopting a pre-emptive
approach to (in)security governance. In particular, it implies that a
pre-emptive politics of security hinges on the exercise of the
imagination by relevant decision-makers, since this is the only way
politically actionable 'knowledge' about the ultimately unknowable
future can be generated. The next section explores the implications of
this point in greater detail, and specifically considers how such a
prioritization of the imagination suggests a crucial conceptual link
between the logic of pre-emptive security and the logic of political
exceptionalism.

[[At]{.mark} the [beginning]{.mark} of the 20th century [the country
was]{.mark} overwhelmingly [rural, relying on]{.mark} the [traditional
energy sources]{.mark} of a subsistence economy.]{.underline} With
economic changes and urbanisation as the century progressed, the need
for energy grew tremendously (see Fig. 2). At the very start of this
transformation, it seemed that imported fossil fuels -- coal and oil --
would prevail, but electricity soon won the technological contest.
Numerous mostly rather small hydropower stations were built. In the late
1960s, the first large one was constructed on one of the glacial rivers.
Its construction was linked to the building of the country's first
aluminium smelter (Skúlason and Hayter, 1998). [Further [development of
large-scale hydropower]{.mark} has
[followed]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} culminating in the Kárahnjúkar
dam and power station (690 MW), commissioned in 2007 (Karlsdóttir,
2010).

Geothermal utilisation has developed differently. In addition to
traditional localised use of geothermal water for bathing, it became
increasingly used for the heating of indoor spaces during the 20th
century (Pálmason, 2005).

[[Now]{.mark} about [90% of]{.mark} homes and other [buildings are
heated with geothermal water]{.mark}, the remainder mostly using
electricity from both hydropower and geothermal power stations for
heating]{.underline} (National Energy Authority, 2019). Electricity
production from geothermal sources is the most recent addition. [The
current energy mix [indicates]{.mark} the [vigorous development of
renewables]{.mark}: [fossil fuels]{.mark} now [account for less than 20%
of all]{.mark} primary [energy in Iceland]{.mark}, whereas
80--[85%]{.mark} comes [from renewable sources]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Fig. 3). Land transportation, aviation, fisheries and shipping remain
dependent on oil and thus linked into the global 'carbonscape'.

A new chapter in the history of geothermal energy commenced in the 1960s
with the building of a small power station in northeast Iceland. Some
years later, planning started for a much larger station close by.
Construction began, but nature intervened: in 1975 a spate of volcanic
eruptions started in the area, causing considerable delays (Ármannsson
et al., 1987). Eventually the station started producing, however.
Another geothermal station was successfully built in the 1970s in the
southwest, without any subterranean interventions. Knowledge relating to
things geothermal had started to accumulate, and Iceland's geoscientists
and engineers gradually gained a reputation for expertise in this
specialised field. In 1979 for example, Iceland's National Energy
Authority became the host for a Geothermal Training Programme for
trainees from developing countries, under the auspices of the United
Nations (GRÓ-GTP, n.d.).

[[In]{.mark} the [1990s]{.mark} the political direction of the Icelandic
[government changed]{.mark} firmly [towards
neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Benediktsson, 2014). [This [resulted
in]{.mark} a far-reaching [change in policies]{.mark} and visions
[pertaining to energy]{.mark} resources and their utilisation, not least
geothermal resources.]{.underline} Cheap electricity became a trump card
in the global game of national competitiveness. A new campaign was
started for aggressively marketing the country as a location for energy-
intensive industries (Gu�mundsdóttir et al., 2018). In itself this was
not entirely new, but the [[ideological change led to]{.mark} a much
more concerted effort and contributed to the formation of a [distinctive
sociotechnical imaginary]{.mark} that [centres on geothermal
energy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 1990 the public utility company operating the district heating system
of Reykjavík had gradually taken new high- temperature geothermal fields
into use for the growing city, supplying both hot water and electricity
from a new power station (Pálmason, 2005). This was a success. The
company started planning for a much larger geothermal station some
distance away, utilising the same geothermal field, albeit on the other
side of the volcanic massif (Gu�mundsdóttir et al., 2018). Another
energy company also started constructing a new station in the southwest.
[Although in public ownership and originally set up to provide vital
public services, both [companies]{.mark} had adopted aggressive market-
oriented strategies, eyeing good profitability with the [sell]{.mark}ing
of comparatively [cheap geothermal electricity, marketed as
'clean]{.mark} and green', to bulk users.]{.underline}

In the first decade of the 21st century, tremendous optimism was thus in
the air regarding Iceland's energy future in general, bolstered by grand
proclamations of industry proponents about the country becoming a
"Kuwait of the North" (Magnason, 2008, p. 198). Promoted by the power
companies and supported by political heavyweights and mainstream media,
it also became a part of the financial (mis)adventures that
characterised Iceland at the time (Benediktsson, 2014). The tone of a
newspaper editorial in 2006 provides a good example. The editor boldly
states: "Nowhere has geothermal energy been harnessed to greater extent
than in Iceland, and therefore no people have more ingenuity or better
technology than Icelanders for exploiting it" (Anon., 2006, p. 26). In
an interview a year later, the then- President of Iceland Ólafur Ragnar
Grímsson no less boldly stated his opinion that Icelanders had by then
"outstanding technical and commercial knowhow in this field, and there
is no other nation in the world that comes close, we are the absolute
leader nation" (Anon., 2007).

Impressive technological innovation, alleged financial acumen, and a
perception of almost limitless potential for growth thus became
components in a formative geothermal sociotechnical imaginary that often
has found expression in rather nationalistic rhetoric.

[[This imaginary]{.mark} has been further [strengthened with]{.mark} a
host of [innovative r]{.mark}esearch-[and-d]{.mark}evelopment
[projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. One is the Iceland Deep Drilling
Project. A large research project, still in progress, it is a joint
undertaking of public and private interests. In addition to the three
largest Icelandic energy companies, large international players have
joined the project, notably Statoil from Norway, the US National Science
Foundation, and the aluminium giant Alcoa(IDDP,2020).The project aims at
exploring whether it is possible to access geothermal fluids under
'supercritical' conditions at much greater depth than that of ordinary
geothermal wells, potentially giving access to energy at a scale
previously unknown in geothermal fields. The first well, in the
northeast of the country, was intended to reach a depth of 4.5 km, but
drilling abruptly came to a halt at a depth of only 2.1 km when magma
entered the borehole (Elders et al., 2014). The second IDDP borehole has
since been drilled in the southwest (see Fig. 1), reaching the depth of
4,659 m in early 2017 (Fri�leifsson et al., 2017), the temperature (427
°C) and pressure (340 bars) indicating that supercritical conditions had
indeed been reached. At the time of writing, this well was undergoing
flow testing.

that is, *environmental imaginaries*, a concept that carries forward the

[There is also a [temporal element to imaginaries]{.mark} that is

Imaginaries and their (in)stability connect in part to the core STS
theme of 'closure.' Closure and then stabilisation occur in technology
when a consensus emerges that problems arising in the development of
technology have been alleviated, and/or an agreement emerges concerning

Here we consider the extent to which closure and stabilisation have been
achieved in socially consensual terms and also with reference to the
general terms posed by [Jasanoff

Pre-emption and (in)security governance in the post-9/11 era

Footnote9'Everything is happening as though the future could no longer
be imagined except as the memory of a disaster which we only have a
foreboding of right now.'

-- Marc Augé Footnote10

A growing body of work has meticulously documented the emergence of
[[**pre-emption** as a prominent **security rationality**]{.mark} in the
[post-9/11]{.mark}]{.underline} era.Footnote11 While addressing a wide
range of practices -- including, but not limited to, [the indefinite
detention,Footnote12 extraordinary rendition,Footnote13 and **[targeted
killing]{.mark}**Footnote14 [of suspected terrorists]{.mark}; the
[widespread **biometric monitoring** of]{.mark} increasingly mobile
[populations]{.mark};Footnote15 the [pre-emptive detention of
refugees]{.mark} and asylum seekers;Footnote16 the [anticipatory
freezing of]{.mark} monies and [assets suspected of terrorist
ties]{.mark};Footnote17 [and the]{.mark} so-[called 'Bush Doctrine' of
**pre-emptive**]{.mark} **interstate
[war]{.mark}**Footnote18]{.underline} -- this burgeoning literature has
collectively highlighted the importance of temporally inflected,
future-oriented strategies in the global security climate. The following
discussion seeks to both tie together and build upon this literature\'s
insights, so as to move toward a comprehensive conceptual account of
pre-emptive security as it has (re-)emerged in the contemporary context.
I hope also to begin to demonstrate how [this emergent '[primacy of
pre-emption]{.mark}'Footnote19 [entails significant, and]{.mark}
potentially [**problematic, implications** for the way political **power
is exercised** with respect to]{.mark} questions of
(in)[security]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a point which will be considered
in greater detail in the next section.

To begin, it is useful to consider how and why the logic of pre-emption
has come to dominate the post-9/11 global security climate. The key
point here is that its rise has been largely coeval with the emergence
of transnational terrorism as the dominant issue. This is because [in
the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks,]{.underline} which the prevailing
narrative cast as an out-of-the blue evental irruption,Footnote20 [[the
**specific security problem** of terrorism became identified with the
**broader existential problem** of **temporal
uncertainty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.Footnote21 From the outset,
therefore, the post-9/11 governance of (in)security was effectively
'temporalized', as [the [terroristic event]{.mark} was framed as
**[ultimately 'unpredictable]{.mark}**]{.underline} in occurrence,
characteristics, and effects'.Footnote22 Importantly, such a
characterization rendered conventional security logics such as
deterrence or containment largely inapplicable in the context of
terrorism, since these are essentially ineffective in circumstances
where the threat in question is defined by its radical
incalculability.Footnote23 The global security environment thus became
increasingly framed in terms reminiscent of Ulrich Beck\'s 'risk
society' thesis,Footnote24 with established practical certainties and
techniques of control appearing to break down in the face of apparently
novel threats.Footnote25 [[Political authorities]{.mark} thus [became
'much less certain of **whether and when** they \[were\] secure, and
**how**]{.mark} -- and **to what extent and at what price** -- [security
\[could\] be **achieved'**]{.mark}]{.underline},Footnote26 and terms
such as 'extreme uncertainty',Footnote27 'radical
contingency',Footnote28 and other such expressions of perniciously
excessive ambiguity came to pervade accounts of the global security
environment. However, [it is in precisely such a context that the logic
of pre-emption proves compelling, since it explicitly delineates a
programme for action that actively confronts uncertainty by ostensibly
enabling decision-makers 'to **counter the unknowable before** it is
even realized']{.underline}.Footnote29 Since the spectre of terrorism in
particular appears to require precisely such a capability if it is to be
governed,Footnote30 [the proliferation of pre-emptive strategies,
mechanisms, and **technologies of security** has been a central feature
of the post-9/11 global security climate -- to the extent that one
commentator has aptly referred to the latter [as a '**state of
pre-emption'**]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote31

#### Oversecuritization justifies [State violence]{.underline} -- Mohamed Hersi proves.

**Stockdale 18.** Liam P.D. Stockdale. "Imagined Futures and Exceptional
Presents: A Conceptual Critique of "Pre-Emptive Security."" Global
Change, Peace & Security, 2018. Accessed 26 July 2025. //s-tian

To better clarify these points through an illustrative example, consider
the recent case of [[Mohamed Hersi]{.mark} -- a 25-year-old
Somali-Canadian man who [was arrested by]{.mark} the **Royal Canadian
Mounted Police** ([RCMP]{.mark})]{.underline} at Toronto\'s Pearson
International Airport on 29 March 2011.Footnote57 [In what was described
in the media as a 'new kind of **terrorist case'**, Hersi was detained
prior to boarding a flight bound for Cairo via London and was ultimately
[charged with]{.mark} the **newly created offence** of '[attempting to
participate in a terrorist activity']{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote58
[[Despite maintaining]{.mark} that [he merely planned to study Arabic in
Cairo for four months]{.mark}, the [RCMP alleged]{.mark} that [Hersi
intended to]{.mark} proceed to Somalia [to train as a militant with the
Al-Shabaab]{.mark} network]{.underline} -- a group classified as a
'terrorist organization' under Canadian law. [Yet in a strikingly
**candid admission**, [the RCMP]{.mark} readily [acknowledged]{.mark}
that [there was]{.mark} very **[little concrete evidence]{.mark}** that
Hersi did, in fact, plan to train with Al-Shabaab as
**speculated**]{.underline}.Footnote59 [[This highlights]{.mark} the
[**explicitly pre-emptive** nature of the arrest]{.mark}, since [the
decision]{.mark} to act [was]{.mark} nevertheless [made in the face
of]{.mark} the **[empirical knowledge deficit]{.mark}** that
characterizes anticipatory action]{.underline}. Moreover, [the [RCMP
also admitted]{.mark} that [its investigation 'did not indicate]{.mark}
that [the suspect was a]{.mark} direct **[threat]{.mark}** to his
country or Canadians' [at the moment]{.mark} of his
arrest]{.underline}.Footnote60 In other words, [[the threat]{.mark}
posed by Hersi that was **pre-empted** by his arrest **[did not
exist]{.mark}** at the moment he was detained.]{.underline} Indeed, not
only was the evidence primarily conjectural, but Hersi himself was
several degrees removed from actually posing an imminent terrorist
threat. [[The basis for his arrest amounted to]{.mark} a series of
**[highly speculative assertions]{.mark}** [relating to a **potential
future** that may or may not]{.mark} have [actually]{.mark} come to
[pass]{.mark}. That his arrest took place at all therefore suggests that
[the RCMP made the decision]{.mark} to act [based]{.mark} primarily
[upon]{.mark} the exercise of **[the
imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Butler\'s formulation of
'deeming' thus provides a good analogue for this case, as Hersi was
'deemed dangerous' enough to be pre-emptively arrested, despite the fact
that he had committed no terrorist act at the time of his arrest, and it
was openly admitted by the authorities that he posed no immediate threat
to the Canadian state.

[Mohamed Hersi was thus arrested on the basis of an **imagined future
threat** that he **may have one day posed** had he ultimately succeeded
in acting upon what he was suspected of planning to do]{.underline}. The
case therefore illustrates both of the key points discussed so far in
this section -- namely, that a pre-emptive security strategy requires
that decisions be made through the exercise of the imagination, and that
this accordingly vests within the relevant state authorities an enhanced
degree of discretionary subjectivity. With respect to the first, the
lack of verifiable evidence of guilt did not prevent the RCMP from
acting, suggesting that it relied upon the imagination to construct a
potential future against which Hersi\'s pre-emptive arrest could be
framed in the present. With respect to the second, the fact that the
RCMP could legitimately act upon such a speculative epistemic foundation
shows how a mandate to pre-emptively govern terrorism significantly
enhances the decisional discretion afforded to state security
authorities. This latter point is especially important for understanding
the broader political implications of adopting a pre-emptive security
strategy. In particular, the enhanced discretionary subjectivity granted
to state decision-makers by a reliance upon the imagination suggests an
innate conceptual link between the logic of pre-emptive security and the
logic of political exceptionalism. In other words, it implies that
pre-emptive security operates through a paradigm of political power
resembling that which obtains in the so-called 'state of exception'.

### Tech

#### Tech rivalry goes nuclear

Furthermore, [[technological rivalry will become a pivotal
battleground]{.underline}]{.mark} in the broader geopolitical contest
within the Arctic. The distinct natural and geopolitical characteristics
of the Arctic render technological advancements critical in determining
leadership within this strategic region. Whichever nation secures the
technological upper hand will gain a significant advantage in the
Arctic's strategic landscape.

The U.S. 2024 [[Arctic Strategy emphasizes achieving its strategic
objectives through a "monitor-and-respond"
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}. This strategy encompasses a broad
spectrum of technological and information technology innovations. For
instance, the 2024 Arctic Strategy highlights the need to improve domain
and situational awareness in the Arctic, enhance investments in early
warning systems and aerial defense sensors, and bolster capabilities to
detect and identify potential threats. In addition, [[the strategy
underscores the role of technology in supporting military operations,
ensuring that military infrastructure and equipment remain functional
under extreme environmental conditions.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Similarly, Russia is intensifying its efforts. *The Foundations of the
Russian Federation State Policy in the Arctic for the Period up to
2035* outlines key technological goals, including the development of
critical technologies essential for Arctic advancement, addressing
defense and societal security needs, and creating materials and
technologies suited for Arctic conditions
\[[74](https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-025-00250-y#ref-CR74)\].
Notably, Russia's expertise in constructing nuclear-powered icebreakers
positions it at an advantage in sustaining a robust Arctic presence.

In sum, [[technological competition]{.underline}]{.mark} [between the
two principal geopolitical blocs---led by the U.S. and its Western
allies on one side, and Russia on the other]{.underline}---[[will
escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally, the ["remilitarization" of
Arctic governance may extend its impact beyond the region]{.underline}.
For instance, in Europe[, NATO members face heightened risks of becoming
entangled in strategic conflicts with Russia]{.underline}. In Asia[,
Japan and South Korea are being pressured to side with NATO, thereby
abandoning their Arctic cooperation with Russia]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[China's Arctic collaboration with Russia will also experience
heightened external pressures.]{.underline}

#### Reject the aff's [technocratic imaginary]{.underline} to center place-based cultural ways of knowing like 'pungsu' that [resist ecological control]{.underline} and [honor land's spiritual meaning.]{.underline}

Importantly, [while [affects]{.mark} are [produced by individual]{.mark}
sensory engagements, they are [also]{.mark} "saturated with [collective
knowledge]{.mark} and values]{.underline}" (Petersen, 2018, p. 7). [The
[nature imaginary]{.mark} may therefore be [understood a]{.mark}s a
collective, more-than-human construction -- or
[co-construction]{.mark}]{.underline}. When it comes to renewable energy
projects, the form that construction takes is by no means a foregone
conclusion, but the specific outcome of the affects of nature and their
cultural collective processing.

[An intriguing recent example from [So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea (Kim,
Chung and Seo, 2018) well [illustrates]{.mark} the [complexity and
cultural depth of nature imaginaries]{.mark}]{.underline}, although the
authors do not use the term themselves[. [In]{.mark} this
[technologically advanced country]{.mark}, the age-old East Asian
tradition of ['pungsu']{.mark} (fengshui) is still very much alive.
'Pungsu' [centres on]{.mark} the mapping and manipulation of
'[qi']{.mark}, the vital [energy]{.mark} thought to [affect human
life]{.mark}]{.underline} in many aspects. [[Sites where wind]{.mark}
conditions [are favourable for]{.mark} the location of wind [turbines
are]{.mark} considered [inauspicious in 'pungsu' terms]{.mark}. The
erection of such [turbines]{.mark} is [resisted and likened]{.mark} in
fact [to]{.mark} the attempt of the Japanese occupational forces to
[thwart]{.mark} the [flow of 'qi' by driving iron stakes into
mountains]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus [[breaking the spirit of the
people]{.mark}. One could interpret this as a very particular nature
imaginary, based on ancient traditional beliefs for sure, but influenced
by historically recent events, and deeply concerned about the
future.]{.underline}

In other geographical settings, nature imaginaries will take different
forms. For example, mainland [[European]{.mark} cultures generally
operate with a conception of landscape that [acknowledge]{.mark}s the
[cultural imprint of land use on nature through
history]{.mark}.]{.underline} This may have [[eased]{.mark} the [recent
remaking of ag]{.mark}ricultural landscapes in Northern Germany [into
wind energy]{.mark} landscapes]{.underline} (Krauss, 2010), and can be
seen as [involving a particular nature imaginary.]{.underline}

[Such [constructs]{.mark} can thus [matter greatly when it comes
to]{.mark} the deployment of [renewable energy.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Through them, [human- nonhuman relations are crafted: imagining the
future is]{.mark} a [performative]{.mark} act.]{.underline} Crucially,
nonhuman agency, through various affects of the diverse things that
comprise nature, is an integral participant in the act of imagining
these relations. In the remainder of the article, I will explore the
analytical value of this approach with a discussion of the Icelandic
energy transition, and of the formation and ongoing contest of different
imaginaries in this particular context.

### Reject

#### Reject the aff to [undermine]{.underline} logics of [technological determinism]{.underline} and [technonationalist securitization]{.underline}.

Contributions from Science and Technology Studies (STS), historians of
technology, and increasingly from IR, have stressed that [[social,
political, and historical contexts are **central to**]{.mark} **both
[the]{.mark} generic [embrace of innovation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} to
the [specific form that innovation assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nowotny
2006; Nye 2003; Schmid and Huang 2017; Pfotenhauer and Juhl 2017).
[[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[innovation is not]{.mark} merely
[valued due to]{.mark} its ability to deliver [material
prosperity]{.mark}]{.underline} (although we should not underplay this),
[[but]{.mark} also [as an **expression of**]{.mark} **a specific set of
[cultural values]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The **pull of
technonationalism**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- understood as the national
prestige political communities attach to technological innovation rather
than as a synonym for autarky (Edgerton 2007; cf. Bitzinger 2015;
Kennedy 2013) -- is a prominent example. [[States pursue]{.mark}
specific [defence industrial policies]{.mark}, and innovation policies
more broadly, [because they **reinforce valued
identities**]{.mark}]{.underline} and international esteem registered by
technological achievements (Adas 1989; Ritchie 2019). [[Examining the
pursuit of tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[innovation requires
**moving beyond a sole focus on security**]{.mark} competition [and
econ]{.mark}omic [growth to consider]{.mark} the [larger frames]{.mark}
of meaning actors attach to innovation]{.underline}, particularly given
that political actors clearly do not conceive of technological
innovation in strictly instrumentalist terms.

Undertaking [[this analysis requires that we understand]{.mark} the
[world-views that]{.mark} make sense of and [support]{.mark} distinct
[institutional orders of tech]{.mark}nological
[innovation]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the political processes through
which specific [[social actors]{.underline}]{.mark} are empowered to
make design decisions, [[wield]{.mark}ing [political authority in the
**materialisation of dominant socio-economic
norms**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As noted, recent work in security studies
and International Relations has made important moves in this direction,
[[unpacking]{.mark} how]{.underline}, for example, [[border
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [are creating in the laboratory prior
to their employment [in the material creation of
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bourne, Johnson and Lisle 2015; Lisle
2018). [[Tracing out networks of association]{.mark} in this manner
**[undercuts]{.mark} ideas of [technological
determinism]{.mark}**]{.underline} and sociological determinism.
Furthermore, for critical security studies this insight is of crucial
importance in pushing beyond the reduction of technoscientific practices
into the category of instrumental rationality. [[Analysing security
practices]{.mark} in the laboratory thereby **[highlights]{.mark} both
[the misrepresentation of technoscientific
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline} and provides direct empirical evidence
of the political struggles intrinsic to innovation

### 2AC---FW---Arctic Education Good

#### [Policy education]{.underline} is key to Arctic understanding and solving [real-world issues]{.underline} --- [engagement]{.underline} through debate fills critical public knowledge gaps.

Elizabeth **Leane &** Katie **Marx** (20**25**) Public engagement with
the polar regions: an introduction, The Polar Journal, 15:1, 1-9, DOI:

[[One task]{.mark}, therefore, [is]{.mark} simply to [distinguish the
regions in]{.mark} the [minds of those who have no special
connection]{.mark} with them]{.underline}. This may be harder than
anticipated: [[national]{.mark}ly representative [surveys]{.mark}
conducted in the US and Australia [show]{.mark} that [no more than
half]{.mark} of respondents of these countries [are confident
about]{.mark} the [basic geography of the North
Pole]{.mark}]{.underline} (water covered by sea ice); the South Pole
fairs a little better, but [[40%]{.mark} of Australian, and more
Americans, are still [unsure whether or not the region is characterised
by ice covering land]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 While focussing on such
fact-based figures might seem pedantic, [these [results correlate
with]{.mark} a [similar confusion in]{.mark} relation to [important
issues, such as]{.mark} the [most significant]{.mark} future [sources of
sea-level rise]{.mark} (less than half of respondents of both nations
identified land ice in Greenland and Antarctica as the correct answer in
a multiple-choice question]{.underline}12). Conflation of and confusion
between the two polar regions, then, is one source of misinformation,
and a reason why considering public engagement in a polar context, as
well as separate Arctic and Antarctic contexts, is meaningful. The next
question is what distinguishes these regions from other geographical or
topical categories. One answer has already been touched on:
[[for]{.mark} the vast [majority of humanity,]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctica are [remote place]{.mark}s most likely to
[encountered in]{.mark} a [mediated way]{.mark}: through [reports,
narratives, images]{.mark}]{.underline} (still and moving) [and [sounds
produced]{.mark} or recorded [by others. Their]{.mark} relative
[inaccessibility]{.mark} arguably [increases]{.mark} the [importance of
public engagement]{.mark} for these regions: [in]{.mark} the [absence of
direct experience]{.mark} of polar environments, wildlife and human
communities, [engagement with others' responses is]{.mark} the [only
way]{.mark} in which most [people can learn about]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic]{.underline}. [The [room for
misunderstanding is significant]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the results of
the national surveys mentioned above suggests

A 2018 study demonstrated the [[**connection** between]{.mark}
meaningful [participatory processes and public support for projects
in]{.mark} Northern [Canada and]{.mark} Northern
[Sweden]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 The [researchers found that
[support]{.mark} for mining projects [correlated with]{.mark} their
[**confidence** in]{.mark} the [decision-make]{.mark}rs and the location
of decision-making]{.underline}.14 [Those]{.mark} [who [believed]{.mark}
that [local actors had influence]{.mark} over the projects [were]{.mark}
**more [supportive]{.mark}** [while those]{.mark} who [believed that
local]{.mark} or indigenous [actors should]{.mark} [have more influence

While [history]{.mark} has [shown]{.mark} that [it is]{.mark} [certainly

the [**absence** of]{.mark} any genuine [dialogue with local]{.mark}

effective [fourth estate, a]{.mark} lively n[on-governmental sector,

[responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. No-one in the Arctic-- from the
corporate sector, to the government representatives, to the hundreds of
citizens with whom our contributors engaged in the course of their
research for this book-- expressed support for a"resource-curse" economy
combining highly pro table (for some) extractive projects with high
levels of oppression. [That no one took such an extreme position is
unsurprising, but there was a wide [consensus that]{.mark} [**extractive
industries** could not come at the cost of]{.mark} social cohesion or
personal [well-being and that]{.mark} [top-down decision-making]{.mark}
in some abstract"national interest" [is not acceptable]{.mark}. However,
[community support]{.mark} for and community bene t from extractive

[**communication** between all parties.]{.mark} Conversely, [poor

#### Three reasons for polar engagement

Collectively, these papers highlight [[three important points
for]{.mark} future scholarship relating to [polar public
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[first]{.mark} of these
[point]{.mark}s relates to [the **interaction** between]{.mark} the
[local and]{.mark} the [global]{.mark}.]{.underline} Through their
[[studies in South Africa and Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}
respectively, Eeden-Wharton et al. and Hunt et al. [[demonstrate]{.mark}
the [important role that]{.mark} qualitative [research plays in
establishing a]{.mark} rich [understanding of the]{.mark} political and
cultural [contexts that shape]{.mark} public **[attitudes]{.mark}**
towards]{.underline} Antarctica in different parts of the world. [A [key
**challenge**]{.mark} **for policymakers**, practitioners, and
researchers [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[how to develop p]{.mark}olar
[p]{.mark}ublic [e]{.mark}ngagement [strategies]{.mark} that can be
employed globally [while]{.mark} [accounting for]{.mark} and valuing
[**local differences**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Scholars]{.mark} working
[on p]{.mark}olar [p]{.mark}ublic [e]{.mark}ngagement [might]{.mark}
[consider how]{.mark} they might collaborate [to **standardise**]{.mark}
methodological [approaches]{.mark} and research questions [to
ensure]{.mark} that [locally focused studies can be compared]{.mark}
with one another [to achieve a **global
understanding**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 'Polar Literacy Principles'
mentioned earlier provide a start, but more work needs to be done
testing these and similar forms of coordination.

[The [second]{.mark} key [point]{.mark} relates to
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[emerging importance of **tourism**]{.mark}
as a vector [for p]{.mark}olar [p]{.mark}ublic
[e]{.mark}ngagement]{.underline}. As Hardy et al., Cusick et al., and
Steins all show, [[polar tourists are]{.mark} simultaneously [an]{.mark}
[audience to be engaged and]{.mark} a [group of]{.mark} potential
[engagement **practitioners**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is [worth
asking]{.mark}, therefore, [[how we can]{.mark} best [equip tourists
with]{.mark} the [skills]{.mark} and knowledge [to share]{.mark}
Antarctica [with]{.mark} their friends, family, and
**[communities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Finally, the diversity of approaches employed within each of these
papers demonstrates that, [within polar research, [public
engagement]{.mark} as a topic [attracts interest]{.mark} and
participation [from across]{.mark} the disciplinary
**[spectrum]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There are, however, a [[series
o]{.mark}f specific **[methodologies]{.mark}** and skillsets,
[located]{.mark} primarily with[in]{.mark} the humanities and **[social
sciences]{.mark}**, that are [necessary to help]{.mark} us [evaluate
public engagement initiatives and understand]{.mark} how [people think,
feel, and act in relation to the polar]{.mark} regions]{.underline}. One
important question for future research, therefore, is to [how we as a
sector can support interdisciplinary collaborations while also
platforming the disciplines and skillsets that specifically relate to
engagement.]{.underline}

With the 2032--33 International Polar Year fast approaching, there is
[[**no time to lose** in addressing]{.mark} this [need for public
engagement]{.mark} research [to inform effective
practice]{.mark}]{.underline}. We hope that this special issue will be a
launching pad for these efforts.

### 2AC---FW---Arctic Clash Good

#### Structured debate is [true engagement]{.underline} --- only [reciprocal clash]{.underline} avoids the one-way [deficit model]{.underline} and creates real public engagement. 

Elizabeth **Leane &** Katie **Marx** (20**25**) Public engagement with
the polar regions: an introduction, The Polar Journal, 15:1, 1-9, DOI:
10.1080/2154896X.2025.2492481 //cwang

'Public engagement' is a term readily evoked but less easily defined and
understood. This term and its cognates have been increasingly referenced
in polar forums in recent years, particularly in relation to climate
change.1 It would be difficult to mount an argument against the [[need
for more]{.mark} and better [public engagement with]{.mark} the [polar
regions]{.mark}]{.underline}. But what does public engagement mean, what
does it look like in action, and what, if anything, makes its
application to the polar regions distinctive? Both parts of the
deceptively simple phrase 'public engagement' can be -- and often are --
dissected and contested. Who is 'the public'? Scholars and practitioners
have long decried the tendency of specialists to lump anyone who is not
a fellow specialist into this grab-bag -- a category which implies a
singular, homogenous entity.2 While researchers still use the singular
noun 'public' or even 'general public' for convenience, most accept that
the concept is better understood in its adjectival form; in the plural,
as diverse publics; and/or as a spectrum that covers a wide range of
non-specialist positions and demographics. 'Engagement', in turn, is
often used loosely and interchangeably with a series of other terms,
including 'popularization', 'awareness', 'participation', 'literacy',
'communication', 'education', 'outreach', or a combination of these.
[[In]{.mark} a [polar context]{.mark}, the last International Polar Year
(IPY) tended to [favour]{.mark} the acronym EOC -- [Education, Outreach
and Communication]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have chosen
['[Engagement]{.mark}']{.underline} advisedly, primarily because of its
[[connotation of]{.mark} an [active, two-way]{.mark} [relationship,
rather than]{.mark} a [passive transfer of info]{.mark}rmation [from
specialist to 'public' -- as]{.mark} in [the]{.mark} much [critiqued
'deficit model' of]{.mark} science [communication]{.mark}]{.underline}.4

### 2AC---Turn---Arctic Securitization Good

#### Securitizing our present and future is key to empower exploration of successful alternative futures -- Kivalina proves.

"Security" Talk. 2015. *Dreamscapes of Modernity.* Accessed 25 July

In the following, I focus on two cases that have been demarcated as
security issues. The first relates to the small Inuit community of
Kivalina, Alaska, which is experiencing severe erosion to the point that
the villagers need to be relocated. The second focuses on food
insecurity in Alaska and Canada. In both security cases the Inuit enter
into a productive reflection on the relationship between "contemporary
self" and "future self" (as "other"), and in doing so carve out a space
for newness. Climate Change Insecurity: Kivalina [The [small Inuit
community of Kivalina, Alaska, is facing]{.mark} coastal
[erosion]{.mark} **so [severe]{.mark}** that its inhabitants have been
asking for relocation since 1910]{.underline}.12 Storms are eating their
way into the coast, and with each bite the waves take the village is
undermined.13 The increase in storms and the lack of protective ice are
understood as linked to changes in climate.14 These changes have left
the village more exposed and vulnerable. According to Kivalina's
attorney, "the village is being wiped out by global warming and needs to
move urgently before it is destroyed and the residents become global
warming refugees."15 Furthermore, the changes in weather and ice have
had an impact on subsistence activities and have made some forms of
hunting more difficult.16 [[**Imaginaries** of a **future of
uncertainty** are dominant]{.mark}, and the [inhabitants express little
hope]{.mark}.]{.underline} Kivalina Tribal Administrator Colleen Swan17
expressed the people's frustration and concern in this way: "[[Where
will we go, and who will help us move]{.mark}?"]{.underline} Kivalina is
struggling to attract the attention of the authorities and make them
understand the tremendous risks they are facing. The villagers, who have
been called "America's first climate change refugees," fear for their
safety and security.18 The US Department of Homeland Security has been
engaged in emergency plans for the community. A number of technical
solutions have also been applied temporarily by the military to protect
it, and possible new locations for it have been explored. Seen from
Kivalina, [the [erosion risk is an **immediate security issue** for the
community]{.mark}. The [inhabitants are being **forced to imagine** and
scale themselves into a totally **other future
position**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The translation and negotiation
processes that I want to draw attention to are taking place not only
between the community and the authorities, and among persons and
families within the community, but also at an individual level,
resulting in extreme personal distress and ambivalence. Each person has
to establish and explore new narratives of being Kivalinamiut -- those
who see their identity as linked to Kivalina. Thinking about relocation
can be viewed as a process of translation where those involved know that
something personal and collective is being lost and that something new
will emerge. Several relocation sites have been investigated,19 with the
site evaluations formulated largely in technical terms. The discussions
centre on community and personal welfare, possibilities, and protection.
The villagers have to translate technical language into future scenarios
and evaluate the conditions for social and personal reproduction in a
new site. Several referendums have been conducted so that community
members can choose from different locations.20 Many sites have been
considered undesirable because they are too far from the coast, which
would disrupt subsistence activities and make supply delivery
difficult.21 In the relocation discussions, questions related to the
process of cultural translation arise: If the community is relocated to
another place, is it then the same community? And if not, what are the
consequences for social reproduction? These are more than "questions";
they also amount to long chains of painful translations of personhood
and community. The uncertain future, lack of foreseeable relocation,
housing shortage, loss of traditional cultural knowledge, and poor
living conditions,22 "combined with feeling\[s\] of hopelessness could
greatly contribute to social problems in the village."23 To boost the
imaginary power of Kivalina's residents in this process of translation,
the organization Re-Locate (a collective of ethnographic artists and
transdisciplinary partners) received funding "to further integrate arts
and culture into the field of community planning and development.
Re-Locate will work to co-create a village-based territorial planning
process with individuals, families, and institutions in Kivalina that
makes visible and brings action to their strategies and plans for
relocation and for a world where particular subjectivities and cultural
practices can endure and flourish."24 [[This co-creation process]{.mark}
can be seen [as an act of **cultural translation**]{.mark} where
[**ideas for the future** are given **space to grow**. It]{.mark} is a
process that [will **help**]{.mark} the [residents "visualize where
we're at, **where we can be**, and **how we can move** in that
direction,"]{.mark}]{.underline} as formulated by Millie Hawley,
president of Kivalina's IRA Council established pursuant to the
provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act.25 According to Colleen
Swan, [the process does more than **boost the co-creation** of future
imaginaries; [such projects]{.mark} also "[**empower the people** to
make]{.mark} the **[decisions]{.mark}**."]{.underline}26 [[The
**security situation** has thus **fostered creative community action**
to **confront** the "**future bad"** and]{.mark} has [encouraged the
exploration of **alternative future** selves as part of the
**conscious** pursuit of **fate control**. This **affirms**]{.mark} and
underscores the importance of [self-determination]{.mark} as an
Indigenous community]{.underline}.

#### Security thinking -- no matter bad or good -- is a prerequisite to self awareness and moral agency. 

**Sejersen 15** Frank Sejersen. 12 The Transformative Power of
"Security" Talk. 2015. *Dreamscapes of Modernity.* Accessed 25 July
2025. //s-tian

The New Arctic Since the end of the Cold War, [environmental and climate
change issues have been pivotal to the public's perception of the
Arctic. That region is no longer viewed as a cold, marginal,
military-strategic place; it is now seen as an open maritime space of
global importance to our understanding of climate change
dynamics.]{.underline} The Arctic is now viewed as a place of extreme
physical and ecosystemic transformation, those changes having been set
in motion by rising temperatures, among other factors, with severe
consequences for the Arctic's inhabitants. [A new landscape of risk and
opportunity has been produced.]{.underline} Additionally, political
changes with respect to the recognition of Indigenous peoples' rights
have positioned these peoples as strong collective rights-holders.
Various governments, treaties, land claims, and other political
structures have led to Indigenous peoples' increased self-determination
and changed the political modus operandi. The international cooperation
that has developed under the auspices of the Arctic Council reminds us
that rights-holders and stakeholders have been provided with new
political arenas and tools to address and influence regional dynamics.2
[This landscape of risk and opportunity and these various partnerships,
governments, and multi-level cooperative projects together comprise the
"New Arctic."]{.underline} To Think with "Security" [[Security
thinking]{.mark} is a particular kind of **cultural and political** act
that [makes it possible to]{.mark} **transcend** place and time while
reproducing and **[reflect]{.mark}ing** [on **existing ideas** of what
constitutes stability]{.mark} and responsibility. [Security
thinking]{.mark} thus triggers a particular space-time and [**demarcates
a space for agency**, fear, hope, and promise]{.mark}. I argue that [a
security issue can be understood as a **productive act** of]{.mark}
establishing a space for [**renegotiating** causalities, subject
positions, morality, and dominant ways of scaling]{.mark}]{.underline}
(and is thus a little bit more than a reflection on a "referent object"
and "agent of security," which are often referred to in security
studies). [[Security]{.mark} is a powerful concept as it [calls for
**moral action**]{.mark} and can place **human existence** at the
**forefront** in particular ways]{.underline}. This perspective, which I
suggest here, is based on a post-structuralist approach to security and
is inspired by the Copenhagen School of security studies.3 Whereas the
Copenhagen School focuses on the complexities of the securitization
process, and thus primarily points to how security issues arise, I want
to turn our attention to the [productive potential of these
securitization processes. When we approach "security talk," "security
thinking," and "security issues" as a **transformative space**, we may
see not only different understandings of who/what is in need of being
secured, from what threats, by what actors, and through what means, but
also whom we become when secured.]{.underline} I see "security talk" not
only as a conservative obsession with maintaining and protecting what is
treasured from a perceived threat, but also as a productive and creative
act of imagining and negotiating who we are and who we want to become.
Security talk is thus also about the "future social." Basically,
[security talk can be seen as an act of future-making.]{.underline}4
[This task of imagining the "future social" can be approached as a
sociocultural action, where communities (at all scales) and individuals
caught in fluid landscapes of (real or imagined) risks and threats
mobilize new understandings of "community" and "personhood]{.underline}"
-- feared, anticipated, or desired. They may pursue what Homi Bhabha
calls a "cultural translation,"5 which he perceives as a process whereby
people are compelled to revise their own reference systems, norms, and
judgments when faced with other systems of significance. I propose to
view the constructed images of the "future social" as an "other system
of significance." [[When communities are attentive toward other futures
-- **bad or good** --]{.mark} people creatively try to establish a
vision, to anticipate a storyline or a line of future development.
[Security thinking]{.mark} is thus able to [evoke **creative
agency**]{.mark} that brings the unprecedented into effect by way of
**imaginative power**, [thereby expanding]{.mark} the [community's
**awareness of itself**.]{.mark} The transformative potentialities of
security discussions can thus be conceptualized as an act of cultural
translation where something is lost and something is gained. So when
people engage in security talk they are not only lost in translation as
they struggle to understand the times to come -- they are also
creatively producing something new. I thus see the translation as an
activity inherent in any situation that relates to a security issue in
which people have to imagine a "future bad." The idea of a "future bad"
forces people to **confront themselves** with their own "future self" as
"other," so to speak -- one could see it as a "**cultural encounter**"
with an imagined future self. The analysis of the construction of the
"dangerous other" is often an inherent aspect of the study of security
discourses.]{.underline}6 Moreover, the processes of "othering" that I
address are linked to how one's future self (as other) is negotiated,
constructed, and imagined, as well as the productive aspects this
entails[. Images of "future bad" and [questions of security and risk
create a transformative space where people **rethink and
rescale**]{.mark} constituent [parts of society and
**identities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is this process that can be
approached as cultural translation. I am not talking about cultural
translation as a process taking place between closed and bounded systems
where different perceptions of risk, threats, and security meet and are
to be grasped through translation and negotiation (e.g., between local
and state perspectives and concerns). I see cultural translation as a
creative act of cultural production taking place in a carved-out
transformative space where there is high attentiveness to the negotiated
ideas of self and other.7 Security thinking can be approached as an act
of cultural translation where neither the original nor the translation
are fixed and enduring categories because they do not have an essential
quality, and both are constantly transformed in space and time.8 In
cultural translation neither "start" nor "target" is stable or entirely
separate. Despite this uneasy but productive relationship between self
and other, original and translation, start and target, the concept of
cultural translation points our attention toward the high alertness of
border-crossing in space-time and concerns about what such
border-crossings may entail with respect to what is lost and what is
gained. For Homi Bhabha, cultural translation is an attentiveness to
hybridity. Walter Benjamin even argues that translation gives the
"original" (which he sees as open, living, and unfixed) an afterlife or
a prolonged life (Fortleben).9 But Fortleben is, according to Bhabha,
the essence of survival (in French sur-vivre). Bhabha applies Benjamin's
ideas to his understanding of cultural translation in the following way:
"If hybridity is heresy, then to blaspheme is to dream. To dream not of
the past or present, nor the continuous present; it is not the nostalgic
dream of tradition, not the Utopian dream of modern progress; it is the
dream of translation as 'survival,' as Jacques Derrida translates the
'time' of Benjamin's concept of the after-life of translation, as
sur-vivre, the act of living on borderlines."10 This state of dynamic
self-translation is essential in "security talk," where the "future bad"
emerges as a border to apprehend and deal with[.]{.underline} What are
the implications of seeing things as I propose here? If we, for example,
look at climate-related security issues we quickly end up in the study
of impacts, vulnerability, and resilience. I suggest, however, that [it
may also be productive to redirect our focus away from the usual
question of "How do we deal with the risks?" toward the question of
"Whom are we to become when dealing with the risks?"]{.underline}11 The
point of departure is that the question "Whom are we to become[?" is
tantamount to thinking of communities on another scale and to creating
new images of social life.]{.underline} And if we ask this question, [I
think it has an impact on the knowledge regime we have established
around security studies.]{.underline}

https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-021-00176-1)

[Two **contrasting** **sociotechnical imaginaries**]{.underline} [were
elaborated in the foregoing paper]{.underline}. In [the first scenario,
we considered a security-oriented society that is quick to embrace
"technological fixes.]{.underline}" In [the second scenario, by way of
contrast, we examined a somewhat more traditionalist society that is
skeptical of technology and more tolerant of risk]{.underline}.

The dynamic factors that we identified at the outset of the paper are
characterized by a certain degree of ambivalence. Specifically, our
dynamic factors have the potential to drive future developments, yet are
also dependent themselves on specific developments[. Our findings
indicate that **regulatory decisions** in combination with
**international norms and standards** will play an important role in
shaping future developments with regard to an increasing or decreasing
use of security technologies]{.underline}. At the same time,
[**concrete** **developments "on the ground**" that are enabled by
technical advancements **are likely to be an important influencing
factor**]{.underline}. To provide one example, the adoption of proactive
surveillance technologies by the police, once firmly established, could
become difficult to reverse.

In this way, [the future that ultimately manifests **will be the
crucially conditioned by the decisions taken by legislators and the
courts**]{.underline}. At the same time, [the concrete technological
possibilities that are realized at any given time will play an important
mediating role]{.underline}. [These mutually independent key factors
will set the stage for future developments]{.underline}. In this way,
[any **effort to bring about a desired set of future relationships in
the domain of security** must necessarily devoted **special attention
to** the political culture that we collectively foster and the **legal
regulations** that emerge therefrom]{.underline}. Such considerations,
in turn, highlight the difficulty at arriving at a firm definition of a
"secure future". Security cannot be assessed on a one-dimensional
continuum; we cannot say conclusively that the "To Be Ahead" scenario is
the more "secure" one[. The definition of "security" is naturally
subject to a process of political negotiation, as vividly demonstrated
by our contrasting projections of future developments.]{.underline} Our
scenarios illustrate the practical implications of security technologies
for the populace while also casting light on their intended and
unintended consequences.

The [presented scenarios are **particularly valuable with a view to the
divergent alternative futures t**hey present]{.underline}. By
definition, both futures cannot occur simultaneously. In this way, [they
**illuminate alternative paths** on which we might embark, **herein
resides their true value**]{.underline}. By [distilling relevant
developmental factors and **projecting them forward** within the scope
of internally **coherent**, tangible **narratives**, we provide a
**foundation for further deliberation**]{.underline}. Indeed[, for
knowledge to be successfully disseminated and invested with practical
value, it is necessary to encourage its adoption on the part of
addressees]{.underline}. In this context, "[knowledge transfer" refers
to the communication of research findings to an audience such as policy
makers]{.underline}. However[, the process of transfer cannot directly
be observed, as it tends to take place in an unstructured
manner.]{.underline} In addition, [the acceptance and dissemination of
knowledge is influenced by various factors]{.underline}, and the
knowledge transferred is often not applied in a direct manner \[14\].
[Effective science communication informs about the consequences of
decisions, including the associated risks, costs, and
benefits.]{.underline} Accordingly, [it aims to furnish a shared basis
of understanding, and thus enable recipients make informed
decisions]{.underline} \[12[\]. **Scenarios**---such as those presented
in this paper---are a means of **supporting this goal**]{.underline}.

In this way, our paper aims to [provide a concrete, empirically basis
for discussions regarding our future; our **scenarios are also
illustrative**, as they furnish practical points of reference for the
consideration of possible policy strategies]{.underline}. By acting as a
"policy entrepreneur" and [using "policy windows", one can arrange
talks, discussions, and workshops with decision makers]{.underline}.
These [deliberations should concentrate on the key factors identified in
this study---that is, on the factors that are highly relevant in the
scenario process]{.underline}. A focus should lie on dynamic key factors
and driving factors (Quadrant I and II, Fig. 2), because the key factors
have strong reciprocal relationships, and the driving factors in
particular operate as a "lever" or catalyst for future developments.
Focusing on these issues can help to avoid getting sidetracked in less
relevant discussions[. It is our aim that the presented **scenarios**
will **serve as a springboard** for broader public discussion regarding
various aspects of **security technology**, for---as our scenarios
indicate---such technologies have the potential to exert major impacts
on the domains of politics, society, and the economy.]{.underline}

Methodical reflections

In developing the scenarios[, we sought to ensure that our imagined
futures satisfied numerous quality criteria.]{.underline} Specifically,
[we aimed to ensure they were plausible, consistent, understandable,
traceable, distinctive, integrated, triangulated, and theoretically
grounded]{.underline} (cf. \[13, 16, 30, 31, 36\]). We have ensured that
[our scenarios are internally coherent]{.underline} by conducting impact
assessments and associated consistency analysis. [Our scenarios
represent divergent development paths, which makes them clearly
distinctive]{.underline}. Our overall research process was disclosed at
the outset and can thus be traced at every step. We, the authors, worked
in unison to complete each step. Individual methodological sections were
at first undertaken separately, in order to identify similarities and
points of contrast. Nevertheless, we allow that [an alternatively
composed research team could potentially arrive at scenarios with
different features]{.underline}. The data compiled in our literature
review could have permitted the elaboration of more than two scenarios.
However, this would have complicated a clear delineation between the
scenarios.

**[Our scenarios should be understood as a tool for enabling
communication]{.underline}**. Specifically, [the narratives sequences
and their content seek to **facilitate to "meaning
making**"]{.underline} \[8\]. While the [scenarios we have described
intend to enable negotiative processes, a scenario development approach
can never be suitable for arriving at a final or conclusive assessment
of a subject matter]{.underline}. In this way, [far from seeking to
adopt a specific polemic tact, we aim instead with this paper to
**provide impetus to debates about our collective future**]{.underline}.

### 2AC---Perm Do Both---Tech Decolonization

#### Perm do both---top down approaches compliment bottom-up movements 

**Cruz 21**, Assistant Professor at Mauá Technological Institute
(Cristiano Codeiro Cruz, 2021, Decolonizing Philosophy of Technology:
Learning from Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approaches to Decolonial Technical
Design, Philosophy & Technology, 34, p. 1861)

As seen, decoloniality stands for overcoming the coloniality of being,
knowledge, and doing. [In the **realm of technology and technical**
**design**, **decoloniality** **can be promoted** or tried by at least
**two different** general **approaches**]{.underline}. One [of them
starts from philosophy and concepts down to technology and
design]{.underline} **[(top-down]{.underline}**). [The other learns with
marginalized or grassroots people and contributes to these people's
emancipation or decolonization, building theorizations out of these
processes]{.underline} (**[bottom-up]{.underline}**).

Decoloniality presupposes the empowerment or emancipation of the "most"
colonized too, say, the 50% that face the harshest life conditions or
social segregation/ stigmatization. That is why [top-down approaches may
fall short in their achievements, for they may not go much further than
allowing the elites]{.underline} (e.g., philosophers, engineers,
architects, and designers) [to conceive and construct sociotechnical
orders good for them but not necessarily for the 50%.]{.underline} The
pluriversal order that decoloniality seeks cannot be constructed for the
(most) oppressed. It has to be constructed with them.

**[However]{.underline}**, [**top-down decolonization can help** at
least part of those involved in bottom- up technical
designs]{.underline} (e.g., engineers, architects, programmers, and
social scientists) to [improve it.]{.underline} In this sense, **[it can
be said that such approaches are or can be complementary]{.underline}**.
How such complementarity can be constructed is highlighted later. In the
remainder of this chapter, ontologic, epistemic, and political
consequences will be drawn from this dialog with bottom-up and top-down
approaches to decolonizing technology and technical design and rendering
them decolonial, i.e., making them capable of fostering decoloniality.
That is meant to help decolonize philosophy of technology (PT) and make
it decolonial. Before turning to it, though, let us synthesize the
decolonial traits of the four bottom-up practices sketched before.

### 2AC---AT: Securitization Impact

#### Climate securitization good

NATO's Securitisation of Climate Change in the Arctic, GÜVENLİK
STRATEJİLERİ DERGİSİ, vol 20, no. 47, p. 91-94. DO :
10.17752/guvenlikstrtj.1430911)

The focal points of NATO's securitisation speech acts are related to the
military and political security sectors. Regarding the political
security sector, the [securitisation discourses are centred on conflicts
and violence within states.]{.underline} Specifically, NATO states that
[climate change intensifies the struggle for scarce
resources]{.underline} [like water, food, and land, which can lead to
conflicts58 and even wars59 or exacerbate existing
tensions]{.underline}.60 By emphasizing the worsening interconnected
security problems in vulnerable areas of the Middle East, the Sahel
region, and North Africa, NATO explains the effect of climate change in
providing a fertile environment for violent non-state actors, including
terrorist organizations.61 [**Regarding the Arctic region,** NATO has
re-emphasised the effect of the rapidly changing climate on shifting the
low-tension areas towards increasing global competition]{.underline}.
Recalling climate change as a "conflict multiplier",62 NATO notes that
authoritarian regimes often use military intimidation or aggression to
gain an advantage in the region.63

However, [NATO's discourse on military security centres on its military
operations]{.underline}.64 Within this framework, NATO highlights that
extreme weathers, like those in Iraq and the Arctic, have a detrimental
impact on Alliance bases, military operations, and supply routes.65
[NATO notes that the impact of rising sea levels, **specifically in the
Arctic region**, will have consequences for all naval
bases.]{.underline} Referring to the role of traditional security
structures and the military in building security, former [NATO Secretary
General Rasmussen stated that the Alliance should improve its efforts to
tackle the insecurity consequences of changing climate]{.underline} with
the following statements:66

"I believe, for example, that [the **security implications of climate
change need to be better integrated** into national security and defence
strategies]{.underline}-- as the US has done with its Quadrennial
Defence Review. That means asking our intelligence agencies to look at
this as one of their main tasks. It means military planners should
assess potential impacts, update their plans accordingly and consider
the capabilities they might need in future\... What about also including
cooperation that helps build capacity in the armed forces of our
Partners to better manage big storms, floods, or sudden movements of
populations?"

[NATO also securitises climate change in terms of its effects on human
security, which is primarily linked to migration]{.underline}.67 NATO
reports mainly indicate that rising sea levels and temperatures will
impact the lives of individuals and force people to migrate.68
[Underlining that threats to socio-economic development, food and water
security and health may cause climate migration and social
instability,]{.underline} the NATO Parliamentary Assembly Report
predicts that [by 2070, extreme temperatures will force billions of
people to migrate from regions including South America]{.underline},
Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. More importantly,
the report warns that Alliance members may face political, economic, and
humanitarian difficulties as these migratory flows shift towards
European countries.69

[Noting the varying effects of climate change on different states
regarding this humanitarian crisis]{.underline}, NATO states that
[**food production will decrease** by 10% with every 1.8-degree increase
in temperature and this insecurity will have a greater impact on
individuals and governments who cannot afford the financial burden of
this situation]{.underline}.70 Apart from migration, NATO recognises the
adverse outcomes of the changing climate on gender equality. According
to the Climate Change and Security Impact Assessment Report[, factors
such as gender, socio-economic structure, and social expectations will
influence how individuals are exposed to the harmful outcomes of
changing climate.]{.underline}71 The report indicates that **[climate
change will not affect every individual equally]{.underline}** and
particularly women and girls will be the most vulnerable group.

In connection with human security, [another area of NATO's focus is
economic security]{.underline}. By stressing economic disparities among
states caused by climate change, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly report
observed that the [economies of hot and disasterprone countries
decreased by over 25% between 1961 and 2010]{.underline}.72 The report
revealed that [developing countries, where agriculture, forestry, and
fisheries sectors are concentrated, will be the most vulnerable to the
negative outcomes of climate change]{.underline}. The NATO Parliamentary
Assembly has specifically stated that 30 million people may need
humanitarian assistance in the Sahel region, where climate risks overlap
with poor socio-economic conditions.73

[Energy security is the last key sector in NATO's climate change
discourse]{.underline}. Stating that Russia uses energy as a tool of
pressure, N[ATO argues that alternative ways must be found to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels and Russian oil and natural
gas]{.underline}.74 NATO has demonstrated its commitment to investing in
green energy technologies by arguing that reducing dependence on other
countries is not the solution.75 [**Regarding the Arctic's importance
for energy security**, NATO acknowledges Norway's crucial contribution
to enhancing the Alliance's comprehension and response to the challenges
in the High North]{.underline}, [thus **strengthening common security**,
including energy security]{.underline}. Attributing [its increased
military deployment in the Arctic to deter and respond to threats to
critical infrastructure]{.underline},76 NATO stated that [the gas
platform in the North Sea is essential in ensuring energy supply to
Norway, the Nordic Regions, and Europe]{.underline}.77

[The **securitisation** in different sectors **also enables NATO to take
two extraordinary measures** in the field of climate
issues]{.underline}. Firstly, [by incorporating climate change into the
three main areas]{.underline} of "Strategic Environment", "Crisis
Prevention and Management", and "Collaborative Security" in the 2022
Strategic Concept, [NATO aims to achieve its vision of becoming the
leading international organization **through adaptation**]{.underline}.
While reminding military units to remain strong against the adverse
results of climate change, [NATO presents the need for adjusting its
operations, equipment, and uniforms to better cope with severe weather
conditions.]{.underline}78 Secondly, [in the face of the worsening
security problems in the Arctic due to climate change]{.underline},79
[NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg re-affirmed NATO's commitment
to addressing issues like climate change and melting
glaciers]{.underline} with the use of Article V. Stating that NATO's
primary role is a military alliance, Stoltenberg emphasised that NATO
does not have a direct responsibility to combat climate change and
reduce emissions, unlike many other various institutions and
organizations that undertake this role. Instead, [by emphasizing the
relations between Article 5 and climate change, together with the
various security threats it poses, Stoltenberg stated that NATO will
focus on the security aspects of climate change]{.underline}.80 NATO
Deputy Secretary General Gottemoeller conveyed this understanding with
the following statement:81

"First of all, I do want to say that this area is of extraordinary
importance, and NATO recognises extraordinary importance in a strategic
sense and the climate changes that have been developing speed there have
only heightened that sense of strategic importance of the region. So,
NATO is both concerned in a historical sense about the Arctic region but
also, very I would say, seized on the matter that there is this
environmental issue, and a rapid climate change is going on there. So,
both aspects are something that NATO has been fully embracing."

To summarise, [NATO primarily addresses the securitisation of climate
change through the military, political, and energy security sectors in
the Arctic region]{.underline} while presenting human and economic
security sectors out of the Arctic context. [By drawing attention to its
various concrete impacts in these sectors, NATO securitises climate
change]{.underline}.

#### Structural constraints to securitization impacts---AND, even if no, Arctic risk and policy analysis is key to preventing escalation

**Fei and Peiqing 25** \[Gao Fei, Guo Peiqing; Skilled Lawer from Ocean
University of China, School of International Affairs and Public
Administration from Ocean University of China; March 31, 2025; \"Unique
risks and evolving trends in Arctic governance: a forward-looking
analysis based on policies and practices,\" European Journal of Futures
Research, p. 11-12;
https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-025-00250-y?#auth-Fei-Gao-Aff1\]

The low probability of conventional warfare and the potential risks of
hybrid warfare [**Despite intensifying re-securitization** factors in
Arctic governance, the likelihood of **direct military conflict
remains** comparatively **low**, as the region's geopolitical
competition is bounded by three constraints]{.underline}: the mutual
dilution of strategic resources, the harsh natural environment, and the
buffering role of institutional resilience.

First, [the **mutual dilution of strategic resources** curtails the
potential for military escalation]{.underline}. [Russia's deep
entanglement in the **Ukrainian** battlefield has significantly consumed
its resources, thereby restraining its capacity to project military
power in the Arctic.]{.underline} International [sanctions have further
impacted Russia's economy and defense industry]{.underline}. In
contrast, **[the United States currently operates only two
icebreakers]{.underline}**, indicating a substantial gap in its
icebreaking capability. [The next generation of icebreakers is not
expected to be delivered before 2029 \[80\], which will create at least
a decade-long equipment gap]{.underline}.

Second, the [Arctic's geographic features serve as a **natural barrier**
to conflict escalation]{.underline}. Its [extreme climate and sparse
infrastructure greatly increase the cost of military
operations]{.underline}. For example, research suggests that the [severe
weather in the Arctic heightens the risk of drone icing]{.underline}
\[81\], thereby limiting the effectiveness of modern combat systems.
Additionally, [the limited annual navigation window for the Northern Sea
Route further constrains military deployments]{.underline}.

Third, [institutional resilience helps to buffer the pressures of
securitization]{.underline}. [Although the Arctic Council is currently
fractured, **it has not completely collapsed**]{.underline}. [Norway has
pursued the gradual resumption of virtual meetings]{.underline} among
working groups, [maintaining cooperation in relatively low-sensitivity
areas]{.underline} such as climate monitoring and Indigenous rights
\[82\]. [Russia, while suspending economic contribution, continues to
hold its membership and emphasizes that the Arctic Council remains a
viable multilateral instrument]{.underline}, signaling that **[all
parties still regard it as a platform for collaboration]{.underline}**
\[83\]. This model of "[limited functional continuity" **creates a
protective buffer** between geopolitical conflict and functional
cooperatio]{.underline}n.

The Arctic's [unique geopolitical structure has created both geographic
and institutional firewalls against conventional military
confrontation]{.underline}, **[yet]{.underline}** [it also **open the
door to hybrid warfare**, in which cyberattacks, propaganda campaigns,
and the militarization of civilian infrastructure may all be employed as
instruments of conflict]{.underline}. Russia previously adopted a
similar "hybrid warfare" strategy during the Crimea crisis, exerting
considerable pressure on Western countries \[84\]. [In the Arctic, where
large-scale conventional military actions are difficult to undertake,
the covert and destructive characteristics of hybrid warfare become
particularly salient.]{.underline} Norway has repeatedly accused [Russia
of conducting cyber operations or disrupting GPS signals in areas near
their shared border. Under conditions of low-intensity confrontation,
both sides may develop new modes of conflict]{.underline}---not only
avoiding the uncontrollable risks of direct warfare but also
[continually reshaping Arctic power boundaries through dual-use
technologies and gray-zone operations]{.underline}. [This intermediate
state of "**neither war nor peace"** is likely to define the fundamental
paradigm of Arctic security competition in the near future.]{.underline}

Conclusion

**[To effectively address the risks]{.underline}** [inherent in Arctic
governance and achieve governance]{.underline} [objectives]{.underline},
[a **comprehensive and systematic understanding** of its unique risks,
**policies**, positions, and evolving trends is essential]{.underline}.
Arctic governance faces a complex interplay of geopolitical security
risks, environmental risks related to climate change, legal challenges,
and internal governance mechanism risks. These [risks are interwoven,
contributing to a high degree of uncertainty. They also do not operate
in isolation but instead trigger a chain of interactions]{.underline}.
For example, changes in the natural environment raise the value of
Arctic shipping routes, which in turn leads to legal disputes over
resource control, exacerbating geopolitical tensions and impeding
cooperation.

An **[analysis of Arctic policies and positions]{.underline}** [across
various stakeholders reveals that Arctic states balance traditional and
non-traditional security issues]{.underline}, [with a focus on
sovereignty, military security, environmental protection, and resource
development]{.underline}. In contrast[, non-Arctic states prioritize
non-traditional security issues, such as scientific research, economic
development, and Arctic shipping]{.underline}. The EU, which once played
a marginal role in Arctic participation, is transitioning into a more
significant geopolitical force. [Non-state actors, meanwhile, are
concentrated on issues like sustainable development and the welfare of
Indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

At present, Arctic states hold a dominant position in governance, with
policies geared toward enhancing control over Arctic affairs[. As NATO
expands and the Ukraine crisis continues to ripple outward, the trend of
"resecuritization" within Arctic governance may intensify]{.underline}.
However, **[the global nature of Arctic governance remains
unchanged]{.underline}**: [as a global public good, Arctic governance
will continue to have external effects on non-Arctic
states.]{.underline} Therefore, with multiple stakeholders--- BRICS,
SCO, the EU, NATO, and Indigenous organizations--- involved, [Arctic
governance will be structured around interwoven issue areas across
different domains and will further evolve toward a heterarchical
governance model]{.underline}. [Although the trend of
"re-securitization" introduces geopolitical risks to Arctic
governance]{.underline}, **[the scope of geopolitical contestation
remains limited]{.underline}**. While the [likelihood of a conventional
war in the Arctic remains low]{.underline}, the [potential risk of
low-intensity hybrid warfare has increased.]{.underline}

Despite delays in Arctic governance due to geopolitical tensions, [the
economic interests of stakeholders remain strong, and competition has
only intensified.]{.underline} [Military competition and bloc
confrontation will not foster the peaceful or stable development of the
Arctic]{.underline}. Instead, [cooperation and dialogue are key to
resolving these issues.]{.underline} Both Arctic and non-Arctic states
must balance their national interests with the shared interests of all
nations, enhancing international cooperation and governance mechanisms
in the region.
