[As the **ice cover** is lost, a trans-polar **route** is opening to
**connect** east Asia to Europe]{.underline} and the eastern coast of
North America. And [the ice barrier that once protected **Russia**'s
northern **shore** will be **exposed**]{.underline} as never before.
Russia represents 53% of the Arctic coastline and the need to protect
its northern border as the ice barrier melts is a key national security
concern.

Vladimir [**Putin**]{.underline} already had [ambitious **plans** for
the **n**]{.underline}orthern **[s]{.underline}**ea
**[r]{.underline}**oute, seeking to more than double the cargo traffic.
But over the past six years, [Russia has also built 475 **military
sites**]{.underline} along its northern border. The port of Severomorsk,
on [the Kola peninsula, is the base of the country's **northern
fleet**]{.underline}. In recent years, the [Russians have reactivated 50
Soviet outposts]{.underline} in the Arctic [and
**equipped**]{.underline} its northern fleet with
[**nuclear**]{.underline} and conventional [**missiles**.]{.underline}

The challenge of all this has not been purely logistical. [As the
**permafrost thaws**, the structural **base** for]{.underline} roads,
buildings and other [key infrastructure has **collapsed**. Russia is
trying to **deploy**]{.underline} huge amounts of [infrastructure and
**military capacity**]{.underline} to build structures on land that is
disintegrating, across roads that are disappearing. In December 2022, it
passed a new law requiring 90-day notification for any warship
transiting the northern sea route. It has also legislated that there be
no more than one warship allowed in these waters at any one time and
that any submarine be required to surface and show its flag along the
internal waters of the route.

Recent experience in the Pacific suggests that the US or Nato will seek
to assert rights of navigation under the UN convention on the law of the
sea. This is inherently risky. Russia could see such attempts to declare
freedom of navigation as a provocation. But failure to enforce these
freedoms carries an opposite risk: without maintaining a presence in the
region, Nato members would be allowing Russia's new law to become
normalised. [A careful **balancing act** is essential to]{.underline}
maintain presence and [not allow **Russia** to **close off** this region
of the **Arctic** as its private domain.]{.underline}

Moscow sees Nato borders expanding. It fears encirclement. Its
experience of humiliation in Ukraine has increased this tension. Two
Arctic brigades have been deployed to Ukraine with disastrous
consequences; the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies estimates that
more than 1,000 personnel have been lost. [As **Russia**'s]{.underline}
conventional land [forces have been depleted]{.underline} in the Arctic,
[the Kremlin will **turn to** its **naval** and **submarine** capacity.
The potential to inflict damage to **undersea cables** and

[use]{.underline} against his opponents.

At the moment, it seems our politicians are not looking beyond the
Ukraine war. They need to. A weakened and resentful Russia does not make
for a stable global order. We have already seen [Putin **pivot** to
China and use the **Arctic** as a **bargaining chip**]{.underline} to
strengthen that relationship. It is scarcely a month since the two
countries' coastguards signed a memorandum in Murmansk about cooperation
in the Arctic. China's price for providing Russia with support over
Ukraine could be requesting naval access to Russian bases in the Arctic.

On a recent visit to the Ny-Ålesund international research station on
Svalbard, it was depressing to hear that [**scientific cooperation**
with Russia]{.underline} on climate matters has effectively
[**cease**d]{.underline}. The Arctic is an environment where
[cooperation is **essential**. Arctic science must be done over the long

3.2. Impact of air emissions

At present, the fuel used by ships is mainly crude oil, which produces a
variety of direct emissions after combustion (Sun, 2020), including CO2,
CH4, NOx, SOx, CO, hydrocarbons (HC), volatile organic compounds (VOC),
BC, PM and other substances. With the increase of shipping volume in the
Arctic, the accompanying [[shipping emissions]{.mark} are
[affecting]{.mark} the [atmospheric composition of the Arctic]{.mark}
region, [polluting the Arctic air]{.mark}, and disturbing the local RF,
all of which [seriously threaten the natural and ecological
environment]{.mark} of the Arctic]{.underline}.

3.2.1. Air pollution

Pollutants in the air include CO, NOx, SOx, PM, VOC, and other
substances, although the current air pollution in the Arctic mainly
comes from Europe, Asia, and the Americas (mid-latitudes) (Law and
Stohl, 2007). However, [air [pollutants]{.mark} from shipping in the
Arctic [have increased rapidly in recent years]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Mjelde et al., 2014; Schroeder et al., 2017). There is much evidence
that ship [[emissions]{.mark} in the Arctic have [affected]{.mark} the
atmospheric composition and underlying [air quality in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Law et al., 2017; Winther et al., 2014),
and with mixed negative impacts on the Arctic environment.

The [silent transformation of our oceans is unfolding at a pace that
demands urgent attention]{.underline}. According to a recent
international study led by Plymouth Marine Laboratory, ocean
[acidification has already crossed a critical threshold]{.underline},
with profound implications for marine ecosystems, coastal economies, and
global stability. Although this change is invisible to the naked eye,
its [effects are far-reaching and devastating]{.underline}. As we
explore this peril, it's crucial to understand the stakes involved and
the potential paths forward. How will this invisible threat reshape our
world, and what can we do to mitigate its impact?

Crossing a Critical Threshold: The Alarming Reality

In 2020, the [global ocean surpassed a vital threshold of acidification
far earlier than predicted]{.underline}, yet this did not trigger the
expected political alarm. The key indicator for this threshold is
aragonite saturation, a mineral essential for forming the shells and
skeletons of many marine organisms. When its levels drop by more than
20% from pre-industrial times, marine ecosystems are at risk.

Research shows that this biological and chemical barrier has been
breached in over half of the waters between the surface and 656 feet
deep, areas dense with marine life. Contrary to popular belief, most
biodiversity is not concentrated at the surface but within these
intermediate waters. Professor Helen Findlay emphasizes that species in
these zones are as crucial as the visible corals in shallow waters.

The breach of this threshold signifies more than just a scientific
measurement; it is a concrete warning. The [oceans are no longer
effectively buffering CO₂]{.underline}, and water chemistry has already
been altered enough to threaten vital functions like calcification and
reproduction. This [change accelerates biodiversity loss, destabilizes
food chains, and makes restoring marine habitats increasingly
difficult]{.underline}. This quiet crossing marks a significant shift in
the health of our oceans.

Lost Habitats and Endangered Species

The [impacts]{.underline} of ocean acidification [are no longer
theoretical]{.underline}; they are [now visibly affecting the most
sensitive marine habitats]{.underline}. The study led by Plymouth Marine
Laboratory reveals that 43% of tropical and subtropical coral reefs have
already lost the chemical conditions necessary for their survival.
Although these reefs cover only about 1% of the ocean surface, they host
over a quarter of known marine biodiversity. Their [rapid decline
directly jeopardizes the reproduction, feeding, and protection of
thousands of species]{.underline}.

Further north, [in the cold waters of polar regions]{.underline},
[pteropods]{.underline}---tiny planktonic mollusks known as "sea
butterflies"---[have lost up to 61% of their viable
habitat]{.underline}. Despite their small size, [they are a fundamental
link in Arctic and Antarctic food webs]{.underline}, serving as prey for
species like salmon, cod, and whales.

[Coastal bivalves]{.underline}, such as oysters and mussels, [are also
losing ground]{.underline}. Globally, they have experienced a [13%
reduction in coastal zones where essential biological
functions]{.underline}---growth, calcification, reproduction---[can
still occur properly]{.underline}. These losses are directly tied to the
pH drop caused by the dissolution of CO₂ in seawater, which converts
into carbonic acid, making the environment more acidic and reducing the
availability of calcium carbonate, vital for shell and skeleton
formation. As this availability decreases, [marine organisms become more
vulnerable, threatening ecosystem balance and coastal economies
dependent on them]{.underline}.

The Challenge of Visibility and Response

One of the great paradoxes of ocean acidification lies in its
invisibility. Unlike an oil spill or coral bleaching, this threat does
not present an obvious visual cue. "There is no clear alarm signal,"
notes Steve Widdicombe, Scientific Director at Plymouth Marine
Laboratory. On the shoreline, nothing suggests that water pH has dropped
critically. This absence of direct perception complicates public and
political awareness, despite already measurable impacts.

A striking example occurred in the Pacific Northwest around 2010. The
oyster industry, well-established in this region, suddenly suffered an
unexpected production collapse. Investigations revealed that deep
waters, naturally more CO₂-rich, had upwelled to the surface,
exacerbated by global acidification. These corrosive waters disrupted
the development of oyster larvae, unable to form their shells properly.

The response from industry professionals was immediate and technical.
Hatcheries installed sensors to monitor the pH of pumped water in
real-time, adding alkaline solutions to neutralize the acidity. While
this system saved the industry locally, it remains costly and
inaccessible to many countries. Jessie Turner, Director of the
International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, emphasizes,
"Adaptation is possible, but it requires resources, monitoring, and
committed governance."

Ocean Acidification: A Silent Emergency, A Possible Turning Point

Ocean acidification is progressing quietly, but its [effects are
concrete, documented, and irreversible]{.underline} in the short term.
This is not a distant scenario but a reality substantiated by robust
data. By crossing the planetary safety threshold in 2020, the [oceans
have reached a critical point]{.underline}, already affecting food
chains, coral reefs, and economic sectors like fishing and aquaculture.

Researchers call for a clear response. Reducing global CO₂ emissions is
essential to slow the phenomenon sustainably. Additionally, local
adaptation measures must develop, such as water chemistry monitoring,
protecting resilient habitats, or limiting organic pollution.

The challenge remains to integrate this often secondary topic into
climate and marine policies. As Jessie Turner warns, the risk lies in
government inaction, leaving room for inadequately regulated private
initiatives, like certain forms of ocean geoengineering that remain
poorly scientifically evaluated.

The upcoming UN Ocean Summit in Nice, coinciding with the publication of
this crucial data, offers a concrete window for action. By incorporating
acidification into international discussions, decision-makers can still
influence the trajectory. Could this event mark the beginning of a
coordinated response to a long-overlooked crisis?

Hypoxia survival limits and human extinction

[Even with genetic and phenotypic adaptation]{.underline}, the parabolic
[decline]{.underline} described by this mathematical model predicts a
scenario in which [atmospheric oxygen concentration falls to levels
below the threshold where human survival and reproduction may be
sustained.]{.underline} Defining this point in terms of oxygen
concentration is difficult, and our hypothesis is based on the highest
elevations known to sustain lifelong human habitation. The highest
permanent settlement in the present day is the Peruvian village of La
Riconada, at an altitude of 5100 m, which has around 30,000 inhabitants
\[37\]. Native villagers have survived there for at least 40 years and
current residents have successfully gone through child birth to create
the next generation at this altitude \[38\], however, it is not known
whether the birth rate can sustain this population indefinitely. The
highest permanent settlement on record is the (now abandoned) Chilean
mining village of Quilcha (5340 m), which was discovered by the 1935
International High Altitude Expedition to Chile \[39\]. It has been
argued that this represents the upper limit of long-term human
habitation, because the residents chose to sleep at this elevation and
make a daily ascent to the mine above. PatO2 at the Quilcha settlement
is 11.3 kPa (slightly higher than 50% of the current PatO2 at sea
level). The parabolic deoxygenation model described here predicts that
PatO2 at sea level will reach this threshold in \~3600 years from now.
During this time, the human species is likely to undergo further
positive selection for physiological phenotypes conveying survival
advantage in hypoxic conditions. [Studies of high-altitude residents
tell us that while such adaptations may enable us to function relatively
well in an atmosphere that contains just over half the oxygen we breathe
today; many will suffer the long-term consequences. Higher rates of
maternal pre-eclampsia and death, increased perinatal mortality, low
birth-weights]{.underline} (and the myriad consequences of this in
adulthood) and [escalating pulmonary disease will curtail life
expectancy and population growth.]{.underline} Those individuals with
independent comorbidities, particularly chronic respiratory and cardiac
disease, may suffer exacerbation of their symptoms, reduced function,
and reduced length of life. Highlanders may be forced to descend as life
becomes intolerable at hypobaric elevations, therefore reducing the
surface of Earth that we can populate. The burden of ill health will
begin to overwhelm the capability of healthcare services. The last
prevailing human phenotypes may resemble those of current high-altitude
populations: with enhanced abilities to extract precious oxygen from the
atmosphere or deliver it to the tissues, and perhaps superior cellular
mechanisms to improve efficiency of oxygen use and defend against
hypoxic stress.

It is important to stress that the parabolic model described here is
mathematical rather than geophysical \[5\]. Other authors have disputed
the idea that [global deoxygenation on a catastrophic scale is
possible]{.underline} \[40\]. One of the key reasons cited for this is
that the determining factor in global oxygen decline is fossil fuel
usage and current estimates predict that oil, coal, and gas stocks will
last 35, 107, and 37 years, respectively \[41\]. Thus, is it plausible
that the increased fossil fuel usage in recent years has caused a
temporary acceleration of the deoxygenation phenomenon, which will
resolve once reserves have been exhausted. This scenario would predict a
very different decline in atmospheric oxygen from the one we have
described, with a fall of only a fraction of a percent in 4400 years
\[42\]. Consensus in this area has not yet been achieved, but the need
to understand the limits of long-term human survival under progressively
hypoxic conditions cannot be questioned, whether we are considering the
persistence of the human race in the mathematical model discussed here,
or other contexts in which atmospheric oxygen may become scarce, such as
future long-term space expeditions. Other e[nvironmental changes may
also impact the ability of humans to acclimatize to hypoxia during
global deoxygenation]{.underline} and these [include]{.underline} the
[rise in both temperature and concentration of carbon
dioxide]{.underline}. It is hard to predict the precise effect of these
additional physiological stressors but [both are likely to reduce
further our chances of long-term survival]{.underline}. In particular,
[rising carbon dioxide levels could lead to metabolic problems if
individuals fail to adapt]{.underline} to this adequately. High blood
carbon dioxide levels (hypercarbia) can cause acidosis, hypertension,
and tachycardia. Those with underlying lung chronic disease may suffer
greatest from this. In a simple, short-term experimental model of
Earth's atmosphere, a novel experiment that used plants to generate
oxygen and consume carbon dioxide in a sealed hypoxic chamber noted a
high carbon concentration (0.66%) towards the end of the 48-h experiment
\[43\].

The [atmospheric changes will also impact other animals on
Earth]{.underline}, and [failure to adapt will result in extinction both
on land and in the seas and oceans]{.underline}. All [aerobic life forms
will suffer as oxygen is removed from the atmosphere]{.underline}. In
addition, plant metabolism may also be detrimentally affected. Already,
the rising carbon dioxide concentration has been predicted to reduce the
rate of photorespiration, and a falling oxygen concentration may
exacerbate this. While the overall effect of a reduction in
photorespiration remains unclear, we do know that complete removal of
this pathway could lead to metabolic disaster for the plants that use it
\[44\].

2.3 The Arctic as a sentinel for the rest of the world

The circumpolar [Arctic region]{.underline}, as defined for the purpose
of CAFF at its inaugural meeting (see Figure 1 - CAFF map of the
Arctic), covers some 14.8 million km of land and 13 million km of ocean.
It [plays a key role in the physical, chemical and biological balance of
the globe]{.underline}. The Arctic region encompasses relatively
pristine environments, compared to the rest of the globe. [Vast
wilderness areas are crucial for the preservation of the Arctic's unique
biological diversity]{.underline}, and the Arctic is additionally of
much cultural, economic, and recreational value. The [CAFF]{.underline}
overview [report]{.underline} (2001) [highlighted such diverse actual
and potential importance of Arctic biodiversity as for fuel,
food]{.underline} (e.g. fisheries), [fodder, nature tourism, ecosystem
functioning, feedbacks from ecosystems to the global atmosphere, future
genetic recombinations and adaptations, fiber pharmaceuticals,
anti-microbial drugs, and industrial enzymes]{.underline} (from
extremophiles).

The Arctic is unique in biological, physical, and chemical properties.
Life in the Arctic has adapted to extreme conditions of darkness, cold
and a brief summer season where food becomes plentiful. Arctic ecology
is shaped by the severity of the climate and its variability in space
and time. Arctic species must survive long periods when food is limited
or unavailable, or otherwise migrate to more southerly latitudes, as
many do to all corners of the globe. Arctic species must be adapted to
respond quickly when conditions improve. The growing season is brief and
intense. When sunlight reaches the oceans in the spring, plankton bloom.
On land, the growth of plants begins the summer feast for the
terrestrial species, allowing the breeding, raising of young, and
storage for the upcoming winter. [At the foundation of the intricate
marine food webs are highly specialized species of phytoplankton and sea
ice algae, especially adapted to the]{.underline} extreme conditions of
darkness and cold, and the f[reshwater-brine conditions of the sea
ice-ocean interface]{.underline}. Terrestrial and freshwater food webs
are usually simpler than those in the marine environment, but are
closely linked to the marine ecosystem, e.g. through run-off and many
creatures which move between the different ecosystems.

The complexity of Arctic biodiversity stems in part from the interplay
between the terrestrial species, habitats and ecosystems, with those in
the marine environment. In the overlapping structure of ecosystems, [all
species]{.underline} in a system [depend]{.underline} to some degree [on
the ecological functions of other species such as food production,
competition, and predation]{.underline}; and species behavior such as
reproduction and migration are closely linked with these functions. With
an integrated, ecosystem-based approach to monitoring, the impacts of
stressors to these ecological functions are better identified and
understood, as this type of monitoring bridges ecosystems, habitats and
species. For example: seabirds nest on land but may feed in the ocean or
in lakes and rivers on fish and invertebrates. Salmon, Arctic Char and
certain other fish species are anadromous -- crossing from the marine
ecosystem to the freshwater ecosystem to breed. Polar bears den on land
in snow banks, but hunt almost exclusively out on the edge of the sea
ice. Seals make their homes in and on the sea ice and hunt in the ocean.
Indigenous Peoples hunt across all ecosystems and habitats in the
Arctic, marine, terrestrial and freshwater.

Monitoring of the natural and anthropogenic impacts to the food webs and
the ecological functions of [the Arctic environment and
ecosystems]{.underline} provides critical information about the status
and trends of Arctic species and the integrity of the food webs on which
they depend for their survival. For humans, this [directly relates to
the socio-economic stability of]{.underline} their
[societies]{.underline}.

The Arctic has high genetic diversity among its species. Many migratory
species breed in the Arctic but spend the non-breeding season at more
southerly latitudes[. As a polar region, greater and faster impacts are
being seen in the Arctic from climate change. Consequently Arctic
biodiversity is experiencing both greater and earlier impacts than many
other parts of the globe]{.underline}. These issues, vulnerabilities and
impacts are more fully documented in Arctic Flora and Fauna: Status and
Conservation (2001), and Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate
Impact Assessment (2004).

Of the approximately 450 species of birds, which breed or have bred in
the Arctic region, 279 breed in significant numbers within the Arctic
and spend the boreal (northern hemisphere) winter in significant numbers
outside the CAFF member states. [Migratory birds from the Arctic reach
every part of the world]{.underline} except the interior of Antarctica.
Thirty species reach southern Africa, 26 species reach Australia and New
Zealand, 22 species reach southern South America and several pelagic
species reach the southern oceans.

[Virtually all the world's major ecosystems support some Arctic breeding
birds during the boreal winter]{.underline}, with Arctic migrants
occupying every major habitat in every major region. The conservation of
all Arctic breeding birds throughout their migratory ranges is a global
challenge, covering virtually all of the world's major terrestrial and
marine ecosystems, and requires a high level of international
cooperation which can be achieved in part through the CBMP.

In addition to the migrating birds, several species of land and marine
mammals migrate to the Arctic in search of rich food resources.
[Migration routes link Arctic species to marine and terrestrial
ecosystems throughout the world]{.underline} including the Antarctic.
[The Arctic's nutrient-rich coldwater feeding grounds are crucial to the
survival of many species of whales and are the foundation for the huge
numbers of Arctic fish stocks. Northern waters]{.underline},
particularly the North Atlantic and the Bering Sea, [are some of the
world's largest and most important marine fisheries. The link between
the survival of humans and sustainability of the living environment is
therefore obvious and of paramount importance]{.underline}.

**[1NC \-\-- Supply Chains Defense]{.underline}**

**No [supply chains]{.underline} impact.**

[A [closer look at]{.mark} **global value [chains]{.mark}**]{.underline}
reveals ways that both public-sector and private-sector actors have
prioritized short-term efficiency at the expense of long-term
resilience. But it also [[reveals]{.mark} a [**mismatch**
between]{.mark} a lot of **over[heated]{.mark} political
[rhetoric]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} an [**actual understanding** of]{.mark}
how the global [economy]{.mark} works. Many of the past year\'s [issues
are **temporary**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and when it comes to strained
global supply chains, globalization is more often the solution than the
problem.

When Ford completed its massive River Rouge plant in 1928, it created a
factory that controlled every facet of car production, including its own
steel mill. Trade volume was high during this era, but very few
intermediate goods crossed borders. In the time since then, the
industrial organization of production has changed a wee bit.

Whereas trade a century ago was primarily in finished goods,
manufacturing now has disaggregated itself into myriad chains of
subcontractors. As one MIT Sloan Management Review article summarized
the phenomenon, we have a \"deeper tiering of supply chains whereby
suppliers draw upon their suppliers who in turn draw on their own
networks of suppliers in multistage production networks.\"

Why did this happen? The end of the Cold War eliminated most
geopolitical concerns about where to locate production facilities. Basic
trade theory meant an awful lot of facilities expanded in China, the
low-cost manufacturing locale. The reduction of transportation and
communication costs made it easier for production to be disaggregated
and managed at a distance. \"Just-in-time\" manufacturing encouraged
companies to hold minimal inventories and count on suppliers to respond
quickly to fluctuations in consumer demand. Management consultants
stressed the efficiency of offshore outsourcing.

The most widely cited example of the globalized supply chain is Apple\'s
iPhone. Most people know that the iPhone is manufactured in China and
exported to the United States. What is less well known is that China
plays only a minor role in the creation of its added value. The
iPhone\'s flash drive comes from the Japanese firm Toshiba. Samsung, a
South Korean firm, provides the application processor. A German company
provides the camera module, and a U.S. subcontractor provides the
Bluetooth application. All of these parts are then assembled by a
Taiwanese firm, Foxconn, with operations in Shenzhen, China.

The management consultants were right about the efficiency. While
productivity in the service sector stagnated after the turn of the
century, manufacturing productivity continued to soar.

The political economy advantages were also apparent after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers. The last time a financial shock of that magnitude
hit, the trade wars of the Great Depression began. 2008 was different. A
World Bank study examined trade restrictions immediately after 2008 and
found that \"vertical specialization\" was the most powerful economic
factor that limited tariff increases. [[The **more** a
country\'s]{.mark} economy was **[enmeshed in global]{.mark} supply
[chains]{.mark}**[, the **less likely** it was to **raise
barriers**]{.mark} **to trade**. **Global supply chains** help explain
why the **Great Recession** **did not lead** to **trade
wars**]{.underline} like those of the Great Depression.

So these global value chains seemed like an unalloyed good. And then the
2010s happened.

As global supply chains grew more and more complex, there were signs of
trouble on the horizon. In 2011, the Chao Phraya River floods in
Thailand severely but temporarily constricted production of hard disk
drives, because close to half of global output was sourced from
Thailand. In 2017, U.S. hospitals faced an acute shortage of IV bags
after Hurricane Maria knocked out a key production facility in Puerto
Rico.

The 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit Fukushima in Japan affected key
nodes in global manufacturing. Some firms suspended sales of cars in
certain colors because key ingredients were stored near Fukushima and
inaccessible. An iPhone designer warned The New York Times that \"there
are all kinds of little specialized parts without second sources, like
connectors, speakers, microphones, batteries and sensors that don\'t get
the love they deserve. Many are from Japan.\"

These supply chain hiccups highlighted one underanticipated phenomenon
of globalization: Rather than strengthen market competition, it
strengthened market concentration. Consumer-facing firms from Walmart to
Ford to Apple to Home Depot stressed cost minimization ubër alles. Firms
that excelled at efficiently producing one part became near-monopolists
for that component. This is how Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) became the dominant global supplier of customized
semiconductor chips. Other chipmakers focused on design, subcontracting
to the Taiwanese firm for the physical production. As TSMC accrued
comparative advantages in chip production, even established competitors
such as Intel struggled.

The return of geopolitical competition has also flummoxed producers.
China is a critical node in almost every global value chain. Over the
last decade, as Xi Jinping has consolidated his power, the Chinese state
has taken a number of steps that have raised hackles in Western
capitals. Some of these, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, have been
overhyped. Others, such as the subjugation of the Uyghurs, repression in
Hong Kong, increasing control over United Nations agencies, and the
expansion of China\'s nuclear arsenal, have not. Xi\'s \"wolf warrior
diplomacy\" has triggered evaluations in the United States, Europe, and
Pacific Rim about just how vulnerable their economies are to disruptions
from Chinese suppliers. The 2010 rare earth embargo on Japan in response
to a territorial dispute in the East China Sea offered a warning about
how China could weaponize the interdependence of global value chains;
Huawei\'s dominance in 5G offered another. Erratic U.S. policies during
the Trump administration served in turn as a warning about how Western
governments could disrupt global value chains.

Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the problems of both market
concentration and political whimsy. As China reeled from the pandemic\'s
first wave, there were disruptions across the global economy. China
exercised state power to seize domestically produced personal protective
equipment and other medical supplies; the United States soon
reciprocated. According to Global Trade Alert, 157 export controls on
medical supplies and medicines were put in place across 86 jurisdictions
in the first six months of the pandemic. U.S. leaders expressed concerns
about vulnerability to China weaponizing its role in medical supply
chains. So did journalists: In May 2021, 60 Minutes warned that \"COVID
showed that the global supply chain of chips is
fragile.\" The Washington Post concurred: \"The pandemic has exposed
fragile global supply chains across multiple continents.\"

Countries exercised vaccine nationalism, stunting global immunization
against COVID-19, which in turn facilitated the development of more
dangerous variants of the novel coronavirus. The delta variant has
penetrated Chinese port facilities, Malaysian chip factories, and
Bangladeshi textile plants, leading to periodic shutdowns that have
spiked container shipping prices and lengthened order backlogs.

Throughout all this, producers seemed to be stuck in quicksand. The past
decade has not been shy in signaling to firms that there might be risks
to increasingly disaggregated global supply chains. If natural
disasters, pandemics, and geopolitical tensions were not enough, now
management consultants are piling on. The same consultants who urged
offshoring a generation ago are now telling firms to retrench from
globalized supply chains. But most firms do not seem terrifically
interested in changing their practices. Multinational corporations like
Apple have not altered their supply chains in response to political
pressure. Whether one looks at business surveys or journalistic
accounts, the results are the same: Most U.S. firms do not plan on
moving their supply chains away from China.

A world in which the distribution of goods is held up due to constant
supply chain disruptions seems less than ideal. What can be done about
it?

One thing that would be great is if everyone would acknowledge that a
lot of the issues with global value chains right now have to do with
demand more than supply.

When the pandemic began, there was an immediate and acute contraction of
demand. Producers assumed that this would be the new normal and reduced
their output. They were mistaken. The combination of emergency COVID-19
relief and the work-from-home phenomenon led to a resurgence of demand.
The affluent class had considerable sums of disposable income. The
pandemic made spending on services a less viable option, so instead they
spent it on stuff: cars, furniture, home office equipment, gaming
systems, house renovations, and so forth. The shortage of semiconductor
chips was caused by the unexpected twin rebounds in demand for cars and
consumer electronics. As one Federal Reserve analysis explained, \"the
pause in demand was much shorter and the rebound in demand was much
stronger than anticipated.\" These demand surges surprised suppliers and
led to the production bottlenecks that are currently seizing up Pottery
Barn orders.

While demand has been stronger than expected, [**supply** in **[critical
sectors coped better]{.mark}** than **expected**. The
[predicted]{.mark}]{.underline} pandemic [[breakdowns]{.mark} in supply
chains]{.underline} for food and medical supplies [[proved to be
**overstated**]{.mark}. Surveys]{.underline} of logistical firms last
year [revealed that the]{.underline} pandemic had [**minimal effects**
on their operational capabilities]{.underline}. Even when it came to
medicines and personal protective equipment, there were only minor
disruptions after the initial shock in March 2020. [[Claims that]{.mark}
the global [supply chain]{.mark}]{.underline} in medical products
[[**rendered states vulnerable** to **weaponized interdependence**
proved to be]{.mark} **wildly [exaggerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
pandemic affected service sectors such as tourism far more severely than
any manufacturing sector. Indeed, Slate\'s Jordan Weissmann pointed out
recently that \"imports were up 5 percent year-over-year in September,
and up 17 percent compared with the same time in 2019.\" This happened
despite the decline in air passenger traffic, which restricted yet
another means of shipping goods by air. Supply has increased---it\'s
just that demand has surged even more.

[The [**private sector** is **responding**]{.mark} to **market signals**
[by **ramping up production** and **ensuring multiple**]{.mark} **supply
[lines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Intel, Samsung, and TSMC are all spending
tens of billions of dollars to build new chip foundries in the United
States. Skyrocketing shipping prices are incentivizing additional
construction of new container ships. The Wall Street Journal reports
that in the first five months of 2021, there were nearly twice as many
orders for new container ships as there were in all of 2019 and 2020
combined. To ensure holiday inventory, large retailers like Walmart and
Home Depot have chartered their own container ships. Container shipping
rates have already started to decline from September peaks.

But these capital investments designed to boost resilience will take
years to kick in. This time lag is one reason private-sector actors have
been so slow to invest in resilient supply chains in the past. If
disruptions are expected to be temporary, such investments might seem
like overreactions. Given the billions of dollars at stake, this sort of
risk aversion is unfortunate but understandable.

Long-term investments in resilience make some sense, but short-term
investments in robustness make even more sense. Resilience is the
ability to adapt in response to permanent shocks to the system.
Robustness is the ability to maintain output levels in response to a
short-term hit. The most obvious way that firms can enhance their
robustness is to warehouse supplies of key components. Car
manufacturers, for example, are pledging to ramp up their inventories of
critical components to ensure a more reliable production stream.

Yet the auto sector appears to be the exception and not the rule in
bolstering inventories. For most firms, increasing reserves of component
parts is an expensive proposition. To a corporation, holding inventory
is like holding cash: Why sit on an asset that yields no rate of return?
Lean manufacturing was popular in the first place because it boosted
profits.

Even as semiconductors have grown scarce, chipmakers and chip customers
have battled over which firms will shoulder the costs of carrying
greater inventory. Under the just-in-time system, the chipmakers had
held the inventory. As one semiconductor CEO said earlier this year, the
shortage has shifted the balance of power: \"If they expect the
semiconductor \[suppliers\] to be the bank, to keep having a big working
capital to support them, they can forget it.\"

Bottlenecks in the global supply chain threaten the macroeconomic and
microeconomic health of the United States. On the macro side, supply
chain issues are driving fears of inflation; if not brought under
control, this could cause the Fed to prematurely raise interest rates. A
related problem is consumer panic over rumored shortages. See, for
example, the effect of the ransomware attack on Colonial
Pipeline---drivers panicked and went to gas stations to top off their
tanks, temporarily worsening the problem.

On the micro side, the high price of inventories and shipping imperils
market competition. Supply risks privilege larger firms over small and
medium enterprises. Multinational corporations have the capacity to make
large-scale investments in resilience and robustness. They are also able
to use their market power to ensure continued access to scarce container
billets in ships; your local bodega, by contrast, is unable to charter
an entire container ship. The more stretched the global supply chain,
the more sectors that look like monopolies rather than a competitive
marketplace.

When it comes to fixes, there has been a surplus of really dumb ideas
about what the government could do. Hawley\'s idea of essentially
nationalizing supply chains stands out as the dumbest. Such a move would
take well more than the three-year window he proposes to execute. Prices
would permanently rise due to new inefficiencies. The opportunities for
rent-seeking are legion; every sector would be lobbying Washington that
what they produce is \"critical.\" It is also worth remembering that
Hawley\'s go-to policies of protectionism and immigration restriction
shoulder much of the blame for the lack of truck drivers that have
contributed to delivery delays.

The Biden administration\'s responses have run the gamut. White House
Press Secretary Jen Psaki tried to laugh it all away by reducing the
issue to \"the tragedy of the treadmill that\'s delayed.\" That will not
play well with a country used to just-in-time delivery and trying to
move past the pandemic. Nor will Biden\'s proposal to open the port of
Los Angeles 24/7 have much of an effect. While ports are currently
jammed, there are also bottlenecks in railroad cars and truck
drivers---both of which are issues that predated the pandemic. Even if
the port gets unstuck, the traffic jam will just migrate to America\'s
railroads and highways.

Looking at manufacturing more generally, some firms have acknowledged
that they were unaware of the geographic distribution of their suppliers
prior to the pandemic. This is one area where the Biden
administration\'s efforts to collect data on supply chains could be
useful.

If the federal government can identify (or even stock) priority
components that would affect multiple sectors, those strategic reserves
could theoretically bolster the robustness of the U.S. economy. But not
if such investments become a stalking horse for protectionism.

[**[All]{.mark}** of the **[evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the past
year [[suggests]{.mark} that [**globalization** helps economies
**recover**]{.mark} more quickly [from]{.mark} supply chain

homeshoring. This is because most [[**shocks are localized**,
and]{.mark} [**access** to global]{.mark} value [chains **facilitates
recovery**]{.mark} more quickly]{.underline}. Indeed, protectionism is
partly to blame for the current mess. As the Cato Institute\'s Scott
Lincicome recently noted, the Jones Act, which mandates use of
U.S.-built, crewed, and flagged ships to move cargo from one U.S. port
to another, has raised the costs of coastwise shipping, putting even
more pressure on truck and train transport.

[Competition and [disagreements between Arctic states are]{.mark} likely
to continue. **This is "[normal]{.mark}"** within the international
system]{.underline}. Although overly optimistic rhetoric related to
"Arctic exceptionalism" may have set up false expectations that the
post-Cold War Circumpolar North would be entirely cooperative, this is
unrealistic. Seeing every point of friction as a portend that the Arctic
regime is unravelling, or misreading every investment in defence and
security as an indicator of revisionist designs for the region, tends to
perpetuate a bifurcated debate between so-called "realists" and "liberal
internationalists" predicated on empirically skewed foundations.
[Strategic rivalry between Russia and the West (including Canada) may
have "spill over" effects on circumpolar security, but we maintain that
[there is **little likelihood** of conflict]{.mark} between Arctic
states generated by Arctic **resources**, **boundary disputes**, or
**governance issues**]{.underline}.84 Similarly, [Russian and Canadian
[investments in defence]{.mark}]{.underline} and security capabilities
in the Arctic, when appropriately contextualized, [[do **not fit** the
criteria for an]{.mark} Arctic "[arms race]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Canada's June 2017 defence policy, "Strong, Secure, Engaged," reiterates
longstanding images of the Arctic as a region undergoing massive change.
"The Arctic region represents an important international crossroads
where issues of climate change, international trade, and global security
meet," the policy describes. [Rather than promoting a narrative of
inherent **competition** or impending conflict]{.underline}, however,
[the narrative points out that "[Arctic states have]{.mark} long
[**cooperated** on **economic**, **environmental**, and **safety
issues**]{.mark}**,** particularly through the Arctic Council, the
premier body for cooperation in the region]{.underline}. [All Arctic
[states have]{.mark} an enduring [interest in **continuing**]{.mark}
this productive
**[collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline}."[[85]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR85) This
last sentence suggests that **[Russia]{.underline}** (described
elsewhere in the policy document as a state "willing to test the
international security environment" that had reintroduced "a degree of
major power competition") [does not inherently threaten **Arctic
stability** given its **vested interests** in the region]{.underline}.
Accordingly, the drivers of Arctic change cited in Canada's policy
emphasize the rise of security and safety challenges rather than
conventional defence threats, thus confirming the line of reasoning that
has become well entrenched in Canadian defence planning over the last
decade.[[86]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR86)

This logic also mirrors some main tenets of Russian security and defence
strategy, particularly on the salience of investments in dual-use
capabilities that can address national defence and "soft security"
objectives. These new roles do not preclude military power from
fulfilling its traditional functions, such as protection of national
territory, power projection, deterrence, and containment. In
[Russia]{.underline}'s case, [[**military power** is an]{.mark}
[expression of]{.mark} great power **[status]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Geography and geopolitics make the Arctic essential to strategic
deterrence. The Kremlin also asserts military power as a means to
ascertain and assert sovereignty over its EEZ and continental shelf.
Although the probability of an armed conflict over Arctic maritime
disputes remains low, Russian strategists view military power as a tool
to prevent such disputes from escalating to a dangerous phase.
Furthermore, [[defence]{.mark} and security [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}
(including border and coast guards) [[are intended to protect]{.mark}
Moscow's **[economic interests]{.mark}** in the North, fight
**smuggling** and **poaching**, and prevent illegal
**migration**]{.underline}. They are also deployed to prevent potential
terrorist attacks against critical infrastructure, including oil and gas
platforms, nuclear plants, and nuclear waste storage facilities.

Arctic policy statements in [both Russia and Canada reflect both hard
and soft considerations]{.underline}, with the latter featuring most
prominently in external-facing messaging. For example, while
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} October 2020 Arctic [development
[strategy]{.mark} includes provisions to boost regional]{.underline}
military [capabilities]{.underline} "in accordance with current and
forecasted military threats," the document [[does **not** put]{.mark}
excessive [**emphasis** on **military**]{.mark}**-related
[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, [[it commits to]{.mark}
implement "multi-vector foreign policy activities aimed at preserving
the Arctic as a **territory** of **peace**, **stability**, and
**[mutually beneficial cooperation]{.mark}**" through bilateral and
multilateral **cooperation**]{.underline}. This includes [enhancing
Arctic states' efforts to create a unified regional search and rescue
system, prevent and respond [to]{.mark} humanitarian and
**[environmental emergencies]{.mark}**, coordinate the activities of
**rescue forces**, and ensure interaction of the Arctic states within
the framework of the Arctic Coast Guard
Forum]{.underline}.[[87]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR87) Overall,
Russia's strategy emphasizes that local socio-economic conditions must
improve dramatically to allow Russia to effectively exploit its natural
resources and bolster human security. Thus, [while Russia has
invested]{.underline} heavily [in building up its military]{.underline}
and "dual use" [infrastructure]{.underline} in its Arctic Zone, [it
concurrently demonstrates a **greater attentiveness** to threats and
challenges that emanate from the **non-military sphere**]{.underline}.
This latter set of challenges provides the foundation for its Arctic
Council chairmanship priorities for 2021--2023, [focused on economic,
social and environmentally **sustainable development**]{.underline} in
the Arctic
region.[[88]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR88) It
is telling that Canada articulated a similar emphasis during its last
chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 2013--2015---and
[[despite]{.mark} **international stresses** over the
**[Ukraine]{.mark}** crisis [managed]{.mark} [to **shelter** the forum
**politically** so]{.mark} that [it could continue its]{.mark} important
[work on **human** and **environmental**
security]{.mark}]{.underline}.[[89]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR89)

Rather than applying reductionist (and often outdated) definitions of
militarization that simply equate a larger military presence to the
probability of inter-state conflict, we encourage more deliberate
parsing of defence and security doctrines to identify those that do not
undermine regional stability or are conducive to regional cooperation.
While strategic competition has heightened tensions between
[Russia]{.underline} and Canada in the global sphere, [both maintain a
strong commitment to work with their circumpolar neighbours to ensure
that the Arctic remains a zone of **peace** and
**stability**]{.underline}. Strategic deterrence does not violate this
logic. Furthermore, increasing traffic and foreign presence in the
Arctic heightens regional safety and security concerns, blurring the
lines between defence and security, trade, investment, development,
economic, and foreign policy. [Investments in]{.underline} Arctic
[defence]{.underline} and security that [are designed to protect
sovereign **jurisdiction**, improve **domain awareness**, better respond
to **search and rescue** and emergencies, and enhance safe maritime
navigation do **not** represent an Arctic "arms race" or threaten the
**regional
order**]{.underline}.[[90]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR90) Although
resurgent strategic competition leaves the global geopolitical climate
uncertain, there remains little likelihood of conflict generated by
resource or boundary disputes, or governance issues in the Arctic. In
that region, observations or drivers associated with geostrategic
competition at the international systemic level should not be misapplied
to objective and subjective geographical assessments of
the regional Arctic security
environment.[[91]{.underline}](https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/3243/6567#FR91) Instead,

Taiwan has become a focal point for the U.S.-China conflict, with the
Pentagon turning its attention towards a hypothetical conflict with
China --- referring to it as the "sole pacing threat" --- and China
continuing combat and blockade drills around the island.

However, [despite China's demonstrations of military power, Taiwan's
unique economic niche and geographic position make it a particularly
thorny target for Beijing]{.underline}. The [Chinese Communist Party's
legitimacy rests largely on the robust economy]{.underline} it has
built, and [the direct economic repercussions of an invasion or blockade
of Taiwan stand to shatter the foundations of Beijing's domestic
power]{.underline}.

There are [three non-military conditions that make a full military
assault or blockade of Taiwan a nonviable option for the
CCP]{.underline}. First is the global importance of Taiwan's
semiconductor manufacturing base, second is the impact on trade and the
shipping industry running through the Taiwan Strait and Luzon Strait,
and third is China's own less-than-favorable economic conditions.

[The semiconductor issue]{.underline}

Taiwan is the largest manufacturer of semiconductors in the world. In
the fourth quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
(TSMC) ---Taiwan's largest producer of semiconductors --- took a 67.1%
market share of all chips globally, and produced nearly all of the most
advanced chips. [There is no viable replacement for Taiwan's
manufacturing in the semiconductor market; not only does the nation
represent a massive share of the chip industry, its infrastructure
uniquely supports the scale and quality of production]{.underline}.

[Semiconductors represent an irreplaceable enabler of global economic
activities. If Taiwan were to stop producing chips, both the American
and Chinese economies --- not to mention the world economy --- would
contract and ignite a global depression]{.underline}. Chips enable
electrical grids, manufacturing, home utilities, automobiles, and more;
they have permeated every facet of the global economy.

[Semiconductors]{.underline} are not an end in themselves, they [are a
means to an end, enabling innovation and emerging
technologies]{.underline} like AI and robotics. [Taiwan's dominance in
this critical market is referred to as its "silicon
shield]{.underline}," which means that the U.S. and China are invested
in protecting its output.

[An offensive or blockade against the island nation would have a
profound global economic impac]{.underline}t. The most important global
economies rely on the chips manufactured in Taiwan. With demand for
chips only growing, [losing Taiwan\'s manufacturing base could throttle
global supply chains for years to come]{.underline}.

Inefficacy of military action

Chinese [military action would disrupt the global commerce running
through the Taiwan and Luzon Straits]{.underline}. The straits on either
side of Taiwan are thoroughfares for international trade, with Taiwan's
own ports handling \$586 billion in trade in 2022, and an estimated
\$2.45 trillion transiting the strait in the same time period. Besides
Taiwan, China's ports are most likely to be impacted, with ships
diverting from the ports along China's eastern coast.

[While global shipping lanes can likely divert around a conflict zone
without significantly raising prices, China's role in maritime shipping
infrastructure means that conflict would have a direct negative impact
on some of China's most lucrative ports and port cities, with ships no
longer making stops along a broad swath of the coast]{.underline}.

Ships will not be able to access the extensive network of maintenance
and repair sites along the Chinese coast, as well as cargo processing
sites. The [loss of access to some of these ports would have knock-on
effects for the global shipping industry]{.underline} if there is a
protracted conflict or blockade, leaving remaining ports to deal with
the spillover.

Geopolitically, [China would have to reckon with the Global South and
BRICS nations, whose trade relies on the straits even more than the
G7]{.underline}. [Given that China is courting these nations
diplomatically, impeding their trade could set off a diplomatic fiasco
that Beijing would likely want to avoid]{.underline}.

Already poor economic conditions

[China is not in a strong economic position]{.underline} as it has been
reined in by the lingering aftereffects of its real estate crisis,
subdued domestic consumption, and the impacts and uncertainty created by
the trade war's tariffs. [Kicking off a global crisis would likely
exacerbate the economic issues it currently faces]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [Taiwan represents up to 60% of China's own chip imports.
If China attacks Taiwan it stands to cripple its own industries by
starving them of chips]{.underline}. Besides chips imports, the [PRC is
heavily dependent on trade]{.underline} --- comprising 37% of its GDP
--- [making it even more vulnerable to disruptions in global
trade]{.underline}.

According to a study done by Bloomberg Economics, [in the event of a
blockade, global GDP would be down 5%, with China and the U.S. seeing
shrinkage of 8.9% and 3.3%, respectively. And in the event of an
invasion, global GDP would be down 10.2%, with South Korea, Japan, and
other East Asian nations seeing the worst of the impact. The resulting
\$10 trillion price tag on merely the first year of the crisis
incentivizes the stakeholders to avoid confrontation]{.underline}. [If
any or all of Taiwan's foundries are destroyed, the impact would be even
greater and the economic depression would last for a decade or more as
nations attempt to build out their own profitable foundries. Not to
mention that this would likely create a permanent rift between China and
trade with the U.S. and the EU]{.underline}.

[While both China and the U.S. attempt to relieve their respective
reliance on Taiwanese chips through domestic production, Taiwan retains
its most advanced nodes on its territory in order to maintain global
dependence on its chips industry]{.underline}. Cajoling from both the
U.S. and China has brought TSMC investment and factories to both
nations, but [these nodes do not represent a viable replacement for
Taiwan's output]{.underline}.

Given these three factors, [China would have to be certain that it would
be able to take Taiwan quickly, and with minimal damage to the delicate
foundries and their personnel]{.underline}. [With]{.underline} an
[ongoing purge of the PLA due to corruption concerns, it seems there is
either widespread corruption or a political purge, both of which put a
damper on readiness]{.underline}. [If Xi's generals are corrupt that
means readiness isn't where it should be, if it's a political purge then
it impacts morale and cohesion]{.underline}.

[If Taiwan shapes itself into a high-stakes/low value target it can
remain largely untouchabl]{.underline}e because of the economic
structures surrounding it. These [economic shields could compound if
Taiwan engages in military strategies such as becoming a "porcupine," to
make itself a hard military target as well]{.underline} --- engaging in
anti-access/area denial strategies with high volumes of antiship
missiles, sea mines, and air defense systems.

Taiwan\'s main value to China is through its nationalistic claims to the
island. China's issue with Taiwanese independence also hinges on U.S.
assurances that it will not deny China access to the lagging edge chips
Taiwan's foundries export to China and that it will not separate the
island from the mainland.

As long as the island does not move towards independence and continues
to "porcupine," the [structural economic factors play to the island\'s
advantage, making it easier for the Chinese to ignore the situation, for
now, to maintain the favorable economic conditions of the
region]{.underline}.

\[need better cards for 2nc, could probably steal from other files tbh\]

The swirling uncertainty over whether the United States will get drawn
into a war between Israel and Iran is raising concerns about whether
China will take advantage of the chaos to start its invasion of Taiwan.

The rationale behind these concerns is straightforward.

With President Donald Trump's tariff war, the decoupling of the United
States and Chinese economies, and a potential Middle East conflagration
drawing American attention, China has little reason to hold back.

How accurate is this assessment?

We've been here before. The [narrative of an "imminent Chinese invasion
of Taiwan" has been floated for years]{.underline}.

I wrote an article criticising this narrative in 2022. And just as I
predicted, in 2025, [there still hasn't been an invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}.

In fact, [I consider it even less likely now that China will invade
Taiwan than I did in 2022]{.underline}.

To see why, let me first briefly summarise what I wrote back in 2022.
Then, I'll explain why I think an invasion is less likely now than it
was back then.

Why [Invading Taiwan Isn't Just Hard. It's Suicidal]{.underline}.

Back in 2022, I laid out why a full-scale invasion of Taiwan would be a
[logistical nightmare for China]{.underline}.

Doomsayers who argued that Beijing could "go for it" ignored a basic
reality: [invading Taiwan would require a level of effort from the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) equivalent to the Normandy D-Day
landings]{.underline}.

To achieve a successful invasion, the [PLA would need to coordinate a
massive movement of men and materiel over several months, all in full
view of surveillance satellites]{.underline}.

When (if) it happened[, creating a beachhead in Taiwan would be deadlier
than Normandy]{.underline}.

[Taiwan has been preparing for an invasion for decades]{.underline}. Its
military will use every inch of the island's mountainous terrain to turn
it into an impregnable fortress.

Launching [an invasion of Taiwan would be an all-in gamble for President
Xi]{.underline} Jinping. And Xi Jinping [didn't get to where he is today
by being an inveterate gambler]{.underline}.

Finally, I highlighted that [China's primary ambition is to regain its
millennia-long position as a pre-eminent global civilisation. Any
large-scale invasion would horrify the world, undoing China's
decades-long soft power efforts to rebuild its prestige]{.underline}.

Why would China throw away all its efforts on a hugely expensive
military adventure in Taiwan when it could bide its time, build its
reputation, and potentially merge with Taiwan peacefully?

[2025 Looks Different: War Looks Less Likely]{.underline} (Not More)

When I wrote my earlier article, I stopped short of making predictions
beyond 2024. The future looked too uncertain.

Now that we're halfway through 2025, I'm confident enough to say this.

[China will not invade Taiwan by 2027]{.underline}.

[Two major factors]{.underline} are behind my reassessment.

Firstly, I [overestimated the degree to which the PLA was prepared for
an invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.

Previously, I assumed that Chinese military capabilities were advancing
steadily. I thought that the PLA could mount an invasion. The ruinous
cost of such an invasion was the only thing stopping President Xi
Jinping from issuing the order.

I now realise that [the PLA's readiness may be in question]{.underline}.

[Secondly, I assumed that United States policy would remain
rational]{.underline}.

In 2022, the prospects of Donald Trump returning to the White House
seemed distant.

I didn't expect the American electorate would so willingly re-elect a
man whose bungling policies led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Americans in the early pandemic days.

But here we are today with Donald Trump firmly behind the Resolute desk.

Let's see how these [two factors combine to make a Chinese invasion of
Taiwan unlikely by 2027]{.underline}.

The People's Liberation Army is Unsure About The Feasibility of an
Invasion

Since 2022, there has been [significant turmoil in the upper echelons of
the PLA]{.underline}, suggesting considerable disagreement between PLA
factions.

[China has had three defense ministers in as many years]{.underline}.
[Two]{.underline} generals who previously served in this post [were
fired, investigated for corruption, and expelled from the Communist
Party]{.underline}.

The [removal of high-ranking ministers followed a purge of nine
generals, several of whom led the PLA Rocket Force, with operational
control of China's missile and nuclear capabilities]{.underline}.

Then, in November 2024, the axe fell on Admiral Miao Hua, a member of
the Central Military Commission and former close protege of Xi Jinping,
allegedly for "disciplinary violations."

Miao's defenestration ended his accelerated move up the ranks, which
began in 2014, thanks to his close relationship with Xi Jinping.

[Xi Jinping's willingness to purge erstwhile loyalists implies the top
ranks of the PLA are tainted with factionalism or
corruption]{.underline}.

[Bloomberg]{.underline} News has previously [cited intelligence reports
claiming that corruption is rife in the PLA. Several nuclear-capable
missiles were filled with water instead of fuel, while malfunctioning
silo lids could prevent the launch of ICBMs]{.underline}.

Whether the PLA is experiencing factionalism or corruption, or some
combination of both, the conclusion is the same.

President [Xi Jinping is less likely to contemplate military action than
would otherwise have been the case]{.underline}.

Donald Trump's Second Presidency is the Best Thing to Happen to China

However, it is [the return of Donald Trump to the White House that is a
more significant factor]{.underline} in necessitating the re-evaluation
of my initial assessment.

Simply put, Donald [Trump has been the greatest gift from the American
electorate that Xi Jinping could ever have hoped for]{.underline}.

Since taking office, Donald [Trump has damaged the United States'
primacy in international relations]{.underline} at every turn. He has
[gutted foreign aid, imposed tariffs on imports from every country, and
undermined NATO]{.underline}, amongst others.

[These actions alienate traditional US allies]{.underline}. They
[threaten to unravel the entire system of alliances that the United
States itself established]{.underline} post-World War 2.

While these moves might placate MAGA diehards, they also [invite other
powers to step into the vacuum created by the United States' hasty
retreat from global affairs]{.underline}.

Donald [Trump has been]{.underline} notably and inexplicably [hostile to
Western Europe]{.underline} --- the United States' oldest ally. Donald
Trump has been explicit in his desire to annex Greenland, a territory of
Denmark, which is a core member of the EU and NATO.

Donald Trump has also threatened 50% retaliatory tariffs on all EU
imports. These are not the acts of a friend.

And on the most pressing strategic question facing contemporary Europe
--- what to do with Russia --- Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his
admiration for Vladimir Putin.

Donald Trump may not be a Russian asset in the formal sense. But he sure
as hell comes across as a Putin fanboy.

Donald Trump's bizarre Russophilia has severely impacted European
opinion of America.

[More Europeans now view America as a "necessary partner with which we
must strategically cooperate" instead of an ally who shares Europe's
interests and values]{.underline}.

And we're still only six months into the second Donald Trump presidency.

But the increasingly negative view with which Europeans see the United
States means there is [less motivation for Europeans to do America's
bidding on issues that solely affect American interests]{.underline}.

Thus, the [relationship between Europe and the United States will become
more transactional]{.underline}. [This would open the door for
China]{.underline}, which is looking to expand its influence in Europe.

There's a good reason for Europe to pay attention to China's entreaties.

Europe is already China's biggest trading partner. Meanwhile, China is
Europe's second biggest trading partner after the United States.

China is trying to position itself as the stable and mature great power
alternative to the United States.

By realising their febrile isolationist dreams, Donald Trump and the
MAGA cultists are helping China achieve its long-held goal.

Final Thoughts

China is no more willing to invade Taiwan than it was in 2022.

In fact, I'd argue that [China is less willing to invade Taiwan in 2025
than it was in 2022]{.underline}.

Donald [Trump is the primary factor meriting this change]{.underline} in
assessment.

Trump's policies risk removing the United States from the global web of
alliances that have anchored the United States' position as the world's
sole superpower after the collapse of the Union.

The United States' removal from this global system is creating a void
that China will be happy to fill.

Xi Jinping's goal is clear. He wants to return China to what he sees is
its rightful position as a global civilisation.

In doing so, Xi Jinping wants to create an alternative to today's
American-centred world order.

Xi Jinping rose to the top of the Chinese political system with ruthless
calculation, not reckless gambling.

He won't throw away the advantage that Donald Trump is handing him on a
silver platter with an ill-considered invasion of Taiwan.

Wheeled Reason Russian Can\'t Win in Ukraine". Newsweek. 4-14-2025.
https://www.newsweek.com/four-more-wheeled-reason-russian-cant-win-ukraine-opinion-2058805

As the war in Ukraine grinds through its fourth year, [Russian military
might is a shadow of what it was on the eve of the
invasion]{.underline}. [Its mechanized forces, central to its strategies
for victory, are bleeding out and now include museum-grade military
trucks, civilian cars, vans, all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles \...
and even donkeys. This is not a force poised for victory]{.underline}.

[To win]{.underline}, by any rational definition of the term \"win,\"
[Russia must capture more of Ukraine than the 20 percent of the country
it currently occupies]{.underline}. [At the very least, Russia must
consolidate control over the biggest oblasts in eastern Ukraine: Donetsk
and Luhansk. It\'s still tens of miles away from achieving even this
modest aim]{.underline}.

[Advancing]{.underline} those tens of miles [is increasingly difficult
for the roughly half-million-strong Russian and North Korean force in
Ukraine]{.underline}---and only vanishingly likely as Russia\'s wider
war on Ukraine grinds into its 38th month.

And that\'s for one main reason. [The kinds of forces the Russian
military traditionally depends on]{.underline} for swift marches deep
into enemy territory [are becoming an endangered species]{.underline} on
the mine-seeded, artillery-pocked, drone-patrolled front line---700
miles or more from north to south---of the terrifically bloody wider
war.

[Russia\'s regiments and brigades of tanks, tracked fighting vehicles,
mobile howitzers, and lots and lots of supply trucks simply don\'t exist
anymore]{.underline}. For generations of Russian planners, \"the aim was
to penetrate \[the\] enemy front line and follow this with a powerful
mechanized second echelon that exploited the initial breakthrough,\"
Dutch army officer Randy Noorman wrote for West Point\'s Modern War
Institute.

Those plans may now be completely trampled by the wayside, now.

[Advancing]{.underline} many miles per day into the lightly defended
rear of the enemy\'s shattered front-line forces [requires protected
mobility. But that protected mobility may have been rendered largely
obsolete]{.underline} by weapons old and new: artillery and mines that
haven\'t changed very much in 100 years, and explosive drones that are
being deployed on a scale that practically no one imagined just a few
years ago.

Mines, artillery, and especially drones are now so dense along the front
line that [tanks and other armored vehicles \"simply don\'t reach the
line for launching an attack]{.underline},\" according to one Russian
military blogger. They get blown up miles from enemy positions.

While it\'s a problem that afflicts both sides, it vexes the Russians
more than it does the Ukrainians, because the [Russians cannot \"win\"
without gaining ground]{.underline}. By contrast, [merely containing
Russian and allied forces represents a significant victory for the
Ukrainians]{.underline}. Hold the Russians at their current positions
and Ukraine\'s government, economy, and culture---and potential for
future military action---would endure.

While it\'s true the Russians made meaningful gains in eastern Ukraine
early last year during an abrupt---and temporary---freezing of U.S. aid
that deprived Ukrainian forces of urgently needed ammunition, a year
later, the [Ukrainians have replenished their ammo stocks, secured new
European supply lines and even broken ground for new munitions factories
in Ukraine]{.underline} (though there is a recent report that one of
them has been destroyed). Even as American intransigence deepens under
President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, [Ukraine
is in a much better position to resist Russian attacks today than it
was]{.underline} in early 2024. [Every Russian attack meets a avalanche
of firepower]{.underline}.

The numbers tell the story. As the war lurched into its fourth year,
Russian losses of tanks, fighting vehicles and other heavy equipment had
exceeded 20,000, according to the analysts at the Oryx intelligence
collective, which confirms each loss with imagery from the front line.
That\'s more vehicles than the British military has in its entire
inventory.

New production adds just a few hundred fresh vehicles a month. The
[Russians have recovered thousands of Cold War vehicles from
rust-stained storage yards; but even these once-plentiful stocks are
running low]{.underline}. In 2022, Russia had 2,700 old MT-LB armored
tractors in storage. By now, it\'s already sent most of them to
Ukraine---and written off nearly 1,300 of them, according to Oryx.

As of last year, Russia intended \"to initiate further offensive
operations to make significant---if slow---gains on the battlefield,\"
according to Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, analysts with the Royal
United Services Institute in London. These gains were \"intended to be
used as leverage against Kyiv to force capitulation on Russian terms.\"

That didn\'t happen. And it\'s even less likely to happen this year or
next as Russian losses deepen.

The Issue

[Russian military forces have failed to effectively advance along
multiple axes in Ukraine, seized limited territory, lost substantial
quantities of equipment relative to Ukraine, and suffered remarkably
high rates of fatalities and casualties since January 2024]{.underline},
according to new CSIS data. While some policymakers and experts argue
that Russia holds "all the cards" in the Ukraine war, the [data suggests
that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the
battlefield]{.underline}.

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue
that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and
will likely triumph. As one U.S. academic contended, "the United States
and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over
Ukraine," and "the Russians are going to win."1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former
Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory
changes, "we will lose this war."2 In addition, some U.S. policymakers
have concluded that Russia has "all the cards."3

Not surprisingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin has boasted that
Russia is decisively winning on the battlefield: "Overall, we can
clearly see what is happening right now. Our troops have the strategic
initiative along the entire contact line." He continued that "we have
reason to believe that we are set to finish them off. I think that
people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on."4 Andrei Kartapolov,
head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia's lower legislative
chamber, followed Putin's comments with threats that if Ukraine did not
accede to Russia's maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian
leaders would be forced to listen to "the language of the Russian
bayonet."5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia's battlefield
performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military
been in achieving the Kremlin's objectives? What factors have
contributed to this outcome? To answer these questions, this assessment
examines several indicators of Russia's battlefield performance: the
relative rate of advance of Russian forces, the size of Russian
territorial gains, the scope of equipment losses, and fatality and
overall casualty rates. The evidence suggests that Russia has largely
failed to achieve its primary objectives and has suffered high costs.

Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark in the summer of
2025---a stunning and grisly milestone.

First, [Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters per
day in such areas as Kharkiv, slower than during the Somme offensive in
World War I]{.underline}, where French and British forces advanced an
average of 80 meters per day. Russian [rates of advance have also been
significantly slower than during such offensives as Galicia]{.underline}
in 1914 (1,580 meters per day), [Gorzia]{.underline} in 1916 (500
meters), [Belleau Wood]{.underline} in 1918 (410 meters),
[Leningrad]{.underline} in 1943 (1,000 meters), [and
Kursk-Oboyan]{.underline} in 1943 (3,220 meters). Even Russia's [rate of
advance in parts of Donetsk Oblast, averaging 135 meters per day, has
been remarkably slow]{.underline}.

Second, [Russia's seizure of approximately 5,000 square kilometers of
territory in Ukraine since January 2024 has been
paltry]{.underline}---amounting to [less than 1 percent of Ukrainian
territory]{.underline}---and has occurred mainly in Donetsk, Luhansk,
and Kharkiv Oblasts. Russia's margin[al gains are particularly
noteworthy compared to its conquest of 120,000 square kilometers during
the first five weeks of the war and Ukraine's recapture of 50,000 square
kilometers in the spring of 2022]{.underline}.

Third, [Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment across the
land, air, and sea domains]{.underline}, highlighting the sharp matériel
toll of its attrition campaign. Since January 2024, for example, Russia
has lost roughly 1,149 armored fighting vehicles, 3,098 infantry
fighting vehicles, 300 self-propelled artillery, and 1,865 tanks. Even
more noteworthy, [Russian equipment losses have been significantly
higher than Ukrainian losses]{.underline}, varying between a ratio of
5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine's favor.

Fourth, [Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary.
Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark in the summer of
2025]{.underline}---a stunning and grisly milestone. Overall, a high of
[250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total
Russian casualties,]{.underline} a sign of Putin's blatant disregard for
his soldiers. To put these numbers into historical perspective[, Russia
has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all
Russian and Soviet wars combined between the end of World War II and the
start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022]{.underline}. In
addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are
15 times larger than the Soviet Union's decade-long war in Afghanistan
and 10 times larger than Russia's 13 years of war in Chechnya.6

[Increased sanctions on Russia and continuing U.S. and European military
assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a
protracted war and could facilitate peace talks]{.underline}.

The Ukrainian invasion of Russia is now in its third month with little
indication that it will end any time soon. Despite a series of Russian
counterattacks since the invasion began on August 6, [Ukraine continues
to control an area of around one thousand square kilometers inside
Russia's Kursk Oblast]{.underline}.

[This unprecedented Ukrainian occupation of Russian territory has
revealed the limitations of the Kremlin war machine]{.underline}. While
many continue to view the Russian military as an irresistible force with
virtually limitless supplies of men and machines, it is now increasingly
apparent that in reality, [Putin's attempt to conquer Ukraine has left
his army dangerously overstretched and unable to defend
Russia]{.underline}.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had initially hoped that by
invading Russia, he could pressure Putin into transferring troops from
Ukraine to the home front. So far, this has not happened. Instead, the
Russian army has continued to advance steadily in eastern Ukraine and
has captured a number of towns and villages since Ukraine's cross-border
incursion began. At the same time, the fact that [Putin has had to
choose between the invasion of Ukraine the defense of
Russia]{.underline} is in itself telling.

Russia's [difficulties on the Kursk front are the latest indication that
Moscow is experiencing mounting manpower issues]{.underline}. In recent
months, the Russian [military has reportedly been forced to dramatically
increase the bounties on offer to new recruits]{.underline}. According
to investigative Russian news outlet Vyorstka, [those who do agree to
sign up to fight in Ukraine are now often in very poor
health]{.underline}, with the average age of volunteers rising from
forty at the start of the invasion to around fifty.

Other signs that Putin is being forced to scrape the bottom of the
barrel to replenish the depleted ranks of his army include recent
reports that [sailors from Russia's only aircraft carrier]{.underline},
the Admiral Kuznetsov, [have been withdrawn from naval service and
deployed to Ukraine as infantry]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} is
also in the process of [passing new legislation that will allow
defendants to sign military contracts and avoid prosecution. Tens of
thousands of Russian prisoners have already been released from jail to
fight in Ukraine]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, as Ukrainian troops crossed the border into the Kursk region
in early August, they found that [most of the Russian defenses in the
border zone were manned by young conscript troops who were soon
surrendering]{.underline} in large numbers. This has [allowed Ukraine to
replenish its exchange fund and conduct a number of prisoner
swaps]{.underline}, while also causing considerable disquiet within
Russian society.

Putin's uncharacteristically restrained reaction to Ukraine's Kursk
incursion suggests that he is well aware of his army's shortcomings. Far
from threatening World War III or attempting to rally his country
against the foreign invader, Putin has sought to downplay the entire
invasion, and has had remarkably little to say about what is the first
foreign occupation of Russian land since World War II.

This underwhelming response has been evident since the very first days
of Ukraine's offensive, which Putin initially dismissed as a mere
"provocation." The R[ussian media has reportedly been instructed by the
Kremlin to minimize the significance of the Ukrainian
invasion]{.underline}, and has been tasked with convincing domestic
audiences that the presence of Ukrainian troops inside Russia is now the
"new normal."

This does not mean that the Russian military is on the brink of
collapse, of course. On the contrary, Putin has recently unveiled
ambitious plans to further expand the size of his army to one and a half
million soldiers, a move that would make it the second largest in the
world after China. He can also announce a further round of mobilization
if necessary, but this could potentially fuel domestic unrest and
convince thousands of young Russians to flee the country.

[Putin will certainly need to find large numbers of additional troops as
he looks to compensate for Russia's staggering losses and achieve his
objective of gradually bleeding Ukraine to death in a brutal war of
attrition]{.underline}. According to US officials, September 2024 was
the bloodiest month of the war for Russian troops in Ukraine, but it was
also one of the most successful in terms of new territory seized. With
Russia now comfortably outnumbering and outgunning Ukraine, Putin is
clearly counting on his country's far greater capacity to absorb
battlefield casualties and keep fighting.

Ukraine's leaders seem to understand this grim arithmetic perfectly
well. Indeed, they appear to have taken the bold decision to invade
Russia in large part because they recognized that remaining locked in a
war of attrition with their much larger enemy would be an act of
national suicide.

Not everyone is convinced by the arguments in favor of the Kursk
operation, with some critics calling it a reckless gamble and a
strategic blunder that has weakened Ukraine's defenses at a critical
moment. Nevertheless, there is no denying that the offensive has
succeeded in challenging the previously prevailing narrative of
inevitable Russian victory. Crucially, the Ukrainian invasion of
Russia's Kursk region has also demonstrated that Putin's overextended
army is far more vulnerable than the Kremlin would like us to believe.

[NATO Secretary-General]{.underline} Mark [Rutte praised]{.underline}
President [Trump's commitment to the military alliance]{.underline}
during a recent interview and said the [president deserves credit for
pushing the 32-nation members to spend more]{.underline} of their gross
domestic product on defense.

Rutte, in an interview with The New York Times released Saturday, said
[he is "confident of the fact that Trump very much realizes that for the
U.S. to stay strong and safe, there is this embeddedness with European
security and working together to keep the Indo-Pacific
safe]{.underline}."

Rutte, who invoked the word "daddy" when celebrating Trump's f-bomb when
discussing Israel and Iran's ceasefire on live television, argued the
[president's leadership helped NATO allies commit to spending five
percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2035]{.underline}.

"I think [when somebody deserves praise]{.underline}, that [praise
should be given. And]{.underline} President [Trump deserves all the
praise, because without his leadership]{.underline}, without him being
re-elected president of the United States, the 2 percent this year and
the 5 percent in 2035 --- [we would never, ever, ever have been able to
achieve agreement on this]{.underline}," Rutte told the newspaper.

Trump has been pushing NATO allies to spend more on their military and
better share the burden of collective defense, arguing European nations
have not chipped in enough.

While members have committed to spending more on defense, some NATO
nations have not yet surpassed the 2 percent threshold set for 2014.

The president shared a private message from Rutte in June where the NATO
chief congratulated Trump on greenlighting U.S. strikes on Iran's three
crucial nuclear sites. In the message, [Rutte said Trump's decision
"makes us all safer]{.underline}."

In the message, Rutte, the former prime minister of the Netherlands,
said Trump was "flying into another big success in The Hague ... It was
not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent."

When asked if he minded that Trump made the text public ahead of this
summer's NATO summit, Rutte told The Times' Lulu Garcia-Navarro, "not at
all, because what was in the text message is exactly as I see it."

"One, that [he did an excellent job on Iran with the bombing of the
nuclear facility]{.underline}," the NATO head added. "And as I said in
that text message, [you are now flying into another big
success,]{.underline} which is a NATO summit, which will commit to 5
percent defense spending, and this is transformational."

Introduction

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began as an alliance
during the Cold War to oppose the Soviet Union. Despite the fall of the
USSR in 1991, [NATO's continuity has led to much debate among scholars
as to its purpose and relevance today]{.underline}. An organization that
started with only 12 member states, has grown to a become a strong
network of 30 members, with more states acting as important global
partners. W[hile NATO represents some of the biggest western powers, it
is also marked by operational failures and internal
disparities]{.underline}. Now the question for this research essay is:
has NATO truly been a success?

This question is worth exploring from different angles. To find an
answer, one [must look at the military interventions and activities that
NATO has carried out since 1991]{.underline}. This paper will primarily
look at NATO's three most significant interventions in Kosovo, Libya,
and Afghanistan. While two of these have been successes in the larger
picture, the [large opportunity costs are often overlooked]{.underline}.
And that is what this piece seeks to explore.

NATO: Origins and Objectives

While countering Soviet expansion is its main goal, NATO member states
have also highlighted two other priorities: (1) revival of nationalist
militarism in Europe through a strong North American presence on the
continent and (2) encouraging European political integration. Communism
was becoming a threat in Europe as governments like that of the Czech
Republic were overthrown by rebels. Considering many factors, it was
time for a more integrated and like-minded organization of nations to
uphold democratic values. The North Atlantic Treaty was enforced in 1949
and mainly laid the foundation for military and political cooperation
between its member states.

A fundamental aspect of the treaty lies in Article 5, which states that
an attack against one member is an attack against all . But NATO has
also shown the same level of support for nations expressing their desire
to become member states. For instance, the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict
has seen strong participation by NATO members as Ukraine aspired to join
it. Moreover, the conflict threatened the stability of Europe as a
whole, thereby prompting a response from NATO.

NATO's Operations: A List Marked By Failures?

NATO has a long list of military interventions in other states with hits
and misses. This section will look at four major NATO interventions and
their consequences.

The Yugoslavian Bombing, (1999)

The conflict in the Balkans worsened as Serbia increased its embargos on
Kosovan separatists and Albanian civilians. NATO established the Kosovo
Force (KFOR) [in 1999]{.underline} as a part of UNSC Resolution 1244
which mandated international presence in the region to mitigate the
conflict. As the Yugoslavians resisted, [NATO carried out a 78-day air
bombing]{.underline}, formalizing the KFOR's entry into the region. The
biggest [debate here is whether NATO's actions were humane]{.underline}.
Although it achieved its larger goal of stopping Milosevic and
separating Kosovo (de facto), the air [bombing caused more than 500
civilian deaths]{.underline}. There was an [exodus of refugees and the
fundamental pillars of the Responsibility to Protect were broken because
the people did not receive complete protection]{.underline}.

Determining whether NATO's actions in Kosovo were truly a success or
failure depends on what an individual considers more important: the ends
or the means. However, in the 21st century, when international
organizations are seen as important bodies that represent major
interests at a global level, [concerns must be solved through dialogue,
with force only being used as a last resort]{.underline}. In that sense.
NATO's mistakes in Kosovo seem to overshadow its successes.

The War in Afghanistan, (2001-2021)

The [intervention in Afghanistan is arguably one of NATO's most
important ones]{.underline}. After the 9/11 attacks, the US sent forces
to Afghanistan to capture Osama Bin Laden and bring the nation back to
democracy after five years of Taliban rule. The US, along with its NATO
allies, sent forces to Afghanistan under a UN Security Council mandate.
[Despite fulfilling both goals of overthrowing the Taliban regime and
killing Bin Laden, NATO (primarily US) troops continued to stay in
Afghanistan till 2021]{.underline}. Interestingly, the [US government
published]{.underline} an official document of a Congress hearing on
'The U.S. Lessons Learned in Afghanistan', which entailed [a list of its
intelligence and political failures that led to withdrawal]{.underline}.
Despite its fragility, the only reason that the Afghan government was
able to sustain itself was because of the support of NATO forces. Things
took a turn for the worse when then-president Donald Trump signed an
agreement with the Taliban in 2020 to withdraw troops by 2021.

While Donald Trump's actions may be justified from a 'US national
interest' perspective, the larger interests of the Afghan people were
compromised. American and NATO soldiers had indeed been there for twenty
years, only to be brought back during the country's toughest time. The
[withdrawal of troops led to an immediate fall in the Ghani
government]{.underline} which had to concede defeat instantly. [Despite
twenty long years, one of the most powerful alliances was brought down,
leading to its NATO biggest and most shocking security
failure]{.underline}.

The Intervention of Libya, (2011)

While there is [much debate on whether the NATO intervention in Libya
was a success]{.underline}, it is [important]{.underline} not just [to
look at]{.underline} the conflict itself, but [its aftermath as
well]{.underline}. Muammar Gadaffi's [Libya was an epicentre of tyranny
and human rights violations]{.underline}. As a part of the
Responsibility to Protect, the international community had to act. Once
again, the result was the victory of NATO forces and the fall of the
Gadaffi regime. But the US-led [NATO which was supposed to be a 'beacon'
of democratic values, was not entirely true to its purpose of protecting
the civilian population of Libya. While NATO's main target was the
Gadaffi regime, it did not emphasize enough combating rebel groups which
were equally dangerous]{.underline}.

Libyan [rebel groups were responsible for many civilian murders,
robberies, and war crimes]{.underline}. The rebels even killed civilians
who merely supported the Gadaffi regime but did no crime. [As per the
first pillar of the R2P, protection applies to the 'population' of a
nation, which includes every individual residing in the
nation]{.underline}. The UN and [NATO forces failed to protect a large
section of the population]{.underline}. Therefore, while NATO managed to
protect those fighting against Gadaffi, it still failed in other areas,
leading to another civil war despite an end to Gadaffi's regime.

NATO's Internal Differences

While the previous section primarily focused on the operational and
military failures of NATO, this section is going to explore the
administrative issues among NATO members which further complicate its
functioning. While NATO has always seemed to present a united front on
the global stage, there is no denying that nations and leaders within
the organization have fundamentally different views on how it should
function.

Turkey vs Greece: An Ongoing Feud

Greece-Turkey relations are historical and have been a source of
controversy for almost two hundred years. While both joined NATO in 1949
and 1952 respectively, there was hope that their conflict would subside.
Two main points of contention between both states are control over the
maritime domain in the eastern Mediterranean region and the Cyprus
conflict. Affairs took a turn for the worse with the election of Recep
Tayyip Erdogan as Turkey's president. Erdogan's emphasis on military
power and a hardline stance in East Mediterranean has only added to the
fire. [NATO has spent a significant amount of time and resources in
solving the conflict between these nations.]{.underline} Although it was
able to avert the Cyprus crisis in 1974, it [has failed to propose a
long-term solution to end tensions]{.underline}. Today, Erdogan's
[Turkey seems to be moving away from NATO toward Russia]{.underline}. In
many ways, [this has challenged the influence of other NATO members to
hold the alliance together]{.underline}.

Divisions in 2022: The Ukraine Conflict

As this paper is written, NATO faces one of its biggest challenges in
Ukraine against Russia. [While Ukraine is not a NATO member, its
inclination to join the latter was a defining factor in Russia launching
an attack]{.underline}. As Ukraine is important to regional stability in
Europe, NATO has enough incentive to act without direct intervention in
the war. Now, the fact that Ukraine has stood its ground against Russia
for two months is commendable. But [even in this conflict, NATO seems
divided]{.underline}.

While it is true that matters would only worsen if NATO directly
intervened, [the actions of each member state convey different
intentions]{.underline}. For instance, the [US's stance on banning
Russian oil and sanctioning its rival has been clear from the
beginning]{.underline}, but the [EU's position is
different]{.underline}. Russia's Nord Stream II pipeline is as important
for the EU as it is for Russia. Banning it would lead to an economic
disaster for the region. Additionally, the [EU's dependence on Russia
for its energy needs is high]{.underline}. US's [sanctions have only
raised energy prices which are now impacting civilians as
well]{.underline}. [NATO members have also been unsuccessful in creating
a no-fly zone on Ukraine, fearing escalation of the conflict. NATO's
idea of 'no direct intervention' has backfired as Russia is still aware
of NATO's indirect involvement]{.underline} and the former's attempts
continue despite Ukraine's willingness to stay away from NATO in
exchange for its sovereignty.

**3\-\--NATO is still plagued with problems**

//noah

This week's NATO summit in Washington is, by any measure, a grand
affair, full of the pomp and ceremony befitting the bloc's 75th
anniversary. It also offers up a useful opportunity to reflect on the
state of the most successful military alliance in history.

[On the surface, the verdict is positive]{.underline}. Today, the
[Alliance appears to once again be on the march]{.underline}, thanks
largely to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin's 2022 invasion
of Ukraine, and the bloody war of aggression it has waged against Kyiv
since, has breathed new life into a bloc that just a few years ago was
being written off by its own leaders as "brain dead."

Over the past two-and-a-half years, the practical necessities of
protecting Ukraine have jump-started conversations across the European
continent about a reinvigorated defense-industrial base. In response to
the specter of further Russian aggression, the bloc has increased its
operational tempo, interoperability and area of military operations. And
it has expanded, adding two members (Sweden and Finland) that eschewed
their traditional neutrality to seek the protection from Moscow's
imperial designs offered by collective defense. As a result, the NATO
alliance is now more dynamic and robust than at any time in recent
memory.

[Dig a bit deeper, though, and some serious internal contradictions
become visible]{.underline}.

The [first is the Alliance's lingering "free rider"
problem]{.underline}. For years, [U.S. officials have struggled to get
NATO members to shoulder their fair share of the financial burden for
collective defense]{.underline}. [A decade ago]{.underline}, at its
summit in Wales, [the bloc formally announced a "defence investment
pledge]{.underline}" committing each member to increase defense spending
to 2% of national GDP. (That commitment was reaffirmed at last year's
Alliance gathering in Vilnius).

Significant progress has been made on that score in recent years,
largely---though European officials may be loath to admit it---as a
result of political pressure during the Trump era. As Marc Thiessen
notes in the Washington Post, Trump's policies, however unartfully
expressed, "put Germany and the rest of NATO on notice: The United
States would no longer tolerate their failure to contribute adequately
to our common defense."

The results have been notable. When tallied last year, 11 of the
Alliance's then-31 members were found to be meeting the Wales criteria,
up from just 3 in 2014. Since then, concern over Ukraine's defense has
led to further investments, and 23 NATO member states are on track to
meet the 2% target this year.

Still, a number of [countries remain conspicuous
underperformers]{.underline}. According to NATO's own statistics, [six
nations]{.underline} (Canada, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Belgium and
Spain) [spend less than 1.5% of their GDP on defense, and two
others]{.underline}---Croatia and Portugal---[are nominally better but
still under the Wales goal]{.underline}. [Such a state of affairs is
unacceptable at a time when]{.underline}, as some experts have
convincingly argued, [mounting global challenges require Alliance
members not only to meet previous targets but to invest still more on
collective defense and deterrence]{.underline}.

The [second problem]{.underline} plaguing the Alliance [is the
trajectory of its only Middle Eastern member, Turkiye]{.underline}.
During the decades of the Cold War, Turkiye played an indispensable role
in safeguarding the bloc's southeastern flank against Soviet
encroachment. But in the post-Cold War era, [shifting
policies]{.underline} on the part of the country's long-serving
strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, [have made Turkiye the Alliance's most
grudging member---and arguably its weakest strategic link]{.underline}.

Today, it's easy to forget that [NATO cohesion was sorely tested by
Ankara's policies in the not-so-distant past]{.underline}. [For roughly
a year, Turkish opposition to Sweden's accession effectively deadlocked
Alliance politics]{.underline}. The impasse was only broken last summer,
after Erdogan successfully wrangled a series of political and strategic
concessions from Stockholm, as well as from Washington.

[More troublesome still is Turkiye's larger strategic
outlook]{.underline}, which increasingly [views itself as separate from
the West]{.underline}. Earlier this month, [Erdogan]{.underline}
traveled to Astana, Kazakhstan, where he [told Chinese president Xi
Jinping in no uncertain terms that his country has aspirations to join
the Moscow- and Beijing-dominated Shanghai Cooperation Organization as a
full member]{.underline}. If Erdogan gets his wish, [Turkiye will
simultaneously be a member of an alliance intended to safeguard the
West, and one that]{.underline} (as Xi and Putin have made all too
clear) [was built to oppose it]{.underline}.

Chances are, these subjects won't receive much attention at the NATO
summit. Much of this week's deliberations will doubtless be taken up by
discussions over America's future role in the Alliance in the wake of
President Joe Biden's disastrous late June debate performance and the
mounting political momentum of his Republican rival, former President
Donald Trump. Hopefully, however, officials will also find time to focus
on the bloc's lingering internal contradictions. Because, as much as
anything else, [those factors will help shape the future effectiveness
of the Alliance]{.underline}.

**[Geopolitical [rivalries are intensifying]{.mark} in the Arctic [but
Russia is willing to cooperate]{.mark}]{.underline}** with foreign
partners, **[including from the West, in economic ventures there that
will benefit all sides]{.underline}**, Russian President Vladimir Putin
said on Thursday.

In a major speech, Putin said U.S. President Donald Trump\'s stated
intention to acquire Greenland was \"serious\", and it was clear that
the U.S. would continue to promote its interests in the Arctic. **[The
Greenland question had nothing to do with Russia]{.underline}**, he
said.

But Moscow was concerned that \"NATO **[[countries]{.mark} in general
[are increasingly designating the]{.mark} far [north as a
springboard]{.mark} for possible conflicts, [practicing the use of
troops]{.mark} in these conditions]{.underline}**, including by their
\'new recruits\', Finland and Sweden,\" he said, referring to the
alliance\'s latest members.

Russia was monitoring the situation and building a response,
**[[including]{.mark} by boosting its [military capabilities in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

\"**[[We will not allow encroachments on the sovereignty]{.mark} of our
country [and will reliably protect our national interests]{.mark},\"
Putin said]{.underline}**.

Focus on the Arctic\'s strategic importance for mining, shipping and
security has increased sharply because of repeated statements by Trump
that he wants to acquire Greenland. He has not ruled out doing so by
force.

**[The Arctic [holds fossil fuels]{.mark} and minerals beneath the land
and the seabed [that could become more accessible]{.mark} with global
warming]{.underline}**. It is also an area of military competition,
where defense analysts say **[[Russia]{.mark} has [built]{.mark} up its
[presence much faster]{.mark} than the West [by reopening]{.mark}
Soviet-era [bases]{.mark} and modernizing its navy.]{.underline}**

**[The United States sees the Arctic as crucial for natural
security]{.underline}**, including for its early warning system against
nuclear attacks.

The Kremlin says **[the Arctic is a zone of Russian strategic
interest]{.underline}**, and suggested in February that **[Russia and
the U.S. could work together to develop natural resources there as the
two countries pursue a fast-moving rapprochement that has unnerved
Ukraine and its European allies]{.underline}**.

**[NORTHERN SEA ROUTE]{.underline}**

On the economic front, **[[Putin]{.mark} has [made it a top priority to
ramp up]{.mark} commerce via [the]{.mark} Northern Sea Route
([NSR]{.mark}]{.underline}**) through Arctic waters as **[[Russia
shifts]{.mark} trade [towards Asia]{.mark} and away from Europe [because
of]{.mark} Western [sanctions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Oil shipments from
Russian ports to China via the NSR rose by a quarter last year.

**[Foreign partners prepared to cooperate with Russia on investment
projects in the region would be guaranteed a good return]{.underline}**,
Putin said.

**[[He called for]{.mark} an [expansion of Russia\'s]{.mark} northern
[ports]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the building of a merchant fleet in
the Arctic, supported by new-generation icebreakers including
nuclear-powered ones.

But he said Russia\'s domestic capabilities were insufficient for this
at the moment, and that it would also require buying vessels and
interacting with foreign shipbuilders.

**[[Russia was already]{.mark} successfully [shipping oil and]{.mark}
[l]{.mark}iquefied [n]{.mark}atural [g]{.mark}as [via the
NSR]{.mark}]{.underline}**, he said.

\"**[[Now we need to create conditions for]{.mark} the [growth]{.mark}
of effective domestic operators that will engage in transporting
containers of coal, bulk and other cargo through the
Arctic]{.underline}**. We are also open here to the creation of joint
ventures,\" he added.

**[International logistics firms could supply capital, technology and
merchant ships to support this]{.underline}**, he said.

Putin delivered his speech to a conference on the Arctic in Murmansk, a
port from which the NSR runs eastward across the top of Russia to the
Bering Strait near Alaska.

He said Murmansk\'s port capacity should be at least trebled in the
coming years, with construction of new terminals and railway links, and
\"partners\" from Belarus, China, the United Arab Emirates and other
countries were showing interest in this project.

**[It is one of the key economic engines of Russia\'s

Alexey Chekunkov, Minister for the Development of the Far East and the
Arctic

In comparison the state of Alaska accounts for only 0.3 percent of U.S.
GDP. In neighboring Canada that figure is 0.5 percent for the three
northern territories.

\"The Arctic is a geostrategic territory on a global scale. It is one of
the key economic engines of Russia\'s development," said Alexey
Chekunkov, Minister for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic,
in remarks last week.

Earmarked investments

"**[As]{.underline}** the **[projects]{.underline}** that have already
begun **[are implemented, the importance of the Arctic in the
economy]{.underline}**, logistics and national security **[of Russia
will only increase]{.underline}**," he continued.

Russia has earmarked investments of \$40bn over the next decade to
create an economic environment to ensure implementation of all proposed
projects.

If the government can meet those significant financial investments,
however, remains to be seen.

President Putin's lofty goals of reaching 80 million tons of cargo along
the route by 2024 did not materialize, with the total tonnage only
coming in at slightly less than half of that figure last year.

"The government's central task is to ensure such conditions for the life
and work of people in the Arctic that all plans for the development of
the macro-region come true," Chekunkov concluded.

**[Shipping generates revenue]{.underline}**

**[The development of infrastructure along the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}**, including ports and nuclear-powered icebreakers
ensuring year-round access, **[will be key to implementing the economic
plan.]{.underline}**

Russia recently commissioned its eighth nuclear icebreaker, the largest
fleet it has ever operated, exceeding previous records set during the
height of the Cold War. By 2030 the fleet is set to encompass ten
vessels.

**[Shipping traffic associated with oil and liquefied natural gas
projects]{.underline}** **[along the Northern Sea Route also generates
substantial revenue]{.underline}** for Rosatomflot, operator of the
country's nuclear icebreaker fleet.

High fees

**[Fees for large oil tankers and LNG carriers can reach between
\$300,000 -- \$700,000 for a single escort]{.underline}**, depending on
the size of the vessel, the distance traveled and the time of year. In
2024 Atomflot provided escorts to 976 vessels.

doctrine. **[Russian control over the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}**,
which runs through Arctic waters along Russia's northern coast and
serves as the shortest shipping route between Europe and the Pacific,
**[is vital for the Kremlin's plans.]{.underline}** With this in mind,
**[Putin is currently prioritizing an enlarged and modernized military
presence]{.underline}** in the Arctic region including enhanced naval
capabilities.

**[Moscow sees the Northern Sea Route as part of Russia's national
transport infrastructure]{.underline}** **[and has sought to control
access for shipping from other nations]{.underline}**. This is
particularly controversial as the Northern Sea Route covers a vast area
that is expected to become increasingly navigable in the coming years
due to changing environmental conditions. Some of the areas currently
claimed by the Kremlin are situated well beyond the territorial waters
of the Russian Federation.

**Shipping reaches record high and is used to carry key Russian LNG
assets --- including the shadow fleet.**

**[Arctic [shipping in]{.mark} the Russian-controlled Northern Sea Route
([NSR]{.mark}) is [poised for]{.mark} major [growth]{.mark} this
year]{.underline}**, with a record number of vessels applying for
**[permits. Voyages in NSR are [open in]{.mark} the [warmer
months]{.mark}, during the summer and autumn from July 1 to November 30,
when the ice has receded or has thinned.]{.underline}**

With navigation in the route set to open next month, the
state-controlled nuclear energy firm Rosatom said that it is
**[[expecting]{.mark} a [50 percent rise in voyages]{.mark} by foreign
vessels this year]{.underline}**. Rosatom controls the Russian
icebreaker fleet and is in charge of operations along the NSR.

"There is a clear upward trend in international interest in NSR. In
2025, foreign companies are expected to conduct at least 1.5 times more
voyages through NSR compared to the previous year," Rosatom told
Reuters.

Rosatom added that **[as of May 27, 196 applications had been submitted
for vessel navigation along NSR, including vessels sailing under foreign
flags. The [bulk of]{.mark} the [fleet]{.mark} will be vessels
[transporting]{.mark} liquefied gas from the Russian Arctic gas projects
such as the Yamal [LNG]{.mark} and Arctic LNG 2]{.underline}**. For the
summer navigation, around 30 LNG carriers have been granted permits to
transit NSR. However, there are concerns that at least five sanctioned
carriers are part of this list, according to the NSR Administration
registry under Rosatom.

With the West tightening economic sanctions against Russia, there **[has
been a [rise of shadow fleet]{.mark} exporting sanctioned Russian oil
and gas to international markets]{.underline}**. In the Baltic Sea, the
shadow fleet is seen as a threat to maritime safety in the region, with
several reports of sabotage operations on the undersea cable
infrastructure.

The opening of the NSR in the coming weeks is likely to see some of the
shadow fleet shift to the route. Russia has been marketing NSR as
shorter than the Suez Canal route, reducing travel time between Europe
and Asia. However, expansion of the icebreaker fleet and Arctic port
infrastructure is needed to make the route competitive.

**[Last year, [NSR hit a record cargo volume]{.mark} of 38 million tons,
up from 35 million tons in 2023.]{.underline}**

**Putins intentions are [clear]{.underline} --- an encroachment on the
NSR crowds out influence and forces escalation.**

Institute, 2018, ("U.S. military warns against Russian Arctic
expansion," Arctic Today, Mar 23^rd^, Available Online at

**[Researchers]{.underline}** have since the end of the Cold War
**[supported the idea that the Arctic is a peaceful region of
cooperation removed from global political dynamics and
conflicts]{.underline}**. The Arctic Council, a key intergovernmental
organization working on the Arctic, was even nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize earlier this year. However, **[recently Arctic
[exceptionalism has been increasingly]{.mark} challenged]{.underline}**.

"**[We have chosen to re-interpret Russian behavior and further the myth
of Arctic exceptionalism]{.underline}**," explains Huebert. "**[[It's an
illusion to think]{.mark} that as [Putin]{.mark} moves into an even more
authoritative regime we [can continue working together]{.mark} in the
Arctic on a cooperative basis]{.underline}**. Authoritative regimes
don't function that way."

"Call it what you want, but **[[Russia is serious about]{.mark} the
[militarization]{.mark}, remilitarization, or securitization of the
Arctic]{.underline}**." Huebert points out that the **[[revival
of]{.mark} air and land [bases, officially for search and rescue
purposes]{.mark},]{.underline}** also have runway capacities to handle
Russia's bomber and fighter fleets.

Concerns were also voiced by General Scaparrotti with regards to the
Northern Sea Route: "**[[Russia also intends to assert sovereignty over
the NSR]{.mark} in violation of the provisions of the United Nations
Convention of the Law of the Sea]{.underline}** (UNCLOS)." He warned
"**[if you look at what they're putting into place, [they would have the
capability]{.mark}, in perhaps two or three years, [to control the
route]{.mark}, if they chose to do so]{.underline}**."

While Russia's footprint in the Arctic, both economically and
militarily, has expanded rapidly, it hardly comes as a surprise, says
Huebert. **[[Existing policy]{.mark} and strategy documents [clearly lay
out Russia's intentions in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"In its 2008 Arctic Strategy Russia announced its plans to enhance its
military presence in the Arctic in order to guarantee the country's
sovereignty and protection of its borders. **[The re-establishment of
Soviet military bases represents a continuation of this
policy]{.underline}**," confirms Filimonova.
