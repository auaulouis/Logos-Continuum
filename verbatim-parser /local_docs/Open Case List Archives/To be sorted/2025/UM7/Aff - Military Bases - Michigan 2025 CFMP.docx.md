military logistics, domain awareness, and this file is large. We will
likely turn out an addendum, but there is a ton that the camp has

[Maritime [trade channels essential for America's]{.mark} globalized
[economy lie in]{.mark} the crossfire of [security]{.mark}
[threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} Examples abound: in the Middle East,
[[Iran]{.mark} has [seized]{.mark} [ships]{.mark} passing
[through]{.mark} the Strait of [Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline} and has
employed Houthi rebels as proxies in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait to target
commercial vessels and disrupt trade. The [[Suez]{.mark} [Canal
is]{.mark} [threatened]{.mark} by the spillover of regional instability
with the Israel-Hamas]{.underline} war, while the [Strait of
[Malacca]{.mark} is [dominated]{.mark} and increasingly militarized
[by]{.mark} [Beijing]{.mark}. **The common denominator is clear: [global
trade]{.mark} [routes are under siege and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [must look for]{.mark} feasible [alternatives]{.mark}.**
The United States may [turn]{.mark} its [attention]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the North for alternative trade routes: The Northern Sea Route
([NSR]{.mark}) and Northwest Passage (NWP)]{.underline}. These trade
routes are gaining strategic relevance with the ever faster recession of
the Arctic ice shield. [The United States is an Arctic power; its direct
access to the region and national security objectives in the Arctic give
the United States a say in the region's future.]{.underline} However,
[when it comes to the [NSR]{.mark} [and NWP, passages used]{.mark} and
administered [by Russia and Canada,]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [U.S. is
dependent on international coop]{.mark}eration [and can only access the
existing Arctic trade routes through international
partnerships.]{.mark}]{.underline} While these routes are already faster
than the Suez or Panama Canal, [ice melt from global [warming will
open]{.mark} an even more efficient [Transpolar Sea Route]{.mark} (TSR)
by mid-century.]{.underline} This [**[presents a unique geostrategic
opportunity]{.mark}**, for which [many nations will compete]{.mark}.
[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must enter this competition
and]{.mark} seek [to capitalize on the economic potential of trans-polar
trade.]{.mark} Russia already has a formidable military presence in the
region and has a major economic and strategic interest in the
TSR.]{.underline} Moscow continues to push military capabilities closer
to the North Pole, laying claim to the TSR before it opens up ice-free
for international use in the next few decades.

#### Trade chokepoints will occur - they have a unique strategic ability which must be obtained now

\*\*\*Definition - Chokepoints are a narrow passage of water where
forces can only enter one-by-one

[[The U.S.]{.mark} Government has [identified Russia's]{.mark}
[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute [as a]{.mark}n emerging
and **[critical choke point]{.mark}** [in international shipping
that]{.mark} could [reshape global trade]{.mark} patterns.]{.underline}

As [the region\'s waters become ice-free for longer periods, the
[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [P]{.mark}assage offers a shortcut
between Europe and Asia, [reducing travel time and fuel]{.mark}
consumption]{.underline}," the Federal Maritime Commission writes.

The commission is an independent agency of the government regulating
oceanborne transportation.

The FMC further points out that the [[opening]{.mark} of [the Arctic to
shipping]{.mark} ["has sparked competition]{.mark} over governance, with
Russia [seeking control over the shortest maritime route between Europe
and Asia]{.mark}, and imposing fees, while other [nations push for
international access]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[The U.S. has thus far not sent any commercial vessels through the
Arctic or along Russia's Northern Sea Route]{.underline}. Two summers
ago the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy traveled adjacent to the NSR
but remained outside Russia's exclusive economic zone and territorial
waters.

In contrast [commercial shipping companies from both Russia and China
have gained substantial experience on how to operate in the
region.]{.underline}

The two countries have also collaborated on joint Arctic patrols,
including in proximity of Alaska during the summer of 2024 as well as in
the Barents Sea near Norway.

"[The **[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [P]{.mark}assage[\'s strategic
importance]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} further **[amplified by]{.mark}
increased [military activity from]{.mark} [Russia and China]{.mark},**
including new bases and icebreakers]{.underline}," the FMC writes.

The research into the [[NSR is part of]{.mark} a larger study by the
agency into [seven global choke points]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the
Suez and Panama Canals as well as Straits in Gibraltar and Singapore.

Increasing stakes in Arctic

Some [Arctic logistics and security [experts]{.mark}]{.underline} have
long [[argue]{.mark}d that [the]{.mark} strategic [importance of
emerging Arctic]{.mark} [shipping lanes is set to
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The FMC is calling for public comment on the study by May 13, 2025. The
inclusion of the [[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} into this broad
investigation into international [[**maritime chokepoints**
continues]{.mark} the recent surge of Arctic policy interest in the
U.S.]{.underline}

For much of the past six months President Donald Trump's comments on
Greenland, including visits by one of his sons and Vice President JD
Vance, have perpetually kept the Arctic in the country's news cycle.

While Greenland's mineral wealth is often front and center as to why
[Trump is interested in the territory]{.underline}, others point to the
island's central location [along potential future Arctic shipping
routes.]{.underline}

As the sea ice continues to recede, [a central Arctic shipping route,
referred to as the Transpolar Sea Route, passing along the east coast of
Greenland, could emerge.]{.underline}

The FMC also references the [recent [increase in]{.mark} naval military
[activity along]{.mark} Arctic trade [routes]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"\[This\] is [[reflect]{.mark}ing its growing [value for]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} and missile defense. As a result, both **Russia and
NATO forces are ramping up their military presence**, increasing the
potential for tensions and conflicts,]{.underline}" the FMC concludes.

#### Russia and China are [pouncing]{.underline} on opening Arctic routes, with [destabilizing consequences]{.underline} for the region.

[Climate changes have meant the **melting** of ice in the Arctic and the
[**opening** of new sea routes]{.mark}, which [means **new
opportunities** for commerce and resource **exploitation**, but also
**increased risk** ]{.mark}to nations whose borders were previously
protected by the region\'s **inaccessibility**.]{.underline}

\"[Climate change is **fundamentally altering** the Arctic]{.underline},
and with it, geopolitics and U.S. defense missions,\" Hicks said. \"The
readiness of our forces for those missions is always foremost on our
minds, and that\'s why for decades, across Republican and Democratic
administrations, the department has been seeking to ensure our military
capabilities can meet the mark, even in the face of a changing
climate.\"

[Climate change and the shifts in the operating
environment]{.underline}, Hicks said, [mean [the U.S. must]{.mark}
**rethink** how to protect warfighters and [**prevent**
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The People\'s Republic of [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, not an Arctic
nation, [[is increasing its **presence** in the
Arctic]{.underline}.]{.mark} [The [PRC]{.mark} [operates three
**icebreakers**]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, for instance,
[[and]{.mark} [has a **military presence**]{.mark} there]{.underline} as
well. [The Chinese military has [also demonstrated its ability to
**operate**]{.mark} in the Arctic [by conducting **operations**]{.mark}
with the **Russian navy**]{.underline}, for instance.

\"[While not an **Arctic state**, the [PRC seeks **greater
influence**]{.mark} in the region, greater **[access]{.mark}** to the
region, [and]{.mark} a greater [**say** in its
**governance**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Hicks said. \"[That\'s
**concerning** given that it\'s the only **strategic competitor** with

[[Russia\'s presence]{.mark} in the Arctic[, including its **military
presence**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[the **largest** of all]{.mark}
Arctic [nations]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[can hold U.S. and
allied]{.mark} territories [at **risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the

\"[Russia continues to [pose an]{.mark} **acute [threat]{.mark}** [to

**excessive claims** over Arctic waters]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\"]{.mark}

[Russia is also **partnering** with China]{.underline}, Hicks said, and
this presents additional concerns for U.S. defense.

\"[We\'ve seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, commercially, [with the PRC being a **major**
funder of Russian **energy exploitation** in the Arctic, and
increasingly **militarily**, with Russia and China conducting **joint

#### \*\*\*Need a Russia supply chains -- goes nuclear

#### China [leverages]{.underline} supply chain dominance to invade Taiwan --- [extinction]{.underline}.

Tariffs are getting much attention, but we should discuss why
[**sourcing** from China is an **existential risk**.]{.underline}

Chinese President **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping has stated that
he [[intends to unite Taiwan with China]{.mark} peacefully or [by
**force**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Analysts have projected this will take
place between 2027 and '29.

[Taiwan will **not volunteer** to join China, so it will only happen
through **force**.]{.underline}

[Taiwan is **highly armed**]{.underline} (for its size) and has the
benefit of advanced technology from the U.S. [It will bring a hell of a
**fight**.]{.underline}

Conversely, [China is a **regional military superpower** and could bring
many **men**, ample equipment and vast resources to a **battle** with
Taiwan.]{.underline}

Both sides will likely target civilian and industrial infrastructure.
[Taiwan, outnumbered and potentially overwhelmed, will resort to
**asymmetric warfare**]{.underline}, i.e., cyber and other economically
destructive means, to fend off an attack. [This will have a
**substantial impact** on supply chains built for
**export**.]{.underline}

According to Warfronts, [Taiwan plans to take out **significant**
Chinese industrial **infrastructure**, including **power plants** like
the Three Gorges Dam.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline}, on the other hand, [plans to **convert** its
civilian maritime assets for **military uses**.]{.underline}

[The **devastation** to both countries would be
**massive**.]{.underline}

Whether Trump would intervene in a conflict between Taiwan and China is
unclear. Let's assume the U.S. stays out of it. (Never mind the
geopolitical impacts.)

[The battles would be **colossal**]{.underline},
**[bloody]{.underline}** [and incredibly **disruptive**]{.underline}.
[Civilian and industrial infrastructure would be
**destroyed**.]{.underline}

The U.S. and Western [[allies]{.mark} would likely
**[implement]{.mark}** huge [**sanctions**, with **catastrophic
impacts** on supply chains.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The bottom line is that we have to assume Xi is serious about his
intention to take Taiwan forcibly.

[Encouraging companies to **migrate** supply chains out of
China]{.underline} is not just good economics; [it's a **national
security issue**.]{.underline}

[We have a **couple of years**]{.underline} before China is ready. (Xi
has commanded the military to be ready by 2026.)

#### Scenario 2: Sanctions

#### Arctic military bases are necessary to secure the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR).

**Basak '24**(Ashton Basak, major in International Political Economy
while minoring in Diplomatic Studies and Journalism. Georgetown Security
Studies Review. October 5, 2024 "The Arctic Trilemma: The United States
Must Compete for the Transpolar Sea Route"

LF

Alternatively, the U.S. can have primary access to the TSR and advance
military objectives in the region , but sacrifice cooperation with
Russia and prompt Great Power Competition in the Arctic. [The Russians
already have an entrenched military presence in the Arctic and can
leverage its assets to dominate the TSR if they are uncontested. Thus,
the United States must cultivate a formidable military force in the
region to ensure that U.S.companies can utilize the TSR to their maximum
economic advantage]{.underline}. [Open sea lanes would have to be
secured through U.S. and Allied sea control. The competition to be the
economic hegemon of the TSR makes any opportunity for joint efforts
toward mutual prosperity unlikely and **military steadfastness a
necessity**.]{.underline}

Lastly, the U.S. can maintain peace and project a strong military
footprint but suffer from suboptimal access to the TSR. The political
climate of the Arctic would resemble a Cold War-esque gridlock due to
military build-up by both nations and potentially others who wish to
enter the mix. The militarization of the Arctic would sacrifice the
greater economic gains both sides could have achieved through a
demilitarized strait..

[Within this trilemma, **the U.S. must secure access to the TSR and
establish a strong military presence in the Arctic, embracing great
power competition**. Given Putin's militarism and completely shattered
relations with the West post-February 2022, Washington should not pursue
cooperation. To secure U.S.economic interests in the TSR in the 2040s is
to ensure no adversary will threaten U.S. ships]{.underline}. Naval
theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan argued that securing access to the high
seas for trade and commerce is crucial for a nation. [Sea lines like the
TSR are the economic arteries of Great Powers. They sustain economic
life. And they are too important to be left under adversarial control.
The U.S. must command the Arctic sea, like it has commanded the Pacific
and other oceans for the better part of half a century.]{.underline}

Strategic, Operational, and Tactical Restructuring

[To achieve its foreign policy objectives in and around the TSR, the
United States must restructure its approach on the strategic,
operational, and tactical level]{.underline}. To frame this section, I
will define the strategic level of military planning in the region as
how the United States employs its differentiated instruments of power to
achieve its objectives in the Arctic. Furthermore, the tactical level
deals with the precise arrangement of military forces in the Arctic,
while the operational level of military planning is the impetus, holding
these asset placements to the standard of the Arctic strategy.

[**At the strategic level, the United States must construct new air and
naval bases, modernize existing ones,** or leverage relationships with
partners for joint-access in order to close the base race with
Russia.]{.underline} [Access to the region will be important for air and
naval policing missions from a vantage point near the North
Pole.]{.underline} In June 2022, the United States was granted
unrestrained access to Evenes Air Station and Ramsund Naval Base in
Norway, while in February 2024, the United States gained access to eight
Norwegian military facilities including Andøya and Bardufoss Air
Stations. The United States should continue working with its Norwegian
and British allies to develop Evenes, Andøya, and Bardufoss as P-8
surveillance aircraft bases and F-35 hubs for surveillance runs in the
Arctic. [P-8s are maritime patrol aircraft that can engage in
anti-submarine/anti-surface warfare and simultaneously collect
intelligence, while F-35s are stealth fighter aircraft that can fly up
to supersonic speeds.]{.underline} **[These two military assets are
technological powerhouses that will bolster U.S. military presence in
the region if they can be stationed there permanently.]{.underline}**
The U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet should also move to be co-located at Ramsund
Naval Base, which is used as a major logistics hub for NATO ships and
can serve as headquarters for U.S. naval operations in the Arctic. To
oversee the other side of the Greenland-Svalbard-Norway (GSN) gap in the
TSR, the United States should seek a defense agreement granting the U.S.
Air Force permission to utilize the air base in Alert, Canada.

This **[dominance]{.underline}** [has allowed Russia to **control** the
**N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute]{.underline}. Since Arctic navigation
largely depends on Russian icebreakers, [Moscow **profits** by charging
**commercial fees** for their use.]{.underline}

At the same time, [this gives Russia a crucial **strategic
advantage**]{.underline}. [The Kremlin retains the **power** to dictate
**Arctic trade flows**]{.underline}. Icebreakers also operate alongside
Russia's naval forces, ensuring military operations can be sustained in
the region. Unsurprisingly, Russia's partner nations are now investing
in their own icebreaker fleets rather than relying solely on their
so-called "ally."

[Russia's Arctic **ambitions**]{.underline} also [serve as a tool for
**circumventing** Western **sanctions**]{.underline}. [By
**controlling** this trade corridor, Moscow can continue **exporting**
resources to Asia, **bypassing restrictions**.]{.underline}

[Western countries imposed **extensive sanctions** on Russia after the
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022]{.underline}. But [the
measures]{.underline} were unilateral and piecemeal -- and while they
[have been **effective** in disrupting the Russian economy,
**evasion**]{.underline} and 'trade deflection' through third countries
[**limits** their impact]{.underline}.

On 24 February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The response by the West -- including Australia, Canada, the European
Union (EU), Japan, the UK and the United States -- was to impose an
unprecedented raft of far-reaching unilateral sanctions against
President Putin's regime (see Figure 1).

These included restrictions on Russia's financial sector (including its
central bank); the removal of Russia from SWIFT interbank transactions;
and new rules on goods and services in strategic sectors of the Russian
economy (such as aviation, energy and shipping). Also announced were
sanctions on a wide circle of designated individuals, including those
close to Putin; those facilitating the military action (such as the
Wagner Group); soldiers and officials in occupied Ukrainian territory;
and oligarchs with assets in Western countries deemed to be associated
with Putin or with interests in critical sectors (EU Commission, 2024).

The 2022 round of sanctions built on measures first introduced in 2014
(in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and neighbouring areas).
Subsequent policies have been brought in to address the evasion of
sanctions, extending their reach to 'enablers' of the war based outside
Russia and to the individuals committing war crimes and breaches of
human rights in occupied Ukrainian territory.

To gain an understanding of the wide effect of the sanctions, there is
an EU sanctions tracker, a United States tracker and a searchable
database maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
The UK has also published a list of people sanctioned under the 2018
Anti-Money Laundering Act, and there are regular updates on measures
taken to curb Russian aggression (UK government, 2025).

[There are]{.underline}, of course, some **[gaps]{.underline}** [in the
**sanctions regime**]{.underline}, and [to some extent Russia has
managed to **evade** their full **effects**.]{.underline} For example,
the Kremlin has replaced pipeline exports of oil to Western Europe with
tanker-shipped oil to other countries through a 'shadow fleet'.

That being said, [the effect of Western **sanctions** on both Russia's
**GDP** and levels of personal disposable **income** has been
**considerable**]{.underline} (IMF, 2025). After three years of war,
[Russian GDP is now **10-12%** below pre-invasion
**trends**]{.underline}. Personal disposable income is 20-25% below
where it would have been without the conflict (Disney, 2023; Korhonen,
2023).

With both inflation and domestic interest rates in Russia currently
running at over 20% -- as well as the loss of foreign exchange reserves,
bankruptcies rising in domestic businesses and real estate, and
increasing difficulties in interbank and state bank transactions --
[Russia's economy looks **increasingly weak**]{.underline}. [All this is
happening against the backdrop of a **rapid expansion** of Russia's war
economy at the expense of both private sector spending and other public
sector activity.]{.underline}

Three years on, what questions remain about the use of sanctions?

[The aim of the sanctions against Russia has **two
dimensions**]{.underline}. The first is economic: [to
disrupt]{.underline} trade and \[~~cripple~~\] **[the Russian
economy]{.underline}** (that is, reduce its GDP). [The second
is]{.underline} political: [**supporting** Ukraine and **coercing**
Putin into bringing an **end** to the war.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine loss causes extinction.

higher price of Russian victory," Atlantic Council, October 26^th^,

The most [**immediate costs** of a Russian victory would be felt by the
**Ukrainian** population]{.underline}, of course. With much or all of
Ukraine under Russian control, the [**war crimes** already witnessed in
occupied areas of the country would **multiply**]{.underline}. [**Tens
of thousands** would be **executed** or **imprisoned**]{.underline},
while [millions would be subjected to **forced
deportation**]{.underline}. These horrors would [create **major
humanitarian** challenges]{.underline} for the wider European community,
with a massive new wave of Ukrainian refugees flooding across the border
into the EU.

**[Vindicated]{.underline}** [and **emboldened**]{.underline} [by
victory in Ukraine]{.underline}, **[Putin]{.underline}** [would almost
certainly seek to go **further**]{.underline}. The [Russian
dictator]{.underline} has [already made clear that he sees the
**reconquest** of Ukraine as part of a **broader mission** to correct
the perceived **injustice** of the Soviet collapse and the **fall** of
"historical Russia."]{.underline} His [next **targets** would most
likely be Moldova, Armenia, and the countries of Central
Asia]{.underline}. [If the West proves **unwilling** or unable to
**stop** Russia in Ukraine, there will be **little** to deter **further
aggression** against smaller and more vulnerable former Soviet
republics]{.underline}.

[With **NATO discredited** by the fall of Ukraine, Putin would then be
**tempted** to test the **resolve** of the alliance in a more
**fundamental manner** by **threatening** the Baltic
states]{.underline}. [Would a **demoralized** and **divided** NATO go to
war with a **resurgent Russia** over an **isolated incident** on the
Estonian or Latvian border?]{.underline} If not, [Putin would
**exploit** this weakness]{.underline}. [Failure to **defend** the
**territorial integrity** of a NATO member state would spark the **rapid
unraveling** of the entire alliance, plunging]{.underline} the whole of
**[Europe]{.underline}** [into **chaos**.]{.underline}

Even if the worst case scenario of a direct military confrontation
between Russia and NATO could be avoided, a [**Russian victory** in
Ukraine would inevitably **oblige** Western leaders to **boost** defense
spending to levels not witnessed since the end of the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. [This would require **sums** far in excess of the
money currently being **allocated** to Ukraine.]{.underline} Outgoing US
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Mark Milley recently warned that [a
Russian victory in Ukraine would lead to a potential **"doubling"** of
**defense budgets**]{.underline}. Others have suggested the cost would
be much higher, noting the [need to **establish** and **indefinitely
maintain** a dramatically increased military presence in Central and
Eastern **Europe**.]{.underline}

While the direct financial and security costs of a Russian victory in
Ukraine are already alarming, [the **geopolitical price** would be even
greater]{.underline}. The recent [**escalation** in Israel is a direct
consequence of the West's **indecisive response** to Russia's attack on
Ukraine]{.underline}. If Putin's invasion is seen to succeed, [other
**authoritarians** will be **encouraged** and international instability
will **spread** even further]{.underline}. [The **entire world** will
face **decades of insecurity** marked by mounting militarism, mutual
suspicion, and multiplying acts of **international
aggression**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} opportunity [cost to the
global economy will be measured in the **tens of
trillions**.]{.underline}

challenge]{.underline}. Opening seas allow Russian and Chinese forces to
move between the Pacific and Atlantic, while aircraft and naval vessels
can launch long-range missile strikes on North America or the North
Atlantic from the relative safety of Russian-controlled waters and
airspace.

More concerning, [[Russia and China are rapidly developing "precise
mass"]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[autonomous air, sea,]{.mark} and
undersea [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China is building the first
drone aircraft carrier, while Russia already operates autonomous
maritime vehicles]{.underline}. [The Russian Sarma autonomous undersea
vessels can conduct long-endurance missions, enabling a persistent
Russian presence unmatched by occasional American, Canadian, or Danish
patrols.]{.underline}

Reframing Arctic Strategy into America's Geostrategy

[As the Russia-China-Iran-North Korea axis strengthens,]{.underline}
[[traditional American]{.mark} geostrategic [views are
outdated]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Conventional threats no longer come only
from the east or west]{.underline} --- [**[the
Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark} [now [presents a growing danger **beyond
the existential risk of nuclear attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[It has become]{.underline} a zone of daily competition and [a
[potential battleground in **future**]{.mark} **Atlantic or Pacific
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Modern threats extend beyond bombers
and intercontinental missiles to include a diverse array of air and sea
systems. Autonomous vehicles will fight alongside traditional ships and
aircraft in large numbers.]{.underline}

America's line of contact with adversaries stretches from the First
Island Chain, through the Bering Strait, across the Arctic Ocean to
Norway, then down the NATO's eastern border to Turkey.

[[American national security depends on defeating Arctic-based
threats]{.mark} to North America while blocking Russian and Chinese
power projection into the North Atlantic and North Pacific]{.underline}.
Greenland is the geostrategic linchpin connecting the Arctic, North
America, and Europe --- a potential the United States and Denmark have
yet to fully leverage.

A NEW SWING STRATEGY-THROUGH THE ARCTIC

The first military asset to transit across the Arctic and the North Pole
was the USS Nautilus with Operation SUNSHINE in 1958 (Brown, 2014).
President Eisenhower's direction to provide this demonstration in the
wake of the Soviet launch of Sputnik was the beginning of Cold War
efforts to combine the ability to swing forces from military theaters
through the Arctic and to signal capability and resolve to adversaries
(Anderson & Keith, 2008; Griffin, 2013).

[The US military\'s \"Swing Strategy\" was a contingency approach
developed during the Cold War to address potential conflicts in Europe,
particularly the threat posed by the Warsaw Pact countries led by the
Soviet Union.]{.underline} In the event of kinetic hostilities between
the Soviet Union and NATO, the main body of the US Pacific Fleet would
'swing' to the Atlantic, in some planned circumstances moving before
conflict began (McCrea, et al., 1989). The movement would have involved
US aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, Army and Marine divisions and
B-52 bombers swinging from Asia to Western Europe, providing critical
surge capacity in case of a Soviet invasion of Europe (Evans & Novak,
1979; Walters, 1991). It was a secret US military strategy for about 25
years, beginning in the late 1950s.

[With the changing geopolitical landscape and the melting of the Arctic
ice, the US military could potentially adapt and modernize this strategy
to incorporate the Arctic region as an additional transit
opportunity]{.underline}. [In the context of a modernized Swing
Strategy, the Arctic could serve as a **strategic pivot
point**.]{.underline} With the opening of new sea routes due to melting
ice, the Arctic region could provide [a quicker and more direct route
for the US military and allies to move forces between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans. This route could allow the US to respond more quickly to
threats in either Europe or Asia.]{.underline} For example, in the event
of a conflict in Asia, US forces based in the Atlantic could use the
Arctic routes to \'swing\' to the Pacific more quickly than they could
via the Panama Canal. [Arctic routes would also provide resilience
should the Panama Canal be blocked due to weather or
hostilities]{.underline}. [Similarly, in the event of a conflict in
Europe, US forces based in the Pacific could \'swing\' to the Atlantic
via the Arctic, which could be **particularly important given the rise
of China as a major military power in the Pacific and the ongoing
tensions with Russia in Europe**, as well as the disruptions in key
maritime chokepoints, like the Suez Canal blockade, terrorist attacks in
the Red Sea, or Chinese control and denial of passage through the Panama
Canal.]{.underline} However, a viable swing strategy would require
sealift ships, and ships taken up from trade (STUFT) (Naval Historical
Society of Australia, 1990), to be ready and able to operate
consistently in the high-latitude, cold weather environment.

#### Otherwise it causes Arctic war, which escalates through conventional, gray-zone, and accidental warfare

Diplomacy at USC. (Matthew, 5-12-2025, "Is the Arctic Destined to be the
Most Likely Flashpoint for a Nuclear War?"

wtk

[[Amidst]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[melting]{.mark} polar [ice is opening Arctic sea lanes to
increased]{.mark}]{.underline} shipping traffic, resource exploration,
and [[military posturing]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's newest members,
Finland and Sweden, are Arctic nations. [Russia]{.underline} currently
[dominates the Arctic]{.underline} region, holding 53% of its total
coastline, operating the world's biggest icebreaker fleet, and has been
upgrading its Arctic military bases. [China is also increasingly playing
a role]{.underline}, conducting joint Arctic military exercises with
Russia and employing an icebreaker fleet of its own, despite its
complete lack of territory in the Arctic Circle.

But is the Arctic destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war? Let's look at the possibilities.

Despite being so cold, [[the]{.mark} Arctic is no stranger to military
conflict]{.underline}, [holding]{.underline} **[major strategic
value]{.underline}** and serving [as a passageway to both the Atlantic
and Pacific]{.underline}. During World War II, the Battle of the
Atlantic extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war
supplies to the Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany
invaded Norway, and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War
of 1940. As the Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a major theater for
submarine activity.

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland "one way or
the other" highlights the growing importance of the Arctic to the
security interests of the United States. [Greenland's [geographic
location]{.mark}]{.underline}, combined with the U.S.' operation of
Pituffik Space Base in the high north, [[provides
key]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[missile warning]{.mark}, missile defense,
[and]{.mark} space [surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}"
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The shortest flight paths for
nuclear missiles]{.mark} between the U.S. and Russia [exist over the
Arctic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the loss of this base on account
of a diplomatic blunder could open a key blind spot in America's
strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian
attack aimed at disabling American missile detection infrastructure is
unlikely due to the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.

Currently, [[the most likely path to a]{.mark} potential [nuclear
exchange in the Arctic would be through]{.mark} a conventional or "[gray
zone]{.mark}" Russian [attack]{.mark} on a NATO member]{.underline}.
[[Border skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace incursions]{.mark},
reckless military intercepts, and support to separatist
groups]{.underline} intentionally sit in the "gray zone" between peace
and outright war, but [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[lead to
**open conflict** that escalates to nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Conceivably, a gray zone or overt attack on other Greelandic
infrastructure, or an information operations campaign aimed at dividing
the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not outside of the realm of
possibility.

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland---which
shares a 1,343 km border with Russia---[[there is increased opportunity
that a NATO Arctic state could be attacked]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Highlighting this risk, American forces in Alaska recently staged a
drill in which hundreds of troops were flown to Finland to defend
against a mock Russian invasion. Yet rather than an overt invasion of a
NATO member, [Russia is far more likely test the waters by
conducting]{.underline} provocative and destabilizing small-scale [gray
zone activities.]{.underline} The disastrous results of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about its
ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear armed
country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct attack unlikely.
It is not entirely clear where the red line on gray zone activities
would be for Finland or what would trigger an Article 5 collective
defense declaration short of a direct attack across the border.

Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter a
Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing doubt about his willingness to defend a
NATO member that comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe
about America's commitment. As a result, France and the UK are
considering expanding their arsenals, signifying an increased reliance
on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic
NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it wants to decommission
its current warheads as it brings replacements online, potentially
doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an
airbase closer to the German border to be able to host nuclear weapons.
The UK, which has been historically dependent on the U.S. for its
nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning that dependence, and may seek
other options to assure an effective and reliable deterrent. This could
foretell a new nuclear arms race.

The upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the last remaining
strategic nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, portends a
period of nuclear proliferation that could echo the nuclear arms
buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, China, which has been operating in
the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid nuclear buildup in an
effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by 2035. China has
consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral nuclear arms
reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its comparatively much
smaller nuclear arsenal.

[[Navigation issues]{.mark} in the Arctic [could]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[lead to military escalations reaching the nuclear
level]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The]{.underline} Global Navigation
Satellite System ([GNSS]{.underline}), [which includes satellite
constellations like the American GPS system]{.underline} or Russian
GLONASS, [sees decreased reliability and accuracy in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The reasons for this are abundant, like the orbital
inclination of the satellites themselves and ionospheric interference.
With increased incidents of Russian GNSS jamming in Europe, it's
conceivable that Russia may employ similar tactics in the Arctic,
including spoofing, for the purpose of disruption or causing
navigational errors to trigger an exploitable international incident.
Military or civilian [[vessels straying into Russian territory could be
captured]{.underline}]{.mark}, their cargoes [seized]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} crews [held hostage]{.underline} for the purpose of
conducting hostage diplomacy. [[Resolving such a confrontation military
could **quickly spiral out of control.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising.

The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power. Though he has not signaled any specific intent to attack,
President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be capable of invading
Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated his intention to
directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump appears to defer
to the traditional American position of strategic ambiguity over the
island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to defend
Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a nuclear
weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S. mainland
or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack on Chinese
mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.

[What is most concerning is that [provocative military behavior
**anywhere** could lead to]{.mark} an unintentional cycle of escalation
that ultimately results in a [nuclear exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[As the Arctic opens to more]{.mark} military and commercial
[activity]{.mark}, [the frequency of encounters]{.mark} between military
forces [is likely to increase]{.mark}.]{.underline} As those encounters
increase, [[so too does the probability that an]{.underline} **[accident
or unintended attack]{.underline}**]{.mark} [may occur]{.underline}. As
Russia routinely flies patrols into the Alaska Air Defense
Identification Zone, an area of international air space in which the
U.S. identifies all aircraft, aggressive behavior by Russian pilots
raises the risk of a routine encounter evolving into an international
incident. But these [aggressive incidents are]{.underline} much more
[frequent]{.underline} elsewhere, like the Baltic and North Seas. For
example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two missiles against
a British RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea, but fortunately
neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is known for
conducting frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in the East
and South China Seas.

#### Revitalizing Arctic bases solves Russian [gray zone attacks]{.underline}.

It is possible that both responses will be deployed again to deal with
Trump's return. Stoltenberg's successor Mark Rutte (cited in Posaner and
Moens 2024) affirmed shortly after taking up his post that Trump was
"right" in asking more of the allies. NATO foreign ministers meeting in
December 2024 kept China high on NATO's agenda. A focus on "cash" and
China would be relatively straightforward -- both mark a continuity of
NATO priorities (Hockstader 2024). The harder work relates to Ukraine.
[Trump's apparent determination to reach a peace agreement has not been
matched by any enthusiasm in deploying American troops to police
it.]{.underline} The incoming administration's working assumption is
that Europe should own the peace (Rachman2024). [The resulting
geopolitical manoeuvring has proven controversial.]{.underline}
Ukraine's pre-sident Volodymyr Zelensky has argued that any settlement
with Russia requires NATO membership for Ukraine or at least a formal
invitation to join (something that Trump, as well as key NATO allies
such as Germany, oppose). One of Ukraine's key NATO backers, Poland, has
meanwhile suggested that any peacekeeping force deployed in Ukraine
ought to be placed under a "NATO format," something unacceptable to
France (Vinocur et al.2024). These debates are moot so long as Ukraine
remains at war. [But even as hostilities continue, Trump's impact is
being felt. Doubts over ongoing American military support to Ukraine
have placed a question mark over US involvement in the Ukraine Defence
Contact Group and the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine
(NSATU)initiative launched at the Washington summit. How far combined
European and Canadian efforts can keep these initiatives functioning in
America's absence is not clear.]{.underline}

However tough these challenges, dealing with them is at least premised
on a continuation of the United States as a NATO ally. Whatever the
trouble with Trump, having the United States in the Alliance at least
allows for the possibility of a stabilization of the transatlantic
relationship in the future. **[We noted above that an American exit is
unlikely.]{.underline}** [But one cannot rule out the possibility that
Trump so frustrated with the NATO allies impetuously takes this
option]{.underline}. [This would leave the allies utterly abandoned. The
European pillar that might substitute for a trashing of the
transatlantic connection is no closer in 2025 than it has been before.
It is fanciful to suggest that the EU might emerge as the framework of
such an endeavour given the absence of Canada and six European NATO
allies (including two big hitters, the United Kingdom and Turkey) from
the Union.]{.underline} Other schemes (the UK-led Joint Expeditionary
Force, for instance) are even less inclusive. Drawing up plans to
Europeanize NATO, meanwhile, face a geopolitical conundrum. Given the
allies still wish to tether the United States to NATO, it is hardly good
form to then engage in discussions on how the Alliance might cope with
an American exit. Any discussion cannot, in any case, occur formally so
long as the United States remains in place. [NATO's 75th year proved
momentous -- but three-quarters of a century in, the Alliance remains as
susceptible as ever to the vagaries of American dominance. While NATO
has drawn strength from the United States, Trump's position illustrates
the inescapable fragility of transatlantic dependency.]{.underline}

#### The plan is a proactive step by Trump to demonstrate a commitment to the alliance.

Increased US commercial activity in the Arctic could also deepen
relationships with US allies through joint ventures and partnerships. US
companies could partner with companies from allied nations to undertake
Arctic projects, sharing the risks and rewards. For example, a US
shipping company could form a joint venture with a Norwegian company to
operate a trans-Arctic shipping service, leveraging the US company\'s
logistical capabilities and the Norwegian company\'s experience in
operating in the Arctic environment. Similarly, a US energy company
could partner with a Canadian company to explore for oil and gas in the
Arctic. This could leverage the US company\'s technological capabilities
and the Canadian company\'s knowledge of the local environment and
regulatory landscape.

[Increased allied activity in the Arctic could also lead to technology
and knowledge sharing.]{.underline} [US and allied companies and defense
entities could share their technologies and expertise with commercial
and/or non-commercial entities from other nations, helping to improve
everyone's Arctic capabilities.]{.underline} For example, a US company
that develops a new type of ice-resistant ship hull could license this
technology to companies from allied nations. Similarly, a Canadian
company that develops a new method for predicting ice conditions could
share this knowledge with the US and others. [Currently, the US and its
NATO and Indo-Pacific allies have limited ice-capable maritime logistics
capacity. However, some countries, like Denmark, Finland, and Japan,
have experience operating in ice-covered waters and could potentially
provide valuable expertise.]{.underline}

[Greater US presence in the Arctic would also lead to greater policy and
regulatory cooperation with our allies.]{.underline} The US and its
allies could work together to develop common standards and regulations
for Arctic operations, promoting safety and environmental
sustainability. The US and its allies, particularly in close
collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO), could
develop a common set of safety standards for Arctic shipping and general
Arctic norms, reducing the risk of accidents and environmental damage.
They could also develop a common set of environmental regulations,
ensuring that Arctic operations are conducted in a sustainable manner.
The IMO as a global, non-US controlled entity, has particular potential
for furthering standards and best practices that may curb some of the
legally murky aspects of Chinese and Russian Arctic expansion.

[Most importantly, increased US focus, militaristic, diplomatic, and
commercial, would lead to greater security cooperation with our allies
and reduce China's maneuverability. The US and its allies could work
together to ensure the security of Arctic shipping routes and energy
resources, deterring potential threats from other powers.]{.underline}

[The US and its allies could conduct joint naval patrols of Arctic
shipping routes, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining freedom
of navigation. They could also share intelligence and conduct joint
exercises, enhancing their collective ability to respond to potential
threats.]{.underline}

[The Arctic presents significant opportunity for US economic and
security interests]{.underline}. Shipping routes and global maritime
chokepoints have become more fragile and contested, as demonstrated by
the Ever Given blockage in 2021 and Red Sea attacks in 2023-24.
[American and allied shipping companies and organizations should find
alternatives to traditional shipping routes to **build resiliency and
speed**, for **commerce and security**. Rather than thinking of the
Arctic solely as a destination theatre of operations, conceptualizing it
as a transit region would introduce more flexibility into DOD force and
supply movement for various **contingency planning, both for crisis and
conflict**. The Arctic can be used to move US equipment to Europe and to
move allied supplies across the breadth of Eurasia, **flexing, surging
and re-enforcing allies in the Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}. [This option
would better enable the combined might of the US and allies in Europe
and the Indo-Pacific to confront and **persevere against adversaries
like Russia and China, simultaneously**.]{.underline} This paper
encourages the DOD (US Navy, USNORTHCOM, TRANSCOM), DHS (US Coast
Guard), and the Department of Transportation (US Maritime
Administration, MARAD), along with key allied defense and commercial
shipping entities like Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC)
and the Canadian Coast Guard, to engage in proofof-concept Arctic
shipping exercises along the Northwest Passage (which runs along the
Canadian coast as opposed to the Russian coast, which is already an
established shipping route). These exercises would demonstrate the
viability of the Arctic as a transshipment domain for American vessels
and would be coupled with an assessment of the region's long-term
viability as a commercial route and option for Time Phased Force
Deployment Data (TPFDD) flow, including maritime sealift and logistics,
force posture and relocation, and resupply resilience. [This reframing
of the Arctic as not just a destination but also a crucial new transit
region, along with critical investment in the Arctic from across the US
government, would signal and encourage the US private sector to explore
trans-Arctic commercial shipping. If successful, this approach would
deepen US and allied economic cooperation and would enhance resilience
for key allies on the frontlines of great power aggression from Russia
and China. Furthermore, the development of US commercial and defense
presence would go a long way towards countering the PRC's aggressive
near and long-term Arctic ambitions]{.underline}

INTRODUCTION

The Arctic region, with its unique geopolitical and geophysical
characteristics, has emerged to be a pivotal arena for US military and
economic interests. [The 2021 Ever Given blockage of the Suez Canal
highlighted the vulnerability and contestation of global maritime
chokepoints, underscoring the need for alternative shipping routes that
bolster resilience and expedite commerce and security]{.underline}. This
paper posits an additional reconceptualization of the Arctic from solely
a destination theatre of operations to instead a region of transit,
thereby introducing greater flexibility into the Department of
Defense\'s (DOD) force and supply movement for diverse contingency
planning, encompassing both crisis and conflict scenarios. The
conventional perception of the Arctic as a destination theatre of
operations is limiting in terms of strategic planning and resource
allocation. Viewing the Arctic as a key transit region enables us to
leverage it for the movement of US equipment to Europe and the
transference of allied supplies across the breadth of Eurasia. This
shift can unlock new strategic avenues and make resource allocation more
efficient. [It can also encourage profitable commercial trade, due to
reduced transit times and alternatives to current maritime trade routes
that are increasingly contested, insecure, and
unpredictable.]{.underline}

#### This cooperation spills over to reduce reliance on Chinese REMs and bolster NATO.

As [part of the US's proactive Arctic Strategy, Washington should
prioritize economic investments in companies]{.underline} owned by NATO
members. [Through these investments, energy security within NATO can be
improved, and the **nations can decrease their dependence on rare earth
materials from China**.]{.underline} The United States has already taken
initial steps to secure critical mineral and clean energy supply chains,
but [more can be done]{.underline}. In September 2024, the United States
signed a Critical Minerals Agreement with Norway, demonstrating both
countries' commitment to working together to ensure energy security.31)
Another such opportunity for the U.S. to further support its Nordic
Allies exists in Sweden. In 2024 the Swedish mining company LKAP
discovered Europe's largest deposit of rare earth elements in the
northern city of Kiruna, Sweden. Norway and Sweden have already begun
collaborating to increase energy security through the Norwegian company,
REETec, which has developed technology to separate rare earth metals
that competes with China's production of these materials.32) According
to the CEO of LKAB, Jan Moström, this cooperation provides the
foundation to develop a "strong and sustainable Nordic value chain for
rare earth metals."33) [A proactive U.S. Arctic Strategy that takes into
consideration increased NATO energy security through Nordic investment
further bolsters the United States' ability to decrease dependence on
China and should be pursued.]{.underline}

[**Increased cooperation between the United States and** its Nordic
**NATO** Allies provides an opportunity for the U.S. to couple a new
proactive Arctic Strategy with tangible training goals for forces at the
tactical and operational levels.]{.underline} For example, [U.S. forces
and their Norwegian counterparts have benefited from a mutually
supportive military alliance for decades]{.underline}. During the Cold
War, Norway was a critical U.S. ally for power projection, defense, and
deterrence in the north. Its geostrategic location was optimal for
protecting NATO's northern flank from Soviet aggression so much so that
the United States stockpiled weapons, vehicles, and ammunition in
strategic locations across Norway.34) These [stockpiles were crucial for
increasing U.S. power projection and enhancing NATO's operational
responsiveness in the European arena]{.underline}. Additionally,
Norway's proximity to the Soviet Union and the adjacent Norwegian and
Barents Seas allowed NATO to challenge the Soviets' ability to deploy
nuclear-powered submarines if the Cold War turned hot.

The U.S.--Norwegian Alliance has only grown since the end of the Cold
War. In 2017, the United States Marine Corps began sending a battalion
of Marines to Northern Norway as part of a rotational deployment. The
United States Marine Corps continues to deploy thousands of forces to
train alongside its Norwegian Allies annually. Moreover, in 2018, Norway
hosted Exercise Trident Juncture, a NATO-led military exercise based on
a fictitious Article 5 collective defense scenario. It was the largest
exercise of its kind in Norway since the 1980s, and 31 nations
participated.35) [Large-scale multinational exercises of this kind
increase force proficiency operating in Arctic environments and enhance
NATO member states' ability to work with each other in
wartime.]{.underline}

The United States has been increasing its ability to work with its
Swedish and Finnish counterparts in the case of war. The United States
should establish bilateral training exercises with Sweden and Finland in
order to give these new NATO nations a greater understanding of how to
operate in a NATO construct. Conversely, [**cooperation with allies and
partners improves U.S. forces' understanding of how to operate
effectively in an Arctic environment**, making it a more reliable and
efficient partner for Arctic allies. This operational experience ensures
that allied forces are familiar with strategic terrain that may be
leveraged during a conflict with Russia.]{.underline}

Conclusion: How a [Proactive]{.underline} Arctic Strategy Supports
America's Focus on the Indo-Pacific

[The United States publication of the 2024 Arctic Strategy provides a
transparent approach aimed at reducing the possibility of escalation in
the Arctic]{.underline}. Moreover, [the current strategy recognizes
Russia's and China's Arctic ambitions and that the growing collaboration
between Russia and the PRC have "the potential to alter the Arctic's
stability and threat picture."]{.underline}36) The strategy presents a
tangible and realistic way forward for the U.S. to enhance the Joint
Force's Arctic capabilities, engage with Allies and partners, and
demonstrate an ability to work together across defense forces. [Although
the strategy indicates increased U.S. involvement in the Arctic**, it
remains reactive.**]{.underline} The 2024 Arctic Strategy already
outlines a tangible way for the United States to commit energy and
resources to the region. Although a deliberate shift in messaging will
not change the U.S. footprint in the Arctic, it will change the U.S.
mindset towards the region[. By making the Arctic a priority, the U.S.
demonstrates its commitment to supporting its Allies in the event that
Russia or China attacks.]{.underline}

Furthermore[, by shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy, the United
States is not abandoning its focus on the Indo-Pacific,]{.underline}
because the PRC envisions itself as a polar power and intends to reshape
the international system in its favor. [Future conflict with the PRC
will not be geographically constrained to the Indo-Pacific. By shifting
to a proactive Arctic Strategy now, the United States can deter China
from expanding its control over the Arctic and its critical
resources.]{.underline} The future battlefield is melting [and only by
taking actions today can the United States and its NATO allies win
tomorrow's war in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Bigger picture: the new normal of resource nationalism]{.underline}

[This is unlikely to be a one-off event. China's export controls are
part of a growing global trend toward "resource nationalism" --- where
governments leverage control over key raw materials to achieve broader
economic, strategic or political aims.]{.underline}

[As the energy transition accelerates and critical minerals become more
valuable, countries rich in these resources are reasserting ownership
and reshaping trade terms.]{.underline}

We have seen this in Mexico, which nationalised its lithium reserves and
handed exclusive mining rights to a state-owned enterprise. In
Indonesia, the government has banned exports of unprocessed nickel to
spur domestic refining and attract battery manufacturers.

Even in traditionally open markets, calls to tighten foreign access to
rare minerals are gaining political traction --- including in the US,
EU, and Australia.

[For multinational firms, this trend has significant implications.
Supply chain risk is no longer a matter of logistics and weather events
--- it's deeply geopolitical. Access to raw materials is now entangled
with national interests, trade disputes, and security
policies.]{.underline}

For risk managers, this signals a shift from reactive contingency
planning to proactive, geopolitical foresight. [It's no longer
sufficient to identify alternative suppliers --- firms must also assess
the political stability, regulatory trajectory, and strategic intentions
of countries where those suppliers operate.]{.underline}

[Understanding the shifting landscape of trade, investment restrictions,
and resource diplomacy will be central to ensuring long-term
resilience.]{.underline}

2\. Background on rare earth elements [**China's practical monopoly in
the rare earth market and export restrictions pose challenges to the
U.S. in supplying REOs.**]{.underline} This section provides more
insight on the issues surrounding REEs including the complex processing
of REEs and the balancing problem. Then it discusses the effects of
China's rare earth industry on the U.S. 2.1. Issues around rare earth
elements The production of REEs, defined as a group of 17 elements, is
complex as they do not exist individually like gold or copper. REEs must
be separated from each other, usually as oxide compounds, to be ready
for end use. Hence while the rare earth market is often characterized as
a single entity and production is typically expressed in tons of REOs
(as in Fig. 1), individual REEs exist in different amounts, some more
abundant than others.7 [The processed REEs are in demand by different
industries including clean energy technology, electronics, defense
weapon systems, and manufacturing goods.]{.underline} Shortages of
certain "critical" elements may arise because of their high market
demand and relatively low natural availability.8 Increased production of
REOs to meet the demand for such critical elements has resulted in
excess supply of other elements. [This discrepancy between the market
demand and natural availability has led to the balancing problem, one of
the most significant challenges in the rare earth market, identified as
early as 1985 (Falconnet, 1985).]{.underline} Several strategies have
been put forward to address the balancing problem. These tactics include
substituting for REE in production, recycling rare earth products like
magnets to recover critical elements, reducing the amount of REE used in
production, and introducing new applications for those available in
excess (see Binnemans and Jones (2015) for a detailed discussion of
these strategies). Research exploring the feasibility of each
alternative is ongoing, although comparable substitutes to REEs are not
readily available, and recycling is currently done on a small scale
(Jowitt et al., 2018). However, such initiatives should reduce market
demand for REOs and are discussed in greater detail in Scenario 3 of
Section 3. 2.2. The growth of China's rare earth market [Production of
REEs is further complicated due to China maintaining a dominant position
throughout the REEs supply chain, and it being the only country with the
ability to process all types of REEs.]{.underline} Production of REOs in
China grew in the 1990s and early 2000s. Simultaneously, China became
the world's largest processor of rare earth with the ability to
transform REO deposits into metals, alloys, and final products for
consumption, a complete value-adding chain (Shen et al., 2020; Barakos
et al., 2018). China's position as a leader in the rare earth market was
facilitated Fig. 3. U.S. imports of rare earth elements from China (%),
2001--2018. Source: Mineral Commodity Summaries, U.S. Geological Survey.
Fig. 4. World supply (thousand metric tons) and unit value (98\$/ton) of

U.S. Geological Survey. 7 Y. Lee and T. Dacass Resources Policy 77
(2022) 102702 4 by strategic government policies and low labor costs.
After creating policies to encourage the production of primary or
upstream rare earth products, in the 1990s, China's rare earth policies
started to promote the development of downstream activities that use
REEs in the manufacture of intermediate and final products (Shen et al.,
2020). Specifically, to encourage the production of mid-and down-stream
rare earth products in China, the central government introduced
production and export quotas on REOs and export taxes on rare earth
products. [The success of these policies gave Chinese domestic firms the
advantage of cheaper REOs and drove foreign firms to move their
processing operations to China.]{.underline} In addition to trade and
production policies, the Chinese government invested in research and
technological capabilities needed to expand the industry (Hurst, 2010).
Notably, the expansion of the Chinese economy also facilitated the
evolution of the rare earth industry. Rapid economic growth provided the
funds required for investments in the development of domestic mining and
processing, and facilitated the acquisition of mining operations and
production capacities on the foreign market (Balg ˆ ar ˘ et al., 2021).
Significant environmental defects are a direct consequence of rare earth
mining and processing (Charalampides et al., 2016). As a result, strict
environmental standards imposed during the 1990s in industrialized
countries, like the U.S., considerably hindered the industry's growth.
However, lax environmental laws allowed manufacturers in China to
produce faster and in much larger quantities than their competitors.
[2.3. U.S.-China trade dispute related to rare earth In 2019, new trade
conflict between the U.S. and China prompted discussions regarding the
threat of being cut off from REO imports from China as a potential
consequence of the trade dispute.]{.underline} In May of 2019, the Trump
administration published a list of Chinese products that could be
subject to 25% ad valorem tariffs (Morrison, 2019). [Though this
particular report excluded REEs, immediate actions by the Chinese
President, Xi Jinping, **sparked concerns** among American business
executives and policymakers regarding the future supply of REEs in the
U. S.]{.underline} Aware of the U.S.' dependence on REEs from China,
policymakers proposed increasing domestic exploration and production,
import diversification, and a reduction in demand through recycling and
reprocessing as strategies to reduce vulnerabilities in the REE supply
chain (U.S. Department of Defense, 2018). 3. Modeling the rare earth
market In this section, the paper introduces a simple supply and demand
model, with the REE market depicted from the perspective of the U.S., to
describe the effects of a supply shock from China (similar to the export
quota of REO in 2010). As discussed in the introduction, the model
focuses on mitigation strategies in the REO market. Fig. 5a illustrates
the U.S. domestic REO market when there is a binding export quota from
China.9 Because rare earth elements emanate from the same ore, we
represent total supply from U.S. producers as SUS and aggregate supply
from the rest of the world as SWorld. Our analysis focuses on the REO
market in the U.S., so DUS represents domestic total demand. In the
absence of trade, U.S. demand for REO is met by domestic production at a
market-clearing price and quantity of PA and QA respectively. Under free
trade conditions, U.S. consumers rely heavily on REE supply from the
rest of the world, SWorld (which is dominated by China).10 Market
equilibrium is achieved at point EQFT, where the SWorld curve intersects
the DUS curve. At free trade equilibrium point, QFT represents the level
of output and PFT the price. The distance QFT − QUS FT captures the
total REE imported since domestic producers will supply only QUS FT at
this relatively low market price. A supply restriction from China is
reflected by an export quota -- or from the U.S.' perspective, it is
felt as an import quota. Compared to free trade, the Chinese export
quota results in a higher market price (PEX) and lower equilibrium
quantity (QEX). Out of QEX, QUS EX is domestically produced, while the
rest is imported, subject to the quota. It is possible that depending on
the size of the quota, it may exist but not bind; Fig. 5b shows such a
case. Under free trade, the amount of REE the U.S. wants to import is
QEX − QUS EX. In this scenario, the export quota is higher than QEX −
QUS EX, implying the U.S. will want to import less than the quota. This
results in a non-binding quota, and the equilibrium price and quantity
under the export quota is exactly the same as that of free trade. Since
China's export quota was actually binding in 2010, we will use the
binding case as our benchmark scenario.

[China has a **chokehold** on the world's supply of **critical
minerals**]{.underline} -- and experts are warning [the situation is a
**major risk** to US national **security** if the government doesn't
step up its efforts to compete.]{.underline}

[Control over **rare earth** metals]{.underline} -- [which are needed to
build]{.underline} everything from the [semiconductors]{.underline} that
power iPhones to wind turbines, [electric vehicle batteries and military
weaponry]{.underline} like tanks and missiles -- [have become a key
point of **friction** and souring]{.underline} trade
**[relations]{.underline}** [between the US and China.]{.underline}

[Burdensome **regulations**]{.underline} and decades of lackluster
investment [have left the US **dangerously reliant** on
China]{.underline} -- [which mines]{.underline} up to
**[70%]{.underline}** [of the world's **critical
minerals**]{.underline}, controls roughly 90% of the processing capacity
and regularly uses unfair trade tactics to press its advantage, sources
told The Post.

"The fact that [we are **reliant** on China for **defense
equipment**]{.underline} is just a completely unfathomable and untenable
situation," said Pini Althaus, CEO of New York-based Cove Capital.

[If diplomatic relations get worse or an actual **conflict** breaks out
the two countries]{.underline}, US lawmakers and experts fear that
China, led by President Xi Jinping, [could cut off the supply
**entirely**]{.underline} -- with disastrous consequences for the US
auto industry, tech firms and the Pentagon.

"Quite frankly, [they can **turn off** the faucet]{.underline}," Althaus
added.

China's decades-long effort to corner the market is heavily subsidized
by Beijing, which uses its control over the supply to manipulate prices
and enacts ever-tighter export controls to cement its dominance. China
has also snapped up mineral rights throughout Africa and other
resource-rich locales as part of its Belt and Road Initiative -- on
highly favorable terms.

When the US or other rivals make progress on mining or processing a
particular material, such as gallium or lithium, China often responds by
flooding the market -- which sends prices tumbling and kills the
incentive to invest in projects, according to Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.),
who leads the House Select Committee on China's Critical Minerals Policy
Working Group.

"They dump massive amounts of these materials on the market and they do
that below the cost of production -- so these companies can't even
compete," Wittman added.

[China has already begun to **weaponize** its **control**]{.underline}
-- in part by [implementing **export bans** on mining and processing
technology]{.underline}. Last month, [China banned exports of three
**critical minerals** to the US]{.underline} -- gallium, germanium and
antimony -- and previously imposed restrictions on shipments of
graphite.

[The idea of a total embargo **isn't** so far-fetched]{.underline}. In
2010, [China briefly **halted shipments** of rare earth elements to
**Japan** while the two countries were embroiled in a territorial
dispute.]{.underline}

[U.S. military bases in the **Arctic**]{.underline} and sub-Arctic [are
**failing** to prepare their installations for long-term **climate
change**]{.underline} as required, [even though **soaring temperatures**
and melting ice already are **cracking** base runways and roads and
**worsening** flood risks up north]{.underline}, the Pentagon's watchdog
office said Friday.

The report from the inspector general of the Department of Defense
provides a rare bit of public stock-taking of the military's state of
readiness -- or lack of readiness -- for the worsening weather of a
warming Earth.

The U.S. military long has formally recognized climate change as a
threat to national security. That's in part because of the [**impact**
that intensifying floods, wildfires, extreme heat and other natural
disasters are having and will have on **U.S. installations** and troops
around the world.]{.underline}

[Increasing hurricanes, flooding, storms and wildfires in recent years
have caused **billions of dollars** in damage to]{.underline} Florida's
Tyndall Air Force Base, Nebraska's Offutt Air Force Base and other
**[U.S. military installations]{.underline}**, [and interrupted
training]{.underline} and other operations.

For years, laws, presidential orders and Pentagon rules have mandated
that the military start planning and work so that its installations,
warships, warplanes and troops can carry out their missions despite
increasingly challenging conditions as the use of fossil fuels heats up
the Earth.

While even acknowledging climate change was a career risk for
administration officials under former President Donald Trump, President
Joe Biden directed faster, more sweeping action on climate change by the
Department of Defense and other agencies as one of his first acts in
office.

Despite Biden's emphasis, inspectors visiting the United States' six
northernmost military bases last June and July found none were carrying
out the required assessments and planning to prepare their installations
and operations against long-term climate change.

Further, "[most **installation leaders**]{.underline} at the six
installations we visited [in the **Arctic**]{.underline} and sub-Arctic
region [were **unfamiliar** with military installation resilience
planning **requirements**, processes, and tools]{.underline}," the
inspector general reports said.

Senior officers told the inspector general's inspection team that their
[operations lacked the **training** and **funding** to start the
required work on **hardening** their bases.]{.underline} [Some saw
**requirements**]{.underline} for that kind of long-term planning
[as]{.underline} assembling [a **"wish list"**]{.underline} that would
go up against competing priorities, the officers told the inspectors.

A Pentagon spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for
comment Friday. The inspector general report cited Defense officials as
saying that the Biden administration has finished or is working on many
of the report's recommendations to better incorporate climate
preparations at bases and across military branches, and would increase
resources to bases to make that possible.

[One of the bases is in Greenland and the other five in
Alaska]{.underline}: Thule Air Base, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson,
Clear Space Force Station, Eielson Air Force Base, Fort Wainwright and
Fort Greely.

[The Arctic]{.underline} and sub-Arctic are [important to U.S.
**strategic aims** in part because of rising **tensions** and
**competition** with Russia and China]{.underline}, and [in part because
sharply rising temperatures are **melting** sea ice and opening up both
**shipping lanes** and access to the region's **oil** and other
resources, increasing interest and **traffic** in the
region]{.underline}.

[The Defense Department]{.underline} also [sees]{.underline} "[the
Arctic is a potential **vector** for an **attack** on the U.S. homeland,
a **region** where Russia and China are operating more **freely**, and a
**strategic corridor** for DoD forces between the Indo-Pacific and
Europe]{.underline}," the report notes.

The inspectors found [the kind of **problems** associated with worsening
**climate change** already causing **trouble** at the U.S.
bases.]{.underline}

At Fort Wainwright in Alaska, [heightened wildfire risks in 2019
interrupted training for two Pacific Air Force squadrons, so that one
was able to carry out only 59% of planned training for a
period]{.underline}, the report said.

Many of the specific discussions of climate risks at the six bases were
blacked-out in the version of the report made public Friday.

But inspectors photographed and described some. That included [cracked
and sunken runways **undermined** by melting ice, **damaged** hangers
and roads, and a **collapsed** rock barrier that had been piled up to
hold back **floodwater** from a river swollen by glacial
melting]{.underline}, at Thule in Greenland.

[Leaders at all six bases]{.underline} visited [noted]{.underline} that
kind of **[damage]{.underline}**, inspectors said,
"[however]{.underline}, [officials from **five** of these installations
said they had not begun **incorporating** future climate risks into
their **installations' planning**]{.underline}."

"They stated that [their **day-to-day focus** was on reacting to
immediate **problems** or **reducing** risk to existing hazards, rather
than **planning** for future hazards]{.underline}," the report noted.

[The Arctic is warming **two to three** times **faster** than the rest
of the world]{.underline}. A March heat wave that hiked Arctic
temperatures 50 degrees (30 Celsius) higher than normal stunned
scientists.

[Of 79 U.S. military installations overall, the Department of Defense
says **two-thirds** are vulnerable to worsening flooding as the
**climate** worsens and **half** are **vulnerable** to increasing
drought and wildfires.]{.underline}

For years, **[Moscow]{.underline}** [has **prioritized** the Arctic as a
**critical pillar** of its national security, opening or
**refurbishing** over **50 military bases** and scaling up military
**operations** across the region]{.underline}. [The **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, meanwhile, with a focus alternating between the
Middle East and the Pacific, [has largely entrusted Arctic **security**
to its allies and partners in the **region**.]{.underline}

The problem: One of those key partners, **[Canada]{.underline}**,
[is]{.underline} by its own admission [**unprepared** to face the Arctic
challenge]{.underline}. [Unless the US works quickly to help fill that
**gap**, it means American interests in the Arctic are going to be **at
risk** moving **forward**.]{.underline}

[**Historically**, the United States has been **protected** by the
operational challenges of waging an Arctic offensive in **frigid
conditions**]{.underline}. But [the growing prospect of a "**Blue
Arctic**,"]{.underline} ice-free for months out of the year, [could
allow a **great power adversary** to deploy **military assets** right in
America's **backyard** for the first time in history]{.underline}.
Already, [Russian and Chinese warships have been seen patrolling
together off the coast of Alaska in **unprecedented
numbers**]{.underline}. As the US military's former top commander for
the Arctic, Gen. Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy said, [the region is "no
longer a fortress wall" and we must be **prepared** to **defend**
it.]{.underline}

In the Arctic, [Russia]{.underline} is not a "pacing threat" as China is
in the Indo-Pacific; it [is **well ahead** of the United
States]{.underline}. [Russia controls nearly **53 percent** of the
Arctic Ocean's coastline and has built **countless bases** across the
region]{.underline}. **[Washington]{.underline}**, meanwhile, [only
maintains **six bases**]{.underline} and five of them are outside of the
Arctic Circle in southern Alaska. As of 2023, [the United States Coast
Guard possessed only **five** icebreakers or ice-capable patrol ships
which are critical to **maintaining** a **presence** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Moscow, meanwhile, has 57 such vessels. [It will be
**years** before the American icebreaking fleet is **large enough** to
effectively support large-scale US **operations**.]{.underline}

In addition to rapidly scaling up its force posture, [Russia has also
conducted **unprecedented** naval exercises and harassed American
**fishing vessels** in Arctic waters]{.underline}. [Moscow has begun to
assert its **control** over newly expanded **shipping
lanes**]{.underline} through the Arctic like the Northern Sea Route
(NSR), declaring certain parts of this route to be internal Russian
waters with an aim towards regulating shipping that passes through it.

In the future, [Russia may try to **expand** its control over other
**Arctic waters** closer to the **U**nited **S**tates and present a
**direct threat** to the homeland]{.underline} and to US operations in
Europe and the Indo-Pacific. The United States Navy's top Arctic
commander, Adm. Daryl Caudle fears that Moscow may try to create its own
"'nine-dashed line' around the North Pole."

Indisputably, the United States is ill-equipped to face the Arctic
challenge alone. To maintain security and stability, the United States
Department of Defense (DoD) has increasingly emphasized the role of
regional allies and partners as "the core of DoD's strategy for the
Arctic." Canada remains at the top of the list, but [Ottawa's
**ability** to rise to the occasion has been called into **question** by
experts and officials **alike**]{.underline}. Canada's own Minister of
National Defense Bill Blair infamously remarked that the
[Canadian]{.underline} Armed Forces (CAF)'s [recruiting problems have
sent the organization into a **"death spiral."**]{.underline} Meanwhile,
Former Vice Admiral Mark Norman described [Canada's military readiness
as **"borderline atrocious."**]{.underline}

From an American perspective, [Canada's **military woes** highlight a
fundamental **weakness** of US national security strategy in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, [which depends heavily on
**collaboration**]{.underline} with able partners.

the Arctic]{.mark}, or High North, [that NATO allies agreed]{.mark} to
put in the new 2022 Strategic Concept, and so it [is especially
notable]{.mark}]{.underline}.145 It was not specifically discussed in
the U.S. Arctic strategy, but it is the United States, along with
Canada, whose naval assets would need to cross the North Atlantic Ocean
to reinforce European allies in an Article 5 contingent.146 Allied plans
to invest in surveillance capabilities, especially radars in the area of
the GIUK gap, will help mitigate this challenge.147

Second, Russia's relative incapacity to threaten a conventional military
land incursion into European Arctic allies will be welcome news to the
Biden administration, whose recent strategic documents do not indicate a
high prioritization of the region in terms of defense. Most notably, the
NSS lists the Arctic last in its overview of regional policies.148 The
strategy is cautious about promising U.S. presence in the Arctic, saying
it will only be exercised "as required, while reducing risk and
preventing unnecessary escalation."149 The U.S. National Defense
Strategy mentions the Arctic fleetingly and is also cautious: "U.S.
activities and posture in the Arctic should be calibrated, as the
Department preserves its focus on the Indo-Pacific region."150 Its
emphasis is on stability, homeland defense, and maritime domain
awareness, and there is no language in the Arctic section about
deterring threats to Arctic allies and partners. This language does
appear in the U.S. Arctic strategy, which states, "We will deter threats
to the U.S. homeland and our allies by enhancing the capabilities
required to defend our interests in the Arctic."151 The document
promises needed investments in domain awareness capabilities and
icebreakers.152 Still, it also emphasizes avoiding escalation and
notably states that it "may be possible to resume cooperation under
certain conditions."153

Taken together, the three documents seem to indicate an administration
that will take regional threats in the Arctic seriously and will likely
continue to show occasional presence and participate in exercises, but
that will prefer cautious actions so as not to threaten the relative
stability of the region. Doing so allows the administration to focus on
other geopolitical priorities, like China, and not excessively
complicate other regional priorities like climate change research and
economic development. One finding from this paper that may therefore be
of interest is that there are indirect, light-touch ways to enhance
Arctic security: effective imposition of the sanctions regime concerning
dual-use computer chips seems to be one way to diminish the conventional
Russian threat in the Arctic that does not involve deploying U.S.
military assets or personnel to the region. If the administration is
seeking to balance the need to protect allies and partners with a desire
to not overly militarize the region, this could be notable.

Third, given the state of Russia's conventional armed forces, Russian
aggression toward Arctic European states may continue to lean heavily on
hybrid tools. There have been encouraging signs of a Western response to
this, such as Norway's deployment of the Home Guard to protect critical
infrastructure, and NATO allies' assistance to help them do so via
increased allied ship patrols in the North Sea.154 Norway also recently
adopted its annual Flotex naval exercise to include a component focused
on protecting oil and gas installations.155 Even the U.S. Arctic
strategy recognizes the challenge, promising to focus on "building the
resilience of critical infrastructure," including against
cyberattacks.156 This is a welcome recognition from the Biden
administration of Russia's penchant for using hybrid tactics in the High
North---however, the administration may not yet have fully recognized
that this tool is likely becoming more attractive to Russia in the
Arctic, relative to conventional force. NATO allies like Norway, and
future members like Sweden and Finland, may need to further impress this
probability on the United States and other allies at the NATO level.

Finally, it is probably too early to give an accurate and comprehensive
estimate of the future Russian warfighting capability in the Arctic,
given the impact of the Ukraine war. It would be prudent, however, given
what is known and what is coming to light, to revisit assumptions that
guided prewar analysis, campaign modeling, and wargaming concerning the
region. Indeed, U.S. military doctrine is explicit that assumptions
should be constantly reconsidered in light of new information,157 and
NATO doctrine echoes this. As NATO's new Supreme Allied Commander Europe
starts crafting the alliance's new regional defense plans,158 there is
an opportunity to consider some of these preliminary findings in High
North scenarios. In the meantime, the old saying, sometimes attributed
to Winston Churchill,159 that "[[Russia is never as strong as she looks;
Russia is never as weak as she looks,]{.mark}" might [be a prudent
approach for the West with respect to its security and defense planning
in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The U.S. needs to better **secure** its Arctic territories and waters,
while **working** more with its allies to better **secure**
theirs]{.underline}. Although the Arctic has been relatively peaceful
since the end of the Cold War---a recurring mantra has been "high
latitude, low tensions"---[U.S. military forces need to be **prepared**
for **unexpected conflicts** that can erupt quickly, like Putin's
full-scale invasion of **Ukraine** and Hamas' devastating attack on
**Israel**.]{.underline}

[The U.S. military's ability to **operate** effectively in the Arctic is
**impeded** by various factors.]{.underline} As we described in a recent
report, [chief among these are the fact that it has so **few assets**
that can **operate** in the region and so little **infrastructure**
there, particularly in **comparison** with Russia]{.underline}.
[Increased investments in]{.underline} platforms,
**[infrastructure]{.underline}**, equipment, communications, multidomain
awareness, and enhanced tactics and training [would enable the U.S. to
better secure its **critical interests** in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[These interests **span** the vast Arctic region]{.underline}: the [U.S.
needs to]{.underline} work alongside NATO allies to [secure North
America's Arctic approaches and its European allies' long, vulnerable
Arctic coastlines and **borders** with Russia]{.underline}. It also has
a [key interest in **countering** Russian submarines at the Arctic's
edge, where the gaps]{.underline} between Greenland, Iceland, and
Britain [are **gateways** for Russian submarines to enter the
**Atlantic**]{.underline}. [The U.S. also has **homeland security**
responsibilities within its own Arctic territory and
waters]{.underline}, where thousands of Americans live. This area also
harvests roughly half of the nation's seafood, plus substantial amounts
of oil, zinc, and other resources. [As sea ice abates during parts of
the year,]{.underline} the Arctic's [maritime routes are becoming
**increasingly important** shortcuts between oceans.]{.underline}

The importance of the region to overall U.S. interests is highlighted in
the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for the Arctic Region,
released in October 2023, and in the 2022 National Security Strategy. It
was also underscored by the U.S. Coast Guard's publication of its Arctic
Strategic Outlook Implementation Plan just a week ago. Although Coast
Guard operations in the Arctic are particularly visible to civilians,
the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Space Force also conduct
training, exercises, and operations there.

[**Challenges** from both Russia and China **underscore** the urgency of
**improving** Arctic military capabilities]{.underline}. [Russia was
**building up** its Arctic military and civilian capabilities in the
years before its **full-scale invasion** of Ukraine.]{.underline} [This
included **re-opening** Arctic bases]{.underline} that had closed after
the Cold War, [conducting more **extensive** training and
exercises]{.underline}, [stationing **more forces** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [and **operating** more throughout the
region]{.underline}. [It also has over **50 polar** icebreakers, far
more than any other country]{.underline}. The U.S., by comparison,
currently has two, though more are being acquired.

[China has also become **increasingly involved** in the
region]{.underline}. [Both of its **polar icebreakers** have been
extensively collecting **info**rmation on the **Arctic's physical
environment**. It has invested]{.underline}, or tried to invest, [in
**Arctic properties**]{.underline} from Greenland and Europe to Siberia,
[and has secured the diplomatic status of an **observer** at the Arctic
Council]{.underline}. [In an effort to achieve a greater role in the
Arctic, China has alternately referred to itself as a **"near-Arctic
state"**]{.underline} and to the Arctic as a shared environment
belonging to all nations, neither of which is accurate. [Beijing's
**increasing collaboration** with Moscow across all areas has also been
**deepening** in the Arct]{.underline}ic. [The two countries have
operated naval vessels together in the approaches to Alaska]{.underline}
during the last few summers, and also [recently signed a maritime law
enforcement agreement that facilitates further Arctic
**collaboration**.]{.underline}

For the U.S., [Arctic-specific capabilities are **needed** because of
the effect of the region's **unique environment** on
**operations**]{.underline}. [Any system that was not specifically
designed for that environment is likely to **fail**]{.underline}: [fuels
gel, materials shatter, lubricants freeze, and batteries do not work.
The environment is even **harder** on **people**]{.underline}, [who
struggle to just to **survive**]{.underline} in extreme temperatures.
[Arctic operations are further **impeded** by the region's tremendous
**internal distances** and its **remoteness** from the rest of the
world]{.underline}. [Sparse **infrastructure** that is relentlessly
battered by the **elements**, limited **satellite coverage**, and unique
**electromagnetic effects** that degrade communications also
**contribute** to challenges]{.underline}. Climate change is also

The previous DOD strategy for the region came out in 2019, but much has
changed in the region and world since then. While the strategic
environment has changed dramatically, [climate change is **rapidly
altering** the Arctic]{.underline}, Dory said.

[The region \"is warming **three times faster** than the rest of the
world,\"]{.underline} she said. \"[Melting **ice** and warmer
**temperatures**, they affect DOD operating context, and lead to
increased **human activity**, including from our
**competitors**]{.underline}.\"

**[Russia]{.underline}**, with its large area above the Arctic Circle,
[is an obvious competitor, but **China** is also a player]{.underline}.
\"[The People\'s Republic of **China**]{.underline} ... [seeks increased
**access** and influence in the region and **leverages** the changing
Arctic dynamics to take advantage of Arctic **resources** and to seek a
**larger role** in regional governance]{.underline},\" she said.

[Russia has continued its **expansion** and **modernization** of Arctic
military **infrastructure**]{.underline}. \"[The Arctic has long played
a **significant role** in Russia\'s security approach and economic
**calculations**, and today is no exception]{.underline},\" Dory said.
\"[Russia\'s Arctic military **capabilities** have the potential to hold
the U.S. **homeland**, as well as allied and partner
**territories**]{.underline}, at risk.\"

[China and Russia are **growing** together and have held combined
**naval patrols** in the region]{.underline}. DOD continues to monitor
this cooperation very closely.

\"On the other side of the equation, the addition of Finland and Sweden
as NATO allies presents an opportunity to deepen collaboration on Arctic
security issues and strengthen security and defense and deterrence in
the region,\" she said. \"So, along with the evolution of the Arctic
geopolitically, the \[Defense\] Department is also evolving our approach
to the region. And the strategy seeks to update this approach so that it
is fit for purpose for this new era in the Arctic.\"

[More **land** is available in the region and **sea lanes** are opening.
More ships, planes, people are in the **region**]{.underline}, and this
[could increase the risk of strategic **competition** and
**miscalculation** in the region]{.underline}, Dory said. That is why
the strategy --- really a roadmap for cooperation --- is so important,
the acting undersecretary said.

"The position of the United States upon the two oceans would be either a
source of great weakness or a cause of enormous expense." When Alfred
Thayer Mahan penned these words, Alaska was not yet a state and the
Arctic was still a vast icescape. But now Mahan's predictions must
undergo a twenty-first-century update to account for the arrival of the
third frontier: a blue Arctic. As ice melts, new trade routes will
emerge, resources long hidden beneath the ice will become accessible,
and a new strategic battleground will emerge at the top of the world.
While politicians and pundits debate the validity of climate change and
its causes, the Arctic continues to melt, with blue waterways capable of
supporting deep-draft commercial and military vessels predicted by 2050.
Although continued focus on the Indo-Pacific, Atlantic, Mediterranean,
and Red Sea regions holds merit, accepting risk in the Arctic may result
in failure to prepare for and adapt to the significant diplomatic,
economic, cultural, and military transformations already in the making.

[As the Arctic's melting ice opens new shipping routes]{.underline},
thaws previously ice-protected shores, and unlocks access to untapped
resources, [the [far north takes on new strategic
importance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the Bering
Strait]{.underline}---expected to become the Arctic's Gibraltar---[is
already a chokepoint for global shipping and military
operations]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[Russia's militarization of

our]{.mark} urgent [attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to
safeguard our national interests and promote global stability, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} [[**must ignore** the red
herring of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**climate debates** and]{.mark}
instead [accept the reality of ice melt by honing a comprehensive and
aggressive Arctic strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have not a moment to
waste: already lagging years behind our competitors in this arena, such
a combined effort among US military, federal, and private entities will
require decades of planning.

Climate Change and Warfare: An Environmental History

While Earth's climate is changing at a faster pace than ever before,
climatic episodes over the past two thousand years---like the Roman
Climate Optimum (200 BCE--150 CE), the Little Antique Ice Age (300
CE--700 CE), the Medieval warming period (950 CE--1250), and the Little
Ice Age (1350--1850)---offer important perspective. In this era of
human-influenced climate change, these periods tell us that climate
change does not always spell disaster. Indeed, studies of these periods
tell us that climate influences the conduct or outcome of war rather
than determining it. Our modern era of climate change can certainly
exacerbate vulnerabilities for those militaries who ignore it; but for
those who most capture the winds of history into the sails of their
respective war machines, it can provide strategic opportunities.

Climate can influence who you fight, what you fight over, when you fight
and where, and perhaps most importantly, why you fight. Changing Arctic
conditions demand strategists consider those five W's in a
twenty-first-century context. Before 2050, the United States, Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland must assess how the diminishing
North Pole ice wall will transform into blue borders accessible not only
to trade, but also to other strategic competitors, like Russia and
China. The importance of such considerations could hardly be overstated:
Arctic flashpoints include vast mineral resources, largely untapped oil
and gas reserves, and disputes over sovereignty within exclusive
economic zones and resultant trade wars. In the past, such
considerations have only been necessary in the summer months (except for
submarine and long-range air assets), when climate conditions were most
hospitable to both land and sea forces. Yet melting ice is projected to
allow for year-round naval and commercial shipping competition as early
as 2050---with sea trade via the region expected to double by 2035.
Compared to the Panama and Suez Canals, the Northern Sea Route offers
significantly reduced transit times---and with it, fuel costs---thus
rendering it perhaps the most lucrative alternative to traditional
shipping lanes.

But why reallocate resources from our present strategic footprint?
Simply put, the Arctic is quickly evolving into the new dance floor for
geopolitical competition (including, in its most extreme manifestation,
warfare), replete with all the classic Thucydidean trappings of fear,
honor, and interest. This is not an exaggeration: Russia and China have
already signaled their desire for Arctic dominance. With the world's
largest icebreaker fleet, Russia poses the most dominant and formidable
force in the region. Russia has seized the strategic and operational
advantage, maintaining near-continuous operations in the Arctic,
sharpening firsthand experience in the seascape, and challenging any
foreign militaries who dare transit these frigid waters. Not far behind
Russia, China---the self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---has similarly
declared itself a regional force. China has invested heavily in its
Polar Silk Road, thus expanding its maritime and global spheres of
influence and all but guaranteeing strategic and economic returns in the
region.

US Arctic Strategy

In recent years, DoD's Arctic Strategy has undergone considerable review
and revision. Indeed, current policy is drastically different from the
policies of a decade ago. These new strategic visions no doubt have
heightened our awareness of the Arctic's growing geopolitical
importance, and these policies are not without their strengths. But our
most recent strides leave one wondering: Are we doing enough? The United
States is an Arctic nation, but does our strategic policy fully reflect
this? [[Current US strategy]{.mark} acknowledges, for example, the
Arctic is not just warming---it's becoming a new arena for strategic
competition]{.underline}. In this light, [the strategy's]{.underline}
"monitor-and-respond[" approach [reads as both too passive and too
reactive for the competitive contest]{.mark} likely to develop [in the
far north]{.mark}]{.underline}. While we recognize the innate importance
of robust monitoring and other intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities in the region, we also acknowledge that
China and Russia are already conducting combined exercises off the coast
of Alaska. Considered in this light, our monitor-and-respond strategy
resembles the military equivalent of relying on a giant Ring camera:
it's great for observation, but insufficient for deterring adversaries
and projecting power.

More alarming still, [the United States [lags woefully behind]{.mark}
her fellow [great powers in Arctic preparations]{.mark}]{.underline}. By
the time the United States published its first radical transformation of
Arctic strategic policy, it was decades, even centuries, behind Russia's
interest in the region---an interest that transformed into action by the
2000s. Likewise, China has been honing its Arctic intentions since 2013,
when it gained "observer" status in the Arctic Council. The following
year, Russia created its Arctic Joint Strategic Command, and just three
years after that, declared its plans to "phase NATO out of the Arctic."
By 2018, China published its first Arctic policy white paper, and
shortly after launched its first domestically built icebreaker. In 2023,
Russia declared the Arctic its second priority---a priority Moscow is
well positioned to promote with its already robust Arctic presence and
operating bases. [[Two of the world's most powerful militaries have
signaled their intent to establish]{.mark} strategic, diplomatic, and
economic [dominance]{.mark} of the world's smallest ocean. Can the
United States really afford to simply monitor and respond?]{.underline}

We recognize this call to action is not without significant obstacles.
As our most current Arctic Strategy rightly points out, we must "balance
against other DoD global commitments"---and we have to determine how to
do this in an environment replete with fiscal, structural,
environmental, and manpower challenges. We are not suggesting that DoD
abandon our global commitments in favor of Arctic operations. We are
arguing, however, that [the department [cannot abandon Arctic power
projection in favor of keeping global commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It will be hard. It will stretch our forces and our capabilities. But it
is worth remembering that Russia is doing both. China is doing both. And
increasingly, they are doing both together---including in back-to-back
naval exercises in 2022 and 2023 off the coast of Alaska. Accordingly,
we must do both, and we must start now. [US Arctic strategy and policy
must shift from a future-oriented mindset of what we will do when time
and resources allow to an ethos of what we are doing now]{.underline},
lest we look back in 2030 or 2050 at what we should've, could've, or
would've done differently to prepare for a blue Arctic. In this light,
[[aiming principally to "manage risk in the region" is not]{.mark} an
[acceptable]{.mark} substitute for establishing presence]{.underline}.
[The United States [must take action now]{.mark}]{.underline} to ensure
we are prepared to successfully maintain peace and prosperity in the
blue Arctic.

Policy Recommendations

We do not diminish the immense difficulties the United States faces in
implementing such active---but vital---strategic and operational
postures. Establishing a presence in the Arctic and also maintaining
presence and capability in other global regions with US interests at
stake will stretch our manpower and our assets. But we argue our stated
objectives can be achieved in the following ways:

1\. [[Increase year-round]{.mark} air, land, surface, and subsurface
[operations in the Arctic now]{.mark}.]{.underline} We can ill afford,
as the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy puts it, to "explore options to improve
mobility in all seasons and variable conditions across the Arctic's
diverse geography and weather" when our adversaries are already past the
exploratory and into the operational phase. [The Arctic is a highly
dynamic operational environment]{.underline} that forces even the most
seasoned DoD operators to perform familiar tasks in new ways[. We must
practice]{.underline} these tasks [in adverse conditions
now]{.underline}.

2\. Assess manpower and other resource alignment against the full range
of US global interests and ensure the Arctic is appropriately resourced.
Based on the findings, DoD should be prepared to consider an increase in
the size of the US military while simultaneously ramping up sustained
year-round Arctic operations.

3\. Build or obtain more polar-capable icebreakers now. Russia's
icebreaker fleet far exceeds ours. Indeed, even our "near-Arctic" peer
competitor, China, has more. Expanding the icebreaker fleet will ensure
year-round access to and presence in Arctic waters.

4\. [[Establish an Arctic combatant
command]{.underline}]{.mark}---USARCTCOM. [The Arctic
region]{.underline}, although small, [is currently divided between at
least three combatant commands]{.underline}. [Establishing a separate,
Arctic-specific command]{.underline} not only signals its strategic
importance, but also [prevents geographic task saturation as national
defense, economic prosperity, and safe navigation of the high seas
becomes top priorities]{.underline} in the blue Arctic.

5\. After establishing USARCTCOM, stand up Eighth Fleet to cover the
Arctic Ocean and its accompanying borders. With the new fleet, the Navy
should establish an Alaskan joint fleet concentration area, to include a
new naval operating base on the Alaskan coast for air, surface, and
subsurface assets---much like our current bases in Norfolk and San
Diego. This fleet concentration area would not replace operating forces
in the Pacific Northwest, which should continue to focus on Third Fleet
operations.

6\. [Reconcentrate existing military cold-weather assets to the new
Alaskan fleet concentration area. For the Marine Corps, an additional
mountain weather training center should be established]{.underline},
which would focus on sustained Arctic peace- and wartime operations. In
the Army, the reactivation of the 11th Airborne Division in 2022 was an
important step, but the service should add an additional division to
complement it. This fleet concentration area should also be the home
port for all icebreaker and cold-weather surface assets.

7\. [[Invest in Arctic-specific infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Arctic is a highly dynamic operating area. DoD planners should therefore
feel empowered not only to think outside the box, but also to dream big
as they determine how best to operate in such challenging conditions.
Ports, communications networks, and radar systems will be needed, of
course, but how do we build a fleet capable of continuous US Arctic
power projection, freedom of navigation, and protection of our people,
our borders, and our assets? Rather than a separate icebreaker fleet,
should we instead consider merging platforms---finding ways to blend the
new with the old? Could something as lethal and impressive as a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and icebreaker ever become a reality?
Perhaps it's not feasible at the moment, and the mere suggestion might
seem ludicrous to some. But [in a new frontier, we must push the
boundaries, expand the realm of the possible, and offer creative
solutions to our modern challenges.]{.underline}

8\. Make Arctic studies and training a mandatory and highlighted aspect
of officer training. Operations in the Arctic are not business as usual.
Like other operating areas, forces operating in the far north are still
required to successfully accomplish tasks and achieve objectives, but in
weather conditions that shift on a dime. Therefore, increasing Arctic
training at the officer candidate--level is a low-budget, but highly
effective way to develop warfighters who are prepared to think outside
the box in these extreme, unique, and adverse conditions. Mandatory
curriculum on cold-weather operations that incorporate field and fleet
lessons learned from the Arctic should be developed and taught. The
curriculum should explain the challenges of operating in extreme
weather, climate change, space weather, communications blackouts, and
the midnight sun. The services should also consider sending some officer
candidates, cadets, and midshipmen to summer training, immersion trips,
and internships in the region---with follow-on debriefing periods at
corresponding DoD offices.

The Arctic is Changing---So Must Our Strategy

The far north is a rapidly transforming geopolitical arena where the
United States must act with urgency if we are to maintain strategic
dominance, power projection, and peaceful operations in the blue Arctic.
[[Climate change]{.mark} has done more than alter the landscape---it
[has rewritten the strategic calculus of the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}, exposing new vulnerabilities and
opportunities that the United States cannot overlook. Russia and China
are aggressively positioning themselves for Arctic dominance, while the
US response has remained cautious, reactive, and dangerously slow.
Although "monitor-and-respond" can be a valuable strategy in some
instances, it will likely prove wholly insufficient to respond to the
unfolding realities of this emerging seascape.

[History warns us that [those who fail to adapt to emerging battlefields
cede the advantage to those who do]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic,
once an afterthought in military and geopolitical planning, is fast
becoming the new frontier in global strategic competition. As new trade
routes emerge, resource claims solidify, and military posturing
escalates, the United States must transition from passive observation to
active presence. [[We must]{.mark}]{.underline} invest in icebreakers,
[[bolster Arctic forces, expand infrastructure]{.mark}, and make Arctic
training a core element of military education. [We cannot wait]{.mark}
until the Arctic is fully blue to recognize its strategic value; [we
must act now]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What Are Carbon Emissions and Why Is Net-Zero Important?

Understanding Carbon Emissions

Carbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing
global temperatures to rise---a phenomenon known as the greenhouse
effect. The maritime industry contributes to carbon emissions through
the combustion of fossil fuels, both during vessel operation and in port
activities.

Why Net-Zero Matters

[Charting the Course to Net Zero: A Pathway to IMO's Maritime
**Decarbonisation Goal by 2050**]{.underline}

Net-zero means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted with an
equivalent amount removed from the atmosphere. Achieving net-zero by
2050 is essential to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, as outlined
in the Paris Agreement. This goal is critical to mitigating the worst
impacts of climate change, including extreme weather, rising sea levels,
and biodiversity loss.

Key Facts About Carbon Emissions and Usage 1. Maritime Emissions
Contribution: Shipping accounts for 3% of global emissions---more than
the entire airline industry! 2. Impact of Large Vessels: A single large
cargo ship can emit as much sulfur as 50 million cars in a year. 3.
Emission Projections: Without intervention, shipping emissions could
rise by up to 50% to 250% by 2050 due to growing trade demands. 4. Slow
Steaming: Reducing ship speeds by just 10% can lower fuel consumption by
nearly 20%. 5. Future Potential: If the industry fully adopts low-carbon
technologies, it could reduce emissions by 80% by 2040, showcasing its
transformative potential.

Energy Usage by 2050: Demand and Supply

As global trade continues to expand, energy demand in the maritime
sector is expected to rise significantly. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) projects that electricity could account for 50% of final
energy consumption by 2050, driven by advancements in renewable energy
and electrification. [However, the maritime sector's **reliance on oil
is expected to decline** as alternative fuels become more
widespread.]{.underline}

Decline of Oil and Its Implications Oil currently supplies 80% of the
maritime sector's energy needs. [However, with **finite reserves** and
increasing environmental regulations, oil production is expected to
decline. This shift could create an energy gap that must be filled by
low-carbon and renewable energy sources.]{.underline} The decline in oil
use is both a challenge and an opportunity[. It **forces the maritime
sector to innovate and adopt cleaner energy sources**, accelerating the
shift toward sustainable practices.]{.underline}

Greener Energy Source Transitions [The maritime industry is exploring
**several alternative energy sources** to reduce its carbon
footprint: 1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): While not entirely
carbon-neutral, LNG offers a 20% reduction in CO₂ emissions compared to
traditional marine fuels. 2. Methanol and Ammonia: These alternative
fuels are gaining traction due to their potential for near-zero
emissions when produced from renewable sources. 3. Hydrogen: A promising
option for achieving net-zero, hydrogen can be used as a fuel directly
or as a base for ammonia production. 4. Wind-Assisted Propulsion:
Technologies like rotor sails and kite systems harness wind energy to
supplement traditional fuels, reducing emissions. 5. Biofuels: Derived
from organic materials, biofuels are renewable and emit fewer greenhouse
gases]{.underline}.

Lower Carbon Solutions

[Transitioning to greener energy requires both technological innovation
and operational efficiency.]{.underline}

Energy-Efficient Designs [New ship designs with **streamlined hulls**
and **advanced propulsion** systems can significantly reduce fuel
consumption. Retrofitting existing ships with energy-saving technologies
like air lubrication systems and waste heat recovery can also help lower
emissions.]{.underline}

[Digitalization and Automation Digital tools like advanced analytics,
artificial intelligence, and blockchain can optimize logistics, improve
fuel efficiency, and reduce idle times in ports. Automated systems can
also improve the precision of fuel usage and minimize
waste.]{.underline}

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

[**Onboard CCS systems capture CO₂ emissions from ship exhaust and store
them for later use or disposal.**]{.underline} While still in its early
stages, this technology holds promise for reducing emissions from
existing vessels.

How 2050 Looks for Maritime Trade with a Green Transition [By 2050, the
maritime industry could be transformed by the widespread adoption of
green technologies and fuels. 1. Zero-Emission Ships: The majority of
vessels will run on renewable fuels like hydrogen, ammonia, or methanol.
2. Green Ports: Ports will be powered by renewable energy, equipped with
electric charging stations, and optimized for just-in-time arrivals. 3.
Digital Integration: Advanced digital systems will enable seamless
coordination across the supply chain, reducing inefficiencies and
emissions. 4. Circular Economy Practices: Recycling and reusing ship
materials will become standard, further reducing the industry's
environmental footprint. 5. Energy Corridors: Green shipping corridors
will connect major ports, enabling efficient and sustainable maritime
trade. This transformation will not only reduce emissions but also
create economic opportunities, including millions of new jobs in clean
energy sectors. It will also enhance the industry's resilience to
climate change and energy market fluctuations.]{.underline}

#### Better infrastructure and access is key to environmental security -- bad card

The USCG's Arctic Strategy proposes three objectives for their future
activity in the region. First is 'Improving Awareness': "accurate
awareness requires greater collection and sharing of maritime data, as
well as increased cooperation in analyzing and disseminating
near-real-time information" (USCG, 2013, p.22). This means building
better shore infrastructure to assist in real-time monitoring and an
active presence in the area. Second, 'Modernizing Governance', is the
active strategy to involve all levels of government in maintaining a
safe, secure, and stewarded maritime domain. This includes support for
Arctic Council initiatives and accession to UNCLOS. Third, 'Broadening
Partnerships', is similar to the previous objective. It endeavors to
make the USCG an expert resource for other initiatives, to support and
enhance understanding of the area and facilitate safe activity, and to
promote an integrated approach to the region. Additionally,
"[sustainable economic development in the Arctic is essential for
increasing economic security]{.underline}" (p.34), which necessitates
maintaining appropriate partnerships. Further aspirations include
partnering with industry to facilitate best practices and better on-site
preparedness for emergencies and spills, as well as placing USCG
monitors and assets in the right places to monitor compliance and
activity (p.35).

[Despite these simple, straightforward objectives and goals, the USCG
faces many challenges in making them a reality. Foremost among them is
its ability to operate effectively in the area, something which is
hampered by a combination of sea ice, weather, and a lack of
infrastructure.]{.underline} The closest USCG base to the Arctic Ocean
capable of serving larger vessels is in Dutch Harbor, in the south west
of Alaska. In the summer of 2012, the USCG deployed one cutter (a large
patrol vessel), [two helicopters and support personnel to Barrow, Alaska
as part of Operation Arctic Shield, however in the fall they had to
leave due to a lack of support facilities for operability in the harsh
Arctic winter. This sort of mobile presence, supplemented by shore
infrastructure, is the preferred operating strategy in areas of high
activity (USCG, 2013, p.36), however a lack of Alaskan infrastructure
limits this to seasonal deployment.]{.underline}

The USCG readily acknowledges that "[the Nation must plan for ice
capable assets that can effectively carry out year-round search and
rescue, environmental response, charting, scientific research, and other
Arctic operations]{.underline}" (USCG, 2013, p.36), and that the "most
capable surface unit would be a polar icebreaker. Polar icebreakers can
transit safely in a variety of ice conditions and have the endurance to
operate far from logistics bases\" (O'Rourke, 2015, p.26). It also notes
that the icebreaking capacity of the Coast Guard is limited. This is
because the Polar Star, the nation's only all-season heavy icebreaker,
is already beyond her service life, and is using outdated technology.
The USCG maintains that the ship is currently meeting their minimum
capacity to fulfill essential missions (p.15), however it is slated to
be retired before a potential new icebreaker could be built. It also
splits its time between the Arctic and Antarctic and must dock for
periodic maintenance in Seattle. To fill this gap is the Healy, though
it is only a medium icebreaker. This leaves the USCG with a limited and
occasionally nonexistent capacity to operate in the Arctic during the
winter. The lack of icebreakers, as compared to Russia's large and
modernizing fleet and Canada's small but increasingly capable fleet, is
simply due to a lack of funding.

[To many, the idea that increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks
on Ukraine could lurch towards a wider European conflict seems not only
probable but inevitable.]{.underline}

However, amid the drumbeats of international conflict, one crucial
factor is being overlooked: the impact of climate change as a potential
trigger for war.

NATO has committed to taking a leading international role on climate and
security. Yet the landmark climate agreement reached late last year at
the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for Western leaders
meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and translate them
into tangible action.

[NATO recognises climate change as a 'threat amplifier' for traditional
security issues, but it needs to go further as studies indicate global
warming is already rapidly accelerating the likelihood of armed
conflict, especially in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Arctic icecaps are melting at record rates, making deposits of gas, oil
and minerals worth trillions of dollars accessible for the first time.
Over the coming years, **this will spark a race for Arctic dominance
that Russia is hellbent on winning.**]{.underline}

[With Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline, Vladimir
**Putin believes domination of the region's resources is critical to the
economic survival of his regime**. The Arctic is estimated to hold 412
billion barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of the world's undiscovered
reserves.]{.underline}

Putin is hardly trying to hide his agenda. [**Russia already operates a

Putin is moving soldiers, icebreakers, warships and submarines to the
region, as well as conducting Arctic drills that test hypersonic
missiles capable of evading American defences.]{.underline}

[[The Arctic is rapidly emerging]{.mark} as one of the most
geopolitically significant regions]{.underline} in the 21st century.
Climate Change and the melting of the ice floes in the Arctic Ocean have
presented new opportunities, which has generated the issue of managing
the polar region among the major international powers. The Arctic is
once again becoming a major strategic problem due to two factors. The
first is global [[warming]{.underline}]{.mark} which
[[accelerates]{.underline}]{.mark} the prospects for [[exploitation
of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and of
transit through sea lanes that shorten distances and push the riparian
states to assert their interests and sovereignty over these spaces. The
second is [the [global strategic competition]{.mark}]{.underline}
[between the]{.underline} United States ([U.S.]{.underline}) and its
allies, [Russia and China]{.underline}: it antagonizes relationships and
[[exacerbates disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} hitherto managed through

conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark} for a long time. [[As one of the only
physical meeting points between three great powers]{.underline}]{.mark}
(the U.S., Russia, and China) it could be argued that it was inevitable
to become a geopolitical conflict zone, especially considering the
long-standing conflicts between these three countries.

//shruti

[The Arctic is insufficiently prioritized amidst the United States'
competing global interests. The future battlefield is melting and
**demands US attention**, as a partnership between Russia and the
People's Republic of China fuels strategic competition in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Thus, **[the United States must adopt a proactive
Arctic strategy,]{.underline}** working with its NATO Allies [to ensure
that the Arctic remains stable and free from conflict.]{.underline} The
US's [2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United
States "seeks a stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to
internationally agreed upon rules and norms."]{.underline}1) To achieve
a secure Arctic, the 2024 Arctic Strategy, produced by the U.S.
Department of Defense, follows a "monitor-and-respond" approach.
**[However, this reactive strategy is inadequate.2)]{.underline}**

[Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine provides evidence that Moscow will
not adhere to the current global order and will continue to challenge
Western international norms]{.underline} wherever possible[, including
in the Arctic.]{.underline} NATO's growing appeal among European states
suggests that NATO may also be called upon to guarantee the future of
Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe, isolating Ukraine, and
expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a
closer alliance between the United States and its Arctic NATO allies.
Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden, has expanded,
and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO members. The
alliance offers an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its
position in the Arctic region while not having to go it alone.

[The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions,]{.underline} though the makings of a
more effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024
Arctic Strategy. [Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its
mindset towards the Arctic. A proactive Arctic Strategy is needed, in
which the United States and its NATO partners are not afraid to define
the rules and laws governing the north.]{.underline} Critics of this
approach will claim that taking a more assertive position in the Arctic
will further antagonize Russia and divert important resources from the
Indo-Pacific region and China. This is simply not the case[. Russia and
China have already taken steps to claim and militarize the Arctic. By
acting now, the US and its NATO allies will be better positioned to
counter the threat posed by Russia and China in the Arctic and
beyond.]{.underline}

#### Current arctic capabilities are insufficient to solve

Operations, 'Let Alone Dominate,' Experts Say". The War Horse.

Missile launchers illuminated under the glowing green fingers of the
northern lights, white-and-gray camo with fur-lined hoods, Green Berets
perched two to a snowmobile---these were the scenes from Arctic Edge in
2022, a biannual joint training exercise first convened in 2018 to train
troops to operate in the marginal conditions north of the Arctic Circle.

"\[These exercises\] bring us all together as a joint, combined, and
allied force to think about how we can defend the Arctic, how we can
work together to not just survive up here, but thrive and be able to
protect our homeland," the commander of the military's Alaskan Command,
Lt. Gen. David Krumm, said after the 2022 exercise.

In recent years, [the U.S. [military]{.mark} has [highlighted
exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} like this [[to underscore]{.mark} the
[importance of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, trumpeting its
commitment to protecting U.S. security interests there.

[The military "[must be able to]{.mark} ... [shape]{.mark} the
[security]{.mark} environment]{.underline}" in the region, states the
Pentagon's 2019 congressional report on Arctic strategy.

"U.S. Naval [[forces must operate more assertively across the Arctic
Region]{.underline}]{.mark}," proclaims the Navy's "Strategic Blueprint
for the Arctic," released in 2021.

The Army published its strategy for "regaining Arctic dominance" the
same year.

But while these and other recent policies highlight the region's
critical importance, along with the military's growing interest in it as
climate change reshapes the polar environment, experts argue [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [done little to commit]{.mark} [the
targeted, long-term investment or build up the capacity needed to lead
in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[[We don't have the capability to sustain forces up
there]{.underline}]{.mark}," says Ryan Burke, the research director of
the Homeland Defense Institute at U.S. Northern Command, as well as an
affiliate professor at University of Alaska Fairbanks' Center for Arctic
Security and Resilience and the co-director of Project 6633 at West
Point's Modern War Institute. "We don't have the infrastructure, we
don't have the know-how, we don't have the institutional knowledge. [We
[don't have any of what we need to be present, let alone to actually
dominate]{.mark} the damn thing."]{.underline}

As interest in the region grows, the military has begun to make some
changes. In December, Finland, which joined NATO this year, gave the
U.S. military access to 15 Finnish bases and the ability to store
weapons and equipment in the country; Sweden, which has applied to join
NATO, also gave the U.S. access to 17 bases. The agreements follow a
similar pact with Norway the previous year. In 2022, Eielson Air Force
Base, just over 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle, stood up a full
complement of F-35s. Marine units now rotate through cold-weather
training with their Norwegian counterparts, and during the past several
years, U.S. forces have participated in trainings like Arctic Edge or
Arctic Challenge, a Nordic-led joint military exercise.

[But [much of the necessary]{.mark} communication [systems]{.mark},
general infrastructure, and, critically, sustained presence and training
[needed to understand and operate in such a complex environment has yet
to materialize]{.mark}]{.underline}. The lofty [[visions
promised]{.mark} in recent strategies [don't always match]{.mark} the
[realities]{.mark} on the ground]{.underline}.

"The Army is a land force," Burke says of the Army's promise to
"dominate" the region. "The Arctic is principally a maritime domain."

As for the maritime side of things, the U.S. military has just two
functional polar icebreakers. Plans to bring on additional ships have
been repeatedly delayed. The operational capacity of the U.S. military
to regulate economic interests or respond to a large-scale event, such
as an oil spill or a mass casualty scenario, isn't assured.

"The Army has a strategy, the Navy has a strategy, the Air Force has a
strategy," Burke says. "Congratulations. We can't do any of it."

'You Need Lots of Other Things'

Sixty years ago, at the height of the Cold War, the U.S. icebreaker
fleet was quadruple the size it is today. The Navy and the Coast Guard
operated seven heavily armed Wind Class diesel-electric ships between
them, along with the Coast Guard cutter Glacier, a larger heavy
icebreaker operated first by the Navy and then by the Coast Guard.

"During the Cold War, the Arctic was probably more important militarily
than ever before in history," says Scott Savitz, a senior engineer at
RAND who worked on a recent report assessing U.S. military arctic
capabilities. "It was the literal high ground. There was recognition
that if missiles were going to be flying between North America and the
Soviet Union, most of them would be going that way."

In the 1970s, as the Coast Guard decommissioned the Wind Class cutters
after decades in service, the service brought two new heavy icebreakers
online: the Polar Sea and the Polar Star.

Compare that with Russia's icebreaker fleet: More than 45 military ships
and counting---three additional ships are under construction, and
Vladimir Putin has said the country plans to have 13 new icebreakers
online by 2035. Even China, a thousand miles from the Arctic Circle,
just laid the hull for its third icebreaker.

For years, the Coast Guard and Navy have been jointly developing a new
class of icebreakers: polar security cutters, heavy icebreakers, the
largest the United States has ever commissioned. The plan is for just
three new ships---to be followed, at some undefined point in the future,
by three additional medium icebreakers---but the program has been
repeatedly delayed and plagued by design issues. A GAO report last
summer found the Polar Security Cutter program was still at risk of a
"costly rework and further delays."

And while comparisons of the United States' paltry icebreaker fleet to
Russia's and China's are useful shorthand for the state of the country's
Arctic investment, the reality of the U.S. security landscape in the
Arctic is far more complex.

"Polar icebreakers are necessary, but not sufficient," Savitz says. "You
need lots of other things."

Chief among them are building up the capacity for domain awareness and
operational readiness: the costly infrastructure---things like
communications systems, equipment, and assets, along with the ability to
maintain them---that helps the military understand what is happening in
the environment, and the sustained presence of people who can monitor
that information and respond if necessary. For the most part, the United
States has neither.

The most recent Pentagon Arctic strategy was released in 2019. It
emphasizes that [[Arctic security is U.S. security]{.underline}]{.mark},
and it focuses on three lines of efforts in the region: improving domain
awareness, increasing operations, and bolstering rules-based order. But
while it nods to things like cold weather training and joint exercises,
it does little to pinpoint specific or significant fiscal or resource
commitments.

The Sea and the Star were joined by the Healy, a medium-class
icebreaker, in 1999. (Full disclosure: I served on the Healy as a Coast
Guard officer from 2009 to 2011.) Today, only the Polar Star---more than
45 years old---and the Healy are operational. The Polar Sea has been out
of service since 2010, slowly cannibalized for parts.

"I think a lot of people have done a good job laying out what needs to
happen to improve U.S. access and presence in the Arctic," says Abbie
Tingstad, a research professor at the Center for Arctic Study and Policy
at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, as well as the lead author on the
recent RAND study, conducted while she was with RAND. "Now it just costs
money and time and getting organized."

In 2022, the department stood up an Arctic Strategy and Global
Resilience Office to guide U.S. security strategy in the region and help
coordinate the three combatant commands that have responsibility over
the region: U.S. Northern Command, U.S. European Command, and U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command.

A national strategy for the Arctic, released by the White House in 2022,
highlights security as its first strategic pillar for the region,
pointing specifically to the need to "develop capabilities for expanded
Arctic activity."

Defense Department officials say an updated version of its Arctic
strategy will be released early this year.

"This was one of those areas where we could have gotten out in front of
it," says Cameron Carlson, the assistant director of the Center for
Arctic Security and Resilience and dean of the College of Business and
Security Management at University of Alaska Fairbanks. "And I think
[[every year that]{.mark} [slips]{.mark}]{.underline}, we---especially
on the DOD side---[[we end up taking a step farther]{.mark} and farther
[back]{.mark} from it because we really haven't defined what our true
Arctic interests are, what our stake will be here for the long
term]{.underline}."

'Everything Breaks in the Arctic'

There are many reasons for the gulf that exists between platitudes in
policy and priorities in practice, but a primary one is just the sheer
complexity of operating in the Arctic. Maintaining equipment and
conducting operations in such an extremely cold environment require
unique standards and approaches.

"Everything breaks in the Arctic," Savitz says. "Fuels gel, lubricants
don't. The batteries fail, the materials shatter and snap, everything is
iced over. And it's extremely hard on humans."

For instance, in the Pentagon's announcement of its Arctic strategy
office, Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for
Arctic and global resilience, pointed out that much of the military's
infrastructure in the far north is built on permafrost, which is melting
as the planet warms.

"We're working to mitigate that," Ferguson said at the time.

[[The harsh environment makes continued maintenance
paramount]{.underline}]{.mark}---a challenge in budget cycles that tend
to favor shiny new toys. And the region's exceptional parameters mean
equipment designed for the Arctic might not be particularly useful
elsewhere---another tough fiscal sell.

Take the Navy's surface fleet, for example. U.S. naval submarines have,
for decades, operated in the Arctic---but primarily out of sight,
intentionally. The Navy's Arctic strategy promises an "enhanced
presence" in the Arctic, pledging to "provide our Sailors, Marines, and
Civilians with the education, training, and equipment necessary to
preserve peace and respond to crises in the region."

That's a complicated promise.

"If you create a surface fleet that is specific to that region ... that
will become a heavier ship," Carlson says. "And heavier ships don't move
as fast. They're not as agile. They're not as fuel efficient."

So instead, the Navy's strategy points to partnerships with the Coast
Guard, which has more institutional knowledge about Arctic operations as
well as the military's only icebreakers.

"The Coast Guard has been the most active of any of the services in
trying to maintain Arctic capabilities and build capacity," Savitz says.

In part, that's because of the nature of Arctic security: It's more
about competition than it is about conflict. The Coast Guard is used to
a mission set that focuses on enforcing laws and regulations, and
responding when things go wrong.

For the other military branches, being told to wait around "in a place
that is remote, and where it's really hard to operate, and where you're
likely going to have various systems fail, when there's intense
attention on other parts of the world, or flare-ups, or crises" isn't
popular, Savitz says. "Part of the problem is that there is such a
strong nondefense component of security up there."

But the Coast Guard, as the only military branch housed in the
Department of Homeland Security, is always strapped for cash, and the
need for U.S. presence and response in the Arctic is only growing,
analysts argue. A shrinking ice cap and increasing ship traffic raise
questions about regulating things like fisheries and access to other
resources, or enforcing international standards. And then there's the
issue of what happens if things go wrong---like an environmental
catastrophe or a search-and-rescue disaster.

"The intersection of climate change and, say, economic factors, or the
intersection of changing demographics---all of those combinations also
then create these situations where I think these black swan-type events
may become a little bit more frequent," Tingstad says. "The U.S. as a
whole has such global priorities---something has to get racked and
stacked, and that's certainly understandable. But from an Arctic
perspective, of course, the concern is that it's low probability. It
feels low probability until it actually happens."

Other Arctic nations, particularly Russia, which has a substantial
military and economic presence in the region, may be better poised to
respond---and its day-to-day operations there raise questions about
whose values and interests are prioritized in the Arctic.

"[[Presence equals influence, and influence]{.mark} often [translates to
power]{.mark}]{.underline}," Burke says. "The point being is that [[if
we]{.mark} collectively [want]{.mark} to be influential, and have any
sort of [power]{.mark} position [in the Arctic]{.mark} whatsoever, [we
actually need to be there]{.mark}]{.underline}."

For states that have unresolved deterrence problems, [conventional
deterrence strategies]{.underline} often [have **much** to
offer]{.underline}, though their comparative advantages inevitably vary
depending on the specific case. First, [for many states conventional
deterrence is more or less the **only** realistic military
option]{.underline}, [given the material and political **costs** of
seeking security through **nuclear** or other unconventional
means]{.underline}. Second, [even states that **possess** nuclear
arsenals face deterrence challenges that nuclear threats are
**ill-suited** to address because employing such weapons would be
**incredible**, **unpalatable**, or simply
**inconceivable**]{.underline}. Finally, many of the tools of
conventional deterrence have significant flexibility, with value for
non-deterrent missions ranging from defence to security cooperation to
disaster relief, something that tends to be less true for forces
optimized for nuclear deterrence.

Among conventional deterrence strategies, punitive resistance is a
straightforward threat that takes relatively little imagination to
appreciate, though it is not as hard to dismiss as a good-sized nuclear
threat. It also has the great virtue, relative to indirect conventional
retaliation strategies as well as nuclear ones, of tending to be
credible even when the issue at stake is not a vital interest for the
deterrer that would clearly merit escalation to protect---not every army
fights staunchly when attacked, but doing so is a natural response to
invasion. When deterrence and defence overlap, deterrence is
strengthened, and forces meant to deter can still defend if deterrence
fails.

Perhaps most important, [punishing an enemy on the battlefield during an
invasion imposes **immediate costs**]{.underline} that [are difficult
for a prospective attacker to **discount**]{.underline} (except to the
extent that it considers its armed forces to be expendable, which
Russia, for example, does not appear to do). This relative
incontestability represents an important advantage over deterrence
approaches that rely on the enemy being frightened by the prospect of
punishment or defeat that would occur only with considerable delay.
Whether in the form of gradually cumulative economic sanctions,
diplomatic shaming and isolation, sustained insurgency against an
occupier, or an eventual military counterattack, a prospective aggressor
has ample opportunity to imagine that it will be able to find a way to
avert much or all of the eventual response. This is particularly true if
the response will be costly to carry out, or will depend on maintaining
the unity of an international coalition, or requires the deterrer to
remain politically committed to protecting an interest that it does not
hold dear.

[REGIONAL AND GLOBAL **EXPANSION**]{.underline}

Since the 1970s, [China has incrementally sought **opportunities** to
gain **power** in the vital waterways of the **S**outh **C**hina
**S**ea]{.underline}, home to critical maritime routes for commerce
movement, and rich with reserves of natural gas, oil, and active
fisheries. [China\'s **aggressive** regional tactics in the South China
Sea include Exclusive Economic Zone (**EEZ**) encroachments, attempts to
**exclude** other nations\' warships from operating in the free waters
of the region, and hostile **uncorroborated** territorial
claims.]{.underline} In 2015, [China built **artificial islands** in
international waters and subsequently **militarized** these
islands]{.underline}. In a continued attempt to gain overt control of
the South China Sea region, [China continues to **escalate** its
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) tactics as the nation overreaches
international norms, aggressively projects power, and dismantles
stability in the local region (Kuok, 2019).]{.underline}

Th[e Chinese government **intentionally** makes it difficult for other
nations to navigate unrestrictedly in the **S**outh **C**hina
**S**ea]{.underline}. Ms. Lynn Kuok, a researcher at the University of
Cambridge, contends, China\'s \"actions in the South China Sea, where it
has aggressively pursued its territorial and maritime claims, undermine
the rules-based order" (2019). Ultimately, Ms. Kuok believes China\'s
actions significantly weaken the long-standing international sea
regulations (Kuok, 2019). China's policy and dominance in the region
also provides it with maritime strategic dominance in the critical
Indo-Pacific shipping region (Macaraig & Fenton, 2021). In his analysis
of President Biden's 2021 National Security Strategic Guidance, retired
Army Colonel, Dr. Hinck states, "if China controls the South China Sea,
then China will be able to hold hostage more than 30 percent of the
world trade" (2021). At the regional level, [China\'s actions in the
South China Sea demonstrate intentional **disrespect** for international
order]{.underline} (Kuok, 2019). On the world stage, China's continued
expansion around the world demonstrate the nation's desire to increase
its stronghold on a global level.

CHINA\'S ARCTIC STRATEGY

In 2018, [China proposed its first Arctic strategic guidance. In this
strategy, the Chinese Government declared itself as \"a **near-Arctic
State**\"]{.underline} [with an **essential stake** in the Arctic
region]{.underline} despite the nearest access point being nearly one
thousand nautical miles from China (Biedermann, 2020). In this document,
China highlights the importance of protecting the region environmentally
while abiding by international law (Zoltai, 2021). Although seemingly
unobtrusive, regional experts believe [China\'s strategy is the
foundation]{.underline}, and the first step, [to China\'s]{.underline}

**[quest for power]{.underline}** [in the **Arctic**
region]{.underline}. In the same strategy document, the [Chinese
government introduced the concept of the \"Polar Silk
Road,\"]{.underline} an element of the 2013 Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) (Biedermann, 2020). [The BRI is an **expansion strategy** and
\"widely acknowledged as a central diplomatic and economic policy of the
Chinese government"]{.underline} (Jiang, 2022). The \"Polar Silk Road\"
is forecasted to connect China and the Nordic States through Russian
territorial seas using the Northern Sea Route (Lackenbauer & Koch,
2021).

China\'s jurisdictional rights in the Arctic region align with
non-Arctic nations in the unique Arctic governing structure (Biedermann,
2020). In 2013, China, a non-Arctic nation, obtained a coveted permanent
observer position on the Arctic Council alongside eight Arctic Nations
and six observer states (Chang & Khan, 2021). This council of nations is
the only governing body in the region, and the involved parties have
worked together to maintain peace. [The Chinese government\'s
confirmation as a permanent observer on the Council was a significant
achievement to enacting China\'s Arctic strategy. China recognizes the
**benefits** of having access to the **Arctic** and seeks **influence**
in this geographic region despite having no official legal
nexus]{.underline} (Lackenbauer & Koch, 2021).

The better we understand why Russia intends to increase its geopolitical
and geostrategic position and role in the regional arena, the better we
can realize why and how the [Russian **revisionist policy** has been
developing since 2008,]{.underline} from Europe to the Middle East, via
the Caucasus region. Since 2008: a) [Russia **prevented** NATO's
expansionist policy through the **wars** in Georgia, Crimea and Ukraine.
Russia returned stridently to the international arena]{.underline}; b)
[Russia has **consolidated** its position as a leading and dominant
power in the Caucasus region]{.underline}; c) It [took **action** in the
Middle East and **defended** its **strategic interests** in
Syria.]{.underline}

[Moscow uses all the **necessary factors** available to **realize** its
revisionist strategy]{.underline}. Such factors are:

[Military strength]{.underline}. The first level is that of a preventive
strategy. The second is that of the Russian aim to consolidate its
strategy either with force---as occurred in the cases of Georgia,
Crimea, Syria and Ukraine---or in the shadow of its power.

[Gas and oil]{.underline}. Russia uses the pipelines like 'energy
divisions' to serve its interests and increase its political influence
over states and governments.

[Technology]{.underline}. Russia combined conventional and cyber
techniques and tactics in the wars that it led from 2008. Its
conventional military forces include sophisticated weapons such as the
missile systems of S-300 and S-400 and the hypersonic missiles (3M22
Zircon) that combined with its extended cyberwar capabilities provide
Russia with the chance to attenuate the advantage that the US holds in
the sea due to its tremendous war fleet power.Footnote41

[Historical and imperial Russian consciousness]{.underline}.Footnote42
Moscow has an imperial identity and consciousness, military power,
national resources and a pivotal geopolitical position in the core of
the Heartland. By combining these factors, Moscow fuels its political
machine to accomplish its strategic missions and targets.

[Russian minorities]{.underline} existing [in other states are used by
the Kremlin as **strategic instruments** to achieve its **national
goals**]{.underline}. This [phenomenon is evident in the cases of
**Crimea** and **Ukraine**]{.underline}. Minorities also exist in the
Baltic States and other countries, which emerged in the regional system
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Therefore, this specific issue
of minorities takes wider and more complicated dimensions. It is also
relevant to political and legal motives and the right to
self-determination, the exercise of which depends on conflicting and
convergent national interests of the parties involved as well as the
uniqueness of each case. Moreover, humanity experienced tragic
implications when Adolf Hitler exploited the Sudeten Germans as a
strategic instrument to occupy Czechoslovakia paving the way for the
Second World War. It is not a new strategic practice. Therefore, history
repeats itself because the feeling of national integration cannot be
easily suppressed.

[The **lack** of an adequate European and **American preventive
strategy** is a quasi-**ally** of Russia which pursues to
**restructure** the **international system** and promote its
**revisionist** strategy]{.underline}. The [American and
European]{.underline} expansionist [policy offered Russia the pretext to
put forward a preventive and then a revisionist policy in Georgia,
Crimea, Syria and Ukraine]{.underline}. Moscow seized the opportunity to
make its case by accusing the US and NATO of following an aggressive
strategy that put Russian security at stake. While [Russia]{.underline}
argues that it is in defence, at the same time, it [promotes its
**revisionist**, even **belligerent** strategy, which partially induces
a **redistribution** of power and the restructuring of the regional and
international system in line with its hegemonic strategic
goals]{.underline}.Footnote43 Whether this policy will be successful and
to what extent, is something that only time can tell. The war in Ukraine
seems to be a cornerstone for the future structural changes in Europe
and worldwide. Russia pursues to raise itself as a game-changer. The
relevant question is: What structural changes the Russo-Ukrainian War
could bring about?

Of all states, [Russia has by far the most **significant** intrinsic
**interests** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [The Russian North accounts
for]{.underline} "**[20 percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} \[its
**[GDP]{.underline}**\] [and 22 percent of the total Russian
export]{.underline} \[...\]. [The region's **economic promise** lies
primarily in its rich natural **resources** and its potential as an
attractive maritime transit **passageway**]{.underline}" (Zysk 2010, p.
105), [making Arctic resources a matter of **strategic
importance**]{.underline}. [Its Arctic coastline is]{.underline}
24,140km long, stocked with several large cities, and [inhabited by
**two million** Russians]{.underline}. Canada and the US have combined
Arctic populations equal to less than a quarter of that number (cf. Shea
2019a).

[In its **Arctic Strategy Through 2035**, the Russian government
**emphasizes** the need to ensure military security, defense, and
protection of its state borders and highlights the **importance** of the
Arctic as Russia's **resource base**]{.underline} (cf. Kluge & Paul
2020).

Overall, [the Arctic is of **outstanding importance** for
Russia]{.underline} \[...\] [**economically** and **strategically** with
the vast hydrocarbon resources found and expected to be found, as well
as **ideologically**]{.underline}, [given]{.underline} \[...\] its
[ambition to restore Russia's political standing
internationally]{.underline}

Keil 2014, p. 170

[Russia will **increasingly** look to the Arctic for resource
development as current supplies **shrink**]{.underline}. [Its interests
lie in claiming potentially **resource-rich territory**.]{.underline}
[While UNCLOS already gives Russia a significant maritime presence in
the region, it is yet **claiming** continental shelves to **expand** its
sphere of influence]{.underline} (cf. Howard 2010). Besides, in terms of
resources, [the **Russian Security Strategy** states that "it **can't be
ruled out** that military force could be used for **resolving** emerging
problems,"]{.underline} [naming the Arctic a new **area** of **potential
conflict**]{.underline}, [since]{.underline} "\[t\]he existing [balance
of forces near the borders of the Russian Federation \[...\] can be
violated." (Harding 2009)]{.underline}

[Another main **interest** lies in the expected increase in **traffic**
and **activity** in waters Russia claims internal]{.underline}. Much
like Canada and the NWP, the Russians claim legal authority over the NSR
and contest America's interpretation of it as an international waterway
(cf. Zysk 2010). "In the Northern Sea Route, [Moscow]{.underline}
already [illegally demands other nations **request permission** to
pass]{.underline} \[...\] [and **threatens** to use **military force**
to sink any that fail to **comply** with their demands.]{.underline}"
(Pompeo 2019)

Scopelliti and Conde Pérez (2016), with a particular emphasis on Arctic
military dynamics, outline the radical changes that occurred following
the Russian flag-planting in 2007. Although the event was considered a
political gesture with no legal effect, it aroused the Arctic states'
concern for regional security, causing anxiety over Russian behavior in
particular. [To restore its **standing** of great power, Moscow adopted
an **increasingly assertive** posture through **military presence** in
the region]{.underline} (cf. Murray & Nuttall 2014). More precisely, [it
has started to **modernize** its Northern Fleet and set up a new
**Arctic Brigade** near the Finnish border]{.underline} (cf. Klimenko
2014). [In addition to an **8.1% increase** in general **military
spending**, Moscow has published a **new military doctrine** indicating
US and NATO enlargements as a major **threat** to its
security]{.underline} (cf. Perlo-Freeman & Wezeman 2015).

[Russia is **determined** to increase its **presence** in the Arctic to
protect its **national interests** and]{.underline} security while at
the same time adhering to the principles of international law and
cooperation. This creates a conflict that Rowe (2009) described as the
tension between the 'open' and 'closed' North, meaning that Russian
Northern Policies often include both more external inclinations,
exemplified by cooperation, as well as a tendency to increase
securitization and defense of national interests. This tension is
evident in the fossil fuel sector, where Moscow regularly must balance
the market and strategic concerns (cf. Keil 2014).

[Russia]{.underline}, under Putin, [aims to develop the Arctic to boost
its economy]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, in the aftermath of
Crimea's annexation, [is feeling the **brunt** of Western **sanctions**
and economic **isolation**.]{.underline} This has shown that Russia is
also seeking to protect Arctic assets in ways that have begun to attract
the US and Northern European attention (cf. Lanteigne 2019). While the
Russian Federation postulates that its expansion into the Arctic is
purely economic, the reality of military hardware in the region tells
otherwise.

A key obstacle to Arctic access remains technology. Icebreakers are
necessary for presence and power projection. So are functioning naval
bases. However, it is a heavy investment to build icebreakers, with
production times of 8--10 years, costing about \$1 billion each (cf.
Ebinger & Zambetakis 2009). The various Arctic nations have widely
divergent capabilities. Markowitz describes the year of the Russian
flag-planting, 2007, as 'the shock', measuring significant behavioral
changes by Arctic nation-states since then. Before the shock,
[Russia]{.underline} had by far the largest Arctic fleet. Yet, since
2007, it [has built **more** icebreakers than any other state, hence
**accumulating power**]{.underline}. Today, it has a fleet of 61
commissioned ships, with a further ten under construction. [It is also
the only country to operate nuclear-powered icebreake]{.underline}rs
(cf. Markowitz 2020). President Putin, at the International Arctic
Forum, stated:

\[Russia\] will continue to update \[its\] icebreaker fleet and to
increase the production of ice-class vessels. Three new nuclear-powered
icebreakers \[...\] are being built here in St Petersburg

Putin, 2019

[This unique capability enables Russia to project power year-round in
the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}. To put its ice-capable fleet in
perspective, Canada, second only to Russia in Arctic territory, has
eight active vessels (cf. Canadian Coast Guard 2021), while the US has
only one functional icebreaker (cf. The Associated Press 2020).

Furthermore, [Moscow is **rushing** to reopen Soviet military, air, and
radar bases on **Arctic islands** and to build **new
ones**]{.underline}. Regularly releasing images of troop training in the
High North (cf. Osborn 2017), [Russia has constructed **four** new bases
since the shock and reopened an additional **thirteen**]{.underline}.
[It had an astonishing **27** active bases above the Arctic Circle in
**2017**]{.underline}. Besides, [it has **invested** more in building
**infrastructure** and **facilities** that allow larger troops, more
supplies, and advanced weapons systems to be **stationed**]{.underline}
(cf. Markowitz 2020). [By comparison, the US only maintains **one
military base** above the Arctic Circle]{.underline}, on borrowed land
in Greenland (cf. Cook 2020) and Canada has only three (cf. Shea 2019b).

[Russia has]{.underline}, by most measures, [become the **dominant
power** in the Arctic. It has the]{.underline} world's [largest
fleet]{.underline}, capable of operating in extreme northern waters
throughout the year and maintains dozens of military bases in the
region. Moreover, it [has stationed new troops, increased submarine
activity, and returned warplanes to the Arctic skies]{.underline}, where
NATO airspace is now routinely being buzzed (cf. Shea 2019a). However,
Russia's build-up and swaggering, echoing moves in Crimea and
Kaliningrad, has been noticed in Washington.

Under the impact of climate change and the subsequent increase in human
presence across the Arctic, Russia will find it harder to secure its
'new' Northern border in the AZRF. So far, [Moscow's response has been

[leading to **perimeter control** and **sovereignty enforcement** as

[Russia's imperative]{.underline} to remove tension from the Arctic
[is]{.underline} consequently [adding pressure on **critical regional

the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, the
Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) gap, and the 'Bear gap' (between the
Svalbard archipelago, Bear Island, and mainland Norway) as well as in
the Pacific Arctic across the Bering Strait.

[In the High North, Russian actions are **heightening
tension**]{.underline} across the North Atlantic sea lines of
communication and on the Nordic-Baltic continuum regarding NATO
reinforcements. As the Atlantic Alliance is taking stock of the Finnish
and Sweden accession, more policy attention will be required to

Meanwhile, [the Kremlin is currently taking stock of how Finland and

recently agreed to the creation of a Multi Corps Land Component

Finnish troops.

The Balance of Arctic Powers

[Neorealism]{.underline}, as discussed, [predicts that states will
attempt to maximize security by using military power]{.underline}.
Therefore, they may pursue several strategies, including power
projection, increasing economic capabilities, and seeking alliances. To
pursue security in a self-help system, Moscow and Washington should
increase military and latent power to, ultimately, reach regional
hegemony. [The brief case study shows that, following the largest
**retreat** of sea ice in **2007**]{.underline} ('the shock'), [Russia
began **increasing** its Arctic **activity** by claiming
resource-rich]{.underline} (e.g., Lomonosov ridge) [and strategically
significant]{.underline} (e.g., the NSR) **[territory]{.underline}** [to
boost its national **power**]{.underline}. Besides, it increased its
partnership with China and focused on infrastructure development to
raise economic performance.

As noted in Chapter I, Mearsheimer believes that all [great powers
strive to accumulate power over rivals, with the ultimate goal of
**hegemony**]{.underline} (cf. Mearsheimer 2001, p. 40). While the US is
the most powerful state in the system, it cannot dominate the world. Due
to its minor role in the Arctic, it motivates other states to increase
their power to secure their position in the system. [With Washington
largely absent from the Arctic, Russia expanded its economic investment
and military activity, becoming the regional hegemon as defined by
Mearsheimer]{.underline} (2001, p. 232).

Neorealism differentiates latent and military power (cf. Keohane 1984,
p. 55). When calculated in both terms, [the balance of power between
Russia and other Arctic states **drastically favors**
Russia]{.underline}. With the largest Arctic territory and population,
it generates a significant amount of its latent power in this
resource-rich area. This allows it to operate the largest fleet of
icebreakers, Arctic military bases, and troops. In these quantitative
terms, the power structure in the Arctic is clear: Russia is a great
power in the High North, and the US, with only one functioning
icebreaker and not a single independent Arctic military base, is not.

[This has **substantial implications** for the Arctic
region]{.underline}. [Mearsheimer states that if the structure is
**multi-polar** and **unbalanced**]{.underline}, [it will be much more
**prone to conflict** since **regional powers** seek
**dominance**]{.underline}. Other states may then seek alliances (cf.
Mearsheimer 2001, p. 344). This is where Walt's balance of threat
approach becomes a useful analytical tool. In predicting the formation
of alliances between states, Walt (1987, pp. 21-22) defines threat
perception as a crucial determinant. [The threat]{.underline} --in this
structure-- [comes from Moscow]{.underline}. As a reaction to Russian
power projections and military build-up, [neorealism would expect
smaller powers to **pursue security** by **bandwagoning** with
Washington.]{.underline}

[This can be observed in several collaborations]{.underline}: while
[Canada, Denmark,]{.underline} and [Norway]{.underline} have
collectively increased their Arctic military activity in partnership
with the US through NATO, [Finland and Sweden]{.underline} are
conducting regular Arctic military training with Norway and the US (cf.
Hultqvist 2020). Eventually, [Denmark and Iceland]{.underline} grant US
military presence on their territories in Keflavik and Thule.

Finally, although the Arctic is shaped by cross-national cooperation
through forums and regimes (e.g., UNCLOS, AC), [we can find evidence
that states **ignore** or **break** the rules established by such
**institutions**]{.underline}: while President [Putin]{.underline}
officially [claimed]{.underline} that "\[a\]ll [decisions by the Arctic
Council are nothing more than **recommendations**]{.underline}" (Putin
2019), [Canada and the US **boycotted** an AC meeting following Russia's
intervention in Ukraine]{.underline} (cf. Rahbek-Clemmensen 2017).
Moreover, [NATO issued a **general ban** on cooperation with
Russia]{.underline} and, due to conflicting interests, a total of [15
bilateral events between Oslo and Moscow were **canceled**]{.underline}
(cf. ibid.). Although giving lip service to Arctic cooperation, [Russia
**increased** flights, **violated** NATO-states' border sovereignty, and
**conducted** unauthorized intercontinental ballistic missile tests in
the region]{.underline} (cf. ibid.). Finally, due to the denial of
climate change by the former US government, the AC was unable to release
an official declaration after their meeting in 2019 (cf. Lanteigne
2019).

Conclusion

Although [neorealism]{.underline} has been much criticized for its
revisionist character and inability to explain change (cf.
Korab-Karpowicz 2017, Ch. 3.2), it [has provided appropriate
**assumptions** in an **opening Arctic**]{.underline}. The study found
that [thawing ice caps led the Arctic states to pursue resources to
boost their economic and military power]{.underline}. Moreover, this
pursuit of economic development has increased human activity and
security threats in the region, leading to an expansion in Arctic
military capability by both Russia since 2007 and, more recently, the
US. Furthermore, the paper investigated Arctic power structures and
found that [Russia's regional geographic, economic, and demographic
domination resulted in weaker Arctic states' **bandwagoning**
behavior.]{.underline} This was primarily observable in military
cooperation through NATO and the reopening and development of US bases
on Icelandic and Greenlandic territories. Finally, [as neorealism would
**expect** states to ignore the rules established by international
regimes when it is in their interest to do so, the illegal penetration
of NATO airspace, the boycott of AC meetings, and the refusal to make
joint declarations provided some **grounds**.]{.underline}

### Russia Bad Impacts

#### Increasing Russian Arctic presence causes [miscalculation]{.underline}.

**Boulègue 24** --- Mathieu Boulègue, a Global Fellow at the Wilson's
Center Polar Institute, 2024 ("Russia\'s Arctic Military Posture in the
Context of the War against Ukraine," The Arctic Institute, October

[Russia's **low intensity** warfare operations in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}

[As a response to the sense of **vulnerability** in the AZRF, Russia is
becoming more **confrontational**]{.underline} [in its approach towards
**regional security** and finding **excuses** to **'defend'** itself
against perceived external threats]{.underline}. While the Kremlin is
taking stock of the consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO,
[Russia will likely conduct more **conventional power demonstrations**,
sub-threshold **activities**, and **grey zone** operations in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

[While there is **little incentive** for the Kremlin leadership to
escalate in the region]{.underline} per se, [there is also a **strong
willingness** to continue **probing** and **testing** the resolve of the
Arctic 7 through a well-established toolkit of **low intensity** warfare
operations]{.underline}. These sub-threshold operations and grey zone
activities mostly [take the form of]{.underline}:

[Brinkmanship-prone activities]{.underline}12) [through offensive
**peacetime maneuvers** at sea and in the air]{.underline}, especially
[close to the air defense identification zones]{.underline} (ADIZ) of
NATO countries and NORAD,

[Regular **snap military exercises**]{.underline}, [strategic bomber
overflights and patrol **activities**]{.underline}, [and the
**weaponization** of notices to air missions]{.underline}13) (NOTAM) in
the Barents Sea, across North Pole approaches, and close to the Bering
Strait and Alaska -- including with China14),

[**Seabed** warfare activities]{.underline}15), and notably the
[disruption of critical **undersea infrastructure**]{.underline}
(**[CUI]{.underline}**) such as energy pipelines and fiber optic data
cables across Arctic chokepoints,

[GNSS/GPS **jamming** and recurrent electronic warfare
**operations**]{.underline}16) in Lapland and Finnmark in the European
High North -- [with **severe risks** for civilian and commercial
assets.]{.underline}

[Risks of **miscalculation**]{.underline}

[A more **vulnerable** yet **assertive** Russia in the Arctic, coupled
with more NATO **attention** towards the region, can only mean that the
**risk** of **miscalculation** provoked by civilian and military
accidents, incidents, and tactical errors will
**increase**]{.underline}. Because of the absence of clear lines of
communication and deconfliction between Russia and the Arctic 7
countries, [it could lead to **unintended escalation** and further down
the road, to military tension if not **conflict**.]{.underline}

This situation is worsened by the fact that [Moscow's **restraint** over
such events cannot be taken for **granted** anymore]{.underline} -- [as
exemplified by Russia's **continued** low intensity warfare operations
in peacetime against Arctic nations and NATO allies]{.underline}.
Finally, the [absence of Russian transparency regarding recent
**environmental** disasters]{.underline}17) in the region [adds more
complexity to **peacefully** solving potential **crises**.]{.underline}

Another form of risk relates to horizontal escalation -- i.e. military
tension from other theaters such as the North Atlantic or the North
Pacific spilling over into the Arctic. In the context of the Finnish and
Swedish adhesion to NATO, the Baltic Sea represents a key area for
horizontal escalation towards the Arctic.

Finally, [miscalculations could happen in the **context** of Russian
sharp power activities in **circumpolar governance**]{.underline} -- for
instance, the contestation of the Svalbard Treaty with Norway or
exploiting recent decisions18) by the UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) regarding Russia and the United States. As a
knee-jerk reaction, Moscow also recently threatened to withdraw from the
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).19)

Freedom of navigation?

The [main risk of miscalculation with Russia]{.underline}, however,
[pertains to Moscow's contestable interpretation of the]{.underline}
legal status of the [Northern Sea Route]{.underline}
(**[NSR]{.underline}**). For years, the Kremlin has been projecting the
NSR as a body of internal waters covered by Article 234 of the Law of
the Sea (also known as the 'Ice Clause'), therefore offering Russian
authorities the possibility to enforce 'non-discriminatory laws and
regulations'20) over ice-covered areas.

#### Russian Arctic expansionism [spikes]{.underline} the risk of conflict.

[The obvious source for possible **conflict**]{.underline} [is the
increasing **human contact** and the **claims** put forth by the various
Arctic **nations**]{.underline}. One nation making such claims in the
Arctic region has made a concerted effort to assert or expand its
sovereignty in other areas of the globe recently; that nation is Russia.
[The]{.underline} Russian Federation already [derives **20 percent** of
its gross domestic product from **economic activity** in the
Arctic,]{.underline} and [its claims would expand its reach to make
further economic growth **possible**]{.underline}.12 Over the past
five-plus years, [Russia has **systematically embarked** on a program to
establish **new** or **refurbish** abandoned military bases in the
Arctic]{.underline} (see figure 4). [The reasons for this effort include
providing protection to the emerging **N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute and
**securing** its **economic interests**]{.underline}. As already noted,
the Northern Sea Route has the potential to provide great benefit to
Russia through direct trade or the facilitation of trade between Asia
and Europe. Further, [should Russia win its claims on the outer
continental shelf, it will control **vast areas** and **resources** to
its benefit]{.underline}.13 Thus, [refurbishment and expansion of new
bases is an **effort** to secure what Russians believe is
**theirs**.]{.underline} However, [this gives rise to the strong
**possibility** of **conflict** if other nations do not accept **Russian
claims**.]{.underline}

A reason for concern that Russia may press its claims even if the UN
decides against it is based upon recent developments in other regions.
As we have seen over the past four years, [Russia has **aggressively**
pressed forward with **territorial claims** in its "near abroad" at the
**expense** of Russia's neighbors]{.underline}.14 [Russia annexed Crimea
from Ukraine in a **brazen land grab**]{.underline}. Later, under the
pretense of protecting ethnic Russians, [it fomented a war with Ukraine
to **seize territory**]{.underline} on its western border with Ukraine.
Most recently, [Russia has **intervened** in Syria]{.underline} on
behalf of Bashar al-Assad's government to prop that regime up to ensure
its survival as well as to enable Russia to gain access to new locations
in Syria from which to stage both Russian air and sea power in the
Mediterranean Sea and Middle East. This raises the question, [Would
Russia move in a **similarly** aggressive manner to establish **military
hegemony** and control over much of the **Arctic**?]{.underline}

[Western countries imposed **extensive sanctions** on Russia after the
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022]{.underline}. But [the
measures]{.underline} were unilateral and piecemeal -- and while they
[have been **effective** in disrupting the Russian economy,
**evasion**]{.underline} and 'trade deflection' through third countries
[**limits** their impact]{.underline}.

On 24 February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The response by the West -- including Australia, Canada, the European
Union (EU), Japan, the UK and the United States -- was to impose an
unprecedented raft of far-reaching unilateral sanctions against
President Putin's regime (see Figure 1).

These included restrictions on Russia's financial sector (including its
central bank); the removal of Russia from SWIFT interbank transactions;
and new rules on goods and services in strategic sectors of the Russian
economy (such as aviation, energy and shipping). Also announced were
sanctions on a wide circle of designated individuals, including those
close to Putin; those facilitating the military action (such as the
Wagner Group); soldiers and officials in occupied Ukrainian territory;
and oligarchs with assets in Western countries deemed to be associated
with Putin or with interests in critical sectors (EU Commission, 2024).

The 2022 round of sanctions built on measures first introduced in 2014
(in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and neighbouring areas).
Subsequent policies have been brought in to address the evasion of
sanctions, extending their reach to 'enablers' of the war based outside
Russia and to the individuals committing war crimes and breaches of
human rights in occupied Ukrainian territory.

To gain an understanding of the wide effect of the sanctions, there is
an EU sanctions tracker, a United States tracker and a searchable
database maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
The UK has also published a list of people sanctioned under the 2018
Anti-Money Laundering Act, and there are regular updates on measures
taken to curb Russian aggression (UK government, 2025).

[There are]{.underline}, of course, some **[gaps]{.underline}** [in the
**sanctions regime**]{.underline}, and [to some extent Russia has
managed to **evade** their full **effects**.]{.underline} For example,
the Kremlin has replaced pipeline exports of oil to Western Europe with
tanker-shipped oil to other countries through a 'shadow fleet'.

That being said, [the effect of Western **sanctions** on both Russia's
**GDP** and levels of personal disposable **income** has been
**considerable**]{.underline} (IMF, 2025). After three years of war,
[Russian GDP is now **10-12%** below pre-invasion
**trends**]{.underline}. Personal disposable income is 20-25% below
where it would have been without the conflict (Disney, 2023; Korhonen,
2023).

With both inflation and domestic interest rates in Russia currently
running at over 20% -- as well as the loss of foreign exchange reserves,
bankruptcies rising in domestic businesses and real estate, and
increasing difficulties in interbank and state bank transactions --
[Russia's economy looks **increasingly weak**]{.underline}. [All this is
happening against the backdrop of a **rapid expansion** of Russia's war
economy at the expense of both private sector spending and other public
sector activity.]{.underline}

Three years on, what questions remain about the use of sanctions?

[The aim of the sanctions against Russia has **two
dimensions**]{.underline}. The first is economic: [to
disrupt]{.underline} trade and \[~~cripple~~\] **[the Russian
economy]{.underline}** (that is, reduce its GDP). [The second
is]{.underline} political: [**supporting** Ukraine and **coercing**
Putin into bringing an **end** to the war.]{.underline}

affected by supply disruptions a decade ago.]{.underline} Since then,
Japan has been actively trying to secure its supply through rare earth
(RE) mine projects outside of China in order to reduce its dependence on
China. Based on an analysis of market developments and the activities of
Japan in recent years, lessons learned are applied to the US, which is
currently facing similar uncertainties. Conclusions lead us to question
whether supporting new RE mine projects is the best strategy for the US
to mitigate potential supply disruptions. Introduction Criticality of
certain raw materials has attracted considerable attention during recent
years. Special focus has been put on rare earth elements (REEs). Their
[different applications make rare earths (RE) crucial for the production
of renewable energy, energy efficient lighting and electric mobility on
the path to a green, low-carbon world economy.]{.underline} The
increasing demand for RE over the last three decades -- [RE became more
and more important from the end of the 1980s on]{.underline} -- is
expected to continue. This demand may accelerate as the relevance of RE
was once more acknowledged by resolutions reached at the UN Climate
Change Conference in Paris in 2015, which will consequently lead to a
necessary shift from CO2 emitting technologies to carbon-neutral
alternatives. Most technologies needed for this transformation rely on
RE (Alonso et al., 2012; de Koning et al., 2018; Hoenderdaal et al.,
2013). Their [increasing relevance, however, also highlights existing
**supply risks**, as their production is **concentrated** in **few
countries**]{.underline} (Mancheri et al., 2019; Nassar et al., 2015).
[Supply disruptions could **threaten** the success of a **sustainable**
economy]{.underline} (Moss et al., 2013; Rabe et al., 2017; Smith
Stegen, 2015). [This danger has become acute again in the current trade
dispute between the US and China]{.underline} (Lung and Pi, 2019). [As
the conflict apparently escalates, China seems to be seriously
considering **broadening** the dispute to include RE, as announced by
government officials and reported by state-friendly media]{.underline}
(Bodeen, 2019; Global Times, 2019; Hu, 2019). [China appears to be
willing to use its market dominance in rare earth production
strategically including using threats to interrupt the supply to the
US.]{.underline} Fears of such an escalation were prompted by the recent
visit of China\'s president Xi to the RE magnet manufacturer JL Mag
(Zheng, 2019[). As rare earths have become leverage in the conflict
between the two world powers, the **criticality** of RE has become an
**urgent** problem and supply risks are real again.]{.underline} The
current situation resembles the RE crisis caused by political tensions
between China and Japan almost a decade ago. In the years 2010 and
2011[, China tightened its export restrictions and cut off the supply of
RE to Japan, which caused supply disruptions and price
explosions]{.underline} (Mancheri, 2015). [The resulting RE crisis hit
Japan\'s economy hard and led to new initiatives in order to reduce
supply dependence from China.]{.underline}

4.3. [National governance: **China**]{.underline}

Since the early 2000s, [China\'s commercial and scientific
**activities** in the Arctic Ocean have **expanded**]{.underline}
\[112,113\]. The country\'s Arctic Policy released in 2018 emphasizes,
"[China attaches **great importance** to **navigation security** in the
Arctic shipping routes]{.underline}. [It has **actively conducted**
studies on these routes and continuously strengthened hydrographic
surveys with the **aim** to improving the navigation, security and
logistical capacities in the Arctic]{.underline}" \[114\]. [A
**proliferation** of **studies** on Arctic shipping by Chinese scholars
demonstrates the country\'s **rapid build-up** of expertise]{.underline}
\[\[115\], \[116\], \[117\], \[118\]\]. Since 2013, Chinese state-run
shipping line COSCO has sent cargo vessels, heavy lift ships, and
container ships to pioneer test voyages of the NSR, which 13.4% of
Chinese trade could use by 2030 \[119\]. [The **motivations** for these
surveys, expeditions, and commercial activities]{.underline} may partly
[stem from China\'s apparent need to **explore** the maritime Arctic as
broadly as possible in order to **credibly participate** in regional
affairs]{.underline}, since a more limited geographic scope might make
the state look less capable as an Arctic actor. In contrast, as Arctic
territorial states, Russia and Canada can more solely focus on the NSR
and NWP, respectively, without undermining their legitimacy as regional
stakeholders.

Recently, [Chinese **officials** and **academics** have begun to pay
attention to the **TSR**]{.underline}, arguably [**more** than other
maritime states]{.underline}. [China\'s interest in the forthcoming
route may be reinforced by the government\'s **lengthy time
horizons**]{.underline} \[120\], [which]{.underline} significantly
[outlast the average maximum policymaking time horizon **of 30
years**]{.underline} \[121\] that likely applies to most Arctic states.
Two Chinese scholars suggest, "Although the Central Passage does not
open for commercial navigation due to sea ice in the central region of
the Arctic Ocean, [with the **complete melting** of the Arctic Ocean ice
in **decades**, the strategic value of the Central Passage will be
**fully revealed**, and China must take **precautions**]{.underline}"
\[122\]. The Chinese government already appears to be doing so: to the
best of our knowledge, [China is the **only country** to have led
official **expeditions** of all **three** Arctic shipping passages,
including the TSR]{.underline}. In 2017, during an 83-day, 20000-NM
voyage, China\'s Ukrainian-built icebreaker, MV Xue Long (built in 1990
for Soviet logistics and resupply along the NSR, purchased by China in
1994, and rebuilt there in 2007 to support polar research and logistics)
sailed via the TSR en route to the NWP.10 Chinese state media heralded
this journey as the country\'s first crossing of the CAO \[123\]. Two
Chinese scholars similarly extolled, "China\'s eighth Arctic expedition
team crossed the Central Passage for the first time by icebreaker
Xuelong, successfully opening a new sea route linking Eurasia" \[122\].
The following year in 2018, China launched its first domestically built
icebreaker, MV Xue Long 2. The PC3 vessel can navigate throughout the
CAO in summer and embarked on its first expedition to the area in July
2020.

Both [China\'s Arctic Policy]{.underline} and publications by Chinese
scholars [posit that the TSR forms an **integral part** of a future
Arctic **shipping network**]{.underline}, one that China seeks to help
develop. China\'s Arctic Policy explains, "The Arctic shipping routes
comprise the Northeast Passage, Northwest Passage, and the Central
Passage," and affirms that [the country "hopes to work with all parties
to build a **'Polar Silk Road'**]{.underline} through developing the
Arctic shipping routes" \[114\]. This description represents a more
expansive vision of the Polar Silk Road (PSR) compared to its initial
conception as a more eastward-focused version of the NSR that Russia and
China would develop together \[124,125\]. [The PSR is intended to form
one of several **corridors** within China\'s **Belt and Road
Initiative**]{.underline}, a multitrillion-dollar plan to enhance trade

Eurasia, Africa, and beyond. [Certain Chinese officials may hold even
**greater ambitions** for the PSR]{.underline}: Yao Zhang, director of
the Center for Maritime and Polar Studies at the Shanghai Institutes for

suggested that the "Ice Silk Road" (another name for the PSR) could
represent "a new direction for future governance and cooperation" that
helps avoid "bottlenecks in regional governance and cooperation"
\[126\]. Such statements indicate that while the Chinese state and
associated entities officially support the existing international laws
undergirding Arctic shipping governance, [as the country\'s Arctic
activities grow, some representatives may be willing to point out
perceived shortcomings.]{.underline} At the same time, the admission of
China and four other Asian states as Arctic Council observers in 2013
and the participation of China, Japan, and South Korea in negotiations
regarding the 2018 Fisheries Agreement illustrates their integration
into existing regional governance structures, even as these still give
primacy to Arctic territorial states \[127\].

## Potential A/Os

Accessed 07-10-2025)//Lane

On April 4, [China's]{.underline} Ministry of Commerce [imposed **export
restrictions** on seven rare earth elements]{.underline}
(**[REEs]{.underline}**) [and magnets used in the
**defense**]{.underline}, energy, and automotive sectors in response to
U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increases on Chinese products. The
new restrictions apply to 7 of 17 REEs---samarium, gadolinium, terbium,
dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium---and requires companies to
secure special export licenses to export the minerals and magnets.

Q1: To what extent will the most recent export restrictions on rare
earths impact U.S. sourcing of these critical minerals for defense
technologies?

A1: There are various types of export restrictions: non-automatic
licensing, tariffs, quotas, and an outright ban. The new restrictions
are not a ban; rather, they require firms to apply for a license to
export rare earths. This development has three implications: first,
[there will likely be a **pause** in **exports** as the Chinese
government establishes this licensing system]{.underline}. Second,
[there is also likely to be **disruptions** in **supply** to some U.S.
firms]{.underline} given that the announcement also placed [16 U.S.
entities on its export control list, limiting them from **receiving**
dual-use **goods**.]{.underline} [All but one of the firms on the list
are in the **defense** and **aerospace** industries]{.underline}. It is
unclear how China will implement the new licensing system. And third,
the licensing system may be dynamic and could incentivize countries
across the world to cooperate with China to prevent disruptions in their
rare earths supply.

Q2: What is the significance of the focus on heavy rare earths given
U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities?

A2: [The restrictions apply to **seven** medium and heavy rare
earths]{.underline}: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,
lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. The United States is particularly
vulnerable for these supply chains. Until 2023, [China accounted for
**99 percent** of global heavy REEs processing]{.underline}, with only
minimal output from a refinery in Vietnam. However, that facility has
been shut down for the past year due to a tax dispute, effectively
giving China a monopoly over supply. China did not impose restrictions
on light rare earths, for which a more diverse set of countries
undertake processing.

Q3: [Why are rare earths **significant** to U.S. **national
security**?]{.underline}

A3: [REEs are **crucial** for a range of **defense
technologies**]{.underline}, [including F-35 fighter **jets**, Virginia-
and Columbia-class **submarines**, Tomahawk **missiles**, **radar**
systems, Predator **u**nmanned **a**erial **v**ehicles, and the Joint
Direct Attack **Munition** series of **smart bombs**]{.underline}. For
example, the F-35 fighter jet contains over 900 pounds of REEs. An
Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer requires approximately 5,200
pounds, while a Virginia-class submarine uses around 9,200 pounds.

[The **U**nited **S**tates is already on the **back foot** when it comes
to **manufacturing** these defense technologies]{.underline}. [China is
**rapidly** expanding its **munitions production** and acquiring
**advanced weapons systems** and **equipment** at a pace **five to six
times** faster than the United States]{.underline}. [While China is
preparing with a **wartime mindset**, the United States continues to
operate under **peacetime conditions**]{.underline}. Even before the
latest restrictions, the [U.S. defense industrial base struggled with
**limited capacity** and lacked the ability to **scale** up
**production**]{.underline} to meet defense technology demands.
[**Further bans** on critical minerals **inputs** will only widen the
gap, enabling China to strengthen its **military capabilities** more
**quickly** than the United States.]{.underline}

#### A strong defense industrial base [caps]{.underline} all conflict.

Accessed 07-10-2025)//Lane

Last month, [China's]{.underline} State Council [announced **stricter
controls** over the export of processed rare earth elements]{.underline}
(**[REE]{.underline}**) starting in October. REEs, a group of 17
elements, are used to manufacture magnets, lithium batteries, and other
products crucial to the defense, technology, and energy sectors.
Globally, [China produces **60 percent** of REEs and processes about
**90 percent** of them]{.underline}. [This monopoly is
**problematic**]{.underline} as [it leaves U.S. production of **defense
weaponry** and **electronics** at risk of **supply chain disruption** in
the case of a worsening US-China relationship]{.underline}. [The United
States needs to **diversify**]{.underline} its mineral sourcing and
processing, domestically or in cooperation with allies, [to reduce
over-**reliance** on China.]{.underline}

[The **U**nited **S**tates' **dependence** on Chinese imports of
critical minerals leaves American production capabilities
**vulnerable**]{.underline} on multiple fronts. The Department of
Defense (DOD) estimated that the [current U.S. national stockpile
already has a **shortfall** of **88 materials** and a potential
large-scale conflict with **China** will further threaten the supply of
**53 of them**.]{.underline} The U.S. Army needs REEs, a subset of
critical minerals, to install battery storage systems to generate
renewable electricity on its bases and set up an electric non-tactical
light-duty vehicle fleet by 2027 as part of its climate goals. On the
commercial side, the International Energy Agency predicts that global
demand for lithium batteries will increase by as much as seven-fold by
2030 due to the Western shift towards cleaner electricity generation and
usage. Goldman Sachs predicts that by 2030, 50 percent of vehicle sales
in the United States will be electronic vehicles (EVs), which require
lithium batteries. 

[Rising **geopolitical tensions** leave the United States at a
**disadvantage** should China choose to **restrict** its
exports]{.underline}, which it has recently begun to do due to the trade
war. In December 2023, China banned exports of mineral extraction and
separation technologies. The ban followed strict export permit
requirements for minerals key to magnets and computer chip production.
Since last year, China has ramped up its production of REEs by 13
percent. As a result, the price of the most profitable metal
neodymium-praseodymium, used in EVs and wind turbines, has been driven
down by 20 percent, the lowest in three years. Although dropping prices
from overproduction may seem lucrative for consumers in the short term,
[Chinese market dominance adds to the danger of the state **wielding**
its control over REE exports as **political leverage**.]{.underline}

By now the [impacts of supply chain **disruption**]{.underline} are
becoming all too familiar: [shortages, **inflation**, factory
closures]{.underline}, goods waiting at ports to be unloaded. All these
impacts are serious enough, but another more-hidden concern lurks just
beneath the surface: [the **impact** of supply chain failure on
**national security**]{.underline}, broadly defined as a nation\'s
ability to protect and ensure the well-being of its population.

This definition of ["national security" is **broader** than just the
defense industry or military-related efforts]{.underline}; [it also
could encompass]{.underline} the very ability of a [nation to ensure
economic **well-being**, public **health**, and protection of a
nation\'s key **infrastructure**]{.underline}. [Supply chain disruptions
cause general **economic disruption** and key **commodity
shortages**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} then in turn can, in fact,
[drive aggressive **national behavior** and international
**instability**]{.underline}. And ironically, [this **reactive
aggressive** national behavior can happen even if the health of a
national economy itself depends upon continued international **economic
interdependence**]{.underline}. Indeed, this very [interdependence can
create **vulnerabilities**.]{.underline} So a systematic effort, cutting
across agencies and public and private sectors, could be one way to
ensure these vulnerabilities are understood and mitigated.

Supply Chain Disruption and Conflict

Dispersed supply chains develop because actors find it\'s economically
advantageous to seek the least-expensive and most-productive sources of
supply. These [dispersed **chains**]{.underline} develop for good
reasons, but they [create **complicated interdependencies**]{.underline}
whose risks and vulnerabilities are sometimes not even understood, let
alone mitigated.

While the reasons for creating these chains lie largely with private
interest, the effects of [disruption]{.underline}---which can come from
sources ranging from malign human action to natural disaster---[are
**rarely localized**]{.underline}. When [shortages]{.underline} occur
[in one industry]{.underline}, the disruptions in one area nearly
[always **spill** into adjacent **companies** and
**sectors**]{.underline}. [Whole economies feel the **impact**, not
isolated actors.]{.underline}

Historically, nations have not yet resorted to war to ensure supply
chain security, but it might be a mistake to assume that such action
could never occur when circumstances become sufficiently dire.

The impact on vulnerable populations may be particularly dire. [Supply
chain disruptions]{.underline} do not just create higher prices and
shortages among high-end consumer products, such as cars. They also
[affect more-**basic commodities**]{.underline} such as generic drugs or
energy, increasing the cost of living and the provision of basic needs.

[This]{.underline} kind of [disruption]{.underline} can [create
**instability**]{.underline} more generally, [promoting conditions for
**conflict** between and within nations]{.underline}. For the most part,
nations try to maintain access to markets and resources by peaceful
means such as stockpiling, direct investment in partner nations, and use
of other financial incentives. However, there is no guarantee that such
competition will remain peaceful.

As affluent nations and individuals can find ways to mitigate shortages,
they may create blocs of "haves" and "have nots," where some actors have
enough but others cannot meet basic needs. "Haves" may find ways to more
directly change distribution, most likely at the expense of other "have
nots." Or "have" nations may try to forcefully safeguard what they have
gained and work to exclude competitors. In all these cases, the actors
are facing shortages, occasioned by interdependence, and seeking
security for themselves in ways that actually promote wider
international systemic instability.

**[Escalation of Conflict]{.underline}**

In some cases, [supply chain disruptions can have an even
more-**direct** impact than **general disruption**]{.underline},
[causing shortages of **commodities** the nation must have to ensure
**national security**.]{.underline} This kind of disruption can go
beyond matters of justice, equity, and general prosperity to
[threatening a nation\'s very **ability** to **defend** itself and look
after its citizens]{.underline}. Some examples are pharmaceuticals and
personal protective equipment, energy, food, raw materials used in
manufacturing, and semiconductors used in multiple different systems
including military applications. Such shortages can make the need for a
national government to act more dire and immediate and thus raise the
risk of conflict. In some cases, particular types of raw materials only
exist in certain places, so shifting to more-secure sources isn\'t even
possible.

[Supply chain disruptions create]{.underline} both
**[leverage]{.underline}** for some nations and reasons for other
nations to minimize leverage. For example, Taiwan currently dominates
the market for semiconductors, which in some respects gives it leverage
with other actors, including the mainland People\'s Republic of China
(PRC). Semiconductors are capital-intensive---a new fabrication facility
for semiconductors costs approximately \$4 billion, with some estimates
as high as \$12 billion, and can take three or more years to build.

This does not even account for the skilled labor, and points to the
difficulty of readily shifting production. As a result, Taiwan gains
considerable leverage over the PRC and indeed the world. However, this
very [dominance]{.underline}, plus its proximity to the PRC and its
dependence on the PRC for other commodities, may in fact [raise the
incentive for the PRC to take **aggressive military
action**]{.underline} to ensure access to a key commodity. Such action
could range from a "quarantine" to military threats to an actual
invasion.

Aggressive action may stop well short of outright war, yet still be very
dangerous for actors in the system. The problem of security
vulnerability overall is complicated by the complexity and spread of
supply chains across the world. A nation might not be able to
successfully secure a commodity just by aggressive action against a
single other nation. However, that action against another nation
certainly could have the unintended effect of causing supply chains to
fail in a more general manner. Aggressiveness, while understandable and
probably predictable, might therefore also be extremely dangerous and
unproductive.

Conflict and Instability

Nations have gone to war in the past over natural resource shortages or
in an effort to secure key markets and labor pools. The need to secure
resources and markets was an explicit premise in German and Japanese
actions leading to World War II. Such conflict has occurred even during
times of significant interdependence between nations, such as in the
European system prior to World War I. [Historically, nations have not
yet resorted to war to ensure supply chain security,]{.underline} [but
it might be a mistake to assume that such **action** could never occur
when circumstances become sufficiently dire.]{.underline}
**[Interdependence]{.underline}** does create incentives to cooperate to
avoid disruption, but may [offer **few alternatives** for some
**desperate nations** if some part of the interdependent chain is
**broken**.]{.underline}

[Demonstrating the **political will**]{.underline} [to use **Arctic
capabilities**]{.underline} **[unilaterally]{.underline}** or in
conjuncture with allies and partners [is the]{.underline} other
**[prerequisite]{.underline}** [for successful **deterrence** and
**defense**]{.underline}. [The most important **priority** should be to
**convince** allies that the United States is a **reliable security
partner**]{.underline}. Some of that persuasion has already begun with
the Biden administration's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to
NATO's Article 5 security guarantees and Blinken's consultations in
Denmark before the May 2021 Arctic Council ministerial meeting.

[Persuading allies also requires **demonstrating** the ability to come
to their defense if **needed**]{.underline}, regardless of climate
conditions. **[Unilateral]{.underline}**, bilateral, and
"mini-multilateral" [**military exercises** are all useful as practice
and as **international signals** in the Arctic]{.underline}.
Unilaterally, the U.S. Army is starting to relearn how to operate in the
Arctic, as highlighted in its Arctic strategy. The U.S. Navy and Marine
Corps learned important lessons from NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in
2018 and smaller exercises since then. [More exercises are needed to
**demonstrate** to friend and foe alike that the U.S. military can again
**operate** in cold climates.]{.underline}

In addition, [the United States should **expand** its use of flexible
**basing**]{.underline} and deployment agreements with allies. The
recent agreement covering the U.S. military's use of the Ramsund naval
facility and Evenes air base in northern Norway are a good start. A
similar arrangement could be made for the Danish air force to have
permanent facilities at the U.S. base in Thule, Greenland, for search
and rescue, air surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and air
interdiction missions, something that could tie allied forces more
closely together, better defend this early warning facility, and improve
surveillance in the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap. Expansion of
the runway and facilities on Norway's Jan Mayen island and refurbishing
an additional airfield in Greenland in conjunction with the Danes could
serve similar purposes. Finally, the United States could coordinate
existing niche capabilities amongst Arctic allies, an Arctic version of
NATO's Connected Forces Initiative.

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, [NATO continues to be
of **vital importance** to American **security interests** in five
principal ways.]{.underline}

First, [NATO is at the core of]{.underline} one of the most significant
foreign policy accomplishments in American history---[the creation of a
**long-term peace** in **Europe** following the close of the Second
World War]{.underline}. [Because of **NATO**]{.underline} and the
emergence of the European Union, [Europe is **united** after centuries
of division and war. NATO's military strength has been a **major
reason** for the **absence** of **war** with the Soviet Union and Russia
since 1949.]{.underline}

A recent Atlantic Council study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent
of its GDP on defense during the First World War, 37.5 percent during
the Second World War and 13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We
spend nothing close to those levels now in large part due to the great
power peace we have enjoyed for over seventy years. [NATO has been a
**major factor** in that **peace**.]{.underline}

And [due to the expansion of NATO]{.underline} and the European Union
eastward after the fall of the Soviet Union, [millions of East Europeans
now live in free, **democratic** societies---a significant **success**
for U.S. diplomacy.]{.underline}

Second, [NATO delivers additional **benefits** to U.S. military
objectives]{.underline} and operations beyond our shores.

[NATO is at the heart of our defense of North America and Europe from
**nuclear** and **conventional** threats]{.underline}. British and
French nuclear weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the North
Atlantic area. Since the late 1940s, every Administration has believed
that the best way to defend our country is through American forces
forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies. This strategy remains
right for today given Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008, of Crimea
and Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and its current pressure on Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland. NATO remains our primary vehicle for deterring
Putin in Eastern Europe.

[The NATO allies host a great number of critical bases for
U.S.]{.underline} forces---Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy, Rota in
Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in Turkey---that serve as a
platform for our presence in Europe, as well as for U.S. force
projection against terrorist groups in North Africa and the Middle East
and for our continued military operations in Afghanistan.

Europe is a critical link in the development of our Ballistic Missile
Defense network focused on the Middle East with Turkey, Romania, Poland,
Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and other allies all
hosting elements of this system.

NATO allies continue to participate in the U.S.-led coalition against
the Islamic State in the Middle East.

Many of the allies play lead roles in other counter terror operations
such as French forces in Mali supported by the U.S.

In Afghanistan, the NATO allies remain with us in combat operations and
in training the Afghan military. Over 1000 soldiers from European and
other partner nations have died there during the last seventeen years.

NATO continues to maintain the hard-earned peace in Kosovo with European
troops bearing the large share of the burden. An EU-led force has taken
on all of the peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S.
for other activities.

Third, the [NATO allies are among our closest and most supportive
**global partners** as we confront the great transnational
**challenges** that define this century]{.underline}---the [fight
against **terrorism**, the entire complex of **cyber threats**,
**climate change**, the risk of **pandemics**, mass **migration** and
**others**]{.underline}. The [NATO]{.underline} allies and our partners
in the European Union act [together with us on these and **other
issues**]{.underline}. [This is of **incalculable benefit** to the
U.S.]{.underline} Neither Russia nor China have treaty allies. [NATO is
a significant **advantage** for the United States when it acts as a
**force multiplier** for American interests.]{.underline}

[Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in the region
among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as China. Melting sea ice
from rising global temperatures has created new military and economic
opportunities in the region.]{.underline} Since 1979, the Arctic has
warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, according to an
August 2022 scientific study published in Nature.3) As ice rapidly melts
in the Arctic, [increased access to critical rare earth elements, such
as platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel emerge. Moreover,
melting ice is opening more easily traversed Arctic waters, which has
led to a surge of both military and commercial ship activity in the
region. These two developments have increased the potential for conflict
in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a **strategic advantage.**]{.underline} [These minerals are
required for developing technologies ranging from renewable energy
systems to electronics used for national defense]{.underline}. According
to the [World Bank, the demand to produce minerals, many of which are
found in the Arctic, could increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to
meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.4) China already
dominates the global supply chain for critical materials. The United
States depends on these materials for its economic competitiveness and
national]{.underline} defense.5)

[As ice melts, new routes are emerging that are more
navigable]{.underline}. This has resulted in more ship activity in the
region. For instance, the Arctic Council Working Group on the Protection
of the Arctic Marine Environment reports that there has been a 37
percent increase in ship numbers and distance sailed in the Arctic over
the past ten years.6) [While much of this activity is commercial, Russia
and China have also taken advantage of the new sea routes to project
their naval power. They have carried out numerous regional deployments
and patrols, demonstrating their ability to execute military operations
in the austere Arctic climate.7) The expanded presence of Russian and
Chinese ships in the region poses a growing threat to NATO member
states.]{.underline} In October 2023, Finnish investigators suspected
the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor over the
seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one pipeline. While
the international community has not assigned blame wholly to China,
China later admitted to accidentally destroying an important gas
pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea in 2024. These
examples suggest that incidents of this nature could become more likely
as military activity increases in the region.8)

The DNI report, published on March 25, is chilling. [While it highlights
growing concerns over Chinese designs on Taiwan and Russia\'s ongoing
war in Ukraine, it fails to address the specific threats posed to the
Aleutian Islands, an obscure island chain off the coast of
Alaska.]{.underline}

[This warrants a course correction. While the Trump administration
obsesses over Greenland, China\'s assertiveness in the Alaskan Arctic
should be of major concern to the U.S. military and foreign-policy
establishment.]{.underline} [Consequently, the United States should make
defense of the Aleutian Islands a national security priority to offset
the possibility of a nuclear crisis in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has gradually
downscaled its military outposts around the island chain. In 1997, a
major naval base located on Adak Islandwas closed. Today, Washington\'s
adversaries have renewed their interest in the Aleutian Islands. While
remote, the chain is not impervious to Chinese and Russian military
predations.]{.underline}

Alaskan Sen. Dan Sullivan has recently expressed his concerns about

While Washington\'s extended nuclear deterrence mission against China
focuses on dissuading aggression against Taiwan, coercion of Japan and
South Korea, and the potential targeting of strategic positions such as
the U.S. territory Guam-all concerns located farther south in the vast
Pacific Ocean-[the threats that the United States and its regional
allies face from China in the Arctic are just as severe.]{.underline}

[Attempts to undermine long-standing territorial boundaries in the form
of provocative activities can also lead to increased tensions and could
escalate even further, turning critical island chains into theaters of
crises-or worse, war.]{.underline}

[For example, there are indications that China perceives the Aleutian
Islands as part of what is known as its first island chain.]{.underline}
AsAdm. Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese Navy, stated in
1987, \'the first island chain refers to the Aleutian Islands, the
Kurile Islands, the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan
Island, the Philippine archipelago, and the Greater Sunda Island in the
Western Pacific that form an arc-shaped arrangement of islands akin to a
metal chain.\'

To put Liu\'s claims into context, the Aleutian Islands comprise 14 main
islands and 55 smaller ones. These islands continue to host U.S. Naval
and Coast Guard forces. The distance between the westernmost island in
the archipelago, Attu Island, and the eastern coast of mainland China is
4,000 kilometers (nearly 2,500 miles).

[Yet in the aforementioned incident in July 2024, four Chinese military
warships were spotted in the Bering Sea. Such activities could lead to a
tense standoff in the United States\' backy]{.underline}ard. By
expending unnecessary foreign-policy attention in Greenland, Washington
risks being caught off guard. [Being prepared in the Alaskan Arctic
would enhance Washington\'s ability to deter conflict across the first
island chain-including the East Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the South
China Sea.]{.underline}

Taiwan has long been a focal point for analysts and policymakers alike,
and rightly so. However, as Sullivan warned in September,
\'authoritarian regimes are testing the United States. Congress and the
President should do more to deter further aggression. [We must continue
to send a strong message to Xi Jinping and \[Russian President
Vladimir\] Putin that the United States will not hesitate to protect and
defend our vital interests in Alaska and beyond.\']{.underline}

[Joint Chinese and Russian military naval and air patrols around the
Aleutian Islands should deeply concern the United States\' military and
foreign-policy establishment. Permanently reopening the naval base on
Adak Island would certainly be a vital first step in enhancing
deterrence around the region.]{.underline}

[When nuclear weapons states are involved, miscalculations can prove to
be gravely consequential]{.underline}. As RUSI analyst Jamie Kwong wrote
in 2018, \'the Arctic remains an important region in the global nuclear
security complex.\' The United States operates the North Warning System,
an early warning system intended to detect threats in the Arctic.
Deliberate or accidental Chinese actions that are perceived to be
threatening could trigger these U.S. early warning systems, and
detection could lead to defensive military action.

[In the fog of uncertainty, U.S. nuclear command and control would have
to make a decision that could precipitate a standoff-and a standoff
between nuclear powers always carries with it the inextricable risk of
nuclear escalation.]{.underline}

With tensions already running high, a deep distrust between China and
United States underpins the strategic environment. [An incursion into
U.S. territory could compel the United States to militarily engage with
Chinese assets.]{.underline} For example, should a Chinese jet fly into
U.S. Arctic airspace, or should a vessel stray into regional territorial
waters, the United States could opt to strike.

Accidental or inadvertent escalation also poses a risk. In September
2022, a Type 055 Nanchang guided missile destroyer came within 160
kilometers (about 100 miles) of the Aleutian Island of Kiska. It was
armed with up to 112 cruise missiles. The accidental launch of a Chinese
missile could push the protagonists to the nuclear brink. After all, the
strategic environment in the Arctic is already febrile, and costly
accidents can happen.

The threshold for U.S. military action in the Arctic remains unclear. A
Chinese crossing of a trip wire could also lead to escalating tensions
and trigger a nuclear crisis. [The United States should establish a
clear threshold in the Arctic in order to signal to its adversaries
which activities are tolerable and which would prompt a military
response.]{.underline} Trump stated in January that \'you don\'t even
need binoculars-you look outside. You have China ships all over the
place. You have Russia ships all over the place. We\'re not letting that
happen.\'

The United States should respond to the growing Chinese threat by
communicating red lines in the Arctic. Should the United States fail to
issue clear red lines to Beijing over military activities in the Bering
Strait and the northern Pacific, then Washington stands to unwittingly
encourage Beijing to take greater geopolitical risks close to U.S.
territorial boundaries.

[Beijing may perceive a lack of resolve as a source of encouragement to
escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Or worse, U.S. inaction might be
seen as a sign that Taiwan is there for the taking. If deterrence isn\'t
restored in the Alaskan Arctic, then the Aleutians could be next in line
to join Cuba and Taiwan in the annals of crisis history.]{.underline}

Instead of obsessing over Greenland, [the Trump administration should
focus on securing a part of the Arctic that already belongs to the
United States-lest the Alaskan frost turn into Arctic fire.]{.underline}

For years, [Moscow has prioritized the Arctic as a critical pillar of
its national security, opening or refurbishing over 50 military bases
and scaling up military operations across the region. The United States,
meanwhile, with a focus alternating between the Middle East and the
Pacific, has largely entrusted Arctic security to its allies and
partners in the region.]{.underline}

The problem: [One of those key partners, Canada, is by its own admission
unprepared to face the Arctic challenge. **Unless the US works quickly
to help fill that gap, it means American interests in the Arctic are
going to be at risk moving forward**.]{.underline}

[Historically, the United States has been protected by the operational
challenges of waging an Arctic offensive in frigid conditions. But the
growing prospect of a "Blue Arctic," ice-free for months out of the
year, could allow a great power adversary to deploy military assets
right in America's backyard for the first time in history.]{.underline}
Already, Russian and Chinese warships have been seen patrolling together
off the coast of Alaska in unprecedented numbers. As the US military's
former top commander for the Arctic, Gen[. Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy
said, the region is "no longer a fortress wall" and we must be prepared
to defend it.]{.underline}

[In the Arctic, Russia is not a "pacing threat" as China is in the
Indo-Pacific; it is well ahead of the United States.]{.underline} Russia
controls nearly 53 percent of the Arctic Ocean's coastline and has built
countless bases across the region. [Washington, meanwhile, only
maintains six bases and five of them are outside of the Arctic Circle in
southern Alaska.]{.underline} As of 2023, the United States Coast Guard
possessed only five icebreakers or ice-capable patrol ships which are
critical to maintaining a presence in the Arctic. Moscow, meanwhile, has
57 such vessels. It will be years before the American icebreaking fleet
is large enough to effectively support large-scale US operations.

In addition to rapidly scaling up its force posture, Russia has also
conducted unprecedented naval exercises and harassed American fishing
vessels in Arctic waters. [Moscow has begun to assert its control over
newly expanded shipping lanes through the Arctic like the Northern Sea
Route (NSR), declaring certain parts of this route to be internal
Russian waters with an aim towards regulating shipping that passes
through it.]{.underline}

In the future, Russia may try to expand its control over other Arctic
waters closer to the United States and present a direct threat to the
homeland and to US operations in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. [The

Moscow may try to create its own "'nine-dashed line' around the North

A NEW SWING STRATEGY-THROUGH THE ARCTIC

The first military asset to transit across the Arctic and the North Pole
was the USS Nautilus with Operation SUNSHINE in 1958 (Brown, 2014).
President Eisenhower's direction to provide this demonstration in the
wake of the Soviet launch of Sputnik was the beginning of Cold War
efforts to combine the ability to swing forces from military theaters
through the Arctic and to signal capability and resolve to adversaries
(Anderson & Keith, 2008; Griffin, 2013).

[The US military\'s \"Swing Strategy\" was a contingency approach
developed during the Cold War to address potential conflicts in Europe,
particularly the threat posed by the Warsaw Pact countries led by the
Soviet Union.]{.underline} In the event of kinetic hostilities between
the Soviet Union and NATO, the main body of the US Pacific Fleet would
'swing' to the Atlantic, in some planned circumstances moving before
conflict began (McCrea, et al., 1989). The movement would have involved
US aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, Army and Marine divisions and
B-52 bombers swinging from Asia to Western Europe, providing critical
surge capacity in case of a Soviet invasion of Europe (Evans & Novak,
1979; Walters, 1991). It was a secret US military strategy for about 25
years, beginning in the late 1950s.

[With the changing geopolitical landscape and the melting of the Arctic
ice, the US military could potentially adapt and modernize this strategy
to incorporate the Arctic region as an additional transit
opportunity]{.underline}. [In the context of a modernized Swing
Strategy, the Arctic could serve as a **strategic pivot
point**.]{.underline} With the opening of new sea routes due to melting
ice, the Arctic region could provide [a quicker and more direct route
for the US military and allies to move forces between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans. This route could allow the US to respond more quickly to
threats in either Europe or Asia.]{.underline} For example, in the event
of a conflict in Asia, US forces based in the Atlantic could use the
Arctic routes to \'swing\' to the Pacific more quickly than they could
via the Panama Canal. [Arctic routes would also provide resilience
should the Panama Canal be blocked due to weather or
hostilities]{.underline}. [Similarly, in the event of a conflict in
Europe, US forces based in the Pacific could \'swing\' to the Atlantic
via the Arctic, which could be **particularly important given the rise
of China as a major military power in the Pacific and the ongoing
tensions with Russia in Europe**, as well as the disruptions in key
maritime chokepoints, like the Suez Canal blockade, terrorist attacks in
the Red Sea, or Chinese control and denial of passage through the Panama
Canal.]{.underline} However, a viable swing strategy would require
sealift ships, and ships taken up from trade (STUFT) (Naval Historical
Society of Australia, 1990), to be ready and able to operate
consistently in the high-latitude, cold weather environment.

#### Plan is key to ensure a peaceful arctic

Arctic are Critical to the National Security of the United States". Army

Mitigating the Risk of Conflict

Since, the Arctic region is so self-evidently important to the United
States both economically and militarily, [we [must assert ourselves to
ensure that the region remains peaceful]{.mark}]{.underline} and is of
benefit to all nations as part of the global commons. So, what can the
U.S. military do to ensure this outcome?

[First, we must [ensure that we maintain and sustain a credible force in
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much recent discussion by senior political
and military leaders has centered on cutting force structure in
Alaska.15 In particular, the Army has considered drawing down the
airborne brigade combat team posted at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.
This would send the wrong message to potential adversaries that the
United States is not committed to protecting either its own interests
and claims, or Arctic security in general. This might encourage
aggressive actions on the part of nations, most prominently Russia,
seeking to seize and exploit opportunities within the Arctic region.

Second, U.S. forces must exercise frequently and visibly to demonstrate
our capability to secure our interests in the Arctic. Such exercises
should include joint forces and incorporate combined operations with
Arctic partners. By conducting joint and combined exercises, we send a
message to potential adversaries that we intend to secure our interests
and those of our partners in the austere environment of the Arctic.
Moreover, combined exercises demonstrate the interoperability of our
forces with partner nations for a deterrent effect.

Third, U.S. military forces have to regain Arctic skills to enhance
deterrence in the region. There is much work to be done. Over a decade
of war focused on counterinsurgency in the desert environment of the
Middle East and central Asia has left forces in Alaska with atrophied
Arctic survival and tactical skills and antiquated equipment. Further, a
major winter exercise in the Arctic targeted at the operational level of
war has not occurred in several years. To have a credible deterrence to
any nation's design for expansion in the Arctic, the United States has
to systematically rebuild and demonstrate its Arctic skills and
refurbish or field new equipment to give U.S. forces in Alaska a robust
capability to challenge aggressors.

Fourth[, U.S. [forces]{.mark} in the Arctic [require]{.mark}
technological and [equipment modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
same way that Arctic skills have atrophied over the past decade-plus, so
also has [the [equipment available]{.mark} to the force [become either
obsolete or difficult to maintain]{.mark} due to age]{.underline}. For
example, early-warning defense radar systems require modernization as
software becomes out of date and the purpose for which they were
designed has evolved. Additionally, [[ground mobility suffers from an
aged system that is difficult to maintain]{.mark},]{.underline} making
it a challenge to move ground forces in deep snow or mud. The M973 Small
Unit Support Vehicle (SUSV) is not viable since it is no longer a
program of record, and a material solution is required to enable greater
mobility for ground forces in the Arctic. [These are just two examples
of equipping needs among many]{.underline}. The bottom line is that
[[U.S. forces will require investment in materiel that facilitates
operating in the tough conditions of the Arctic]{.mark}. This is
essential to demonstrate our commitment to security in the
region.]{.underline}

#### American Arctic military presence is falling behind, but [revitalizing]{.underline} military bases solves. Otherwise, adversaries take the opportunity to [expand]{.underline} in the Arctic.

**Arctic**]{.underline}. [This is essential to **demonstrate** our
commitment to **security** in the region.]{.underline}

Finally, in conjunction with rebuilding Arctic forces' equipment and
effectiveness, commanders in Alaska need the authority to conduct
military-to-military consultations with counterparts around the
region[.]{.underline} We maintain this with most Arctic nations through
Alaskan Command's security cooperation line of effort. However, in 2013,
all consultations with Russia were curtailed. Lack of regular contact
with Russia continues to be a strategic gap that, with increased
competition as well as the already tense relations that prevail between
the two nations, could lead to misunderstandings and miscalculations
between the United States and Russia and potentially result in needless
conflict.

Regular consultation with Russia needs to be restored. The ability of
commanders from U.S. Army Alaska and Alaskan Command to consult with
counterparts in Russia would go far to reduce tension and assure clear
communication between the two nations. This simple step could go a long
way toward ensuring peace in the Arctic.

Conclusion

The U.S. position in the Arctic because of Alaska is of enormous
strategic significance. [The United States has **vital interests** in
the Arctic region]{.underline} that are unfortunately often overlooked
because turbulence in other areas of the world often draw more
attention. In time, these interests will come to be seen as both
critical and vital to our own long-term economic interests as well as
security. Consequently, [there is a need to **ensure** our interests in
the Arctic are sufficiently secured to ensure resolutions to
**territorial** and **resource claims** remain
**peaceful**.]{.underline}

To effect protection of our interests, the [United States has to
**assert leadership** using critical elements of national power,
including the **military**]{.underline}. [We must rebuild long-ignored
Arctic military capabilities to provide a **credible
deterrent**]{.underline} [to any **nation**]{.underline} that may want
to expand its territory outside of recognized international norms to
exploit the tremendous resources of the Arctic. As human activity
continues to increase in the Arctic, it [will become more and more
important for the United States to **demonstrate** its **strength** in
the region]{.underline}. [Failure to do so could allow the **friction**
of human interaction to grow into needless **regional confrontation**
with global **implications**]{.underline}. [This is **preventable** with
a commitment to leadership and peace in the region that stems from
**sufficient investment**]{.underline} and preparation.
